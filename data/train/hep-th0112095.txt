    "the field theory approach to phase transitions in disordered systems has realized major progress over the last few years , thanks to an ever deeper understanding of two dimensional field theories .",
    "conformal invariance , combined with elegant reformulations using supersymmetry @xcite , and a greater control of non unitarity issues @xcite , now severely constrains the possible fixed points @xcite . in some simple cases , perturbed conformal field theory , combined with the use of current algebra symmetries ,",
    "has even led to complete solutions @xcite .",
    "some of the models of interest in the context of disordered systems have also appeared independently in string theory @xcite , and more progress can only be expected from the cross fertilization between these two areas .    remarkably , the chief non perturbative method , the integrable approach , has not been pushed very far to study these models .",
    "this is a priori surprising .",
    "for instance , several disordered problems involve variants of the @xmath1 gross neveu model , which formally appears just as integrable as its well known @xmath2 counterpart .",
    "the standard way of proceeding to study such a model would be to determine its s matrix , and then use the thermodynamic bethe ansatz and form - factors to calculate physical properties .",
    "this approach was pioneered in the elegant papers @xcite , and revived in @xcite , but so far the subject was only touched upon in our opinion ; for instance , although the s matrix of the @xmath3 gross neveu model has been conjectured @xcite , no calculation to justify this conjecture has been possible .",
    "super sigma models have also been tackled , this time in the context of string theory @xcite , but there again results have only been very partial , and the s matrix approach even less developed than for super gross neveu models .",
    "the main reasons for this unsatisfactory situation seem technical .",
    "while there has been tremendous progress in the understanding of the sine - gordon model and the @xmath4 sigma models - the archetypes of integrable field theories - models based on other lie algebras are only partially understood ( see @xcite for some recent progress ) , and the situation becomes even more confusing when it comes to super - algebras .",
    "one of the main difficulties in understanding these theories is physical , and related with a general lack of unitarity - a feature that is natural from the disordered condensed matter point of view , but confusing at best from a field theory stand point .",
    "another difficulty is simply the complexity of the bethe ansatz for higher rank algebras , in particular super algebras .",
    "while these equations can be written sometimes ( see the recent recent tour de force @xcite ) , finding the pattern of solutions - the generalized string hypothesis - is a daunting task even for the trained expert @xcite .",
    "integrable field theories and lattice models go hand in hand , and the foregoing confusion seems to extend to spin chains based on superalgebras .",
    "although the formalism is by now well in place to write the integrable hamiltonians , their continuum limit is not well understood . in the case of ordinary algebras for instance",
    ", it is known that this continuum limit is a wess zumino model on the group : whether this is true or not for superalgebras has been a matter of some debate @xcite .",
    "note that in some cases , the super spin chain is better understood than the field theory : this is the case for instance of the @xmath5 spin chain of @xcite in the spin quantum hall effect , whose relation to the traditional ( super ) yang baxter formalism is also not understood at the present time .    our purpose in this paper is to develop the integrable approach for the case of @xmath1 field theories .",
    "we will discuss two kinds of models , the supersphere sigma - models , and the gross neveu models , mostly for algebras @xmath6 . in each case",
    ", we will conjecture a scattering theory , whose striking feature will be the lack of unitarity of the @xmath7 matrices , as a result of the super group symmetry .",
    "we will argue that formal thermodynamical calculations do make sense nevertheless , and illustrate this point for both types of models .",
    "there are two basic integrable models with @xmath2 symmetry , the gross neveu model and the sphere sigma model @xmath8 .",
    "once their integrability is proven , the scattering theory is determined by implementing the action of the symmetry on the space of particles , and by requiring factorization .",
    "this is not always an obvious task , because of issues of bound states and charge fractionalization .",
    "for instance , the scattering theory for the @xmath9 gross neveu model was completed only very recently @xcite .",
    "however , the scattering of particles in the defining representation has been known for a long time @xcite , and this is where we would like to start here .",
    "scattering matrices with @xmath2 symmetry can generally be written in terms of three independent tensors @xmath10 where we have set @xmath11 corresponding to the graphical representation in figure 1 .",
    "= 4.0 in    we are interested here in models for which none of the amplitudes vanish .",
    "specifically , for @xmath12 a positive integer , there are generically two known models whose scattering matrix for the vector representation has the form ( [ maini ] ) , with none of the @xmath13 s vanishing .",
    "they are given by @xmath14 with two possible choices for @xmath15 : @xmath16 the factor @xmath17 does not have poles in the physical strip for @xmath18 , and the corresponding s matrix for @xmath19 is believed to describe the @xmath20 sphere ( @xmath21 ) sigma model .",
    "the factor @xmath22 does not have poles in the physical strip for @xmath23 .",
    "for @xmath24 , it describes the scattering of vector particles in @xmath2 gross neveu model .",
    "recall that for @xmath25 the vector particles are unstable and disappear from the spectrum , that contains only kinks .",
    "some of these features are illustrated for convenience in figure 2 .",
    "= 4.0 in    note that at vanishing rapidity , the scattering matrix reduces to @xmath26 .",
    "this is in agreement with the fundamental particles being bosons in the sigma model , and fermions in the gross neveu model @xcite .",
    "our next step is to try to define models for which @xmath27 , in particular @xmath28 , or @xmath12 negative .",
    "a similar question has been tackled by zamolodchikov @xcite under the condition that particles be `` impenetrable '' , that is @xmath29 .",
    "the ( standard ) procedure he used was to study the algebraic relations satisfied by the objects @xmath30 for integer @xmath12 , extend these relations to arbitrary @xmath12 , and find objects ( not necessarily @xmath31 matrices ) satisfying them .",
    "in technical terms , the algebraic relations turned out to be the defining ones for the temperley lieb algebra @xcite , for which plenty of representations were known . the most interesting @xmath28 case ( corresponding to polymers )",
    "could then be studied using the 6-vertex model representation .",
    "it could also be studied using algebras @xmath32 , or algebras @xmath33 .",
    "= 3.5 in    the natural extension of what was done say for polymers would be to look for vertex representations of the birman wenzl algebra",
    ". however , this does not seem possible .",
    "the point is that the full birman wenzl algebra has two parameters , and the representation furnished say by the spin one vertex model will have , for instance , that @xmath42 .",
    "this is a property natural from the knot theory framework where this algebra comes from , but disastrous for the construction of physical @xmath7 matrices , where particles can not `` go under '' another .",
    "extending the definition of the s matrix to arbitrary values of @xmath12 thus seems problematic .",
    "it is easy nevertheless to extend it to negative integer values of @xmath12 . indeed ,",
    "the birman wenzl algebras arise from representation theory of @xmath2 , and most of the properties of these algebras generalize to the superalgebras @xmath1@xcite . instead of the vector representation of @xmath2 ,",
    "take the vector representation of the orthosymplectic algebra , of dimensions @xmath43 . for @xmath44 , the tensor product with itself",
    "gives rise to three representations .",
    "taking @xmath45 as the identity , @xmath41 as @xmath46 times the projector on the identity representation , and @xmath47 as the graded permutation operator ( the extension to the case @xmath48 is easy ) , it can be checked indeed that the relations ( [ bwi]),([tl]),([bwii ] ) are obeyed with @xmath49 . more explicitly , in the usual case , the matrix elements of @xmath41 are obtained by contracting the ingoing and outgoing indices using the unit matrix . in the @xmath50 case , they are obtained similarly by contracting indices using the defining form of the @xmath50 algebras @xmath51 in formulas , we set @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "we set @xmath55 , @xmath56 otherwise , so @xmath57 .",
    "one has then @xmath58 while the graded permutation operator is of course given by @xmath59 this realization of birman wenzl algebras was first mentioned in the very interesting paper @xcite .",
    "it thus follows that the natural ortho - symplectic generalization of the @xmath60 matrix of the @xmath2 gross neveu model ( or sphere sigma model ) does provide a solution of the yang baxter equation , and realizes algebraically the continuation to values of @xmath12 equal to zero or negative integers .",
    "let us now discuss how meaningful this can be physically .",
    "for this , let us recall some basic features about yang - baxter versus graded yang - baxter . in all cases , the yang baxter formalism deals with two related objects that are usually called @xmath61 in a general context , @xmath62 in the context of scattering theory , and differ by some ( graded ) permutations .    in the ordinary case , we reserve the unchecked symbol to the matrix obeying @xmath63 , where @xmath64 are spectral parameters .",
    "the equivalent of this relation for the superalgebra case is the graded yang baxter equation , and it involves signs @xcite : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the parity of the @xmath67 coordinate .",
    "these signs occur because , in the graded tensor product formalism , @xmath68 acts on the first and third components , hence giving rise to potential minus signs when commuting through the elements of the second component .",
    "an ordinary ( super ) r matrix does not solve the graded ( ordinary ) yang baxter equation .",
    "however , if @xmath69 does solve the graded yang - baxter equation , the object @xmath70 solves then the ordinary yang - baxter equation , so it is easy to go from one point of view to the other .    in the ordinary case",
    ", one can also consider the object @xmath71 , @xmath47 the permutation operator : this is what we gave in formula ( [ maini ] ) for the case @xmath12 a positive integer .",
    "it satisfies a different relation , @xmath72 .",
    "observe that this relation now involves only neighboring spaces in the tensor product , and thus is insensitive to grading .",
    "if @xmath69 were to solve the graded yang baxter equations instead , the same relation would be obeyed by the matrix @xmath71 , where now @xmath47 is the graded permutation operator . whether @xmath69 satisfies the ordinary or the graded yang - baxter equation",
    ", it follows that matrices @xmath73 do satisfy the same equation .",
    "conversely , a solution of @xmath74 can be interpreted as arising from a graded or a non graded structure .",
    "the graded yang baxter equation appears more as an esthetically appealing object than a fundamental one .",
    "it is especially nice because it admits a classical limit , and fits in the general formalism of quantum super groups @xcite .    in the context of scattering theories , which are our main interest here , it is convenient to define the @xmath7 matrix through the fadeev zamolodchikov algebra @xcite . theories based on supergroups will have a spectrum of particles containing both bosons and fermions .",
    "their creation and annihilation operators will be denoted @xmath75 , and obey for instance @xmath76 .",
    "the consistency of these relations requires that @xmath7 satisfies the graded yang baxter equation , or , equivalently , that @xmath77 satisfies the ordinary yang baxter equation .",
    "amplitudes of physical processes are then derived in the usual way .",
    "an important feature is that the monodromy matrix , which describes scattering of a particle through others , is built out of @xmath77 like in the non graded case ( the same thing happens for integrable lattice models @xcite ) .",
    "taking therefore our @xmath50 @xmath60 matrix , and the @xmath7 matrix that follows from it , @xmath78 , it is natural to ask about the physical meaning of these amplitudes .",
    "this reveals some surprises .",
    "crossing and unitarity are well implemented in the cases when the particles are bosons or fermions .",
    "mixing the two kinds does not seem , a priori , to give rise to any difficulty .",
    "for instance the relation @xmath79 holds in the graded case with proper choice of normalization factors .",
    "it will turn out however that in the graded case , the @xmath7 matrix is , as a matrix , * not unitary*. still holds , but unphysical signs appear in @xmath7 matrix residues . for a thorough discussion of unitarity issues see @xcite .",
    "] it is thus difficult to interpret our @xmath7 matrices in terms of a ` physical ' scattering .",
    "the most useful way to think of the @xmath7 matrices will probably be as an object describing the monodromy of wave functions , like in imaginary toda theories @xcite . crossing follows then from @xmath80 , with an obvious graphical interpretation , and charge conjugation being defined through the defining form of the @xmath50 algebra .",
    "leaving aside the unitary difficulty , the usual formal procedure thus selects once again the factors @xmath81 as minimal prefactors , with the continued values @xmath49 .",
    "the question is then to establish the relation what field theory , if any .",
    "obvious candidates are the @xmath1 gross neveu model with action ( in all this paper , normal ordering is left implicit ) @xmath82\\ ] ] where the @xmath83 are majorana fermions of conformal weight @xmath84 , and the @xmath85 are bosonic ghosts of weight @xmath84 as well .",
    "perturbative calculations of the beta function @xcite suggest that this model behaves like the continuation of the @xmath2 gross neveu model to the value @xmath49 .",
    "similarly , the natural generalization of the sphere sigma model is a super sphere sigma model , which can be described as the coset @xmath0 .",
    "there again , perturbative beta functions do match .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect that the s matrices built on @xmath1 will describe , depending on the prefactor @xmath81 , these two models in the appropriate physical regimes .",
    "this will be discussed in the next section .",
    "to make things more concrete , let us discuss the case @xmath87 , and its realization using @xmath86 . instead of the gross neveu model , it will turn out to be easier to study the equivalent of the sigma model , because of its relation with the @xmath88 toda theory and spin chain .",
    "the solution of the graded yang baxter equation relevant here is the well known @xmath86 one , given by @xmath89\\ ] ] where we have chosen the normalization factor for later purposes , @xmath45 is the identity .",
    "denote the basis vectors in the fundamental representation of @xmath86 as @xmath90 . the operator @xmath41 is given by the matrix @xmath91 in the subspace spanned by @xmath92 in that order , @xmath93 otherwise .",
    "in that same subspace , the graded permutation operator reads @xmath94 the operators @xmath95 satisfy the defining relations of the birman wenzl algebra with @xmath87 .",
    "the non graded @xmath73 matrix meanwhile reads @xmath96\\label{rosp}\\ ] ] let us now discuss the issue of unitarity .",
    "while @xmath97 , @xmath69 , @xmath73 , and @xmath98 as matrices , are unitary only with respect to an indefinite metric induced by the supergroup structure .",
    "explicitly , one has for instance @xmath99 and in fact @xmath73 conserves a scalar product that allows for negative norm square states @xmath100 , all others equal to @xmath101 .",
    "it is well known indeed @xcite that the structure of @xmath86 is not compatible with a positive scalar product .",
    "the mere presence of supergroup symmetry leads necessarily to the existence of negative norm - square states , and therefore to unitarity problems .",
    "the resulting scattering matrix is therefore non unitary , in the usual sense .",
    "this is a consequence of the orthosymplectic supergroup symmetry , and originates physically in the non unitarity of the field theory described by the @xmath7 matrix .",
    "this does not prevent one from using the @xmath7 matrix at least to describe the monodromy of the wave functions , as we will do in the section devoted to tba .",
    "similarly , this @xmath7 matrix could also be used to describe aspects of the finite size spectrum @xcite .",
    "an intriguing remark is that , although the matrix @xmath98 is not unitary , its eigenvalues happen to be complex numbers of modulus one ( the same hold for @xmath69 and @xmath73 ) , and there are reasons to believe that this is true for the eigenvalues of the monodromy matrices involving an arbitrary number of particles .",
    "this means that the non unitarity situation is not as stringent as say in the @xmath102 case @xcite , and that , for instance , the spectrum of the theory in finite size will be real .",
    "let us now consider the ` scattering ' theory that is the continuation of the sphere sigma model to @xmath87 : we take the @xmath86 realization , and as a prefactor @xmath17 .",
    "it then turns out that the @xmath7 matrix is identical to the one of the @xmath88 toda theory for a particular value of the coupling constant !",
    "this will allow us to explicitly perform the tba , and identify the scattering theory indeed . while we were carrying out these calculations , we found out two papers where the idea has been carried out to some extent already : one by martins @xcite , and one by sakai and tsuboi @xcite .",
    "our approach has little overlap with these papers , and stems from our earlier work on the @xmath102 theory instead .",
    "to proceed , we now discuss the @xmath88 toda theory in more details .",

    "the domain we shall be interested in primarily corresponds to @xmath109 .",
    "we will parameterize @xmath110 so @xmath111 , @xmath107=l^{-2/t}$ ] .",
    "the case @xmath112 corresponds to @xmath113 , and the limit @xmath114 to @xmath115 .",
    "the massless or massive nature of the theory depends on the sign of @xmath106 and on the value of @xmath116 @xcite . for @xmath117 ,",
    "the theory is massive for @xmath118 , but for the region we are interested in , @xmath119 is required , and we will restrict to this in the following .    in the @xmath120 $ ] domain , the scattering matrix has been first conjectured by smirnov @xcite .",
    "the spectrum does not contain any bound states , and is simply made of solitons with topological charges @xmath121 ( where the topological charge is defined as @xmath122 ) .",
    "the relation between the mass of the solitons and the coupling constant reads @xcite @xmath123^{3(2-\\beta^2)}\\ ] ] near @xmath124 , which will turn out to be the point with @xmath86 symmetry , setting @xmath125 , one has @xmath126 .",
    "the @xmath60 matrix is proportional to the @xmath73 matrix of the izergin korepin model @xcite .",
    "although this may seem laborious , we will write it explicitly here . introducing the parameter @xmath127 and the variables @xmath128 , @xmath129 , we write @xmath130 with @xcite @xmath131 the normalization factor admits the representation @xmath132\\ ] ] it is equal to the amplitude for the scattering processes @xmath133 .    in the case @xmath134 ,",
    "one checks that @xmath135 ( with @xmath136 , @xmath137 ) up to an irrelevant gauge transformation .",
    "moreover , it turns out that @xmath138 or @xmath139 for @xmath87 , confirming the identification of the @xmath88 @xmath60 matrix in the limit @xmath140 with the @xmath86 `` sphere sigma - model '' @xmath60 matrix .",
    "this coincidence has a simple algebraic origin .",
    "indeed recall @xcite , that the @xmath88 toda theory has symmetry @xmath141 , @xmath142 .",
    "the dynkin diagram for the algebra @xmath88 turns out to be almost identical to the one for the algebra @xmath143 @xcite , as represented in figure 4 , although in the latter case , one of the roots is fermionic , and therefore the basic relations involve an anticommutator instead of a commutator .",
    "= 4.0 in    it can be hoped that for some particular value of @xmath144 , the @xmath144-deformation of one algebra gives rise to the other , and this is what we shall now demonstrate - namely that there is a mapping between @xmath141 and @xmath145 , for @xmath146 .",
    "this should not come as a surprise , and has algebraic roots going back as far as @xcite .",
    "for recent related works , see @xcite .",
    "we conclude that , restricting to representations with @xmath166 even , the two algebras are isomorphic . since this constraint is satisfied in the case at hand , the @xmath171 symmetry of the @xmath88 toda theory is thus explained .      throughout this paper",
    ", we will use the thermodynamic bethe ansatz to calculate physical properties of our theory .",
    "it is a priori unclear whether the method - which involves maximizing a free energy - makes much sense in a theory whose hamiltonian is not hermitian , but the results we obtain seem perfectly meaningful , like in other similar examples .",
    "two additional remarks about the tba are relevant .",
    "first , the scattering matrix appearing in the auxiliary monodromy problem ( diagonalizing the matrix describing the effect of passing a particle through the others ) is not @xmath7 but @xmath77 .",
    "this means that , although the s matrices of the @xmath172 and @xmath88 differ because of the grading , the objects used in the tba ( like the @xmath77 matrices ) are identical , and known results about @xmath88 toda theories can be used .",
    "second , one may worry that mixing bosons and fermions could give rise to problems in applying the tba .",
    "this is not quite so however .",
    "most tba s known so far - and the ones we will introduce here will be no exceptions - allow at most one particle in a state of a given rapidity . as discussed in zamolodchikov @xcite ,",
    "this corresponds , in the diagonal case , to having @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the fermion number of particle @xmath175 . in our case",

    "the required result holds .",
    "the tba analysis can be performed using the well known strategies .",
    "the only difficulty is the diagonalization of the monodromy matrix , which involves solving an auxiliary problem based on the @xmath88 vertex model .",
    "string solutions for this model were not known before , but they can easily be obtained using our recent results on the @xmath102 case . setting @xmath180 ,",
    "the @xmath88 bethe equations have the form @xmath181 where the @xmath182 are bethe roots , and the @xmath183 are spectral parameter heterogeneities ( corresponding to the rapidities of particles already present in the system ) .",
    "the solutions of these equations in the thermodynamic limit are as follows .",
    "the @xmath184 s can be @xmath185 strings , or antistrings .",

    "remarkably , it is the ground state of the gross neveu model that has a leading @xmath496 dependence , while the ground state of the sigma model has a leading pure @xmath497 dependence : the roles of gross neveu and sigma model are therefore switched compared to the usual @xmath2 situation .    the calculation with a coupling to the first kind of charge ( [ firstk ] ) for",
    "@xmath293 or the second type of charge ( [ seck ] ) for @xmath334 poses difficulties , as the kernel does not factorize in the usual way then , so the wiener hopf method does not seem applicable .",

    "the ratios we found are thus the analytic continuations to @xmath499 , as desired models does not spoil this conclusion , as the beta functions are only trivially affected by the twists . ] .",
    "to conclude , although more verifications ought to be carried out to complete our identifications , we believe we have determined the scattering matrices for the massive regimes of the @xmath1 gn and the @xmath0 sigma models in the simple case @xmath336 , based on algebraic considerations as well as thermodynamic bethe ansatz calculations .    it is tempting to expect that at least some of our results generalize to other cases @xmath1 for @xmath500 and @xmath293 . in all these cases",
    ", we expect that the s matrix of the sphere sigma model will be obtained from the conjecture at the beginning of this paper , with @xmath49 , for @xmath325 .",
    "the s matrix of the gn model is probably more complicated .",
    "recall that in the case @xmath501 , it is given by the general conjecture only for @xmath24 .",
    "when @xmath502 , we think it is probably given by the conjecture only for @xmath503 .",
    "observe now that for the usual @xmath2 case , the factors @xmath17 and @xmath22 do not exhibit poles and are equal for @xmath25 . for these values ,",
    "the ( unique ) s matrix based on the general conjecture ( [ maini ] ) describes correctly the sigma model . as for the gross neveu model ,",
    "its description is more subtle : it turns out that the vector particles are actually unstable , and that the spectrum is made of kinks only .    in the case @xmath325 of interest here , the factors @xmath17 and @xmath22 similarly do not exhibit poles and are equal for @xmath504 .",
    "these cases would correspond for instance to @xmath505 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "it is very likely that there again , the s matrices describe the sigma model , and not the gross neveu model , for which the proper particle content has still to be identified .",
    "the @xmath3 case is particularly intriguing .",
    "the @xmath506 sphere can be parameterized by @xmath507 the action of the sigma model now reads @xmath508\\ ] ] where @xmath509 is compactified , @xmath510 .",
    "a rescaling and a relabeling brings it into the form @xmath511\\ ] ] with now @xmath512 .",
    "we see in particular that in the limit @xmath417 , the action is simply the one of a free uncompactified boson and a free fermion , of total central charge @xmath406 , and that the boson has a _ negative _ coupling : this system therefore coincides with the standard `` bosonization '' of the @xmath513 system in the limit @xmath514 !",
    "notice that as soon as @xmath500 , the negative sign of the bosons coupling for @xmath1 sigma models will have to be handled carefully ; presumably the @xmath3 , @xmath85 example will provide a good example of how to do this .",
    "finally , we discuss the boundary value @xmath515 , which exhibits some exceptional features . indeed , from the integrable point of view , the solution of the yang baxter equation ( combined with crossing and unitarity ) based on the generic s matrix is not unique for @xmath515 ( in contrast with the other values of @xmath12 ) but admits one continuous parameter @xmath398 .",
    "this solution is close to the sine - gordon solution , and is related to it by @xmath516 where @xmath517 are the usual sine gordon amplitudes @xmath518 and @xmath519 is given e.g. in @xcite .    in the case of @xmath520 , the existence of this parameter corresponds to the fact that the @xmath521 sigma model , or the @xmath520 gn model are actually massless critical theories , the coupling @xmath335 being exactly marginal .",
    "the s matrices then provide a massless description of these theories .",
    "since @xmath522 , the @xmath521 sigma model and the @xmath520 gn model coincide ; their identity follows from bosonization of the massless thirring model into the gaussian model .",
    "the free parameter in the s matrices is related with the coupling constant in either version of the model .",
    "( note that the s matrices can also be used to describe some massive perturbations .",
    "these , however , give rise to different type of models than the ones we are interested in , like the massive thirring model . )",
    "it seems very likely that similar things occur for @xmath523 models as well .",
    "the identity of the sigma model and the gn model in that case is not obvious , but one can at least check using our general formulas that the central charge and the effective central charge do match , @xmath524 , @xmath244 .",
    "there are on the other hand strong arguments showing that the beta function is exactly zero @xcite , so these models should have a line of fixed points indeed @xcite , in agreement with the s matrix prediction .",
    "besides completing the identifications we have sketched here , the most pressing questions that come to mind are : what are the @xmath7 matrices of the gross neveu models for non generic values of @xmath12 , what are the @xmath7 matrices for the multiflavour gn models , what are the @xmath7 matrices for the orthosymplectic principal chiral models ?",
    "we hope to report some answers to these questions soon . as a final related remark ,",
    "recall @xcite that there is an embedding in this formula stems from our conventions ; it would be @xmath67 if it were defined with respect to the sub @xmath357 . ]",
    "@xmath525 and that the branching functions of the latter part define a virasoro minimal model , with @xmath526 for @xmath67 an integer , the situation is especially interesting . the virasoro models which appear there have @xmath527 ; they are non unitary , and their effective central charge is @xmath528 .",
    "these models can thus be considered as @xmath529 coset models .",
    "their perturbation by the operator @xmath237 with dimension @xmath530 coincides with the rsos models defined in section 3 as truncations of the @xmath88 theories with @xmath531 .",
    "we thus see that the supersphere sigma model appears as the limit @xmath532 of a series of coset models @xcite , just like the ordinary sphere sigma model say appears as the limit of a series of parafermion theories , this time of @xmath533 type .",
    "there are many other interesting aspects of @xmath50 coset models in relation with the present paper which we also plan to discuss elsewhere .",
