    "the multiplicity and the distribution of lepton pairs produced in the coulomb fields of two colliding relativistic heavy ions are closely connected to the problem of unitarity .",
    "when heavy ions collide at relativistic velocities their lorentz contracted electromagnetic fields are sufficiently intense to produce a large numbers of such pairs .",
    "usually the process of lepton pairs production is considered as pair creation in the classic coulomb potential of a charge moving along a straight line .",
    "such an approach allows one @xcite to investigate the impact parameter dependent total probability of the pair creation @xmath6 , which by definition is connected with the total cross section @xmath7 . as was noticed in @xcite the probability of single pair production calculated to lowest order in fine structure constant @xmath8 ( throughout we use units for which @xmath9 ) at small impact parameters exceeds one , thus violating unitarity .",
    "this excess begins at impact parameters smaller than the compton wavelength of the electron @xmath10fm and at energies of practical interest ( rhic & lhc ) .",
    "allowance for the finite size of colliding nuclei does nt remedy the situation , because that would affect only the impact parameters comparable to t0he nuclei radii , which are much smaller than the compton wavelength of the electron @xmath11 .    as was shown in @xcite this problem",
    "can be solved by taking into account the possibility of multiple pair production , whose relative contribution grows with energy and dominates at small impact parameters . since this early publication there has been much work has in this direction ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) with the common for all statement : the probability to produce n lepton pairs in the coulomb field of heavy ions colliding at fixed impact parameter @xmath12 can be approximately represented as a poisson distribution i.e. @xmath13 , where w(b ) is the average multiplicity of pairs at a fixed impact parameter .",
    "because of the somewhat controversial situation in the subject and its importance for the operation of relativistic heavy ion colliders ( rhic & lhc ) , in the present communication we revisit the multiple pair production based on the powerful sudakov technique of calculation of high energy feynman diagrams .",
    "recently it has been applied @xcite to the calculation of coulomb corrections to single lepton pair production in relativistic heavy ion collisions . here",
    "we extend the sudakov approach to get the probability of multiple pair ( @xmath14 ) production in relativistic heavy ions collisions .",
    "for heavy ions with charge the numbers satisfy the conditions @xmath15 , @xmath16 , one needs full allowance of multiple coulomb interaction of colliding nuclei , whereas the secondary interaction of produced pairs ( real or virtual ) with the coulomb fields of colliding ions can be neglected .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we introduce the necessary definitions and discussed briefly the sudakovderivation of the born amplitude for single pair creation .",
    "then we show how one can sum the perturbative series to get the amplitude for the process of @xmath1 pairs production in a compact analytical form .    in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we consider the coulomb interaction between the colliding ions and show how it affects the amplitude and cross section of the process under consideration .",
    "apart from the conventional multiple photon exchange between ions , this interaction include also the so called `` screening corrections '' which are the result of the ions interaction through the virtual lepton pairs and are responsible for the probability of vacuum  to  vacuum transition . in the language of the abramovski ",
    "kancheli unitarity rules @xcite , the diagrams with lepton pair loops can be associated with the qed model for the pomeron , and the n - pair production amplitudes can be associated with the unitarity cuts through n exchanged pomerons . in section  [ sec:4 ]",
    "we report the multiple production amplitudes in the impact representation in which the summation of the perturbation series for the n - pair production can be done in a compact closed form .",
    "finally , using this amplitude we obtain the probability of @xmath1 pair production which can be cast in the poisson form , and the total cross section of all pair production process .",

    ", we will multiply the relevant amplitude by the factor @xmath23 .",
    "as was mentioned above we restrict ourselves to ions with charge numbers such that @xmath24 which permits us to omit the multiphoton exchanges between the produced pairs and colliding ions .",
    "the dominant mechanism is a production of a single lepton pair per collision of equivalent photons , i.e. , one lepton loop per two - photon ladder .",
    "the alternative mechanism of multiple pair production per collision of equivalent photons , i.e. , multiple lepton loops per two - photon ladder , is suppressed by inverse powers of @xmath25 .    for the description of a peripheral process of n lepton pairs creation",
    "i.e. the process @xmath26 it is convenient to use the sudakov parameterization for the four - momentum of all exchanged photons ( for details see @xcite ) @xmath27 here @xmath28 are light - like four - vectors build from @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the masses of colliding nuclei , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the electron mass and the total center mass energy .",
    "the denominators of intermediate states of the nucleon green functions for upper and lower blocks are the same and have the following form @xmath33    peripheral process is characterized by small values of longitudinal sudakov parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 and the transverse momenta of the order of electron mass @xmath36 it is easy to show that for the typical conversion of the nuclei currents @xmath37 only one term , which contains the scalar products of a nucleus current with a four  momentum of another nucleus , becomes relevant ( with power accuracy ) @xmath38 it can be seen that the quantity @xmath39 remains finite with the large values of @xmath32 .",
    "this fact provides great simplification of the spinor structure of the amplitude @xmath40 besides we have @xmath41 for the nuclei with the spin 1/2 and @xmath42 for the scalar one . using the identity @xmath43",

    "the amplitude of the process ( 1 ) in its lowest order ( born approximation ) reads @xcite @xmath48 @xmath49 is the compton tensor @xcite for pair creation by two virtual photons with polarization vectors @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 are the 4momenta of exchange photons and @xmath53 .",
    "strictly speaking the squares of these 4vectors @xmath54 do not vanish in the limit @xmath55 .",
    "this fact becomes essential when one calculates the total cross section of a single pair production process .",
    "for the case of two or more pairs production ( which is our case ) the replacement @xmath56 can safely be done .    using the gauge invariance @xmath57",
    "one can perform the replacement @xmath58 the quantity @xmath59 is related to the square of the invariant mass of a pair @xmath60 two - dimensional vectors @xmath61 can be interpreted as a polarization vectors of exchanged virtual photons .    using ( [ eq:13]-[eq:15 ] ) one can rewrite the born amplitude ( [ eq:12 ] ) in a form    @xmath62    now we are able to construct the amplitude for the process of @xmath1 pairs production . bearing in mind the expressions ( [ eq:11 ] ) the matrix element of two pairs production can be represented as the convolution of two born terms from expression ( [ eq:16b ] ) @xmath63 a straightforward generalization to the matrix element in the case of @xmath1 pairs production reads @xmath64 thus one can see that the amplitude for multiple pair production is solely determined by the convolution of the amplitudes corresponding to single pair production .    in the language of the agk unitarity rules , this result can be interpreted as unitarity cut through all exchanged pomerons .",
    "let us now consider the effect of @xmath31 photon exchanges between nuclei @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the arguments given above leads to the following matrix element for the process of @xmath1 pairs production with m photons exchanges among the colliding ions @xmath65    another effect which we take into account is the possibility of the ion ",
    "ion interaction through the lbl blocks ( screening effect in fig .  1 ) , which in the agk language @xcite is equivalent to the exchange by additional un  cut pomerons .",
    "it is associated with the iteration of a typical kernel    @xmath66    where we rearrange the `` extra '' phase volume of longitudinal sudakov parameters @xmath67 , @xmath68 in terms of invariant mass square of lbl block and extract explicitly the boost degree of freedom of lbl block        @xmath69    the structure ( 20 ) entered the matrix element ( 19 ) in the compact form @xmath70    real part of ( [ eq:20c ] ) ( equal to one half of its s  channel discontinuity ) is related with ( [ eq:16b ] ) @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the phase volume of the intermediate pair @xmath73 we will show later that the imaginary part of @xmath74 is irrelevant either for the total cross section or for the probability of @xmath1 pairs production distribution .",
    "the last step in building the matrix element for the process of @xmath1 real pairs creation consist in transformation of the obtained above expressions in the impact  parameter representation and summation over all eikonal photons and lbl blocks . for this",
