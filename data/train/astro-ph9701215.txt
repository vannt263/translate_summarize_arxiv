    "<S> mica can store ( for @xmath0 gy ) etchable tracks caused by atoms recoiling from wimps . because a background from fission neutrons will eventually limit this technique , a unique signature for wimps in ancient mica </S>",
    "<S> is needed . </S>",
    "<S> our motion around the center of the galaxy causes wimps , unlike neutrons , to enter the mica from a preferred direction on the sky . </S>",
    "<S> mica is a directional detector and despite the complex rotations that natural mica crystals make with respect to this wimp `` wind , '' there is a substantial dependence of etch pit density on present day mica orientation .    </S>",
    "<S> # 1[#1 ] # 1\\{*#1 * }    decades of research have established that at least 90% of the mass of our universe is not emitting any light @xcite . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> the nature of this dark matter has come under considerable experimental and theoretical scrutiny . as a result of this scrutiny </S>",
    "<S> the list of potential candidates has dwindled from dozens a decade ago to only a few today @xcite . among the surviving candidates </S>",
    "<S> is the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) . from a theoretical standpoint wimps </S>",
    "<S> enjoy a great deal of support . </S>",
    "<S> they fit well into our understanding of structure formation in the universe @xcite and into many supersymmetric theories of particle physics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> because of this theoretical support an increasing number of experimentalists employing a variety of techniques have set out to find these particles . </S>",
    "<S> one such technique consists of looking for evidence of recoils from wimps in ancient mica@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this technique exploits the fact that atoms recoiling from interactions with wimps ( `` wimp recoils '' ) would produce permanent chemical changes in the mica which later would produce etch pits when immersed in hydrofluoric acid . </S>",
    "<S> stringent limits on wimp cross sections as a function of mass were obtained @xcite by scanning only a small area , due to the fact that ancient mica integrates this signal for order 1 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately other particles , e.g. fission neutrons , can also cause recoils which produce etch pits very similar to the etch pits we expect from wimp recoils . </S>",
    "<S> eventually this background will limit the technique and ultimately preclude the possibility of actually discovering wimps using this method . </S>",
    "<S> a signature for wimps is needed . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we discuss a possible signature and calculate its magnitude .    </S>",
    "<S> the signature arises from the fact that our motion around the center of the galaxy through a stationary wimp halo causes a wimp `` wind '' to arrive at earth preferentially from one direction , the so - called ram direction . </S>",
    "<S> the ancient mica technique can exploit this asymmetry because the mica is itself asymmetric . </S>",
    "<S> mica is a layered crystalline mineral which is easily cleaved along the @xmath1 crystallographic plane . in order to distinguish </S>",
    "<S> wimp recoils from the large population of etch pits produced by alpha - decay in the @xmath2u and @xmath3th decay chains , we require recoils to cross the cleavage plane @xcite . in order to quantify the asymetry of the mica we define ,    @xmath4    to be the signal contrast where n is the number of matched etched pits created by wimp recoils and the subscripts , min and max , refer to the maximum and minimum of n over all possible mica orientations . </S>",
    "<S> the signal contrast is the maximum assymetry possible .    to determine the magnitude of this parameter for a wimp halo , we performed the following calculation . </S>",
    "<S> starting with the recoil spectrum@xcite , energy and angle with respect to the ram direction @xmath5 , and using @xmath6 and @xmath7 with a cutoff at @xmath8 , we randomly generated recoils of the constituent atoms of mica . </S>",
    "<S> ranges and stopping powers of the recoils were calculated with the trim92 computer code @xcite . as discussed by snowden - ifft and chan @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> not every ion which crosses the cleavage plane produces an etch pit . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of an etch pit is determined by a stochastic process which depends on the type of stopping power ( nuclear or electronic , characterized by two constants @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) , the magnitude of the stopping power and the angle the recoil makes with the @xmath1 plane . </S>",
    "<S> the angular dependence of the etching model has been well tested @xcite and it is found that ions normally incident on the cleavage plane are less likely to create an etch pit than those crossing at grazing angles . </S>",
    "<S> each recoil that crossed the cleavage plane was etched according to this etching model @xcite with @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 nm . </S>",
    "<S> a coherence term @xcite was included in the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure was carried out for a variety of wimp masses @xmath14 at a variety of angles @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the rate of accumulation of matched etched pits with depths of 2 nm or greater can be adequately characterized by    @xmath15    @xmath16 was positive for all wimp masses considered , so mica oriented at @xmath17 has a higher rate of accumulation than mica oriented at @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> two pieces of mica constantly held at @xmath17 and @xmath18 will therefore have the largest possible signal contrast , @xmath19 , given by    @xmath20    in table [ table1 ] we show @xmath19 for several values of wimp mass . </S>",
    "<S> the lower the mass of the wimp the larger @xmath19 although for very low mass wimps the expected density decreases rapidly .    </S>",
    "<S> no piece of mica has pointed in the same direction over geologic time , so to compute the wimp track density as a function of contemporary orientation and age we require a detailed history of an ancient mica s orientation with respect to the ram direction . </S>",
    "<S> this history is complex , but quantifiable . </S>",
    "<S> several rotations contribute to it ; we discuss each below in order of increasing timescale . </S>",
    "<S> the diurnal rotation of the vector normal to the @xmath1 mica plane , the mica normal vector , about the celestial pole has the shortest timescale : 24 hours . over timescales much larger than this </S>",
    "<S> the track density will be a function only of the declination of the mica normal vector , or the _ mica normal declination_. we assume that the interaction length of wimps is much larger than the radius of the earth . </S>",
    "<S> the motion of the celestial pole with respect to the ecliptic pole is comprised of two general rotations : nutation and precession . </S>",
    "<S> nutation has an amplitude of less than 10 arcseconds@xcite , so can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> precession is the smooth rotation of the celestial pole about the ecliptic pole with fixed angle  </S>",
    "<S> the obliquity  between the two . </S>",
    "<S> the obliquities of most of the inner planets have undergone large and chaotic changes on timescales of order 1 - 10 my @xcite since solar system formation , with excursions from @xmath21 to @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , both for this calculation and for the climatic stability of the earth , the presence of the moon has had a dramatic stabilizing effect , so that the earth s obliquity has varied from its mean value of @xmath23 by only @xmath24 since the moon was captured@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the slow orbital motion of the solar system around the center of the galaxy has the longest timescale of the celestial rotations . </S>",
    "<S> this motion has the effect of slowly rotating the ram direction within the galactic plane . </S>",
    "<S> we assumed that the solar system describes a circular orbit about the galactic center , with a velocity of 220 km sec@xmath25@xcite and a period of 224 my@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to these celestial rotations , tectonic drift , with a timescale between 10 - 100 my , also affects a mica crystal s orientation with respect to the ram direction . </S>",
    "<S> it is not necessary to know the absolute longitude of the body , but a history of the latitude and orientation of the body is required . </S>",
    "<S> paleomagnetic data directly provide this history . in a simplified description of the technique , </S>",
    "<S> the direction of the terrestrial magnetic field is recorded by the magnetization direction of a magnetic mineral as it cools below the so called `` blocking '' temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the local magnetic field direction at that time can thus be determined by a careful measurement of the magnetization direction of the mineral , and this determines the position of the terrestrial magnetic pole with respect to the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the age of the mineral is typically derived from the fossil record in the same stratum as the mineral for phanerozoic ( younger than 590 my ) samples , and by radioisotope or fission - track dating for pre - cambrian ( older than 590 my ) samples . in practice , there are many complications , but the technique is well - developed , and the position for an ancient magnetic pole can be determined with an accuracy of @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the determination of a mean paleomagnetic pole is equivalent to a determination of the geographic pole position relative to the sample@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy between the mean paleomagnetic pole and the modern geographic pole is attributed to tectonic drift , yielding the latitude and orientation of the body containing the sample .    </S>",
    "<S> a large body of time sequences of paleomagnetic pole measurements  generally known as apparent polar wander paths ( apwps )  have been compiled by several authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) with the general goal of the reconstruction of ancient geography . </S>",
    "<S> this dataset is ideal for our purposes . </S>",
    "<S> the best - determined apwps have been done for the major continental cratons ( bodies which have been geologically stable and have undergone only rigid - body rotations over long geological times ) . for each craton , we arbitrarily choose a point near the geographic center of the craton for the purpose of calculation . as a general statement , </S>",
    "<S> the reconstruction of apwps is best for phanerozoic time because the fossil record allows for accurate dating ; for pre - cambrian times apwps are in general rather poorly known , although the situation is improving rapidly particularly for the north american and european continents ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we briefly summarize here the method used for signal integration . the track density for a piece of mica of age @xmath27 , zenith angle @xmath28 and azimuth angle @xmath29 ( true north corresponding to @xmath30 , true east to @xmath31 , etc . ) </S>",
    "<S> can be calculated from eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ n - eqn ] to be    @xmath32 t , \\label{n - integrated}\\ ] ]    where @xmath33 is the average value of @xmath34 over the age of the mica sample . for a given wimp mass and mica age </S>",
    "<S> this function will achieve a maximum value , @xmath35 , in an orientation specified by @xmath36 and @xmath37 and a minimum value , @xmath38 , for some other orientation specified by @xmath39 and @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> combining eqs . </S>",
    "<S> [ s - first ] and [ n - integrated ] with the fact that @xmath41 allows us to factor @xmath42 and write it as    @xmath43    where @xmath44 ( eq . [ smax - eqn ] ) characterizes the asymmetry of the mica response and is independent of time , and    @xmath45    characterizes the mica s history and is independent of mass .    the track density integrated over timescales longer than the precessional timescale ( @xmath46 y ) but shorter than the timescale for tectonic drift and galactic rotation ( @xmath47 my ) is a function only of mica normal declination @xmath48 and of the ecliptic declination of the ram direction @xmath49 , since rapid diurnal rotation and polar precession have the effect of averaging over celestial right ascension and ecliptic longitude . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ contour ] , we show @xmath50 , the calculated average of @xmath34 over these intermediate timescales as a function of mica normal declination and ram ecliptic declination .    to calculate @xmath51 over geologic timescales , we first determine the ram ecliptic declination @xmath52 for a given short geological time interval @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> we then determine the continental latitude and orientation using an linear interpolation on the sphere between the two paleomagnetic pole measurements closest in time to @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the ancient values of mica normal declination @xmath55 are determined for each contemporary mica sample orientation ( @xmath28,@xmath29 ) , using the paleomagnetically determined rotations from the current position . </S>",
    "<S> symbolically , the functional dependence of the calculations is summarized by :    @xmath56.\\ ] ]    @xmath57 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> 6 may then be calculated using eq . </S>",
    "<S> 7 . </S>",
    "<S> although much of this integration can be in principle be done analytically , tectonic drift requires that the calculation be done numerically .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ xifigure ] , we show @xmath57 as a function of mica age for several major continental cratons . for this calculation , we used time intervals of 5 my , a @xmath58 grid of diurnal and precessional rotations , and a @xmath58 grid of mica orientations . </S>",
    "<S> because of the symmetry of the mica  mica orientation is defined only up to a parity transformation  it is only necessary to define the signal over the upper hemisphere , ( @xmath59 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the periodicity due to galactic rotation is clearly visible . </S>",
    "<S> it is desirable to choose locations and ages for which @xmath60 is large and , because of uncertainties in measuring the age of the mica , for which the signal amplitude and direction are not changing rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> we intend to address in a future paper the effect of the uncertainties in our calculation , including the uncertainty in the length of the galactic year ( @xmath61 ) , the effect of uncertainties in mica ages , and so on . </S>",
    "<S> for old mica the signal is smaller but the integration time is longer and for a given area of mica scanned the statistical significance of an observed signal turns out to be roughly independent of age . </S>",
    "<S> the signal contrast for 50 gev wimps ( @xmath62% ) in mica 500 my old ( @xmath63% ) is of order one percent ( @xmath64% ) . </S>",
    "<S> this signal contrast is small but it is `` state - of - the - art . '' </S>",
    "<S> no wimp limits have been published with detectors having a substantially larger signal contrast .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we need to address the feasibility of such an experiment . </S>",
    "<S> first in order to utilize this idea we will need to obtain several pieces of mica oriented in the proper directions . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately the large nearly perfect crystals required of such a search are almost always found in coarse grained rock formations known as pegmatites . </S>",
    "<S> a typical pegmatite will contain many large mica crystals oriented in random directions@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of these structures virtually guarantees that we will be able to obtain mica of the proper quality having the same composition and same history and oriented in nearly the optimal directions . </S>",
    "<S> large concentrations of uranium in the pegmatite will need to be surveyed as the fast neutrons that emanate from them could potentially mimic our signal . </S>",
    "<S> the second issue is the difficulty of detecting a @xmath64% signal . if wimps exist at cross - sections just below our current limits we estimate that it will take a @xmath65 improvement in scanned area to see a signal at the 3@xmath66 level . with an automated afm an area equivalent to that of our first mica search can be scanned in a little less than 4 hours . </S>",
    "<S> an additional factor of 3 is gained by etching for twice as long . as mentioned above the appearance of an etch pit </S>",
    "<S> is governed by a stochastic process . as shown in @xcite , a longer etching time results in more opportunities for an etch pit to form . </S>",
    "<S> this effect has been confirmed experimentally@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath65 improvement can therefore be achieved in about 6 years of machine time . as discussed in [ 6 ] large crystals of mica </S>",
    "<S> will allow us to achieve this improvement without running into neutron background . </S>",
    "<S> if a signal is observed it can be confirmed by similar experiments on other pegmatites .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by first stressing the two main points of this letter . because of the asymmetries inherent in etching latent tracks in ancient mica our detector can sense the direction of the wimp `` wind . '' </S>",
    "<S> moreover despite the complex rotations that mica crystals makes with respect to this wimp `` wind , '' there is a substantial dependence of etch pit density on present day mica orientation . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence can be used as a signature for wimps which in turn will allow us to detect wimps if they exist or rule them out more efficiently if they do not . </S>"
