    "even though wave mechanics does not emcompass the concept of trajectory , this classical notion often appears in the quantum formalism . on a fundamental level , there are trajectory - based theories like path - integrals @xcite and bohmian mechanics @xcite that aim to provide interpretations and quantitative rules to deal with general quantum systems . within the orthodox structure of wave mechanics we have the ehrenfest theorem , which establishes the phase - space paths followed by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , providing an important , but deceptive , connection with classical mechanics .",
    "an illustration of the continuing interest in the conceptual / experimental status of trajectories in quantum mechanics is a recent implementation of appropriate combinations of strong and weak measurements to determine average paths of single photons in a two - slit interferometer @xcite .",
    "the whole of semiclassics is based on newtonian paths , the goal being to express quantum mechanical quantities in terms of real @xcite or complex @xcite classical trajectories and their stability properties .",
    "these approximations are extensively used , e.g. , in physical chemistry and also in linking the distinct structures of classical and quantum mechanics , where a critical point is the understanding of the emergence of classical chaos from a linear theory . usually , in order to calculate semiclassical expressions @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    ", we first need an approximate solution to the time dependent schroedinger equation @xmath4 .",
    "the purpose of this manuscript is to provide a more direct connection between classical , semiclassical and quantum paths , and to discuss the fundamental differences between them .",
    "for example , how quantum non - locality shows up in the semiclassical trajectories ( and vanishes as @xmath5 ) .",
    "given a particle of mass @xmath6 subjected to a potential @xmath7 , the equations of motion for the expectation values of position and momentum in quantum mechanics , provided by the ehrenfest theorem , lead to @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 being an arbitrary solution of the time - dependent schroedinger equation .",
    "to simplify the notation we suppress the subscript @xmath11 hereafter .",
    "the formal similarity between the previous relation and newton s second law is quite misleading .",
    "this is partly due to the widely known fact that @xmath12 the two quantities in the above relation tend to coincide only in the limiting case of spatially localized wave functions .",
    "some authors refer to the fulfillment of this last condition along with eq .",
    "( [ ehrenf ] ) as the ehrenfest theorem @xcite .",
    "there is , however , another important difference .",
    "while in classical mechanics , @xmath13 is a second order differential equation , relation ( [ ehrenf ] ) is an _ identity _ , not an equation .",
    "once the quantum dynamics is resolved , @xmath10 can be used to calculate the quantities in ( [ ehrenf ] ) and to show that both sides of the equality invariably coincide . as a consequence ,",
    "if one resorts to any approximate method to get @xmath14 , relation ( [ ehrenf ] ) ceases to hold exactly . in this case",
    "the question arises , which side of ( [ ehrenf ] ) better describes the exact quantum evolution of the mean values ? in principle we are free to pick either @xmath15 as our trial approximate acceleration ( or a linear combination of them ) .",
    "in the present manuscript we will be concerned with semiclassical approximations @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 to the corresponding exact quantum expected values .",
    "therefore , our basic ingredients are the classical trajectory [ @xmath19 and @xmath20 and its stability properties given by the tangent matrix @xmath21 . consider the initial conditions @xmath22 leading , after a short time , to the phase - space point @xmath23 .",
    "if we take the neighboring initial point @xmath24 , one ends up at @xmath25 . in the linear approximation @xmath21",
    "is defined by @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are constant parameters , that will be conveniently set , with dimensions of position and momentum , respectively .    in the semiclassical domain it is natural to consider localized states , which uniformly tend to a classical point in phase space as @xmath5 .",
    "for this reason , a canonical coherent state is taken as our initial ket , the corresponding wave function being given by the minimum uncertainty gaussian packet @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a coherent state with @xmath31 . the position and momentum uncertainties are @xmath32 and @xmath33 , with @xmath34 .",
    "these relations also provide convenient scales @xmath27 and @xmath28 used in the definition of the stability matrix . in order to satisfy the minimum uncertainty relation we must have @xmath35 and @xmath36 for any @xmath37 .",
    "however , for @xmath38 , either @xmath39 or @xmath40 diverges as @xmath5 , leading to a non - physical infinite squeezing in the classical limit .",
    "thus , we assume from now on that @xmath41 so that the classical limit corresponds to a rescaling , the geometrical nature of the state remaining unchanged .",
    "finally , given the classical path and initial state , we choose the simplest semiclassical approximation to describe the time evolution of @xmath42 , namely , heller s  thawed gaussian \" @xcite : @xmath43}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the classical position and momentum as functions of time , @xmath46 is the classical action , and @xmath47 . due to its extreme simplicity",
    ", @xmath48 is a gaussian for all times and the heller wave function is usually a poor approximation to describe the quantum wave function for longer propagation times .",
    "therefore , our results will be valid only on a short - time scale .",
    "this limitation , however , will not prevent us to get useful information .      since the above formula is a gaussian for all times ,",
    "its use together with the first option in ( [ choice ] ) leads simply to @xmath49 . in this case",
    ", no vestige of the quantum behavior is left . on the contrary , if one employs ( [ heller ] ) and the second option in ( [ choice ] ) , the result is non - trivial .",
    "thus , we define the semiclassical acceleration as @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "this definition provides corrections to the bare classical trajectory because the gaussian extends over the space  sensing \" the different values taken by @xmath52 , i. e. , the whole force field .",
    "it is important to note that the potential can not be singular for any finite @xmath53 , since the gaussian is non - zero everywhere .",
    "we begin our analysis of ( [ asc ] ) in a very general way , by assuming that the potential is an arbitrary polynomial : @xmath54 in principle , @xmath55 is supposed to be finite , but we may take @xmath56 in cases where convergence of @xmath57 can be guaranteed . substituting the above relation in the general prescription ( [ asc ] ) we get @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "this leads to @xmath60^{n-1}{\\rm h}_{n-1}\\left[\\frac{iq_c(t)}{\\sigma(t)}\\right]\\;,\\ ] ] where h@xmath61 denotes the hermite polynomial of degree @xmath62 [ notice that @xmath63 is a real function ] and the time dependence was made explicit . by integration we get @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we recall that in order to get these approximations to the quantum expected values one has only to solve the classical equations for @xmath19 and the stability matrix @xmath21 , not the schroedinger equation .      as any consistent semiclassical approximation",
    ", @xmath57 must coincide with the classical and exact quantum values for gaussian packets in linear and harmonic potentials ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 ) .",
    "this is indeed the case . for @xmath64 , formula ( [ asc ] )",
    "gives immediately @xmath67 , while for @xmath68 , relation ( [ asc2 ] ) gives the constant acceleration @xmath69 . finally , for @xmath70",
    ", we get @xmath71 . setting @xmath72",
    "we obtain @xmath73 , as expected . for higher order potentials",
    "the classical , semiclassical , and quantum results no longer coincide .    before going into more quantitative examples , we establish the general lower order correction to the classical acceleration in the general case of an analytic potential . to do that we must realize that the planck constant appears in ( [ asc ] ) [ or ( [ asc2 ] ) ] implicitly , through @xmath74 . replacing @xmath75}_{k=0}(2y)^{n-2k}(-1)^k\\frac{n!}{k!(n-2k)!}\\ ] ] into ( [ asc2 ] ) and collecting the lower powers of @xmath76 we get @xmath77 this shows that our result is consistent with classical mechanics plus a main correction of order @xmath78 and smaller terms ( involving higher powers of @xmath79 and higher derivatives of @xmath7 ) .",
    "perhaps the most important point about the above relation is that these approximate quantum paths can not come from any effective or modified potential , because they are not hamiltonian .",
    "differently from what happens in classical mechanics , the instantaneous dynamics of a phase - space point depends upon higher order derivatives of the potential . this is a trace of quantum non - locality . while in the newtonian mechanics the particle only needs to  know \"",
    "its position [ to get @xmath80 and the force to which it is subjected ( @xmath81d@xmath82d@xmath53 ) , both local quantities , in the semiclassical case all derivatives of the potential are needed , which amounts to knowing the function @xmath7 for all values of @xmath53 , no matter its distance to the particle .",
    "any change in the potential in a far region instantly influences the semiclassical particle s path .",
    "of course , this non - locality vanishes as @xmath5 .",
    "note that the correction to the classical acceleration is , in general , non - vanishing even for @xmath83 .",
    "this can be understood by realizing that our expression yields , by construction , the exact quantum result as @xmath84 . for sufficiently short times",
    "the evolution operator can be written as @xmath85 , so that the expectation value of momentum is , to second order in @xmath86 @xmath87\\rangle_{z_0 } - \\frac{t^2}{4 \\mu}\\left\\langle \\left\\{\\hat{p } , \\frac{\\partial^2 \\hat{v}}{\\partial \\hat{q}^2}\\right\\ } \\right\\rangle_{z_0 } + o(t^3 ) \\\\",

    "we define the exact acceleration as @xmath89 which is @xmath57 for @xmath90 .",
    "this guarantees a consistent quantum - classical interplay in the sense that the semiclassical expression tends to become classical for @xmath5 while it is the exact quantum result for @xmath84 .",
    "this closes our discussion for short - time propagation in 1d analytic potentials . in the next section",
    "we illustrate the procedure by applying ( [ asc2 ] ) in the case of a cubic potential .",
    "in addition , we give an example involving a non - analytical potential , for which expression ( [ asc2 ] ) is not valid and ( [ asc ] ) must be used directly .",
    "here we consider in more detail the classical , semiclassical , and quantum accelerations in the particular case of a cubic potential @xmath91 .",

    "a crucial process in wave - packet dynamics is the collision with a potential wall .",
    "here we examine the evolution of @xmath106 for the gaussian packet ( [ gaussian packet ] ) bouncing off a step potential , @xmath107 for the cases where @xmath108 . from the classical trajectory , @xmath109 with @xmath110",
    ", we extract the two needed tangent matrix elements : @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",

    "we conclude that even for this discontinuous potential the semiclassical results are quite consistent for times shorter than the classical turning time .",
    "in particular , the tendency of the quantum turning point to recede is seen in the semiclassical plots .",
    "in fact , this effect may be artificially enhanced in our approximation because in the quantum dynamics the packet deforms such that its penetration into the barrier is smaller in comparison that of the semiclassical gaussian packet .",
    "the deformation is stronger for larger values of @xmath79 ( see the bottom plot ) .",
