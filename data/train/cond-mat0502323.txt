    "the study of the dynamics of classical heisenberg spins has long proved invaluable in a variety of physical contexts . from a mathematical point of view , spin clusters have been a natural testing ground to explore the emergence of chaos @xcite .",
    "the recent developments in the experimental study of magnetic molecules @xcite have generated a renewed interest in the dynamics of classical heisenberg spins .",
    "integral representations of the time - dependent spin - spin correlation functions have been presented for a variety of small integrable clusters @xcite .",
    "analogous results for the equivalent neighbor model or for an integrable deformation of it have also been obtained @xcite . among the more recent developments , in @xcite the neutron scattering structure factors for a wide range of finite quantum spin systems",
    "were computed analytically by haraldsen , barnes , and musfeldt .    in this letter",
    "we report on a broad classification of integrable cases . in section [ models ]",
    "we present a class of models leading to integrable equations of motion . in section [ solutions ] the integrability of the models",
    "is proved and the precession frequencies are obtained .",

    "the most general heisenberg hamiltonian for @xmath0 classical spins normalized according to @xmath1 , @xmath2 , is @xmath3 the matrix of exchange couplings @xmath4 $ ] in ( [ ham : gen ] ) is symmetric , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the time evolution of each spin is determined by the differential equations @xmath7 the structure of the equations of motion ( [ eom : gen ] ) explicitly shows that the norm of each spin is indeed constant .",
    "the equations ( [ eom : gen ] ) are non - linear and , for an arbitrary matrix of couplings @xmath8 $ ] , they do not admit a general solution in closed form . in the following",
    "we identify a class of coupling matrices for which the general solution can be explicitly constructed .",
    "let us partition the set @xmath9 of spin labels into nonintersecting subsets @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ,  , such that @xmath13 we are going to call the set of spins whose labels are in @xmath10 the ` spin cluster @xmath10 , ' and so on for every other subset of @xmath14 .",
    "it is useful to introduce also the following terminology .",
    "a coupling @xmath15 is called internal if its indices @xmath16 and @xmath17 belong to the same cluster , whereas a coupling @xmath15 is called external if @xmath16 and @xmath17 belong to different clusters",
    ".      moreover , we claim that if each of the coupling matrices @xmath21 , @xmath22 ,  , can in turn be written in the form ( [ red : matrix ] ) , with a single coupling @xmath25 among the sub - clusters of @xmath10 , a single coupling @xmath26 among the sub - clusters of @xmath11 , etc . , ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ,  , need not be equal to @xmath18 ) , and if this can be carried on until we get clusters containing only single spins , the equations of motion ( [ eom : gen ] ) can be solved exactly . as an example , an 8-spin model of this type",
    "is shown in figure 1 .",
    "we also notice that all the models studied in @xcite fit into this scheme .     and @xmath27 form a dimer with a coupling @xmath28 .",
    "spin @xmath29 is coupled to this dimer with a coupling @xmath30 to form an isosceles triangle .",
    "spins @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 form a tetrahedron with coupling @xmath35 .",
    "these individual clusters , together with the single spin @xmath36 , are coupled to one another by the external coupling @xmath37.,width=377 ]",
    "if the coupling matrix has the form ( [ red : matrix ] ) , the equation of motion for a spin belonging to cluster @xmath10 is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the sum of all the spins outside cluster @xmath10 .",
    "similar equations can be written for the spins in every other cluster @xmath11 , @xmath12 , etc .    with the definitions",
    "@xmath40 we obtain the equations of motion describing the time evolution of the spin sums ( [ spin : sums ] ) by adding the equations ( [ eom : reda ] ) for all spins in a given cluster .",
    "e.g. , for cluster @xmath10 we obtain @xmath41 since the total spin @xmath42 of the system can be written as @xmath43 equation ( [ a : sum ] ) becomes @xmath44    since the total spin @xmath42 is conserved in the heisenberg model , equation ( [ a : prec ] ) can be solved immediately .",
    "the solution describes the precession of the vector @xmath45 around @xmath42 . choosing a coordinate system such that @xmath46 , the solution can be written as @xmath47\\ ] ] where @xmath48",
    ", @xmath49 is the projection of @xmath50 along the direction of @xmath42 , @xmath51 is its projection perpendicular to the direction of @xmath42 , and @xmath52 is the initial phase of @xmath45 . since all the @xmath53 and @xmath54 are now explicitly known functions of time , solving equation ( [ eom : reda ] ) is reduced to solving the internal coupling sector for each cluster .",
    "indeed , let us focus again on cluster @xmath10 and let us assume that its index set @xmath10 can itself be partitioned in a way similar to ( [ part ] ) , i.e. , @xmath55 and that the coupling matrix @xmath21 has the structure ( [ red : matrix ] ) , with all external couplings between the sub - clusters @xmath56 , @xmath0 , @xmath57 , being equal to @xmath25 .",
    "the equations of motion involving the spins of sub - cluster @xmath56 can then be written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "once again , equations of the same form will hold for the spins in the other sub - clusters of @xmath10 .",
    "adding all the equations for the spins in sub - cluster @xmath56 in a way similar to the derivations of ( [ a : sum ] ) and ( [ a : prec ] ) , and defining @xmath60 , we obtain @xmath61 which can also be written in the form @xmath62 as long as we can apply the reduction scheme of section 2 to the next level of sub - clusters , this solving procedure can be carried on iteratively . for the purpose of illustration ,",
    "suppose that the internal couplings between the spins in sub - cluster @xmath56 are all equal to @xmath63 , i.e. , that the reduction procedure ends at this level .",
    "consist of individual spins , each coupled to all the others with coupling @xmath63 , or that @xmath56 is an equivalent neighbor model with respect to its internal couplings .",
    "] the equations of motion for the individual spins in cluster @xmath56 can then be written as @xmath64 in order to write the solution for @xmath65 in a closed form we apply successively the fourier transform method used in @xcite to find @xmath53 , then @xmath66 , and finally @xmath65 , @xmath67 .",
    "though cumbersome and tedious , this is straightforward and mechanical . for the purposes of this letter , we restrict ourselves to stating the resulting frequencies of the various spin precessions : @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 . figure 2 illustrates the precessions of the individual spins and the spin composites for the 8-spin model in figure 1 .    , the net spin of the tetrahedron , @xmath71 , and the individual spin @xmath36 precess with angular speed @xmath72 about the total spin of the system , @xmath42 .",
    "the individual spins @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 in turns precess about @xmath71 . the dimer spin @xmath73 and the individual spin @xmath29 precess about the isosceles spin @xmath74 . finally ,",
    "@xmath75 and @xmath27 precess about @xmath73.,width=377 ]    more generally , if the reduction scheme leads to a hierarchy of @xmath76 levels of sub - clusters , @xmath77 , where each @xmath78-level cluster has a coupling @xmath79 among its @xmath80-level sub - clusters , the time evolution of the @xmath81 spin @xmath82 can be found by iteratively solving the equations @xmath83 the fourier transformed version of the hierarchy of equations ( [ level : n ] ) is : @xmath84 where the symbol @xmath85 denotes a vector product in the real space and a convolution in the fourier space .",
    "although the explicit solution to the general case ( [ fourier - level : n ] ) would be too cumbersome to write in a closed form , it is easy to see that the first equation of ( [ fourier - level : n ] ) will lead to @xmath86 ( i.e. , @xmath87 or @xmath42 is constant ) . the second equation would introduce a new frequency in the fourier spectrum of @xmath88 : @xmath89 ( for instance , this gives the spin precession frequency for each of spins in a dimer@xcite ) .",
    "the third equation will give rise to the additional frequency @xmath90 in the fourier spectrum of @xmath91 ( as it happens for the individual spins on the sites of a squashed equivalent neighbor model @xcite . )",
    "we are therefore led to state that the solution for the individual spin @xmath82 will contain @xmath92-functions of various sums or differences of the frequencies @xmath68 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 ,  , @xmath95 or , in other words , the fourier spectrum of @xmath65 will contain only these frequencies .",
    "in this letter we have identified a class of integrable spin cluster models and have presented a procedure for obtaining the exact solutions for the time evolution of the individual spins , listing the frequencies that appear in their fourier spectra .",
    "we hope that these results and solving procedures will prove useful to anyone interested in easily identifying and solving specific classical heisenberg spin models relevant for describing the physical properties of magnetic molecules .",
