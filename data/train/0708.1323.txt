    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) are the descendants of low- and intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath38  m@xmath2 ) , the source of approximately half of the neutron(_n_)-capture element ( atomic number @xmath4 ) nuclei in the universe .",
    "these elements are created by slow _",
    "n_-capture nucleosynthesis ( the `` _ _ s__-process '' ) during the thermally - pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase , and",
    "are conveyed to the stellar envelope during third dredge - up ( tdu ) .",
    "free neutrons are released during the interpulse phase by @xmath5c(@xmath6)@xmath7o  or @xmath8ne(@xmath6)@xmath9 mg in more massive agb stars  and are captured by iron - peak `` seed '' nuclei , which undergo subsequent _ n_-captures and @xmath10-decays to transform into heavier elements @xcite .",
    "the enriched material is discharged into the ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) via stellar winds and , ultimately , pn ejection . at solar metallicity",
    ", tdu occurs in stars with initial masses @xmath11m@xmath2 ; in less massive stars , stellar winds reduce the mass of the stellar envelope below the critical mass for tdu ( 0.30.5  m@xmath2 ; @xcite ) before dredge - up can take place .",
    "hence , stars less massive than 1.5  m@xmath2 ( and their pne ) are not expected to exhibit _",
    "s_-process enrichments .    studying _",
    "s_-process enrichments in pne provides unique information that can not be obtained from spectroscopy of agb stars .",
    "for example , the lightest _ n_-capture elements ( @xmath1236 ) and noble gases generally can not be detected in agb stars , since strong lines of their neutrals and first ions reside in the uv where cool giant stars emit little flux .",
    "in addition , intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath13  m@xmath2 , hereafter ims ) are difficult to study during the agb , due to heavy extinction from their dusty , optically thick circumstellar envelopes . however , these objects are readily observable as type  i pne @xcite .    in this contribution",
    ", we present results from the first large - scale survey of _ n_-capture elements in galactic pne .",
    "we have determined the elemental abundances ( or upper limits ) of the _",
    "n_-capture elements se ( @xmath14 ) and kr ( @xmath15 ) in 120 pne , and examine correlations between _ s_-process enrichments and other nebular and stellar properties for the first time .",
    "se and kr are valuable tracers of _ s_-process enrichments in pne , since they are not expected to be depleted into dust ; kr is a noble gas , and se has not been found to be depleted in the diffuse ism @xcite . a more detailed discussion of the results from our survey can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have observed 103 galactic pne in the @xmath16  band ( 2.142.30  @xmath0 m ) with the coolspec spectrometer @xcite on the 2.7-m harlan j.  smith telescope at mcdonald observatory . including additional @xmath16  band spectra from the literature , our sample is comprised of 120 objects .",
    "we detected [ kr  iii ]  2.199 and/or [ se  iv ]  2.287  @xmath0 m in 81 of these objects , a remarkable detection rate considering the low cosmic abundances of se and kr ( @xmath17 relative to h in the solar system ; @xcite ) .",
    "these lines , first identified by @xcite , are resolved from other nebular features at our survey resolution of @xmath18 , with the exception of h@xmath19  @xmath202 lines in h@xmath19-emitting pne ( @xmath2130% of our targets ) .",
    "we removed the contaminating flux from these h@xmath19 lines with the aid of high - resolution ( @xmath22 ) observations and the measured fluxes of other observed h@xmath19 lines @xcite .",
    "kr@xmath23 and se@xmath24 ionic abundances were derived for each object , using a 5-level and 2-level model atom , respectively . to determine elemental se and kr abundances , we utilized the ionization correction factors ( icfs ) of @xcite , which were derived from cloudy @xcite and xstar @xcite photoionization models . the derived se and kr abundances are accurate to within a factor of 23 for most objects in our sample , taking into account uncertainties in the line fluxes , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and the fractional ionic abundances o@xmath23/o , ar@xmath23/ar , and s@xmath23/s ( taken from the literature ) that are incorporated into the icfs .    the choice of a reference element , for a metallicity - independent determination of _",
    "s_-process enrichments , is particularly important . for most objects in our sample ,",
    "we used o as a reference element since its abundance is generally more reliably determined than those of other elements .",
    "however , in type  i pne , we found that [ ar / o ] is larger by a factor of two relative to non - type  i pne . since ar is not processed by pn progenitor stars , this implies that o was destroyed in these objects .",
    "o destruction can occur during hot bottom burning , if the temperature at the base of the convective envelope is high enough for the on - cycle to be activated @xcite .",
    "therefore , we utilize ar as a reference element for type  i objects , and use the notation [ se/(o ,  ar ) ] and [ kr/(o ,  ar ) ] to underscore our choice of different reference elements for these two subclasses of pne .",
    "overall , we find a wide range of se and kr enrichment factors .",
    "the average [ kr/(o ,  ar ) ]  =  0.98 , with values for individual pne ranging from @xmath27 to 1.89 , while the mean [ se/(o ,  ar ) ]  =  0.31 , with extrema at @xmath28 and 0.90  dex . in 18 pne exhibiting both [ kr  iii ] and [ se  iv ] emission",
    ", we find that [ kr / se ]  =  0.5@xmath290.2 , in good agreement with theoretical predictions @xcite . in 41 of the 94 pne with derived abundances or meaningful upper limits , se and/or kr are enriched by more than a factor of two ( the dispersion of light _",

    "strong empirical evidence has been found for such a correlation in agb @xcite and post - agb stars @xcite .",
    "indeed , [ se/(o ,  ar ) ] and [ kr/(o ,  ar ) ] are positively correlated with the gaseous c / o ratio ( figure  1 ) , with correlation coefficients @xmath37 and 0.64 , respectively .",

    "s_-process enrichment compared to non - type  i pne ( table  1 , figure  2 ) .",
    "bipolar pne also show smaller _",
    "s_-process enrichments than elliptical pne , although the discrepancy is not as pronounced in this case .",
    "this has been verified with kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) tests , which show that the probabilities that the se and kr enrichments of type  i and non - type  i pne are drawn from the same cumulative distribution functions are @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively ; for bipolar and elliptical pne , @xmath44(se )  =  0.42 and @xmath44(kr )  =  0.21 .",
    "the low enrichment factors for type  i and bipolar pne are likely due to the small masses of their progenitor stars intershell layers ( relative to those of lower mass agb stars ) , as well as the severe dilution that the enriched material experiences when it is dredged - up into the massive envelopes of these stars @xcite .",
    "this result is in agreement with the marginal zr enrichments found by @xcite in a sample of intermediate - mass agb stars .",
    "[ wc ] pn central stars are h - deficient objects whose surface compositions are enriched in c and ( likely ) _",
    "n_-capture elements @xcite . it",
    "may therefore be expected that their surrounding nebulae are also enriched in these nuclei .",
    "however , we find that there is no systematic difference between the se and kr enrichments of [ wc ] pne and nebulae with h - rich central stars ( table  1 ) : ks tests show that there is an 85% and 99% probability that the se and kr abundances ( respectively ) in these two pn subclasses are drawn from the same cumulative distribution functions .",
    "it has previously been shown that the compositions of [ wc ] pne are similar to pne with h - rich nuclei for other elements @xcite , even c @xcite .",
    "relatively few pne in our sample exhibit _ direct _ evidence for binary central star systems .",
    "izzard ( @xcite , these proceedings ) showed that binary interactions that take place during the thermally - pulsing agb can truncate this phase of evolution by enhancing the mass - loss of the agb star .",
    "if this occurs , these systems will be less enriched in tdu products than otherwise similar single stars .",
    "interestingly , the 14 objects in our sample that display evidence of binary central stars exhibit little to no _ s_-process enrichment ( table  1 ) . however , this is not necessarily due to the binary companions , since the level of enrichment is also strongly dependent on the pn progenitor s initial mass .",
    "we have highlighted the major results from our large - scale survey of near - infrared [ kr  iii ] and [ se  iv ] emission lines in galactic pne .",
    "we detected se and/or kr emission in 81 out of 120 objects in our sample , of which 41 are significantly enriched due to _ in situ _ _ s_-process nucleosynthesis and tdu in their progenitor stars .",
    "se and kr abundances are correlated with the gaseous c / o ratio , as predicted by theoretical nucleosynthetic models .",
    "type  i and bipolar pne , whose progenitors are ims , exhibit little if any _ s_-process enrichment compared to objects with less massive progenitors . on the other hand , we find that [ wc ] pne are not systematically more _",
    "s_-process enriched than objects with h - rich nuclei , which stands in stark contrast to the strong c and probable _ s_-process enrichments of [ wc ] central stars .",
    "pne with binary central star systems show little evidence of _",
    "s_-process enrichments , as may be expected if binary interactions truncated their thermally - pulsing agb phase .",
    "the derived se and kr abundances are uncertain by a factor of 23 for most objects in our sample .",
    "we have shown that these uncertainties arise primarily from the icfs @xcite , for two reasons .",
    "first , we have detected only one ion each of se and kr .",
    "therefore , the icfs can be large and the uncertainties significant . secondly , the atomic data controlling the ionization balance of se and kr  photoionization ( pi ) cross - sections and rate coefficients for various recombination processes  are poorly if at all known ( indeed , this is true of most _",
    "n_-capture element ions ) . to derive the se and kr icfs , we used approximations for these atomic data in cloudy and xstar @xcite .",
    "we have recently instigated a new project to improve the accuracy of _ n_-capture element abundance determinations in pne . we are observing _",
    "s_-process enriched pne drawn from our near - infrared sample in the optical , in order to search for lines from additional ions of kr and se ( as well as transitions of other _ n_-capture elements ) . in the optical spectra of five pne ,",
    "we have detected [ kr  iv ] in four and [ kr  v ] in one thus far .",
    "the detection of additional ions reduces the magnitude and importance of uncertainties in the icfs .",
    "in addition , we are computing new atomic data for the first six ions of se and kr with the atomic structure code autostructure @xcite , including pi cross - sections and rate coefficients for radiative and dielectronic recombination .",
    "these calculations are complemented by experimental absolute pi cross - section measurements near the ionization threshold of these ions , performed at the advanced light source synchrotron radiation facility in berkeley , ca .",
    "the new atomic data determinations will enable us to derive more accurate and robust icfs with photoionization models .",
    "combined with the new observational data , this will significantly reduce uncertainties in se and kr abundance determinations in pne and allow for a more rigorous investigation of _ s_-process enrichments .",
