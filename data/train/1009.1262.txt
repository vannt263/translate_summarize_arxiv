    "schwarz symmetry principle is one of the celebrated tools in analysis and mathematical physics that has been attracting attention of many mathematicians @xcite @xcite , @xcite@xcite , @xcite@xcite . from the point of view of applications",
    "it is important to have an explicit reflection formula for a specific problem ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the open questions is the following : for what partial differential equations , boundary conditions and spatial dimensions such a formula exists and what is the structure of this formula , in other words , whether it is a point to point formula ( see , for example @xcite ) or it has a more complicated structure , for example , a point to a finite set @xcite or a point to a continuous set ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    ", we derive a reflection formula for solutions of elliptic equations in @xmath0 with respect to a non - singular real - analytic curve and study the obtained formula .",
    "we call this formula non - local , since unlike the classical point to point reflection ( see the theorem [ th1 ] below ) this is a point to compact set reflection , generalizing the following celebrated schwarz reflection principle for harmonic functions .",

    "note that if the point @xmath13 , then the `` reflected '' point @xmath14 .    here",
    "the mapping @xmath15 can be described by considering a complex domain @xmath16 in the space @xmath17 , such that @xmath18 , to which the function @xmath19 , defining the curve @xmath6 , is continued analytically .",
    "after the transformation of the variables , @xmath20 , @xmath21 the equation of the complexified curve @xmath22 can be rewritten in the form @xmath23 if @xmath24 on @xmath6 , can be solved with respect to @xmath25 or @xmath26 ; the corresponding solutions we denote as @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "the paper by p.  ebenfelt and d.  khavinson @xcite is devoted to further study of point - to - point reflection for harmonic functions .",

    "reflection properties of solutions of the helmholtz equation have also been considered in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
