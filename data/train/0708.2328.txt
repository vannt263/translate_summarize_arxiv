    "one had to treat the evolution of the system non - perturbatively .",
    "we have demonstrated that this situation is analogous to beatings resulting from the superposition of two oscillations . in both cases",
    "we have obtained neutrino wave functions , consistent with the initial conditions , and the transition probabilities .",

    "in particular we have suggested that artificial crystalline undulators could be useful for such a research .",

    "the general case of spin - flavor oscillations of dirac neutrinos in a twisting magnetic field with an arbitrary magnetic moment matrix has not been studied analytically earlier .",
    "both experimental and theoretical information about magnetic moments of dirac neutrinos is known to be very limited ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "therefore our results can be helpful since they enable one to describe phenomenologically spin - flavor oscillations of dirac neutrinos under the influence of the magnetic field in question provided neutrinos possess non - vanishing matrix of magnetic moments .",
