    "supersymmetric quantum mechanics has served as a testing and training ground for various concepts and ideas , for example the witten index @xcite , and nonperturbative techniques before they are applied to supersymmetric quantum field theories .",
    "it was recently found that when there is a quartic potential it allows an extension to a new type of supersymmetry , which was dubbed  @xcite .",
    "this discovery was actually made through the non - renormalization property found through the investigation of the nonperturbative properties of the theory by the application of the valley method @xcite@xcite : in refs.@xcite the nonperturbative part of the energy spectrum was calculated by the valley method , which , together with an understanding of the bogomolny s technique @xcite as the separation of the purely nonperturbative piece from the perturbative piece , led to the discovery of the disappearance of the leading borel singularity of the perturbative series at some discrete values of a parameter ( @xmath0 ) in the theory .",
    "one such value ( @xmath1 ) corresponded to the case when the theory becomes supersymmetric and the disappearance of the borel singularity is explained by the fact that the ground state does not receive any perturbative correction .",
    "thus it was speculated that at other integer values of @xmath2 , a new symmetry similar to the supersymmetry may exist to explain the non - renormalization properties , and in fact the authors of ref.@xcite succeeded in identifying it and named it  _ _ \" .",
    "the scope of the , however , were limited : while the ordinary supersymmetry allowed an arbitrary prepotential @xmath3 , under the @xmath0-fold supercharges defined in ref.@xcite the  was possible only for quadratic @xmath3 .",
    "in this letter we report a new  for a periodic potential , whose supercharges are different from the quadratic case . in section 2 , we summarize the ordinary supersymmetry and the  for quadratic @xmath3 . in section 3 , we prove a no - go theorem , which states that under the same @xmath2-fold supercharges as in ref.@xcite , only the quadratic @xmath3 is possible . the new  for a periodic potential",
    "is discussed in section 4 .",
    "let us first summarize the ordinary supersymmetry @xcite and set the notation .",
    "its two supercharges @xmath4 , @xmath5 and the hamiltonian @xmath6 satisfy the following algebra ; @xmath7=[{\\bf h } , q^\\dagger]=0.\\label{eqn : hqcom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the actual representation is constructed by considering a particle with a one - dimensional bosonic coordinate ( denoted by @xmath8 ) and a fermionic coordinate ( @xmath9 ) , which satisfy @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the supercharges are defined by the following : @xmath12 where the operators @xmath13 are defined by the following : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath3 is an _ arbitrary _ real function of the coordinate @xmath8 .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by the following ; @xmath16 in contrast to supersymmetric field theories , this theory allows the introduction of a matrix representation for the fermionic coordinates ; @xmath17 in this matrix representation , the supercharges are written as follows : @xmath18 while the hamiltonian is @xmath19 where @xmath20 or in terms of @xmath3 , @xmath21 in this matrix notation , the proof of the algebra ( [ eqn : qqdc])([eqn : hqcom ] ) is straightforward .",
    "specifically , the components of ( [ eqn : hqcom ] ) are the following conjugate pair ; @xmath22 which is a trivial relation derived from eq.([eqn : h12dd ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we use the matrix notation eq.([eqn : qqd])eq.([eqn : hpm ] ) .",
    "the @xmath2-fold supercharges are defined by the following : @xmath23 and the hamiltonian is ; @xmath24 where @xmath25 the following is the @xmath2-fold supersymmetric algebra : @xmath26=[{\\bf",
    "h}_{\\cal n } , q_{\\cal n}^\\dagger]=0 , \\label{eqn : hqcomn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which was proven for any integer @xmath2 when @xmath3 is a quadratic function of @xmath8 .",
    "( a proof of this is given in the next section . )",
    "a convenient canonical form of @xmath3 is the following : @xmath27 where the parameter @xmath28 is an analogue of the coupling constant . for small @xmath29 ,",
    "@xmath30 have asymmetric double - well potentials separated by the potential barrier of height of o(@xmath31 ( see fig.[fig : quad ] ) .     for @xmath32 .",
    "the potential for @xmath33 is obtained by a reflection @xmath34 .",
    "the energy levels are denoted by broken lines.,width=340 ]    at @xmath35 , the two wells become disjoint and two spectrum towers appear at around @xmath36 and @xmath37 . for integer values of @xmath2 ,",
    "the @xmath2-th excited state is degenerate , with the lowest state in the other tower .",
    "this is the case when the  exists and it protects the degeneracy when the coupling constant @xmath28 is turned on .",
    "the lowest @xmath2-states that do not have the corresponding states in the other spectrum are called  _ isolated states _ \" , which are free from borel singularities due to the , and in fact the perturbative series for the energy eigenvalues of these states have a finite convergence radius in the @xmath28-plane @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath38 is _ not _ equal to the anticommutator @xmath39 unless @xmath1 , which is the ordinary supersymmetric case .",
    "this is evident from the fact that @xmath40 contains @xmath2-derivatives with respect to the coordinate @xmath8 and therefore @xmath39 contains @xmath41-derivatives .",
    "the latter has , on the other hand , a `` family resemblance '' to the hamiltonian , and is thus called the  _ mother hamiltonian _ \" ; @xmath42 the following commutation relation is , of course , satisfied :",
    "@xmath43=[{\\cal h}_{\\cal n } , q_{\\cal n}^\\dagger]=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it was conjectured that this mother hamiltonian @xmath44 is a polynomial of the ordinary hamiltonian @xmath38 ; @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a @xmath47 matrix obtained from the perturbative solution of the @xmath2 isolated states @xcite .",
    "the identity ( [ eqn : mh ] ) was proven for @xmath48 by hand , and for values up to @xmath49 by the use of mathematica .",
    "as noted before the  for @xmath50 were found only for the particular @xmath3 defined by eq.([eqn : wq ] ) , while the @xmath1 ordinary supersymmetry holds for any arbitrary function @xmath3 .",
    "therefore it is most natural to explore what other kinds of @xmath3 allow .",
    "furthermore , for the quadratic @xmath3 the supersymmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "therefore it is interesting to examine if  exists without spontaneous supersymmetry breaking .",
    "it is possible to explore what kind of @xmath3 is allowed under the supercharges ( [ eqn : qqdn ] ) , but with the following generalized hamiltonian : @xmath51 the components of the desired commutation relation ( [ eqn : hqcomn ] ) are the following : @xmath52 and its conjugate . in order to find the constraints for @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath53 induced by the above relation , we will calculate the difference between the l.h.s .  and the r.h.s .  of the above : @xmath54 where we used a relation @xmath55 .",
    "since @xmath56 where @xmath57 , we may transform all the @xmath58s to @xmath59s by the @xmath60-transformation ; @xmath61 the next step is to move all the derivatives to the right and examine the coefficients of a given power of @xmath62 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the coefficients of @xmath63 and @xmath64 vanish identically .",
    "the @xmath65 term and @xmath66 term yields the following , respectively : @xmath67 these lead to ; @xmath68 where @xmath69 is an integration constant .",
    "this reproduces the original hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hamin ] ) with a meaningless constant @xmath69 added . from the coefficient of @xmath70 we find the following : @xmath71 the lower powers of @xmath62 have coefficients proportional to the derivatives of @xmath72 of order four or more .",
    "therefore , we conclude that under the assumption of the form of the supercharges ( [ eqn : qqdn ] ) and the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hpmnrelaxed ] ) , the commutation relation ( [ eqn : hqcomn ] ) holds only for the following three cases : ( 1 ) @xmath73 , the trivial case with arbitrary @xmath3 , ( 2 ) @xmath74 , the ordinary supersymmetry with arbitrary @xmath3 , and ( 3 ) @xmath75 , the quadratic @xmath3 found previously .",
    "this proves that as long as the supercharges are of the form ( [ eqn : qqdn ] ) , no new  is possible .",
    "we will now examine the following case : @xmath76 with periodicity @xmath77 .",
    "ordinary supersymmetry is not broken since the region of @xmath8 is finite , unlike the quadratic case .",
    "we define new @xmath2-fold supercharges by the following : @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "note that the above product is always in the range @xmath80 even for the half integer @xmath81 ( even @xmath2 ) .",
    "the supercharges ( [ eqn : qqdnperi ] ) contain @xmath2-derivatives , but are different from the form ( [ eqn : qqdn ] ) , and are free from the constraint of the no - go theorem proven in the previous section .",
    "the hamiltonian is the same as in eqs.([eqn : hamin ] ) and ( [ eqn : hpmn ] ) .",
    "the potential of @xmath82 is illustrated in fig.[fig : peri ] .",
    "we first prove the commutation relation ( [ eqn : hqcomn ] ) , whose components are ; @xmath86 and its conjugate . as in the previous section ,",
    "we transform the both sides of the above identity by the @xmath60-transformation .",
    "the following is useful for this calculation : @xmath87 the l.h.s . of eq.([eqn : periphn ] ) is then calculated as follows : @xmath88 which is identical to @xmath89 .",
    "this completes the proof of ( [ eqn : periphn ] ) .",
    "there is an alternative , more complex but more direct , proof of the identity ( [ eqn : periphn ] ) , which is similar to the proof of the quadratic case in ref.@xcite .",
    "we first note the following relation : @xmath90.\\ ] ] using this relation repeatedly , it is possible to show the following relation for any integer @xmath91 and @xmath92 by the mathematical induction for @xmath93 : @xmath94 . \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this relation reproduces the desired commutation relation ( [ eqn : periphn ] ) for @xmath95 .",
    "if we now turn to the isolated states and the mother hamiltonian next , we see that in the ordinary , the algebra ( [ eqn : oldnfold ] ) guarantees that any solution @xmath96 of the shrdinger equation of the hamiltonian @xmath97 is a solution of the hamiltonian @xmath98 with the same eigenvalue , _ unless _ it is eliminated by @xmath99 ; @xmath100 this equation is satisfied by @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a polynomial of order @xmath103 or less .",
    "the solution ( [ eqn : psifn ] ) is not normalizable due to the @xmath104-term in @xmath3 , but it is so at any finite order of the perturbation expansion in @xmath28 .",
    "thus the perturbative properties , especially the energy eigenvalues , of the isolated states are determined completely by the .",
    "the fact that the solution ( [ eqn : psifn ] ) is not normalizable means that there are nonperturbative corrections on the isolated states and the  is spontaneously broken @xcite .    in the current case",
    ", we have @xmath105 in place of ( [ eqn : elimi ] ) , which is satisfied by @xmath102 of the form of the truncated fourier series ; @xmath106 by substituting the above into the shrdinger equation @xmath107 and using ( [ eqn : hntrans ] ) , we find the following set of equations for the coefficients ( @xmath108 ) : @xmath109 for @xmath110 , where @xmath111 and @xmath112 should be understood to be zero .",
    "we rewrite the above to the matrix equation for the vector @xmath113 as follows : @xmath114 the energies of the isolated states are obtained from the following condition that nontrivial @xmath115 are allowed as solutions of the above ; @xmath116 it should be noted that unlike the quadratic case , the solutions of eq.([eqn : yatta ] ) are exact : their wavefunctions are normalizable and therefore there are no nonperturbative corrections to the energy levels obtained from eq.([eqn : yatta ] ) .",
    "since eq.([eqn : yatta ] ) is a polynomial equation for @xmath117 , its solutions have a finite convergence radius in @xmath28 and thus is borel - summable .",
    "for example , at @xmath118 , eq.([eqn : yatta ] ) yields the following ; @xmath119 whose solutions have infinite convergence radius .",
    "it is interesting to note that the _ exact _ energy of the first excited state is @xmath120 , which is only the first order correction , which is analogous to the abs anomaly .",
    "it should be noted that these solutions for the isolated states come with specific boundary conditions ; periodic for odd @xmath2 and anti - periodic for even @xmath2 .",
    "no exact solutions with other twisted boundary conditions has been found so far .",
    "we conjecture that the mother hamiltonian @xmath44 defined by @xmath121 with the supercharges ( [ eqn : qqdnperi ] ) is again given by the following polynomial of the usual hamiltonian ; @xmath122 we have proven the above identity directly for @xmath118 by the use of mathematica .",
    "we have found some further extensions of the @xmath2-fold supersymmetry are possible , including cubic and exponential @xmath3s .",
