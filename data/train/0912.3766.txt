    "the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ was launched on june 11 , 2008 from cape kennedy , florida opening a new era in the knowledge of high - energy @xmath0-ray band .",
    "the high sensitivity , large dinamic range and excellent time coverage of the large area telescope , the primary instrument on board _ fermi _ , all represent significant advantages over the previous @xmath0-ray observations and will play a key role in the understanding of the physical processes underlying the high energy emission of blazars .",
    "typical agn are radio - quiet and are found in large numbers of optical and x - ray frequencies .",
    "blazars are rare extra - galactic objects , about 10@xmath7 of the entire population of agn , where a jet of plasma , moving at relativistic speed is pointing close to the line of sight of the observer @xcite .",
    "however , blazars strong non - thermal emission over the entire electro - magnetic spectrum makes them the dominant type of extragalactic sources in those energy windows where the accretion onto a supermassive black hole , or other thermal machenism , do not produce much radiation . although blazars have been observed for tens of years now , the exististing experimental data do not allow one to unambiguously identify the physical mechanism responsible for the electromagnetic emission .",
    "given the existing high sensitivity detectors to study the low energy component ( radio , ir , optical and x - rays ) , one of the main reasons for this lack of understanding was the low instrumental background between 0.5  mev to 300  gev .",
    "this poor sensitivity often precluded detailed cross - correlation studies between low and high energy emission models , implying more and higher quality data at @xmath0-ray energies to better understand these objects .",
    "simultaneous and detailed spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are indeed needed to cover the greatest possible band of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "in fact , one of the most effective ways of studying blazar s physical properties is through the use of multi - frequency data that , so far , have been carried out almost exclusively on the occasion of large flaring events of a few bright and well known blazars .",
    "in this contribution i report on the properties of broad - band ( radio to high energy @xmath0-ray ) seds of a sample of 48 _ fermi _ bright blazars reported in @xcite .",
    "the detailed seds have been built and studied using simultaneous or quasi - simultaneous data taken from may 2008 to january 2009 and obtained from _ fermi _ , _ swift _ , and other space based or ground telescopes such as agile @xmath0-ray data , effelsberg , ovro , ratan-600 1 - 22  ghz , radio , mm , nir and optical data from the gasp - webt collaboration , mid - infrared visir observations .",
    "the results of _ fermi _ lat observations in the first three months of science operations are reported in the first lat bright gamma - ray source list @xcite that includes 132 sources at galactic latitude @xmath8b@xmath910@xmath10 , with test statistic greater than 100 ( @xmath11 10 @xmath12 ) . among these , a sample of 106 sources indicate high - confidence associations with known agn and is referred to as the lat bright agn sample ( lbas ) @xcite , comprising 58 fsrqs , 42 bl lac objects , 4 blazar of uncertain type and 2 radio - galaxies .",
    "it is confirmed that the bright @xmath0-ray sky is dominated by radio - loud agn .",
    "in fact about 90@xmath7 of the lbas sources is associated to agn listed in radio catalogs ( crates / cgrabs , bzcat ) .",
    "moreover only about one third of the bright _ fermi _ agn were also detected by egret .",
    "blazars represent a subgroup of non - thermal dominated agn . for a more detailed classification of agn refer to @xcite .",
    "blazars are extremely strong and highly variable , core dominated flat or inverted spectrum radio loud agn whose jet is looked closely to the line of sight of the observer .",
    "blazars can be further divided into two subgroups :    * fsrqs showing broad emission lines in their optical spectrum just like normal qso ( quasi stellar objects ) and including flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and broad line radio galaxies . *",
    "bl lacs ( or bl lacertae objects ) that do not show any strong or broad line in their optical spectrum and whose radio compactness and broad - band sed are very similar to that of strong lined blazars .",
    "a further classification of bl lac objects @xcite comprises three subclasses ( lbl ibl and hbl , as low , intermediate and high peaked bl lacs ) depending on the position in the sed of the peak energy of the synchrotron emission that reflects the maximum energy the particles can be accelerated in the jet .",
    "this classification has been extended to all blazars that can be classified into low , intermediate and high energy ( synchrotron ) peaked blazars , respectively called lsp ( synchrotron peak @xmath1310@xmath14  hz ) , isp ( 10@xmath1510@xmath16 ) and hsp ( @xmath1710@xmath16 ) in the lsp case , the x - ray emission is flat and due to the rising part of the inverse compton component . at these relatively low energies",
    "it occurs in the thomson regime ; in the isp case , the x - ray band includes both the tail of the synchrotron emission and the rise of the inverse compton component .",
    "finally , in the hsp case , where the emitting particles are accelerated at much higher energies than in lsps , the synchrotron emission dominates the observed flux in the x - ray band and the inverse compton scattering occurs in the klein - nishina regime ( see fig.[fig : classif ] ) .    ) in their sed .",
    "low synchrotron peaked blazars , or lsp are those where ( @xmath18 ) is located at frequencies lower than 10@xmath14  hz ( lower dotted line ) , intermediated synchrotron peaked sources or isp 10@xmath1510@xmath16  hz ( seds with peak within the gray area).,width=283 ]",
    "the 48 sources chosen from the lbas list to study their broad band sed using simultaneous or quasi simultaneous radio to high - energy @xmath0-ray data , were chosed on the basis of the availability of _ swift _ observations carried out between may 2008 and january 2009 ( which have been scheduled largely independently of _ fermi _ results ) and not on brightness level or any other condition that could influence the shape of the sed .",
    "this was checked by verifying that the distributions of redshift , optical , x - ray and @xmath0-ray fluxes are all consistent with being the same in both subsamples .",
    "the quasi - simultaneous seds have been built in the usual log@xmath19-log(@xmath19f(@xmath19 ) ) representation .",
    "a detailed description of the data analysis performed to derive the seds is reported in @xcite .",
    "it is worth to underline that all seds exhibit the typical double hump distribution , with the first bump attributed to synchrotron radiation and the second one likely due to one or more components related to inverse compton emission .",
    "fig.[fig:3c66a ] and [ fig : mrk501 ] show the seds of two sources among the 48 lbas : 3c66a and mrk501 which can be classified as an isp and hsp respectively .",
    "a comparison between the two seds shows the differences in the position of the peaks of the two components and of the relative peak intensities .",
    "this behaviour is generally found in all seds .",
    "large variability is also present , especially at optical / uv and x - ray frequencies .",
    "gamma - ray variability can not be evaluated as the _ fermi _ data used for our analysis are averaged over the entire period of data taking .",
    "the @xmath0-ray variability of the lbas blazars is separately discussed in @xcite , while a complete description of the @xmath0-ray spectral shape of the lbas sources is given in @xcite . from the results of the latter paper , we note that often _",
    "fermi _ data can not be fit by a simple power law as significant curvature is detected .",
    "convex curvature is often observed in sources where synchrotron peak is located at low energies ( e.g. pks0454 - 234 , pks1454 - 354 and pks1502 + 106 , 3c454.3 etc ) whereas very flat or even concave type curvature is exhibited by high synchrotron peaked objects ( e.g. 3c66a , see fig.[fig:3c66a ] , pks0447 - 439 , 1es  0502 + 675 and pg  1246 + 586 ) .",
    "the key observational parameters that characterize the seds of the lbas sources have been estimated : the radio spectral index ( @xmath20 ) , the peak frequency ( @xmath18 ) and the peak intensity flux of the synchrotron component ( @xmath18f(@xmath18 ) ) , the peak frequency ( @xmath21 ) and the peak intensity flux of the inverse compton component ( @xmath21f(@xmath21 ) )    the radio to microwave spectral slope @xmath20 has been measured by performing a linear regression of all radio flux measurements used for the seds , both quasi - simultaneous and historical ones .",
    "the results of this evaluation is that the measured slope in our seds is quite flat ( @xmath220 ) and consistent with being the same in all blazar types .",
    "fig.[fig : alfaxr ] shows the plot of the optical to x - ray spectral slope @xmath2 versus the radio to optical spectral slope @xmath2 .",
    "the plot includes all blazars in the bzcat catalog for which we have radio , optical and x - ray measurements ( small red dots ) .",
    "_ fermi _ fsrqs ( filled circles ) , like all fsrqs discovered in any other energy band , are exclusively located along the top - left / bottom - right band , whereas bl lacs ( open circles ) can be found in all parts of the plane , even if with a prevalence in the horizontal area defined by values of @xmath1 between 0.2 and 0.4 , which is where hsp sources are located @xcite .",
    "all @xmath0-ray selected blazars are located in regions covered by previously known blazars .",
    "no new @xmath0-ray type of blazars has been found , in particular there is no evidence for the hypothetical population of ultra - high energy peaked blazars ( uhbls ) , with synchrotron peak in the @xmath0-ray band ( @xmath2310@xmath24 ) .",

    "the value of @xmath18 in the sed of a blazar can be analytically determined from the following relationship :    @xmath31    where x=0.565 - 1.433@xmath32 + 0.155@xmath33 and y=1.0 - 0.661@xmath32 - 0.339@xmath33 .",

    "the distribution of the difference between the values obtained with the two methods has a mean value of 0.04 and a standard deviation of 0.58 , implying that the value of log(@xmath18 ) can be derived even from non - simultaneous values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 within 0.6 decade at one sigma level and within 1 decade in almost all cases .",
    "it is worth to underline that this method assumes that the optical and x - ray fluxes are not contaminated by thermal emission from the disk or accretion . in blazars where thermal flux components are not negligible",

    "also in this case , the scatter around the solid line , representing perfect match , has an average value of -0.01 for the difference between the two estimates and a standard deviation of 0.33 .",
    "it is quite remarkable that one can derive the synchrotron peak flux simply from @xmath18 and from the radio flux as this implies that within a factor of 10 the radio emission represents a long - term calorimeter for the whole jet activity and the basic source power .",

    "the distribution of the synchrotron peak frequency ( @xmath18 ) of lbas blazars ( estimated using the @xmath2-@xmath1 method ) shows that while the @xmath18 distribution of fsrqs starts at @xmath3910@xmath3  hz , peaks at 10@xmath40  hz and it does not extend beyond @xmath4110@xmath4  hz , the distribution of bl lacs is much flatter , @xmath3910 , it starts at @xmath3910@xmath42  hz and reaches much higher frequencies ( @xmath4110@xmath6  hz ) than that of fsrqs .",

    "it can be noted that the @xmath18 distribution of fsrqs is consistent with being the same in the @xmath0-ray , radio / microwave and in the x - ray band .",
    "moreover , the large majority of fsrqs are of the lsp type while no fsrqs of the hsp type have been found at any frequency . on the contrary ,",
    "the @xmath18 distribution of bl lac objects is very different in the three energy bands .",
    "it is strongly peaked at @xmath3910@xmath40  hz in the microwave band , where hsp sources are very rare , whereas in the x - ray and and @xmath0-ray bands hsp sources are more abundant than lsps . on the other side , the distribution of the inverse compton peak frequency @xmath21 , of the fsrq ( dot - dashed histogram ) and the bl lacs ( solid histogram ) in the lbas sample .",

    "the collection of seds allowed us to estimate important parameters characterizing the sed of @xmath0-ray selected blazars , such as the frequency and intensity of both the synchrotron and inverse compton peaks , both directly from the simultaneous data or indirectly using a refined version of the method proposed in @xcite based on the position in the @xmath2-@xmath1 plane for the former and on the slope of the @xmath0-ray spectrum for the latter , as the @xmath0-ray spectral slope and @xmath21 are strongly correlated . among the several results we obtained ,",
    "we can conclude that @xmath0-ray selected blazars have broad - band spectral properties similar to those of radio and x - ray discovered blazars implying that they are all drawn from the same underlying population ; the distribution of the synchrotron peak frequency is very different for the fsrq and bl lac subsamples .",
    "the results rule out the existence of fsrqs of the hsp type , consistent with what also observed in radio , microwave and x - ray surveys ; the bl lac minimum @xmath18appears to be larger than in fsrqs and this could be due to some intrinsic difference in the mechanism of particle acceleration in the two types of blazars or to a mere selection effect .",
