    "a fundamental problem of broad theoretical and practical interest is to characterize the maximum correlation between the outputs of a pair of functions of random sequences .",
    "consider the two distributed agents shown in figure [ fig : agents ] .",
    "a pair of correlated discrete memoryless sources ( dms ) are fed to the two agents .",
    "these agents are to each make a binary decision .",
    "the goal of the problem is to maximize the correlation between the outputs of these agents subject to specific constraints on the decision functions .",
    "the study of this setup has had impact on a variety of disciplines , for instance , by taking the agents to be two encoders in the distributed source coding problem @xcite , or two transmitters in the interference channel problem @xcite , or alice and bob in a secret key - generation problem @xcite , or two agents in a distributed control problem @xcite .",
    "a special case of the problem is the study of common - information ( ci ) generated by the two agents . as an example , consider two encoders in a slepian - wolf ( sw ) setup .",
    "let @xmath0 , and @xmath1 be independent , non - constant binary random variables .",
    "then , an encoder observing the dms @xmath2 , and an encoder observing @xmath3 agree on the value of @xmath1 with probability one .",
    "the random variable @xmath1 is called the ci observed by the two encoders .",
    "these encoders require a sum - rate equal to @xmath4 to transmit the source to the decoder .",
    "this gives a reduction in rate equal to the entropy of @xmath1 , compared to the transmission of the sources over independent point - to - point channels .",
    "the gain in performance is directly related to the entropy of the ci .",
    "so , it is desirable to maximize the entropy of the ci between the encoders .",
    "in @xcite , the authors investigated multi - letterization as a method for increasing the ci .",
    "they showed that multi - letterization does not lead to an increase in the ci .",
    "more precisely , they prove the following statement :     _ let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be two sequences of dmss .",
    "let @xmath7 and @xmath8 be two sequences of functions which converge to one another in probability .",
    "then , the normalized entropies @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are less than or equal to the entropy of the ci between @xmath5 and @xmath6 for large @xmath11 . _",
    "a stronger version of the result was proved by witsenhausen @xcite , where maximum correlation between the outputs is upper - bounded subject to the following restrictions on the decision functions : + _ 1 ) the entropy of the binary output is fixed .",
    "+ 2 ) the agents cooperate with each other .",
    "_    it was shown that maximum correlation is achieved if both users output a single element of the string without further processing ( e.g. each user outputs the first element of its corresponding string ) .",
    "this was used to conclude that common - information can not be induced by multi - letterization . while , the result was used extensively in a variety of areas such as information theory , security , and control @xcite , in many problems , there are additional constraints on the set of admissible decision functions . for example",
    ", one can consider constraints on the ` effective length ' of the decision functions .",
    "this is a valid assumption , for instance , in the case of communication systems , the users have lower - bounds on their effective lengths due to the rate - distortion requirements in the problem @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "the problem under these additional constraints is considered . a new upper - bound on the correlation between the outputs of arbitrary pairs of boolean functions",
    "is derived .",
    "the bound is presented as a function of the dependency spectrum of the boolean functions .",
    "this is done in several steps .",
    "first , the effective length of an additive boolean function is defined .",
    "then , we use a method similar to @xcite , and map the boolean functions to the set of real - valued functions .",
    "using tools in real analysis , we find an additive decomposition of these functions .",
    "the decomposition components have well - defined effective lengths . using the decomposition",
    "we find the dependency spectrum of the boolean function .",
    "the dependency spectrum is a generalization of the effective length and is defined for non - additive boolean functions .",
    "lastly , we use the dependency spectrum to derive the new upper - bound .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : not ] presents the notation used in the paper .",
    "section [ sec : eff ] develops useful mathematical machinery to analyze boolean function .",
    "section [ sec : corr ] contains the main result of the paper .",
    "finally , section [ sec : con ] concludes the paper .",
    "in this section , we introduce the notation used in this paper .",
    "we represent random variables by capital letters such as @xmath12 .",
    "sets are denoted by calligraphic letters such as @xmath13 .",
    "particularly , the set of natural numbers and real numbers are shown by @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , respectively . for random variables ,",
    "the @xmath11-length vector @xmath16 is denoted by @xmath17 . the binary string @xmath18 is written as @xmath19 .",
    "the vector of random variables @xmath20 , j_i\\neq j_k$ ] , is denoted by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "for example , take @xmath23 , the vector @xmath24 is denoted by @xmath25 , and the vector @xmath26 by @xmath27 . for two binary strings @xmath28 , we write @xmath29 if and only if @xmath30 $ ] . for a binary string",
    "@xmath19 we define @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the hamming weight .",
    "lastly , the vector @xmath33 is the element - wise complement of @xmath19 .",
    "in this section , we study the correlation between the output of a boolean function with subsets of the input .",
    "particularly , we are interested in the answers to questions such as ` how strongly does the first element @xmath34 affect the output of @xmath35 ? ' ` is this effect amplified when we take @xmath36 into account as well ? ' ` is there a subset of random variables that ( almost ) determines the value of the output ? ' .",
    "we formulate these questions in mathematical terms , and find a characterization of the dependency spectrum of a boolean function .",
    "the dependency spectrum is a vector which captures the correlation between different subsets of the input elements with each element of the output . as an intermediate step ,",
    "we define the effective length of an additive boolean function below :    for a boolean function @xmath37 defined by @xmath38 $ ] , where the addition operator is the binary addition , the effective length is defined as the cardinality of the set @xmath39 .    for a general boolean function ( e.g. non - additive ) , we find a decomposition of @xmath40 into a set of functions @xmath41 whose effective length is well - defined .",
    "first , we provide a mapping from the set of boolean functions to the set of real functions .",
    "this allows us to use the tools available in real analysis to analyze these functions .",

    "example [ ex : ex1 ] gives a decomposition of the space @xmath55 .",
    "next , we introduce another decomposition of @xmath55 which turns out to be very useful .",
    "let @xmath63 be the subset of all measurable functions of @xmath5 which have 0 mean , and let @xmath64 be the set of constant real functions of @xmath5 .",

    "the decomposition is given by : @xmath87 the variances of these functions are given below : @xmath88 as we shall see in the next section , these variances play a major role in determining the correlation preserving properties of @xmath45 .",
