    "despite of its tremendeous success in describing wealth of existing experimental data , the standard model ( sm ) has significant shortcomings , e.g. the hierarchy problem and the failure to explain origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking , matter - antimatter asymmetry , and apparent presence of dark matter .",
    "many of the extensions proposed to resolve some or most of these problems predict the existence of new heavy particles .",
    "heavy neutral bosons appear in many models , e.g. @xmath0 s appearing in the string - inspired e6 models  @xcite , randall - sundrum ( rs ) gravitons  @xcite , heavy new bosons appearing in `` little higgs ''  @xcite and left - right symmetric models  @xcite , sneutrinos in r - parity violating susy@xcite , as well as strongly interacting excited axigluons  @xcite , colorons  @xcite , techni-@xmath1 s  @xcite .",
    "similarly , leptoquarks appear in models intending to explain the apparent lepton - quark symmetry of the sm  @xcite .",
    "another example is susy with r - parity violation where a leptoquark role can be taken by scalar quarks . while different models have varying predictions for the new particle production and decay mechanisms and dynamics , they all share similar experimental signatures and have been the subject of exhaustive experimental searches at both cdf and d0 experiments at the tevatron .",
    "this contribution reviews some of the most recent of those searches .",
    "in many schemes of gut symmetry - breaking , u(1 ) gauge groups survive to relatively low energies  @xcite , leading to the prediction of neutral gauge vector bosons , generically referred to as z@xmath2 bosons .",
    "such z@xmath2 bosons typically couple with electroweak strength to sm fermions , and can be observed at hadron colliders as narrow , spin-1 , dilepton resonances from @xmath3 .",
    "many other sm extensions , such as the left - right symmetric  [ 5 ] and the `` little higgs '' models  @xcite , also predict heavy neutral gauge bosons . additional spatial dimensions are a possible explanation for the gap between the electroweak symmetry breaking scale and the gravitational energy scale @xmath4 . in the randall - sundrum ( rs )",
    "scenario  @xcite , the ground - state wave function of the graviton is localized on a three - dimensional `` brane '' separated in a fourth spatial dimension from the sm brane .",
    "the wave function varies exponentially in this fourth dimension , causing its overlap with the sm brane to be suppressed and explaining the apparent weakness of gravity and the large value of @xmath4 .",
    "this model predicts excited kaluza - klein modes of the graviton which are localized on the sm brane .",
    "these modes appear as spin-2 resonances @xmath5 in the process @xmath6 , with a narrow intrinsic width when @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the spacetime curvature in the extra dimension .",
    "spin-0 resonances such as the sneutrino @xmath9 in the process @xmath10 are predicted by supersymmetric theories with r - parity violation  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , these new bosons are sought by looking for narrow resonances in di - electron or di - muon spectra .",
    "these final states are nearly free of instrumental backgrounds and are dominated by the irreducible drell - yan contribution .",
    "cdf has recently published results on searches for @xmath0 and ed graviton in di - electron and di - muon channels  @xcite using 2.5 @xmath11 and 2.3 @xmath11 of data , respectively .",
    "analysis in the muon channel requires two oppositely charged tracks with @xmath12 gev / c , consistent with the hypothesis that they are minimum ionizing particles .",
    "figure  [ fig : dimuon_figure ] shows the invariant mass distribution demonstrating impressive agreement between data and the sm expectation . with no excess , the cross - section limit is calculated and is shown in fig .  [ fig : dimuon_figure ] for different @xmath0 species . for rs @xmath5 ,",
    "the limit is @xmath13 gev / c@xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "a similar search in the di - electron channel yields @xmath16 gev / c@xmath14 .",
    "there are several compelling scenarios motivating searches for heavy new resonances decaying to quarks and gluons . in chiral color models , the su(3 ) gauge group of qcd results from the spontaneous breaking of the chiral color gauge group of @xmath17 , leading to the presence of the axigluon , a massive axial vector gluon , that decays to @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19 gut model also predicts the presence of a diquark which decays to @xmath20 or @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the flavor - universal coloron model  @xcite predicts the presence of a color - octet coloron which decays to @xmath18 , models of extended technicolor and topcolor - assisted technicolor  @xcite predict the presence of a color - octet techni-@xmath1 ( @xmath22 ) decaying to @xmath18 or @xmath23 . together with dilepton analyses , searches with dijets improve sensitivity to the models predicting @xmath0 bosons and ed gravitons discussed earlier . in the case of rs model",
    ", dijet channels may have special importance as the effective coupling of @xmath5 to the sm particles can be enhanced or suppressed depending on their localization  @xcite .",
    "a recent cdf study  @xcite examines the dijet spectrum looking for evidence of a new resonance on top of the qcd dijet spectrum using 1.1 @xmath11 of data collected using jet triggers . after removing instrumental backgrounds , e.g. beam losses and cosmic rays ,",
    "jets are corrected for non - uniformities and non - linearities in the calorimeter response , and the two highest @xmath24 jets are used to calculate the dijet mass @xmath25 . after correcting for smearing due to calorimeter resolution and offline selection requirements , the resulting @xmath25 spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dijet_figure ] . the search for dijet mass resonances",
    "is performed by parameterizing the shape of the dijet distribution with a smooth function and fitting data for statistically significant deviations consistent with the new dijet resonances .",
    "figure  [ fig : dijet_figure ] depicts the expected shape of the `` bump '' due to a new physics resonance using an excited quark model as an example .",
    "note that the shape is nearly independent of the type of resonance as it is dominated by the calorimeter resolution . with no excess ,",
    "the data are used to restrict allowed cross - section for new particle production in several new physics scenarios as well as the new particle masses .",
    "figure  [ fig : dijet_figure ] shows corresponding exclusion plots for benchmark @xmath0 and rs graviton @xmath5 scenarios .",
    "the search excludes @xmath26 gev / c@xmath14 for the axigluon and flavor - universal coloron , @xmath27 gev / c@xmath14 for the e6 diquark , @xmath28 gev / c@xmath14 for @xmath22 .",
    "searches for new heavy bosons decaying to a pair of sm gauge bosons , e.g. @xmath29 or @xmath30 , can provide an important complementarity to the dilepton channels . furthermore ,",
    "if for some reason the coupling of new bosons to fermions is suppressed , the di - boson mode can hold the key to discovery of new physics , e.g. as modified rs scenarios discussed earlier where sm particles can be in the bulk , e.g. leading to reduced effective couplings of @xmath5 to leptons  @xcite .",
    "cdf has recently performed a search  @xcite for heavy new resonance decaying to @xmath29 using 2.9 @xmath11 of data .",
    "the search is performed using the @xmath31+met final state , where one of the @xmath32 s decays leptonically and the other one is allowed to decay into a pair of jets to enhance the acceptance of the analysis compared to the purely leptonic mode .",
    "selected events are required to have an isolated electron ( @xmath33 gev ) , a missing @xmath33 gev , 2 or 3 jets with @xmath34 and @xmath35 gev , and an overall @xmath36 gev .",
    "@xmath37 is defined as the sum of the electron @xmath24 , the missing @xmath24 and the jet @xmath24 of all jets in the event . to reconstruct the @xmath29 topology ,",
    "the electron and missing @xmath24 are used to solve for missing @xmath38 under the assumption that the electron momentum and missing energy comprise the @xmath32 mass .",
    "the event is dropped if no solution is possible .",
    "events are further required to have a pair of jets with the di - jet invariant mass consistent with the @xmath32 mass within resolution .",
    "the final step is to optimize selections for either the @xmath5 or ssm @xmath0 hypothesis , and separately for several possible mass ranges of the new boson .",
    "this is achieved by selecting sub - samples with varying minimum thresholds for missing @xmath24 , lepton and jet @xmath24 .",
    "the reconstructed invariant mass of candidate events for one of such sub - samples is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ww_figure ] . with no statistically significant excess of data over sm",

    "models attempting to explain the symmetry of the lepton and quark sectors in the sm often predict the existence of leptoquarks ( lq )  @xcite . those are scalar or vector particles carrying both a lepton and a baryon quantum number . at hadron colliders , new colored particles predicted by various extensions of the standard model ( sm ) would be abundantly produced if they are light enough .",
    "to satisfy experimental constraints on changing neutral current interactions , leptoquarks couple only within a single generation .",
    "leptoquarks decay into a charged lepton and a quark with a branching ratio @xmath43 , or into a neutrino and a quark with a branching ratio @xmath44 .",
    "pair production of leptoquarks assuming @xmath45 therefore leads only to a final state consisting of two neutrinos and two quarks .",
    "the corresponding experimental signature is the presence of jets and missing transverse energy resulting from the decay of those particles .",
    "a recent d0 analysis  @xcite explores the @xmath46missing @xmath24 channel by analyzing events with the topology consisting of exactly two jets and missing @xmath24 using 2.5 @xmath11 of data . because the final state has no leptons , the analysis has similar acceptance to leptoquarks belonging to any of the three possible generations . before final optimization",
    ", the event selection requires presence of exactly two acoplanar jets ( @xmath47 ) with @xmath48 gev in the central part of the detector and missing @xmath24 over 75 gev . to minimize instrumental mismeasurements of missing energy and suppress large qcd multi - jet background contamination , the missing @xmath24 in selected events is required to point away from any of the jets in the event .",
    "events containing identified lepton or isolated track candidates are removed to reduce the @xmath49jet and @xmath50 backgrounds .",
    "figure  [ fig : lqjetmet_figure ] shows the distribution of @xmath37 defined as a scalar sum of the transverse energies of the jets in the event and the missing @xmath24 . at this stage ,",
    "the analysis is split into two separate searches targeting signals of either lower or higher leptoquark mass .",
    "best sensitivity to lighter leptoquark signal is achieved by additionally requiring @xmath51 gev , while the higher mass search requires @xmath52 gev and uses a tighter cut on missing @xmath24 of 125 gev .",
