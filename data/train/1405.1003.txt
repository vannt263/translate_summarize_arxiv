    "this is nothing else but the first order asymptotic analysis of the multinomial combinatorics : @xmath22 when the disorder of the system is better described by a probability density function @xmath23 instead of a discrete probability measure , we may introduce by analogy , or passage to the limit , the continuous boltzmann entropy of @xmath24 , denoted @xmath25 , or @xmath26 in the terminology of boltzmann , @xmath27 when @xmath28 is a random variable , we denote by @xmath29 the entropy of its law . here",

    "when @xmath24 and @xmath31 have same average energy , then we recover the formula for the boltzmann entropy . as we will see later on , the helmholtz free energy @xmath62 plays a role for markov processes .",

    "boltzmann wanted to derive the second principle from the idea ( controversial , at that time ) that the matter is made with atoms .",
    "let us consider an ideal isolated gas made with particles ( molecules ) in a box with periodic boundary conditions ( torus ) to keep things as simple as possible .",
    "there are of course too many particles to write the equations of newton for all of them .",
    "newton is in a way beated by avogadro !",
    "the idea of boltzmann was to propose a statistical approach ( perhaps inspired from the one of euler in fluid mechanics , and from the work of maxwell , see @xcite ) : instead of keeping track of each particle , let @xmath99 be the probability density of the distribution of position @xmath37 and velocity @xmath100 of particles at time @xmath101 .",
    "then one can write an evolution equation for @xmath102 , that takes into account the physics of elastic collisions .",
    "it is a nonlinear partial differential equation known as the boltzmann equation : @xmath103 the first term in the right hand side is a linear transport term , while the second term @xmath104 is quadratic in @xmath105 , a double integral actually , and captures the physics of elastic collisions by averaging over all possible input and output velocities ( note here a loss of microscopic information ) .",
    "this equation admits conservation laws .",
    "namely , for every time @xmath106 , @xmath105 is a probability density and the energy of the system is constant ( first principle ) : @xmath107 these constrains define a class of densities @xmath33 on @xmath108 over which the boltzmann entropy @xmath30 achieves its ( gaussian in velocity and uniform in position ) maximum @xmath109 the h - theorem states that the entropy @xmath110 is monotonic along the boltzmann equation : @xmath111 and more precisely , @xmath112 where @xmath33 is the class defined by the conservation law .",
    "a refined analysis gives that @xmath113 in the space - homogeneous simplified case , @xmath105 depends only on the velocity variable , giving a gaussian equilibrium for velocities by maximum entropy ! in kinetic theory of gases , it is customary to call `` maxwellian law '' the standard gaussian law on velocities .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a discussion on the concept of irreversibility and the boltzmann h - theorem .",
    "the work of boltzmann in statistical physics ( nineteenth century ) echoes the works of euler in fluid mechanics ( eighteenth century ) , and of newton in dynamics ( seventeenth century ) . before the modern formalization of probability theory and of partial differential equations with functional analysis , boltzmann , just like euler",
    ", was able to forge a deep concept melting the two !",

    "<S> this text forms the written notes of a talk entitled `` about confined particles with singular pair repulsion '' , given at the occasion of the workshop `` talking across fields '' on convergence to the equilibrium of markov chains . </S>",
    "<S> this workshop was organized in toulouse from 24 to 28 march 2014 by laurent miclo , at the occasion of the cimi excellence research chair for persi diaconis .    </S>",
    "<S> almost ten years ago , we wanted to understand by curiosity the typical global shape of the spectrum of markov transition matrices chosen at random in the polytope of such matrices . </S>",
    "<S> it took us several years to make some progress @xcite , in connection with the circular law phenomenon of girko . </S>",
    "<S> the circular law states that the empirical measure of the eigenvalues of a random @xmath0 matrix , with i.i.d .  </S>",
    "<S> entries of variance @xmath1 , tends to the uniform law on the unit disc of the complex plane , as the dimension @xmath2 tends to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> this universal result was proved rigorously by tao and vu @xcite , after fifty years of contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the proof of this high dimensional phenomenon involves tools from potential theory , from additive combinatorics , and from asymptotic geometric analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the circular law phenomenon can be checked in the gaussian case using the fact that the model is then exactly solvable . </S>",
    "<S> actually , ginibre has shown in the 1960 s that if the entries are i.i.d.centered complex gaussians then the eigenvalues of such matrices form a coulomb gas at temperature @xmath1 in dimension @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn suggests to explore the analogue of the circular law phenomenon in dimension @xmath4 , beyond random matrices . </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to introduce in @xcite stochastic interacting particle systems in which each particle is confined by an external field , and each pair of particles is subject to a singular repulsion . under general assumptions and </S>",
    "<S> suitable scaling , the empirical measure of the particles converges , as the number of particles tends to infinity , to a probability measure that minimizes a natural energy - entropy functional . in the case of quadratic confinement and coulomb repulsion , the limiting law is uniform on a ball .    </S>",
    "<S> this expository text is divided into five sections , written in an informal style . </S>",
    "<S> the first section introduces the boltzmann entropy and h - theorem , and the analogous concept of helmholtz free energy for markov processes . </S>",
    "<S> the second section discusses the shannon monotonicity problem of the boltzmann entropy along the central limit theorem . </S>",
    "<S> the third section introduces voiculescu free probability theory , the free entropy , and the free central limit theorem . </S>",
    "<S> the fourth section discusses the circular law for random matrices drawn from the complex ginibre ensemble , using a large deviations rate function inspired from the voiculescu entropy . </S>",
    "<S> the fifth and last section goes beyond random matrices and studies mean - field particle systems with singular interaction , for which the large deviations rate function is connected to boltzmann and voiculescu entropies .    </S>",
    "<S> talking across fields is rarely an easy task . </S>",
    "<S> you may know for instance that andre andreevitch markov ( 18561922 ) published his seminal article on what we call markov chains in 1906 , and that approximately at the same time , the theory of non - negative matrices was developed by oskar perron ( 18801975 ) and ferdinand georg frobenius ( 18491917 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it took several years to talk across fields , and according to eugene seneta @xcite , the link was made by von mises ( 18831953 ) . </S>",
    "<S> various point of views are available on markov chains . beyond the concreteness of conditional construction and stochastic simulation , </S>",
    "<S> a markov model can always be seen as a deterministic evolution , along the time , of a probability distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanical view of ( random ) nature can be traced back to charles darwin ( 18091882 ) with his mutation - selection evolution theory , and to ludwig boltzmann ( 18441906 ) with his h - theorem in atomistic kinetic theory of gases . </S>",
    "<S> these two great figures of the nineteenth century can be viewed as proto - markovian .    </S>",
