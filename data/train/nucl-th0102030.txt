    "the recent detailed measurement of the elastic differential cross sections of light heavy - ions@xcite have stimulated a revival of the interest in heavy - ion elastic scattering as a useful tool to obtain a better understanding of nuclear properties .",
    "deep real parts and shallow imaginary ones characterise the optical potentials used to reproduce these experimental cross sections .",
    "the reduced absorption , that seems necessary to reproduce the observed data , makes the cross section sensitive to contributions coming from the internal region of the interaction , allowing the study of the interaction properties in regions where the densities of the two nuclei strongly overlap .",
    "the number of partial waves that contribute to these optical potential cross sections is in all these cases rather large .",
    "this allows one to hope that semiclassical techniques can be used to connect the behavior of the cross sections , in certain angular ranges , to the properties of the interaction , in some corresponding spatial region .",
    "the recognition of the presence of classical - like contributions in an experimental cross section may be a very difficult job , but at least in principle , their determination in an optical potential cross section should be easier . here",
    "the problem is in fact reduced to performing a semiclassical analysis of the optical potential cross section .    the classical limit of scattering by a real potential is well understood since",
    "more then fourty years@xcite .",
    "this limit is found with the use of asymptotic approximations for the scattering function @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , for the legendre polynomials @xmath3 , and for the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude @xmath4 . as a result",
    "one obtains that @xmath4 can be expressed in terms of one , or more , stationary phase contributions .",
    "the square modulus of each stationary phase contribution exactly coincides with a corresponding contribution from one branch of the classical deflection function . because each stationary point contribution has also a phase , if two or more stationary points contribute to @xmath4 in some angular range , oscillations appear in the cross section arising from interference .",
    "these oscillations disappear in the classical limit by averaging over the finite resolution of the experimental devices .",
    "unfortunately this simple scheme can not , in general , be applied to the optical potentials commonly used to describe the elastic scattering of two heavy - ions . in the scattering process from the optical potentials currently used ( also neglecting the complications arising from the presence in the interaction of an imaginary part ) the classical integral actions , in units of @xmath0 , are large but not infinite and quantum contributions , superimposed to classical - like ones , survive in the scattering function and in the corresponding cross section . only in the extreme classical limit",
    "these quantum contributions are expected to disappear , remaining confined in regions whose width go to zero .",
    "several semiclassical methods@xcite were developed to extend the range of application of the classical description to the dynamical regions in which an imaginary part is present in the potential and the extreme classical conditions are not fully satisfied .",
    "these methods considerably extend the possibility of describing the semiclassical properties of a scattering process . however , presently , they predict cross sections in good quantitative agreement with the exactly calculated ones only in certain energy ranges , depending on the optical potential considered .    furthermore , also admitting that we are within the range of validity of some of the available semiclassical methods , their application to practical cases is slightly more difficult , and much less popular , than the direct calculation of the exact cross section .",
    "owing to this , one could ask if some trick exists , which is able to provide quickly a useful indication on the classical - like nature of some properties of a cross section , without worrying about the complications of the semiclassical techniques and about their ranges of validity .    in this paper one of these possible tricks",
    "is investigated .",
    "the base idea is that the classical - like properties must not depend on @xmath0 . owing to this all the properties of a cross section which do not depend on the value which is attributed to @xmath0 , in the framework of a quantum calculation ,",
    "can be considered of classical origin .",
    "the main ingredients of this simple recipe , which can be easlily implemented in any standard optical potential code , are presented in sect .",
    "ii . in order to test the method in a simple case , in sect .",
    "iii we present the results obtained for a real optical potential . in sect .",
    "iv and v the method is applied to analyze the behavior of two optical potential cross sections , fitted to the experimental data of @xmath5o + @xmath6c at the laboratory energies of 132 and 200 mev@xcite .    for the cases considered ,",
    "the results of the quantum calculation are first compared with the corresponding classical ones .",
    "this comparison is not really necessary for the application of the recipe and is introduced here only to show the reliability of the method to identify correctly classical - like properties .",
    "the results obtained are that the qualitative behavior of the optical potential cross sections smoothly changes with varying @xmath0 .",
    "considering the oscillations which appear in the cross section as arising from the interference between simpler amplitudes , one observes that with decreasing values of @xmath0 some of these amplitudes continue to modify their behavior , contributing to angular ranges of decreasing width , while others become insensitive on any further decrease of @xmath0 .",
    "the former reveal their quantum origin , the latter their classical nature .",
    "the comparison of the behavior of the real cross section ( calculated with the true value of @xmath0 ) with that of the fictitious cross sections ( calculated attributing to @xmath0 values sufficiently small ) allows one to obtain easy indications on the classical - like properties of the true cross section .",
    "accordingly to classical mechanics , the cross section for scattering from a potential @xmath7 is completely determined by the deflection function    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10are , respectively , the angular and linear momenta , and @xmath11 is the turning point which delimitates from below the classically accessible region of the radial motion .    the deflection angle @xmath12 is connected to the scattering angle @xmath13 through the relation    @xmath14.\\ ] ]    remembering that @xmath15 for @xmath16 , if @xmath12 is a monotonous function and @xmath17 , the differential cross section is given by    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the inverse function of @xmath13 .    if the above conditions are not satisfied , particles with different angular momenta can be scattered at the same scattering angle .",
    "this happens when critical @xmath20 values exist at which the deflection function has maxima or minima , or crosses the values @xmath21 , @xmath22 . in this case",
    "@xmath13 can be inverted only within intervals limited by two consecutive critical @xmath20 values , corresponding to different branches of the deflection function , and the cross section is given by    @xmath23    where the sum runs over all the branches of the deflection function containing a deflection angle corresponding to the scattering angle @xmath24 .    accordingly to quantum mechanics , the cross section for scattering from a potential @xmath7 is completely determined by the scattering function @xmath1 .",
    "this quantity defines the scattering amplitude    @xmath25 p_{\\lambda-\\frac{1}{2}}(\\cos \\theta),\\ ] ]    and the cross section @xmath26 , which is the square modulus of @xmath4 .",
    "the classical limit of the quantum cross section is realized through the appearance of a link between @xmath1 and @xmath12 .",
    "these two quantities are in fact connected by the relation    @xmath27    thanks to this link , the classical mechanics expression for the cross section is recovered using the asymptotic expansion for the legendre polynomials , transforming the partial wave expansion into a sum of integrals , and evaluating asymptotically these integrals using the stationary phase method .",
    "the properties of the deflection function fix the number of the stationary phase points which contribute to @xmath4 at each angle .",
    "the contribution from each stationary phase point has a modulus , whose square just coincides with the classical expression , and a phase .",
    "the phase factors produce an oscillatory behavior in the cross section in the angular regions where two , or more , stationary phase points contribute , and the classical result is finally obtained only after averaging over these oscillations , whose period goes to 0 in the classical limit , to account for the finite resolution of the experimental devices .    owing to this",
    ", a signature of the contribution of classical - like trajectories is the presence in the angular distribution of angular intervals in which the cross section , changing the value attributed to @xmath0 , either does not change or , if it changes , keeps as upper and lower envelopes the curves corresponding to the maximal constructive and destructive interference amongst all the contributions from the different branches of the deflection function . in the following these envelopes and the delimitated region",
    "will be named _ interference limits _ and _ interference region _ , respectively .",
    "the interference limits can be calculated starting from the properties of @xmath12 , or they can be found by performing a quantum mechanics calculation by attributing to @xmath0 different values , sufficiently smaller than the physical value .",
    "this scheme is well suited to bring out classical like - contributions in the cross section for scattering by a real potential , but it can not be directly applied to the cases in which an imaginary part is introduced in the interaction to simulate the effects of the population of channels different from the elastic one .",
    "the imaginary part @xmath28 of the potential removes flux from the elastic channel and the time dependence of the probability density , @xmath29 , of finding the scattering partners at time @xmath30 at a relative position @xmath31 satisfies the equation@xcite    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the probability current density .",
    "the above equation suggests the interpretation of the quantity @xmath34 as the probability per unit of time for a transition out of the elastic channel .    with this interpretation of @xmath35 the form of the classical cross section given by eq .",
    "[ mulclasez ] remains the same , apart for the introduction , in each term on the r.h.s , of a multiplicative factor    @xmath36    expressing the probability that the particles with angular momentum @xmath37 are not removed from the elastic channel during their motion along the classical trajectory .",
    "we note , in passing , that this form for the cross section is just that obtained using the naive wkb approximation@xcite to estimate @xmath1 , and the stationary phase method to evaluate @xmath4 . within this scheme",
    "the probability that the particles with angular momentum @xmath37 are not removed from the elastic channel can be identified with @xmath38 , which has exactly the dependence from the imaginary part of the potential deriving from the above classical interpretation .    in accordance with this picture , in the search process of the interference limits based on the variation of the value attributed to @xmath0 ( in order to keep constant the survival probability factor ) the imaginary potential",
    "must be scaled with the same factor used for @xmath0 .",
    "this will be the additional caution used to look for traces of classical - like contributions in the quantum mechanics cross section .",
    "apart from in the cross section , traces of classical - like contributions can also be found in the behavior of @xmath39 and of @xmath40 . in the following this last quantity",
    "will be named _ quantum deflection function _ and indicated with @xmath41 .    if the classical limit is well approached both @xmath39 and @xmath41 are expected not to depend on the value of @xmath0 , if plotted versus the impact parameter @xmath42 .",
    "the conventional optical potential codes provide the values of @xmath1 for half integer positive @xmath20 values .",
    "these values can be used directly to plot @xmath39 versus the impact parameter @xmath43 , and using the finite difference formula    @xmath44    with @xmath45 , they often also provide a reasonable approximation for @xmath41 at integer @xmath20 values . in the cases here",
    "considered , for a very few @xmath46 values , this simple approximation provides a bad estimate for @xmath41 .",
    "this happens when the true variation of @xmath47 , between consecutive integer @xmath46 values , becomes larger than @xmath48 .",
    "it is due to the fact that , in the optical code that we use , the arguments of @xmath1 are defined modulus @xmath49 and the angle @xmath50 between two successive @xmath1 values , in the complex argand plane , is taken as the convex one . only for an extreme precaution , in the present work , the quantity @xmath41 was estimated , outside our conventional optical code , using eq .",
    "[ quadef ] with a step @xmath51 for @xmath52 and of @xmath53 elsewhere .",
    "the fact that the values of @xmath39 and @xmath41 , calculated with different values of @xmath0 and plotted against @xmath43 , lie on the same curve can be considered a signature of the dominance of a classical - like mechanism in the scattering process .",
    "however this fact , alone , does not guarantee that the cross section also closely follows the behavior predicted by the classical mechanism .",
    "the realization of the classical limit for the cross section also requires that the integrals , in which the partial wave expansion of @xmath4 is transformed , can be approximated by the stationary phase method and that , at the stationary phase points , the legendre functions are well approximated by their non - uniform asymptotic expansions .",
    "it is well known that the stationary phase method fails in a neighbourhood of the classical rainbow angles and that the uniform method allows an estimation of the contributions from the stationary points in terms of airy functions .",
    "the uniform approximation substitutes the singularity of the classical cross section , followed by the sharp shadow region , with a maximum in the lit region followed by a decrease of the cross section . in the approach to the classical limit the maximum moves towards the rainbow angle , and the cross section very rapidly decreases in the shadow region .",
    "therefore in general deviations are expected between the behavior of the quantum and the classical cross sections around the classical rainbow scattering angles .",
    "deviations are also expected in the extreme backward direction where the usual non - uniform approximation for the legendre functions does not hold .",
    "this approximation is responsible for the presence of the factor @xmath54 in the classical limit of the cross section and , consequently , for the appearance of the classical glory singularity .",
    "these types of deviations , thypical of quantum effects , are however standard and one can easily recognize their presence in the search process of classical - like properties of the cross sections .",
    "to test the effectiveness of the method based on the variation of @xmath0 , we first consider the cross section of a fictitious real optical potential having a conventional woods - saxon form factor with parameters @xmath55 mev , @xmath56 fm and @xmath57 fm .",
    "this potential is the real part of one of those used for fitting the elastic scattering cross section of @xmath5o + @xmath6c at @xmath58 mev@xcite .",
    "for all the cases here considered , the coulomb part of the interaction is described using an analytical potential that closely approximates the coulomb potential of two uniformly charged spheres with radii of 3.54 fm and 3.17 fm .      the thick solid line in fig .",
    "1 shows the classical deflection function @xmath12 , as a function of the impact parameter @xmath43 .",
    "this line , as similar ones for the other cases considered , shows the cubic spline interpolation of the @xmath12 values calculated at @xmath42 , with a step @xmath59 , starting from @xmath60 .",
    "the open dots in fig . 1 show the values of @xmath41 estimated by using eq .",
    "[ quadef ] at integer @xmath20 values , and the thin curve gives the cubic spline interpolation of the calculated points .",
    "[ fig1 ]    the agreement between the dots and the thick curve is impressive and the small differences between the thin and the thick lines may be a consequence of the method used to interpolate the dots .",
    "the classical deflection function shows a maximum of about @xmath61 at @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) and a minimum of about @xmath64 at @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) . in the classical cross section",
    "we therefore expect two rainbow singularities at the scattering angles @xmath67 ( coulomb rainbow ) and @xmath68 ( nuclear rainbow ) .",
    "six different branches of @xmath12 contribute to the cross section , four corresponding to trajectories coming from the scattering half plane containing the scattering angle ( near - side trajectories ) and two coming from the opposite half plane ( far - side trajectories ) .    at @xmath69 , the deflection function @xmath12 crosses three times values for which @xmath70 .",
    "two glory singularities are expected at @xmath71 and one , additional to the coulomb singularity , at @xmath72 .    in the panel ( a ) of fig.2",
    "the thick line shows the ratio of the classical mechanics cross section to the rutherford one .",
    "the thin solid and dashed lines give the contributions to the same quantity from the different branches , near- and far - side respectively , of the deflection function .",
    "the appearance of the rainbow singularities are manifest , as are the glory singularities corresponding to the crossing of the deflection function of the @xmath73 deflection angle .",
    "the glory corresponding to the crossing of the @xmath74 deflection angle is masked by the rutherford cross section higher order singularity at the same scattering angle .    in the semiclassical limit a phase factor",
    "is associated to each contribution from the different branches of the deflection function . in the panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "2 the thin solid lines show the interference limits of these contributions , while the thick dashed and solid lines give , respectively , the classical and the quantum cross sections .",
    "[ fig2 ]    with the exclusion of a small angular range at the right of @xmath75 , the oscillations appearing in the quantum cross section are well within the interference region .",
    "the interference limits can not , however , be considered the upper and lower envelopes of the quantum cross section .",
    "the reason for this is clarified in the panels ( c ) and ( d ) of the same figure , where the thick solid and dashed lines show the near- and far - side components of the quantum@xcite and classical cross sections , respectively .",
    "the interference limits of the classical far - side cross section are almost perfect envelopes of the quantum far - side cross section .",
    "the period of the oscillations of this cross section decreases with the increase of the scattering angle , which corresponds to a decrease of the deflection angle .",
    "this tendency is confirmed by the very long period of the oscillation appearing in the backward angles near - side cross section .",
    "owing to this , the oscillations can be interpreted as arising from interference of classical - like trajectories whose phase differences tend to decrease while approaching the nuclear rainbow angular momentum . in the present case , these phase differences are too small to allow us to observe the maximal constructive and destructive interference amongst all the four branches of the deflection function contributing to angles larger than @xmath76 .    in the classical near - side cross section",
    "a dark region is present between @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "from both the shadow boundaries , this dark region appears partially enlightened by the quantum near - side cross section , and the tails of the two shadows overlap with each other producing some interference .",
    "the shadow contribution to the right of @xmath75 decreases rather rapidly .",
    "this makes difficult to justify , as arising from this contribution , the persistence of the interference pattern in the near - side cross section at angles larger than about @xmath77 . in this angular range ,",
    "the oscillations suggest the existence of an additional non - classical contribution .",
    "the near- and far - side cross section interference patterns are considerably simpler than the full cross section one .",
    "this complicate interference pattern of the full cross section arises from the coherent superposition of the simpler far- and near - side amplitudes .",
    "it is the folding of the plane of fig .",

    "[ fig3 ]    the unfolded quantum curve shows an irregular behavior in a small angular interval around @xmath73 .",

    ", one can however appreciate the attempt of the near - side curve ( @xmath80 ) to match continuously the far - side one ( @xmath81 ) .    the comparison of @xmath41 with @xmath12 , and of the quantum cross sections ( full , near- and far - side ) with the corresponding classical ones , allows one to recognize the presence , in the quantum quantities , of contributions which are very close to those expected from classical - like trajectories .",
    "a nice airy - like pattern appears in the unfolded quantum cross section .",
    "the increase of the period of the main oscillations , with decreasing the deflection angle , well justifies the fact that the interference limits are rather far from representing the envelopes of the full quantum cross section .",
    "the comparison of the classical and quantum cross sections allows one to derive clear evidences of classical - like characteristics in the quantum cross section .",

    "this tendency begins to appear in the inset ( b ) , where a rather well defined upper envelope can be observed , and also indications of a lower envelope are present .",
    "one explanation of the minor definiteness of the lower envelope can be found in the fact that , with the scale used , the minima are much narrows than the maxima . using a fixed grid to tabulate the cross section it is more probable to miss a minimum rather than a maximum .    in the angular region",

    "the rapidity of the decrease of the cross section , in the classical shadow region , depends on the second derivative of the deflection function at the rainbow angular momentum .",
    "the curvature of the deflection function is much higher at the nuclear than at the coulomb rainbow , and this explains why the two slopes are so different .    comparing the inset ( a ) of fig .",

    "the quantum curve decreases almost exponentially , at the rate of about one order of magnitude per @xmath104 , filling the classical shadow region between @xmath75 and @xmath76 . by increasing the angle ,",
    "oscillations of increasing amplitudes appear , indicating the interference of the exponentially decreasing contribution with another one .    in the backward hemisphere , decreasing the angle below @xmath79 , the quantum near - side curve",
    "initially follows the classical one , then it begins to show oscillations with an amplitude increasing with decreasing angle .",
    "these oscillations can be interpreted as arising from the interference of a classical - like contribution with a different contribution , of non - classical origin .",
    "this additional contribution appears to be the same producing the oscillations in the exponential tail at the right of @xmath75 .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively similar to that observed in the near - side cross section of the real potential .",
    "the only difference is represented by the fact that now the curves at the right of @xmath76 are downward shifted and decrease more rapidly by decreasing the angle .",
    "this allows one to observe in a wider angular range the exponential decrease at the right of @xmath75 .",
    "the quantum and classical far - side cross sections given in the panel ( d ) show that a relevant contribution to the violation of the classical interference limits comes also from at least one of the two terms responsible for the oscillatory pattern of the quantum far - side cross section .",
    "this confirms the results obtained with the semiclassical analysis@xcite , suggesting that one of these contributions is not of classical origin .",
    "the panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "10 show , respectively , @xmath39 and @xmath41 for the four values of @xmath93 given in the figure . by increasing @xmath93 from 0.5 to 2.0 ,",
    "all the points tend to lie on the same curve in increasing ranges of @xmath43 .    comparing the behavior of the points representing @xmath41 with the corresponding ones for the real potential",
    "one observes that the imaginary part of the potential delays the approach of the classical limit .",
    "the addition of an imaginary part increases the non - homogeneity of the medium in which the particles propagate and favors the survival of wave effects .",
    "[ fig10 ]    it is interesting to observe that , for @xmath88 and @xmath43 larger then about 4 fm , @xmath41 has characteristics typical of a repulsive interaction .",
    "these are similar to those of the deflection function of the barrier term of the brink and takigawa approximation , which accounts for the contribution from the reflection phenomenon of the incoming waves in the region of rapid variation of the properties of the interaction .",
    "the variations with @xmath93 of the full , near- and far - side cross sections are shown in figs .",
    "11 , 12 , and 13 , respectively .    in these figures",
    "the curves corresponding to the values of @xmath93 from 0.5 to 2.0 are rather far from having common envelopes . in the backward hemisphere and for the full and far - side cross sections ,",
    "these common evelopes only begin to appear for the curves with @xmath105 and @xmath106 . on the contrary , the existence of a well defined interference region is clearly shown by the calculations with values of @xmath93 from 3.0 to 4.0 , given in insets ( b ) .",
    "thanks to the rapid decrease of the near - side cross section , by decreasing the angle below @xmath79 , the boundaries of the interference region are far better defined for the complex potential full cross section than for the real potential one .",
    "the addition of the imaginary part to the optical potential has strongly increased the average slope of the backward near - side cross section and has considerably reduced , or perhaps eliminated , the long period oscillations appearing in the inset ( b ) of fig .",
    "both these facts contribute to a better definition of the interference region for the complex optical potential full cross section .",
    "[ fig11 ]    [ fig12 ]    [ fig13 ]    the interference region , obtained using a pure quantum calculation , is just the one previously calculated using the classical mechanics .",
    "this shows that the analysis of the nature of the different contributions to the cross section can be done in absence of any classical mechanics calculation .",
    "the presence of at least one classical - like contribution in the far - side cross section is proved by the behavior of the cross section at backward angles , and by its continuation , passing through the glory singularity , in the near - side cross section at backward angle . at forward angles ,",
    "the violation of the interference limits confirms the non - classical origin of the other contribution , responsible for the oscillatory pattern in the far - side cross section .    in the classical near - side shadow region ,",
    "the existence of an approximately constant contribution to the quantum cross section is clearly displayed by the dashed and dotted curves of fig .",
    "this is the contribution which is responsible for the appearance of oscillations around the exponential drop of the near - side cross section at the right of @xmath75 , and around the classical - like contribution in the backward hemisphere .",
    "we did not attempted to investigate whether this contribution arises from some physical fact of from the numerical procedure used to calculate the cross sections .",
    "the second complex optical potential considered is one of the potentials whose cross section fits the experimental data at @xmath108 mev@xcite .",
    "this potential also has conventional woods - saxon form factors with parameters @xmath109 mev , @xmath110 fm , @xmath111 fm , for the real part , and @xmath112 mev , @xmath113 fm , and @xmath114 fm for the imaginary part .    this case",
    "was considered because an analysis similar to that of ref.@xcite shows that the semiclassical brink and takigawa method fails to reproduce quantitatively the optical cross section in the whole angular range .",
    "the results of the semiclassical analysis are summarized in fig .",
    "14 , where the medium and heavy solid lines show the full semiclassical and the exact cross sections , respectively , while the thin solid and dashed lines show the barrier and the internal cross sections . in the inset ( a )",
    "the corresponding far - side cross sections are shown .",
    "[ fig14 ]    the agreement between the semiclassical and the exact cross sections in rather good only for scattering angles smaller then about @xmath115 . as for the @xmath116 mev case , in this region the oscillations appearing in the exact far - side cross section can be explained as arising from the interference between far - side contributions from the barrier and the internal amplitudes .",
    "this casts doubts on the appropriateness of the use of the airy terminology for the interference pattern for the @xmath117 mev potential .    at angles larger than @xmath118 , however , the semiclassical and the exact cross sections are in large disagreement and this disagreement suggests caution in attributing a physical meaning to the semiclassical analysis .",
    "the reason of the failure of the brink and takigawa approximation is probably connected with the fact that the case here considered is outside the range of applicability of the method . for this potential the complex orbiting angular momentum at which the barrier turning points coalesce is far from the real @xmath20 axis . on the contrary",
    "a different orbiting angular momentum is very close to the physical region .",
    "this is the angular momentum at which the internal turning point coalesces with a turning point different from those usually considered in the brink and takigawa approximation .",
    "this orbiting point , not treated correctly by the approximation , may be responsible for the anomalous behavior of the semiclassical cross sections .",
    "the hope is that the present recipe can provide some useful and more clear indications on the nature of the amplitudes contributing to the cross section of this potential .      in fig .",
    "15 the classical @xmath12 and @xmath119 are shown together with the corresponding quantum quantities .",
    "with respect to the 132 mev case , the minimum of the deflection function corresponding to the nuclear rainbow has moved to a deflection angle @xmath120 .    because the nuclear rainbow singularity slids@xcite toward a deflection angle larger then @xmath73 , the backward glory singularities are suppressed , and only four branches of the deflection function contribute to the cross section .",
    "the panels of fig .",
    "16 show that , in this case , the regions to the right of the coulomb rainbow @xmath75 ( for the near - side cross section ) and to the right of the nuclear rainbow @xmath76 ( for the far - side and the full cross sections ) are classical shadow regions .",
    "[ fig15 ]    the quantities @xmath41 and @xmath39 are in substantial agreement with the corresponding classical ones in @xmath43 ranges wider than for the 132 mev case",
    ". however , the violations of the interference limits of the quantum full and far - side cross sections , shown in the panels ( b ) and ( d ) of fig.16 , are not smaller than in the lower energy case . for angles smaller than about @xmath121",
    "the far - side quantum cross section is largely outside of the classical interference region .",
    "this suggests that also for this potential , as for the 132 mev case , these oscillations can not be interpreted as arising from the interference between two classical - like contributions .",
    "[ fig16 ]    in panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "16 we clearly see the contribution from an almost constant additional term , which interferes with the exponential - like decrease of the cross section to the right of @xmath75 .",
    "it is more evident than in the corresponding panel of fig .",
    "9 , where its presence was barely apparent , in the backward hemisphere , through its interference with the near - side classical - like contribution in this region .      for the 200 mev potential ,",
    "the figures from 17 to 20 correspond to the figures from 10 to 13 , for the 132 mev case . by comparing fig .",
    "17 with fig .",
    "10 one observes that , by decreasing @xmath0 , the properties of @xmath1 approach of the classical limit faster in the higher energy case .",
    "this is true also for the properties of the cross sections , and depends on the fact that for the higher energy the wavelength is smaller .",
    "in particular , by looking at fig .",
    "18 and fig .",
    "20 one observes that the quantum curves begin to have as upper and lower envelopes the interference limits , for scattering angles around @xmath121 , already with a @xmath0 reducing factor of 1.5 . from this value",
    "upward the interference pattern , below the classical nuclear rainbow angle , can be considered a genuine airy - like pattern .",
    "[ fig17 ]    [ fig18 ]    in the inset ( b ) of figs .",
    "18 and 20 , one again observes that the quantum calculations with @xmath93 values ranging from 3.0 to 4.0 , very well define the classical interference region , apart from problems connected with the quantum illumination of the classical shadow regions .",
    "also in this case , the good definition of the interference region allows one the test the classical origin of the different amplitudes contributing to the quantum cross section by using only the calculations of a standard optical potential code .    in the forward hemisphere , the values of the true far - side cross section largely violates the classical interference limits .",
    "this confirms the inappropriateness of using the rainbow terminology for the interference patterns appearing in this and in the full cross sections .",
    "[ fig19 ]    [ fig20 ]    figure 19 shows that , as in the previous case , the behavior of the near - side cross section in the classical shadow region is largely responsible for the violation of the interference limits of the full cross section .    in the inset ( b ) of the same figure one can observe that , for @xmath93 values from 3.0 to 4.0 and for @xmath122 , the almost constant contribution to the near - side cross section is outside the plotted area .",
    "only the rapidly decreasing exponential contribution appears in a restricted angular range above @xmath75 .",
    "the simple recipe of shrinking @xmath0 , in a conventional optical potential calculation , provides useful information on the nature of the different amplitudes contributing to the cross section .    by decreasing @xmath0",
    "the different characteristics of the cross section smoothly change , with different rapidity . in the major part of the angular interval , below some @xmath0 value",
    ", no further changes are observed in the cross sections with decreasing @xmath0 , apart from the sliding of the interference pattern within well defined regions , with an increasing number of oscillations .",
    "these are the characteristics connected with the realization of the transition from the dynamical regime governed by the quantum mechanics rules to that governed by classical mechanics ones",
    ".      the possibility of producing optical potential cross sections , attributing different values to @xmath0 , can also be used as a laboratory which provides useful cross sections for testing the effectiveness of the semiclassical techniques currently used .    as one example of the tests that could be performed",
    "let us consider the 132 mev case .",
    "following the brink and takigawa approximation , in this case the oscillations appearing in the far side cross section arise from the interference between the far - side contributions to the barrier and the internal amplitudes@xcite .",
    "a similar result has also been obtained@xcite ( with an approximate calculation@xcite of the barrier and internal amplitudes ) for the same and for several other optical potentials used to describe the elastic scattering of light heavy - ions .",
    "the results obatained in all these cases show that the barrier far - side contribution is responsible for the fraunhofer - like pattern appearing in the barrier cross section , and this strongly suggests that it must be regarded as a diffractive contribution .",
    "the present analysis shows that by decreasing the value of @xmath0 this contribution smoothly changes , until it assumes a form which must be identified with the contribution from classical - like far - side trajectories .    in the brink and takigawa approximation the contribution from these trajectories",
    "should be contained in the internal term , and this implies that a critical @xmath0 range exists in which the contribution migrates from the barrier to the internal term .",
    "this migration is probably connected with the change of the characteristics of the trajectories described in the complex @xmath123 plane by the turning points of the radial equation .    in this critical region ,",
