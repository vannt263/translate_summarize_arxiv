    "extreme densities and temperatures can be achieved during the highly energetic core - collapse explosion of a type ib supernova .",
    "in fact , temperatures of tens of mev ( @xmath0mev@xmath1k ) and densities as high as @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the nuclear saturation density ) can be attained right after the bounce , when the proto neutron star is still hot and lepton - rich .",
    "in general , sn simulations show that the highest central density achieved in the early post - bounce phase is higher than the nuclear saturation density @xmath3 , but hardly higher than @xmath2 . on the other hand , the equation of state ( eos ) for strongly interacting matter at low temperature and high baryon density",
    "possibly presents a first order hadron - quark phase transition at the same density scale .",
    "moreover , it has been recently shown @xcite that if there is a hadron - quark phase transition in the early post - bounce phase of a core - collapse supernova , it may be decisive for the supernova explosion . a natural question that arises",
    "is whether the qcd phase transition may happen or not during an actual supernova .",
    "the most important condition is , at least in principle , achievable : the critical density for the transition may be lower than the densities found during the early post - bounce phase ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "however , this condition is not enough for the phase transition to happen , once it takes a finite time to be initiated and completed , and such time must be shorter than a typical time scale of the sn evolution ( which we assume to be @xmath5 ms ) @xcite .",
    "this is the central subject of this work .    by calculating the formation rate of quark matter bubbles at given physical conditions , we estimate ( or , rather , underestimate ) the time scale associated with the phase transition and",
    "compare it to the duration of the pre - deleptonization era in a core - collapse supernova @xmath6 .",
    "this comparison can serve as a criterium of feasibility for the formation of quark matter in this scenario , because the process of nucleation must occur inside the time window determined by @xmath6 .",
    "we discuss the formation of two possible quark phases in the phase transition . in the first case ,",
    "the phase conversion involves two - flavor quark matter . in the second scenario",
    ", we consider a fast production of strange quarks : since we assume critical densities for the phase transition ( @xmath7 ) of the order of two times the saturation density and temperatures of a few tens of mev , it is possible that a small seed of strange matter is already present in the system as hyperons and kaons appear @xcite .",
    "such particles do not contribute significantly to the pressure or to the energy density in the hadronic phase , but their presence may trigger a phase transition directly to strange quark matter .    to encompass both possibilities for the quark matter phase ,",
    "we consider two types of high - density eos , both including the pressure from electrons and neutrinos , which are still present at the early post - bounce phase . in the first case , we consider only @xmath8 and @xmath9 quarks , while in the second we also include a massive @xmath10 quark .",
    "the free parameters of the quark model are the bag constant @xmath11 , the mass of the strange quark @xmath12 ( when present ) , and the coefficient @xmath13 @xcite , that effectively accounts for perturbative qcd corrections to the free gas pressure @xcite , as follows ( terms @xmath14 were neglected ) : @xmath15                  + ( 1-c ) \\frac{\\mu_s^4}{4\\pi^2 } - \\frac{3}{4\\pi^2}m_s^2\\mu_s^2                 + \\frac{\\mu_e^4}{12\\pi^2}+\\frac{\\mu_\\nu^4}{24\\pi^2 } - b\\ ] ] for nuclear matter , we adopt the relativistic mean field model equation of state with the tm1 parametrization @xcite , often used in supernovae simulations .",
    "the equations of state for nuclear matter and quark matter are calculated under conditions of local charge neutrality , local lepton fraction conservation ( i.e. , the two phases have the same @xmath16 ) , and weak equilibrium . under these assumptions ,",
    "the conditions of phase equilibrium are the equality of the total pressure of the two phases @xmath17 and condition of chemical equilibrium @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the chemical potentials of neutron and neutrinos within the nuclear phase , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the chemical potentials of up and down quarks and of neutrinos within the quark phase , respectively @xcite .. ] finally , the conditions of local charge neutrality and local conservation of the lepton fraction allow us to compute all chemical potentials in terms of one independent chemical potential ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .      in first - order phase transitions , if a homogeneous system is brought into instability close enough to the coexistence line of the phase diagram , its dynamics will be dominated by large - amplitude , small - ranged fluctuations , that is , by bubbles of the metastable phase , which eventually grow and complete the phase conversion @xcite .",
    "the standard theory of thermal nucleation in one - component metastable systems was developed by langer in the late sixties @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in this formalism ,",
    "a key quantity for the calculation of the rate of nucleation is the coarse - grained free energy functional , that may be cast , in the vicinity of the phase transition , as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the surface tension of the hadron - quark interface . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaf ] ) , we can see that @xmath26 has a maximum at @xmath27 , the critical radius .",
    "the bubbles of this size are called _ critical bubbles _ and are the smallest bubbles that , once formed , can start to drive the phase conversion . therefore , to give a quantitative meaning to the process of nucleation , one can calculate the rate @xmath28 of critical bubbles created by fluctuations per unit volume , per unit time : @xmath29           = t^4 \\,\\exp\\left[-\\frac{16\\pi}{3}\\frac{\\sigma^3}{(\\delta p)^2 t}\\right],\\ ] ] where we used ( [ eq : deltaf ] ) and @xmath30 .",
    "we make the simple choice @xmath31 , which is an overestimate of the actual pre - factor .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite . ]",
    "notice also that the influence of the equation of state is present through @xmath32 . finally , there is a remarkably strong dependence of @xmath28 on the surface tension @xmath25 , which will be determinant for the nucleation time scale .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the _ nucleation time _",
    "@xmath33 , defined as the time it takes for the nucleation of one single critical bubble inside a volume of @xmath34 in the proto - neutron star core : @xmath35 .",
    "this is the time scale we compare with the duration of the early post - bounce phase of a supernova event , few hundreds of milliseconds , during which the formation of quark matter could trigger the supernova explosion .",
    "as our first case , we consider the transition from beta - stable nuclear matter to beta - stable quark matter composed of @xmath36 and @xmath37 quarks , plus electrons and electron neutrinos , with a fixed lepton fraction @xmath38 and critical baryon density @xmath39 .",
    "figure 1 shows the behaviour of the nucleation time of a single critical bubble ( as defined in the previous section ) versus the density , in units of @xmath3 .",
    "as expected , the nucleation time @xmath33 has an extremely strong dependence on both the density ( notice the logarithmic scale for @xmath33 ) and on the surface tension . as discussed in the introduction , we consider that nucleation is effective if @xmath40 ms for @xmath41",
    ". for low values of @xmath25 , nucleation becomes feasible at relatively low densities , although the required densities increase steadily as the surface tension rises .",
    "next , we compare the previously analyzed @xmath42 case with @xmath43 , in the case of @xmath39 and @xmath44 mev , as displayed in figure 2 , where we also show the influence of the lepton fraction @xmath16 . the contour lines of figs . 2 - 4 ( on which the nucleation time is @xmath45 ms ) may be considered as `` nucleation thresholds '' : given a value of surface tension , when the rising density crosses one contour line , the nucleation time scale is fast enough for the completion of the phase conversion .",
    "notice that the introduction of interactions drastically increases the nucleation time , so that only for a low value of the surface tension nucleation can be efficient as the density reaches a value close to @xmath2 .",
    "for cold dense matter is called for . ] furthermore , notice that given a fixed density , a decrease in @xmath16 makes nucleation more efficient , because deleptonization renders nuclear matter less stable .",
    "( from @xcite .",
    ") lines of constant nucleation time ( @xmath45ms ) as a function of @xmath46 and @xmath25 with noninteracting ( @xmath42 ) and interacting ( @xmath43 ) u - d quarks , for @xmath47 and @xmath38 .",
    "the introduction of strange quarks makes the eos stiffer , i.e. , for a given baryon chemical potential @xmath48 the corresponding pressure becomes higher .",
    "once the nuclear eos is the same , @xmath32 will be higher for a given value of @xmath48 , and the nucleation rate will also be higher .",
    "figure 3 shows a comparison between the transition from nuclear matter to either u - d or u - d - s quark matter for two values of the lepton fraction @xmath16 ( @xmath39 , @xmath49mev , @xmath42 and @xmath50 ) .",
    "as previously discussed , we can notice that in the present case a decrease in @xmath16 also increases the efficiency of thermal nucleation .",
    "we can also analyze the effect of the strange quark mass on the nucleation time .",
    "this can be seen in figure 4 , which also shows how the combined effect of the strange quark mass and of ( perturbative ) strong interactions can strongly increase the nucleation time ( @xmath39 , @xmath49mev and @xmath38 ) .",
    "notice that the presence of interactions among quarks suggest that the value of @xmath25 should not exceed @xmath51 mev/@xmath52 ( with the realistic value @xmath53 mev ) , if we require nucleation to be efficient .",
    "we investigated the possibility of formation of quark matter in supernova matter , i.e. , for temperatures of the order of a few tens of mev and in the presence of trapped neutrinos , assuming that the corresponding critical density does not exceed @xmath54 . by calculating the nucleation rate for different values of the free parameters",
    ", we argued that thermal nucleation of droplets of the quark phase is possibly the dominant mechanism for the formation of the new phase .    as expected from eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaf ] ) , the surface tension is the physical quantity which mainly controls the nucleation process and , within our choices of physical conditions ( for the eos we tested ) , the value of @xmath25 should not exceed @xmath55mev/@xmath52 if the hadron - quark phase transition in core - collapse supernovae occurs via thermal nucleation .",
