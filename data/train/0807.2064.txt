    "most stars in the galactic disk are formed in dense molecular gas within giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) as members of clusters ( lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "thus , clusters must play a critical role in the origins of some of the most fundamental properties of the galactic stellar population .",
    "in addition , such clusters consist of stars of various masses , and the most massive stars exist at the centers of clusters ( e.g. , raboud & mermilliod 1998 ) .",
    "these features suggest that the physical environment in the cluster - forming region would vary from area to area because the mass of formed stars should be closely related to the physical environment .",
    "however , clusters do not always include massive stars .",
    "some clusters contain only intermediate - mass and/or low - mass stars in low - mass star - forming regions ( e.g. , tachihara et al .",
    "2002 ) . based on these features",
    ", it appears that although the conditions of massive star formation easily satisfy the physical conditions for cluster formation , the conditions of cluster formation do not necessarily provide the physical conditions for massive star formation .",
    "the clusters appear to be continuously forming in the galactic disk and the direct study of their physical conditions and the processes leading to their formation is basically possible .",
    "however , discovering clusters at an early evolutionary stage via optical observations is difficult because such clusters are completely embedded in dense gas and dust .",
    "therefore , observation by infrared instruments is necessary to study cluster formation .",
    "recently , many young embedded clusters within molecular clouds have been discovered by infrared observations ( e.g. , bica et al . 2003 ) . on the basis of these observations , to investigate the physical conditions in the dense gas that forms rich clusters , dense molecular gas surveys were carried out on such young clusters that include massive stars , revealing that clusters are formed in gas systems with a size scale of a cluster ( @xmath1 pc ) in gmcs ( e.g. , lada 1992 ; lada & lada 2003 ; saito et al . 2007 ) and these systems are usually called `` clumps . ''",
    "however , a few very compact gas systems having a size scale of @xmath5 pc similar to typical ( cold ) cores in low - mass star - forming regions ( e.g. , onishi et al .",
    "2002 ; umemoto et al .",
    "2002 ) have been discovered with very high - angular - resolution observations using an interferometer on young clusters that include massive ( proto)stars ( e.g. , churchwell et al .",
    "1992 ; olmi et al .",
    "these systems have high temperatures ( @xmath6 k ) , a high h@xmath4 density ( @xmath7@xmath8 @xmath9 ) , and a high luminosity ( @xmath10 @xmath11 ) .",
    "these results indicate that these systems called `` hot cores , '' would include massive protostar(s ) or massive young star(s ) .",
    "generally , not a large number of stars form in a core even in cluster - forming regions ( e.g. , van der tak et al . 2005 ) . hence",
    ", many cores must form in one clump to create a cluster with a large number of stars .",
    "if this multiple - core system is formed by the fragmentation of the inner structure of the clump , a close relationship should exist between the physical parameters of the clump and the characteristics of the formed cluster .",
    "saito et al . ( 2007 ) carried out molecular line observations using the nobeyama 45-m telescope directed toward the clumps in several cluster - forming regions and suggested that a good relationship indeed exists between the average h@xmath4 density of the clumps and the stellar number density of formed clusters in these clumps .",
    "in addition , they found a good correlation between the line width of the clumps and the maximum mass of formed stars .",
    "saito et al . ( 2006 ) investigated the cores in three cluster - forming regions and found two types of cores in a single clump .",
    "the first type was a core with a large mass and a large turbulent motion , and the second type was a core with a small mass and a small turbulent motion .",
    "they found that massive ( proto)stars are associated with the cores with a large mass and large turbulent motion .",
    "this suggests a theoretical dependence between the mass of the star formed in a core and the turbulent motion in the core ( e.g. , mckee & tan 2003 ) . according to the suggestion by mckee & tan ( 2003 ) , the results of saito et al .",
    "( 2006 ) indicate that massive and low - mass stars can be formed from one clump .",
    "such observations suggest that to understand the mechanism of cluster formation , it is important to elucidate the relationships between the physical properties of cores and physical condition of the clump that includes the cores , and between the mass of the star formed in a core and the physical condition of the core .",
    "if the cores in a clump are formed by gravitational instability as the theory suggests , a strong connection must exist between the spatial distribution of the cores in the clump and the inner structure of the clump .",
    "however , no detailed relationships between the cores and the clumps have been demonstrated .",
    "in addition , although young clusters have a tendency to concentrate massive stars in the center , whether massive cores with large turbulent motion are formed in the center of the clump remains unclear .",
    "therefore , we must observe several clumps to obtain detailed physical parameters of both clumps and cores and reveal the relationships between the cores and the clumps themselves . to detect the cores in the clump",
    ", we must uncover the internal motion and the distribution of the h@xmath4 column density in the clump .",
    "thus , we need to carry out molecular line observations suitable for revealing velocity structures of the dense gas in the clump .",
    "such observations are important to find a protocluster that consists of multiple cores  a `` core cluster . ''",
    "we carried out c@xmath0o observations toward nine iras point sources with young clusters containing massive stars .",
    "the c@xmath0o line is a good candidate for tracing a large dynamic range in mass and column density in the dense gas because this line has a thin optical depth and a low critical density . in general",
    ", the c@xmath0o line can not be used to probe high - density regions ( @xmath12 @xmath9 ) in starless cores because co molecules are depleted onto dust grains in such a cold region with a temperature lower than the co sublimation temperature of @xmath13 k ( e.g. , caselli et al .",
    "1999 ; bacmann et al .",
    "however , previous co observations have revealed that co lines trace high - density regions ( @xmath12 @xmath9 ) well with high temperatures of @xmath14 k ( e.g. , momose et al .",
    "1998 ; schier et al . 2004 ) . therefore ,",
    "if the temperatures of high - density regions ( @xmath12 @xmath9 ) are higher than @xmath13 k , c@xmath0o lines can be used to probe these regions .",
    "typically , the regions where massive stars are formed in gmcs maintain high temperatures of @xmath14 k , and thus c@xmath0o molecules would not be depleted in such regions .",
    "in fact , the structures identified by the interferometric observations toward massive star - forming regions have a high average density of @xmath15 @xmath9 ( e.g. , hunter et al .",
    "2004 ; saito et al .",
    "therefore , c@xmath0o observations can be used to reveal the distribution , mass , and kinetic motion of the dense gas in cluster - forming regions if this line is optically thin enough .",
    "the identification of the star - forming and starless cores requires observation with high - angular resolution of several arc - seconds because massive star - forming regions are generally located at a distance of several kpc .",
    "however , interferometric observation of c@xmath0o cores in massive star - forming regions has rarely been performed . to find dense cores in the clumps with cluster formation",
    ", we carried out c@xmath0o molecular line observations with high - angular resolution toward nine cluster - forming regions using the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) .",
    "the physical conditions of the clumps in these regions were already derived by saito et al .",
    "results of the interferometric observations toward three of these nine regions were already reported in saito et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . here",
    "we present the results of the observations toward the other six regions .",
    "we present our millimeter interferometric observations in @xmath16 2 . in @xmath16 3 ,",
    "the observational results are presented for millimeter continuum and c@xmath0o molecular line .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results for the physical condition of the dense cores in @xmath16 4 . in @xmath16 5 , we summarize the main results of our study .",
    "to compare the physical conditions in the dense gas around young clusters containing young massive stars with the characteristics of the clusters , we need to select targets at similar evolutionary stages and distances and with similar bolometric luminosities , because the observed physical parameters depend on both the characteristics of formed stars ( e.g. , saito et al .",
    "2001 ) and the spatial resolutions .",
    "in addition , the evolution of an embedded stellar cluster is sensitively coupled to the evolution of its surrounding gas ( e.g. , lada & lada 2003 ) .",

    "the uwbc can provide both the upper sideband ( 110 ghz ) and the lower sideband data ( 98 ghz ) .",

    "we defined a compact structure , a core , from the distribution of c@xmath0o intensity to estimate physical properties of the dense condensations .",
    "we used the following procedures , similar to those adopted by saito et al .",
    "( 2007 ) :    \\(1 ) to identify the velocity components in the observed fields , we checked the c@xmath0o molecular spectrum .",
    "if the c@xmath0o spectrum has more than two line features and the separations among their radial velocities are larger than 0.5 km s@xmath2 , each line feature was attributed to different velocity components .",
    "\\(2 ) we made a c@xmath0o integrated intensity map for each velocity component .",
    "\\(3 ) we searched for the i - th intensity peak ( peak - i ) outside previously defined cores ( i.e. , core[1 ] , core[2 ] , ... , core[i-1 ] ) in the c@xmath0o integrated intensity map .",

    "\\(5 ) in cases when sub - peaks exist within the core[i ] , if the intensity at a sub - peak is larger than 6 @xmath30 above the hollow between it and peak - i , we excluded the region around the sub - peak by splitting the core[i ] along the hollow .",
    "\\(6 ) in cases when previously defined cores ( i.e. , core[1 ] , ... , core[i-1 ] ) exist within the boundary of the core[i ] , if the intensity at peak - i is larger than 6 @xmath30 above the hollow between peak - i and the peaks of the previously defined cores , we excluded the region around the peaks of the previously defined cores by splitting the core[i ] along the hollow . otherwise , the core[i ] was canceled .",
    "\\(7 ) we searched for the next ( [ i+1]-th ) intensity peak outside the cores .",
    "\\(8 ) we repeated the procedures after procedure ( 4 ) until the value of the intensity of the local peak went below the 6 @xmath30 noise level .",
    "we identified 171 c@xmath0o molecular cores using these procedures .",
    "the observed properties of the c@xmath0o cores , such as the absolute peak temperature , @xmath31 , the radial velocity , @xmath32 , the fwhm line width , @xmath33 , at the peak position , and the composite line width , @xmath34 , of the core are summarized in table 3 . here , the composite line width is the fwhm line width of the composite spectrum made by averaging all spectra within the core .",
    "the typical uncertainties of the temperature , radial velocity , and line width in the gaussian fits are 0.1 k , 0.1 km s@xmath2 , and 0.1 km s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "we next defined the millimeter continuum sources ( mcss ) from the continuum images to estimate the physical properties of the very dense regions and to identify the positions of the massive ( proto)stars .",
    "therefore , we identified mcss except the known hii regions from the 98 ghz and 110 ghz continuum maps using procedures ( 3)(8 ) adopted by the c@xmath0o core definition .",
    "we also stipulated that the mcss were detected at both the 98 ghz and the 110 ghz continuum bands . as a result",
    ", we identified 13 mcss and detected six known ( u)c hii regions .",
    "the observed parameters of these sources are summarized in table 4 .",
    "the goal of this study was to clarify physical processes of both cluster formation and massive star formation by investigating the indispensable physical characteristics of the dense gas that forms young clusters .    in this paper , we defined a clump as a fundamental structure in which clusters are formed and defined a core as a fundamental structure in which individual stars in the cluster are formed .",
    "previous studies ( e.g. , umemoto et al .",
    "2002 ; saito et al . 2006 , 2007 ) indicated that the clumps have a size scale of @xmath35 0.3 pc and the cores have a size scale of @xmath5 pc .",
    "the physical quantities of the dense gas in the cluster - forming regions , including massive star formations , are derived from the c@xmath0o - line emission .      generally , the c@xmath0o molecule is chemically stable and the optical depth of c@xmath0o ( @xmath24@xmath25 ) is very thin .",
    "thus , this line is very useful for estimating the h@xmath4 column density . here , we calculate the c@xmath0o optical depth and the h@xmath4 column density under the local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) condition with the excitation temperature , @xmath36 , estimated from the @xmath37co peak temperature of @xmath31(@xmath37co ) = 31  56 k at the position of each maser source ( barsony 1989 ; wouterloot & brand 1989 ; zinchenko et al .",

    "we calculated the h@xmath4 column density , @xmath39(h@xmath4 ) , assuming that the c@xmath0o abundance ratio is @xmath42 ( frerking et al .",
    "the c@xmath0o optical depth and h@xmath4 column density at the intensity peak of the cores range from 0.02 to 0.19 and from @xmath43 to @xmath44 @xmath45 , respectively . from these results",
    ", we found that the optical depth of the c@xmath0o line is very thin .",
    "first , we estimated the line width and the radius of the cores .",
    "we regard the line width of the composite line profile as the line width of the core .",
    "the line width of the cores ranges from 0.43 to 3.33 km s@xmath2 with a mean line width of 1.08 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we estimated the radius of the cores assuming that the cores are spherical .",
    "we defined the radius of the core , @xmath46 , as the deconvolved radius and calculated it as @xmath47 where s and beam area are the area inside the core and the area of the synthesized beam , respectively .",
    "the radius ranges from @xmath48 to @xmath49 pc , with a mean radius of @xmath50 pc .",
    "we selected the cores with the ratio of the deconvolved radius to the observed radius of @xmath51 to select the cores resolved by the present observations .",
    "note that we call the radius calculated from ( s/@xmath52)@xmath53 the `` observed radius . ''",
    "hereafter , we use only the cores with high reliability for discussions involving the radius .",
    "next , we estimated the lte mass , @xmath54 , and the average h@xmath4 density , @xmath55(h@xmath4)@xmath56 , of the cores .",
    "the lte mass of the cores was derived by integrating the h@xmath4 column density over the core .",
    "we assumed a mean molecular weight per one h@xmath4 molecule of 2.8 by taking into account a relative helium abundance of 25% by mass .",
    "the average h@xmath4 density of the core is derived by assuming both a spherical shape and a uniform density and estimated by dividing the mass by a core volume , @xmath57 .",
    "the lte mass and the average h@xmath4 density of the cores range from 0.5 to 54.1 @xmath3 and @xmath58 to @xmath59 @xmath9 , respectively .    finally , we estimated the virial mass , @xmath60 , of the cores .",
    "the virial mass is one of the key quantities by which we can evaluate the equilibrium state of the cores .",
    "the virial mass of the core is derived using the following equation , assuming isothermal , spherical , and uniform density distribution with no external pressure or magnetic forces :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the virial mass of the cores ranges from 0.7 to 143.4 @xmath3 .",
    "these physical properties are summarized in table 5 .      here , we distinguish starless cores and star - forming cores to investigate the star - formation activity in c@xmath0o cores in cluster - forming regions .",
    "we compared the cores with near infrared sources ( 2mass sources ) , mcss , and centimeter continuum sources ( ccss ) as indicators of young stellar objects to reveal star formation in the cores .",
    "in particular , we selected the 2mass sources detected at more than or equal to two bands with @xmath63 mag among the sources associated with the clumps ( saito et al .",
    "20007 ) because the sources embedded in the dense gas must have a large extinction such that the typical peak h@xmath4 column density of the c@xmath0o cores is more than @xmath64 @xmath45 .",
    "note that the 2mass sources identified by saito et al .",
    "( 2007 ) include young stellar objects ( ysos ) , which are the class i  iii type sources , and background sources . here , we define an association as when an intensity peak of one object is located inside the boundary of the other object .",
    "note that the cores associated with only mcss are possibly very massive and dense starless cores .",
    "first , we compared 13 mcss with ccss and 2mass sources .",
    "three of these are associated with both 2mass sources and ccss , and four of 13 mcss are associated only with 2mass sources .",
    "only one of 13 mcss , mcs b for iras06056 + 2131 , is associated only with ccss and is seen as a dark lane in the @xmath65-band image in figures 2(b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the flux density of the ccss associated with mcss corresponds to that of the hii region formed by a b23 star or of the ionized stellar wind formed by a b01 star ( e.g. , panagia 1973 ; felli & panagia 1981 ) .",
    "therefore , the ccss associated with mcss would be caused by the activity of massive ysos .",
    "we also derived spectral indices of mcss from 98 ghz and 110 ghz data in table 6 .",
    "the spectral index of 8 mcss with 2mass sources and/or ccss ranges from 2.2 to 4.6 .",
    "this indicates that the millimeter continuum emission from these mcss is subject to thermal dust radiation .",
    "thus , the four mcss with ccss indicate the existence of young massive ( proto)stars .",
    "three other mcss only associated with 2mass sources except for mcs a for iras19442 + 2427 have a strong intensity peak in millimeter continuum emission , and 2mass sources associated with these mcss have the brightness corresponding to an early b type or earlier star",
    ". therefore these three mcss would include early b type or earlier ( proto)stars . indeed , two of these mcss , mcs a for iras05375 + 3540 and mcs a for iras06117 + 1350 , have a high luminosity of @xmath66 @xmath11 ( corresponding to a b34 star ) and @xmath67 @xmath11 ( corresponding to a o9.5 star ) , respectively ( eiroa et al . 1994 ; felli et al .",
    "although the 2mass source associated with mcs a for iras19442 + 2427 has a brightness corresponding to an early b star , this mcs has no strong intensity peak in millimeter continuum emission and the total integrated continuum emission from the mcs is very weak . in addition , although this mcs has a large h@xmath4 column density ( @xmath68 @xmath45 ) , the associated bright 2mass source has no large extinction ( @xmath69 ) thus , this 2mass source would be located in front of the mcs .",
    "however , four of five mcss with neither 2mass sources nor ccss , mcss a , b , and c for iras19446 + 2505 and mcs c for iras19442 + 2427 , have a flux density of 110 ghz similar to or smaller than that of 98 ghz , and the spectral indices of these four mcss are to be in the range between @xmath70 and @xmath71 in table 6 .",
    "in particular , three mcss for iras19446 + 2505 are located at the edge of the optical hii region , s88b .",
    "thus , we regard these four mcss as consisting of only free - free emission .",
    "note that mcs b for iras19446 + 2505 with a large negative index of @xmath70 is more extended diffusely than the other mcs .",
    "generally , it is probable that the missing flux of the 110 ghz observation is larger than that of the 98 ghz observation for a diffuse extended source because the minimum uv length of the 110 ghz observation is longer than that of the 98 ghz observation .",
    "therefore , the mcs b would have such a negative index .",
    "thus , we regard this mcs as a source consisting of only free - free emission .",
    "the other mcs with neither 2mass sources nor ccss , mcs b for iras19442 + 2427 , has a strong intensity peak and a large spectral index of @xmath72 , which is similar to that of the other massive - star - forming mcss .",
    "hence , in this paper , we regard this mcs as a source with massive protostars .    next , we compared 171 c@xmath0o cores with mcss , 2mass sources , and ccss .",
    "eight of the cores are associated with both mcss and 2mass sources and two of 171 cores are associated only with mcss .",
    "in addition , 19 of 171 cores are associated only with 2mass sources . from this result , all mcss except for four mcss classified as f.f .",
    "( see table 6 ) are associated with c@xmath0o cores .",
    "however , cores n and r for iras19442 + 2427 are associated with same 2mass source and same mcs , mcs a. the intensity distribution of the mcs corresponds to the part with the high h@xmath4 column density of these cores in figures 5(b ) and ( d ) .",
    "the mcs would be associated with high - density part of these cores .",
    "therefore , cores n and r for iras19442 + 2427 with mcs a , which consist of cold dust emission , would be starless cores rather than cores with massive ysos . from these results ,",
    "we regard 27 cores associated with 2mass sources and/or mcss except for cores n and r for iras19442 + 2427 as star - forming cores .",
    "in particular , we regard eight star - forming cores associated with mcss that include massive protostars as massive - star - forming cores .",
    "therefore , we identified 27 star - forming cores , including eight massive - star - forming cores .",
    "these results are summarized in table 5 .",
    "note that the nir source associated with these cores is not necessarily a ( proto)star itself , and the possibility exists that this nir emission is a reflection nebula of one or more central heating source(s ) .",
    "in addition , it may be probable that some of the cores cataloged as starless are associated with mid - ir sources .      generally , the 98 and 110 ghz continuum emissions consist of free - free emission and/or thermal dust emission .",
    "first , we derived the flux of thermal dust component in mcss with ccss .",

    "this indicates that the degree of the dissipation of the turbulent motion varies even within a single clump .",
    "as discussed below in @xmath16 4.1.3 , this may be due to the difference in the initial h@xmath4 density or the external pressure of the core .",
    "we postulate that the difference in the dissipation of the turbulent motion depends on the region where the core is formed in the clump , considering that the clump generally has a density structure .",
    "generally , a core has to be gravitationally bound to result in star formation .",
    "thus , a core with a large line width needs to have a large mass or high external pressure for star formation to occur . here",
    ", we check the virial condition of the cores to investigate the stability of the system .",
    "figure 8 shows correlations among the lte mass , @xmath111 , and the virial mass , @xmath60 , for 181 cores .",
    "most of the cores have a larger virial mass than the lte mass , and no clear difference is seen between star - forming cores and starless cores .",
    "the cores have a virial ratio ( the ratio of the virial mass to the lte mass ) of @xmath112 , although several massive - star - forming cores have somewhat larger virial ratios of @xmath113 .",
    "generally , more extended structures with star formation ( such as clumps ) have a similar virial mass to a lte mass ( fontani et al .",
    "2002 ; saito et al .",
    "the main reason for the difference in the virial ratio between the clumps and the cores is the elapsed time after the structures were formed .",
    "the virial mass of the clump just after formation would be also larger than the lte mass and the clump would be gravitationally bound by the external pressure . the virial mass of the clump will later become similar to the gas mass because the density structure and the internal kinetic motion of the clump change and cluster formation is expected to occur in the clump . therefore , almost all of the clump would be virialized as far as we observe the clumps with cluster formation .",
    "however , many cores would also exist just after formation in the clump .",
    "thus , many `` young cores , '' which have a larger virial mass than the gas mass , could be detected by the present observation .",
    "in addition , the virial mass of the cores , except for massive - star - forming cores , is approximately fitted by a single power - law function by @xmath114 where c.c .",
    "is a correlation coefficient .",
    "the coefficient of this relationship is close to unity , indicating that in the virial equation ( see below ) , the difference in the gravitational and kinetic energy terms is almost proportional to the gravitational energy terms . to strike a good balance between this difference and the external pressure and for more massive cores to achieve the equilibrium state ,",
    "the external pressure on the surface of the cores must be larger .",
    "most of the cores require external pressure to maintain the structures . here",
    ", we estimate the external pressure required to bind the present cores gravitationally . the virial equation is expressed by neglecting the magnetic fields as follows : @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the kinetic and gravitational energy of the core , respectively",

    "next , we investigated the external pressure on the core surface .",
    "since the external pressure is difficult to estimate , we used the average pressure in a clump ( average clump pressure ) @xmath125 instead , although these values generally differ from each other .",
    "the average clump pressure was estimated using both the line width , @xmath126 , and the average h@xmath4 density , @xmath127 , of the clump .",
    "we estimated the average clump pressure using the parameters of the clumps identified by saito et al .",
    "( 2007 ) in table 7 and found that the average clump pressure ranges from @xmath128 to @xmath129 k cm@xmath2 .",
    "figure 9 shows the required pressure of cores plotted against the projected distance from the center of the clump to the core ( core distance ) , @xmath130 . here , the required pressure and the core distance are normalized to the average clump pressure and the radius of the clump , @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "we found that the required pressure for most of the cores , except for massive - star - forming cores , is smaller than the average clump pressure .",
    "therefore , our findings suggest that most of the cores are likely to be gravitationally bound by the external pressure .",
    "finally , we investigated how the required pressure of cores changes with the position in a clump . in figure 9 , the cores with a large @xmath132/@xmath133 are concentrated in the center of the clump",
    ". therefore , the nearer the cores are to the center of the clump , the higher the external pressure on the core surface is expected to be .",
    "when the h@xmath4 density structure of the clump follows @xmath55(h@xmath4)@xmath134 , the pressure in the clump ( clump pressure ) , @xmath135 , is estimated as a function of @xmath130 by @xmath135/@xmath133 = ( @xmath136/3)@xmath137/@xmath131)@xmath138 . here , we assumed that the turbulent velocity is constant within the clump .",
    "for comparison , the distributions of the clump pressure for @xmath139 = 1.0 , 1.5 , and 2.0 are indicated in figure 9 by the dotted , solid , and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "these lines are similar to the upper limit of the @xmath132/@xmath133@xmath130/@xmath131 plot , which indicates that almost all cores would be gravitationally bound by the external pressure if the h@xmath4 density structure in the clump has a relation of @xmath55(h@xmath4)@xmath134 .",
    "in addition , these results suggest that the external pressure of the core surface would depend on the h@xmath4 density structure in the clump .",
    "here , we investigated the relationship between the lte mass and the line width of the core .",
    "figure 10 shows that the lte mass of the cores increases in proportion to the square of the line width , although the dispersion of the plot is large .",
    "this tendency agrees with the result of @xmath16 4.1.2 : from equations ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) , we obtain the relationship @xmath140 considering that the radius of the cores is almost constant . from this tendency ,",
    "dense gas with a large kinetic motion in a clump seems to be necessary to form massive cores because the lte mass of the cores increases with the line width .",
    "figure 10 also indicates that no clear difference exists between star - forming and starless cores , although several massive - star - forming cores ( black circles ) have somewhat larger line widths than the other cores with a similar mass .",
    "for example , the average line widths of massive - star - forming cores and the starless cores ( massive starless cores ) with a mass @xmath141 @xmath3 are calculated as 2.8 km s@xmath2 and 2.0 km s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the main cause of the difference in the line width is supposed to be the effect of star formation .",
    "if massive stars in massive - star - forming cores have formed from massive starless cores with a similar mass of @xmath142 @xmath3 , the increase in momentum due to star formation is roughly estimated to be @xmath143 @xmath3 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the estimated increase in momentum is much smaller than the outflow momentum supplied by massive protostar(s ) .",
    "for example , the total outflow momentum supplied by massive protostar(s ) with a luminosity of @xmath144 @xmath11 is estimated to be @xmath145 @xmath3 km s@xmath2 ( zhang et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this indicates that at most only a tenth the total outflow momentum is injected to the present core , and almost all of the outflow momentum is likely to be supplied into the intercore gas or outside the clump . in other words",
    ", massive - star - forming cores should have a large line width even prior to star formation .",
    "therefore , we suggest that although star formation activity tends to enhance the line width of the cores , massive starless cores should form from a dense gas with a large kinetic motion .    finally , considering that the range of the radius of the cores is small , the relationship between the mass and the line width of the cores suggests that the average h@xmath4 density of the cores would increase with the line width of the cores .",
    "according to this result and the discussion on the external pressure in @xmath16 4.1.2 , a small dissipation of the turbulent motion is sufficient for a core formed in the center of the clump with the h@xmath4 density structure to be gravitationally bound because the initial condition of this core necessarily has a high h@xmath4 density and a high external pressure . in this case ,",
    "the index @xmath106 of the line width ",
    "radius relationship from the clump to the core would become very small ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "however , a core formed at the edge of the clump must undergo a large dissipation of turbulent motion to be gravitationally bound , and the index @xmath106 would become large ( @xmath147 ) . in other words , the physical parameters of the core would depend on the place where the core is formed in the clump . this relationship is discussed in detail in @xmath16 4.2.2 .      here",
    ", we discuss the relationships between the mass of the star formed in the core and the physical parameters of the core and between the physical parameters and the positions of the cores in the clump .",
    "generally , the mass of a star is expected to depend on the physical properties of the parental core in a clump .",
    "thus , the characteristics of the stellar member of the cluster would depend on the characteristics of the cores in the clump .",
    "in addition , saito et al . ( 2007 ) found that the maximum mass of the stars associated with the clump increases with the line width of the clump and that a good correlation exists between the stellar number density of the cluster and the average h@xmath4 density of the clump .",
    "these results indicate the importance of revealing the relationships among the clump , the cores , and young ( proto)star(s ) to investigate both cluster formation and massive star formation .",
    "typical massive - star - forming cores have a higher h@xmath4 density , larger line width , and higher temperature than the low - mass star - forming cores ( e.g. , churchwell et al .",
    "1992 ; olmi et al .",
    "although many observations with such tendencies have been reported , the relationship between the mass of the star and the physical properties of the parental core has never been quantitatively investigated .",
    "the main reason is that the discovery of the cores forming stars with various masses in the same region has been very difficult .",
    "however , typical stellar clusters have many stars with various masses , and stars formed in star - forming cores described here are expected to have a wide range of masses .",
    "therefore , we estimated the stellar masses of the stars using the same method as saito et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . for stars",
    "whose luminosities have been estimated or stars with centimeter - continuum sources , we estimated their spectral types using these parameters .",
    "we estimated the spectral types of other stars from the @xmath148/@xmath149 color  magnitude diagrams using the 2mass catalog .",
    "figure 11 shows the relationships between the mass of ( proto)stars associated with cores , @xmath150 , and the physical parameters , lte mass and line width , of the cores .",
    "a tendency exists for the mass of stars to increase with these parameters .",
    "these results indicate that the mass of the star would depend on the mass ( or the h@xmath4 density ) and internal kinetic motion of the parental core .",
    "generally , high average h@xmath4 density and large internal kinetic motion would be expected to lead to a high mass accretion rate ( e.g. , mckee & tan 2003 ) .",
    "although the plot of the relationship between the mass of the stars and the mass of the cores has a large scattering , the plot can roughly be expressed by the relationship of @xmath150 = @xmath54 , which is indicated by the solid line . from this relationship ,",
    "the star - formation efficiency ( sfe ) is roughly constant at @xmath151% using the equation of sfe = @xmath150/(@xmath150 + @xmath54 ) .",
    "note that the mass of the core is expected to decrease with the age of the protostar(s ) .",
    "based on the above relationships and the mass  line width relationship in @xmath16 4.1.3 , the magnitude of internal kinetic energy of the core would determine the mass of the formed stars .",
    "in addition , the core must have existed in the clump at least during the lifetime of the clump for star formation to occur therein .",
    "it is therefore necessary for the core to be gravitationally bound . from these results , we suggest that the necessary and sufficient condition to form a higher mass star is that the core has a larger internal kinetic motion and is gravitationally bound . in this case",
    ", it is not necessary for the core to be self - gravitationally bound if high external pressure is brought to bear on the core surface . because the internal kinetic motion basically decreases with time , a structure such as a molecular cloud much larger than a core or a clump",
    "must previously have had a large internal kinetic motion and must be gravitationally bound for massive star formation to occur .",
    "thus , gmcs and clouds with an external effect , for example , hii regions and supernova remnants , would be good environments for massive star formation because such clouds would have a large external pressure and be supplied with large kinetic energy .      here",
    ", we discuss the spatial distribution of the physical parameters of the cores in the clump . in @xmath16 4.1",
    ", we found that dense gas with a large kinetic motion in a clump seems to be necessary to form massive cores , and the external pressure on the surface of cores must be large for massive cores to achieve an equilibrium state .",
    "in addition , cores with large external pressure are concentrated in the center of the clump .",
    "thus , the physical properties of the core are expected to depend on the physical condition of the region where the core is formed in the clump .",
    "first , we examined the relationship between the physical parameters , line width and lte mass , of the cores and the core distance ( see @xmath16 4.1.2 ) .",
    "figure 12(a ) shows the masses of the cores plotted against the core distance .",
    "although no clear tendency is seen in this plot , the upper limit of the core mass would gradually decrease with the core distance .",
    "if the average h@xmath4 density of the cores is proportional to the h@xmath4 density in the clump having a density structure of @xmath152 , at the region where the core was formed , the core mass can be expressed by the relationship @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the mean molecular weight per one h@xmath4 molecule and the hydrogen mass , respectively , and @xmath156 and c are the h@xmath4 density in the clump at the distance of @xmath131 from the center of the clump and the proportional coefficient , respectively .",

    ", the mass ( or the average h@xmath4 density ) of the core is suggested to depend on the h@xmath4 density of the region where the core is formed in the clump , and the distribution of the core mass is suggested to be controlled by the h@xmath4 density structure in the clump .",
    "figure 12(b ) shows the ratio of the line width for the core and the clump plotted against the core distance .",
    "the starless cores with a high line width ratio ( @xmath159 ) are concentrated in the center of the clump , and the upper limit of this ratio would gradually decrease with the core distance .",
    "the reason for this feature would be the change in both the core mass and the external pressure on the core surface .    here ,",
    "if we assume the cores are gravitationally bound by the clump pressure , we can estimate the maximum line width of the cores using the virial equation ( see @xmath16 4.1.2 ) .",
    "if the clump with the physical parameters adopted in the above discussion is gravitationally bound , a line width of the clump is 2.2 km s@xmath2 . in this case , the ratio of the maximum line width of the cores to the line width of the clump with @xmath139 = 1.0 and 2.0 is indicated by the solid and dashed lines , respectively , in figure 12(b ) . as shown in figure 12(b ) , the distribution of the upper limit of the line width ratio is similar to the relationships expressed by the two lines . as we have seen in @xmath16 4.1.2 and the above - mentioned mass  distance relationship ,",
    "the external pressure on the core surface and the core mass are likely to depend on the core distance due to the h@xmath4 density structure in the clump .",
    "therefore , to bind gravitationally , the internal kinetic motion of the core would also necessarily depend on the core distance .    from the discussions in this subsection , we suggest that the central region of the clump , which has a density structure of @xmath152 , is the environment in which the core with a large internal kinetic motion and a high average h@xmath4 density is easily formed and that the internal kinetic motion and the average h@xmath4 density of the core would depend on the h@xmath4 density structure in the clump . in addition , according to the result in @xmath16 4.2.1 , the mass of a star formed in the core would decrease with the distance from the center of the clump . therefore , the physical characteristics of the cluster would depend on the h@xmath4 density structure , internal kinetic motion , and the mechanism of core formation in the clump .",
    "finally , we discuss the relationship between cluster formation and the dense gas structures , cores and clumps .",
    "as we have seen in @xmath16 4.1 and @xmath16 4.2 , many cores with a size of @xmath5 pc that are formed in a clump with a size of @xmath1 pc have a wide range of the line width and the mass , and the spatial distribution of the physical parameters of the cores would depend on the h@xmath4 density structure in the clump .",
    "in addition , the mass of the star would depend mainly on the internal kinetic motion of the parental core .",
    "the stellar number density of the cluster is mentioned as an important characteristic of a cluster .",
    "the stellar number density of the cluster is generally much higher than that of typical low - mass star - forming regions . in this",
    "regard , saito et al.(2007 ) found a good relationship between the number density of ysos associated with the clump and the average h@xmath4 density of the clump , and they suggested that it is necessary for a clump to have a high average h@xmath4 density for cluster formation to occur therein .",
    "this suggests that a relationship may exist between the number density of the cores in the clump and the average h@xmath4 density of the clump .",
    "first , we estimated the number density of the cores to investigate this relationship .",
    "figure 13(a ) shows the relationship between the number density of the cores in the clump , @xmath160 , and the average h@xmath4 density of the clump , @xmath161 .",
    "a good correlation exists between the number density of the cores and the average h@xmath4 density of the clump .",
    "this relationship is roughly expressed by the equation @xmath162 @xmath161@xmath163 and the index of this relationship is similar to the index ( @xmath103 ) of the relationship between the number density of the ysos and the average h@xmath4 density of the clump obtained by saito et al .",
    "this indicates that star formation in the clump is based on core formation in the clump .",
    "although these relations are not expressed by the mechanism of core formation using simple gravitational instability as proposed by saito et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we suggest that for core formation with a high number density of the cores , it is necessary for the clump to have a high average h@xmath4 density as an initial condition .",
    "next , we examine the relationship between the number of the cores and the ysos to reveal the timescale of the cores .",
    "figure 13(b ) shows the number of ysos , @xmath164 , associated with the clump , which were identified by saito et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , plotted against the number of cores in the clump , @xmath165 .",
    "the numbers of the ysos are one to three times larger than those of the cores .",
    "considering that almost all of the ysos would be low - mass stars , the lifetime of the yso would be @xmath166 yr ( e.g. , lada 1999 ) . in this case , the lifetime of the core is roughly estimated to be @xmath167 yr if only one star is formed per core .",
    "in addition , we find 27 star - forming cores in this study and 10 in saito et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and the number corresponds to @xmath168% of all cores .",
    "this result indicates that the lifetime of the star - forming cores , which can be detected by our interferometric observation , is @xmath169 yr .",
    "this timescale is consistent with the fact that the typical mass of the cores associated with class ii stars , whose lifetime is @xmath170 yr ( e.g. , lada 1999 ) , was roughly estimated to be @xmath171 in low - mass star forming regions ( e.g. , tsukagoshi et al . 2007 ) because the detection limit of the mass of the cores is @xmath172 .",
    "therefore , most of the ysos in the clump are not associated with the cores with a mass of @xmath173 and the ysos associated with these cores are regarded as young protostars .    finally , we look at the core - formation efficiency ( cfe ) of the clump . figure 13(c ) shows cfes ( @xmath174/@xmath175 , where @xmath54 and @xmath175 are the mass of the core in the clump and the mass of the clump , respectively ) plotted against the number density of cores in the clump .",
    "although no strong correlation is seen between the cfes and the number density of cores , the cfe gradually increases with the number density of cores in the clump .",
    "considering the relationship between the number density of cores and the average h@xmath4 density of the clump in figure 13(a ) , this feature indicates that the dense gas in a clump with a high average h@xmath4 density is efficiently converted into many cores . from the results that the cfe is @xmath17660% and",
    "that the lifetime of the core is @xmath167 yr in the above discussion , the conversion rate from the dense gas to cores per @xmath177 yr ( core - formation rate : cfr ) in the clump is estimated to be @xmath178 ",
    "20%/@xmath7 yr . thus , in a clump with a low average h@xmath4 density , core formation with a low cfr ( @xmath35 a few % /@xmath7 yr ) could have occurred over a long time of @xmath179 yr if the cfr is always constant .",
    "however , only a part of the dense gas in the clump would be converted to cores because this timescale is longer than the typical lifetime of the gmc ( @xmath180 yr ; e.g. , blitz et al .",
    "2007 ) . on the contrary , in a clump with a high average h@xmath4 density , core formation with a high cfr ( @xmath181%/@xmath7 yr ) could have occurred over a short time of @xmath182 yr .",
    "this indicates that most of the dense gas in the clump would be converted to cores because this timescale is shorter than the typical lifetime of the gmc .    from the above considerations and the discussions in @xmath16 4.1 and 4.2",
    ", we determined that the mechanism of cluster formation would strongly depend on the mechanism of core formation in a clump and that the mechanism of core formation would be controlled by both the h@xmath4 density structure and the kinetic motion in the clump .",
    "moreover , the characteristics of the cluster would be determined by the distribution of the physical parameters of cores in the clump .",
    "if a clump with a very high average h@xmath4 density ( @xmath183 @xmath9 ) , which has a size scale of @xmath1 pc , is formed in a gmc , this clump would be expected to form a cluster with a very high stellar number density very efficiently in a short time based on the discussion of the cfr .",
    "in addition , considering that the virial mass of the clump is similar to the lte mass ( saito et al .",
    "2007 ) , the line width of the clump is estimated to be @xmath100 km s@xmath2 using the average h@xmath4 density and the radius . according to the line width  radius relationship in @xmath16 4.1.1 and the stellar mass  line width relationship in @xmath16 4.2.1 , the cluster formed in the clump would include very massive ( e.g. , o3 ) stars .",
    "thus , the clumps with a very high average h@xmath4 density ( @xmath183 @xmath9 ) would be expected to form a cluster with both a very stellar number density and very massive stars .",
    "in addition , if many clumps are formed in a gmc , star - forming regions within the gmc will include many dense clusters with very massive stars and will be extended with a size of @xmath145 pc because the typical size of the gmc is @xmath145 pc .",
    "indeed , very active star - forming regions occurring in external galaxies , for example , 30 doradus region in lmc , are extended with a size scale of @xmath184 pc and have many dense clusters , which contain many o3 stars , with a size scale of @xmath1 pc , for example , r136a core in 30 doradus .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the mechanism of cluster formation in such active star - forming regions would be basically similar to that in our galaxy , although the clumps in such active star - forming regions would have much higher h@xmath4 density and much larger kinetic motion than those in our galaxy .",
    "we made high - angular resolution observations with the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) of six cluster - forming regions including massive ( proto)stars , in the @xmath24@xmath25 transition of c@xmath0o molecular emission line and 98 ghz and 110 ghz continuum emission .",
    "we identified 171 c@xmath0o cores in 12 clumps toward six cluster - forming regions including massive ( proto)stars . based on our observations",
    ", we studied the correlation between several physical quantities of the c@xmath0o cores and clumps , and discussed the formation mechanism of star clusters .",
    "the main results of the present study are summarized as follows :      \\2 .",
    "we identified 13 millimeter continuum sources ( mcss ) .",
    "seven are associated with 2mass sources and/or centimeter continuum sources ( ccss ) . together with the one mcs that shows similar characteristics to the above seven mcss",
    ", these eight mcss would include massive protostars .",
    "the range of the mass of mcss is 2.7111 @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , we compared c@xmath0o cores with mcss , 2mass sources , and ccss .",
    "we identified 27 star - forming cores including eight massive - star - forming cores .",
    "some cores have various line widths in a single clump . the range of the index of the relationship between the line width and radius of the core and the parental clump differs from core to core .",
    "this implies that the degree of dissipation of the turbulent motion varies within a single clump .",
    "\\4 . for most cores ,",
    "the virial masses are about twice larger than the lte masses .",
    "this indicates that external pressure is necessary for the cores to be gravitationally bound .",
    "based on the virial analysis , the distribution of the external pressure required to bind the cores is likely to be comparable to that of the pressure in the clump with an h@xmath4 density structure of @xmath185 ( @xmath1862 ) .",
    "the mass of the cores increases with the line width .",
    "this indicates that the average h@xmath4 density of the cores would depend on the kinetic motion of the dense gas in the core because the range of the radius of the core is small .",
    "the mass of the star depends on the line width and the mass of the parental core .",
    "in addition , we found that the star - formation efficiency ( sfe ) is roughly constant at @xmath151% and that no clear dependence exists between the sfe and the mass of the formed stars .",
    "\\7 . the mass , line width , and external pressure of the core decrease with distance from the center of the clump , and a relationship exists between these decreases and the h@xmath4 density structure of the clump .",
    "we suggest that the spatial distribution of physical parameters of the cores strongly depends on the h@xmath4 density structure in the clump .",
    "the number density of the cores and the number density of the young ( proto ) stars in the clump have a similar relationship to the average h@xmath4 density of the clump .",
    "in addition , the core - formation rate ( cfr ) of the clump is estimated to be @xmath17820% per @xmath187 yr and the cfr gradually increases with the average h@xmath4 density of the clump .",

    "<S> we present the results of c@xmath0o observations by the nobeyama millimeter array toward dense clumps with radii of @xmath1 pc in six cluster - forming regions including massive ( proto)stars . </S>",
    "<S> we identified 171 cores , whose radius , line width , and molecular mass range from 0.01 to 0.09 pc , 0.43 to 3.33 km s@xmath2 , and 0.5 to 54.1 @xmath3 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> many cores with various line widths exist in one clump , and the index of the line width  </S>",
    "<S> radius relationship of the cores and the parental clump differs from core to core in the clump . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the degree of dissipation of the turbulent motion varies for each core in one clump . </S>",
    "<S> although the mass of the cores increases with the line width , most cores are gravitationally bound by the external pressure . in addition , the line width and the external pressure of the cores tend to decrease with the distance from the center of the clump , and these dependencies may be caused by the inner h@xmath4 density structure of the clump that affects the physical properties of the cores . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the number density of the cores and the number density of young ( proto)stars have a similar relationship to the average h@xmath4 density of the clumps . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our findings suggest that the cluster is formed in the clump through the formation of such multiple cores , whose physical properties would have been strongly related to the h@xmath4 density structure and the turbulent motion of the clump . </S>"
