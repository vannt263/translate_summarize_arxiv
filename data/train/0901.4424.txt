    "the physics of strongly interacting many - body quantum system is central in many areas of physics .",

    "such representations are characterized by a tensor decomposition of the many - body wave - function which allows one to efficiently compute all the relevant observables of the system ( e.g. energy , local observables , and correlation functions ) , and to reduce the effective number of parameters over which the numerical optimization needs to be performed .",
    "mps fulfill these requirements and can be used to describe faithfully the ground states of not critical , short range one - dimensional many - body hamiltonians .",

    "the mera representation  @xcite assumes a decomposition of @xmath13 in terms of a collection of smaller , finite size tensors , which differently from the linear mps structure  @xcite , are organized in a complex two - dimensional graph .",

    "the interest in such subset is motivated by the fact that homogeneous mera s possess an intrinsic scale invariance symmetry built in which is typical of critical , translationally invariant systems .",
    "in particular by removing the first @xmath25 layers from a @xmath14-site homogenous mera state @xmath26 we obtain smaller versions of such vector constructed with only @xmath27 sites which , however , in the limit of sufficiently large @xmath14 ( thermodynamic limit ) still preserve the same correlations of the original one .",
