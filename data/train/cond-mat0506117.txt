    "it is really very hard to say something new on the ising model . the model , originally proposed by lenz@xcite in 1920 ,",
    "was exactly solved for the case of an infinite chain by ising@xcite in 1925 . since then , thousand and thousand of articles and several books have been published on the subject .",
    "the reason is that the model is very simple , but still can be considered as the prototype for systems subject to second order phase transitions and can be effectively used for studying critical phenomena . moreover",
    ", the model and its generalizations and modifications can also be used for studying a large variety of physical systems .",
    "we do not attempt to summarize the enormous work done in these 80 years ; it would go well beyond the purpose of this article .",
    "an excellent historical presentation of the ising model can be found in ref .  , although it is old and obviously not updated . with no pretension of being exhaustive and complete ,",
    "we here summarize the principal approaches used in these 80 years .",
    "a basic tool is the transfer matrix method@xcite . by means of this approach , onsager@xcite in 1944 succeed to give an exact solution of the model for a cubic two - dimensional lattice in absence of external magnetic field .",
    "the theory of spinors and lie algebra was used to simplify the onsager solution @xcite . among the exact results for the two - dimensional case ,",
    "the calculation of the magnetization@xcite and the writing of the spin correlation function in the form of a toeplitz determinant@xcite have to be mentioned .",
    "other simplifications of the onsager solution have been obtained by means of the jordan - wigner transformation and fermionization methods @xcite .",
    "different approaches are based on combinatorial methods@xcite and pfaffian methods@xcite .",
    "more recent approaches have seen the ising hamiltonian expressed as a gaussian grasmannian action@xcite . along this",
    "line , use of operatorial symmetries that simplify the algebra of the transfer matrix has led to the calculation of the partition function for a large class of lattices@xcite .",
    "many approximation methods have been used with the goal of obtaining an expression for the partition function valid over a large temperature range : mean field theory , bethe approximation@xcite , cluster variational methods@xcite , monte carlo simulations , series expansions .",
    "the spin correlation functions have been studied at the critical temperature@xcite and in the asymptotic region@xcite . to study critical phenomena and critical indices , tools like series expansions @xcite , scaling@xcite , renormalization group",
    "theory@xcite have been used .    in spite of the tremendous work done ,",
    "many problems remain unsolved .",
    "the exact partition function in a finite magnetic field is still unknown for dimensions higher than one .",
    "very few exact results have been obtained for the three - dimensional model .",
    "there is no exact solution for the two - layer ising model either .",
    "most of all , a general approach which works in all dimensions and under general boundary conditions , although in some approximation , is needed .    in a recent work@xcite",
    ", we have shown that there is a large class of models which are exactly solvable in terms of a finite number of parameters that have to be self - consistently calculated .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to apply the method proposed in ref .   to the ising model and to show that an exact solution of the model does exist for any dimension . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the ising model for a @xmath0 -dimensional cubic lattice and show that the model is isomorphic to a system of localized spinless interacting particles , satisfying the fermi statistics . in section 3 ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the latter model is solved , that is , a complete finite set of eigenoperators and the relative eigenvalues are determined . then , as shown in section 4 , the exact form of the retarded green s function ( gf ) and of the correlation function ( cf ) can be obtained . in section 5",
    ", we derive a set of equations for determining the charge / spin correlation functions . as",
    "the composite operators do not satisfy a canonical algebra , the gf , the cf and the charge / spin correlation functions depend on a set of internal parameters not calculable by the dynamics .",
    "for the one - dimensional case , by means of the composite operator method@xcite , we calculate these internal parameters ( section 6 ) and the charge / spin correlation functions ( section 7 ) .",
    "although obvious , it is worth noticing that all the results reproduce the exact solution known in the literature .",
    "what are the advantages of the present method and what is new in the context of the ising model ?",
    "we present a new scheme of calculations for treating the model .",
    "the scheme is general and can be applied to any dimension . in the framework of this scheme",
    "we show that the model is always solvable for all dimensions .",
    "the energy spectra of the system are known . in the one dimensional case",
    "we show that the energy scales determined by the spectra rule the behavior at the critical temperature .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that this is true also for higher dimensions .",
    "general relations among different spin correlation functions have been obtained .",
    "these are exact relations and might be used to check the consistency of some approximate treatments or numerical calculations . in order to get quantitative results for the cases of two and three dimensions we have to determine a finite small number of parameters .",
    "all the properties of the ising model , the magnetization , the thermodynamical quantities , the spin correlation functions , depend on these parameters that have to be self - consistently determined . by using algebra and symmetry considerations we calculate these parameters for the case @xmath1 .",
    "extension of the calculations to higher dimensions is under investigation .",
    "the ising model , in presence of an uniform external magnetic field @xmath2 , is described by the following hamiltonian @xmath3 @xmath4 are spin variables , residing on a @xmath0-dimensional bravais lattice of @xmath5 sites spanned by the vectors @xmath6 .",
    "the variables @xmath4 takes only two values : up or down , or more simply @xmath7 . for a hypercubic lattice of lattice constant @xmath8 with nearest neighbor interactions , the exchange matrix @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 where @xmath0 is the dimensionality of the system and @xmath11 runs over the vectors in the first brillouin zone .",
    "the exchange constant @xmath12 can be positive or negative , and accordingly the coupling will be ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic . according to ( [ 2.2 ] ) , the hamiltonian ( [ 2.1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath13 where @xmath14 it is worth to recall that the ising hamiltonian ( [ 2.1 ] ) is invariant under the transformation @xmath15 let us consider a system of @xmath16 interacting spinless fermions residing on the same lattice and let @xmath17 and @xmath18 be the related annihilation and creation operators .",
    "these operators are heisenberg fields @xmath19 $ ] satisfying canonical anticommutation relations @xmath20 as a consequence of the algebra ( [ 2.6 ] ) , each site can be occupied at most by a single particle .",
    "the occupation number of the site @xmath21 , @xmath22 , takes only the values 0 and 1 . by taking into account two - body interactions ,",
    "the hamiltonian for such a system reads as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the chemical potential and @xmath25 is the potential .",

    "we decide to put attention to the model hamiltonian ( [ 2.7 ] ) , which for a nearest - neighbor potential reads as @xmath34 where @xmath35    the spin - inversion symmetry ( [ 2.5 ] ) of the ising model ( [ 2.3 ] ) corresponds to the particle - hole symmetry exhibited by the hamiltonian ( [ 2.15 ] ) .",
    "in particular , we have that the chemical potential as a function of @xmath36 scales as @xmath37",

    "according to the scheme of calculations proposed by the composite operator method @xcite(com ) , one way of calculating these unknown correlators is by specifying the representation where the gf are realized .",
