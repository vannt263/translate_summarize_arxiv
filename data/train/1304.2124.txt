    "theoretical structure of supersymmetry ( susy ) , which is recently an active area of research and interest at the lhc , allows gauge - invariant and renormalizable interactions that violate the conservation of lepton and baryon numbers . in the framework of minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , these interactions are forbidden by imposing an additional global symmetry that leads to the conservation of a multiplicative quantum number : r - parity @xcite , which is defined as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the baryon number , lepton number and spin , respectively . as a natural consequence of this phenomenology , all the sm particles and higgs boson have even r - parity @xmath11 , while all the sfermions , gauginos and higgsinos have odd r - parity @xmath12 .",
    "one of the highest motivations for r - parity conserved mssm is that it provides sparticles to be produced in pairs since two odd particles always give even number of r - parity .",
    "although no susy signal has been detected yet , pair production of sparticles may be an important clue for final states in susy searches at the lhc .    from the theoretical grounds of susy",
    ", one could expose that r - parity conservation is actually inherited from the conservation of @xmath13 and @xmath14 quantum numbers which is the natural consequences of a renormalizable and a lorentz invariant theory .",
    "for such an extended sm theory , it is not necessary to keep those variables still conserved as long as the algebraic structure is safe .",
    "although non - conservation of both @xmath13 and @xmath14 quantum numbers leads to rapid proton decay , a firm restriction to rpv ( r - parity violating ) couplings guarantees a stable proton .",
    "furthermore , allowing many of the interactions with the sparticles in the rpv susy model provides even richer phenomenology comparing to the other models .",
    "however , many of the interactions in these terms may appear to be strictly supressed in the nature .",
    "thus , practical application of rpv in mssm also reveals several implications : firstly , sparticles can be produced in resonance processes as well as in pairs and secondly stabilization of particles ( e.g. : dark matter ) may not be guaranteed directly .",
    "it has been showed that in the context of bilinear rpv model both gravitino @xcite or axino @xcite as dark matter are consistent with a lifetime exceeding the age of universe .",
    "considering the neutrino issue in the sm , bilinear rpv which is induced by bilinear terms in the superpotential can explain the neutrino masses and mixings in compatible with the current data without invoking any gut - scale physics @xcite .",
    "from the recent experimental data , the highest constraints for gluino mass reached about 1.5 tev with 95% c.l . in gmsb and cmssm searches at @xmath15 according to the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite results . for stop and sbottom masses ,",
    "recent constraints are @xmath16 @xcite for @xmath17 and @xmath18@xmath18@xmath19 @xcite for @xmath20 at the lhc .",
    "ongoing researches that can be interpreted in the context of r - parity violating supersymmetric scenarios at the lhc set the limit @xmath21 @xcite for squark masses in muon + jets final states .",
    "as the continuation of the lhc physics program , lhec @xcite can extend these researches into the unexplored high mass regions with a linac - ring configuration which has been decided in the cdr @xcite to continue technical design work .",
    "it should be emphasized that the parameter space which will be covered at the lhec , also intersects with lhc searches , so that the main motivation of this work will be to compare limits between the lhec as the future collider and lhc as the recent collider and to search for a possibility to improve those limits .",
    "after the lhec starts running in full power , the first task will be to reconsider those limits and improve them to constraint r - parity violating squarks . throughout this work",
    ", we will consider the basic energy option as the main reference for lhec , namely , @xmath22 = 60 gev and @xmath23 = 7 tev with @xmath24 .",
    "quarks[fig:1 ] ]    the r - parity violating extension of the mssm superpotential is given by    @xmath25    where @xmath26 are the family indices ; @xmath27 are the @xmath28 indices and @xmath29 are the @xmath30 indices .",
    "@xmath31 are lepton ( quark ) @xmath32 doublet superfields ; @xmath33 are the charged lepton ( down - type and up - type quark ) @xmath32 singlet superfields .",
    "the couplings @xmath34 and @xmath35 correspond to the lepton number violating and baryon number violating couplings , respectively .",
    "one can easily see that the @xmath36 coupling constants are antisymmetric under the exchange of the first two indices and extract the @xmath36 part of the lagrangian as ; @xmath37+h.c.\\label{eq:2}\\ ] ] here , the fourth term directly corresponds to the vertex factors of the diagrams in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "so one can write the parton - level differential cross section for signal in the rest frame of final muon and quark states as ;    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is sbottom mass and @xmath40 is the total width of sbottom that can be calculated as @xmath41 .    ]",
    "since we take the single dominance hypothesis for granted , lighter sbottom mass eigenstate will be the actual object here whenever we refer to sbottom .",
    "for the signal production , one could immediately calculate that the contributions of other down type scalar superpartners are negligible and parton - level contributions of all other quarks are minor except @xmath42 quarks .",
    "therefore , we have taken into account these contributions to evaluate the total cross sections as in fig.[fig:2 ] using the comphep @xcite event generator and cteq6 m pdf @xcite package . in susy phenomenology ,",
    "the magnitudes of the rpv couplings are arbitrary , and they are restricted only from the phenomenological considerations . therefore two standard bounds are taken as @xcite ;    @xmath43    here , it is worthwhile to emphasize that for electron and positron beam options , calculations explicitly show that the @xmath44 beam options always deliver the highest cross section values , even for 60 gev @xmath44 beam option in the low mass region .",
    "this result seems to be contrary with the stop resonance production at the lhec @xcite where @xmath45 beam option delivers the higher cross section values .",
    "the main reason of that difference is related with the subprocess @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes @xmath42 quarks whereas for stop production main contribution comes from @xmath48 quarks in the initial state .",
    "therefore , equation [ [ eq:3 ] ] yields to stronger signal values than that of the stop resonance production . for the rest of this work ,",
    "we choose 60 gev @xmath44 beam option as the default option for investigating kinematical distributions and exclusion limits .    ]    ]    ]",
    "the process @xmath49 where @xmath47 denotes @xmath42 quarks seems to be the main background resource for both beam options at the lhec .",
    "the reducible sm background comes through the subprocess @xmath50 where w boson rapidly decays via @xmath51 channel .",
    "note that , vetoing @xmath52 quark contributions in the final state reduces these subprocesses for considerable amount . in experimental point of view , the background may even be reduced more if c - tagging option implemented for the final state quarks . in our case",
    ", we did nt take into account any c - tagging options because of the considerably low tagging efficiencies .",
    "we have obtained the comparisons of kinematic distributions for backgrounds and for rpv signals using pythia 6.4 @xcite and comphep @xcite respectively as in fig.[fig:3 ] and fig.[fig:4 ] .",
    "we have built a new model implementing rpv interactions and vertex factors in comphep for signal while we have used sm event generator of pythia 6.4 @xcite for background normalizing over @xmath53 events .",
    "@xmath54 distributions of the jets in the final states will be naturally at the order of half sbottom mass since outgoing particles , muon and jets are back - to - back in the transverse plane neglecting the missing transverse energy . since we have neutrinos that will escape from detection in the final states leaving a significant missing transverse energy",
    ", it is important to have non - zero @xmath55 distribution as in fig.[fig:5 ] .",
    ".required luminosities and cross sections of sbottom at the 60 gev @xmath22 beam option of lhec for 95% c.l . with @xmath56 and @xmath57[tab:1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for event selection part of the analysis , a strict strategy has been introduced before for rpv resonance particles @xcite in order to reduce large sm background . in our case , we have developed the following cuts and optimizations :    * kinematic cuts : for muons @xmath58 gev and @xmath18@xmath59 ; for jets @xmath60 gev and @xmath18@xmath61 . *",
    "missing transverse energy veto : @xmath55 < 25 gev .",
    "* invariant mass cut : @xmath62 gev and mass window cut in accordance with the energy resolution . * vetoing b - jets with 60% efficiency : same assumption for b - jet identification in experiments since we need to identify b - jets before vetoing .    after implementing above selection criteria ,",
    "background cross sections are calculated as 1.7 fb for 60 gev @xmath44 beam option and 1.6 fb for 60 gev @xmath45 beam option . for signal production ,",
    "events always survived not below than 85% for sbottom masses between 100 and 1000 gev . in table.[tab:1 ] , one can see the required luminosities to reach @xmath63 significance value ( 95% c.l . ) for both 60 gev @xmath44 beam and 60 gev @xmath45 beam options . in significance calculations",
    ", we have always used @xmath64 formulation where @xmath10 number of signal and @xmath13 number of background events .",
    "it is obvious that lhec can exclude sbottom mass up to 1000 gev in its first runs with 217.5 @xmath65 integrated luminosity if there is no apparent excess from sm predictions on @xmath66 + jets final states .",
    "likewise , we depicted an extended plot of table [ tab:1 ] in fig.[fig:6 ] .",
    "attainable limits for sbottom mass with respect to rpv couplings @xmath67 and @xmath68 are presented in fig.[fig:7 ] at 60 gev @xmath44 beam option of lhec for @xmath6 integrated luminosity .",
    "one can see here that lhec can exclude sbottom mass up to 1200 gev .",
    "the main reason of @xmath69 line extending to high mass region is a few survived backgrounds events after selection criteria . with respect to the recent limits of sbottom mass ( ~ 700 gev ) , minimum attainable limits to rpv couplings @xmath70 calculated at around @xmath71 for a fixed @xmath69 value",
    "]      in this study , we introduced a phenomenological approach for constraining @xmath1 couplings via rpv @xmath3 process ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "resonance production of sparticles via rpv processes is a great advantage for obtaining a stronger signal although the specific final states can broaden the total background just as in our case for @xmath66 + jets final state .",
    "we implemented a stricter event selection in the limits of experimental capabilities to optimize the sensitivity of signal . considering 60 gev @xmath22 beam options of lhec",
