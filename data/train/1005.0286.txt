    "black holes in general relativity have shown us many fertile aspects of spacetime such as the event horizon , the singularity , hawking radiation , and the connection with thermodynamics . among these phenomena",
    ", hawking radiation is particularly interesting because it gives a strong support to the thermodynamical interpretation of black holes .",
    "moreover , it reveals an aspect of quantum gravity .",
    "usually , hawking radiation is explained by quantizing a free field in a fixed black hole background  @xcite . to be specific ,",
    "we consider a real scalar field @xmath0 in the schwarzschild black hole background @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a constant of integration .",
    "when the radius coordinate @xmath3 becomes @xmath2 , the spacetime seems to be singular .",
    "of course , we know it is just a coordinate singularity and the position @xmath4 is the event horizon of the spacetime .",
    "the action for gravity with a scalar field reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the newton constant , the determinant of the metric @xmath9 and the scalar curvature .",
    "classically , nothing can come out from the inside of the horizon .",
    "quantum mechanically , however , it has been shown that black holes can emit radiation , the so - called hawking radiation  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it turns out that hawking radiation has the planck spectrum .",
    "this notable feature conforms to the black hole thermodynamics .",
    "however , taking look at the above action , we notice that the metric should be also quantized .",
    "then , the event horizon becomes fuzzy , that is , black holes are fluctuating . the purpose of this paper is to study hawking radiation from fluctuating black holes .",
    "technically , we consider the interaction between the scalar field and the metric fluctuations . in particular , it is interesting to see if the planck spectrum is modified by the interaction  @xcite whatever small it is .",
    "apparently , this effect becomes significant if the horizon radius of black holes @xmath10 is close to the planck length @xmath11 .",
    "recently , various planck scale black holes and hawking radiation from them have been considered  @xcite .",
    "these black holes can be created at the lhc or in the early universe .",
    "indeed , black holes would be created at the lhc if the dimension of space - time is more than six and braneworld picture is correct  @xcite .",
    "this is because the higher dimensional planck mass becomes @xmath12tev which can be reached at the lhc . in other words ,",
    "the mass of a black hole created at the lhc is of the order of the higher dimensional planck mass . on the other hand , density fluctuations in the early universe",
    "could produce black holes with any mass .",
    "black holes with @xmath13 g created in the early universe lose their masses by hawking radiation and become planck scale just now .",
    "the spectrum of hawking radiation from these black holes might be distorted due to the nonlinear interaction between quantum fields and the metric .    here",
    ", we stress that , even for black holes much larger than the planck length , the fluctuations of black holes might be relevant to hawking radiation .",
    "the point is that the planck spectrum of hawking radiation stems from the exponential elongation of short wavelength quantum fluctuations which can exceed the planck scale .",
    "hence , the interaction between the scalar field and quantum mechanical fluctuations of the metric would be relevant even for the large black holes .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the effect of nonlinear interaction on hawking radiation of a real scalar field from a 4-dimensional schwarzschild black hole . in order to achieve this aim ,",
    "the canonically normalized quadratic action for metric perturbations and the interaction hamiltonian are needed .",
    "therefore , we first construct these actions by perturbing the einstein - hilbert action with a real scalar field .",
    "after that , we give a formalism to study hawking radiation from fluctuating black holes .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ 3 ] , we construct the quadratic action for metric perturbations by perturbing einstein - hilbert action in 4-dimensional schwarzschild background . in section [ 2 ] , we quantize the field and derive hawking radiation . in section",
    "[ 4 ] , we present a method for treating interaction in spherical symmetric space - time and then calculate the cubic interaction hamiltonian from the action of a real scalar field . using these results , we calculate the effect of nonlinear interaction on hawking radiation of a real scalar field . section [ 5 ] is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "technical details can be found in appendixes .    in this paper",
    ", we use the convention @xmath14 and write the schwarzschild metric as @xmath15 where @xmath16 represents the metric of the sphere @xmath17 and @xmath18 corresponds to the mass of the black hole .",
    "in this section , we derive the quadratic action for metric perturbations @xmath19 in the schwarzschild black hole background @xmath20 .",
    "note that our derivation is slightly different from the original one by moncrief  @xcite .",
    "now , the metric is given by @xmath21 here , we can use the general coordinate invariance to reduce the number of variables . under infinitesimal coordinate transformations",
    "@xmath22 , @xmath19 transforms as @xmath23 which shows that there are 4 gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "hence , we can fix 4 variables .",
    "moreover , we can classify the remaining 6 variables into 4 scalar type and 2 vector type ones .",
    "once the gauge is completely fixed , we can obtain the quadratic action . after eliminating unphysical variables using constraint equations , we finally obtain the reduced action for physical variables .    it is easy to extend the analysis in this section to more general cases . in appendix",
    "[ appendixa ] , we present the analysis for topological schwarzschild black holes with a cosmological constant .      first , we consider the scalar type perturbations @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes a covariant derivative with respect to @xmath16 . under the scalar type gauge transformations",
