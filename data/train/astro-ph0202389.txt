    "angular power spectra ( henceforth , aps ) of the galactic synchrotron polarized radiation are raising up an increasing attention in these years .",
    "the first study , based on the parkes 2.4 ghz survey ( duncan et al . 1997 , hereafter d97 ) , was due to tucci et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and other papers appeared shortly after ( baccigalupi et al .",
    ", 2001a ; giardino et al .",
    "the main motivation for these works was the need for an angular - scale  dependent separation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) signal from the polarized radio foreground ; in fact the first work on the aps of a polarized galactic foreground ( prunet et al .",
    "1998 ) modelled thermal dust emission in view of the scenario to be met by planck hfi at 143 - 217 ghz .",
    "cmb polarization is essential in order to remove degeneracies between important cosmological parameters ( zaldarriaga et al .",
    "1997 ) , but the cosmological window ( the region in the frequency  angular - scale plane where the cosmological signal is stronger than foregrounds ) is narrower for polarization than for anisotropy",
    ". a careful study of galactic contamination versus angular scale is thereby necessary .",
    "the study of synchrotron aps may also be important because of its bearing on the knowledge of galactic structure , and in particular of the transverse magnetic field in emission regions and the longitudinal field in compact foreground screens ( tucci et al .",
    "this point is open to future studies .",
    "the purpose of this work is to check the generality of the aps behaviour found by tucci et al .",
    "( 2000 ) : electric and magnetic parity aps are governed ( with reasonable approximation for @xmath9 ) by power laws @xmath10 with @xmath11 in the portion of the southern galactic plane probed by the d97 parkes survey .",
    "although such slopes are close to the values @xmath12 found for thermal dust emission ( prunet et al .",
    "1998 ) , later work cast serious doubts on the generality of this behaviour , as far as synchrotron is concerned . for the aps of the scalar @xmath13 somewhat steeper spectra , with @xmath14 ranging from @xmath15 to @xmath16 ,",
    "are given for the galactic plane by baccigalupi et al .",
    "( 2001a ) and giardino et al .",
    "the former authors also find a much higher slope , @xmath17 for @xmath18 out of the galactic plane from the 1.4 ghz , low - resolution survey of brouw and spoelstra ( 1976 : bs76 ) .",
    "this discrepancy would be important when evaluating the synchrotron contamination at large scales ; it would thereby be rather unconfortable in view of the role of cmb polarization harmonics with @xmath19 in the separation of effects of the primordial gravitational background from those of the secondary ionization of the cosmic medium .",
    "[ this is one of the objectives of the sport project , see e.g. cortiglioni et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . ]",
    "note that the situation is not quite clear for the total intensity @xmath20 either : large values @xmath21 are supported by bouchet and gispert ( 1999 ) and giardino et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , but @xmath22 follows from analysis of the jodrell bank 5-ghz interferometric survey by giardino et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "here we extend our analysis of aps in the galactic plane considering the 2.7 ghz effelsberg survey ( duncan et al .",
    "1999 : d99 ) ; further , we analyse several patches at intermediate galactic latitudes , @xmath23 , from the 1.4 ghz effelsberg survey ( uyaniker et al .",
    "1999 : u99 ) , and finally three regions from bs76 , at 5 frequencies between 408 and 1411 mhz , covering latitudes up to near the north galactic pole . following tucci et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and thereby extending the analysis of baccigalupi et al .",
    "( 2001a ) , we carefully distinguish between the aps providing a fuller statistical description of the spin-2 polarization field ( i.e. , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , from which @xmath26 is usually computed ) , and the @xmath27 spectrum which takes into account only the magnitude of the polarization pseudovector .",
    "this is necessary because tucci et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find quite significant differences between @xmath28 and @xmath4 both for a gaussian polarization field , as predicted in the standard scenario for cmb , and for synchrotron radiation .",
    "our results confirm that slopes around @xmath29 in the range @xmath9 are preferred on the average , in both the northern and the southern galactic plane for @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath28 , although significant fluctuations around theses values are found in @xmath30 patches .",
    "the fluctuations however become stronger in small patches out of the galactic plane , so that a preferred slope should not regarded as meaningful for the u99 survey . in fact , the partial regularities that we find for polarization aps do not support the usefulness of global ( i.e. , full sky ) @xmath6 for a satisfactory description of the spatial distribution of synchrotron : local @xmath6 based on fourier analysis are much more suitable to this purpose .",
    "a consistent picture , however , emerges at all of the scales we investigated . as a matter of facts , from the low - resolution bs76 survey we find moderate slopes for @xmath31 , at all frequencies and even near the galactic pole . due to the limited range of @xmath32 available for the fits",
    ", we find strong correlations between fitted parameters and , as a consequence , large error bars ; however there is no evidence for steep spectra , since the best values lie in the range @xmath33 almost everywhere and are particularly small at frequencies where faraday rotation is more important . for the @xmath4 spectrum ,",
    "the slope fluctuations are smaller than for @xmath6 .",
    "our best value for @xmath34 is @xmath35 at all resolutions and galactic latitudes , and all frequencies @xmath36 ghz .",
    "the difference between @xmath37 and @xmath4 is significant , although not large in the average .",
    "the latter quantity should thereby be confronted with @xmath38 , not with the @xmath39 spectra which are popular among cosmologists , and this is properly done in the last section of this paper .",
    "all of the results that we provide for polarization aps should not be affected by contamination from point sources ; regions with flat @xmath40 on the other hand , are possibly dominated by point sources in total intensity , and are used in this paper to derive upper limits on their contribution to polarization aps , as discussed in section 3 .",
    "our first high - resolution analysis of galactic - plane synchrotron polarization was performed on the 2.4 ghz parkes survey ( d97 ) ; this study , using twelve @xmath41 square patches ( tucci et al .",
    "2000 ) , is extended here to the 2.7 ghz effelsberg survey ( 1999 : d99 ) covering the additional galactic longitude range @xmath42 ( see table [ surveyspatches ] ) and providing six more @xmath43 patches . a belt extended about 54% of the galactic plane",
    "is thereby covered , although with two slightly different frequencies .",
    "the fwhm resolutions are @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively , sufficient to achieve angular scales up to @xmath46 .",
    "the nominal rms noise in d97 is 8 mk for total power and 5.3 mk for polarization ( 5.3 and 2.9 mk in some more sensitive areas ) , while in d99 the rms noise is 9 mk .",
    ".sky regions used for computation of aps [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results of the fits are given in table [ bsgppole ] .",
    "the declared uncertainties , which are 1-@xmath47 errors on individual parameters computed from @xmath48 fields , are large because of correlations in 3-parameter fits .",
    "in particular , we find strong , positive correlations between @xmath49 and @xmath50 , as illustrated by an example in fig .",
    "[ chicontour1408 ] , which refers to the 408-mhz low - latitude patch .",
    "this figure shows @xmath51 iso - contours that we found in the ( @xmath49 , @xmath52 ) plane after minimization with respect to @xmath53 . in spite of the above uncertainties , we find moderate slopes for @xmath54 and @xmath55 , generally in the range @xmath56 . at low frequencies , @xmath57 mhz where faraday rotation is larger",
    ", we occasionally find some slopes @xmath58 , and in one case ( near the galactic pole in the 610 mhz map ) a best value @xmath59 we should remark that due to the finite resolution of our sampling in ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath53 ) space , and the existence of narrow , elongated valleys with @xmath51 near minimum , the best values reported in table [ bsgppole ] are less significant than the full extension of the confidence regions , described by the error bars in the tables .",
    "however , none of the above considerations would change if the centres of such confidence regions were considered instead of the quoted minimum points .",
    "thus there is sufficient evidence that polarization aps are somewhat flatter at low frequencies .    the angular spectral behaviour does not exhibit any clear dependence on galactic latitude at these moderate resolutions .",
    "it makes sense therefore to average over our three patches from the bs76 survey .",
    "rows 1 to 5 of table [ aveslopes ] gives the average slopes @xmath60 and @xmath34 for each bs76 frequency . at low frequencies , where faraday rotation becomes more and more important",
    ", we observe a gradual flattening of both spectra ; the deficit of steepness is more apparent for @xmath60 , in agreement with the considerations of tucci et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . on the other hand , at 1411 ghz where faraday rotation is less important ( but not negligible at all )",
    ", there is no evidence for any difference between @xmath60 and @xmath34 due to the large error bars . also , the result quoted for @xmath34 at 1411 mhz is quite consistent to those found with higher resolution in the galactic plane at 2.4 and 2.7 ghz ( cfr .",
    "the last two rows in the table ) .",
    "the regularities found for polarization aps in this work are not sufficient to establish the usefulness of global ( i.e. , full sky ) @xmath61 for a satisfactory description of the spatial distribution of synchrotron itself , and _ a fortiori _ for the separation of galactic synchrotron from cmb at higher frequencies . on the contrary ,",
    "the local @xmath61 based on fourier analysis are much more suitable for a fuller description of angular structure .",
    "this makes all - sky surveys of polarized synchrotron quite necessary .",
    "quite significant fluctuations are found for parameters fitted in @xmath41 patches .",
    "when we average over larger regions , the most stable behaviour is found for the polarized intensity spectrum @xmath4 which , for all of the surveys analysed by us at @xmath62 ghz , everywhere exhibits a slope @xmath63 this holds in the full range @xmath64 , although we have large error bars for the range @xmath31 investigated on bs76 maps . in spite of the more intricate situation for the other aps @xmath61 ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) , we can state the following :    * in the galactic plane , the slopes of electric and magnetic parity aps are quite moderate at 2.4 and 2.7 ghz , with averages @xmath68 in the range @xmath69 . * local fluctuations",
    "do not allow us to establish equally significant average slopes out of the galactic plane in the same angular range .",
    "* at lower resolution , @xmath31 , large correlation between fit parameters cause large error bars ; however , the best - fit slopes @xmath54 and @xmath55 stay in the range @xmath70 for almost all frequencies ( in the range @xmath71 ghz ) and galactic latitudes , and are quite inconsistent with values around 3 .",
    "the above behaviours of polarization aps should be attributed to galactic synchrotron , with no appreciable contamination from point sources . on the other hand , the total intensity aps may be locally dominated by sources , when they exhibit small amplitude and slope @xmath72 close to zero .",
    "our results resolve the seeming discrepancy with other authors for the angular range @xmath69 , showing that investigators simply have to carefully consider which polarization aps is actually being computed .",
    "our galactic plane result , @xmath73 is very close to results found for the polarization aps of thermal dust ( prunet et al .",
    "1998 ) ; this number is maybe deeply connected to galactic structure . on the other hand , we do not confirm the high spectral slope found by baccigalupi et al .",
    "( 2001a ) for @xmath27 at smaller @xmath32 on three bs76 patches at 1.4 ghz .",
    "our bs76 patches however are different from theirs , being expressely chosen to have a larger signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "our best value @xmath74 , which arises from averaging over 1.4-ghz bs76 patches , is consistent with our results at all resolutions and frequencies @xmath36 ghz .",
    "the latter also agree with results obtained by tucci et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in the arcminute range .",
    "the slope of starligth aps , @xmath75 ( fosalba et al . 2001 ) , is closer to our @xmath76 .    generally speaking ,",
    "the @xmath77 and @xmath78 &  @xmath66 fields contain different physical information .",
    "since @xmath77 does not carry any information on the polarization angle , its spectrum can not properly describe some related effects like , for example , beam depolarization ; it should be used carefully , keeping in mind that it does not provide a complete description of the polarization field .    in particular , if @xmath4 is extrapolated to the cosmological window , it is important to make a proper comparison with the corresponding aps of cmb .",
    "figure [ cmbsyn ] compares both @xmath24 and @xmath4 spectra of synchrotron and cmb .",
    "the reported cmb e - mode spectrum is the output of cmbfast for a scdm model with a reionization optical depth @xmath79 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath80 spectrum is obtained through simulations in a @xmath81 box , with the mean value being subtracted off .",
    "[ simulations of @xmath82 in the same box reproduced the cmbfast output to a satisfactory extent , see tucci et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for details . ]",
    "the synchrotron aps in the figure are extrapolated to 60 and 90 ghz from the galactic plane average spectra ( 6th row in table [ avegp ] ) for @xmath83 , and from bs76 patch centered at @xmath84 for @xmath85 . in both cases , the computed normalization applies to high - emission regions and is not expected to be representative of the whole sky . for the extrapolations to high frequencies we assume a spectral index @xmath86 ( platania et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the results taken altogether offer a quite consistent picture .",
    "they imply that in high emission regions , whathever polarization aps is chosen , the synchroton polarized foreground should be comparable to cmb at 60 ghz even at large @xmath32 . at 90 ghz",
    "the expected scenario looks more favourable for cmb experiments , both at small and large angular scales .",
    "reionization effects on cmb should be investigated at @xmath87 by means of @xmath82 rather than @xmath80 . from the inspection of fig .",
    "[ cmbsyn ] , and recalling that the height of the low-@xmath32 peak of @xmath82 is approximately proportional @xmath88 , we infer that the 90-ghz cmb signal from reionization should prevail on synchrotron at least for @xmath8 .",
    "we finally remark that in the @xmath77 spectrum the `` dc '' signal @xmath89 might be interesting , but fourier analysis is not appropriate to this purpose .",
