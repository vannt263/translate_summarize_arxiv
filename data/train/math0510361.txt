    "the fundamental structural feature of frames that are not riesz bases is the overcompleteness of its elements . to date , even partial understanding of this overcompleteness has been restricted to limited examples , such as finite - dimensional frames or highly structured ( `` lattice '' ) frames of windowed exponentials or of time - frequency shifts ( gabor systems ) .",
    "together , the ideas and results presented in this paper and in @xcite provide a quantitative framework for describing the overcompleteness of a large class of frames .",
    "the consequences of these ideas are : ( a )  an array of fundamental new results for frames that hold in a general setting , ( b )  significant new results for the case of gabor frames , as well as a new framing of existing results that clarifies their meaning , and ( c )  the presentation of a novel and fruitful point of view for future research .",
    "our approach begins with two frames @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath2 is a discrete abelian group ; we then introduce a notion of the localization of @xmath8 with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "the idea of localization is that it describes the decay of the coefficients of the expansion of elements of  @xmath8 in terms of the elements of @xmath9 . to make this notion of decay meaningful , a map @xmath10 from the index set @xmath11 into the index set @xmath2 is introduced . with this setup",
    ", we establish a remarkable equality between three seemingly unrelated quantities : certain averages of @xmath12 and @xmath13 of frame elements with corresponding canonical dual frame elements , which we refer to as _ relative measures _ , and the density of the set @xmath14 in @xmath2 ( * ? ? ?",
    "this equality between density and relative measure is striking since the relative measure is a function of the frame elements , while the density is solely determined by the index set  @xmath11 and the mapping @xmath5 .    due to the length of this work",
    ", it is natural to present it in two parts .",
    "the first part , containing the theoretical and structural results that have driven the research , appeared in @xcite ( hereafter referred to as `` part  i '' ) . in this paper ( the second part )",
    "we accomplish the following two main goals .",
    "\\(1 ) we apply the theoretical results to the case of gabor systems @xmath15 which yields a collection of new results that can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "_ functions with time - frequency concentration generate localized gabor frames _ ( theorem  [ m1local ] ) .",
    "we show how the degree of localization of a gabor frame is tied to the time - frequency concentration of the generating window function or `` atom ''  @xmath16 .",
    "this alone yields a significant improvement over what was previously known about the approximation properties of irregular gabor frames .",
    "we extend these results to more general systems of _ gabor molecules _",
    "whose elements are not required to be simple time - frequency shifts of each other , but instead need only share a common envelope of concentration about points in the time - frequency plane .",
    "_ characterization of the dual frame of a gabor frame _ ( theorem  [ dualgaborlocalization ] ) .",
    "we prove that if an irregular gabor frame is generated by a function @xmath16 which is sufficiently concentrated in the time - frequency plane ( specifically , @xmath16 lies in the modulation space @xmath17 ) , then the elements of the dual frame also lie in @xmath17 .",
    "we further prove that the dual frame forms a set of gabor molecules , and thus , while it need not form a gabor frame , the elements do share a common envelope of concentration in the time - frequency plane .",
    "moreover , this same result applies if the original frame was only itself a frame of gabor molecules .",
    "this greatly extends a recent result of grchenig and leinert @xcite which covered only the case of lattice gabor frames .",
    "a relationship between density of time - frequency shifts and inner products of frame elements _ ( theorems  [ gabordensity ] , [ gaborbounds ] ) .",
    "we apply the core abstract result of part  i , the density  relative measure theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "this implies a remarkable equality between seemingly unrelated quantities : the density of the time - frequency shifts of a gabor frame and certain averages of inner products between gabor frame elements and the canonical dual frame elements . as a consequence",
    "we obtain new relationships between the density of the index set , the frame bounds , and the norm of the window of the gabor frame .",
    "the excess of gabor frames _ ( theorem  [ gaborremoval ] ) .",
    "we show that in any overcomplete gabor frame or set of gabor molecules , a set of frame elements with _ positive density _ can be removed yet still leave a frame .",
    "\\(2 ) we provide a comprehensive examination of the interrelations among the suite of localization localization and approximation concepts introduced in part  i , and in most cases provided counterexamples showing that these implications are sharp .",
    "we briefly review some results known for irregular gabor frames that are related to the themes of this paper and then discuss our new contributions .",
    "there is an extensive literature available for `` lattice '' gabor systems of the form @xmath18 or @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is an invertible @xmath21 matrix .",
    "however , until only recently , very few results were available for irregular gabor systems @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an arbitrary subset of @xmath24 .",
    "some previous papers on irregular gabor frames are @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we note that many basic questions remain open even for lattice gabor frames . for example , until @xcite , it was not known if every overcomplete lattice gabor frame @xmath18 that was not a riesz basis contained an infinite subset that could be removed yet leave a frame .    in @xcite , ramanathan and steger proved a nyquist density result for certain irregular gabor frames . together with the extensions from @xcite ,",
    "this can be stated as follows ( compare also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) :    1 .   if @xmath22 is a frame for @xmath25 , then @xmath26 ; 2 .   if @xmath22 is a riesz basis for @xmath25 , then @xmath27 .",
    "here @xmath28 are the lower and upper beurling densities of @xmath23 , which are defined precisely in example  [ gabordensityrel ] . in the case",
    "that @xmath23 is a rectangular lattice of the form @xmath29 , several alternative proofs of these facts are known , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . for additional history and references",
    "see the exposition in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "note that a lattice @xmath29 has uniform beurling densities @xmath30 .",
    "ramanathan and steger s results showed that it is not the algebraic structure of the lattice as such that is essential , but rather the fact that gabor frames satisfy a certain homogeneous approximation property ( essentially the weak hap presented in this paper , using as a reference system a gabor frame with a gaussian generating function ) . for a gabor frame ,",
    "the hap essentially states that the rate of approximation of a given function by gabor frame elements is invariant under time - frequency shifts of the function .",
    "this is remarkable in the case of irregular gabor frames , since there is no structure to relate the specific frame elements used in the approximation of one time - frequency shift @xmath31 to those in an approximation of another time - frequency shift of @xmath32 .",
    "the hap is a fundamental property of gabor frames , yet very few papers subsequent to @xcite have made use of it .",
    "we investigate the localization properties of irregular gabor frames in section  [ gaborsec ] . following the introduction of some notation in section  [ gaborprelims ] ,",
    "we show in section  [ boxlocalsec ] that every gabor system has at least a weak amount of localization ( @xmath33-row decay ) with respect to the gabor orthonormal basis generated by the box function , and as a consequence , we recover the fact that every gabor bessel sequence has finite density .    in section  [ m1localsec ] we show that much stronger localization is obtained if the reference gabor system is generated by a function that is well - concentrated in the time - frequency plane .",
    "the degree of concentration is quantified by the modulation spaces , which are the natural function spaces associated with gabor analysis . in particular , we show that if @xmath22 is an arbitrary gabor system such that @xmath16 lies in the modulation space @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , and @xmath36 is a reference gabor system whose generator @xmath37 lies in the modulation space @xmath17 , then @xmath38 is @xmath39-localized . additionally , @xmath40 is @xmath41-self - localized if @xmath42 . in particular , by the implications established in theorem  [ relations ] , @xmath33-localization for a frame implies both the strong hap and the strong dual hap , so these results greatly improve the homogeneous approximation property previously established for gabor frames in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in section  [ newresults ] we use this extended knowledge of the localization properties of gabor systems to derive new implications for irregular gabor frames . in section  [ gabordensitysec ]",
    "we recover the density results for gabor frames given above , and furthermore we extend the meaning of density by showing that the beurling densities of @xmath23 are related to the measures of the gabor frame . we show that the upper and lower measures of a gabor frame satisfy @xmath43 .",
    "this gives a new interpretation of the density of a gabor frame , and as a consequence we obtain new relations among the density of the index set , the frame bounds , and the norm of the generator .",
    "in particular , we show that if @xmath22 is a tight frame then the index set @xmath23 must have uniform beurling density , i.e. , @xmath44 .",
    "thus tight gabor frames require a certain amount of uniformity in the index set .    in section  [ gaborremovalsec ]",
    ", we show that if @xmath22 is a gabor frame whose generator @xmath16 lies in @xmath17 , then whenever @xmath45 , there is not merely an infinite subset but a subset with positive density which may be removed from the frame yet still leave a frame .    in section  [ gabordualsec ]",
    "we address the fundamental question of the structure of the canonical dual frame of an irregular gabor frame .",
    "as is well - known , the canonical dual frame of a lattice gabor frame is again a lattice gabor frame , indexed by the same lattice .",
    "this need not be the case for an irregular gabor frame @xmath46 with an arbitrary index set  @xmath23 . a canonical dual frame @xmath47 will exist , but to date essentially nothing has been known about this dual beyond the fact that each dual frame element @xmath48 is some function in @xmath25 .",
    "we prove that if @xmath16 possesses sufficient time - frequency concentration , namely that @xmath49 , then each @xmath48 possesses the same concentration , i.e. , @xmath50 . for the case of lattice systems ( @xmath29 ) , this result was previously obtained by grchenig and leinert @xcite .",
    "however , in addition to extending to the completely irregular setting , we also prove that the dual frame @xmath51 is gabor - like .",
    "namely , even though @xmath51 need not itself be a gabor frame , we show that it will form a set of _ gabor molecules _ , meaning that each function @xmath48 is concentrated in the time - frequency plane about the point @xmath52 with a common envelope of concentration for each @xmath53 .",
    "in fact , this result holds even if the original frame was only itself a frame of gabor molecules .",
    "we conclude the gabor portion of the paper in section  [ molecules ] where we observe that most of the results obtained for gabor frames carry over with minor changes to the case of gabor molecules .    for simplicity of presentation ,",
    "most of our results will be stated for the case of gabor frames for all of @xmath25 , but many of them can be extended to the case of gabor frame sequences , or to gabor frames with multiple generators , by making use of the machinery developed in part  i and this paper . results analogous to the ones formulated for gabor systems could also be formulated for the case of windowed exponentials .",
    "finally , in section  [ relationsec ] we carefully examine the interrelations between the range of localization properties and approximation concepts that have been used to develop the theory .",
    "a set of approximation properties for abstract frames introduced in part  i is given in definition  [ approxdef ] .",
    "these are defined in terms of how well the elements of the reference system are approximated by finite linear combinations of frame elements , or vice versa , and provide an abstraction for general frames of the essential features of the homogeneous approximation property ( hap ) that is known to hold for gabor frames or windowed exponentials ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "theorem  [ relations ] establishes an extensive list of implications that hold among the localization and approximation properties , and additionally in most cases we provide examples which show that these implications are sharp . in particular , there is an equivalence between @xmath33-column decay and the hap , and between @xmath33-row decay and a dual hap .",
    "we believe that localization is a powerful and useful new concept .",
    "as evidence of this fact , we note that grchenig has independently introduced a concept of localized frames , for a completely different purpose , in @xcite .",
    "we learned of grchenig s results shortly after completion of our own major results .",
    "the definitions of localizations presented here and in @xcite differ , but the fact that this single concept has independently arisen for two very distinct applications shows its utility . in his elegant paper , grchenig has shown that frames which are sufficiently localized in his sense provide frame expansions not only for the hilbert space  @xmath54 but for an entire family of associated banach function spaces .",
    "grchenig further showed that if a frame is sufficiently localized in his sense ( a  polynomial or exponential localization ) then the dual frame is similarly localized .",
    "we use the notation from part  i , which we briefly review here .",
    "@xmath54  will refer to a separable hilbert space .",
    "the frame or system of interest will be indexed by a countable index set @xmath11 . the reference frame or system",
