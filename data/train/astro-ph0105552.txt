    "long period variables ( lpv ) form an important class of red giant stars .",
    "they show more or less regular photometric variability with amplitudes reaching up to 8 magnitudes and periods up to 600 days .",
    "they traditionally comprise miras , semi - regular ( sr ) and irregular ( l ) variables according to the amplitude and the regularity of their visual light curves .",
    "they are known to be either o - rich or c - rich , and comprise thus m , s and c stars .",
    "more recently oh - ir sources have been found from infrared and radio observations showing that they belong to the lpv population with periods up to 2000 days .",
    "those sources emit in the infrared and radio wavelengths , and are not associated with any detectable counterpart in optical wavelengths .",
    "the brightest lpvs are luminous enough to be observed at long distances , providing information on the host galaxy , like the magellanic clouds ( see van loon et al .",
    ", 1999 as an example ) .",
    "while the ranges of masses and ages of lpvs are still the subject of discussion , it is generally accepted that they are large , and are therefore considered as very good tracers of galactic history .",
    "the determination of the characteristics of individual lpvs is usually a delicate task due to the complexity of the dynamic and chemical phenomena to be considered .",
    "a statistical study using all available data of a large sample of lpvs is often needed .",
    "a rough example of such an approach could be the relation between the mean visual light curves and the infrared colors of c and o - rich lpvs already presented in mennessier et al .",
    "( 1997a ) . in this paper , hipparcos astrometric data and the available multi - wavelength ( k , iras 12 and 25 ) infrared photometric measurements allow us to calibrate multi - wavelength luminosities and to discriminate between different galactic populations  and thus different ranges of initial masses ( @xmath1 )  among the lpvs according to their kinematical properties . in a second step , individual k and iras absolute magnitudes are estimated for all the 800 considered lpvs using a powerful statistical estimator . + our sample of lpv stars and the data used are described in sect .",

    "in order to benefit from the accurate astrometric data made available by the hipparcos satellite , we use in our study the sample of all lpv stars observed on this mission , i.e. the lpvs brighter than 12.5 mag in v during more than 80% of their variability cycle . the sample is composed of about 900 stars which are either of type m ( o - rich ) , c ( c - rich ) or s ( o / c@xmath21 ) .",

    "one should note that not all authors use this definition for the infrared magnitudes @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the color index @xmath11 used by van der veen and habing ( 1988 ) , for instance , is higher than the one deduced from eqs .  [ eq:12 ] and [ eq:25 ] by @xmath12mag .    among the @xmath13900 stars of our sample , the number of stars for which v , k and iras infrared magnitudes are available amounts to 882 , 652 and 793 , respectively , with 608 stars having both k and iras magnitudes .    finally , variability and spectral types are taken from the gcvs .",
    "the main selection bias in our sample comes from the hipparcos magnitude limit @xmath14  mag ( see sect .  [",

    "are under - represented in our sample , because the hipparcos selection was done on the basis of the visible magnitude .",

    "all stars from the hic , represented by filled circles in fig .  [ fig_biaisobs ] , are found to have @xmath18 , as expected ( the very few exceptions being most probably due to the fact that the assumed @xmath19 relation does not apply to them ) . fig .",

    "this bias is further discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec_envbias ] .",
    "it must be noted that the gcvs itself is , of course , not exhaustive , and is certainly biased at the expense of the reddest stars .",
    "oh - ir stars , for example , are not well represented in the gcvs sample . for these reasons , a statistical method which can take into account all these biases",
    "is necessary for our analysis .",
    "this method is described in the next section .",
    "in this paper the luri - mennessier ( lm ) statistical method , described in luri et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , is used to analyze the sample of lpv stars .",
    "the method has been specifically designed to exploit the hipparcos data and thus is suitable for our purposes .",
    "this method has already given fruitful results , in particular for barium stars ( mennessier et al .",
    ", 1997c ) , ap - bp stars ( gomez et al . , 1998 ) and the lmc distance modulus ( luri et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the use of appropriate statistical methods for the exploitation of the hipparcos astrometric data is crucial in order to obtain correct results .",
    "otherwise the values obtained can be affected by strong biases and the precision of the data will not be fully used .",
    "a discussion on the correct use of hipparcos data and recommendations on analysis techniques can be found in brown et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the lm method used in this paper is especially appropriate for use with the hipparcos data .",
    "we refer to luri et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for a detailed description , and only briefly summarize here some of its main features .",
    "first of all , the stellar _ population _ from which the sample is extracted is assumed to be composed of several distinct _",
    "groups_. these groups can differ in kinematics , luminosity or spatial distribution and its number is _ a priori _ not known .",
    "therefore , using a sample extracted from this base _ population _ and taking into account the selection criteria used to create it , the lm method :    * determines the number of significant discriminating groups and the percentage of each of them in the _ population _ ; * produces , for each group , unbiased estimates of the parameters of the model used to describe it , i.e. : * * a schwarzschild ellipsoid velocity distribution characterized by ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 point towards the galactic center , the galactic rotation , and the north galactic pole , respectively ; * * an exponential distribution of the number of stars in the direction perpendicular to the galactic plane , with a scale height @xmath23 ; * * a normal distribution of the absolute magnitude in the bandpass of the used observed magnitudes characterized by the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 ;    the results of this first step for our lpvs sample are given in sect .",
    "the minimum input data needed by the lm method are the measured positions , proper motions and apparent magnitudes of the stars , but it can also use the parallaxes and radial velocities if available .",
    "the method takes into account the selection effects of the sample , the observational errors , the galactic rotation and the interstellar absorption .    in a second step , once the groups are identified and parametrized , the method :    * computes for each star of the _ sample _ , the _ a posteriori _ probability that the star belongs to a given group ; * uses a bayesian rule to assign each star to a group ; * uses a statistical estimator to obtain estimations of individual distances and luminosities for each star .",
    "this second step is presented in sect .",
    "[ sect : individual ] where the representativity of our sample with respect to the kinematic and photometric properties of the population is also discussed .",
    "the lm method was applied four times , as described in sect .",
    "[ sect : statistics ] , once for each photometric bandpass : v  results already presented in mennessier et al .",
    "( 1997b )  , k , 12 and 25  in the present paper . in principle , one could assign a joint luminosity distribution to two or more bandpass magnitudes simultaneously , and the lm method would separate the sample into stellar groups consistent with all the photometric measurements together .",
    "this option , however , requires a perfectly well known relationship between the different magnitudes in order to define a joint distribution function as realistic as possible for all the band passes .",
    "the correlation between the near - infrared ( k ) and iras infrared properties presently can not be well modeled and very likely has a non - unique form depending on the stellar and circumstellar evolutive stage along the agb .",
    "thus , we decided not to couple the photometric band passes and to calibrate each luminosity separately .",
    "furthermore , bandpasses are related to different physical processes and can provide separate interesting information : v is greatly affected by absorption molecular lines , k reflects the stellar emission , and iras bandpasses depend on the nature and density of grains in the circumstellar envelope .",
    "the lm method is simultaneously sensitive to kinematics and luminosity and thus the number of significant discriminating groups depends on both these characteristics and is not necessarily the same for the different bandpass analyses .",
    "furthermore , the samples used are not the same , and this can also affect the number of discriminated groups .",
    "six distinct groups are identified in the v magnitudes , three in k and four in each of the two iras magnitudes . those are successively analyzed in terms of the classical galactic populations . although the number of groups is found to be different for each analysis , the groups present similarities in their kinematical composition and with respect to the galactic populations ( see sect .",
    "[ sec_propgrups ] ) .",
    "an analysis of the six groups identified in the v band has been presented in mennessier et al .",
    "( 1997b ) .",
    "in order to compare these results with the ones obtained for infrared calibrations , the main results are summarized here .",
    "table  [ tab_estiv ] reviews the estimated mean parameters for the analysis corresponding to the v luminosity at the phase of maximum light .",
    "the lpvs are found to belong to all galactic populations from disk to very extended disk .",
    "we wish to emphasize three points :    * lpvs belonging to the bright disk population ( bd ) have a mean luminosity of @xmath26=-3.6 and @xmath23=104pc , while the corresponding values for the disk population ( d ) are @xmath26=-1.0 and @xmath23=126pc . among lpvs belonging to bd population",
    "there are probably stars at the upper limit of the agb or even at the first step of the post - agb state . *",
    "the main group ( 44@xmath27 ) has an estimated scale height of @xmath23=249pc .",
    "its kinematics is typical of the old disk population .",
    "* a few lpvs ( less than 2@xmath27 ) belong to the extreme extended disk ( ed ) , with @xmath23 greater than 1200pc and a very large schwarzschild ellipsoid velocity distribution .",
    "this most probably indicates a birth of those stars early in the evolution of our galaxy .",
    "those stars should thus be a metal - deficient disk population ( see [ sec_age ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the bright luminosity found ( @xmath26=-2.8 ) .",
    ".v calibration : estimated parameters of the different groups and percentage of the sample into each of them .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     > from table  [ tab_repul ] we can deduce that :    * the groups corresponding to initially less massive stars are essentially attractive for o - rich lpvs and the ones corresponding to initially massive stars are essentially attractive for c - rich lpvs . *",
    "the strong attraction of c - rich stars by groups corresponding to more massive initial stars is clear .",
    "it agrees with the results already given by v calibration ( mennessier et al . , 1999 ) and with both observations and model predictions according to which dredge - up of carbon from core to the surface of agb stars is more efficient in massive stars ( dopita et al.,1997 ) .",
    "however , we must be very cautions .",
    "indeed , the biases described before ( section [ sec_envbias ] ) show the over - representativity of c - rich stars in the sample and the large number of missing lpvs .",
    "to which galactic population do the not - hipparcos - observed lpvs belong ?",
    "are they o or c - rich ?",
    "the ratio of carbon to oxygen - rich lpvs that goes up to 78% for the d(d ) sample could be due to the sampling . thus deduced implications for the dependence on the mass of the efficiency of the dredge - up are to be taken with caution . *",
    "o - rich sra s are distributed close to o - rich miras . *",
    "o - rich srb s are significantly present in the two disk population groups .",
    "the first one is composed of stars without a shell or with a thin one ( cf sect.[sect : iras groups ] ) .",
    "this probably corresponds to early agb stars with a relatively high initial mass .",
    "the second one contains stars with a shell and corresponds to stars in the same stage as sra and miras .",
    "this agrees with results by kerschbaum and hron ( 1992 ) .",
    "o - rich irregular lpvs are close to the srb s lacking a shell and are probably early agb stars .",
    "* the difference between l irregular variable stars according to their spectral type is evident .",
    "c - rich l stars correspond to massive tp - agb s with a thick envelope . on the contrary ,",
    "o - rich l stars are close to early agb o - rich srb s but their initial mass range seems to be more extended to lower masses . *",
    "one ch star ( v ari ) is assigned to the extended disk population and it is the faintest star in all the luminosities .",
    "this completely agrees with the usual hypothesis considering this type of star as an old giant star .",
    "its amplitude of variability is less than 1 magnitude , a very small value even for a semi - regular .",
    "the c character of this type of star is however difficult to explain .",
    "hipparcos observations suggest that v ari could be a suspected multiple star but this is not conclusive .",
    "in section [ sec_lumbias ] we remarked that the brightest stars in the sample agree with the brightest luminosity for each group population ( see figure [ fig_lumbias ] ) .",
    "thus _ we can consider our sample as representative of the lpvs population as far as the brightest luminosities are concerned_. our calibrations show that the upper limit in k luminosity of the od population ( @xmath28 mag . )",
    "is fainter than that of the d population ( @xmath29 mag . )",
    "as seen in table [ tab_estik ] .",
    "this confirms the dependence of the upper limit of the agb on @xmath1 .",
    "willson ( 1980 ) has described a schematic evolution on the agb related to the mass - loss rate , its acceleration by the pulsations and probably the induced dust formation .",
    "she found a difference in solar luminosities of @xmath30 where stars of solar abundance and @xmath31 equal to 1.5 and 1 @xmath32 leave the agb .",
    "our result is of the same order .",
    "using available hipparcos data we apply the lm algorithm to improve the luminosity calibrations in visible , near - infrared and infrared wavelength ranges and to get information about the star and the circumstellar envelope .",
    "+ according to the galactic population  related to initial mass and metallicity of the stars  and to the circumstellar envelope thickness and expansion , several groups of lpvs are obtained : bright ( bd ) and disk ( disk1 ) galactic population with bright and expanding envelope , not so young and massive disk population ( disk2 ) divided into 2 groups : one with thin envelope ( f ) and the other with a bright and expanding envelope ( b ) .",
    "a similar separation according to envelope properties is found for the old disk ( od ) population .",
    "at least some lpvs are found to belong to extended disk ( ed ) population .",
    "+ our results deduced from kinematic properties confirm that the agb evolution depends on the initial mass of the progenitor in the main sequence .",
    "this agrees with the comparison of color - magnitude diagrams using our estimated individual luminosities with theoretical evolutionary tracks . according to the assigned galactic population we can give ranges of age and of the lower limit main sequence mass for each star of our sample .",
    "the upper limit of the agb also depends on @xmath31 .",
    "the difference of the values found in k luminosity limits are consistent with willson s schematic model related to the mass loss rate and its acceleration by the pulsations : `` stars evolve up the agb with only moderate mass loss ; at @xmath33 mira pulsation commences , driving the mass loss rate up by at least a factor 10 '' .",
    "the induced dust formation is followed by the stabilization of the k luminosity after the carbon enrichment .",
    "+ the ultimate aim of this work is to estimate individual k , 12 and 25 absolute magnitudes given , in the annex ( available as an electronic table at cds and in the astrid database ) .",
    "this allows us to study simultaneously the stellar properties and the behavior of the circumstellar envelope .",
    "the results recalled in the previous paragraph are obtained thanks to the estimated individual luminosities and they mainly concern properties related to the assigned galactic populations .",
    "they will be systematically used in another paper ( mennessier et al . , 2001 ) to study implications regarding the physics of lpvs , specifically the simultaneous stellar and circumstellar evolutions along the asymptotic giant branch .",
