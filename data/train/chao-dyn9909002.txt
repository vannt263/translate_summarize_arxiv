    "transport in phase space is an interesting theoretical aspect of chaotic behaviour in perturbed integrable hamiltonian systems , since it is encountered in many problems of physical interest ( e.g. see kaneko and konishi 1989 , meiss 1992 , shlesinger _",
    "_ 1993 , benkadda _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "recently , in a series of papers by lecar _",
    "( e.g. see murison _",
    "_ 1994 and references therein ) , a correlation was reported between transport in action space of the elliptical restricted three body problem ( ertbp ) and the lyapunov characteristic numbers ( lcn s ) .",
    "in particular the authors , using as a model the ertbp , presented numerical evidence for the existence of a power law , relating the exit times of asteroidal trajectories from action space regions with the corresponding lcn s of the trajectories .",
    "a theoretical interpretation of this correlation , in cases of `` strong '' perturbation , where the motion can be considered as a random walk in action space , has been attempted by varvoglis and anastasiadis ( 1996 ) and morbidelli and froeschl ( 1996 ) .",
    "however , in attempting a statistical description of the process , in order to relate the local rate of trajectory divergence to transport , there are two important problems that have to be solved .",
    "the first refers to the difficulty in calculating reliably lcn s in cases where a trajectory is continuously migrating to new regions of phase space , so that the usual method of calculating lcn s ( as the limit of @xmath2 ) does not show signs of convergence .",
    "the second refers to the fact that , in the case of the main asteroidal belt , the perturbation to the motion of asteroids by jupiter can not be considered as `` strong '' .",
    "both problems originate from the fact that the invariant tori in the regions of interest are far from being completely destroyed , so that the phase space is characterised by a pronounced fractality .",
    "this , in turn , implies that transport ( i ) obeys levy rather than classical brownian kinetics ( e.g. shlesinger et al .",
    "1993 , benkadda et al . 1994 ) and ( ii ) can not be considered as a random walk , since it is not a pure markovian process ( there exist long tails in the autocorrelation function , e.g. see meiss et al .",
    "1983 , meiss 1992 and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , if one wants to recover theoretically a law analogous to that of lecar _",
    "et al . _ in cases where the perturbation is not strong , he has : ( a ) to circumvent the problems in the convergence of the function @xmath3 and ( b ) to take into account the non - brownian and , possibly , non- markovian nature of transport in the statistical description of the process .    in this paper",
    "we discuss both problems .",
    "we use a method for the study of transport in hamiltonian systems proposed by varvoglis _",
    "( 1995 ) in order to calculate the fractality of phase space of the model hamiltonian    @xmath4    for the particular case @xmath5 = 0.9 , @xmath6 = 0.4 , @xmath7 = 0.225 , @xmath8 = .56 , @xmath9 = 0.20 and @xmath10 = 0.00765 which has been studied extensively by contopoulos and barbanis ( 1989 , 1995 ) and barbanis _ et al . _",
    "we conjecture that the fractality may be correlated to the evolution of the function @xmath3 and we discuss the possible usefulness of a `` local lyapunov time '' of a trajectory , in accordance to the ideas of benkadda et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and morbidelli ( 1997 ) .    in order to study transport in the phase space of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) we work as follows .",
    "we construct a six - dimensional grid in phase space and we calculate the phase space volume , @xmath0 , of the elementary cells explored by a trajectory up to time @xmath11 .",
    "all numerically integrated trajectories start on the @xmath12 plane with an initial velocity perpendicular to it ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 calculated from the integral of energy ) .",
    "a typical example of the evolution of @xmath0 for three trajectories , a `` central '' one and two adjacent with @xmath15 differing by @xmath16 , is given in fig .",
    "1 . we see that , in accordance to its definition , @xmath0 is the superposition of `` step functions '' and we note that these `` steps '' seem to have sizes of widely different values .",
    "we interpret the form of @xmath0 as follows .",
    "consecutive small steps indicate that the trajectory is diffusing slowly , according to the `` brownian '' model of random walk , in a phase space region characterised by common properties and , in particular , by a common rate of separation , implying a well defined lcn .",
    "a `` large '' step indicates that the trajectory has moved to an adjacent phase space region with different properties .",
    "we test this interpretation by plotting simultaneously the functions @xmath0 and @xmath3 . a typical example of our results is presented in fig .",
    "2 , where we have plotted the above functions for the `` central '' trajectory of fig .",
    "1 . we see that , up to @xmath17 , the trajectory moves in a phase space region whose volume increases slowly with time . from this segment",
    "one would infer that the lcn is close to zero , since the corresponding function @xmath3 decays almost exponentially .",
    "after @xmath18 , however , the trajectory migrates suddenly to a region `` outside '' the initial one and the function @xmath3 does not show signs of levelling off up to the end of our numerical calculations , at @xmath19 . aside from the fact that this picture corroborates our conjecture , concerning the relation between the transport process and the evolution of @xmath3 , fig .",
    "2 is an example of the practical difficulties arising in the numerical calculation of lcn s : the limiting behaviour of @xmath3 is governed by the properties of the `` outside '' regions of phase space and , therefore , it does not reflect the properties of the initial region where the trajectory started . in the next section",
    "we discuss how these difficulties can be circumvented by the definition of a suitable `` local lyapunov time '' .    0.1 cm    proceeding now to the second problem mentioned",
    ", we note that , if the phase space has a fractal structure , then the function @xmath0 should show some sort of self - similarity .",
    "however the time series describing numerically @xmath0 can not be used in a fractal analysis algorithm , since it is not _",
    "( i.e. it shows long - range changes in the mean level ) .",
    "therefore we decided to use instead its derivative , @xmath1 , which has the above property .",
    "we see that , indeed , @xmath1 consists of `` spikes '' of all orders , each one corresponding to a `` jump '' in @xmath0 ( figs .",
    "3 ) . after a transient of large spikes , corresponding to the `` spreading '' of the trajectory in the initially available phase space region , the value of the function drops until @xmath20 , where from the `` forest '' of high `` spikes '' it is obvious that the trajectory migrates to a nearby phase space region .",
    "a closer examination reveals that the spikes possess a prominent self- similar structure : consecutive magnifications of an interval of @xmath1 show that each individual spike consists of higher order spikes , down to a scale size corresponding to the 6-d volume of an elementary cell ( figs . 3b and 3c ) .",
    "however , apart from this qualitative approach , we can obtain a quantitative measure of the `` fractality '' of the function @xmath1 through the calculation of its generalised dimensions , @xmath21 , q = 0 , 1 , 2 , ...",
    "( e.g. see schuster , 1988 ; mccauley , 1995 ) .",
    "in particular @xmath22 is the _ correlation dimension_. a value of @xmath23 implies total randomness , while a value of @xmath24 complete predictability .. it should be noted that the canonical variables @xmath25 ( or any function of them ) are not useful for the study of phase space fractality , since the corresponding sets are `` fat fractals '' ( benettin _ et al .",
    "_ , 1986 ) .    from the calculation of the @xmath21 spectrum we find that @xmath26 ( fig",
    "5 ) , which corroborates the results of the qualitative analysis , showing that @xmath1 is a _ multifractal _ ( for a definition see the appendix ) .",
    "moreover it shows that the transport process is not completely random . from the simultaneous plotting of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath22 for numerous trajectories and segments of them we found that , as a rule , @xmath22 shows a correlation with @xmath3 .",
    "in particular the segments of @xmath1 , corresponding to time intervals where @xmath3 decays , have values of @xmath22 lower than those of the segments of @xmath1 , corresponding to time intervals where @xmath3 increases . on the other hand ,",
    "if the trajectory is treated as a whole , the resulting value of @xmath22 takes an intermediate value .",
    "this fact is in agreement with our interpretation , since , in places where the divergence of trajectories is almost linear with time , we have weak chaos and , therefore , a low correlation dimension .",
    "in contrast , in regions where the divergence of trajectories in exponential , we have strong chaos and , therefore , a high correlation dimension .",
    "however this is not always the case .",
    "an interesting example is given in figs .",
    "4 and 5 . in fig .",
    "4 we give the function @xmath3 for a trajectory with initial conditions @xmath15 = 0.0095 and @xmath27 = 0.0415 .",
    "we see that three different trajectory segments may be defined : one for the time interval @xmath28 , one for @xmath29 and one for @xmath30 . in the first and third segments",
    "@xmath3 shows an almost exponential decay , a typical behaviour of a weakly chaotic trajectory , while in the second segment it shows a steep increase , characteristic of strong chaos . from what has been said above",
    ", the trajectory has migrated from one region characterised by an almost linear divergence of trajectories to another one with the same property , passing briefly through a region characterised by an exponential divergence . in fig .",
    "5 we give the @xmath21-spectra of the three segments and of the trajectory as a whole .",
    "we see that , considering only the three segments , the `` typical '' relation , discussed above , between @xmath3 and @xmath22 still holds . however in this case",
    "the @xmath22 of the trajectory _ as a whole _ is considerably lower .",
    "this implies that , even while the trajectory has drifted from a phase space region of weak chaos to another , going through one with prominent chaotic behaviour , the third segment of the trajectory `` keeps a memory '' of the first , which shows that the process in the second segment is not markovian !",
    "in a perturbed integrable hamiltonian system we can distinguish three regimes , according to the `` amplitude '' of the perturbation : those of `` small '' , `` medium '' or `` large '' perturbations , where the `` amplitude '' of the perturbation is inferred by the dominant properties of the transport mechanism .",
    "in the regime of small perturbation , transport is expected to be governed by arnold diffusion , as discussed recently by morbidelli and froeschl ( 1996 ) . in the regime of `` strong '' perturbation",
    "the following analytic result may be obtained , according to varvoglis and anastasiadis ( 1996 ) .",
    "assuming that transport in a hamiltonian system can be described as a _ normal _ diffusion process , it can be shown that the exit time , @xmath31 , of a trajectory from a `` compact '' region of action space depends on its lyapunov time , @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 stands for the maximal lyapunov characteristic number , lcn ) , through a power law . since transport in perturbed integrable hamiltonian systems can be modeled as normal diffusion only in regions where most of the kam tori are destroyed , the power law dependence appears when the perturbation is strong .    in this paper",
    "we showed that the function @xmath0 may be used to obtain a quantitative measure of the fractality of phase space of a hamiltonian dynamical system .",
    "we discussed how the fractality of phase space is related to the evolution of the function @xmath3 , in the regime of `` medium '' perturbations , and the ensuing difficulties in the calculation of lcn s . a way to circumvent these difficulties",
    "might be the definition of a `` new '' quantity , related to the local ( rather than the usual average ) properties of the phase space .",
    "following the ideas of benkadda _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) and morbidelli ( 1997 ) , this quantity might be a `` local lyapunov time '' , llt , describing strictly the `` autocorrelation time '' , i.e. the time interval after which a trajectory `` looses memory '' of its initial conditions . this quantity may be estimated by the evolution of @xmath0 of nearby trajectories .",
    "e.g. from fig .",
    "1 we can estimate that llt @xmath34 .",
    "note that its inverse , the `` local lcn '' ( llcn ) , turns out to be of the order @xmath35 , an order of magnitude lower than the value of lcn inferred from fig .",
    "2 .    in order to establish a statistical relation between local properties",
    "( i.e. rate of trajectory divergence ) and global properties ( transport ) in the regime of `` medium '' perturbations , the fractality of phase space has to be taken into account , since it affects not only the calculation of lcn s , but the process of transport as well .",
    "in particular the fact that @xmath1 is a multifractal implies that transport in phase space follows levy rather than normal diffusion kinetics , while the results of the @xmath21 analysis show that in several cases the non - markovian nature of the transport process is pronounced .",
    "therefore it is not possible to describe transport through a classical , fokker - planck type , diffusion equation and any attempt to use the `` regular '' random walk theory in order to infer the statistical behaviour of trajectories in a `` medium '' perturbation regime , as it is the case with the sun - jupiter - asteroid problem in the ertbp approximation , might lead to erroneous results .",
    "it should be emphasized that , while the fokker - planck equation can be appropriately generalised , in order to take into account the levy statistics of the random walk process ( zaslavsky , 1994 ) , the problem of the long - tail correlations has not been addressed in a satisfactory way up to now .",
    "the use of the function @xmath0 , presented here , may constitute a useful tool in the study of transport in hamiltonian systems , in particular when the approximation of random walk ( brownian or levy ) may not be adequate .    here",
    "we give , for completeness , some basic definitions on the concepts of fractal analysis used in the paper .",
    "the main property of a fractal set is _ self - similarity _ , i.e. the fact that the set looks the same if one scales appropriately the @xmath36 axes ( @xmath37 ) of the space where this set is embedded . in generalising the definition of the `` dimension '' of a geometrical object ,",
    "a fractal set has a _ non - integer _",
    "dimension , which can be understood in the following way .",
    "if for a set of points in @xmath38 dimensions the number @xmath39 of @xmath38-spheres of diameter @xmath40 needed to cover the set increases like      then @xmath42 is the _ fractal dimension _ of the set . for a `` regular '' geometrical object",
    "@xmath42 turns out to be an integer , which shows that the above definition agrees with the geometrical dimension of a non - fractal set . in the case where the scaling depends on the region of the set ,",
    "the geometrical object is a multifractal .",
    "`` naturally '' occurring fractals fall in this category .",
    "a multifractal is characterised by more than one `` fractal dimensions '' and , in this way , it contains a lot more information than a pure fractal . these so - called _ generalised dimensions _ or @xmath21 _",
    "spectrum _ can be calculated as follows . if we divide the space in cells of linear dimension @xmath40 and we denote by @xmath43 the probability that a point of the set lies in the @xmath44 box , then the generalised dimensions @xmath21 are given by the formula        it is obvious that comparing two multifractals is much more difficult than comparing two pure fractals , since it involves comparing an infinite sequence of numbers , rather than only two ( the two capacity dimensions ) . in applications",
    "one usually compares only the values of @xmath22 , since in experimental results this is the number that can be more easily calculated .",
    "@xmath22 has the name _ correlation dimension _ , since it is related to the _ correlation integral _ , @xmath48 , of the time - series .",
    "it can be proved that , in general , @xmath49 ."
