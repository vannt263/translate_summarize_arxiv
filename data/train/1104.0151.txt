    "evolutionary game theory @xciteis widely applied to study the maintenance of cooperation among the selfish individuals . the prisoners dilemma game ( pdg ) by pairwise interaction @xcite and public goods game ( pgg ) by group interaction @xcite have been extensively used to investigate the altruistic behavior . in a classical public goods game , @xmath8 players are selected randomly from a large population , and each player has two choices : cooperation and defection . a cooperator will contribute a mount cost to the public pool , while a defector contributes nothing .",
    "the accumulative contribution is multiplied by a factor @xmath0 , then redistributed equally among all the players . in a well - mixed population , it leads to a rock - scissors - paper dynamics when loner strategy is introduced @xcite . considering the limitation of the classical game theory ,",
    "some mechanisms and theoretical supplement are proposed , such as reputation and punishment @xcite , network reciprocity @xcite , voluntary participation @xcite .    diversity or the inhomogeneity has been studied in many works , which mainly focuses on the network topology diversity or individual inhomogeneity @xcite .",
    "santos @xmath9 @xmath10 have introduced social diversity by means of heterogeneous graphs , and concluded that cooperation is promoted by the diversity associated with the number and the size of the public goods game , as well as the individual contribution to each group @xcite . considering the profit diversity of the public goods in reality , group diversity is introduced in the public goods game in which @xmath0 follows a given distribution among the population @xcite . however , in real situations , the value of the public goods is not invariable , but evolves because of the external conditions or the reasons of themselves . in this work ,",
    "we study the evolution of cooperation in the spatial public goods games by considering the depreciated effect of public goods .",
    "it is assumed that each individual enjoys the full advantage of the public goods if all the people are cooperators in a single group , otherwise , the value of the multiplication factor of this group is reduced as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "no qualitative change happens when altering the initial distribution of the cooperators .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , description of the model is proposed in detail . numerical simulations and",
    "the correspondent analysis are presented in section iii .",
    "conclusions are drawn in the section iv .",
    "public goods game is studied on a square lattice with periotic boundary conditions .",
    "each player can either cooperate or defect , and interacts with its nearest four neighbors .",
    "here each individual only participates in a @xmath12 group . considering the depreciated effect of the public goods , the multiplication factor @xmath13 of the group centered on individual @xmath14 is rescaled as    @xmath15    where @xmath0 is the multiplication factor indicating the full profit of the public goods of each group . @xmath16 denotes the number of cooperators in this group , and g ( = 5 ) is the group size .",
    "@xmath2 is a tunable parameter , and when @xmath4 , the system returns to the original version in which @xmath0 is invariable and same in each group .",
    "the payoff of player @xmath14 is given by    @xmath17    where @xmath18 indicates the strategy of @xmath14 , @xmath18=1 for a cooperator , and 0 for a defector .",
    "after each time step , a player @xmath14 will update its strategy by choosing a neighbor @xmath19 randomly from the neighborhood .",
    "we adopt the updating rule depending on their total payoff difference ,    @xmath20},\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 denotes the amplitude of noise level . here",
    "we set @xmath22 .",
    "simulations are carried out for a population of @xmath23 individuals with the synchronous updating rule .",
    "initially , the two strategies of cooperation @xmath24 and defection @xmath25 are randomly distributed with the equal probability of 1/2 .",
    "the key quantity for characterizing the cooperative behavior is the density of cooperators @xmath26 , which is defined as the fraction of cooperators in the whole population . in the all simulations , @xmath26 is obtained by averaging over the last 5000 monte carlo ( mc ) time steps of the total 45000 .",
    "each data point results from an average of 50 realizations .    [ 0.4 ] as a function of multiplication factor @xmath0 for different values of @xmath6.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ 0.4 ] with @xmath6 for different values of @xmath0.,title=\"fig : \" ]    figure 1 shows the variation of @xmath26 with @xmath0 for different values of @xmath6 .",
    "one can see that @xmath26 increases with @xmath0 for each @xmath6 , and emergence of cooperation is remarkably promoted compared with the original version ( @xmath6=0 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath6=1.0 induces the best promotion , which suggests that there exit optimal values of @xmath6 for the evolution of cooperation .",
    "then we study the effect of @xmath6 on evolution of cooperation in fig . 2 for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "it is shown that for each value of @xmath0 , there exit intermediate values of @xmath6 leading to the highest cooperative level , and meanwhile , optimal plat of @xmath6 is formed which broadens as @xmath0 increases . moreover , we can also conclude that the initial distribution of @xmath0 has a critical impact on the evolution of cooperation from fig .",
    "it is shown that @xmath27 ( @xmath4 ) or polarized ( @xmath28 ) distribution has an adverse effect on evolution of cooperation , which is consistent with the results in the previous work .",
    "before we further study , it is necessary to explain the results gained above .",
    "it is known that group diversity can promote cooperation in the public goods games in which the multiplication factor @xmath0 follows a given distribution @xcite . in our model ,",
    "diversity of group forms when @xmath5 according to equation ( 1 ) , and meanwhile , the diversity is not fixed , but evolves with the time step as cooperation evolves .",
    "the spatio - temporal diversity contributes to the spread of cooperation , and thereby better promotes the cooperative level than the fixed spatial diversity .",
    "because in the fixed distribution of diversity , the players in disadvantageous group with very small values of @xmath0 will always give up cooperating ( see reference @xcite ) .",
    "[ 0.42]=4.5 for ( @xmath29 ) @xmath6=0.2 , ( b ) @xmath6=1.0 , ( c ) @xmath6=1.8 .",
    "the initial distribution of cooperators is uniform distribution for each condition.,title=\"fig : \" ]    figure 3 shows the time evolution of cooperation for different values of @xmath6 at @xmath0=4.5 .",
    "it is found that for small @xmath6 ( @xmath6=0.2 ) , cooperative clusters are formed , and sustained as small sizes ; when @xmath6 is moderate , large clusters are formed , and are spreading over all the population as @xmath30 evolves . while for the large values of @xmath6 , cooperative clusters ca nt be sustained , and gradually exploited by the defectors with the time step .    [ 0.42 ] as a function of noise amplitude @xmath21 for different values of @xmath6 at @xmath0=4.0 , 4.5 , 5.0 , 5.5 respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ 0.42 ] at @xmath7 for different values of @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath21=0.1 . , title=\"fig : \" ]    we further investigate the impact of noise on the evolution of cooperation in fig . 4 for different values of @xmath0 . apparently , the variation tendency of cooperator density @xmath26 with @xmath21 not only depends on the value of @xmath0 , but also has the relation with the value of @xmath6 : when @xmath0 is too small or too large , @xmath26 decreases with @xmath21 for each @xmath6 , while for a moderate value of @xmath0 , @xmath26 plays nonmonotonic behavior at some value of @xmath6 ( e.g. , see @xmath0=4.5 at @xmath6=0.2 ) .",
    "it should be also noted that cooperation almost dominates at an intermediate value of @xmath6=1.0 for each @xmath0 .",
    "given that the initial distribution of the group diversity plays an important part on the evolution of cooperation , we study the initial distribution of multiplication factor @xmath3 for different values of @xmath0 at @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "5 ) in order to figure out why @xmath6=1.0 has such an advantageous status in fig .",
    "4 . it is surprisingly found that all the initial distribution can be described as gauss distribution , which implies that gauss distribution has an positive effect on the evolution of cooperation .",
    "in this work , evolution of cooperation was investigated in the spatial public goods games by considering the effect of depreciation of the public goods .",
    "we assumed that each individual enjoys the full profit of the public goods if all the players of this group are cooperators , otherwise , the value of public goods is depreciated , which is realized by rescaling the multiplication factor @xmath0 of this group to @xmath31 . so that spatial diversity of the multiplication factor is formed among the population , and meanwhile , evolves with the time step as the cooperation evolves .",
    "we found that compared with the original version for @xmath4 , cooperative level is largely improved when @xmath5 , and there exist moderate values of @xmath6 leading to a best cooperation .",
    "moreover , optimal flat of @xmath6 are formed , and broadens as @xmath0 increases .",
    "the facilitation of cooperation should be attributed to the spatio - temporal diversity of the multiplication factor caused by the depreciated effect of the public goods : spatial diversity stimulates the emergence of cooperation , whereas temporal diversity of @xmath0 contributes to the spread of cooperation .",
    "furthermore , noise impact on the evolution of cooperation was studied , it was proved that the variation of cooperation density not only depends on the values of @xmath0 , but also has a close relation with the values of @xmath6 .",
    "we also noted that there exits an intermediate value of @xmath7 inducing the best cooperation over most of the range of noise . in order to explain this phenomenon , initial distribution of multiplication factor at @xmath7",
    "is studied .",
    "it was shown that all the distribution can be depicted by the gauss distribution , which suggested that gauss distribution has a positive effect on the evolution of cooperation .",
    "our work reiterates the importance of the diversity on the evolution of cooperation , and meanwhile , that gauss distribution has such an advantageous status may give us some inspiration to study the cooperation in a different way .",
