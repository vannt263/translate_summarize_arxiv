    "quantum chromodynamics , the fundamental theory of strong interactions , represents a basic building stone of the standard model .",
    "the determination of its parameters remains an essential task within modern particle physics .",
    "the strong coupling constant can be obtained from many different sources to rather high accuracy @xcite .",
    "investigations for the quark masses face much more severe problems .",
    "confinement effects must be taken into account for most systems sensitive to the masses .",
    "therefore , apart from the top mass , nonperturbative methods like qcd sum rules @xcite , lattice qcd @xcite or chiral perturbation theory @xcite have to be employed .",
    "the extraction of the heavy quark masses was among the first applications of the method of qcd sum rules @xcite . in this framework",
    "the hadronic parameters can be related to a perturbative qcd calculation including the nonperturbative condensate contributions .",
    "the analyses were later updated and extended @xcite .",
    "recent times have seen a renewed interest in these investigations . with the development of nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite it has been recognised that the coulombic form of the potential plays a major role in determinations of the charm and bottom quark masses .",
    "the contributions from nrqcd have been calculated up to next - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) @xcite . in a region where the system is sensitive to mass effects",
    ", they dominate the theoretical evaluation of the sum rules over a pure perturbative expansion in the strong coupling constant .    the fundamental quantity in this type of sum rule analysis is the vacuum polarisation function @xmath6 : @xmath7 where the relevant vector current is represented either by the charm @xmath8 or the bottom current @xmath9 . via the optical theorem",
    ", the experimental cross section @xmath10 is related to the imaginary part of @xmath11 : @xmath12 usually , moments of the vacuum polarisation are defined by taking derivatives of the correlator at @xmath13 .",
    "however , in this work we will allow for an arbitrary evaluation point @xmath14 to define the dimensionless moments : @xmath15 as we will see in more detail later , the parameter @xmath16 encodes much information about the system . by taking @xmath16 larger",
    "the evaluation point moves further away from the threshold region .",
    "as already discussed in @xcite , this leads to a better convergence for the perturbative expansion .",
    "the price to be paid is a small dependence of the moments on the mass .",
    "this again limits the possible accuracy when extracting the mass from the moments . using a dispersion relation",
    "we can write the moments @xmath17 as an integral over the spectral density @xmath18 : @xmath19 the last equation represents a convenient way to express the moments through the velocity of the heavy quarks @xmath20 .",
    "the moments can either be calculated theoretically , including coulomb resummation , perturbation theory and nonperturbative contributions , or be obtained from experiment . in this way",
    "one can relate the heavy quark masses to the hadronic properties of the quark - antiquark systems .",
    "the theoretical setup is identical for the charmonium and upsilon and in the first chapters we will thus not specify the quark content .",
    "the difference will become crucial for the phenomenological part and the numerical analysis .",
    "first we will perform the analysis for the bottom quark mass where the theoretical expansions converge better and then determine the charm quark mass from the more delicate charmonium system",
    ".    of decisive importance for the determination of the masses is the threshold behaviour . here",
    "the system reacts very sensitive to mass effects .",
    "a small change in the mass leads to a relatively large variation of the moments .",
    "thus the mass can in principle be determined with rather high accuracy .",
    "therefore we try to develop a consistent physical description of the threshold region which includes all theoretical contributions and perform a matching between the low and high energy region .    before turning to a discussion of the individual contributions",
    ", the next section shall highlight the special character of the sum rules when applied to the coulomb system . to this end , we present the sum rules in the framework of quantum mechanics which were developed in @xcite .",
    "then we present here for the first time the application of the moment sum rules to a system governed by the coulomb potential .",
    "all theoretical contributions can be described analytically .",
    "the sum rules show the dependence of the mass on the moments explicitly .",
    "furthermore , the dependence of the pole and continuum parts on @xmath21 and @xmath16 will be studied and we investigate how these parameters determine the relative influence between the different contributions .    the results from nrqcd can be described similar to the quantum mechanical sum rules .",
    "they contain a nonrelativistic green s function which is composed of a continuous spectrum above and poles below threshold . we will isolate these contributions and analyse their influence on the mass and the error separately . namely the poles will give the largest individual contribution to the mass .",
    "therefore we will not use the nonrelativistic expansion to the energy levels itself which suffers from large corrections , but rather evaluate directly the green s function in a region where the expansion is expected to work .    as already done in our previous work for the charmonium system @xcite , in the theoretical description of the correlator we will use information both from coulomb resummation and perturbation theory .",
    "the perturbative expansion contains a part which is not included in nrqcd and will be added to the correlator .",
    "the nonrelativistic spectral density is valid for low velocities whereas the perturbative spectral density is well suited for high velocities .",
    "therefore we will introduce a separation velocity to construct a spectral density for the full energy range .",
    "this will allow us to obtain a stable mass prediction for a wide range of parameters .",
    "the matching will turn out to be very smooth for the upsilon system but leading already to a gap for the charmonium .",
    "the analysis will show , however , that this mismatch has no numerical influence on the mass .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 will be used to shift the analysis towards a more perturbative region . there",
    "the expansions of nrqcd and perturbation theory converge faster and the different theoretical contributions are more equally distributed .",
    "this will reduce the systematic uncertainty of the sum rule approach .",
    "since the sum rules keep the analytic dependence on the input parameters , we will investigate in detail their influence on the mass . to estimate the error",
    "we will vary each of the parameters in suitably large chosen windows .",
    "the dominant uncertainty will come from the nonrelativistic expansion and manifests itself in a large dependence on the corresponding scales .    until now we have not specified the mass definition to be used in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1.c ] ) .",
    "a natural choice for this mass is the pole mass @xmath22 . in the numerical analysis",
    "we will first use the pole mass scheme to extract the pole masses .",
    "however , as the pole masses suffer from renormalon ambiguities @xcite , they can only be determined up to corrections of order @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , in the second part of our analysis we shall use the potential - subtracted ( ps- ) mass @xmath24 @xcite . from this mass definition",
    "we can obtain the @xmath25-masses more accurately than from the pole mass scheme .    in the next section",
    "we will discuss the quantum mechanical sum rules . in section 3 we shall present the contributions from the threshold expansion in the framework of nrqcd . here",
    "we will also define the potential - subtracted mass .",
    "the perturbative expansion will be derived in the following section . in section 5 and 6",
    "we will discuss the nonperturbative contributions and the phenomenological spectral function .",
    "then we shall explain the reconstruction of the spectral density .",
    "in the numerical analysis we will obtain the pole- and @xmath25-masses from analyses in the pole- and ps - mass scheme respectively .",
    "the origin of different contributions to the error will be carefully investigated . after a comparison to other mass determinations we shall conclude with a summary and an outlook .",
    "before studying the full quantum field theory case in detail , it will be instructive to first investigate the corresponding quantum mechanical system . since it is possible to describe the system analytically",
    ", one can obtain a clearer picture of the structure of the method and the behaviour of the different contributions .",
    "let us consider a system of two particles separated by a distance @xmath27 .",
    "the schrdinger equation for stationary states takes the form @xmath28\\psi({\\bf x})= e \\psi({\\bf x})\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 represents the reduced mass of the system .",
    "the green s function is constructed with help of the resolvent operator @xmath30 .    by introducing a full set of intermediate states",
    "we obtain the phenomenological side of the green s function in position space : @xmath31 the sum runs over the discrete part of the spectrum , @xmath32 being the eigenfunction to the eigenvalue @xmath33 .",
    "the integral is taken over the continuum part with the spectral density @xmath34 . by taking the derivative at @xmath35",

    "the second line of ( [ eq:2.d ] ) , constituting the phenomenological part , can be compared to a perturbative expansion of @xmath38 thus representing the fundamental equation for the quantum mechanical sum rules @xcite .",
    "so far the discussion has been general .",
    "now we turn our attention to the coulomb potential : @xmath39 in order to improve the predictive power it is convenient to formulate the sum rules in the framework of borel or moment sum rules . both cases will give valuable information : in the borel sum rules we can relate @xmath38 to the retarded propagator and in this way obtain explicit analytic expressions for the perturbative expansion . in the moment sum rules we can derive an equation for the mass and investigate the behaviour of the pole and continuum contributions for different values of @xmath21 and @xmath16 .      in the borel sum rules",
    "one applies a borel transformation @xmath40 to the correlation function .",
    "it is defined by @xmath41 this enhances the importance of the ground state and improves the perturbative expansion . for the sum rule we will need the application of @xmath42 on functions of the form @xmath43 : @xmath44 now we define the borel - transformed correlator as @xmath45 since the higher states are exponentially suppressed , the dominance of the ground state contribution for large @xmath46 is clearly improved .",
    "let us now recall the definition of the retarded propagator : @xmath47 with @xmath48 and by analytic continuation one concludes immediately : @xmath49 the known solution can be written as a product of the lowest order perturbation theory @xmath50 and a function @xmath51 of the dimensionless variable @xmath52 @xcite : @xmath53 with the function @xmath54 . from this formula one can directly deduce the perturbative expansion as a power series in small @xmath52 : @xmath55 on the other hand",
    ", @xmath56 represents the sum of the poles and the continuum ( [ eq:2.i ] ) . by inserting the energy levels and wave functions from eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.e ] ) we can write the pole contributions as @xmath57 where the second line shows the expansion for small @xmath58 . the continuum contribution can be obtained from the difference of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2.l ] ) and ( [ eq:2.m ] ) .",
    "let us now assume a perturbative calculation order by order in the coupling constant . one would successively obtain the different orders in @xmath59 . up to nnlo",
    "only the continuum contribution shows up .",
    "then , at order @xmath60 , one gets a contribution from the poles @xmath61 which is partly cancelled by the continuum contribution @xmath62 ; likewise for higher orders .",
    "the poles , starting from the order @xmath60 , can thus be expected to be suppressed in the numerical evaluation . however , this conclusion is premature . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.m ] ) , the expression for @xmath63 contains an exponential in @xmath58 .",
    "whereas for very small @xmath58 the poles can be safely neglected , for large @xmath58 these contributions grow exponentially and can far exceed the continuum part .",
    "let us finally note that the perturbative expansion is not only an expansion in @xmath64 , but in @xmath65 and thus depends on the borel parameter @xmath46 . the perturbative expansion and the relative size of the poles and the continuum will therefore depend on the sum rule window for @xmath46 chosen in the analysis .",
    "this behaviour is better discussed in the context of moment sum rules which closely resemble the field theory case at hand .      in the quantum mechanical coulomb problem",
    "we define the moments as @xmath66 again , we allow for an arbitrary evaluation point @xmath16 .",
    "a natural scale is given by the lowest bound state energy @xmath67 .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 has been defined somewhat different as compared to eq .",
    "( [ eq:1.c ] ) .",
    "the derivatives must be taken in an energy region below the poles where the green s function is purely real . here",
    ", we must therefore choose @xmath68 whereas in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1.c ] ) @xmath69 already represents a perturbative region . solving the relevant schrdinger equation , the radial green s function",

    "all powers of @xmath79 are resummed . like the parameter @xmath52 in the borel sum rules , here",
    "the true parameter for the perturbative expansion is @xmath80 .",
    "the higher moments can be derived from a recursion relation : @xmath81 to derive the phenomenological parametrisation of the sum rules we need the spectral density for positive energies which can be obtained from @xmath82 @xmath83 is finite in the limit @xmath74 since it is a physical quantity and gives the sommerfeld factor @xmath84 putting everything together , we obtain the phenomenological parametrisation @xmath85 equating this quantity to the theoretical side ( [ eq:2.q],[eq:2.r ] ) establishes the sum rules . using the exact formulas , this of course represents nothing but an identity .",
    "the method comes into play when only limited information on either part is available .",

    "here we shall not discuss the applications of this sum rule , but finally turn our attention to the behaviour of the pole and continuum contributions .    to this end , we again take a closer look to eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.u ] ) .",
    "both contributions depend in a similar way on @xmath21 and @xmath16 .",

    "for low values of @xmath21 the higher poles and high energy part of the continuum integration can have a significant influence .",
    "when we proceed to larger @xmath21 we enhance the threshold region in the continuum integration and the lowest pole in the sum .",
    "taking now @xmath21 fixed we see that the variation of @xmath16 can drastically change the relative size of both parts : since the moments have a singularity at @xmath92 from @xmath86 , values of @xmath16 only slightly larger than one will lead to a complete dominance of the first bound state on the sum rules .",

    "finally we obtain the masses : @xmath94 this value is 59 mev lower than the central value from the pole scheme .",
    "this is no surprise since in the pole scheme the theoretical contributions have large perturbative corrections and the relation between the masses contains large uncertainties as well .    in our previous work on the charm",

    "the author has also performed an analysis using resummation in lo with a value of @xmath103 gev . in our analysis",

    "they conclude a @xmath25-mass of @xmath104 gev where the error is from the variation of @xmath105 only . in @xcite",
    "a similar analysis was performed for the pole mass with the result @xmath106 gev . in @xcite nrqcd",
    "was applied to the mass difference between the @xmath107 and @xmath108 mesons with @xmath109 gev .",
    "further improvement of these determinations may be possible in the near future",
    ". however , these determinations face the problem that the contributions from nrqcd must be directly evaluated at low energies close to threshold whereas in the sum rules the theoretical expansions can be evaluated in a perturbative region .",
    "furthermore , nonperturbative effects may have a significant impact on the charmonium energy levels .    during the last years",

    "the charm quark mass has been determined from charmonium sum rules on perturbative grounds without coulomb resummation .",
    "the authors of @xcite have used moment sum rules for the charmonium .",
    "they use moments of @xmath116 and argue that resummation is not necessary for such low values of @xmath21 . on the theoretical side @xmath11 is calculated up to @xmath117 at a scale of @xmath118 .",
    "this is compared to the phenomenological part which includes the @xmath119 and @xmath120 resonances and the data from bes @xcite above the @xmath108 threshold .",
    "they obtain @xmath121 gev . a similar analysis for the bottom yields @xmath122 gev . in @xcite",
    "a contour integration was performed to apply the cauchy sum rules .",
    "the integral was closed at an energy of 5 gev . at this scale",
    "the high energy approximation was used to calculate @xmath11 up to @xmath117 . as in @xcite ,",

    "@xcite has presented an update of the svz sum rules @xcite with perturbation theory at nnlo .",
    "they extract the gluon condensate and a charm quark mass of @xmath126 gev .    however , in light of the present work it seems doubtful that a reliable determination of the charm quark mass from the charmonium system can be achieved by a pure perturbative evaluation without resummation as in @xcite . to clarify this point ,",
    "let us return to the numerical analysis .",
    "choosing @xmath16 sufficiently large and @xmath21 small enough , one can easily approach a region where the perturbative contribution represents the dominant part .",
    "one could then expect that the use of perturbation theory and its relative small scale dependence will give a reasonable approximation .",
    "nevertheless , this conclusion is misleading .",
    "for values of @xmath127 and @xmath128 the moment from the perturbative contribution exceeds the poles by 30% ( for @xmath129 the phenomenological continuum is very dominant and the analysis becomes unstable ) .",
    "nevertheless , a variation of the soft scale gives an error of @xmath130 whereas the error from the hard scale is @xmath131 and this error could even be improved by using a high energy approximation . for even higher",
    "@xmath16 the result is similar : for @xmath132 and @xmath128 the perturbative contribution is twice as large as the pole contributions , but the error from @xmath133 gives @xmath134 and from the error from @xmath135 amounts to @xmath136 . though the pole contributions are relatively suppressed , the mass reacts much stronger on the remaining uncertainties .",
    "this behaviour can already be seen in table [ tab:9.i ] .",
    "ever higher @xmath16 do not improve the accuracy any more but in same way as the theoretical expansion improves the sensitivity on the mass is lost . indeed ,",
    "if we set the pole contribution to zero in our analysis , @xmath97 would drop by approximately 300 mev even for very high @xmath16 and the analysis could not be trusted any more .    that a description without inclusion of the theoretical poles is insufficient can already be seen from the quantum mechanical sum rules for the mass ( [ eq:2.v ] ) . on the phenomenological side , the main dependence on the mass originates already from the first bound states , even if the continuum part dominates the moments .",
    "the contributions from the poles , starting from @xmath137 , must be included in the theoretical description as well to obtain a reliable mass determination . as was discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the charmonium system is not well described as a coulomb system . in particular ,",
    "the expansion for the higher states can not be trusted and the effective potential may differ from the coulombic one . however , it is indispensable to use the terms from resummation for a determination of the mass .",
    "the most important contribution to the sum rules originates already from the ground state ( [ eq:2.u],[eq:2.v ] ) .",
    "the quantum mechanical sum rules show clearly that fixed - order perturbation theory in a system whose ground state is governed by a coulomb - similar potential leads to an instable and unreliable sum rule for the mass .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that a coulomb - dominated description of the charmonium system stands on less firm grounds than for the upsilon system whose energy is sufficiently large to allow for a reliable resummation .",
    "this is also reflected in the fact that the relative error of @xmath97 is almost a factor 4 larger than the relative error of @xmath138 .    during the last years much effort has been dedicated to the determination of the bottom quark mass .",

    "furthermore , even if the calculation was including the full @xmath137 contributions , these terms must not be taken into account .",
    "the terms from the three gluon cut mainly correspond to light quark production and the divergent parts at @xmath13 are entirely due to light quark production as the heavy quark pair only gives a contribution above @xmath174 .",
    "since they are not included in the phenomenological part they also should not appear in the theoretical part and must be explicitly subtracted from the perturbative contributions . the remaining ambiguity which results from the difficulty to separate the light and heavy quark production in the dispersion integral above @xmath174 is a finite effect of @xmath137 and",
    "can be completely neglected within the uncertainty of this work .    as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the problem is of more general nature .",
    "already starting at @xmath117 , it is no longer true that a specific flavour current @xmath175 contains only heavy quark production neither that all heavy quark production originates from this current . as was shown in chapter 4 for the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig:4.b ] , also light - light and heavy - light correlators contain heavy quark production .",
    "since only the total electromagnetic current , including a sum over all flavours , is a physical observable , the single flavour production is not uniquely defined .",
    "the crucial point is to set up two identical quantities : the phenomenological and the theoretical side should be defined is such a way that they contain the same contributions .",
    "the higher the order this may be a more and more complicated task .",
    "in this work we have obtained the following values for the charm and bottom quark masses : @xmath176 as in the last section we evaluate the @xmath25-masses at their own scale , @xmath177 .",
    "now we summarise the key features of this analysis .    in section 2",
    "we have presented a rather complete setup for the quantum mechanical sum rules in the coulomb potential .",
    "the correlator contains poles below and a continuum above threshold .",
    "the poles only start with a power of @xmath178 , but exhibit an exponential behaviour ( [ eq:2.m ] ) in the borel sum rules or a sensitive power behaviour in the moment sum rules ( [ eq:2.u ] ) .",
    "therefore the relative size of the poles depends strongly on either the borel parameter in the borel sum rules or on @xmath21 and @xmath16 in the moment sum rules .",
    "the analysis must be performed in a certain sum rule window for @xmath46 or for @xmath21 and @xmath16 respectively to guarantee a reliable theoretical calculation and sensitivity to the phenomenological parameters .    in the field theory case",
    "the expansion of the green s function is known up to nnlo in the framework of nrqcd .",
    "the green s function is directly evaluated at @xmath179 and in this way we avoid to sum up the energy levels individually where the expansion is badly convergent .",
    "the spectral density can be obtained from the imaginary part of the green s function and the pole contributions from the difference between the full and the continuum result .",
    "the resulting moments depend on three scales : @xmath133 , @xmath180 and @xmath135 .",
    "in particular the dependence on @xmath133 is relatively strong and presents the dominant contribution to the error . since the pole mass contains renormalon ambiguities we have also performed the analysis for the ps - mass which can be perturbatively related to the @xmath25-mass .",
    "whereas the ps - mass by definition depends on the separation scale which was used to subtract the long - distance potential , this dependence cancels in the transition to the @xmath25-mass to a large extend .",
    "we have then included the perturbative contributions up to @xmath117 .",
    "they are necessary to construct the spectral density above threshold for the full energy range and to guarantee the stability of the mass in a region of small @xmath21 .",
    "one of the great virtues of the method of qcd sum rules is the analytic dependence on the theoretical and phenomenological parameters .",
    "thus we have investigated their importance and influence on the analysis . for the determination of the masses",
    "we have used central values for all parameters .",
    "these values were not motivated by any optimisation or stability requirement , but only grounded on general considerations .",
    "each was varied in a suitably large chosen window for the error estimate .",
    "only the lower value of @xmath133 was also limited by the convergence of the nonrelativistic expansion .",
    "finally , all errors have been added quadratically .",
    "we have set up the sum rules for an arbitrary evaluation point @xmath16 . with this parameter",
    "it is possible to shift the moments into a more perturbative region for higher @xmath16 or into a region more sensitive to the bound state energies and the mass for lower @xmath16 .",
    "we have used @xmath96 both for the charmonium and bottomium .",
    "in fact , moving away from the threshold region and loosing sensitivity on the mass , the scale dependence is even a bit larger than at @xmath69 .",
    "but the convergence of the theoretical expansions is improved and the theoretical contributions more equally distributed among the different terms , in particular , the pole contributions do not play such a dominant role .",
    "thus we believe that we have reduced the systematic uncertainties in this sum rules which can not be accounted for by a variations of the scales .",
    "we would like to emphasise a remarkable property of this analysis : once a particular set of ( central ) values for @xmath133 , @xmath180 and @xmath135 is chosen , the @xmath25-masses remain very stable over a large range of values for @xmath21 , @xmath16 or @xmath181 . in general , the @xmath25-bottom quark mass changes only by @xmath182 from its central value for @xmath183 and the charm quark mass by @xmath184 for @xmath185 . varying @xmath16 between @xmath186 the bottom quark mass changes by @xmath187 and the charm quark mass by @xmath188 for @xmath189 .",
    "the variation of @xmath181 changes the ps - mass significantly since its definition depends on @xmath181 .",
    "but in the relation to the @xmath25-mass this change is almost completely cancelled and the bottom quark mass changes by @xmath190 for @xmath191 and the charm quark mass by @xmath192 for @xmath193 .",
    "these results are astonishing since the variation of these parameters corresponds to largely different relative influence among the theoretical contributions .",
    "thus we hope that we were able to set up a consistent framework in which the physics of the relevant energy region , apart from the remaining uncertainties in the nonrelativistic and perturbative expansions , has been correctly described .",
    "let us finally summarise the achieved status . in our analysis , several contributions seem to be under good control : the perturbative expansion , as it has been incorporated in our analysis , converges reasonably well .",
    "the condensates only give a negligible contribution to the upsilon or charmonium . on the phenomenological side , for the upsilon",
    "the first six resonances have been measured . for the non - resonant continuum",
    "part , quark - hadron duality has been used . in the charmonium system ,",
    "the experimental situation has improved recently . besides the first six resonances also the cross section between 2.0 gev and 4.8 gev has been measured . above this energy",
    "we again use quark - hadron duality .",
    "nevertheless , the most important contribution is already given by the first two poles .",
    "of decisive importance for the determination of the masses is the threshold behaviour .",
    "the method of qcd sum rules is a very powerful tool to extract the masses since - by the choice of @xmath21 and @xmath16 - it can react very sensitive to the threshold .",
    "thus , large theoretical uncertainties only lead to a relatively small shift in the masses .",
    "the main uncertainties indeed come from the threshold expansion of nrqcd .",
    "the largest potential for an improvement of the analysis lies in a further understanding of this energy region .",
    "in particular , the knowledge of the green s function at nnnlo could help to reduce the error .",
    "the method of qcd sum rules is based on the assumptions of quark - hadron duality . with the development of nrqcd",
    "is has become clear that the pole contributions must be included in the theoretical description for a correct comparison between the theoretical and phenomenological part .",
    "the theoretical description is based on the operator product expansion and can be performed in a perturbative region where all expansions converge well . however , this can not be used for an ever increasing precise determination of the mass . since on the phenomenological side the dependence on the mass originates mainly from the first bound states , the sensitivity on the mass decreases in a similar way as the theoretical expansions improve . in our analysis",
    "we have tried to balance these contributions by an appropriate choice of @xmath16 and @xmath21 . without significant progress in the theoretical description",
    "it seems that further substantial improvement will be difficult to achieve .",
