    "in this work we begin an examination of the unoccupied surface electronic band structure for al(111 ) in the energy range 0  27 ev above the vacuum energy level .",
    "surface - state resonances for these energies are important in understanding surface properties and in the analysis of many surface spectroscopies including e.g. photoemission and inverse photoemission . at present there does not appear to be any other calculation of these bands for this crystal surface .",
    "we will calculate energy states and resonances both below and above vacuum level using the layer - by - layer scattering approach .",
    "the relationship between surface and bulk electron band structure and low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) reflectivities ( or intensities ) has been demonstrated previously .",
    "@xcite such a leed analysis provides one means of verifying the accuracy of the calculated above vacuum level surface band structure .",
    "hence we will also calculate very low energy reflectivities in this energy range to compare with experimental data .",
    "these reflectivities are calculated by the same layer - by - layer scattering method and use the same input information for the crystal surface potentials as the band structure calculation .    for the higher energy range of 60  450 ev above vacuum level successful leed analyses",
    "have been performed for al(111)@xcite and these also reflect the electron energy bands at these energies .",
    "most of these analyses have been at normal incidence for the non - specular beams only since the reflected 00 beam can not be measured directly in the usual leed set - up . geometric structure and electronic properties",
    "have been extracted from these analyses for this energy range .",
    "similarly , surface and bulk energy bands are known for the below vacuum level energy region chiefly from experimental photoemission and inverse photoemission spectroscopies . for the connecting energy range 0  65 ev above vacuum level ,",
    "the surface band structure is essentially unknown .",
    "this energy range is complicated by the significant variation of the complex electron self - energy and also details of the crystal bulk and surface scattering potentials including the surface barrier . by utilizing the known structural and non - structural properties determined from experiment for the adjacent energy ranges we will predict properties for the intermediate energy range that can be verified by beam intensity analysis in very low - energy electron diffraction ( vleed ) and in low energy electron microscopy ( leem ) .",
    "new experimental data is now possible because the leem apparatus can measure the specular 00 beam reflectivity at normal incidence and very low energies .",
    "for the calculation of the surface electronic band structure and vleed reflectivity the same scattering approach is applied .",

    "only the 00 plane wave is propagating in the crystal and the other six plane waves are evanescent or attenuated in space .",
    "the surface band energies arise from normal incidence scattering of the propagating 00 plane wave between the crystal and barrier .",
    "this repeated scattering gives constructive interference and a maximum amplitude of wave function at these two energies as the energy increases from the muffin - tin zero to the top of the barrier .",
    "this corresponds to the electron being trapped in a surface state and temporarily trapped in a series of surface resonances of the crystal .",
    "these energy positions are particularly sensitive to the shape of the barrier because of the @xmath58 ev energy range spanned between them .",

    "2(b ) ( vertical dotted line ) and propagating in the vacuum at 24.49 ev ( vertical dashed line ) .",
    "the minimum at the vertical dotted line indicates the energy of the transition from evanescent to propagating for the six \\{10 } & \\{01 } plane waves in the crystal and is not of the same character as the other minima . in this case",
    "these crystal - emerged plane waves are travelling parallel to the surface and do not produce the surface bands of the crystal .    between 5 ev and the vertical dotted line in fig .",

    "the surface layer of atoms is different from the bulk layers in that there are no neighbouring atom layers on the vacuum side of the top atom layer .",
    "such resonances may be termed tamm - type since they arise from what may be considered the unsymmetrical termination of the crystal at the surface . between the vertical dotted line and 24.49 ev the above six plane waves are propagating in the crystal , are incident at different angles on the surface barrier and interact .",
    "the internally reflected plane waves then become incident on the crystal and scatter from it in a similar way to the 00 plane wave previously considered in the below vacuum level case . from eq .",

    "the rydberg series of resonances is also strong .",
    "although the energy dependence of the inner potential ( also barrier height here ) has not been included , the energy position of the shockley resonance to be found from experiment should still be within a few ev of that found here . also its occurrence does not depend on the detailed variation of @xmath21 since this quantity has reached its maximum value by 15 ev .    in order to illustrate the effect of no internal scattering at the surface barrier",
    "the barrier absorption potential is extended far into the vacuum by letting the half - width @xmath22 approach @xmath68 .",

    "the tamm surface resonance is not affected since it is not associated with the surface barrier extension into the vacuum .",
    "experimental techniques that may detect features due to surface - state resonances above vacuum level energies include vleed / leem , target ( or total ) current spectroscopy ( tcs ) , surface soft - x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( ssxa ) and inverse photoemission spectroscopy ( ips ) .",
    "we have calculated the leed / leem 00 beam reflectivity ( or intensity ) for al(111 ) at 300 k for normal incidence corresponding to @xmath1 for 0  27 ev to match the calculations for the surface band structure by using the same input data as in that calculation .",
    "we use the @xmath17 and @xmath18 scattering matrices in the layer - by - layer method previously described .",
    "the calculation was also extended from 27 to 65 ev in order to gain information about the value of the crystal inner potential @xmath69 , for the higher energy range once experimental data is available .",
    "an energy interval of 0.1 ev was used with 19 beams and 8 phase shifts for energies from 27  65 ev .",
    "the inelastic scattering potential is the same @xmath21 used for the band structure calculation and is shown in figs .  4 & 5 .        figs .",
    "6 & 7 show the calculated reflectivity using a non - reflection barrier for the moruzzi _",
    "et al . _ and snow bulk potentials respectively . here",
    "the bulk is terminated at a surface plane placed at the jellium discontinuity @xmath70 ( half an interlayer spacing parallel to the surface ) .",
    "this step barrier of height @xmath69 at @xmath71 a.u .",
    "allows for transmission and refraction of all beams but no reflection .",
    "hence any features that may depend on the detailed form of the crystal - vacuum interface are not produced .",
    "figs .  6 & 7",
    "show that in this case the main features in the range 0  27 ev are two peaks which arise from the surface - projected bulk - band pseudogaps corresponding to the gaps for zero inelastic scattering shown in figs .",
    "1(a ) & 2(a ) .",
    "the main difference between these two bulk potentials is the width of these gaps and hence the width of the peaks in the 00 reflectivity .",
    "also shown in these figures is the reflectivity for the case of full surface barrier scattering where the occurrence of surface resonances can be included in the calculation . here",
    "both reflection and transmission are included for a surface barrier potential of the same form as that used earlier in the surface band calculation and shown in fig .  3 for the moruzzi _ et al .",
    "_ potential .",
    "surface barrier scattering is specified in the @xmath18 matrix .",
    "the @xmath19 sub - matrix that contains internal amplitude reflection coefficients for beams emerging from the crystal is the same as that used for the surface band structure calculation .",
    "however for the leed case amplitude transmission coefficients for all beams passing through the barrier into the vacuum must also be specified and these are contained in the sub - matrix @xmath72 .",
    "in addition amplitude transmission and reflection coefficients for the incoming incident 00 beam in the vacuum also need to be specified and these are contained in the @xmath73 and @xmath74 sub - matrices .",
    "this incident 00 beam scattering has only a small effect near 0 ev where it is scattering just a few ev above the energy of the barrier height .",
    "6 & 7 indicate the emergence of the \\{10 } & \\{01 } sets of six non - specular beams in the crystal ( dotted vertical line ) and in the vacuum at 24.49 ev ( dashed vertical line ) .    the effect of surface resonances in the reflectivities of leed beams has been explained by mcrae .",
    "@xcite as for the band structure case and shockley - type resonances their occurrence is detected in leed where there is constructive interference in a sustained multiple scattering between surface barrier and crystal substrate for propagating pre - emergent beams .",
    "the energies where this type of scattering occurs corresponds to the electron being temporarily trapped in a surface resonance .",
    "when these non - specular beams become incident on the crystal in the leed case some electron flux is redistributed to the vacuum - emerged 00 beam and other beams .",
    "this is an indirect process that occurs because of internal surface barrier reflection .",
    "there is also the direct process of flux into the vacuum - emerged beams by their single transmission through the surface barrier .",
    "interference between these direct and indirect processes gives fluctuations in the reflectivity of vacuum emerged beams .",
    "as explained by mcrae this can produce a peak , dip or combined peak - dip structure in the reflectivity profiles .",
    "this interference structure is centred at the energy of the surface resonance . for the moruzzi _",
    "potential and barrier this occurs at 14.5 ev in fig .",
    "1(c ) and in fig .",
    "6 we see a wide dip - peak structure centred near 14.5 ev and producing a pronounced peak at 17.5 ev .",
    "also a series of rydberg resonance features occur near the vacuum - level threshold of the \\{10 } & \\{01 } non - specular beams .",
    "the first peak has a fwhm of @xmath75 ev and may be detectable in an experiment with suitable energy resolution .",
    "a similar strong dip - peak structure occurs for the snow bulk potential and barrier at 15.5 ev as shown in fig .",
    "the centre of the leed feature is at a lower energy corresponding to the value of 13.5 ev in fig .",
    "2(c ) and the first rydberg resonance feature has a similar energy width as that for the moruzzi _",
    "potential and barrier .",
    "thus either bulk potential gives a very strong surface resonance feature in the vleed data at 16.5 @xmath76 1 ev .",
    "this feature is wide in energy because the inelastic scattering potential , @xmath21 , has reached its maximum value of 4.1 ev and is of the shockley type where the wavefunction maximum lies close to the crystal .    the tamm - type resonance at @xmath77 ev in figs .",
    "1(c ) & 2(c ) is stronger for the snow potential and barrier and there is a possible indication of its presence in the very weak dip - peak structure in the vleed 00 beam reflectivity near this energy in fig .",
    "7 .    some tcs experimental data @xcite is available that shows the target current @xmath78 and its second derivative @xmath79 .",
    "this data indicates the positions of peaks in the elastic reflection data at @xmath80 , 16.0 and 21.5 ev with respect to @xmath44 and rydberg peaks at higher energies . for comparison with figs .",
    "6 & 7 , the main three peaks are at 9.6 , 11.8 and 17.3 ev with respect to the vacuum level and these results tend to confirm the occurrence of the shockley surface barrier resonance feature near 16.5 @xmath76 1 ev .",
    "the other two lower energy peaks correspond to the surface - projected bulk band pseudogaps . ssxa experimental data @xcite found a surface resonance at 12.1 ev with respect to @xmath44 or 7.9 ev with respect to the vacuum level and this is consistent with the tamm - type resonances at @xmath77 ev in figs .  1 & 2 and at 8.3 ev in fig .  1 .",
    "there is no experimental vleed data for 0  27 ev for this surface of al although there is early data for the ( 100 ) surface that also indicates strong surface resonance features",
    "a tamm surface resonance at 6.9 ev and also possibly one at 8.3 ev , a shockley surface resonance at @xmath2 ev and rydberg ( image ) resonances near 24 ev are predicted in the above vacuum level surface energy band structure at 300 k of al(111 ) at @xmath0 for 0  27 ev .",
    "strong features occur in this energy range in the 00 beam normal incidence vleed reflectivity data due to the shockley and rydberg resonances .",
    "the present surface band structure calculations can be extended to other values of @xmath12 and the vleed reflectivities to other incidence angles to examine the complete surface band structure . before proceeding with these calculations and other refinements such as electron - phonon scattering and energy dependence of the self - energy",
    "it is most desirable to have confirmation of the major features present in the results predicted here for @xmath81 .",
    "the leem experimental apparatus could measure this 00 spectra ( and that of non - specular beams ) for normal incidence at these low energies to confirm the occurrence of these surface resonances and possibly also distinguish between the two bulk al potentials . following this , further experimental data from vleed , leem , tcs and other spectroscopies that includes other incidence angles would then be desirable to further analyse the above vacuum level surface band structure , surface potentials and inelastic processes for al(111 ) .    p. j. jennings and e. g. mcrae , surface sci .",

    "<S> the 2d layer green function scattering method is used to calculate the energy of surface states and resonances at @xmath0 for al(111 ) for both below and above the vacuum level . </S>",
    "<S> the surface barrier potential is represented by an empirical form . </S>",
    "<S> the above vacuum level surface electron band structure for this surface has not been calculated before and it is important in understanding many surface phenomena . the geometric structure of the al(111 ) surface is known from intensity analysis in low - energy electron diffraction at energies 60  450 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the surface barrier for al(111 ) were obtained from a match with the below vacuum level experimental energy position of the first rydberg surface resonance and the shockley surface state at @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation was then extended to the above vacuum level case for 0  27 ev with the inclusion of inelastic electron interactions . </S>",
    "<S> tamm - type resonances at 6.9 ev and possibly also at 8.3 ev , a shockley - type resonance at @xmath2 ev and a series of rydberg ( image ) resonances near 24 ev all above vacuum level are found at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the same 2d layer green function scattering method using the same input data was then used to calculate the intensity of the 00 beam for @xmath1 ( normal incidence ) in very low energy electron diffraction ( vleed ) from this surface in the energy range 0  65 ev . </S>",
    "<S> features in the vleed intensities are found due to the shockley and rydberg resonances . </S>",
    "<S> experimental data from over 26 years ago found surface features near the energies found in this work . </S>",
    "<S> beam intensities from low energy electron microscope ( leem ) measurements at normal incidence and new data from other surface spectroscopies could provide experimental confirmation of the resonances predicted in this work . </S>"
