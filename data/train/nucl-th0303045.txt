    "this work is a continuation of the one presented in ref @xcite , where i discussed multiparticle production at cern - sps energies .",
    "the present article is mainly concerned with higher energies where the efffects of shadowing play a very important role . in the framework of the model presented below",
    ", the shadowing corrections can be computed from high mass diffraction practically without any new free parameter . when the effects of shadowing are taken into account",
    ", the model describes the inclusive charged particle production at rhic as a function of centrality @xcite . a comparison with the results obtained @xcite in the framework of the saturation model is also presented .",
    "another new development concerns net baryon production ( stopping ) .",
    "it is shown that both sps and rhic data can be described with the same mechanism ( and the same values of the parameters ) used in @xmath1 interactions .",
    "this indicates that there is no evidence for an `` anomalous '' stopping in the heavy ion data @xcite .    as already observed at cern - sps , rare processes like strange and multistrange baryon and antibaryon production ,",
    "can only be described with the introduction of some final state interaction between the produced particles ( comovers interaction ) @xcite .",
    "it turns out , however , that the interaction cross - sections required to describe the data are comparatively small ( a few tenths of a mb ) and , in view of the shortness of the interaction time ( @xmath2  fm ) it seem quite improbable that the system can reach thermal equilibrium . in a recent development @xcite reported below , we show that the same formalism of final state interaction used at cern - sps can describe rhic data with the same values of the parameters .",
    "predictions for @xmath3 and @xmath4 production have been confirmed by recent star data .",
    "predictions for @xmath5 and @xmath6 are also given .",
    "finally , we analyze the new na50 data on @xmath0 suppression at cern - sps in the comovers approach @xcite @xcite and discuss expectations at rhic .",
    "the dual parton model ( dpm ) @xcite and the quark gluon string model ( qgsm ) @xcite are closely related dynamical models of soft hadronic interactions .",
    "they are based on the large-@xmath7 expansion of non - perturbative qcd [ 11 - 13 ] and on gribov s reggeon field theory ( rft ) @xcite .",
    "their main aim is to determine the mechanism of multiparticle production in hadronic and nuclear interactions .",
    "the basic mechanism is well known in @xmath8 annihilation ( fig .",
    "the @xmath8 converts into a virtual photon , which decays into a @xmath9 pair . in the rest system of the virtual photon the quark ( with colour 3 ) and the antiquark ( colour @xmath10 ) separate from each other producing one string ( or chain ) of hadrons , i.e. two back - to - back jets .",
    "processes of this type are called one - string processes .    in hadron - hadron interactions ,",
    "a one - string mechanism is also possible but only in some cases , namely when the projectile contains an antiquark ( quark ) of the same type than a quark ( antiquark ) of the target , which can annihilate with each other in their interaction .",
    "for instance in @xmath11 , the @xmath12 of @xmath13 can annihilate with the @xmath14 of @xmath15 and a single string is stretched between the @xmath16 of @xmath13 ( colour 3 ) and a diquark @xmath17 of @xmath15 ( colour @xmath10 ) .",
    "this mechanism is also possible in @xmath18 interactions ( fig .",
    "2 ) but not in @xmath1 .",
    "this already indicates that it can not give the dominant contribution at high energy .",
    "indeed , when taking the square of the diagram of fig .",
    "2 ( in the sense of unitarity ) we obtain a planar graph , which is the dominant one according to the large-@xmath7 expansion .",
    "however , this only means that this graph has the strongest coupling .",
    "since flavour quantum numbers are exchanged between projectile and target , this graph gives a contribution to the total cross - section that decreases as an inverse power of @xmath19 ( @xmath20 . a decrease with @xmath19 is always associated with flavor exchange .",
    "for instance , the charge exchange @xmath21 cross - section also decreases as @xmath22 .",
    "actually , the diagram in fig .  2 corresponds to the exchange of a secondary reggeon , with intercept close to 1/2 .    in order to prevent the exchange of flavour between projectile and target ,",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath14 have to stay , respectively , in the projectile and target hemispheres . since they are coloured , they must hadronize stretching a second string of type @xmath12-@xmath14 .",
    "we obtain in this way a two - string diagram ( figs .",
    "3 - 5 ) ) . taking the square of this diagram",
    ", we obtain a graph with the topology of a cylinder ( fig .",
    "it turns out that this is the simplest topology one can construct which does not vanish as @xmath23 due to flavour exchange .",
    "therefore , we obtain in this way the dominant graph for hadron - hadron scattering at high energy . the diagram in fig .",
    "6 is called a pomeron ( p ) and the graphs in figs .",
    "3 - 5 a cut pomeron .",
    "its order in the large-@xmath7 expansion is @xmath24 [ 12 - 13 ] .",
    "note that due to energy conservation the longitudinal momentum fractions taken by the two systems at the string ends have to add up to unity .",
    "there are also higher order diagrams ( in the sense of the large-@xmath7 expansion ) with 4 , 6 , 8 strings which give non - vanishing contributions at high energy .",
    "an example of the next - to - leading graph for @xmath1 interactions is shown in fig .",
    "7 . it contains four strings  the two extra strings are stretched between sea quarks and antiquarks .",
    "the square of this graph corresponds to a @xmath25 cut and has the topology of a cylinder with a handle .",
    "its order in the large-@xmath7 expansion is @xmath26 .",
    "the one with six strings corresponds to a @xmath27 cut and to the topology of a cylinder with two handles ( order @xmath28 ) , etc .",
    "the single particle inclusive spectrum is then given by @xcite [ 1e ] & & dn^pp dy(y ) = _ n 1 _",
    "n _ n _ n ( n_n^qq - q_v(y ) + n_n^q_v - qq(y ) + ( 2n-2 ) n_n^q_s-_s(y ) ) + & & n_k^qq - q_v(y ) + n_k^q_v - qq(y ) + ( 2k-2 ) n_k^q_s-_s(y )    where @xmath29 is the average number of inelastic collisions . note that each term consists of @xmath30 strings , i.e. two strings per inelastic collisions .",
    "two of these strings , of type @xmath31-@xmath32 , contain the diquarks of the colliding protons .",
    "all other strings are of type @xmath32-@xmath33 .",
    "the weights @xmath34 of the different graphs , i.e. their contribution to the total cross - section , can not be computed in the large-@xmath7 expansion .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the various graphs in the large-@xmath7 expansion and those in perturbative reggeon field theory @xcite .",
    "we use the weights obtained from the latter  with the parameters determined from a fit to total and elastic cross - sections @xcite , @xcite . at sps energies",
    "we get @xmath35 and at rhic @xmath36 at @xmath37  gev and @xmath38 at @xmath39  gev @xcite .    the hadronic spectra of the individual strings @xmath40 are obtained from convolutions of momentum distribution functions , giving the probability to find a given constituent ( valence quark , sea quark of diquark ) in the projectile or in the target , with the corresponding fragmentation functions .",
    "the dependence of @xmath40 on the number of collisions appears via the former .",
    "it is a result of energy conservation .",
    "( the larger the number of strings , the smaller the average invariant mass of each one ) .",
    "momentum distribution and fragmentation functions are largely determined from known regge intercepts @xcite @xcite .",
    "the momentum distribution function of a valence quark in a hadron behaves as @xmath41 . as in the parton model",
    ", this behaviour results from the intercept 1/2 of a reggeon trajectory .",
    "thus , in average , the valence quark in a proton is slow and the diquark is fast due to energy conservation .",
    "both momentum distribution and fragmentation functions are assumed to be universal , i.e. the same in all hadronic and nuclear interactions .",
    "this property gives to the model a great predictive power .",
    "finally , individual strings are assumed to be independent . in this way ,",
    "the hadronic spectra of a given graph are obtained by adding up the corresponding ones for the individual strings .",
    "this leads to a picture , in which , for any individual graph , particles are produced with only short - range ( in rapidity ) correlations .",
    "long - range correlations ( and a broadening of the multiplicity distributions ) are due to fluctuations in the number of strings , i.e. to the superposition of different graphs with their corresponding weights .",
    "this gives a simple and successful description of the data in hadron - hadron and hadron - nucleus interactions @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) to nucleus - nucleus collisions is rather straighforward . for simplicity let us consider the case of @xmath42 collisions and let @xmath43 and @xmath44 be the average number of participants of each nucleus and the average number of binary @xmath45 collisions , respectively . at fixed impact parameter @xmath46 , we have @xcite [ 2e ] & & dn^aa dy(b ) = n_a(b ) + & & + ( n(b ) -",
    "n_a(b ) )  2 k  n_(b)^q_s-_s(y )    @xmath47 and @xmath48 are computed from the standard formulae in the glauber model .",
    "the physical meaning of eq .",
    "( [ 2e ] ) is quite obvious .",
    "the expression in brackets corresponds to a @xmath45 collision .",
    "since @xmath43 nucleons of each nucleus participate in the collision , this expression has to be multiplied by @xmath43 .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) the average number of collisions is @xmath49  and the number of strings @xmath50 . in the present case",
    "the total average number of collisions is @xmath51  and the number of strings @xmath52 . the second term in eq . ( [ 2e ] )",
    "is precisely needed in order to have the total number of strings required by the model .",
    "note that there are @xmath53 strings involving the valence quarks and diquarks of the participating nucleons .",
    "the remaining strings are necessarily stretched between sea quarks and antiquarks .",
    "the value of @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 with @xmath56 @xmath54 represents the total average number of inelastic collisions suffered by each nucleon ( for more details see section 5 ) .",
    "we see from eq .",
    "( [ 2e ] ) that @xmath57 is obtained as a linear combination of the average number of participants and of binary collisions .",
    "the coefficients are determined within the model and depend on the impact parameter via @xmath54 .",
    "note that the presence of a term proportional to the number of binary collisions is a general feature of rft and is not related to minijet production .    as discussed in section 2.1",
    "the average invariant mass of a string containing a diquark at one end is larger than the one of a @xmath32-@xmath33 string since the average momentum fraction taken by a diquark is larger than that of quark .",
    "it turns out that the same is true for the central plateau , i.e.  : @xmath58 .",
    "let us now consider two limiting cases  : [ 3e ] if  n^q_s-_s(y^ * ~0 ) n^qq - q_v ( y^ * ~0 )  ,  dn^aa dy(y^ * ~0 ) ~n_a ~a^1    [ 4e ] if  n^q_s-_s(y^ * ~0 ) ~n^qq - q_v ( y^ * ~0 )  ,  dn^aa dy(y^ * ~0 ) ~n ~a^4/3  .",
    "in the first case we obtain a proportionality in the number of participants @xmath43 whereas in the second case we obtain a proportionality in the number of binary collisions .",
    "since @xmath59 , the latter result implies that @xmath60 , i.e. all unitarity corrections cancel and we obtain the same result as in the impulse approximation ( born term only ) .",
    "this result is known as the abramovsky - gribov - kancheli ( agk ) cancellation and is valid for a general class of models which includes the glauber and eikonal ones .",
    "it implies that , for the inclusive cross - section , soft and hard processes have the same @xmath61-dependence .",
    "however , the agk cancellation is violated by diagrams related to the diffraction production of large - mass states  the so - called triple pomeron or enhanced diagrams .",
    "these diagrams give rise to shadowing corrections as discussed below .",
    "their effect is very important in nuclear collisions since they are enhanced by @xmath62 factors .      in appendix",
    "a , we discuss the physical content of the agk cutting rules and their practical realization in the probabilistic glauber model .",
    "it is shown there that multiple scattering diagrams , resulting from the @xmath19-channel iteration of the born term , give non - vanishing contributions to the total cross - sections ( shadowing ) . however , in the case of the single particle inclusive cross - section , these contributions cancel identically ( agk cancellation ) , provided the measured particle has been produced in an inelastic interaction ( cut pomeron ) . if , on the contrary , the trigger particle is produced in the vertex function ( blob ) of the multiple scattering diagram , one obtains the same shadowing effects than in the total cross - section .",
    "this is the physical origin of the agk violations present in dpm ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "it is clear that if the blob has a small extension in rapidity , production from the blob will mainly contribute to the fragmentation region .",
    "therefore , at mid - rapidities , and sufficient large energy , the agk cancellation will be valid .",
    "let us consider next the contribution to the total cross - section resulting from the diffractive production of large mass states .",
    "clearly , this is equivalent to an increase of the rapidity extension of the blob  which , in this case , can cover the mid - rapidity region .",
    "therefore , shadowing corrections to the single particle cross - section will be present in this case , provided the measured particle is part of the diffractively produced system .",
    "as shown in appendix a , the shadowing correction is just given by the diffractive cross - section with negative sign .",
    "( this is exactly true only for purely imaginary amplitudes ) .",
    "the theoretical expression of the diffractive cross - section is well - known .",
    "an important part is given by the triple - pomeron term .",
    "it has also been measured experimentally and , thus , the shadowing corrections can be computed with no free parameters .",
    "considering for simplicity only the contribution of the triple pomeron term , the effect of the shadowing corrections is obtained @xcite by multiplying eq .",
    "( [ 2e ] ) by    [ 5e ] r_ab(b ) = d^2s  f_a(s )  f_b(b - s ) t_ab(b )    where    [ 6e ] f_a(b ) = t_a(b ) 1 + a  f(s )  t_a(b )  .    here",
    "the function @xmath63 is given by the integral of the ratio of the triple pomeron cross - section @xmath64 at @xmath65 to the single pomeron exchange cross - section @xmath66  :    [ 7e ] .",

    "higher order rescatterings are also present .",
    "they are model dependent .",
    "the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ 5e ] ) correspond to the sum of all `` fan '' diagrams with pomeron branchings ( generalized schwimmer model @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to study the @xmath61-dependence of the shadowing corrections in the limit of large triple pomeron coupling ( when the first term in the denominator of ( [ 6e ] ) can be neglected ) . in this case",
    "we find @xmath78 , i.e. the @xmath79 behaviour resulting from the agk cancellation is reduced to @xmath80 .",
    "this limit was considered by kancheli many years ago @xcite .",
    "note that shadowing corrections to inclusive spectra are not especific to soft processes .",
    "the triple pomeron terms described above are also responsible for shadowing in hard processes .",
    "at sps energies the limit given by eq .",
    "( [ 4e ] ) is not reached , and eq .",
    "( [ 2e ] ) leads to an @xmath61 dependence of @xmath57 at @xmath82 in @xmath83 with @xmath84 only slightly above unity .",
    "( @xmath85 between 2 and 370 participants ) . on the other hand ,",
    "shadowing corrections are small due to phase space limitations ( @xmath86 in eq .",
    "( [ 7e ] ) ) .",
    "the results @xcite for @xmath87 @xmath87 collisions at @xmath88  gev are shown in fig .",
    "we see that both the absolute values and the centrality dependence are well reproduced . when the energy increases , eq .",
    "( [ 4e ] ) shows that the value of @xmath84 should increase towards @xmath89 , in the absence of shadowing corrections .",
    "however , the effect of the latter is increasingly important and , as a result , the value of @xmath84 varies little with @xmath19 . at @xmath37  gev , without shadowing corrections the @xmath61-dependence is @xmath83 , with @xmath90 in the same range of @xmath91  a value which is not far from the maximal one , @xmath92 from eq .",
    "( [ 4e ] ) . with the shadowing corrections",
    "the @xmath61-dependence is much weaker ( lower line of the shaded area in fig .",
    "9 ) @xcite . the @xmath61-dependence is now given by @xmath83 with @xmath93  always in the range of @xmath91 from 2 to 370 .",
    "as we see , the increase of @xmath84 from sps to rhic energies is rather small .",
    "this value of @xmath84 is predicted to change very little between rhic and lhc , where @xmath94 . for , the increase from @xmath90 to @xmath95 obtained in the absence of shadowing is compensated by an increase in the strength of the shadowing corrections , leaving the effective value of @xmath84 practically unchanged .",
    "let us define the ratio    [ 8e ] r_aa(b ) = d^2n^aa / dy  dp_t n(b ) d^2n^pp / dy  dp_t  .    for central @xmath97 @xmath97 collisions at @xmath98 , we find @xmath99 when numerator and denominator are integrated over @xmath96",
    ". clearly this value corresponds to small values of @xmath96 which give the dominant contribution to @xmath100 .",
    "this result is in agreement with the measured values of @xmath101 at @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "this was to be expected from the results presented in fig .",
    "it is interesting that these data , as well as phenix ones @xcite show approximately the same value of @xmath101 at large @xmath96 .",
    "more precisely , the data show a small increase of @xmath101 at moderate @xmath96 and , at large @xmath96 , they show a scaling in the number of participants  rather than in the number of binary collisions .",
    "such a result is expected in the present approach .",
    "indeed , at large @xmath96 the shadowing corrections strongly decrease due to the increase of @xmath103 in @xmath104 ( eq . ( [ 7e ] ) ) . however , the larger threshold at large @xmath96 affects mostly the @xmath32-@xmath33 strings  which have a smaller invariant mass than the @xmath31-@xmath32 ones .",
    "thus , with increasing @xmath96 we approach the limit in eq .",
    "( [ 3e ] ) leading to a scaling in the number of participants .",
    "the small increase of @xmath101 at moderate @xmath96 is probably due to the cronin effect or to a combination of this effect and jet quenching .",
    "recently , it has been shown @xcite that the cronin effect is considerably smaller at rhic and lhc energies than at sps ones due to the change with energy of the coherence length .",
    "in the saturation model , the @xmath61-dependence of charged particle inclusive spectrum in the saturation regime ( i.e. @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the saturation scale ) is given by @xcite    [ 9e ] dn dy  d^2p_t ~a^2/3 _ s ( q_s )  .",
    "comparison with previous section results indicates that , apart from logarithmic factors due to @xmath107 , we obtain the same result as in rft with maximal shadowing . as discussed in the previous section , this result is in violent disagreement with rhic data .",
    "the question is then how a reasonable description of the data has been obtained in @xcite .",
    "the answer is the following .",
    "the authors have considered @xmath100 rather than @xmath108 . by integrating over @xmath109 up to @xmath106 and assuming a @xmath96-broadening corresponding to @xmath110 they have gained one power of @xmath62 .",
    "furthermore , the factor @xmath111 increases the effective power slightly above @xmath112 reaching agreement with experiment .",
    "the problem with this explanation is that a @xmath96-broadening in @xmath62 is much larger than the one seen in the data ( which is of the order of 30  % between peripheral and central collisions ) . in order to describe it a parametrization of the saturation scale",
    "has been introduced in @xcite of the type  :    [ 10e ] p^2_so  .    with this definition , @xmath113 is the value of the saturation scale for the most central collisions ( corresponding to @xmath114 participants ) .",
    "with such an expression of the saturation scale , the @xmath61-dependence of @xmath115 is the same as that of @xmath108 within 30  % and , with the mild @xmath61-dependence of @xmath116 used before , it is not possible to describe the data . in view of that the authors use instead the following expression    [ 11e ] .",
    "_ s^-1 ~    where @xmath117 is chosen to be 0.6 .",
    "note the fine tuning between the 0.61 in the numerator and 0.6 in the denominator of ( [ 11e ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the value of @xmath116 for peripheral collisions is extremely small and @xmath116 increases by a large factor between peripheral and central collisions . with this fine tuning agreement with experiment",
    "is recovered .",
    "note that for peripheral collisions ( @xmath118 ) one is practically sitting on the landau pole ( i.e. the argument of the @xmath119 is very close to unity ) .",
    "note also that with @xmath120  mev , the value of the saturation scale for the most central collisions is very small ( 260 mev ) .    in the saturation model",
    "the @xmath61-dependence of @xmath108 grows larger with increasing @xmath96 and it turns out that the model can reproduce @xcite the measured values of the ratio @xmath101 , eq .",
    "( [ 8e ] ) , in the range 1.5 gev @xmath121  gev .",
    "however , as discussed above the model has an @xmath61-dependence at lower @xmath96 which is too weak .",
    "thus , it is perhaps not surprising that it has the right @xmath61-dependence for larger values of @xmath96 in some range .",
    "the above considerations indicate that saturation is not reached at rhic energies .",
    "the considerations in the previous section based on rft suggest that it will not be reached at lhc either .",
    "in @xmath1 collisions the net proton ( @xmath15-@xmath122 ) distribution is large in the fragmentation regions and has a deep minimum at mid - rapidities .",
    "in contrast to this situation a much flatter distribution has been observed @xcite in central @xmath87 @xmath87 collisions at cern - sps . in view of that , several authors have claimed that the stopping in heavy ion collisions is anomalous , in the sense that it can not be reproduced with the same mechanism ( and the same values of the parameters ) used to describe the @xmath1 data . in a recent paper @xcite",
    "it has been shown that this claim is not correct .    in the model",
    "described in previous sections , the net baryon can be produced directly from the fragmentation of the diquark .",
    "another possibility is that the diquark splits producing a leading meson in the first string break - up and the net baryon is produced in a further break - up . clearly , in the first case , the net baryon distribution will be more concentrated in the fragmentation region than in the second case .",
    "the corresponding rapidity distributions are related to the intercepts of the relevant regge trajectories , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively , i.e. they are given by @xmath125 . here",
    "@xmath126 is the difference between the rapidity of the produced net baryon and the maximal one . in the case of the first component , in order to slow down the net baryon it is necessary to slow down a diquark .",
    "the corresponding regge trajectory is called baryonium and its intercept is known experimentally to be @xmath127 . for the second component , where a valence quark is slowed down , we take @xmath128 . @xcite or @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "we find no evidence for such a component from the existing @xmath1 and @xmath42 data .",
    "its smallness could be related to the fact that it produces an extra string of hadrons and , thus , does not correspond to the dominant topology . ]    in this way we arrive to the following two component model for net baryon production out of a single nucleon    [ 12e ] & & dn_(b ) dy(y ) = a  c _  z_+^1-_q(0)(1 - z_+)^(b ) - 3/2 + n_sq(_(0)-_(0 ) ) + & & + ( 1 - a ) c _  z_+^1- _ qq ( 0 ) ( 1 - z_+)^(b ) - 3/2 + c + n_sq(_(0 ) - _ ( 0 )    where @xmath130 is the number of strange quarks in the hyperon @xmath131 @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath104 is the maximal value of the baryon rapidity and @xmath54 is the average number of inelastic collisions suffered by the nucleon at fixed impact parameter @xmath46 ( see section 2.2 ) . the constants @xmath134 and @xmath135 are obtained from the normalization to unity of each term .",
    "the small @xmath136 behaviour is contro lled by the corresponding intercept .",
    "the factor @xmath137 is obtained by requiring that the @xmath136-fractions of all quarks at the ends of the strings , other than the one in which the baryon is produced , go to zero [ 9 - 10 ] . following conventional regge rules @xcite an extra @xmath138",
    "is added to the power of @xmath139 for each strange quark in the hyperon .",
    "the fraction , @xmath140 , of the db breaking component is treated as a free parameter .",
    "the same for the parameter @xmath141 in the dp component  which has to be determined from the shape of the ( non - diffractive ) proton inclusive cross - section in the baryon fragmentation region .",
    "it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ 12e ] ) that stopping increases with @xmath54 , i.e. with the total number of inelastic collisions suffered by each nucleon .",

    "there was , however , a caveat , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "indeed , there was a mismatch of about 30  % between the absolute normalizations in @xmath209 and @xmath87 @xmath87 .",

    "this result was predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "next , i would like to discuss briefly the expectations for @xmath0 supression at rhic in the comovers interaction model .",
    "the calculation of the survival probability @xmath215 is quite safe . indeed , since @xmath216 is a cross - section near threshold , the same value obtained at sps should be used at rhic .",
    "the situation is quite different for @xmath212 .",
    "many authors assume that @xmath213 is the same at rhic and at sps .",
    "it has also been suggested that it can be significantly larger at rhic .",
    "however , it seems plausible that at mid - rapidities , nuclear absorption at rhic is small due to the fact that , contrary to sps , the @xmath210 pair is produced outside the colliding nuclei .",
    "it is therefore crucial to have data on @xmath0 production in @xmath199 interactions at rhic .",
    "if @xmath229 the @xmath0 suppression at rhic and sps will be comparable since the smallness of the nuclear absorption will be approximately compensated by the increase of the comovers suppression  due to a larger comovers density at rhic .",
    "very preliminary data tend to indicate that this is indeed the case .",
    "a quantitative analysis of the new na50 data in the deconfining scenario is still missing . on the other hand , the centrality dependence of the average @xmath96 of @xmath0 is better described in the comovers approach than in a deconfining scenario @xcite . at rhic energies , a small nuclear absorption in @xmath199 collisions ( i.e. @xmath229 ) , would be a very interesting situation in order to discriminate the comovers interaction model from a deconfining scenario .",
    "indeed , in the latter , the shape of the centrality dependence would be almost flat for peripheral collisions ( below the deconfining threshold ) and would decrease above the threshold .",
    "such a behaviour would be a clear signal of deconfinement .",
    "on the contrary , in the comovers scenario , the fall - off would be continuous , from peripheral to central collisions , and determined by the same value of @xmath216 obtained from cern sps data .",
    "quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation is obtained in statistical qcd , i.e. qcd applied to a system in thermal equilibrium .",
    "therefore , one of the main issues in heavy ions physics is to determine whether or not the produced final state reaches thermal equilibrium .",
    "an argument in favor of equilibrium is the fact that particle abundances are well described in terms of statistical models .",
    "however , one should take into account that statistical models are also very successful in @xmath1 and even @xmath8 interactions .",
    "therefore , it is important to study whether or not particle abundances can be obtained in a microscopic model such as dpm .    as a starting point",
    "we have assumed that particles produced in different strings are independent ( see section 2 ) . in this",
    "case thermal equilibrium can not be reached no matter how large the energy density is .",
    "indeed , in this case a large energy - density is the result of piling up a large number of independent strings .",
    "the assumption of independence of strings works remarkably well in @xmath230 and @xmath231 interactions @xcite @xcite  even in the case of event samples with 5 or 6 times the average multiplicity  indicating that no sizable final state interaction is present in these reactions . in nucleus - nucleus collisions , we have described charged particle inclusive production and its centrality dependence .",
    "the model exhibits a term proportional to the number of binary collisions  which has been seen in the data both at sps and rhic .",
    "the presence of such a term is required by unitarity and is not due to minijets .",
    "however , it is clear that in heavy ion collisions , where several strings occupy a transverse area of 1 @xmath232 , the assumption of string independence has to break down .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "as we have seen , some data can not be described without final state interaction .",
    "it could have happened that this final state interaction is so strong that the string picture breaks down and becomes totally useless .",
    "this does not seem to be the case . on the contrary",
    ", present data can be described using the particle densities computed in the model as initial conditions in the gain and loss ( transport ) equations governing the final state interaction .",
    "the interaction cross - section turns out to be small ( of the order of a few tenths of a mb ) . due to this smallness and to the limited interaction time",
    "available , final state interaction has an important effect only on rare processes , in particular @xmath3 , @xmath5 and @xmath0 production .",
    "the bulk of the final state is not affected .",
    "of course it is not possible to conclude that thermal equilibrium has not reached .",
    "however , particle abundances not only do not allow to conclude that it has been reached , but , on the contrary , their centrality dependence tends to indicate that this is not the case .",
    "let us consider for instance @xmath15 and @xmath122 production . in our model , their yields",
    "are practically not affected by final state interaction , i.e. they are practically the same assuming string independence . yet",
    ", the model reproduces the data , from very peripheral to very central interaction .",
    "this success would be difficult to understand in a qgp scenario in which for peripheral collisions ( below the critical density ) there is strong , non - equilibrated , @xmath233 annihilation , which becomes equilibrated for central ones , above the critical density .",
    "more generally , the qgp scenario would be strongly supported if some kind of threshold would be found in the strange baryon yields around the critical density value . at sps energies ,",
    "evidence for such a threshold in the @xmath4 yield has been claimed by the na57 collaboration @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these data only cover a limited range of centrality .",
    "in contrast to this situation the rhic data explore the whole centrality range from very peripheral to very central collisions and the centrality dependence of the yields of @xmath15 , @xmath162 , @xmath3 and their antiparticles shows no structure whatsoever .",
    "if the same happens for @xmath5 and @xmath6 production ( as predicted in our approach ) the case for qgp formation from strange baryon enhancement will be rather weak .",
    "finally , it should be stressed that the final state interaction of comovers in our approach is by no means a trivial hadronic effect .",
    "indeed , the interaction of comovers starts at the early times where densities , as computed in dpm , are very large .",
    "in this situation the comovers are not hadrons ( there are several of them in the volume occupied by one hadron , and , moreover , at these early times hadrons are not yet formed ) .",
    "this is probably the reason why in our approach the comover interaction cross - sections required to describe the data are smaller than in a hadron gas model .    before concluding , i would like to say that it is an honor and a pleasure to contribute to this special issue of acta physica polonica in hommage to my friend jan kwiecinski",
    "i would also like to acknowledge his important contributions to the model presented here , realized during his ( too rare ) visits to orsay .",
    "in particular he played an important role in the generalization of the dual parton model to heavy ions collisions @xcite and also in introducing @xcite a semi - hard component in the model .",
    "the reggeon calculus or reggeon field theory ( rft ) @xcite provides a field theoretical formulation of the eikonal ( for @xmath230 collisions ) or the glauber ( for @xmath231 and @xmath234 ) models , valid at high energies .",
    "the main difference between the rft and the glauber model is that , at high energies , the coherence length is large and the whole nucleus is involved in the interaction .",
    "moreover , due to the space - time development of the interaction , when , at high energy a projectile interacts inelastically with a nucleon of the nucleus , the formation time of ( most of ) the produced particles is larger than the nuclear size and , thus , particles are produced outside the nucleus . therefore , planar diagrams give a vanishing contribution at high energy .",
    "the relevant diagrams are non - planar , describing the `` parallel '' interactions of constituents of the projectile with the target nucleons ( in the case of an @xmath231 collision ) .",
    "this picture is in clear contrast with the glauber model , in which the projectile undergoes successive ( billiard ball type of ) collisions with the nucleons of the target .    in spite of these differences ,",
    "one recovers the glauber formula in first approximation .",
    "this formula corresponds to the contribution of the initial state ( on - shell projectile pole ) to the various rescattering terms . in rft one",
    "has , besides these contributions , also the contributions due to low mass and high mass diffractive excitations of the projectile .",
    "the latter are very important since , as we have seen in section 2.3 , they give rise to shadowing corrections .          an important feature of rft is that it obeys to the so - called agk cutting rules @xcite .",
    "these rules allow to relate to each other the different @xmath19-channel discontinuities of a given graph , and also to relate them to the contribution of this graph to the total cross - section . in this way",
    ", they provide a powerful link between total cross - section and multiparticle production . in order to illustrate these rules ,",
    "let us consider the case of an interaction of a hadron @xmath235 with two different nucleons of the target nucleus @xmath61 ( with @xmath236 spectators ) , and let us assume that the object exchanged in the @xmath177-channel of each collision is purely imaginary ( pomeron ) .",
    "let us consider the cutting by a plane in between the two interactions ( i.e. in between the two pomerons ) .",
    "we obtain in this way a diffractive intermediate state containing a large rapidity gap .",
    "let us call @xmath237 its contribution to @xmath238 . from the cutting rules we find that the inelastic contribution obtained cutting through one of the interactions ( an interference term ) has a weight @xmath239 relative to the previous one .",
    "since there are two interactions one can cut through , one obtains @xmath240 . finally , cutting by a plane through the two interactions ( which is possible since the graph is non - planar ) has a relative weight @xmath241 .",
    "this last contribution is also inelastic and has an average multiplicity which is twice that of the previous one .",
    "the total contribution of this double scattering , to @xmath238 is thus equal to @xmath242 , a negative contribution .",
    "the total contribution to the non - diffractive inelastic cross - section is @xmath243 .",
    "we see in this way that the ( negative ) contribution of a double interaction to @xmath244 is two times larger , in absolute value that its contribution to @xmath238 . in the case of @xmath44 collisions",
    "the corresponding factor is @xmath245 .",
    "let us now consider the contribution of a double interaction to the non - diffractive single particle inclusive cross - section @xmath246 .",
    "this contribution is @xmath247 .",
    "indeed , in the case of the cut through the two interactions the contribution to @xmath246 has an extra factor 2 since the triggered particle can be produced in either of the two interactions .",
    "it turns out that such a cancellation is true to all orders in the number of interactions .",
    "we obtain in this way the so - called agk cancellation .",
    "all rescattering corrections of the glauber type cancel identically in @xmath246 .",
    "only the term with a single interaction is left  which is proportional to @xmath112 in @xmath199 interactions .",
    "note that the crucial ingredient in obtaining the agk cancellation is the fact that the triggered particle has been produced in a cut interaction  which gives the extra factor 2 for two cut interactions .",
    "the other possibility is that , the trigger particle is emitted from the ( cut ) vertex function ( blob ) .",
    "clearly , in this case the extra factor 2 is absent and the agk cancellation is not valid . in this case",
    "the shadowing corrections are the same as in the total cross - section .",
    "the agk cutting rule described above are quite general .",
    "they are valid in any field theory in which the vertex functions obey the general properties of unitarity , crossing and large @xmath96 damping .",
    "the glauber model is a particular example in which the agk rules are valid .",
    "their derivation in this case is straightforward , as discussed below .",
    "let us consider for simplicity @xmath199 scattering .",
    "the main formula of the probabilistic glauber model is the one that gives the cross - section @xmath34 for @xmath44 inelastic collisions of the projectile with @xmath44 nucleons of the target nucleus , at fixed impact parameter @xmath46  :      where @xmath249 is the proton - nucleon inelastic cross - section and @xmath75 is the nuclear profile function .",
    "this equation is just the bernoulli s formula for composite probabilities .",
    "the first factor is a trivial combinatorial factor corresponding to the different ways of choosing @xmath44 nucleons out of @xmath61 .",
    "the second one gives the probability of having @xmath44 inelastic @xmath250 collisions at given @xmath46 .",
    "the third one is the probability that the remaining @xmath251 nucleons do not interact inelastically .",
    "let us consider first a term with two collisions both of which are inelastic .",
    "the corresponding cross - section is @xmath252 i.e. a positive term .",
    "let us now consider the case of two collisions only one of which is inelastic .",
    "the corresponding ( interference ) term is @xmath253 obtained from eq . ( a.1 ) by putting @xmath254 and taking the second term in the expansion of the last factor .",
    "we get @xmath255 .",
    "we see that @xmath256 .",
    "thus , a rescattering term containing two collisions gives a negative contribution to @xmath238 .",
    "let us now consider the contribution to @xmath257 .",
    "it is given by @xmath258 .",
    "indeed , in the case of a double inelastic collision , the triggered particle can be emitted in either of them  hence an extra factor 2 .",
    "this is just the agk cancellation .",
    "it is easy to see that it is valid order by order in the total number of collisions .",
    "this can also be seen as follows .",
    "the total inelastic cross - section for @xmath199 collision in the glauber model is given by the well known expression      this expression contains a term in @xmath112 ( born term or impulse approximation ) .",
    "it also contains contribution from multiple scattering with alternate signs .",
    "numerically , it behaves as @xmath83 with @xmath260 .",
    "the single particle inclusive cross - section is given by      we see that here multiple - scattering contributions cancel identically and only the born term is left . as a consequence of this agk cancellation the @xmath61-dependence of @xmath246 in @xmath199 interactions behaves as @xmath112 . in the case of @xmath234 collisions",
    "it behaves as @xmath234 and @xmath262 is proportional to the number of binary collisions  rather than to the number of participants .",
    "we see in this way that the agk rules are trivially satisfied in the glauber model . as mentioned in section a.1 in the glauber model only the initial state",
    "is present in the vertex function ( blob ) . thus a secondary can only be produced in an interaction and the agk cancellation is exact . in a general theory with a more complicated vertex function",
    ", the triggered particle may be produced in the blob .",
    "as discussed in section a.2 this gives rise to a violation of the agk cancellation  which is responsible for the shadowing corrections to the inclusive spectra .          in order to get the relative densities of each baryon and antibaryon species we use simple quark counting rules @xcite @xcite . denoting the strangeness suppression factor by @xmath263 ( with @xmath264 ) , baryons produced out of three sea quarks ( which is the case for pair production ) are given the relative weights        for net baryon production , we have seen in section 5 that the baryon can contain either one or two sea quarks .",
    "the first case corresponds to direct diquark fragmentation described by the second term of eq .",
    "( [ 12e ] ) .",
    "the second case corresponds to diquark splitting , described by the first term of ( [ 12e ] ) . in these two cases , the relative densities of each baryon species",
    "are respectively given by            in order to take into account the decay of @xmath275 into @xmath276 , we redefine the relative rate of @xmath162 s and @xmath277 s using the empirical rule @xmath278 )  keeping , of course , the total yield of @xmath162 s plus @xmath277 s unchanged . in this way",
