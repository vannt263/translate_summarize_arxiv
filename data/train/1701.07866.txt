    "this study reviews manifestations of minimum - bias ( mb ) dijets in the hadronic final state of high - energy nuclear collisions in the context of claimed collectivity ( flows ) in the same systems .",
    "there is widespread belief that hydrodynamic flows play a dominant role in high - energy collisions wherein a dense medium ( quark - gluon plasma or qgp ) is formed that supports a collective velocity field manifested by features of hadron distributions  @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible that at least some data features attributed to flows may relate to mb dijets  @xcite . in order to clarify such ambiguities mb dijets",
    "should be understood in ,  and   collisions in relation to eventwise - reconstructed ( isolated ) jets derived independently from  and  collisions over a broad range of collision energies .",
    "that is the main goal of this study .",
    "flows and qgp are intimately related by the assumption that a dense , strongly - interacting medium developed during nucleus - nucleus (  ) collisions should respond to initial - state energy- and matter - density gradients by developing a velocity field ( various flows ) whose consequences may be observed in the hadronic final state  @xcite .",
    "observation of flow manifestations and a causal relation to   initial - state geometry is sought _ a priori _ and interpreted to imply that a qgp has been established  @xcite .",
    "flow - qgp claims then rely on assignment of certain data features to flows and may refer to others as `` nonflow '' without further elaboration  @xcite . the flow - qgp narrative forms the basis for other data analysis and interpretation , and mb jet contributions may be minimized by preferred analysis methods and interpretation strategies .",
    "the flow narrative is related to data by an assumption that most hadrons emerge from `` freezeout '' of a locally - thermalized , flowing dense medium  @xcite .",
    "hadron  is divided into several intervals with specific physical interpretations : thermalization and flows for @xmath1 gev / c  @xcite , high-  jet phenomena for @xmath2 gev / c  @xcite and an intermediate region where production mechanisms are debated  @xcite .",
    "such assumptions provide a preferred context for analysis and interpretation of high - energy data .",
    "for example , transverse - momentum  spectra may be fitted with a monolithic model function interpreted to reflect a thermodynamic context and to measure radial flow  @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) angular correlations are projected onto periodic 1d azimuth @xmath3 and represented by fourier series wherein each fourier term is interpreted to represent a type of transverse flow  @xcite .",
    "charge and  fluctuations are addressed with statistical measures motivated by thermodynamic assumptions including some degree of local thermalization of a bulk medium .",
    "intensive ratios or _ ratios of ratios _ are preferred over extensive measures of collision observables such as integrated charge multiplicity  or integrated @xmath4 within some angular domain  @xcite .",
    "jet contributions are acknowledged only within restricted  intervals including a small fraction of all hadrons , and assumed jet properties are based on conjecture rather than actual jet measurements  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the properties of eventwise - reconstructed dijets , their fragment momentum distributions ( fragmentation functions or ffs )  @xcite and jet ( leading - parton ) energy spectra  @xcite measured over thirty years predict quantitatively certain manifestations of mb dijets that appear in high - energy collision data  @xcite .",
    "predictions from _ isolated - jet _ measurements [ as opposed to perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) theory with its limitations ] are inconsistent with much of the flow narrative and its presumed basis in measurement as discussed below .    in this study",
    "i examine the process of measure design in several critical areas and compare competing analysis methods .",
    "i demonstrate how measured properties of isolated jets predict certain data features from nuclear collisions corresponding to mb dijets and how analysis methods motivated by the flow narrative may lead to attribution of the same features to flows .",
    "i show how a two - component ( soft + hard ) model ( tcm ) of hadron production in high - energy collisions emerges naturally from inductive analysis of  spectrum and correlation data , is not imposed _ a priori _ , and how the tcm is manifested in other contexts .",
    "a number of examples are presented .",
    "i conclude that when data features are reexamined in the context of isolated - jet measurements little substantial evidence remains to support the flow narrative .",

    "a specific combination of methods contributing to a published analysis may comprise a subset of available methods determined by a sequence of choices among alternatives , possibly guided by a preferred narrative . in a given context ( e.g.  sp spectra or pair angular correlations ) alternative selections may lead to significantly different physical interpretations of collision data . for instance , each of extensive measures @xmath4 and @xmath24 or their ensemble means @xmath25 and @xmath26 may reveal certain data trends inconsistent with a temperature hypothesis but supporting an alternative hypothesis whereas fluctuations of intensive eventwise @xmath27 or systematics of ensemble @xmath28 may be seen as reflecting local temperature variations of a conjectured bulk medium .",
    "critical extensive trends may be suppressed by cancellations within intensive ratios .",
    "hadron pair correlations from high - energy nuclear collisions projected onto 1d azimuth exhibit strong nonuniformities ( literally `` azimuthal anisotropy '' ) that may originate from several physical mechanisms including mb dijets . however , the term `` anisotropic flow '' is commonly interpreted as synonymous with azimuthal anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "any distribution on periodic azimuth , no matter what its physical origins , can be described exactly by a fourier series ( fs ) .",
    "the assertion `` the second fourier coefficient of the azimuthal asymmetry [ i.e.  anisotropy ] is called elliptic flow ''  @xcite reflects a common assumption .",
    "alternative modeling of azimuth distributions may favor a different physical interpretation .",
    "this study emphasizes manifestations of mb dijets from high - energy nuclear collisions within several contexts ( e.g.  yields , spectra , correlations , statistical fluctuations ) and their relation to selection of specific analysis methods : how are mb dijets , consistent with measured isolated - jet properties , revealed or concealed by method choices , and what criteria would insure conscious and unbiased choices that lead to meaningful interpretations ?",
