    "granular materials consist of assemblies of particles with sizes ranging from 10@xmath7 to 1@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "this class of materials is probably the most important form of matter in the universe and the second most ubiquitous on earth after water .",
    "the knowledge of its flow as a dense mass is relevant to phenomena such as mud , rock , and snow avalanches , transport of most technologically processed materials , transport of agricultural grains , etc ,  @xcite .",
    "low - density granular material appears in sand storms , smoke , and in interstellar sparse solid material .",
    "although the flow of granular matter has similarities with the flow of ordinary fluids , there is a profound difference between the two and that is in the way energy is dissipated . in normal fluids",
    "mechanical energy is not really dissipated , it is just transferred from long into short scale disturbances of the flow that can be interpreted as heat . in granular matter , on the other hand , the interaction among the grains dissipates mechanical energy by storing it in intragrain degrees of freedom .",
    "the dynamical properties of granular systems have been studied experimentally by many authors . in this context , experimentalists have considered various standard geometries for agitating granular systems , e.g. , horizontal and vertical vibration on a platform  @xcite pouring on an inclined plane and through a chute  @xcite , rotation in a drum  @xcite , etc .",
    "all of these experimental situations give rise to diverse examples of pattern formation , which have been of much research interest  @xcite .",
    "the problem of granular gases , which is theoretically more accessible than the dense system , received considerable attention in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the leading theoretical approach was to concentrate on inelastic binary collisions , where the scattering of a pair of grains is characterized by a constant coefficient of restitution less than unity  @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting problems studied within that approach is cooling and pattern formation .",
    "the system cools down due to the binary collisions , which are inelastic due to the incomplete restitution . in the early stages , it is in the homogeneous cooling state ( hcs ) , with the uniform density field .",
    "however , later in time , the density field becomes unstable to fluctuations and the system enters an inhomogeneous cooling state ( ics ) , where particle - rich clusters are formed and grow .",
    "the decay of temperature , which is the manifestation of the kinetic energy , has been well studied in the hcs  @xcite as well as ics  @xcite .",
    "non - maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution , e.g. , power laws , stretched exponential , etc . , have been reported in various studies  @xcite .",
    "the complex pattern dynamics of density and velocity fields have been studied by puri _",
    ", by invoking analogies from studies of phase ordering dynamics .",
    "the growth kinetics of the clusters in density and velocity fields have also been studied  @xcite .    in the case of dense flows ,",
    "many particles rub against each other simultaneously and stay in prolonged contact . thus",
    ", the concept of collision is not very useful .",
    "it seems , however , that the forces between touching grains are well understood : they can be decomposed in a force normal to the plane of contact and a solid friction force within that plane .",
    "therefore , it may be expected that a continuum description can be achieved by coarse graining of the microscopic system  @xcite .",
    "in fact , a few continuous descriptions of the flow of dense granular matter , not inconsistent with the idea that solid friction is the mechanism of energy dissipation , had been published in the past  @xcite .    the high - density picture where solid friction is essential motivates our present study . in the case of granular gases cooling by inelastic binary collisions",
    ", it is well - known that the evolution of density , velocity , and granular temperature fields can be described by macroscopic hydrodynamic equations  @xcite .",
    "however , there are no corresponding hydrodynamic equations in the literature that can describe dense granular flow .",
    "an important and challenging issue in the physics of granular materials is to obtain a continuum description of dense granular flows . in this context",
    ", a major bottleneck has been a lack of proper understanding of the formation and evolution of plugs or clusters in dense granular flows . in this paper , we study the effect of the dissipation mechanism based on solid friction in granular gases .",
    "although we believe that solid friction is the most significant dissipation mechanism in dense systems , we apply it here to gaseous granular matter , as the only mechanism of mechanical energy dissipation , to isolate this mechanism and study its effect on the cooling properties of such dilute systems .",
    "this will serve also as a test bed for future work on denser systems . also , even in the present work , high - density regions appear due to clustering , to be discussed later , and in those regions solid friction should be indeed the dominant energy dissipation mechanism .",
    "we present results for velocity distributions , ordering dynamics of the density and velocity fields , and the growth dynamics of clusters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe our model and numerical results obtained therefrom .",

    "any two particles with position vectors @xmath10 and @xmath11 interact via a two - body potential with a hard core and a thin shell repulsive potential . to be specific ,",
    "we choose the potential to be of the following form @xmath12 where r=@xmath13 is the separation between the two particles , @xmath14 is the amplitude of the potential , and @xmath15 . here , eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) is to be taken only as a model of repulsive potential that rises steeply from zero at the outer boundary of the shell to infinity at the hard core .",
    "the normal force applied by particle @xmath16 to particle @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 where the gradient is taken with respect to @xmath19 .",
    "the corresponding solid friction force is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the linear velocities of particles @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "equation  ( [ ff ] ) reduces to the well - known coulomb s friction force when the thickness of the thin repulsive shell tends to zero , i.e. , @xmath23 . in that limit",
    ", our model reduces to a hard sphere model where the velocity difference can not have a normal component at the contact point .",
    "thus , the frictional force becomes tangential to the normal force .",
    "for simplicity , we did not consider rotational motion of the grains .",
    "we use the following units for various relevant quantities : lengths are expressed in units of @xmath24 , temperature in @xmath25 , and time in @xmath26 . for the sake of convenience and numerical stability , we set @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 . the velocity verlet algorithm  @xcite is implemented to update positions and velocities of the md simulations .",

    "the system is allowed to evolve until @xmath41 with @xmath48 , i.e. , the elastic limit .",
    "the system is thus relaxed to a maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) velocity distribution , which serves as the initial condition for our md simulation of inelastic spheres with @xmath49 .",

    "however , at the later stage , the formation of clusters is observed .",
    "this cluster formation can be explained as follows .",
    "consider some fluctuations in the homogeneous phase of the density .",
    "particles in the high - density regions lose more energy than those in the low - density regions .",
    "particles entering randomly from the adjacent low - density surrounding regions have finite probability to be trapped within the high - density region . that probability increases with the number of particles in the region , thus increasing the density fluctuations .",

    "the velocity field remains random .",
    "correlations develop in the velocity field at a later time because solid friction between touching ( shell overlap ) particles causes velocity matching .",
