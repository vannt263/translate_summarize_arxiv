    "confining the carriers to a nanometer - scale volume of a semiconductor nanostructure not only leads to qualitative modification of the energy spectrum but also changes the relative role of various kinetic processes that take place in these systems .",
    "in particular , it has been proposed @xcite that an enhancement of impact ionization processes in nanostructures can be exploited to increase the efficiency of solar cells by enabling multiple exciton generation ( meg ) upon absorption of a single high - energy photon . in spite of the initial controversy concerning the actual efficiency of this process @xcite , which arouse from the experimental difficulty in extracting the real meg yields @xcite , direct measurements of photocurrent from nanocrystal - based structures @xcite confirm the initial expectation that efficiency enhancement due to the meg process is feasible .    in the single - particle picture ,",
    "only the transitions leading to creation of a single electron - hole pair ( exciton ) are optically active .",
    "therefore , the meg process requires coulomb interactions that couple configurations with different numbers of excitons .",
    "such inter - band coulomb couplings are indeed present in semiconductor nanocrystals and can be theoretically computed by various methods @xcite . in their presence , there are various scenarios that can lead to the meg effect .",
    "for instance , one can think of a sequential process in which the initially created high - energy exciton subsequently decays into the biexciton states that form a quasi - continuum with very high density of states at sufficiently high energies .",
    "the rates for such a process have been calculated using atomistic methods @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "biexciton states can be created coherently due to the coulomb - induced mixing between the single - exciton ( x ) and biexciton ( bx ) states @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "admixture of bx states to x states increases the average number of excitons in the resulting few - particle eigenstate , while admixture of certain x states to bx states can make the latter optically active . as a result",
    ", the nanocrystal state emerging from a single photon absorption can involve more than one electron - hole pair on the average .    in this paper",
    ", we estimate the efficiency of meg resulting from the admixture mechanism in an inas nanocrystal .",
    "we use the method for calculating the coulomb couplings between x and bx states based on the envelope function ( ) approach developed in our previous paper @xcite , which is a low - cost approximate method that allows us to build statistics over very many x and bx states in a broad energy window and for a distribution of nanocrystal sizes .",
    "the predicted efficiencies are in the range of several up to 50% for photon energies below 5  ev , which is roughly consistent with experimental findings @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we present the model and the method used to estimate the efficiencies . the results are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] . sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] concludes the paper .",
    "we use the simple model of a spherical nanocrystal as in ref .",
    "the carrier states are modeled by single - band wave functions with envelopes corresponding to a simple spherical potential well with infinite barriers , with a constant hole effective mass and a self - consistent , energy - dependent electron mass @xcite .",
    "thus , each single particle state is characterized by the band and the three quantum numbers @xmath0 for the envelope wave function .",
    "two kinds of few - particle configurations are relevant here : the first group are optically active ( bight ) states with one electron - hole ( e - h ) pair , referred to as single exciton ( x ) states . in our model , for such states to be bright ( in the sense of a dipole - allowed transition ) , the quantum numbers @xmath1 of the electron and the hole must be the same , while the values of @xmath2 must be opposite .",
    "in addition , the band angular momentum ( `` spin '' ) projection of the hole must be specified to fully characterize the state .",
    "only the states with holes from the @xmath3 valence band can be bright .",
    "the second group are states with two e - h pairs , referred to as biexciton ( bx ) states .",
    "these are labeled by the full set of quantum numbers for the two electron and two hole states , as well as the spin ( singlet - triplet ) configuration of the two electrons and the subband ( `` spin '' ) configuration of the two holes",
    ".    only the diagonal ( first order ) coulomb correction to the energies of x and bx states as well as the electron and hole exchange energies for the bx states are taken into account .",
    "this is done on the usual mesoscopic level of envelope functions .",
    "in addition , the intraband coulomb coupling ( i.e. , coupling between configurations with a different number of e - h pairs ) , which is relevant for the effect to be discussed here , is included .",
    "on the mesoscopic level , these coulomb terms vanish in the single band approximation due to orthogonality of bloch functions @xcite , hence they are taken on the microscopic level involving the bloch functions , in the first order of the expansion in terms of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the lattice constant and @xmath6 is the nanocrystal radius ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "all the coulomb couplings taken into account include both the direct interaction term as well as interaction mediated by surface polarization which is due to the dielectric discontinuity on the nanocrystal border .",
    "here we only include couplings corresponding to creation of an e - h pair with electron intraband relaxation , with the other hole being a `` spectator '' .",
    "the values of all the parameters , corresponding to an inas nanocrystal , are as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an inhomogeneous ensemble of nanocrystals is modeled by assuming a gaussian distribution of nanocrystal radii @xmath7 , with the average @xmath8 and standard deviation @xmath9 . in practice ,",
    "the size dependence of the coulomb couplings is given by a simple @xmath10 or @xmath11 scaling @xcite , while the energies have been computed for 7 values of @xmath6 in the range @xmath12  mev and approximated by a quadratic fit , which yields a good quantitative approximation in the required range of nanocrystal radii .",
    "the bx admixture to an x state @xmath13 in a nanocrystal of a given radius is obtained ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) by diagonalizing the hamiltonian including only the x state in question and the bx sates @xmath14 directly and sufficiently strongly coupled to @xmath13 .",
    "the criterium for the selection of these `` sufficiently strongly coupled '' bx states out of the infinite number of such states is as follows : if @xmath15 is the magnitude of the coupling matrix element between the two states and @xmath16 is the energy separation between them , then a given state bx is included if the ratio @xmath17 is larger than @xmath18 .",
    "note that @xmath19 is the perturbative measure of the admixture of a given state bx to x. after diagonalization of the hamiltonian constructed in this way , we select the eigenstate @xmath20 with the highest x contribution as the new nominally single - exciton state and its bx admixture is determined as @xmath21    in the calculation of the meg efficiency as a function of the photon energy , we need the relative absorption by a given state and the resulting number of e - h pairs . for a nominally single - exciton state ,",
    "the former is proportional to the brightness @xmath22 of this state , where the nominal brightness @xmath23 for a heavy - hole exciton and @xmath24 for a light - hole exciton .",
    "the contribution of this state to the overall absorption of an inhomogeneous ensemble is @xmath25 . on the other hand ,",
    "its relative contribution to the e - h pair production is @xmath26 .",
    "the x admixture to bright bx states is determined in a similar way .",
    "we diagonalize the hamiltonian containing only the bx state in question ( denoted @xmath27 ) and all the bright x states @xmath28 directly and sufficiently strongly coupled to the bx state ( those for which @xmath29 ) .",
    "we identify the eigenstate @xmath30 which has the biggest bx component and treat it as the new , corrected bx state .",
    "the single - exciton admixture to this state is equal to @xmath31 the brightness of the bx states is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the admixtures of various x states and their nominal brightness , respectively ( in the vast majority of cases , there is only one sufficiently strongly coupled x state ) .",
    "the relative contribution to the absorption is @xmath25 and the relative contribution to the e - h pair production is @xmath35 .    in practice , since the largest coulomb couplings found for our model of the nanocrystal with a 3  nm radius are around 40  mev , we include admixed states with energies up to 10  ev ( in the whole relevant range of radii ) in order to provide quantitatively correct results in the 5  ev energy range of interest .",
    "we then simulate an inhomogeneous nanocrystal ensemble by sampling the radius distribution at 0.003  nm intervals and compute the dependence of the meg efficiency on energy as a histogram with the energy axis divided into finite bins of @xmath36  mev width .",
    "in the energy bin @xmath37 with a central energy @xmath38 , the total absorption rate is calculated ( up to a constant factor ) as @xmath39 where @xmath40 numbers the nanocrystals in the simulated ensemble , @xmath41 runs through all the x and bx states , @xmath42 is the heavyside step function , and we have explicitly witten the @xmath6-dependence of the energy and brightness of the state @xmath41 .",

    "[ fig : xmixture](a , b ) we show the bx admixture to a few selected low - energy states ( the exact information on the energies is contained in the appendix ) as a function of the radius @xmath6 .",
    "the value of this admixture remains very low even for states up to 1  ev above the lowest bx state , which is due to selection rules that exclude coupling between excited bright x states and the lowest bx states @xcite .",
    "the admixture to x states with @xmath48 hole spin projection is typically slightly higher than to those with @xmath46 hole spin .",
    "[ fig : xmixture](c , d ) presents the bx admixture for selected states with higher energies . in general , much higher values are obtained in this case .",
    "the @xmath6 dependence clearly has a resonant character and peaks for some nanocrystal radii , when the coupled x and bx states cross . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xmixture](c , d ) , there is only very weak dependence on the value of the quantum number @xmath2 and on the hole spin projection in the x state .",
    "x admixture to selected bx states.,width=257 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : bxmixture ] shows the admixture of x states to bx states . in most cases , this value does not exceed @xmath18 , irrespective of the energy of a given bx state ( see appendix for detailed information on the states selected for this figure ) hence these states remain nearly completely dark",
    "however , as illustrated by the case ( 3 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : bxmixture ] , resonant enhancement of the admixture may happen in the case of a resonance between the chosen bx state and one of the x states .",
    "then , in a relatively narrow peak , admixture reaches 0.5 . in spite of the large number of states",

    "[ fig : etameg ] shows the dependence of the meg efficiency on the photon energy . in a nearly homogeneous ensemble of nanocrystals ( fig .",
    "[ fig : etameg](a ) ) , the efficiency reaches 1 in certain energy intervals .",
    "comparison with the absorption spectrum shows that this happens only for energies where absorption is nearly absent .",
    "clearly , the reason for such an efficient biexciton generation is the discrete nature of the single exciton density of states : in a weakly inhomogeneous ensemble there are extended energy intervals where no bright single exciton states are present so that all the absorption originates from the quasi - continuous background of nearly purely biexcitonic states .",
    "this picture is different in an ensemble of nanocrystals with a broader size distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : etameg](b ) ) .",
    "now both the absorption and the meg efficiency become quasi - smooth functions of the photon energy and both grow nearly monotonically .",
    "the onset of the meg ( the meg threshold ) is clearly marked at 3.5  ev , which should be contrasted with the nominal onset of the bx density of states at @xmath54  ev for @xmath49  nm .",
    "the evolution of the energy dependence of the meg efficiency with increasing inhomogeneity is shown in more detail in fig .",
    "[ fig : etameg](c ) . here",
    "one can see that already at @xmath55  nm the overlap of the inhomogeneously broadened absorption peak is sufficient to suppress the large values of the efficiency , leafing only a few marked maxima .",
    "these meg efficiency peaks are then washed out as the inhomogeneity grows further .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : etameg](d ) we show the meg efficiency for three ensembles with different average nanocrystal radii .",
    "the two features that can be noticed are the a shift of the meg threshold towards lower energies and larger overall values of the meg efficiency for larger nanocrystals .",
    "we have estimated the quantum efficiency of the multiple exciton generation via coherent , coulomb - induced mixing of bright exciton and biexciton states .",
    "although the mixing is , in general , rather weak due to small values of the coulomb coupling elements ( not exceeding a few tens of mev ) , it can become much stronger near the crossing point between the x and bx energies at particular values of the nanocrystal radius .",
    "the relatively low computational cost of the envelope function method used in our calculations has allowed us to include all the relevant states in a 10  ev energy window .",
    "an interesting property that emerges from our calculations is the high meg yield in the energy intervals where the single exciton density of states vanishes in a weakly inhomogeneous ensemble .",
    "although this result has been obtained in our simple model of nanocrystal wave functions , it essentially follows from the discrete nature of single - exciton spectrum for moderate energies and the much more dense , quasi - continuous spectrum of biexciton states .",
    "therefore , it should be a general feature of highly homogeneous nanocrystal ensembles . whether this can be exploited in applications",
    "depends on the technological feasibility of building a structure in which the very weak absorption of biexciton states is accumulated to yield a considerable overall carrier injection .",
    "in contrast , for less homogeneous nanocrystal ensembles , both the absorption and meg efficiency are smooth functions of the photon energy , with a threshold at about 3.5  ev for nanocrystals with 3  nm radius , which is 1  ev above the formal onset of the biexciton density of states .",
    "the threshold shifts to lower energies for larger nanocrystals .",
    "the efficiencies of the meg process reach 50% for the photon energies about 5  ev and average radius of 3.0  nm and increase for larger nanocrystals .",
