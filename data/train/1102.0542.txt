    "( indeed , such a triangulation necessarily contains two vertex - disjoint @xmath11-simplices , and hence has at least @xmath12 vertices . moreover , if @xmath9 had only @xmath12 vertices , it would be a full - dimensional subcomplex of the boundary complex of the @xmath13-dimensional cross polytope , which is a combinatorial @xmath11-dimensional sphere .",
    "this is however impossible as no closed manifold but a sphere is embeddable in a sphere of the same dimension . )",
    "the natural question is then whether there exist cs triangulations of @xmath10 with exactly @xmath0 vertices .",
    "our main theorem is a _ positive _ answer to this question .",
    "the first result in this series is due to khnel and lassmann @xcite who constructed a cs @xmath0-vertex triangulation of @xmath14 for all @xmath15 .",
    "this appears to be the only infinite family of cs triangulations of products of spheres ( with @xmath0 vertices ) that was known until now .    in his doctoral thesis @xcite ,",
    "sparla constructed a cs 12-vertex triangulation of @xmath16 , see also @xcite , and conjectured that there exists a cs @xmath17-vertex triangulation of @xmath18 for every @xmath19 .",
    "lutz @xcite , with an aid of computer programs manifold_vt and bistellar , confirmed this conjecture for @xmath20 and @xmath21 as well as found many cs @xmath0-vertex triangulations of @xmath10 for @xmath22 .",
    "very recently , effenberger @xcite proposed a certain construction of cs simplicial complexes with @xmath17 vertices that conjecturally triangulate @xmath23 ; with the help of the software package _ simcomp _",
    "he then verified that this indeed holds for all values of @xmath24 , thus establishing sparla s conjecture up to @xmath25 .",
    "our main result provides a cs @xmath0-vertex triangulation of @xmath10 for _ all _ nonnegative integers @xmath26 , and in particular settles sparla s conjecture in full generality . in the following ,",

    "further , lutz @xcite has shown that no cs triangulation of @xmath35 on @xmath36 vertices admits a vertex - transitive action by a cyclic group of order @xmath36 , and no cs triangulation of @xmath37 on @xmath38 vertices admits a vertex - transitive action by a dihedral group of order @xmath39 .",
    "as such , the parity distinction in theorem [ main - s ] can not be avoided .",
