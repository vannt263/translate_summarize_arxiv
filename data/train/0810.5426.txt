    "the discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating @xcite , which can be interpreted as due to a cosmological constant @xmath0 , has triggered a lot of recent works with the aim to study how @xmath0 affects e. g. celestial mechanics and the motion of massive bodies . in principle the cosmological constant should take part in phenomena on every physical scale .",
    "for instance , it has been studied which limits on @xmath0 can be put from solar system measurements , such as the effect on the perihelion precession of the solar systemplanets @xcite .",
    "the cosmological constant could also influence gravitationallensing @xcite and play a role in the gravitational equilibrium of large astrophysical structures @xcite . a natural question which arises",
    "is how the cosmological term affects gravitational waves .",
    "clearly , we expect such an effect to be very tiny , nonetheless we believe that it is worthwhile to investigate it given the ongoing efforts in upgrading or building gravitational wave observatories either earth bounded or in space .",
    "in this paper we study gravitational waves in spacetimes with a nonvanishing cosmological constant @xmath0 in the framework of perturbation theory with respect to de sitter ( ds ) and anti  de sitter ( ads ) metrics .",
    "there are few articles in the literature devoted to the question on how the cosmological constant affects gravitational waves .",
    "some approaches consider exact solutions of the einstein s equations with a cosmological term relying on the kundt class of spacetimes , which admit a non - twisting and expansion ",
    "free null vectorfield @xcite . in @xcite",
    "these spacetimes are interpreted as plane gravitational waves with polarizations `` @xmath1 '' and `` @xmath2 '' which propagate on ds and ads backgrounds .",
    "a perturbative approach different from ours can be found in @xcite , where the einstein equations with a cosmological term are linearised with respect to a minkowski background metric . by choosing a particular non hilbert gauge",
    "this leads then to a klein  gordon equation and thus to a nontrivial dispersion relation .",
    "furthermore , we refer to some works on the scalar wave equation in ds and schwarzschild - ds spacetimes @xcite .",
    "these treatments are , however , not directly connected to the present work , since the equations resulting from the linearisation of einstein s equations are coupled partial differential equations for six independent variables .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section ii we derive the linearised einstein equations with respect to a ds or ads background , which are represented by some generalized klein  gordon equations . since a closed exact solution is not evident , we examine in section iii a perturbation expansion of these equations up to linear order with respect to @xmath0 . in section",
    "iv we calculate the corresponding first order contributions to the amplitudes .",
    "the effects on directly measurable quantities are discussed in section v.    for the details of the linearisation of the einstein equations with respect to an arbitrary differentiable background metric we refer e. g. to the textbooks @xcite or the review @xcite .",
    "as far as notation is concerned : greek letters denote spacetime indices and range from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , whereas latin letters denote space indices and range from @xmath5 to @xmath4 .",
    "if not stated otherwise , we use geometrical units ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "let @xmath8 be a 4-dimensional lorentz manifold with metric @xmath9 of signature @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath11 , resp .",
    "@xmath12 , denote the ricci tensor , resp .",
    "scalar , of @xmath9 . then the vacuum einstein equations with cosmological term read @xmath13 in what follows we consider a perturbed metric @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a static background metric and @xmath16 is a non ",
    "static perturbation with @xmath17 . up to first order in @xmath18",
    "the indices are uppered and lowered by @xmath15 . indicating the unperturbed riemann tensor by @xmath19 and consequently the ricci tensor , resp .",
    "scalar , by @xmath20 , resp .",
    "@xmath21 , we can write the expansion of equation ( [ einstein ] ) up to linear order in @xmath16 as @xmath22 where the linear contributions to the ricci tensor @xcite and ricci scalar are @xmath23 the semicolon denotes the covariant derivative with respect to @xmath15 .",
    "the terms in ( [ exph ] ) which are independent of @xmath16 satisfy equation ( [ einstein ] ) with @xmath15 , @xmath24 the terms linear in @xmath16 are determined by @xmath25 in order to see explicitly the klein",
    " gordon character of ( [ linear1 ] ) , we rewrite this equation using the expressions in equation ( [ linricci ] ) and the trace - reversed quantity @xmath26 , @xmath27 . we are then left with @xmath28 in contrast to the corresponding result for the einstein s equations without cosmological term ( where instead of eq.([linear1 ] ) we have @xmath29 @xcite ) , the equations ( [ linear2 ] ) feature in addition the two last terms .    in order to analyse further the equations ( [ constant ] ) and ( [ linear2 ] ) we fix the background as follows .",
    "it is well known that a ds resp .",
    "ads metric solves the equations ( [ einstein ] ) exactly . for our purposes",
    "it is thus the natural choice for the background .",
    "we note that at this point a schwarzschild  de sitter solution might have been chosen as well . we avoid this since we are interested in a region of spacetime which is far from sources of gravitational radiation .",
    "we now choose an appropriate coordinate system for the background spacetime @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath31 be the locus of an observer at rest @xcite and let @xmath32 , @xmath33 be a coordinate chart such that @xmath34 .",
    "an exact solution of ( [ constant ] ) in the chart @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "the solution ( [ desitter ] ) is valid inside the null horizon @xmath38 , which depends on the choice of the observer @xmath39 .",
    "the apparent spacelike nature of the normal to this surface is due to the use of isotropic coordinates .",
    "for later use we denote the corresponding hypersurface in our coordinate chart by @xmath40 .",
    "the metric ( [ desitter ] ) was first introduced in @xcite and is therefore known as ds resp .",
    "ads metric according to @xmath41 resp .",
    "its riemann tensor is given by @xmath43    the equations ( [ linear2 ] ) form a family of ten coupled generalised klein ",
    "gordon equations for which an algorithm providing closed solutions is not known .",
    "we point out that the high symmetry of ds resp .",
    "ads allows to derive exact solutions of equation ( [ einstein ] ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , if we impose the hilbert gauge condition @xmath44 , then the trace of equation ( [ linear2 ] ) turns into a simple klein  gordon equation for the trace of @xmath45 on ds resp .",
    "ads space , @xmath46 which may be solved exactly by using separation of variables @xcite .",
    "however , since we are interested in the physical consequences of the cosmological constant for all the components @xmath45 ( and not just for the trace ) in the regime of a metric perturbation , equation ( [ trace ] ) does not provide enough information .",
    "moreover , the perturbed solutions derived below are traceless , thus only the trivial solution of ( [ trace ] ) is relevant for our purposes .",
    "note that the contraction of the equations ( [ linear2 ] ) with the stationary killing field @xmath47 might lead to simpler equations .",
    "however , the resulting equations are still non  scalar , as this is suggested by the equations ( [ d1 ] ) below .",
    "thus the derivation of an analytic result , if possible , would be quite involved .",
    "although it would be useful to supplement the perturbative calculation below with analytic results in order to gain more confidence in the former , it seems that the effort for such a program would exceed the derivation of the perturbative results and definitely goes beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we therefore content ourselves with an expansion of ( [ linear2 ] ) with respect to @xmath0 up to linear order .",
    "we remark that such an expansion with respect to @xmath0 is consistent with the expansion with respect to @xmath16 . equations ( [ constant ] ) may also be expanded with respect to @xmath0 , and the coefficients of each order fulfill the equations subsequently .",
    "this point of view would correspond to a one  parameter perturbation of the minkowski metric @xmath48 of the form @xmath49 each coefficient @xmath50 could be written as @xmath51 where @xmath52 in other words , the @xmath53 contain the contributions from the background , whereas the @xmath54 describe the waveform . since @xmath0 carries the physical unit of @xmath55 , the @xmath56 order coefficients of the expansions above carry the physical unit @xmath57 .",
    "in particular the perturbation expansion with respect to @xmath0 is based on the assumption @xmath58 .",
    "we collect terms proportional to @xmath59 and denote them by @xmath60 . for @xmath58 equation ( [ desitter ] ) yields @xmath61 then the connection coefficients are of order @xmath62 and so are @xmath19 and @xmath63 by ( [ riemann ] ) , such that equation ( [ linear2 ] ) may be written as @xmath64 where @xmath65 , the comma denotes partial derivatives , the indices are uppered and lowered by @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is a linear hyperbolic differential operator of second order .",
    "we are thus led to consider the variable @xmath68 instead of @xmath45 .",
    "these variables differ if the trace @xmath18 does notvanish .",
    "however , the solutions which are considered in the following sections are trace  free , and therefore they satisfy @xmath69 .",
    "hereafter we will neglect the terms of order @xmath70 .",
    "then @xmath0 lends itself as expansion parameter for the following perturbation procedure .",
    "let @xmath71 denote the dalembert operator .",
    "we assume that the exact solution of the operator equation @xmath72 can be written as a power series in @xmath0 . up",
    "to linear order we then have @xmath73 where the coefficients @xmath74 carry the physical unit @xmath75 .",
    "thus a comparison to the case of a vanishing cosmological constant is achieved simply by considering only the zeroth order terms . plugging ( [ pertser ] ) into ( [ pertop ] ) yields by comparing coefficients order by order @xmath76 on the first equation in ( [ eqcoeff ] ) we impose the hilbert gauge condition @xmath77 and afterwards choose the transverse traceless gauge . thus the fundamental solutions are plane gravitational waves with the two linear polarization states `` @xmath1 '' and `` @xmath2''.the solutions of the second equation in ( [ eqcoeff ] ) are then determined by the expression @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the green s function of the dalembert operator and the star denotes the convolution .",
    "the domain of integration in ( [ conv ] ) is @xmath80 , which may be interpreted as lowest order approximation of @xmath81 . in order to avoid divergences we need to choose an appropriate decrease for the amplitude of @xmath82 for @xmath83 . for our case",
    "a power counting argument requires the asymptotic behaviour @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",
    "accordingly one requires the boundary conditions @xmath86 however , in the following sections we will consider only a small region of spacetime , so that the question of the behaviour for @xmath83 is not essential .",
    "we will , therefore , assume that the intersection of any spacelike hypersurface with the support of @xmath82 and thus the domain of integration in ( [ conv ] ) is compact .",
    "it is understood that in contrast to minkowski space the notion of planarity of a wavefront has to be modified for waves in curved spacetime . in the framework of exact solutions of the einstein s equations",
    "this is achieved by demanding that the spacetime admits a null vectorfield which is non - twisting and expansion - free .    however , in the perturbative approach we naturally assume that the wave front is a hyperplane up to lowest order . in a consistent perturbation expansion",
    "we are thus advised to assume that the fundamental solutions @xmath87 of the first equation in ( [ eqcoeff ] ) is a minkowski ",
    "plane wave .",
    "as mentioned above we restrict the support of @xmath87 . in doing",
    "so we need to avoid further destruction of the symmetries of plane waves .",
    "therefore we choose the domain of integration in ( [ conv ] ) to be spherically symmetric and indicate it by @xmath88 .",
    "we now choose the coordinate chart @xmath35 such that @xmath87 is a plane transverse traceless solution and the non  vanishing components are @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "these components are functions of the retarded time @xmath92 and describe thus a plane wave propagating in @xmath93direction .",
    "the non  vanishing components of @xmath94 are then given by @xmath95 we now restrict ourselves to the investigation of the contributions to the `` @xmath1''mode of @xmath96 .",
    "an analogous result may be derived for the `` @xmath2''mode .",
    "we have @xmath97 and @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is an arbitrary smooth function . equations ( [ d1 ] ) yield @xmath100 thus we are able to calculate the first order corrections by using formula ( [ conv ] ) , i. e. @xmath101 in particular , all components vanish except @xmath102   \\frac{d^3\\xi}{|\\vec{x}-\\vec{\\xi}| } \\nonumber \\\\   \\gamma^{(1)}_{22}(t,\\vec{x } ) & = & -\\gamma^{(1)}_{11}(t,\\vec{x } )",
    ". \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this result indicates that in contrast to the amplitude the polarization remains unchanged up to this order , thus preserving the quadrupole character of gravitational radiation .",
    "though an evaluation of the equation ( [ gamma1.1 ] ) in general can hardly be carried out analytically for arbitrary events @xmath103 , it still may be computed along the locus @xmath104 of the observer using spherical coordinates .",
    "we now introduce physical units .",
    "let @xmath105 , where @xmath106 denotes a frequency , and let @xmath107 denote the speed of light .",

    "a priori @xmath111 is a positive real number which measures the dimension of the support of @xmath87 in minkowski spacetime .",
    "a posteriori we gather from equation ( [ res ] ) that the perturbation expansion is reasonable if @xmath112 thus we formally obtain @xmath0dependent constraints on @xmath111 and @xmath106 .",
    "if we impose the the geometrical optics limit , @xmath113 , we have @xmath114 so that all the limites in ( [ lim1 ] ) follow from the first one . in section v we give more comments on the interpretation of @xmath111 .",
    "in particular we find that for our purposes we can assume @xmath115 . since @xmath106 is a constant parameter , the limits in ( [ lim1 ] ) are fullfilled . the condition @xmath116 yields then @xmath117 , which gives an upper bound on @xmath106 .    as an illustration of the above results we consider the example @xmath118 . due to the conditions in equation ( [ lim2 ] ) we can neglect the terms with coefficients proportional to @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , so that to leading order we get @xmath122 since @xmath117 , this can also be written as @xmath123 for a periodic @xmath87 , equation ( [ sin1 ] ) shows that the correction @xmath124 features a modified amplitude , whereas ( [ sin2 ] ) yields a modification of the frequency . in the following section",
    "we show that @xmath111 depends on the proper time of the observer . in general the frequency",
    "therefore changes with varying time .",
