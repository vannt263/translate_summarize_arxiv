    "the property of space - time has fundamental importance in understanding the law of nature .",
    "non - commutative ( nc ) quantum field theory provides an alternative to the ordinary quantum field theory which may shed some light on the detailed structure of space - time and have been studied in the past  @xcite .",
    "recently nc quantum field theory and its applications has also developed within string theories where it arises in low energy excitations of d - branes in the presence of certain @xmath9 background field and has received a lot of attention  @xcite .",
    "a simple way to modify the commutation relation for the ordinary space - time @xmath10 is defined , with the modified space - time coordinate @xmath11 , as    @xmath12 = i \\theta_{\\mu\\nu } = { i\\over \\lambda^2 } c_{\\mu\\nu}. \\label{eq : ncgeo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the above the parameter @xmath13 which has the dimension of energy signifies the scale where nc effects become relevant .",
    "@xmath14 is a real anti - symmetric matrix with elements of order one which commute with the space - time coordinate @xmath15 .",
    "phenomenologically the nc scale @xmath16 can take any value , the likely one being of the order of the planck scale @xmath17 .",
    "however , the recent studies in the area of large extra dimensions show that gravity becomes strong at the tev scale  @xcite , and also one might see some stringy effects at this scale .",
    "hence , it is justified if one takes the scale of @xmath13 to be of the order of tev scale .",
    "if this is the case , then whether nc geometry has anything to do with reality has to be tested experimentally . in this context the next generation @xmath18 linear collider(nlc )",
    "will be an ideal machine to probe such new physics effects .",
    "the @xmath18 version of nlc can be modified to give @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 mode of collider .",
    "some of the authors have already studied the nc effects at nlc  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study signatures of nc quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) at @xmath3 colliders .",
    "@xmath22 colliders can be very sensitive to certain new physics beyond the standard model  @xcite .",
    "we also find that @xmath21 colliders can provide interesting information about the scale @xmath13 of non - commutative geometry .",
    "two processes @xmath23 and @xmath24 will be studied in detail .",
    "these processes are particularly interesting in studying the non - commutative qed effects because at leading order they are purely qed processes , eliminating problems associated with difficulties to have a full gauge theory for @xmath25 .",
    "this is because that only u(n ) group can be gauged consistently with nc geometry  @xcite .",
    "the gauge group of the standard model has to be enlarged in the presence of nc geometry , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ncgeo ] ) .",
    "if weak interaction is involved , then there is problem to identify nc effects such as the process @xmath26 where exchange of z boson also contributes  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we study the @xmath27 process in nc qed with monochromatic photon beams and laser back - scattered photon beams for three values of center - of - mass energies @xmath28  tev , @xmath29  tev and @xmath30  tev  @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath5 cl lower bound which can be probed on the nc scale @xmath16 . in section iii we study the non - commutative scalar qed .",
    "we first derive the corresponding feynman rules and use them to obtain @xmath5 cl lower bound on @xmath13 from @xmath24 process . finally in section iv , we summarize our results .",
    "in this section we study the effects of nc qed in the @xmath31 process . nc qed with fermions has been studied extensively  @xcite .",
    "the feynman rules relevant are shown in fig .  1 and the feynman diagrams for @xmath31 are shown in fig .",
    "it is clear from the feynman rules and as well as from fig .",
    "2 that there are extra contributions to the ordinary qed .",
    "the ordinary qed vertex is modified to have a momentum dependent phase factor .",
    "apart from this there are completely new triple and quartic photon vertices making the nc qed like a non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "the origin of phase factors in the vertices can be traced back to the famous weyl - moyal correspondence  @xcite which we will state later .",
    "these new contributions to the existing vertices result in deviations from the ordinary qed predictions .",
    "we obtain the unpolarized differential cross section for @xmath32 process in the massless limit , as @xmath33,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the nc phase is @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the standard mandelstam variables . in the @xmath22 center - of - mass frame , @xmath38 and @xmath39",
    "can be further written in terms of @xmath40 and the angle @xmath41 between @xmath42 ( the z - direction ) and @xmath43 with @xmath44 , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 .",
    "the angle @xmath47 is the azimuthal angle .",
    "so , the nc effect in the @xmath27 process lies in the even function @xmath48 of @xmath49 and one can recover the ordinary qed result by taking the limit @xmath50 .",
    "the phase @xmath49 arises from the @xmath51-channel triple photon vertex diagram and also from the interference between the @xmath52-channel and @xmath53-channel diagrams .",
    "the cross sections are only sensitive to the nc parameter @xmath54 because the corrections only depend on @xmath55 which is equal to @xmath56 $ ] . because of this the cross section does not depend on the azimuthal angle @xmath47 and will be integrated over in the cross section from now on . in our later discussions",
    ", we will set @xmath57 and study the sensitivity to the nc scale @xmath13 .",
    "now we study the cross - section as a function of the nc scale @xmath13 . in obtaining the cross - section we sum over three leptonic ( @xmath58 ) generations .",
    "we also assume that the identification efficiencies for @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and @xmath61 to be @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "one should note that , due to the neglect of small lepton masses , there are singularities in the cross section when @xmath64 . to avoid these singularities",
    ", we demand that the rapidity @xmath65 of each lepton should be less than 1 .",
    "this choice of rapidity cut corresponds to an angular cut @xmath66 on each leptons . in fig .",
    "3 we plot the variation of this cross - section with @xmath13 for a monochromatic ( line with @xmath67 ) photon collider with energy @xmath68 tev . the adjacent solid line represents ordinary qed cross - section .",
    "it can be seen that the ordinary qed gets negative contribution from nc qed , and as the nc scale @xmath13 increases the nc qed result asymptotically approaches to the ordinary qed one .    to study the possible sensitivity of nlc to the nc scale @xmath13 we perform @xmath69 fit assuming that statistical errors are gaussian and that there are no systematic errors .",
    "@xmath69 is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the integrated luminosity , @xmath72 is the ordinary qed total cross - section and @xmath73 is the nc qed cross - section . by demanding @xmath74",
    ", we obtain the lower bound on the nc scale @xmath13 at @xmath5 cl .",
    "we denote this bound by @xmath75 .",
    "we take three machine energies @xmath76 , 1.0 and 1.5  tev , for illustrations . in the case of monochromatic photon collider , @xmath77 .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the scale @xmath75 as a function of @xmath71 from @xmath27 process . the solid lines in fig . 4 represent as a function of integrated luminosity @xmath71 for monochromatic photon beams .",
    "higher the @xmath78 larger the value of @xmath13 can be probed for a fixed integrated luminosity .",
    "this behavior can be understood from the nature of the nc correction term which goes as @xmath79 to this process .",
    "till now , we have discussed about the monochromatic photon beams .",
    "however , it is very difficult to obtain such a beam in practice .",
    "a realistic method to obtain high energy photon beam is to use the laser back - scattering technique on an electron or positron beam which produces abundant hard photons nearly along the same direction as the original electron or positron beam .",
    "the photon beam energy obtained this way is not monochromatic .",
    "the energy spectrum of the back - scattered photon is given by  @xcite @xmath80,\\nonumber\\\\ d(\\xi)&= & ( 1-{4\\over \\xi}-{8\\over \\xi^2})\\ln(1+\\xi ) + { 1\\over 2 } + { 8\\over \\xi } - { 1\\over 2(1+\\xi)^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the fraction of the energy of the incident @xmath81 beam .",
    "the parameter @xmath82 is determined to be @xmath83 by requiring that the back - scattered photon to have the largest possible energy , but does not interfere with the incident photon to create unwanted @xmath18 pair which sets @xmath84 .",
    "the cross section at such a @xmath3 collider with the @xmath4 collider center of mass frame energy @xmath85 is given by    @xmath86    to avoid the singularities at @xmath64 in @xmath87 , we make a cut on the rapidity of each lepton in the laboratory frame to be less than 1 and also a cut on the lepton energy such that the minimal values for @xmath88 to be @xmath89 . with this choice of cuts",
    "we show the variation of cross - section with @xmath13 in fig .",
    "3 . the dotted lines represent the nc qed cross - section , while the adjacent solid lines correspond to the ordinary qed results .",
    "compared to the monochromatic case , the cross - section decreases .",
    "naively one would expect the other way around because the cross - section decreases with energy .",
    "however , due to the cut on @xmath90 , certain portion of the scattering is also cut off which results in a smaller cross - section .    in fig .",
    "4 we present @xmath75 as a function of @xmath71 with dashed line . in this case , for a given @xmath85 and integrated luminosity , the @xmath5 cl lower bounds are weaker than that of monochromatic photons .",
    "for example , at @xmath91 tev and assuming the integrated luminosity @xmath92 the @xmath5 cl lower bound can be probed on @xmath13 is 1.2 tev .",
    "while in the monochromatic case , the corresponding bound is 1.6 tev .",
    "this is due to the fact that the available @xmath22 center - of - mass energy is not fixed but has an energy spectrum , which suppresses the nc effect .",
    "nc qed with scalars are less studied . in order to study @xmath94",
    ", we first construct the nc qed lagrangian with scalars in the following .",
    "the lagrangian in the ordinary quantum field theory relevant to @xmath95 is given by    @xmath96    where @xmath97 is the covariant derivative .",
    "when the above lagrangian is formulated with non - commutative coordinates , there are corrections .",
    "nc quantum field theory can be easily studied using the weyl - moyal correspondence replacing the product of two fields @xmath98 and @xmath99 with nc coordinates by  @xcite    @xmath100_{x = y},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 and @xmath101 are the ordinary coordinates , and @xmath102 , @xmath103 .    under an infinitesimal local gauge transformation @xmath104",
    ", the transformation law for @xmath105 is given by    @xmath106    writing the lagrangian in nc geometry , one obtains the tree level nc qed with scalars .",
    "we have    @xmath107    due to the nc properties , the ordering of the fields in the above equation is important and should not be misplaced . from this lagrangian",
    "one obtains the feynman rules given in fig .",
    "the structure shows some similar momentum dependent phase factor as in the nc qed with fermions .",
    "the feynman diagrams for @xmath108 are shown in fig .",
    "6 . in this case",
    "also we get an additional contribution to the normal qed process from an extra @xmath51-channel diagram , which has a non - abelian kind of structure .",
    "the amplitude for this process can be expressed as @xmath109.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in obtaining the cross section one should be careful about the non - abelian nature of the triple photon vertex since more than one gauge bosons are involved , that is one should treat the photon polarization sum with care to make sure that ward identities are satisfied and also to guarantee that the unphysical photon polarization states do not appear .",
    "we have worked with two methods with the same final results , one using explicit transverse photon polarization vectors , and another using  @xcite @xmath110.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 is any arbitrary @xmath112-vector and @xmath113 is the photon @xmath112-momentum .",
    "the same technique has been applied in the above charged lepton pair production study .",
    "the unpolarized differential cross section in the @xmath22 center - of - mass frame is given by @xmath114 \\nonumber\\\\     & \\times&\\bigg [ 1 - 4 \\frac{(m_h^2 - \\hat{t})(m_h^2 - \\hat{u})}{\\hat{s}^2 }       \\sin^2\\delta \\bigg].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the nc phase @xmath49 has been defined earlier , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 is velocity of the charged scalar . in this case also , in the limit @xmath118 , one obtains the pure qed result .",
    "again this process depends only on @xmath119 .",
    "the scalars are similar to charged higgses in multi - higgs models .",
    "however the decay products are not clear because the minimal standard model for electroweak interactions have to be extended with nc geometry .",
    "the charged scalar decay products may be modified .",
    "we will assume that the decay products of @xmath105 are similar to the charged higgs scalars in multi - higgs models and can be studied experimentally .",
    "one may also formulate nc qed with composite charged scalars , such as @xmath120 and @xmath121 which will be commented on later .",
    "the variation of unpolarised cross - section with @xmath13 for scalar mass @xmath122  gev at @xmath68 tev is also shown in fig . 3 for both monochromatic ( line with dark boxes ) and laser back - scattered ( dashed lines ) photon beams .",
    "the corresponding ordinary qed contributions , are also depicted by the solid lines . from this figure",
    "it can be seen that the ordinary qed gets negative contribution from nc qed like the @xmath123 process , and as the nc scale @xmath13 increases the nc qed contribution asymptotically approaches to the ordinary qed result .",
    "it is interesting to note that the cross - section in the back - scattered case is larger than that of monochromatic one , unlike the @xmath124 case discussed earlier .",
    "this is because that in this case no cut on the final product energy is applied , therefore all contributions are included .",
    "however , the monochromatic case still has larger deviation between the ordinary and non - commutative qed as can be seen in fig .",
    "now we discuss our results on @xmath75 for @xmath125 with monochromatic photon beams .",
    "we use two charged scalar masses , @xmath122  gev and @xmath126  gev , for illustrations .",
    "we display @xmath75 as a function of @xmath127 by the solid lines in the fig.7 ( a ) ( @xmath128  gev ) and fig.7 ( b)(@xmath129  gev ) .",
    "the numbers adjacent to each curve correspond to monochromatic photon collider .",
    "it is clear from these two figures that @xmath75 does depend on the scalar mass . the lighter the mass , the larger the scale one can explore for a given @xmath85 and integrated luminosity .",
    "for example , with @xmath130 tev , @xmath75 are 1.53 tev for @xmath122  gev and @xmath131  tev for @xmath129  gev , respectively . like the dilepton final state , here also , one can probe larger value of @xmath13 if one goes to higher energies .",
    "the results for the laser back - scattered photon beams are also shown in figs .",
    "7(a ) and 7(b ) by the dotted lines .",
    "in the case , there are no singularities at @xmath132",
    ". therefore we will let @xmath133 vary within the full allowed range , that is with @xmath134 .",
    "the integration lower limits for @xmath135 and @xmath136 are : @xmath137 and @xmath138 . the maximum value of @xmath135 and @xmath136 has been already mentioned in section ii . using eqn.(3 )",
    "we then obtain @xmath75 as a function of integrated luminosity @xmath71 which is shown by the dotted lines in fig .",
    "7 . as before , we study this case also for two values of scalar masses 100 gev and 200 gev .",
    "we see that the bounds which can be probed on the scale are in the range of 0.8 to 1.2 , 0.7 to 1.0 , and 0.4 to 0.6 tev for @xmath139 , 1.0 , and 0.5 tev , respectively .",
    "these bounds are slightly lower than that obtained in @xmath140 .",
    "if the theory is applicable to composite particles such as @xmath120 and @xmath121 , the nc scale that can be probed with @xmath141 fb@xmath142 is 1.5 tev ( 1.2 tev ) for monochromatic ( back - scattered ) photon beams for @xmath68 tev ( @xmath143 tev ) .",
    "of course it may be difficult to carry out such experiments with energies as high as what we are considering .    in the above discussions we have used tree level cross sections , especially our reference ordinary cross sections @xmath72 .",
    "there are loop contributions which may lead to the change of @xmath144 compared with when tree cross sections are used .",
    "however , the loop corrections are much smaller than the nc corrections for @xmath144 as large as 4 .",
    "the bounds we obtained are for nc corrections to good approximations .",
    "in summary , we have examined the feasibility of observing the experimental signature of non - commutative qed by studying dilepton and pair of charged scalars productions at high energy photon collider .",
    "we have parametrized the effect of nc qed by an anti - symmetric matrix @xmath14 and an overall nc scale @xmath16 .",
    "we found that in our processes only @xmath54 contributes . throughout our analysis",
    "we have set this parameter to 1 and studied the sensitivities of @xmath27 and @xmath24 processes on the nc scale @xmath13 .",
    "we first studied the sensitivity for monochromatic @xmath22 colliders .",
    "the variation of @xmath145 and @xmath146 with the nc scale @xmath13 at @xmath147 tev were obtained .",
    "we found that there are visible deviations between ordinary and nc qed predictions for small @xmath13 , but when @xmath13 becomes larger , @xmath148 asymptotically approaches @xmath72 .",
    "we also obtained @xmath149 cl lower limit which can be probed on @xmath13 from above mentioned two processes as functions of the integrated luminosity @xmath71 .",
    "it turned out that higher the available center - of - mass energy larger the nc scale @xmath13 one can probe .",
    "we found that with @xmath150 , and @xmath7  tev and integrated luminosity @xmath8 the nc scales can be probed up to 1.1 , 1.7 , and 2.6 tev , respectively .",
    "next we considered more realistic case , where , the photon beams are obtained by laser back - scattered from @xmath81 beams . in this case , the available @xmath151 center - of - mass energy has an spectrum with a maximum energy around @xmath152 of the @xmath78 .",
    "in general bounds on the scale that can be probed become lower . we have observed that for @xmath153 , and @xmath7  tev , with the integrated luminosity @xmath8 , the nc scales up to 0.7 , 1.2 , and 1.6 tev can be probed , respectively .",
