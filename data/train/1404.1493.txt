    "spin - isospin nuclear excitations @xcite , in particular the gamow - teller ( gt ) resonances , nowadays play a crucial role in several fields of physics . first in fundamental nuclear physics by providing information on the nuclear interaction , the equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter as well as the nuclear skin thickness @xcite .",
    "second , in astrophysics where they govern @xmath2-decay , electron and neutrino capture processes , hence stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis @xcite . finally , in particle physics in connection with the evaluation of the @xmath3 element and the unitarity of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa quark - mixing matrix @xcite , on the one hand , and with neutrino physics beyond the standard model ( neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite and neutrino oscillation @xcite ) , on the other hand .",
    "experimentally the spin - isospin nuclear excitations are studied via charge - exchange reactions , such as ( p , n ) , ( n , p ) , ( d,@xmath4he ) , ( @xmath5he , t ) or ( t,@xmath5he ) and @xmath2-decay measurements . in spite of the great efforts and interest , the whole nuclear chart is still not experimentally accessible , so that for the exotic nuclei , one can rely on theoretical models only . in this context one of the most popular models",
    "is the so - called proton - neutron quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( pnqrpa ) , first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . for a reliable prediction of the spin - isospin nuclear excitations , especially for experimentally unknown nuclei , two main features of the theoretical model",
    "are in order : the possibility to deal with deformed nuclei and the use of a unique effective nuclear force .",
    "the term unique has two different meanings here .",
    "first of all it implies that the interaction is the same for all nuclei , second that the nuclear interaction used to describe the ground and excited states is the same ; this latter property is usually referred as the self - consistency of the calculation . despite the relatively large number of pnqrpa calculations ( see ,",
    "e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein )",
    ", the number of models nowadays including both features remains small .",
    "furthermore , even in the limited number of self - consistent calculations performed either with the zero - range skyrme - type forces or in the relativistic mean field framework , there often remains a coupling constant , typically in the particle - particle channel , which is treated as a free parameter usually adjusted to @xmath2-decay half - lives or to the position of gt excitation energies . the possibility to take into account",
    "the nuclear deformation is also very important .",
    "the @xmath2-decay properties of exotic neutron - rich nuclei ( in particular those of interest to the r - process nucleosynthesis @xcite ) as well as the nuclear matrix elements for the double @xmath2-decay have been shown to depend significantly on the deformation parameter @xcite .",
    "furthermore , deformed nuclei present a strong fragmentation in the response functions and different nuclear shapes can be experimentally distinguished .    here , we present a fully self - consistent axially - symmetric - deformed pnqrpa calculation without any additional parameters beyond those characterizing the effective nuclear force , namely the finite - range gogny force within its two parametrizations , d1 m @xcite and d1s @xcite .",
    "this work represents a transposition to the charge - exchange sector of the fully consistent axially - symmetric - deformed qrpa calculations with the gogny force , first presented in ref .",

    "our approach is based on the pnqrpa on top of axially - symmetric - deformed hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) calculations .",
    "the hfb equations are solved in a finite harmonic oscillator basis . as a consequence",
    ", the positive energy continuum is discretized .",
    "all hfb quasiparticle states are used to generate the two - quasiparticle ( 2-qp ) excitations .",
    "this means that in principle our calculation can be performed without a cut in energy or in occupation probabilities .",
    "according to the symmetries imposed in the present axially - symmetric - deformed hfb calculations in even - even nuclei , the projection @xmath6 of the angular momentum @xmath7 on the symmetry axis and the parity @xmath8 are good quantum numbers .",
    "consequently , pnqrpa calculations can be performed separately in each @xmath9 block . in this context , phonons are characterized by the excitation operator @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the quasi - particle operators , related to the particle creation ( @xmath13 ) and annihilation ( @xmath14 ) operators through the @xmath15 and @xmath16 bogoliubov transformation matrices ; for example , @xmath17 here and in the following , repeated indices are implicitly summed over ; @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 denote proton and neutron quasiparticle and harmonic oscillator states , respectively . in the well - known qrpa matrix equation @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the energies of the pnqrpa excited states of the parent nucleus , the matrices @xmath24 and @xmath25 take , in the case of charge - exchange excitations , the following form : @xmath26 and @xmath27 as already emphasized , we use the same nucleon - nucleon effective gogny force ( more exactly the d1 m or d1s parametrizations ) , both for the hfb and qrpa calculations in all particle - hole ( ph ) , particle - particle ( pp ) , and hole - hole ( hh ) channels .",
    "this procedure is important to avoid numerical and physical inconsistencies . to solve the qrpa matrix equation we use the same numerical procedure recently applied to study the giant resonances of the heavy deformed @xmath28u @xcite .",
    "it is based on a massive parallel master - slave algorithm . for a single solution of eq .",
    "( [ equaref ] ) the qrpa provides the set of amplitudes @xmath29 and @xmath30 describing the wave function of the excited state @xmath31 in terms of the 2-qp excitations .",
    "once the pnqrpa matrix equation is solved we can calculate the response to the fermi , or isospin lowering , operator @xmath32 obtaining the iar , the simplest charge - exchange transition in which a neutron is changed into a proton without any other variation of the quantum numbers . in an axially - symmetric - deformed nuclear system",
    ", the response function of a given @xmath33 contains different @xmath34 components . in",

    "[ fig_zr_sn_pb ] , their fermi and gt strength distributions calculated with d1 m and d1s interactions are compared to the experimental data @xcite .",
    "even if , in principle , our calculation can be performed without a cut in energy , in practice we consider here 2-qp states up to an energy of 70 mev which turns out to be large enough to totally exhaust the fermi and ikeda sum rules .",
    "the results are expressed as a function of the excitation energy @xmath46 referred to the ground state of the daughter nucleus . in our model , it is obtained by subtracting a reference energy @xmath47 from the excitation energy @xmath23 of the parent nucleus calculated in the pnqrpa , i.e. , @xmath48 .",
    "the reference energy corresponds to the lowest 2-qp excitation associated with the ground state of the odd - odd daughter nucleus in which the quantum numbers of the single quasi - proton and neutron states are obtained from the self - consistent hfb calculation of the odd - odd system .",
    "we remind that for even - even nuclei , the hfb ground state @xmath49 is assumed to be an independent quasi - particle state @xmath50 ( quasi - particle vacuum ) .",
    "however , for an odd - odd system , the hfb equations involve a ground state @xmath51 described as a 2-qp ( proton neutron ) excitation on top of a qp vacuum @xmath52 : @xmath53 with @xmath54 ; @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) running over proton ( neutron ) qp states . in practice",
    ", we perform several `` blocked '' hfb calculations ( obtained through the minimization of the total binding energy with respect to the ground state @xmath51 ) , each of them corresponding to a specific choice of the proton and neutron qp quantum numbers . the couple ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) that gives the lowest binding energy among the different hfb calculations is selected , and the corresponding quantum numbers of the odd - odd hfb ground - state ( spin and parity ) deduced .",
    "such a procedure allows us to determine consistently the quantum characteristics of the reference 2-qp excitation in the parent nucleus . in most cases , the reference energy @xmath47 is equal to the lowest energy of the 2-qp excitation of ph type .",
    "both interactions give quite similar results for the position of the main peak .",
    "a one - to - one correspondence between the predicted main peaks is found .",
    "the energy position of the experimental iar is quite well reproduced .",
    "the iar is experimentally known to be characterized by a single narrow state .",
    "this is the case not only of the @xmath43pb but also for the open shell @xmath42sn .",
    "the result for @xmath42sn reflects the right contribution of the pp channel to the proton - neutron residual interaction , without which the response function will be fragmented @xcite .",
    "the situation is slightly different for @xmath45zr where two states very close to each other , probably experimentally undistinguishable , appear .",
    "note that our hfb calculations only includes the direct contribution of the coulomb interaction , while the coulomb exchange part is not taken into account .",
    "this approximation overestimates the proton pairing in general @xcite , and in @xmath45zr in particular . for this nucleus",
    "we repeated the calculation of the iar starting from hfb calculations including direct and exchange coulomb fields and obtained a disappearance of the fragmentation .",
    "however , since no gogny interaction has yet been derived including the coulomb contribution to the pairing field , we will restrict ourselves here to the standard hfb calculations as a starting point for our pnqrpa calculation .",
    "we have also checked that switching - off the coulomb interactions in hfb calculations brings the iar down to zero energy .    turning to the gt ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_zr_sn_pb ] ) , the d1 m interaction is seen to give rise to a strength located at lower energies with respect to the one found with d1s . for the nuclei analyzed here , this energy shift rarely exceeds 0.5 mev . in this context , it should be recalled that the d1 m and d1s interactions are characterized by rather different parameters , leading to different nuclear matter properties and landau parameters .",
    "the gt energy is known to be sensitive to the single - particle spectrum as well as to the landau parameter , in particular @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "more specifically , there is a general tendency for the gt energy to increase with increasing spin - orbit strength parameters @xmath58 and with increasing values of @xmath57 , though this latter tendency may be less clear ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) . for the interactions considered here , @xmath58=115.4",
    "mev @xmath59 for d1 m and 130.0 mev @xmath59 for d1s while @xmath60 for d1 m and 0.61 for d1s .",
    "even if the total effect on the energy position of the gt peak is a delicate balance between the effects related to the single - particle spectrum ( particularly sensitive to the spin - orbit strength ) , the residual interaction ( strictly related to the landau parameter @xmath57 ) as well as the @xmath47 shift , the systematic ( small ) d1s overestimate of the gt energy with respect to d1 m seems to suggest that the @xmath58 parameter plays the major role .",
    "as far as the comparison with experimental data is concerned , the agreement is seen to be rather satisfactory ( fig . [ fig_zr_sn_pb ] ) . a small but systematic overestimate of the gt peak is found .",
    "particle - vibration coupling @xcite as well as tensor interaction contribution @xcite , both absent in our approach , have been shown to lead to a small shift of the giant gt resonance towards lower energies .",
    "our pnqrpa calculation provide a discrete strength distribution . to derive a smooth continuous strength function",
    ", the pnqrpa gt strength can be folded with a lorentz function , as classically done .",
    "to do so , the spreading width @xmath61 is parametrized to reproduce the experimental gt widths found experimentally in sn isotopes with @xmath62 @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_gamma_exp_sn ] .",

    "as expected , the deformation tends to increase the fragmentation of the response .",
    "calculations with different deformations produce peaks that are displaced .",
    "this is true not only for the giant resonance region but also for the low energy states .",

    "[ fig_ge76 ] to compare to our results at different @xmath64 .",

    "to give an idea of the global predictions of our model , we compare in fig.[fig_t12exp ] for even - even nuclei the pnqrpa ( obtained with the d1 m interaction ) @xmath0-decay half - lives with the experimental data @xcite .",

    "they turn to be quite homogeneous with respect to @xmath24 and more particularly @xmath64 .",
    "larger deviations are found for nuclei close to the valley of @xmath2-stability ( fig.[fig_t12exp ] , right panel ) , i.e for low-@xmath75 values , as found in all models .",
    "note , however , that in fig.[fig_t12exp ] where only nuclei with experimental data are concerned , large @xmath75-values essentially correspond to light nuclei for which mean - field models may be less adequate to estimate the ground - state deformation , mixing of configuration being found beyond the mean - field approximation .",
    "globally , predictions tend to overestimate the experimental half - lives , but deviations rarely exceed one order of magnitude .",
    "note that the half - life overestimation found here is less important that the effect of neglecting pn pairing in relativistic qrpa calculation @xcite .",

    "@xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig_t12_n82 ] for the exotic neutron - rich nuclei along the @xmath76 and 184 isotones .",

    "[ fig_t12_n82 ] for the df3+cqrpa calculation to illustrate the impact of the ff contributions , as predicted by @xcite .",
    "clearly , such a contribution need to be included for the @xmath80 nuclei and some of the @xmath81 nuclei .",
    "our results give rise to decay half - lives systematically larger than the df3+cqrpa approach .",
    "these deviations can originate from different gt strength but also different estimates for the @xmath75-values or reference energies @xmath47 .",

    "[ fig_t12_n82 ] the shell model predictions @xcite for some of the @xmath1 nuclei that are in relatively close agreement with the df3+cqrpa calculations and lower than ours .",
    "such different predictions could have an impact on the production of the heavy nuclei by the r - process nucleosynthesis , but such an analysis is postponed to a future study .",
    "we present here for the first time a fully self - consistent axially - symmetric - deformed pnqrpa calculation based on the finite - range gogny force .",
    "we applied our model to the analysis of charge - exchange modes paying a special attention to the gt resonances .",
    "the crucial role of deformation , automatically included in our approach , was analyzed .",
    "the agreement with experiment is satisfactory both for the strength functions and the @xmath0-decay half - lives .",
    "our extrapolation of the @xmath2-decay half - lives to the neutron - rich @xmath1 , 126 and 184 isotones of astrophysical interest are found to give rise to larger values with respect to the continuum qrpa calculation of @xcite .",
    "these encouraging results open the way to further studies in several sectors .",
    "in particular , it will become possible to include the study of iar and gt resonances in the procedure of construction and validation of new gogny - type forces . in connection with astrophysics",
    "the next step of our work will include forbidden transitions and deal with large - scale calculations of @xmath2-decay half - lives and electron neutrino capture rates for both even and odd numbers of nucleons to analyze their impact on the r - process nucleosynthesis . finally ,",
    "from a particle physics point of view , the evaluation within our model , among others , of the low - energy neutrino - nucleus cross section and the double-@xmath2 decay nuclear matrix elements could shed light on the systematics of nuclear origin to be taken into account in these rare processes .",

    "<S> axially symmetric deformations are consistently taken into account , both in the description of the ground states and spin - isospin excitations . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the isobaric analog and gamow - teller resonances . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the predicted strength distributions to the existing experimental data is presented and the role of nuclear deformation analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> the gamow - teller strength is used to estimate the @xmath0-decay half - life of nuclei for which experimental data exist . a satisfactory agreement with experimental half - lives </S>",
    "<S> is found and justifies the additional study of the exotic neutron - rich @xmath1 , 126 and 184 isotonic chains of relevance for the r - process nucleosynthesis . </S>"
