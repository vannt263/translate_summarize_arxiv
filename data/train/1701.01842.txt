    "efficient control of magnetic structures by electric fields might revolutionize the field of magnetic memory devices . compared to the existing technology that switches magnetic states using electric currents ( via created magnetic fields or spin - transfer torques ) and thus is subject to joule heating @xcite , the replacement of current with an electric field promises to reduce energy dissipation by the factor of 100 [ ] .",
    "several mechanisms of the electric - field manipulation of magnetism were proposed such as : electric - field changing the carriers concentration , which mediate magnetic interactions in magnetic semiconductors ; changing the magnetic anisotropy in insulator / magnetic metal heterostructures ; using magnetoelectric coupling in multiferroic materials @xcite . in the present work",
    "we will focus on the latter mechanism .",
    "magnetoelectric effect was first discovered `` with the point of the pen '' by dzyaloshinskii @xcite and then this prediction was experimentally observed by astrov in @xmath2 [ ] .",
    "then , after a fast development in 60s-70s , interest to such materials gradually faded away , because of the weakness of the observed effect .",
    "but since the experimental successes of 2000-s  discovery of many multiferroics ( materials in which two or more ferroic orders , such as ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity , are present @xcite ) and `` revival '' of the field , magnetoelectric materials are still in the focus of both experimental and theoretical research",
    ". for recent reviews on multiferroics see @xcite .",
    "according to the classification of khomskii @xcite , there are two types of multiferroics .",
    "type i consists of multiferroics , where both ferromagnetic and ferroelectric orders coexist , being almost not coupled to each other . while in type - ii multiferroics",
    "the two orders are coupled and usually a magnetic order creates an electric one .",
    "this feature can be used backwards : applying an electric field and inducing polarization , magnetic patterns can be also created and manipulated . while this type - ii feature was originally coined to multiferroics , it becomes more spread that this coupling between magnetization and electric polarization can appear in any magnetic insulator , where it is allowed by symmetry @xcite . in 2008 dzyaloshinskii theoretically predicted the possibility of creation and manipulation of domain walls by electric fields in conventional and weak ferromagnets @xcite and the movement of magnetic domain walls under the action of electric field was directly observed @xcite .",
    "the use of domain walls and other topological defects in multiferroics @xcite for magnetic storage is particularly appealing since it provides a mechanism of very dense packing of information , while topological nature protects information from loss under the influence of external perturbations such as heating or mechanical action @xcite . among the bright examples of such topological defects are skyrmion lattices @xcite , as well as individual skyrmions observed in magnetoelectric materials @xcite , magnetic vortices @xcite and their discrete analogues @xcite , domain walls @xcite . usually such defects and textures are observed in thin - film magnetoelectric materials @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we consider theoretically a phenomenological model developed by mostovoy @xcite for a type - ii multiferroics and apply it to a thin - film material with easy plane symmetry .",
    "we show both analytically and numerically that in this case a strong enough locally - concentrated electric field may cause formation of a `` magnetic atom '' that consists of vortex `` nucleus '' surrounded by antivortex `` shells '' .",
    "this idea allows us to propose an experimental realization for 2d coulomb plasma in a trap and make predictions about its normal modes .",
    "the topic of finite coulomb plasma clusters , and particularly of their normal modes , draws great attention in different areas of physics ( see [ , ] and references therein )",
    ". however , usually particles in 2d plasma clusters interact between themselves via screened or unscreened 3d coulomb @xmath3 potential . on the contrary , systems that we consider in this work",
    "provide a unique possibility of creation of plasma with constituents interacting via 2d coulomb @xmath4 potential .",
    "also presented here research has some reminiscence with quantum electrodynamics .",
    "it was proposed that space- or time- dependent electric fields can generate electron - positron pairs from vacuum or fill empty electronic shells in an atom , producing a positron @xcite .",
    "the idea was first theoretically proposed by sauter [ ] and schwinger [ ] and attracts considerable interest in the present days ( see , for example , [ ] ) .",
    "but the experimental observation is still lacking : such strong electric fields can not be obtained in laboratory conditions yet ; now steps are being done in this direction : extreme light infrastructure project @xcite , which will presumably allow to reach schwinger limit @xcite , is currently under construction .",
    "another example lies in the physics of heavy atoms . for atomic numbers @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the fine structure constant ) electric field becomes so strong that the nucleus can tear electrons out of vacuum and fill lower electron levels while emitting positrons @xcite .",
    "this effect was not yet observed since such heavy atoms are very unstable .",
    "however , recently a condensed - matter version of the artificial atom - like structures was realized in graphene @xcite .",
    "the present paper proposes an experimental setup for observation of analogous effects in another part of the realm of condensed matter systems , in multiferroics : we propose that vortex - antivortex pairs can be created from the ground state of a type - ii multiferroic thin film by applying a strong non - uniform electric field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we introduce our basic phenomenological model of quasi - two - dimensional type - ii multiferroic - like material . in sec.iii",
    "we explore the consequences of applying strong non - uniform electric field created by a tip of cantilever and find `` the first critical electric field '' , when the first vortex - antivortex pair is created . in sec.iv",
    "we present our analytical results on the number of induced vortices and vortex density distribution in the continuous model . in sec.v we deal explicitly with the effects of discreteness of vortex distribution and estimate the principal part of temperature dependence of polarizability of artificial `` magnetic atom '' .",
    "sec.vi presents our numerical results , which confirm theoretical calculations in sec .",
    "iv and v. sec.vii contains our conclusions and some ideas of experimental observation of the described effects .",
    "in order to describe a 2d material with coupled magnetic and electric subsystems we use the following phenomenological model .",
    "we write the total free energy density as a sum of parts arising from electric polarization , magnetization , and magnetoelectric coupling respectively : @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the energy of electric polarization @xcite , @xmath9 is the electric susceptibility in the absence of magnetization ; we assume that there is no spontaneous polarization in the absence of magnetization , thus the @xmath10 term is absent in the free energy ( [ w_e ] ) .",
    "we write the magnetic part of the free energy as @xmath11\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is magnetic non - uniformity energy @xcite ; contribution @xmath12 that keeps @xmath13 is implied .",
    "since we are modeling thin - film material , we assume that the film thickness @xmath14 is much less than the exchange length and neglect the variations of @xmath15 in the transverse to the film direction .",
    "we also note that the same kind of analysis can be done also for an antiferromagnetic model , which also possesses the vortex excitations @xcite .",
    "the most interesting energy part is the coupling energy @xcite , which characterizes type - ii multiferroics @xmath16 this lifshits - type term was introduced based on symmetry grounds ; it can be present if spatial inversion symmetry is broken .",
    "one of the possible underlying microscopic mechanisms is based on the inverse dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction @xcite .    combining three contributions ( [ w_e ] ) , ( [ w_m ] ) , ( [ w_me ] ) we write the total free energy density of the magnetoelectric material as @xmath17.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we assume that @xmath15 is a primary order parameter , which can induce @xmath18 . so that we can find polarization by minimizing ( [ energy - density ] ) with respect to @xmath19 @xmath20 because of the thin film geometry of the sample , magnetization tends to be parallel to the film plane , otherwise the magnetic energy of the demagnetizing field would greatly increase ; also material can possess additional easy - plane type of symmetry .",
    "therefore we restrict the magnetization to lie in the plane @xmath21 using the angle variable @xmath22 the polarization can be written as @xmath23 substituting ( [ m ] ) and ( [ polarization ] ) to ( [ energy - density ] ) , we see that electric , magnetic , and magnetoelectric parts of energy combine to @xmath24 assume , for a moment , that @xmath25 . in this case expression for energy",
    "@xmath26 is similar to one of the xy model @xmath27 with an effective spin - wave stiffness @xmath28 where @xmath14 is the film thickness .",
    "hence , in the absence of the electric field , the magnetoelectric coupling just renormalizes the spin - stiffness of the xy model . for typical values of parameters",
    "@xcite ( @xmath29 erg / cm , @xmath30 ( erg / cm)@xmath31 , @xmath32 ) : @xmath33 is greater than @xmath34 by @xmath35 orders of magnitude ; therefore , @xmath36 remains almost unchanged by magnetoelectric interaction : @xmath37 .    despite this , some interesting features appear .",
    "it is well known that in the xy and related models the magnetic vortices play the crucial role @xcite .",
    "vortex placed at the origin has the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the winding number of the vortex , @xmath40 is an arbitrary angle .",
    "it turns out that magnetoelectric coupling affects vortices . from ( [ polarization ] )",
    "it follows that polarization of magnetic vortex is @xmath41 .",
    "this leads to the fact that a magnetic vortex acquires an electric charge , which is proportional to the winding number of the vortex@xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a vortex charge per unit film thickness .",
    "consider now what happens in non - zero electric field .",
    "the @xmath22-dependent part of energy can be rewritten with the accuracy @xmath44 in the coupling constant as @xmath45 from this we see that the ground state in the electric field is reached when @xmath46 .    for example , a weak constant in - plane electric field modifies the ground state configuration into a cycloidal magnetic structure with a period @xmath47 and the wave - vector perpendicular to the electric field @xcite . at @xmath48",
    "this magnetic structure creates polarization @xmath49 and gives contribution to electric susceptibility : @xmath50 .",
    "we also see , that @xmath51 as @xmath52 , and hence , finite size magnetic orientational defects are not influenced by infinitesimal electric field .    when the electric field is not constant , nor weak ,",
    "it is convenient to write it with the use of the electric field potential @xmath53 , so the coupling term ( [ w_me ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath54 excluding singular points from the integration domain and making cuts in order that it was simply connected , we can integrate by parts and get : @xmath55 where the boundary integral over the edge of the sample @xmath56 contains a normal to it , @xmath57 . since the integration domain is simply connected and does not contain singularities , the second integral in ( [ wme2 ] ) vanishes .",
    "the first integral can be transformed using the fact that @xmath58 , so @xmath59 .",
    "integration contour includes not only outer boundary of the sample , but also all singular points of @xmath60 .",
    "since integration around the singularities is clockwise , we take out @xmath61 and make it counterclockwise ; @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the winding number ( vorticity ) of @xmath64-th singular point .",
    "integrals along cuts give @xmath65 , since @xmath66 is single - valued ( though @xmath22 itself is not ) . therefore , we obtain @xmath67 the first term in ( [ wme3 ] ) has a form @xmath68 .",
    "this means , that similarly to the case of zero electric field ( [ qe ] ) , in non - zero electric field vortices still have an electric charge proportional to  winding number of the vortex @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , vortices carry positive charge @xmath70 and antivortices carry negative charge @xmath71 .",
    "however , from ( [ wme3 ] ) we see that when the external electric field is applied , boundary effects become important .",
    "consider a single vortex , which has electric charge ( [ qe ] ) due to the magnetoelectric interaction .",
    "from the total electroneutrality it follows that the boundary of the sample also becomes charged ; it acquires charge of the same magnitude but the opposite sign compared to the vortex . in a longitudinal external field ,",
    "the boundary charge effectively shields the charge of the vortex , and the value of screening depends on the geometry of the sample . in this work we assume for simplicity that our sample is a disk with radius @xmath72 .",
    "for such a disk screening of longitudinal constant electric field reduces the effective charge of vortices exactly twice @xcite ( see appendix a for further details ) . for axially symmetric electric fields with potential @xmath73 the integral in ( [ wme3 ] )",
    "gives just @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "so for magnetically neutral systems ( when @xmath76 ) the edge charge is zero and ( [ wme3 ] ) transforms to @xmath77 coupling energy ( [ wme3 ] ) is additive both in @xmath22 and in @xmath78 .",
    "additivity in @xmath22 tells us that magnetoelectric coupling does not influence the vortex - vortex magnetic interaction , which comes only from non - additive term @xmath79 in ( [ energy1 ] ) .",
    "therefore vortices interact as in xy model via @xmath80 coulomb potential @xcite @xmath81 , where @xmath82 , see ( [ rho ] ) ; @xmath83 is the short - distance cut - off of order of the lattice spacing ; here and further we put for simplicity vorticities to be @xmath84 , since vortices with higher winding numbers are unstable towards decomposition to these elementary ones .",
    "the magnetic energy of a magnetically neutral system of @xmath85 vortices and @xmath85 antivortices can be written as@xcite : @xmath86 here @xmath87 is the distance between @xmath64-th and @xmath88-th vortex cores .    for a sample with the number @xmath89 of vortices not equal to the number @xmath90 of antivortices formula ( [ wm ] ) can be generalized to @xmath91    we would like to emphasize that there is also purely electrostatic coulomb interaction between the vortex cores , but it gives contribution @xmath92 , which is negligibly small compared to the interaction @xmath93 with the external electric field .",
    "therefore , in what follows we adopt an approximation , in which a system of vortices and antivortices interact with each other only via the magnetic subsystem , and in addition , they interact with the external electric fields due to the magnetoelectric coupling .",
    "in this section we explore the basic idea of the paper , that a strong non - uniform electric field can break the `` magnetic vacuum '' of magnetoelectric material via creation of vortex - antivortex pairs .       and thickness @xmath14 .",
    "above its center at the height @xmath94 the tip of the cantilever with a negative charge @xmath95 is placed . ]",
    "fig.[fig_geometry ] shows typical experimental setup that we keep in mind ( which was proposed in refs .",
    "[ ] , [ ] ) .",
    "an electric field is produced by a tip of a cantilever with a fixed point charge @xmath96 .",
    "because of the magnetoelectric interaction , strong enough electric field makes possible creation of magnetic vortices . in this section",
    "we work in the limit of low temperatures , where there is no thermally activated vortex - antivortex ( va ) pairs ( for @xmath97 their number is exponentially small ) .",
    "electric potential produced by the tip of the cantilever with charge @xmath95 is @xmath98 where @xmath94 is the distance from the tip to the sample , @xmath99 is the polar radius of the point of observation .",
    "we assume that the sample is thin : its thickness @xmath100 , so we neglect the variation of the electric field in the transverse to the film direction inside the film .      in this subsection",
    "we find critical value of electric field that creates the first vortex - antivortex pair at @xmath48 in a sample of big enough size to accommodate the pair as a whole ( `` big sample '' ) .",
    "let the electric field produce one va - pair with vortex situated at the center of the disk and antivortex placed at the distance @xmath99 from its center ( in the considered case of big samples @xmath101 ) .",
    "energy of the pair as a function of @xmath99 consists of the magnetic energy ( [ wm ] ) of va - interaction and magnetoelectric part ( [ wme4 ] ) : @xmath102    find @xmath99 that minimizes this energy : @xmath103 instead of @xmath104 , @xmath99 , and @xmath94 it is convenient to introduce dimensionless variables @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath14 : @xmath107 then , from the condition @xmath108 we get the following cubic equation @xmath109 this equation always has a negative root ( fig.[fig_cubic ] ) .",
    "when parameter @xmath105 increases from @xmath65 to some critical value @xmath110 the equation also acquires a positive multiple root .",
    "this happens when the discriminant of the cubic equation is equal to @xmath65 , from which we find @xmath111 and @xmath112 , which means that for this critical value of charge the most favourable distance for va - pair is @xmath113 . for @xmath114",

    "then , the local minimum state with one va pair becomes the global one when its energy becomes negative .",
    "this condition @xmath121 is fulfilled when : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the greatest root of ( [ cubic ] ) that corresponds to the local minimum of energy ; @xmath124 . since the left hand side of ( [ energy_inequality ] ) is positive ,",
    "the above inequality can be fulfilled only if the right hand side is also positive , therefore , at least @xmath125 . for such big @xmath105 equation ( [ cubic ] )",
    "always has 2 positive roots , with the greater one @xmath126 ( and the lesser one @xmath127 corresponding to the local maximum of energy ) .",
    "returning back to the original variables we find the optimal distance between the vortex and the antivortex that minimizes the energy @xmath128 : @xmath129 substituting @xmath130 in ( [ energy_inequality ] ) with the accuracy @xmath131 we get @xmath132 an approximate solution of the equation @xmath133 is @xmath134 . from this",
    "we deduce the critical charge @xmath135 , above which the first va - pair forms @xmath136    for @xmath137 vortex - antivortex solution corresponds not only to a local but also to the global minimum of energy .",
    "we also define the critical voltage of the tip as voltage produced at the nearest to the tip point of the sample : @xmath138 for the same typical values of parameters as we used in sec.[sec_model ] , we get @xmath139 , so @xmath140 .",
    "higher values of tip voltages can lead to systems with several vortex - antivortex pairs .      above we considered the case of a big sample , when va - pair lies far from its boundary .",
    "the opposite case of small samples is also possible and some estimates were made in ref .",
    "if @xmath141 becomes greater than @xmath72 ( or @xmath142 ) , the antivortex leaves the sample , and because the positively electrically charged vortex remains in its center , the boundary of the sample acquires a negative charge ( see appendix a for details ) .",

    "the single vortex is created when energy @xmath128 becomes negative , i.e. when voltage @xmath145 is applied .",
    "in this section we construct an analytical theory in the continuous approximation for vortex distribution .",
    "it proves that even such a crude approximation captures many effects and allows us to find the vortex distribution profile , the number of vortices for given @xmath104 , and the ground state energy of the system .",
    "these results are numerically verified in sec.[sec_numerical ] .",
    "the number of vortices in the system is not fixed ( as if it were an external parameter ) , but rather is determined by the condition of the energy minimum . in this section",

    "in this section we find the polarizability of big samples with zero total magnetic vorticity , for which even the most distant from the tip antivortices do not feel the boundaries of the sample .",
    "as explained below , continuous approach can not be applied to polarizability calculation and we have to deal explicitly with the effects of discreteness of vortex distribution over the sample .",

    "since our sample is electrically neutral , its edge acquires negative charge of the same magnitude , which should also be taken into account ( see fig.[disk ] ) .",
    "this edge charge effectively shields the vortex charge , modifying its energy .",
    "let our sample be disk with radius @xmath72 , which contains a single vortex with vorticity @xmath313 , placed at the distance @xmath314 from the center of the disk",
    ". chose a coordinate system as shown in fig.[coord ] ; electric field @xmath315 .    from ( [ polarization ] )",
    "polarization of single vortex configuration ( [ vortex ] ) is @xmath316 since we calculate the linear response , @xmath317 term was omitted from ( [ polarization ] ) .",
    "then the electric energy of magnetic vortex configuration is @xmath318 @xmath319 since @xmath320 is an even function of @xmath321 , then the odd term @xmath322 vanishes .",
    "thus , @xmath323    using ( [ qe ] ) we obtain @xmath324 or for general displacement of vortex core @xmath325 @xmath326    we see that for the circular sample geometry this energy is exactly a half of the vortex core energy of charged particle in the in - plane electric field .",
    "this effective shielding comes from the boundary charge and its exact value depends on the geometry of the sample .",
    "we also note that since polarization ( [ p - app ] ) is linear in phase angle @xmath22 , the same result ( [ energy - app ] ) holds for vortex - antivortex configuration , with @xmath327 denoting a vector that connects cores of the antivortex and the vortex .",
    "in this appendix we find the polarizability that comes from thermally activated dipole pairs at @xmath328 . since the chemical potential of a pair is quite big , the concentration of pairs is low and we can employ the approximation of non - interacting pairs .",
    "therefore we can find polarizability of one pair , then multiply it by the number of pairs and we will get polarizability of the va pairs subsystem .    first , find the polarizability of one va dipole pair .",
    "energy of a dipole pair is the sum of magnetic interaction energy of the vortex and antivortex ( [ wm ] ) and the magnetoelectric energy ( [ energy - app ] ) , obtained in the appendix a. @xmath329 here @xmath330 is the vector connecting the antivortex core to the vortex core ; the electric field is chosen to be parallel to the @xmath106-axis .",
    "the partition function of such a dipole : @xmath331 where @xmath332 is the area of the system , which comes from integration over the dipole center of mass . for zero electric field",
    "we get @xmath333    average dipole moment of a pair : @xmath334 formally , this integral diverges at large @xmath99 .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that we are calculating linear response ( i.e. , we take the limit @xmath52 ) , so that @xmath99-divergence is cut off at the radius of the sample @xmath335 .",
    "therefore , if we first take derivative of @xmath336 with respect to @xmath194 and then put @xmath337 , then we obtain the correct result .",
    "hence , polarizability of one pair is @xmath338 integrating which we obtain @xmath339    second , estimate the concentration of va pairs . since a weak field",
    "does not affect their concentration , we make the estimation for @xmath340 .",
    "moreover , due to the fact that the chemical potential of a pair is quite big with respect to @xmath261 : ( @xmath341 , @xmath342 , see ref . [ ] ) , concentration of va pairs is always small .",
    "calculate the grand partition function of non - interacting dipole system : @xmath343    then , the number of thermally activated va pairs @xmath344 finally , combining ( [ alpha_1 ] ) and ( [ npairs ] ) we find the polarizability of the sample that comes from all dipole pairs @xmath345 from here we can deduce the electric susceptibility @xmath346 and we see that it is consistent with kosterlitz - thouless s susceptibility @xcite with the difference that now we have the electric charge @xmath347 instead of @xmath348 in the numerator .",
    "this is natural since the response to the electric field depends on the value of electric charge @xmath70 whereas screening comes from the interaction of `` magnetic '' charges @xmath348 .",
    "we see that at low temperatures @xmath215 , @xmath349 exponentially vanishes to @xmath65 , whereas diverges as @xmath350 , therefore @xmath351 dominates . on",
