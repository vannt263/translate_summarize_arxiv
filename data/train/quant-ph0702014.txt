    "developing a deeper qualitative and quantitative understanding of `` complex '' quantum systems is a broad challenge whose implications range from condensed matter physics to fundamental quantum theory and quantum information science ( qis ) . in a loose sense ,",
    "complexity may be intuitively associated with the lack of a `` simple '' description of physical properties in situations where such a description should _ in principle _ follow from a small set of known , basic rules @xcite . in quantum systems ,",
    "complex quantum features so defined may appear at both the kinematical and dynamical level via three main pathways : large state - space size ; interaction between constituent subsystems ; absence of dynamical regularities and non - integrability .",
    "taken together , these factors may be ultimately held responsible for non - scalable ( typically , exponentially inefficient ) parameterizations of system properties ; the emergence of many - body phenomena and quantum irreversibility ( via interactions both within the system of interest and between the system and its environment ) ; and the possibility of dynamical instability and quantum chaos .",
    "physically , the occurrence of genuinely quantum correlations  entanglement",
    " lies at the heart of all the above phenomena . from a qis perspective",
    ", entanglement is also intimately tied to the inherent complexity that distinguishes quantum from purely classical information processing  being , in particular , the defining resource for quantum communication @xcite as well as a necessary prerequisite for quantum computational speed - up @xcite . in recent years , this has naturally motivated a host of investigations aimed at characterizing the nature and role of entanglement in complex quantum systems . while a complete understanding is far from being reached , important progress",
    "is being made toward elucidating the behavior of entanglement across a quantum phase transition @xcite and across a transition from integrability to quantum chaos @xcite , as well as in better accounting for entanglement in computational schemes for interacting quantum systems , like renormalization group methods @xcite .    in this context , the notion of _ generalized entanglement _ ( ge ) @xcite has recently emerged as a unifying framework for describing entanglement in _ arbitrary _ physical and qis settings  capable , in particular , to recover conventional ( subsystem - based ) entanglement in well - defined conditions and to directly incorporate physical constraints such as quantum indistinguishability . beside providing new lie - algebraic measures for diagnosing broken - symmetry quantum phase transitions in a variety of models @xcite ,",
    "ge has contributed so far to the understanding of standard multipartite spin correlations in disordered lattice systems @xcite , provided a natural testbed for investigating entanglement generation in chaotic quantum maps @xcite , as well as shed light on conditions for quantum - computational speed - up in a wide class of lie - algebraic models @xcite .    here , we continue to explore applications of the ge framework to complex quantum systems by focusing , in particular , on highlighting the relationship between ge measures and _ state delocalization properties _ , as quantified by standard indicators like the _ number of principal components _ with respect to an appropriate basis . in line with the growing body of work at the interface between qis , condensed - matter , and quantum statistical physics @xcite",
    ", our main motivation is to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize points of contact between notions originally developed in different contexts  in the hope that this may lead to useful cross - implications . following a review of the essential ge background in section 2 ,",
    "the relationship between global multipartite entanglement and delocalization is addressed in section 3 , by explicitly uncovering the role of hamming distance in the structure of subsystem - based ge . in section 4 , a general method for estimating the expected ge of _ random pure states _ is presented . in section 5 , a concrete application to a disordered heisenberg spin-@xmath0 chain is discussed .",
    "final remarks conclude in section 6 .",
    "the basic idea of the ge approach is that the entanglement properties of quantum states are determined by the expectation values of a _",
    "distinguished subspace of observables _ rather than a preferred decomposition of the system into subsystems @xcite .",
    "this allows the notion of ge to be meaningful in physical settings which the conventional notion is too narrow to embrace : in particular , ge is directly applicable to systems subject to limitations in the available control interactions and measurements , and described by arbitrary operator languages ( spin , fermion , etc ) as for instance many - body quantum systems .",
    "in addition , because the ge notion rests only on convexity properties of spaces of quantum states and observables , ge is mathematically suited for entanglement formulations in abstract operational theories .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a more expanded discussion .    the starting point for defining ge is to realize that a pure state of a composite quantum system is entangled ( in the usual sense ) iff at least one of the reduced subsystem states is mixed",
    ". let the system of interest be described by a pure state , @xmath1 , with @xmath2 , dim@xmath3 , and @xmath4 being the associated hilbert space and density operator , respectively .",
    "let in addition the distinguished observable set consists of the hermitian operators in a linear subspace @xmath5 of the full operator space on @xmath2 , with @xmath6 closed under hermitian conjugation .",
    "the key step is to replace the notion of reduced state as obtained via a partial trace in the usual tensor - product sense by a notion of reduced state as resulting from the restriction to @xmath6 of the positive linear functional @xmath7 corresponding to @xmath8 via the trace map @xcite .",
    "such a reduction may be specified in terms of the ( unique ) projection map @xmath9 with respect to the trace inner product , @xmath10 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath11 is defined to be _ generalized unentangled relative to @xmath6 _ iff its reduced state @xmath12 is pure  that is , extremal in the space of reduced states @xcite .    while no unique measure suffice to quantify the amount of @xmath6-ge present in @xmath11 , the simplest possibility is to evaluate the square length of @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 be a basis of hermitian traceless operators for @xmath6 , orthogonal in the trace inner product , @xmath15 .",
    "the _ purity of @xmath11 relative to @xmath6 _ ( @xmath6-purity ) is given by @xmath16 where the normalization constant @xmath17 depends in general on @xmath6 and @xmath18 , and ensures that the maximum value of @xmath19 is 1 .",
    "thus , a state @xmath20 with maximal purity , @xmath21 , is unentangled with respect to @xmath6 , hence it has extremal length @xcite . in the physically relevant case where @xmath6 forms a ( irreducibly represented )",
    "lie algebra , maximal @xmath6-purity is both a necessary and sufficient condition for a pure state to be @xmath6-unentangled , @xmath19 is invariant under unitary transformations generated by arbitrary elements of @xmath6 , and ge@xmath22 is an entanglement monotone @xcite .",
    "@xmath19 may be extended to a measure for mixed - state ge via a standard convex - roof construction @xcite .",
    "the following specializations and applications of the above ge definition may serve to clarify the relationship between ge and standard entanglement , and will be especially relevant for the present discussion :    \\(1 ) _ absolute purity_. by definition , @xmath8 is pure iff it is a one - dimensional projector , hence iff @xmath23 . by identifying @xmath6 with the ( real ) lie algebra of _ all _ traceless observables on @xmath2 , @xmath24 , eq .",
    "( [ ph ] ) gives @xmath25 and @xmath26 consistently normalized so that purity is 1 for pure states and 0 for totally mixed ones .",
    "\\(2 ) _ bipartite systems and linear entropy_. for a system consisting of two subsystems @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , dim@xmath30 , dim@xmath31 , the information accessible through measurements on @xmath27 or @xmath28 alone is contained in the reduced density operators @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "as mentioned , a pure state @xmath34 is unentangled , @xmath35 , iff both @xmath36 and @xmath37 , are pure . a bipartite entanglement measure known as the linear entropy @xmath38 ( of either subsystem ) may be constructed as @xmath39 . in the ge approach ,",
    "standard bipartite entanglement is recovered by choosing the set of _ all _ uni - local observables acting on @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 ) alone , e.g. @xmath40 ( equivalently , @xmath41 ) .",
    "( [ ph ] ) then yields @xmath42 that is , ge@xmath43 is directly proportional to the linear subsystem entropy .",
    "\\(3 ) _ multipartite systems and average subsystem purity_. the above example generalizes to a multipartite system consisting of @xmath44 subsystems of dimension @xmath45 . that is , conventional ( subsystem - based ) entanglement",
    "is recovered by selecting the algebra of all uni - local observables acting on individual subsystems as distinguished observables , @xmath46 .",

    "@xmath48 attains its maximum 1 only for completely separable states , @xmath49 , and is equal to 0 iff each reduced density matrix is totally mixed ( hence no information is available through local operations ) .",
    "the entanglement measure ge@xmath50 is thus proportional to the average linear entropy over all bi - partitions of the system into blocks of @xmath51 and @xmath52 subsystems . for qubit systems ( @xmath53 ) ,",
    "such a measure has been shown in @xcite and @xcite to coincide with global multipartite entanglement @xmath54 as introduced by meyer - wallach @xcite , @xmath55 .",
    "\\(4 ) _ expected @xmath6-purity of a set of states_. for a fixed observable set , the expected @xmath6-purity of a pure state taken with respect to a certain probability distribution @xmath56 quantifies ge properties of a _ typical _ state in the ensemble , @xmath57 an important instance arises for uniformly sampled random pure states , in which case @xmath56 coincides with the unitarily invariant haar measure on @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "given an orthonormal basis @xmath59 in @xmath2 , a well - established measure of state delocalization in quantum statistical physics and quantum chaos is the _ number of principal components _",
    "( @xmath60 ) , @xmath61 quantifying the number of basis states on which @xmath11 has a significant amplitude @xmath62 .",
    "npc so defined ranges from a minimum value of 1 , meaning that @xmath11 coincides with a single basis element , to a maximum of @xmath18 , corresponding to a maximally delocalized state with equal probabilities @xmath63 .",
    "if @xmath64 , measurements in the corresponding basis will result in a probability distribution over possible outcomes .",
    "for instance , a crossover from localization to delocalization with respect to a large number of basis states occurs in the eigenvectors of the anderson model during the insulator - to - metal transition , as well as in the eigenvectors of quantum spin lattices across a transition to quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "npc is equivalently referred to as _ participation ratio _ ( or participation number @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , @xmath65 will be often denoted here as _ inverse participation ratio _ ( ipr ) @xcite .    from a conceptual standpoint , it is interesting to observe that @xmath66 ( and ipr ) may be directly related to an appropriate @xmath6-purity .",
    "specifically , let @xmath67 denote the subspace of all ( traceless ) observables which are diagonal in the chosen orthonormal basis @xmath59 .",
    "then , @xmath68 such an observable space may be considered the commutant of a non - degenerate hamiltonian and forms a trivial , abelian lie algebra . as such @xmath69 does not identify a decomposition into quantum subsystems , and ge@xmath70 need not have any relationship to entanglement in the standard sense . clearly",
    ", @xmath71 iff @xmath72 .",
    "thus , in a sense , @xmath73 may be also thought as quantifying how non - classical @xmath11 is relative to the given basis .",
    "our next objective is to investigate to what extent a relation similar to eq .",
    "( [ pdiag ] ) may exist between standard entanglement ( as quantified by @xmath74 ) and @xmath60 , as evaluated in each of a maximal set of mutually unbiased product bases @xcite .",
    "a product basis is one where each basis state is unentangled .",
    "two bases are mutually unbiased if localization in one basis implies maximal delocalization in the other . in general , we shall find that @xmath74 is not solely a function of @xmath60 in these bases , but it also depends on additional structure of the input state .",
    "focus on a system consisting of @xmath44 qubits ( spin-@xmath0 ) first , @xmath75 .",
    "the bases @xmath76 , consisting of the joint eigenstates of qubit observables @xmath77 , @xmath78 , provide a natural maximal set of mutually unbiased product bases .",
    "let @xmath79 denote the components of @xmath20 in the basis @xmath76 .",
    "the local purity @xmath74 may then be expressed as @xmath80 , where @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "recall that the _ hamming distance _ between two binary bit strings of equal length measures the number of substitutions required to change one into the other .",
    "we have :    lemma 3.1 . for every pure state @xmath11 of @xmath44 qubits ,",
    "the following identity holds : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the hamming distance between basis states @xmath84 and @xmath85 that is , the number of instances where the eigenvalues of @xmath86 differ on @xmath84 and @xmath85 .    proof .",
    "note that we may express @xmath87 where the ( un)primed sum is over all @xmath88 such that the @xmath89-th basis state has a ( 0)1 for the @xmath90-th qubit . squaring both sides yields @xmath91 from the normalization of @xmath11 one obtains @xmath92 substituting ( [ norm ] ) into ( [ longeq ] ) yields @xmath93 note that this sum is over all pairs such that @xmath84 and @xmath94 differ on the @xmath90th qubit .",
    "hence , the number of occurrences of a term @xmath95 in the sum yielding @xmath96 , which is over all qubits , is equal to the hamming distance between @xmath84 and @xmath85 , whereby the result.@xmath97    note the structural similarity between the expressions for @xmath96 and @xmath98 , eqs .",
    "( [ flips ] ) and ( [ norm ] )  the main difference being that in @xmath96 the products @xmath95 are weighted by hamming distance whereas in @xmath98 they are not .",
    "we have the following :    theorem 3.1 .",
    "assume that for each basis @xmath99 , the values of the terms @xmath95 are independent on average upon hamming distance ( _ uncorrelation assumption _ ) .",
    "then for every pure state @xmath11 of @xmath44 qubits , @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the dimension of the hilbert space .    proof .",
    "let @xmath102 denote the average over all pairs @xmath103 , constrained to a specific hamming - distance value @xmath104 , and let @xmath105 denote the unconstrained average over all @xmath89 and @xmath106 .",
    "then the weighted average over all pairs @xmath103 may be separated into the sum of averages over pairs corresponding to a given @xmath107 , @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the number of pairs @xmath103 with fixed hamming distance @xmath107 . under the uncorrelation assumption , each of the ratios @xmath110 , irrespective of @xmath107 .",
    "thus , by invoking the expression of @xmath96 in lemma 3.1 , and by making the average over pairs defining @xmath111 explicit , @xmath112 to evaluate @xmath113 , first note that for each state , @xmath114 , there are @xmath115 states labelled by @xmath106 that are hamming distance @xmath107 from @xmath114 .",

    "the result follows .",
    "@xmath97    thus , @xmath74 depends in general on both the @xmath60 in a set of three mutually unbiased product bases and on the _ average correlation of the products @xmath121 with respect to hamming distance _ in each basis .      for states obeying certain symmetries , the number of bases involved in the relationship between delocalization and @xmath74 may be reduced .",
    "a first physically relevant example is provided by states invariant under a non - standard ( anti - unitary ) time reversal symmetry @xmath122 such that @xmath123 @xcite .",

    "as such , the expression for a state in this basis may be considered a standard canonical form which generalizes ( non - uniquely ) the schmidt decomposition for bipartite systems @xcite .",
    "( [ flips2 ] ) and , under appropriate conditions , theorem 3.1 , may be generalized to a system consisting of @xmath44 @xmath45-dimensional subsystems ( qudits ) .    to this end , begin by observing that because each reduced density matrix is hermitian , it is always possible ( similar to the @xmath53 case ) to find a product basis where each qudit reduced density matrix is diagonal .",
    "let each state in such a basis be specified in terms of quantum numbers @xmath164 , where @xmath165 labels a state of the @xmath90-th qudit and may take any of @xmath45 possible values .",
    "let @xmath166 , where @xmath89 is a collective index ranging over all possible strings of values @xmath167 . the reduced density matrix for the @xmath90-th qudit",
    "may then be expressed as @xmath168 , whereby @xmath169 is the sum over all terms @xmath170 such that @xmath171 .",

    "now @xmath176 . using the identity @xmath177 ,",
    "this may be rewritten as @xmath178 .",
    "thus , @xmath179    when the value of @xmath45 is such that a maximal set of @xmath180 mutually unbiased bases spanning the state space of each qudit exists , the construction in @xcite implies the existence of an hermitian operator basis for the unilocal observables on each qudit which is partitioned into @xmath180 maximally commuting subsets . accordingly",
    ", the local purity may be written as @xmath181 , where @xmath96 is the purity with respect to a choice of one maximally commuting set of basis operators for each of the qudits .",
    "the operators contributing to each @xmath96 uniquely define ( up to irrelevant relabeling transformations ) a product basis , @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is a collective index for the local quantum numbers , @xmath184 , which label the mutually unbiased bases of each qudit .",

    "the requirement of hamming uncorrelation which is responsible for a simple relationship between global multipartite entanglement and delocalization is naturally satisfied on average by certain classes of random states .",

    "the random assignment of probabilities ensures that in the @xmath124 basis no correlation between component products and hamming distance exists on average .",
    "furthermore , the random phases ensure hamming uncorrelation in the @xmath196 and @xmath197 bases also .",

    "we have quantified the relationship between delocalization as measured by @xmath60 in a maximal set of mutually unbiased product bases and global entanglement as measured by local purity . in general , the relationship between the two depends on how products of state vector components are _ correlated with respect to hamming distance _  or a suitable generalization for higher - dimensional subsystems . under the condition that no such correlation exists , a simple relationship between @xmath60 in each basis and local purity is established . for states with certain physically relevant symmetries , the number of bases may be reduced .",

    "such analysis yields an expression for local entanglement , ge@xmath331 , as the expectation value of hamming distance between measurements of two copies of the same pure state in the state - dependent canonical basis where each reduced density matrix is diagonal .",
    "distributions of random states under which the assumption of uncorrelation is naturally satisfied are also discussed . a simple method to calculate the expected relative purity over an ensemble of pure states invariant under the haar measure",

    "lastly , the connection between local purity and correlations between products of components is investigated numerically for a disordered heisenberg spin chain . because the deviation of the relationship between @xmath332 and @xmath139 from that predicted under the uncorrelation assumption is likely a consequence of the two - body nature of the interaction , a similar relationship",
    "is predicted to hold for any disordered qubit system with two - body interactions which has symmetry properties allowing @xmath66 in a single basis to enter the relationship with @xmath74 . for systems without such symmetries , we conjecture that the @xmath96 associated with @xmath60 in the eigenbasis of @xmath302 will still provide the main contribution to @xmath74 , until the eigenvectors are maximally random .",
