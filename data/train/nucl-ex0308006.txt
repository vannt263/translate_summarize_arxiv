    "lattice quantum - chromo - dynamic ( qcd ) calculations predict a new state of matter of deconfined quarks and gluons at an energy density exceeding @xmath81  gev/@xmath9  @xcite .",
    "it has long been suggested that such a `` quark gluon plasma '' may be produced in collisions between ultra - relativistic heavy nuclei  @xcite .",
    "indeed , measurements of transverse energy produced in high energy @xmath10 and @xmath2 collision suggest that energy densities above 3  gev/@xmath9 at sps  @xcite and 5  gev/@xmath9 at rhic  @xcite have been reached . however , this conclusion relies on model assumptions  @xcite to relate the properties of the hadronic final state to the initial state dynamics .",
    "the spectra of high transverse momentum ( @xmath5 ) hadrons resulting from the fragmentation of hard - scattered partons potentially provide a direct probe of the properties of the initial state .",
    "theoretical calculations show that the outgoing high-@xmath5 partons radiate substantially more energy when propagating through dense matter than when propagating in the vacuum , resulting in a softening of the hadron @xmath5 spectrum  @xcite , with the energy loss of the partons depending on the gluon density of the matter  @xcite .",
    "formation time considerations suggest that hard scattered partons are `` produced '' at the earliest stage of the collision , thus directly probe the dense matter from the time of their creation .",
    "therefore , a detailed analysis of high-@xmath5 hadron production may reveal information on the properties of the dense medium created early in the collisions  @xcite .    at the energies reached at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , high-@xmath5",
    "hadrons are copiously produced . in nucleon - nucleon collisions , it has been well established that hadrons with @xmath11 2 gev/@xmath1 result primarily from the fragmentation of hard - scattered partons , and that the @xmath5 spectra of these hadrons can be calculated using perturbative qcd ( pqcd )  @xcite .",
    "initial measurements of hadron @xmath5 spectra in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath3 = 130 gev led to the discovery of a substantial suppression of hadron yields per nucleon - nucleon collision relative to pp data  @xcite .",
    "data from @xmath3 = 200 gev confirm these results  @xcite .",
    "the suppression is observed in central but not in peripheral collisions .",
    "these observations are consistent with pqcd - inspired modelling of parton energy loss in dense matter  @xcite .",
    "however , alternative interpretations that do not assume the formation of a deconfined phase have been proposed based on the modifications of the parton distribution functions in the initial state  @xcite or final - state hadronic interactions  @xcite .",
    "in addition to hadron suppression , an unexpectedly large fraction of baryons has been observed in central @xmath2 collisions for @xmath5 up to 45  gev/@xmath1  @xcite , which complicates the interpretation of the high @xmath5 results .",
    "the observed baryon to meson ratio from phenix  @xcite is inconsistent with jet fragmentation in @xmath7  @xcite and @xmath12 collisions  @xcite .",
    "while the origin of this effect is unclear , it could point towards bulk particle production ( `` soft physics '' ) contributing to the @xmath5 spectra out to 45 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "it has been suggested that coalescence of thermalized quarks combining with energy loss of hard - scattered partons can account for the unusual particle composition , which shifts the region dominated by hard - scattering to higher @xmath5  @xcite .",
