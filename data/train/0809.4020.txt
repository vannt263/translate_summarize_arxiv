    "due to the absence of exact solutions on most systems , monte carlo methods play an important role not only in statistical physics and critical phenomena but also in other areas .",
    "usually , the metropolis @xcite and the glauber @xcite algorithms are used to lead the system to the gibbs distribution . despite their simplicity and generality",
    ", difficulties appears in studying the emergence of phase transitions when they are used to generate the microscopic configurations .",
    "several techniques have been proposed to circumvent these difficulties , such as the multicanonical technique @xcite , cluster algorithms ( that work properly not only for reducing critical slowing down @xcite , but also for eliminating metastability in first - order transitions @xcite ) , the wang - landau method @xcite , simulated tempering @xcite , and replicas exchanges also named _ parallel tempering methods _ ( pt ) @xcite .",
    "special attention has been devoted to this latter approach , due to its relative simplicity in comparison with other approaches and its enormous applicability for several systems in the framework of both statistical mechanics @xcite and molecular dynamics @xcite . essentially , the pt consists of simulating simultaneously a given set of replicas of the same system at different temperatures and , occasionally , interchanging the configuration of two randomly chosen elements of those replicas .",
    "this exchange between pairs of replicas allows for the implementation of an ergodic walk in the configuration space when the elements of the pair are separated by large free energy barriers .",
    "although the pt has been widely used in several contexts , an open question concerns its applicability for the investigation of first - order phase transitions @xcite .",
    "in fact , since in discontinuous transitions a gap in the energy might lead to a small probability of accepting exchanges between replicas this appears not to be a favorable scenario for pt .    in this paper",
    ", we give a further step in this direction by applying the pt to study and characterize first - order transitions .",
    "we will consider the well known spin-1 blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) model @xcite , which possess a rather rich phase diagram with different structures , including first - order transitions in the regime of low temperatures .",
    "as we shall see , the pt can be applied because thermodynamic properties are actually described by continuous functions when finite systems are simulated .",
    "in fact , the discontinuity of thermodynamic properties occur only in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , smooth curves are obtained only when one uses a dynamics yielding a correct sampling of the configuration space @xcite . in particular",
    ", the use of the pt allows for applying a new finite size procedure for the study of first - order phase transitions , as proposed in ref .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a pt - based analysis of first - order transitions has recently been proposed by neuhaus et al @xcite .",
    "such approach is , however , rather different from the one adopted here .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we present the model , in sec .",
    "iii we describe the pt , in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the numerical results , and in sec . v the conclusions .",
    "the spin-1 beg model is described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the spin variable of the @xmath2th site of the lattice which assumes the values @xmath3 and @xmath4 and the sums run over the nearest neighbor spins on a @xmath5dimensional lattice with @xmath6 sites .",
    "parameters @xmath7 are the nearest - neighbor spin couplings and @xmath8 is the quadrupole moment .",
    "we have two order parameters defined as follows : @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the beg model will be consider for a square lattice and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "in the parallel tempering method ( pt ) , configurations at high temperatures are used to perform an ergodic walk in low temperatures . to this end , we simulate , for fixed values of @xmath8 , a set of @xmath11 replicas in the interval of temperatures @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are extreme temperatures .",
    "the dynamics is composed of two parts . in the first part",
    ", each one of the @xmath11 replicas are simulated according to the metropolis algorithm . for the @xmath2th replica",
    "a given site @xmath15 of the system is chosen at random and we select , with equal probability , one of the two other possible spin values @xmath16 such that @xmath17 .",
    "the spin variable @xmath18 is then replaced with @xmath19 according to the metropolis prescription : @xmath20 @xcite , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in the second part of the dynamics",
    ", the pt is implemented .",
    "after a given number of monte carlo steps , the exchange of configurations of two replicas at the temperatures @xmath23 and @xmath24 are performed with the probability @xmath25 \\}$ ] , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 denotes the `` distance '' between two arbitrary replicas .",
    "the probability @xmath29 depends on @xmath30 and for this reason the performance of method will depend on the `` distance '' between the replicas .",
    "if the difference is large enough exchanges will be hardly performed and the pt will not provide any improvement in the results .    in this paper ,",
    "we adopt two independent procedures to choose the interval of temperatures . in the first one ,",
    "the distance between adjacent temperatures obey a geometric progression .",
    "some authors have shown @xcite that while this procedure works well when specific heat of the system is about constant , at the emergence of a phase transition , when the specific heat diverges , its efficiency is reduced .",
    "for this reason , we adopted a second procedure , that consists in distributing temperatures in regular intervals between @xmath13 and @xmath14 for a given small size system . by increasing @xmath31 ,",
    "we * introduce * additional temperatures between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this procedure is necessary because the exchange probability in general decreases as @xmath31 increases .",
    "we have verified that both procedures lead to the same results , within of the statistical errors .    concerning the replicas exchanges we also consider exchanges between nonadjacent sites .",
    "this is implemented in this work by allowing @xmath28 to range in the interval @xmath34 .",
    "as it will be shown , although non - adjacent exchanges have been less studied @xcite , because the probability of performing a given exchange decreases when @xmath28 increases , they have revealed to be essential mechanisms in eliminating hysteretic effects .",
    "we have simulated three different values of @xmath35 , given by @xmath360 , 3 , and 3.3 .",
    "note that the first case ( @xmath37 ) corresponds to the well known blume - capel model .",
    "replicas are distributed in the intervals @xmath38 , for @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , for @xmath37 .",
    "we have simulated system with size @xmath31 ranging from @xmath42 up to @xmath43 and we considered @xmath44 monte carlo steps to evaluate the appropriate quantities after equilibrating the system .",
    "for all values of @xmath35 considered here , the system displays two ferromagnetic phases ( rich at spins @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) for small values of @xmath8 . also , a paramagnetic phase ( rich at spins 0 ) takes place for high values of @xmath8 .",
    "a strong first - order phase transition between the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phase occurs for a given value of @xmath8 that depends on @xmath35 and @xmath47 .     as a function of @xmath8 for @xmath39 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 obtained from parallel tempering ( symbol @xmath50 ) and cluster algorithms ( circles ) .",
    "squares correspond to data obtained from parallel tempering with exchanges only between nearest - neighbor replicas . in the inset",
    ", circles and triangles refer to the metropolis algorithm , whereas the symbol @xmath50 refers to the parallel tempering . ]",
    "the first inspection about the applicability of the pt for first - order transitions is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where we compare the pt results with those obtained by using only the metropolis algorithm . by simulating only with the metropolis algorithm ,",
    "the system gets trapped in metastable states and even after @xmath44 mc steps it does not undergo a transition to the stable phase . this effect does not occur when we use the pt with nonlocal exchanges , since the system becomes able to pass from one phase to the other . the efficiency of the pt is also corroborated by the agreement with results obtained from cluster algorithms @xcite , where a smooth curve is obtained for the order parameter . however , as it was mentioned previously , when one considers only exchanges of configurations between nearest - neighbor replicas , hysteresis are still present , as showed in fig.[fig1 ] .    the role of non - local exchanges is analyzed in more details by considering the time evolution of thermodynamic properties at the phase coexistence . in fig",
    ".  [ fig11 ] we plot , for a single run , the order parameter @xmath51 starting from two different initial configurations for @xmath39 , @xmath48 and @xmath52 . in the inset of each graph , we plot the time evolution of the total energy per volume @xmath53 for the same initial configurations .",
    "in contrast with the pt , until @xmath54 mc steps , the simulation is not ergodic when the system is simulated with the metropolis algorithm .     for a single run starting from two independent initial configurations simulated with ( a ) the metropolis algorithm and @xmath55 the pt , for @xmath52 , @xmath48 , @xmath56 , and @xmath39 . in the insets the time evolution of the total energy per volume @xmath53",

    "the minimum in @xmath64 occurs at @xmath65 , indicating the coexistence between the ferromagnetic phases , paramagnetic rich at spins 0 and a disordered phase , that takes place in the limit of high temperatures @xcite .",

    "@xcite by means of two different reasonings , the point where all isotherms cross is independent of the lattice size .",
