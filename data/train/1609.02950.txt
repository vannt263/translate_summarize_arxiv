    "in a regression model , if the distribution of the response variable is highly skewed , traditional mean regression model may fail to describe interesting aspect of the relationship between the prediction and response variables .",
    "for instance , if we deal with the income distribution data of a certain state or country , the traditional mean regression will get affected by the outliers , i.e. , the income of top 12 % people of that region , and hence is of limited use for prediction of income of general people .",
    "this situation arises often in business , economics , environmental and many other fields . as an alternative to traditional linear regression ,",
    "quantile regression is one of the most popular and useful regression technique .",
    "extensive research have been done on quantile regression .",
    "most of them were approached from the frequentist perspective ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite estimated the @xmath2th regression quantile for the dataset @xmath3 , by minimizing the loss function @xmath4 $ ] with respect to @xmath5 and @xmath6 . due to computational convenience and other theoretical properties",
    ", this method remained popular for long time .",
    "later on , many other methods of quantile regression were proposed both in frequentist and bayesian framework .",
    "@xcite introduced bayesian quantile regression for independent data .",
    "a few generalization and extension of quantile regression were proposed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these papers mainly focused on quantile regression for a single quantile level for censored independent data .",
    "@xcite proposed the single level quantile regression model with subject specific random intercept term which accounts for within group correlation .",
    "the drawback of separate quantile regression for different quantiles is that the natural ordering among different quantiles is not ensured . in other words",
    ", the lower quantile estimation curves might cross the upper quantile curves which violates the ordering of quantiles of a fixed distribution .",
    "there exist a few methods addressing the crossing issue in estimating multiple quantile regression .",
    "@xcite proposed a method of estimating non - crossing quantile curves assuming a heteroskedastic model for response variable . under this assumption",
    ", predictors might affect the response variable via a location and scale change .",
    "@xcite proposed a method of estimating the quantile curve by linear interpolation on the estimated quantile curves on a grid of quantiles . @xcite and @xcite used support vector machines ( svm , @xcite ) for non - crossing quantile regression .",
    "but , as mentioned in @xcite , a disadvantage of using svm for non - crossing quantile regression is that when multiple quantiles are needed , every adjacent pair of conditional quantile functions should be computed .",
    "@xcite proposed non - crossing quantile regression using doubly penalized kernal machine ( dpkm ) . for this method also , we need to compute quantile curves separately for each quantile .",
    "the method proposed in @xcite sequentially updates the quantile curves under the contraint that the upper quantile curves stay above the lower ones .",
    "a drawback of this method is that the predicted quantile curves are dependent on the grid of quantiles for which we want to calculate the quantile curves .",
    "quantile regression for fixed number of levels of quantiles with monotonicity constraint was proposed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the method proposed in @xcite is sensitive to the number of prediction quantile levels . for spatial quantile regression @xcite",
    "used bernstein polynomial to maintain the monotonicity constraint of the quantile function . @xcite",
    "proposed non - crossing multiple quantile regression using piece - wise gaussian basis functions to interpolate the quantile function at different quantile levels .",
    "@xcite suggested the use of different symmetric and asymmetric quantile functions for modeling based on the data .",
    "models based on a fixed number of quantiles do not give the estimates of all quantiles and may also be sensitive to the number and the location of the grid points of the quantile levels , which is not desirable .    instead of fitting quantile curves for a fixed set of quantiles ,",
    "a more informative picture emerges by estimating the entire quantile curve .",
    "suppose @xmath7 denote the @xmath2-th conditional quantile @xmath8 of a response @xmath9 at @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the predictor .",
    "a linear simultaneous quantile regression model for @xmath12 at a given @xmath2 is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the intercept and @xmath15 is the slope smoothly varying as function of @xmath2 . thus estimating the quantile function involves non - parametric estimation of the function @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the main challenge in fitting this kind of model remains in complying with the monotonicity restriction of the predicted quantile lines @xmath16 as a function of all values of the predictor @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite obtained a very useful characterization of the monotonicity constraint ( see equation ( [ eq : theorem ] ) below ) .",
    "they used the characterization to propose a suitable prior on the quantile function in a bayesian approach , and computed the posterior distribution of the quantile curves .",
    "more specifically , they used two ( possibly ) dependent gaussian processes @xmath17 and @xmath18 to induce prior on @xmath14 and @xmath15 in such a way so that @xmath12 remains a monotonically increasing function of @xmath2 .",
    "gaussian processes do not have any shape restriction . to induce monotonicity property on @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xcite took the running integral of the exponential transformation of two ( possibly correlated ) gaussian processes . to evaluate the likelihood",
    ", it requires solving the equation @xmath19 ( see equation ( [ tau_x_y ] ) below ) . without having a convenient expression , the solution needs to be done completely numerically which involves computing integrals of transformed gaussian process over a very fine grid .",
    "substantial improvement in computing approach is possible using a finite random series prior ( @xcite ) . especially using a b - spline basis , monotonicity can be ensured by choosing a prior only on coefficients in increasing order .",
    "piece - wise polynomial representation of splines allows obtaining @xmath20 solving analytically .",
    "thus we can reduce computation time substantially using a random series prior based on the b - spline basis .",
    "we observe @xmath21 independent random samples @xmath22 of an explanatory variable @xmath11 and a response variable @xmath9 , both of which are assumed to be univariate . by monotonic transformations ,",
    "we transform both of them to the unit interval . from theorem 1 of @xcite",
    ", it follows that a linear specification @xmath23 , @xmath24 $ ] , is monotonically increasing in @xmath2 for every @xmath25 $ ] if and only if @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are positive constants and @xmath29 \\mapsto [ 0,1]$ ] are monotonically increasing in @xmath30@xmath31@xmath32 $ ] .",

    "function estimation on a bounded interval through b - spline basis expansion is one of the most convenient approaches . to construct a prior on the quantile function @xmath12 , or equivalently on @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ", we need to ensure their monotonically increasing properties .",
    "if the coefficients in a b - spline basis expansion are in increasing order , then the corresponding quantile function will be an increasing function of @xmath2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , if the target function is strictly increasing , the quality of the approximation of spline expansions is maintained when the coefficients are restricted by increasing order ( @xcite ) .",
    "this motivates us to use b - splines with increasing coefficients as the basis of the quantile function .",
    "the degree of b - spline determines the degree of smoothness , in that quadratic splines are continuously differentiable , cubic splines are continuously twice differentiable and so on , and are able to optimally approximate functions of smoothness index only up to the degree of splines .",
    "thus optimal estimation of smoother functions requires higher degree splines . on the other hand ,",
    "computational complexity increases with the degree of the b - spline basis .",
    "smoothness of order higher than two is typically not visually distinguishable from smoothness of order @xmath55 , and therefore splines of degree up to 3 suffices in most applications . in case of quadratic b - spline basis",
    ", @xmath12 is a linear combination of piecewise second degree polynomials in terms of @xmath2 , and hence restricted to an interval between two knots , @xmath12 is an increasing quadratic function .",
    "thus we can solve @xmath56 for each data points @xmath57 analytically , unlike the case of gaussian process prior , where one has to use numerically integrate and apply iterative newton - raphson method to solve them for each realization of the quantile process from its posterior distribution . due to the increasing complexity and higher computation time ,",
    "results for with b - splines of order higher than 3 have not been shown in this paper .",
    "for a cubic b - spline , @xmath12 is linear combination of piecewise third degree polynomials .",
    "hence , for any given interval in the domain , @xmath12 is a monotonically increasing third degree polynomial .",
    "hence in this case also , @xmath20 can be solved analytically .",
    "however the analytic algorithm for solving cubic equation requires computing all three roots even though only one root falls in the admissible interval , which makes the cost of computing roots in a cubic equation substantial . due to the monotonicity of @xmath12 , the bisection method of finding roots",
    "is an attractive alternative . in our numerical experiments",
    ", we found that for cubic splines the bisection method is slightly faster than the analytical approach .",
    "let @xmath58 be the equidistant knots on the interval @xmath32 $ ] where @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",

    "we consider the following basis expansion of the quantile functions through the relations @xmath64 taking @xmath65 ensures @xmath66 and @xmath67 ensures @xmath68 .",

    "a natural prior is thus given by the uniform distribution on the unit simplex , or the dirichlet prior with parameter @xmath75 .",
    "the bayesian procedures based on quadratic splines ( i.e. @xmath76 ) will be called the quadratic spline simultaneous quantile regression ( qssqr ) and that based on cubic splines ( i.e. @xmath77 ) will be called the cubic spline simultaneous quantile regression ( cssqr ) .      to compute the log - likelihood function ,",
    "we proceed like @xcite . by ( [ eq : density ] )",

    "marginal probabilities corresponding to different values of @xmath105 are obtained from separate mcmc output for each value of @xmath105 .",

    "an alternative approach is to use the hierarchical bayes approach , denoted by hb , which is a combination of a reasonable range of numbers of b - spline basis function with weights proportional to their model posterior probabilities . from the simulation study on rmise and posterior coverage of the credible bands ,",
    "we note somewhat higher accuracy with hb approach over the eb .",
    "since , computation time for both of these methods are the same , hb is preferred over the eb .",
    "even though the use of cubic b - spline basis function is more time consuming than that of the quadratic b - spline basis , we do not find any noticeable improvement in accuracy by using the former over the latter .",
    "however the cubic b - spline approach produces estimates which are second order continuously differentiable , instead of only continuously differentiable estimates obtained by the quadratic b - spline approach .    unlike most of the previous works on non - crossing quantile regression , the proposed method can estimate the slope and the intercept of the quantile regression equation as continuous function of @xmath2 .",
    "most existing methods for non - crossing quantile regression depend on the chosen grid of @xmath2 values where the quantile regression coefficients are estimated . due to the use of characterization of required monotonicity of the simultaneous linear quantile regression ,",
    "it can be avoided in our approach .",
    "besides , estimating the quantile regression equation simultaneously gives further insight on the dependence structure of the predictor and the response variable instead of looking at a fixed and finite number of quantiles .    for the b - spline basis expansion approach , in the likelihood evaluation step , due the piece - wise polynomial structure of b - spline basis function , we can solve the equation ( [ tau_x_y ] ) analytically unlike using the gaussian process prior where only a numerical solution can be obtained after implementing numerical integration based on a chosen grid . in our proposed method , dependency structure of the slope ,",
    "intercept and the quantile function of the regression equation with the spline coefficients being linear , it is enough to track the posterior mean of the spline coefficients for the estimation purpose .",
    "evaluation and storage of the estimated quantile functions at grid points over the domain of estimation is unnecessary for our method since , those can be directly derived from the posterior mean of the estimated spline coefficients .",
    "so we can unfold each and every details of our estimation by only using posterior mean of a few number of parameters ( and model weight vector for hb ) .",
    "this is sharply in contrast of using a gaussian process prior , for which each realization of the quantile function from its posterior distribution needs to be stored on a grid .",
    "the grid also needs to be sufficiently fine to maintain accuracy and smoothness .",
    "though taking more dense grid would improve the quality of estimation , on the other hand , it would increase the computation time and will lead to the problems of singularity of co - variance matrix of the underlying gaussian process . again for estimation , we need to evaluate the estimated quantile function at any point by kriging or interpolation .",
    "b - spline method does not need any subsequent kriging or interpolation step as the entire estimation is obtained from the estimated coefficients . in our simulation study , we noted that the proposed method based on b - spline basis expansion has slightly more accuracy than the gaussian process based method for simultaneous quantile regression and several other non - crossing quantile regression methods .",
    "application of our method on the north atlantic hurricane intensity data reveals that the intensity of the strongest hurricanes in the north atlantic basin have gotten more stronger whereas we did not notice any significant increase in the wind speeds of the hurricanes near median or lower quantiles over the time period 19812006 .",
    "we also applied this method to analyze the rate of change of county level population in the 4 regions of usa , namely , the northeast , midwest , south and west , based on the 5-yearly data over the period 19852010 .",
    "it gives us a broader look into how the county population of different regions of usa are changing over time .",
    "we note that except sparsely populated counties of the midwest , the population has generally increased over time in all regions .",
    "we take the uniform prior on @xmath271 and @xmath272 ( i.e. , dirichlet(1,  ,1 ) ) .",
    "we generate sequences @xmath273 and @xmath274 of independent random variables from @xmath275 for some @xmath88 .",
    "since @xmath271 and @xmath272 are independent and @xmath273 and @xmath274 are also independent , it is enough to show the results for the first variable transition steps and following conditionals . for the second set of variables , the results will follow similarly .",
    "below @xmath276 will stand for a generic ( joint ) density .",
    "define @xmath277 .",
