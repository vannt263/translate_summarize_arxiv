    "theoretical studies suggest that baryon matter at sufficiently high density and sufficiently low temperature is a color superconductor .",

    ", the density might be as large as @xmath0 where @xmath1 @xmath2 is the saturation density .",
    "it is possible that baryonic matter is deconfined under such conditions and , perhaps , it is color - superconducting",
    ".    in compact stars , matter in the bulk is neutral with respect to the electric and color charges .",
    "matter should also remain in @xmath3 equilibrium .",
    "taking these constraints consistently into account may have a strong effect on the competition between different phases of deconfined quark matter at large baryon densities @xcite . in this paper , we study this competition within the framework of a nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model .",
    "the results are summarized in the phase diagram in the plane of temperature ( @xmath4 ) and quark chemical potential ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the first attempt to obtain the phase diagram of dense , locally neutral three - flavor quark matter as a function of the strange quark mass , the quark chemical potential , and the temperature was made in ref .",
    "it was shown that , at zero temperature and small values of the strange quark mass , the ground state of matter corresponds to the color - flavor - locked ( cfl ) phase @xcite . at some critical value of the strange quark mass , this is replaced by the gapless cfl ( gcfl ) phase @xcite .",
    "in addition , several other phases were found at nonzero temperature .",
    "for instance , it was shown that there should exist a metallic cfl ( mcfl ) phase , a so - called usc phase @xcite , as well as the standard two - flavor color - superconducting ( 2sc ) phase @xcite and the gapless 2sc ( g2sc ) phase @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effect of the strange quark mass was incorporated only approximately through a shift of the chemical potential of strange quarks , @xmath6 .",
    "while such an approach is certainly reliable at small values of the strange quark mass , it becomes uncontrollable with increasing the mass .",
    "the phase diagram of ref .",
    "@xcite was further developed in refs .",
    "@xcite where the shift - approximation in dealing with the strange quark was not employed any more .",
    "so far , however , quark masses were treated as free parameters , rather than dynamically generated quantities . in this paper , we study the phase diagram of dense , locally neutral three - flavor quark matter within the njl model , treating dynamically generated quark masses self - consistently . some results within this approach at zero temperature were also obtained in refs .",

    "the phase diagram is dominated by the normal phase in which the approximate chiral symmetry is broken , and in which quarks have relatively large constituent masses .",
    "this is denoted by @xmath101sb in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] .",
    "with increasing the temperature , this phase changes smoothly into the nq phase in which quark masses are relatively small . because of explicit breaking of the chiral symmetry in the model at hand",
    ", there is no need for a phase transition between the two regimes .",
    "however , as pointed out above , the symmetry argument does not exclude the possibility of an `` accidental '' ( first - order ) chiral phase transition .",
    "as expected , at lower temperatures we find a line of first - order chiral phase transitions .",
    "it is located within a relatively narrow window of the quark chemical potentials ( @xmath102 ) which are of the order of the vacuum values of the light - quark constituent masses .",
    "( for the parameters used in our calculations one obtains @xmath103 and @xmath104 in vacuum @xcite . ) at this critical line , the quark chiral condensates , as well as the quark constituent masses , change discontinuously . with increasing temperature ,",
    "the size of the discontinuity decreases , and the line terminates at the endpoint located at @xmath105 , see fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] .",
    "the location of the critical endpoint is consistent with other mean field studies of njl models with similar sets of parameters @xcite .",
    "this agreement does not need to be exact because , in contrast to the studies in refs .",
    "@xcite , here we imposed the condition of electric charge neutrality in quark matter .",
    "( note that the color neutrality is satisfied automatically in the normal phase . )",
    "one may argue , however , that the additional constraint of neutrality is unlikely to play a big role in the vicinity of the endpoint .",
    "it is appropriate to mention here that the location of the critical endpoint might be affected very much by fluctuations of the composite chiral fields .",
    "these are not included in the mean - field studies of the njl model .",
    "in fact , this is probably the main reason for their inability to pin down the location of the critical endpoint consistent , for example , with lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "( it is fair to mention that the current lattice calculations are not very reliable at nonzero @xmath5 either . ) therefore , the predictions of this study , as well as of those in refs .",
    "@xcite , regarding the critical endpoint can not be considered as very reliable .",
    "when the quark chemical potential exceeds some critical value and the temperature is not too large , a cooper instability with respect to diquark condensation should develop in the system . without enforcing neutrality ,",
    "i.e. , if the chemical potentials of up and down quarks are equal , this happens immediately after the chiral phase transition when the density becomes nonzero  @xcite . in the present model , this is not the case at low temperatures .    in order to understand this ,",
    "let us inspect the various quantities at @xmath106 which are displayed in the upper three panels of fig .",
    "[ plot0 - 20 - 40 ] . at the chiral phase boundary ,",
    "the up and down quark masses become relatively small , whereas the strange quark mass experiences only a moderate drop of about @xmath107  mev induced by the t hooft interaction .",
    "this is not sufficient to populate any strange quark states at the given chemical potential , and the system mainly consists of up and down quarks together with a small fraction of electrons , see fig .",
    "[ denst0log ] .",
    "the electric charge chemical potential which is needed to maintain neutrality in this regime is between about @xmath108 and @xmath109  mev .",
    "it turns out that the resulting splitting of the up and down quark fermi momenta is too large for the given diquark coupling strength to enable diquark pairing and the system stays in the normal phase .    at @xmath110 ,",
    "the chemical potential felt by the strange quarks , @xmath111 , reaches the strange quark mass and the density of strange quarks becomes nonzero . at first , this density is too small to play a sizeable role in neutralizing matter , or in enabling strange - nonstrange cross - flavor diquark pairing , see fig .",
    "[ denst0log ] .",
    "the nq phase becomes metastable against the gapless cfl ( gcfl ) phase at @xmath112 .",
    "this is the point of a first - order phase transition .",
    "it is marked by a drop of the strange quark mass by about @xmath113  mev . as a consequence ,",
    "strange quarks become more abundant and pairing gets easier . yet , in the gcfl phase , the strange quark mass is still relatively large , and the standard bcs pairing between strange and light ( i.e. , up and down ) quarks is not possible .",
    "in contrast to the regular cfl phase , the gcfl phase requires a nonzero density of electrons to stay electrically neutral . at @xmath106 ,",
    "therefore , one could use the value of the electron density as a formal order parameter that distinguishes these two phases @xcite .    with increasing the chemical potential further ( still at @xmath106 ) , the strange quark mass decreases and the cross - flavor cooper pairing gets stronger .",
    "thus , the gcfl phase eventually turns into the regular cfl phase at @xmath114 .",
    "the electron density goes to zero at this point , as it should .",
    "this is indicated by the vanishing value of @xmath39 in the cfl phase , see the upper right panel in fig .",
    "[ plot0 - 20 - 40 ] .",
    "we remind that the cfl phase is neutral because of having equal number densities of all three quark flavors , @xmath115 , see fig .",
    "[ denst0log ] and [ denst0log_strong ] .",
    "this equality is enforced by the pairing mechanism , and this is true even when the quark masses are not exactly equal @xcite .",
    "let us mention here that the same njl model at zero temperature was studied previously in ref .",
    "our results agree qualitatively with those of ref .",
    "@xcite only when the quark chemical potential is larger than the critical value for the transition to the cfl phase at @xmath116 .",
    "the appearance of the gcfl phase for @xmath117 was not recognized in ref .",
    "@xcite , however . instead",
    ", it was suggested that there exists a narrow ( about @xmath118 wide ) window of values of the quark chemical potential around @xmath119 in which the 2sc phase is the ground state . by carefully checking the same region , we find that the 2sc phase does not appear there .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pmu0 ] where the pressure of three different solutions is displayed . had we ignored the gcfl solution ( thin solid line ) , the 2sc solution ( dashed line ) would indeed be the most favored one in the interval between @xmath120  mev and @xmath121  mev . after including the gcfl phase in the analysis , this is no longer the case .",
    "now let us turn to the case of nonzero temperature .",
    "one might suggest that this should be analogous to the zero temperature case , except that cooper pairing is somewhat suppressed by thermal effects .",
    "in contrast to this naive expectation , the thermal distributions of quasiparticles together with the local neutrality conditions open qualitatively new possibilities that were absent at @xmath106 . as in the case of the two - flavor model of ref .",
    "@xcite , a moderate thermal smearing of mismatched fermi surfaces could increase the probability of creating zero - momentum cooper pairs without running into a conflict with pauli blocking .",
    "this leads to the appearance of several stable color - superconducting phases that could not exist at zero temperatures .    with increasing the temperature",
    ", the first qualitatively new feature in the phase diagram appears when @xmath122 . in this temperature interval ,",
    "the nq phase is replaced by the usc phase when the quark chemical potential exceeds the critical value of about @xmath123 .",

    "mev , the usc phase is then replaced by the gcfl phase , and the gcfl phase later turns gradually into the ( m)cfl phase .",
    "( in this study , we do not distinguish between the cfl phase and the mcfl phase @xcite . )",
    "note that , in the model at hand , the transition between the usc and the gcfl phase is of second order in the following two temperature intervals : @xmath124 and @xmath125 . on the other hand , it is a first - order transition when @xmath126 . leaving aside its unusual appearance , this is likely to be an  accidental \" property in the model for a given set of parameters .",
    "for a larger value of the diquark coupling , in particular , such a feature does not appear , see fig .",
    "[ phasediagram - strong ] .",
    "the transition from the gcfl to the cfl phase is a smooth crossover at all @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the electron density is not a good order parameter that could be used to distinguish the gcfl from the cfl phase when the temperature is nonzero .",
    "this is also confirmed by our numerical results for the electric charge chemical potential @xmath39 in fig .",
    "[ plot0 - 20 - 40 ] .",

    "another new feature in the phase diagram appears when the temperature is above about @xmath128 . in this case , with increasing the quark chemical potential , the cooper instability happens immediately after the @xmath101sb phase .",
    "the corresponding critical value of the quark chemical potential is rather low , about @xmath129 .",
    "the first color superconducting phase is the gapless 2sc ( g2sc ) phase @xcite .",
    "this phase is replaced with the 2sc phase in a crossover transition only when @xmath130 .",
    "the 2sc is then followed by the gapless usc ( gusc ) phase , by the usc phase , by the gcfl phase and , eventually , by the cfl phase ( see fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] ) .    in the njl model at hand , determined by the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ model - parameters ] ) , we do not find the dsc phase as the ground state anywhere in the phase diagram .",
    "this is similar to the conclusion of refs .",
    "@xcite , but differs from that of refs",
    ".  @xcite . this should not be surprising because , as was noted earlier @xcite , the appearence of the dsc phase is rather sensitive to a specific choice of parameters in the njl model .",
    "the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] has a very specific ordering of quark phases .",
    "one might ask if this ordering is robust against the modification of the parameters of the model at hand . below",
    "we argue that some features are indeed quite robust , while others are not .",
    "it should be clear that the appearance of color - superconducting phases under the stress of neutrality constraints is very sensitive to the strength of diquark coupling . in the case of two - flavor",
    "quark matter , this was demonstrated very clearly in ref .",

    "the corresponding results are summarized in the diagram in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram - strong ] . as we see , the main qualitative difference between the diagrams in figs .",
    "[ phasediagram ] and [ phasediagram - strong ] occurs at intermediate values of the quark chemical potential . while at @xmath132 , there is a large region of the g2sc phase sandwiched between the low - temperature and high - temperature nq phases , this is not the case at stronger coupling , @xmath131 .",
    "the last observation can easily be explained by the fact that with increasing diquark coupling strength , the condensation energy also increases and therefore cooper pairing is favorable , even if there is a larger mismatch of the fermi surfaces due to charge neutrality constraints .",
    "moreover , in the presence of large gaps , the fermi surfaces are smeared over a region of order @xmath133 .",
    "therefore additional thermal smearing is of no further help , and it is not surprising that the thermal effects in a model with sufficiently strong coupling are qualitatively the same as in models without neutrality constraints imposed : thermal fluctuations can only destroy the pairing . in the model with a not very strong coupling , on the other hand ,",
    "the interplay of the charge neutrality and thermal fluctuations is more subtle . the normal phase of cold quark matter develops a cooper instability and becomes a color superconductor only after a moderate thermal smearing of the quark fermi surfaces is introduced @xcite .",
    "other than this , the qualitative features of the phase diagrams in figs .",
    "[ phasediagram ] and [ phasediagram - strong ] are similar .",
    "of course , in the case of the stronger coupling , the critical lines lie systematically at higher values of the temperature and at lower values of the quark chemical potential . in this context",
    "one should note that the first - order phase boundary between the two normal regimes `` @xmath101sb '' and `` nq '' is insensitive to the diquark coupling .",
    "therefore , upon increasing @xmath28 it stays at its place until it is eventually `` eaten '' up by the expanding 2sc phase . as a result , there is no longer a critical endpoint in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram - strong ] , but only a critical point where the first - order normal(@xmath101sb)-2sc phase boundary changes into second order .",
    "in this paper , we studied the @xmath4@xmath5 phase diagram of neutral three - flavor quark matter within the njl model of ref .",
    "@xcite in which the chiral symmetry is broken explicitly by small but nonzero current quark masses . as in the previous studies",
    "@xcite , we use the mean - field approximation in the analysis .",
    "in contrast to refs .",
    "@xcite , in this paper the constituent quark masses are treated self - consistently as dynamically generated quantities .",
    "the main results are summarized in figs .",
    "[ phasediagram ] and [ phasediagram - strong ] .    by comparing our results with those in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see fig .",
    "11b there ) , we notice several important differences .",
    "first of all , we observe that a self - consistent treatment of quark masses strongly influences the competition between different quark phases . as was noticed earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite , there exists a subtle interplay between the two main effects . on the one hand ,",
    "the actual values of the quark masses directly influence the competition between different normal and color - superconducting phases .",
    "on the other hand , competing phases themselves determine the magnitude of the masses .",
    "very often , this leads to first - order phase transitions , in which certain regions in the mass - parameter space become inaccessible .    some differences to the results in ref .",
    "@xcite are related to a different choice of model parameters .",
    "most importantly , the value of the diquark coupling @xmath30 is considerably weaker than in the njl model of ref .",
    "this can be easily seen by comparing the magnitude of the zero - temperature gap at a given value of the quark chemical potential , say at @xmath134 , in the two models .",
    "it is @xmath135 in this paper , and it is @xmath136 in ref .",
    "( note that the strength of the diquark pairing in ref .",
    "@xcite is even weaker , corresponding to @xmath137 . )",
    "it should be noted that even the case of the strong coupling , @xmath31 , which corresponds to @xmath138 , is still slightly weaker than that in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case , however , the corresponding results differ mostly because the quark masses are treated very differently .    because of the weaker diquark coupling strength , the cooper instabilities in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] happen systematically at higher values of the quark chemical potential than in ref .",
    "in particular , this is most clearly seen from the critical lines of the transition to the ( g)cfl phase .",
    "another consequence of the weaker interaction is the possibility of a thermal enhancement of the ( g)2sc cooper pairing at intermediate values of the quark chemical potential .",
    "this kind of enhancement was studied in detail in ref .",
    "making use of the same arguments , one can tell immediately how the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] should change with increasing or decreasing the diquark coupling strength .",
    "in particular , with increasing ( decreasing ) the diquark coupling strength , the region of the ( g)2sc phase at intermediate values of the quark chemical potential should expand ( shrink ) along the temperature direction .",
    "the regions covered by the other ( i.e. , usc and cfl ) phases should have qualitatively the same shape , but shift to lower ( higher ) values of the quark chemical potential and to higher ( lower ) values of the temperature . in the case of strong coupling , in particular , these general arguments are confirmed by our numerical calculations .",
    "the corresponding phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram - strong ] .",
    "several comments are in order regarding the choice of the njl model used here .",
    "the model is defined by the set of parameters in eq .",
    "( [ model - parameters ] ) which were fitted to reproduce several important qcd properties in vacuum @xcite .",
    "( note that the same model was also used in ref .",
    "it is expected , therefore , that this is a reasonable effective model of qcd that captures the main features of both chiral and color - superconducting pairing dynamics .",
    "also , a relatively small value of the cutoff parameter in the model , see eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) , should not necessarily be viewed as a bad feature of the model .",
    "in fact , this might simply mimic a natural property of the full theory in which the coupling strength of relevant interactions is quenched at large momenta .",
    "in this relation , note that the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite regarding the cutoff parameter in the njl model is very different .",
    "it is said there that a large value of this parameter is beneficial in order to extract results which are insensitive to a specific choice of the cutoff .",
    "however , we do not find any physical argument that would support this requirement .",
    "instead , we insist on having an effective model that describes reasonably well the qcd properties at zero quark chemical potential .",
    "we do not pretend , of course , that a naive extrapolation of the model to large densities can be rigorously justified . in absence of a better alternative",
    ", however , this seems to be the only sensible choice .",
    "the results of this paper might be relevant for understanding the physics of ( hybrid ) neutron stars with quark cores , in which the deleptonization is completed . in order to obtain a phase diagram that could be applied to protoneutron stars",
    ", one has to generalize the analysis to take into account neutrino trapping .",
    "this work is in progress now @xcite .    in the end",
    ", it might be appropriate to mention that , despite the progress in our understanding of the phase diagram of neutral dense quark matter , there still exists a fundamental problem here .",
    "the reason is that some regions of the phase diagrams in figs .",
    "[ phasediagram ] and [ phasediagram - strong ] correspond to phases that are known to be unstable @xcite .",
    "of course , it is of prime importance to resolve this issue .    _ note added . _ while writing our paper , we learned that a partially overlapping study is being done by d.  blaschke , s.  fredriksson , h.  grigorian , a.m.  zta , and f.  sandin @xcite .",
