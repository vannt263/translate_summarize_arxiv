    "very high energy ` cosmic ' neutrinos with energies in excess of about 10  tev offer a unique source of valuable information about energetic events far away in the universe ; see , for example , the reviews in refs .",
    "this has led to the development of neutrino telescopes , which use photo - multiplier tubes to detect the cerenkov radiation emitted from the charged leptons produced in charged - current neutrino interactions in a large volume of water or ice , deep underground ; see , for example , the reviews in refs .  @xcite . if we consider muon neutrinos , then up to about 100  tev the spectrum",
    "is dominated by atmospheric neutrinos from the decays of pions or kaons produced by cosmic ray interactions in the earth s atmosphere . at higher energies",
    "the increased lifetime of these mesons means that they interact before they have the opportunity to decay . above 500  tev",
    "the decays of the much shorter - lived charmed particles become the dominant source of atmospheric muon neutrinos .",
    "these are known as ` prompt ' neutrinos .",
    "their energy dependence follows the original cosmic ray spectrum , while the spectrum of ` conventional ' atmospheric neutrinos falls off by an extra power of the energy because of the competition between the decay and interaction of the parent meson .",
    "it is clearly essential to quantify the flux of ` prompt ' neutrinos as accurately as possible , since they provide the background to the sought - after ` cosmic ' neutrinos .",
    "there exist many models of the ` prompt ' neutrino flux in the relevant @xmath14@xmath15  gev energy range , which yield predictions which differ by more than two orders of magnitude",
    ". some of the models are purely phenomenological and have arbitrary continuation to high energy from the domain constrained by accelerator data .",
    "however , it has been noted that , with the inclusion of the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) contributions  @xcite , perturbative qcd gives a satisfactory description of the observed features of the available accelerator data on charm production , see for example  @xcite@xcite .",
    "moreover , the simplified lo calculation reproduces the same behaviour when multiplied by an overall @xmath16 factor , @xmath17 , to account for the nlo contribution .",
    "several authors have therefore used perturbative qcd to predict the prompt neutrino flux  @xcite@xcite .    the perturbative approach , however , faces the same problem of extrapolation to high energies .",
    "the lo diagram for forward high energy charm production is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the cross section may be written in terms of the feynman variable @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the longitudinal momentum of the charm quark ; at high energies @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the incident proton energy and @xmath22 is the energy of the charm quark . using the notation of fig .  1",
    ", we have @xmath23 where @xmath24 with @xmath25 , and where @xmath26 is the gluon density of the proton .",
    "the mandelstam variables @xmath27 and @xmath28 refer to the @xmath29 subprocess .",
    "gev , following ref .",
    "we know that this value , taken together with the nlo contribution ( @xmath30 ) , gives a good description of all the available fixed - target data for @xmath6 , or rather d meson , production ( which are in the region @xmath31  gev )  @xcite . ]",
    "the problem is that in the high energy domain of interest we sample the gluon density at very small @xmath32 ; to be specific @xmath33@xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the total @xmath36 c.m .",
    "there are no data which determine the gluon for @xmath37 , and , as a rule , parton distributions for @xmath38 are not available .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite shows a range of predictions for the prompt flux neutrino obtained by continuing the gluon distribution below @xmath39 using the power law dependence @xmath40 with @xmath41 in the range 00.5 .",
    "of course , the prediction depends crucially on the value taken for @xmath41 , and at the highest neutrino energy shown , @xmath15  gev , the rates span about two orders of magnitude .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to diminish the uncertainty in the predictions of the prompt neutrino flux .",
    "the major problem is to obtain the most reliable method of extrapolation based on the present understanding of the small @xmath0 regime . in order to do this",
    "we begin , in section  [ sec : gluonatsmallx ] , by comparing different physically - motivated extrapolations of the gluon to very small @xmath0 :    * dglap gluon with a double leading log ( dll ) extrapolation , * unified dglap / bfkl gluon @xcite with @xmath42 extrapolation , * extrapolation with saturation effects included .    in section  [ sec : predictions ] we compare the predictions for the @xmath43 distribution of charm quarks produced in high energy @xmath36 collisions ( @xmath44 to @xmath15  gev ) using the three models for extrapolating the gluon into the small @xmath0 regime , typically @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "we argue that the extrapolation based on model  ( iii ) is the most reliable , and so for the remainder of the paper we show results for this gluon . to determine the prompt neutrino flux we need to extend the calculation to high energy proton  air collisions .",
    "this is done in section  [ sec : ccbarproduction ] , where we also consider the uncertainties associated with the extrapolation based on model  ( iii ) .    in section  [ sec : promptneutrinos ]",
    "we describe the formalism that we shall use to calculate the prompt lepton spectra . starting from the production of @xmath6 pairs from the incoming cosmic ray flux , we allow for their fragmentation into charmed ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) hadrons , and for their subsequent",
    "semileptonic decays .",
    "we include the effects of the lifetime of the charmed hadrons and , also , for the lifetime and decay modes of the @xmath51 lepton in the @xmath52 decays .",
    "the results of the calculation of the prompt @xmath1 and @xmath2 fluxes are presented in section  [ sec : promptnufluxes ] , and compared with the ` conventional ' atmospheric fluxes .",
    "these latter fluxes arise from @xmath53 , @xmath54 decays and @xmath55 oscillations respectively .",
    "we find that the prompt @xmath2 spectrum for @xmath56  gev lies much above its conventional atmospheric background , whereas for the prompt @xmath1 spectrum this is only achieved for @xmath57  gev .",
    "the origins of the prompt @xmath2 flux are the @xmath52 decays which occur with a branching fraction of @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "it is relevant to note that high energy @xmath2 s , unlike @xmath1 s , are not depleted in number by absorption in the earth .",
    "they will always penetrate the earth due to the @xmath59 regeneration sequence  @xcite .",
    "this is clearly crucial for upgoing high energy neutrinos through the earth and can be important for horizontal neutrinos ( particularly of high energy ) entering a detector deep underground .    at first sight",
    ", it appears that the prompt neutrino flux from @xmath4 production will , relative to the flux of @xmath6 origin , be suppressed , first , by a factor of order @xmath60 and , second , by the fact that the gluon is sampled at larger @xmath0 . however , for the prompt @xmath2 flux of @xmath4 origin , the suppression is partly compensated by the existence of significant @xmath61 semileptonic decays of all the beauty hadrons ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) , in contrast to just the @xmath52 decays for charm .",
    "we calculate the prompt flux arising from @xmath4 production , fragmentation and decay in section  [ sec : prompt ] . finally ,",
    "in the concluding section , we discuss the implications of our results for neutrino astronomy and cosmic ray physics .",
    "also , there , we summarize the uncertainties in the predictions of the prompt neutrino fluxes .",
    "as mentioned above , one possible method of extrapolating the gluon into the @xmath38 regime is to resum the leading @xmath66 terms within the dglap framework , which leads to a small @xmath0 behaviour in the form @xmath67 where the lo coupling @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we take @xmath71  gev@xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we use mrst2001 partons  @xcite with @xmath74  mev .",
    "the reliability of this form of dll extrapolation has been checked using grv partons  @xcite which are tabulated down to @xmath75 . ]",
    "@xmath76 we denote this extrapolation by mrst on the figures below .    as far as we fix the scale @xmath77 and extrapolate to much smaller @xmath0 , the leading contribution comes from @xmath78 terms , which , at leading order , are resummed by the bfkl equation  @xcite .",
    "therefore a more reliable extrapolation is obtained by solving a unified dglap / bfkl equation  @xcite for the gluon .",
    "this equation is written in terms of the gluon , unintegrated over its transverse momentum , which should be used with the off - mass shell ) @xmath79 with @xmath80 ; where @xmath81 is the unintegrated gluon density as defined in @xcite , and where @xmath82 are the @xmath83 cross sections with the small @xmath0 gluon on- , off - mass - shell .",
    "the large @xmath84 gluon , which is clearly in the dglap regime , is always taken to be on - mass - shell . ]",
    "matrix element for the hard @xmath83 subprocess amplitude  @xcite . in this way",
    "the result embodies the main part of the nlo dglap correction . besides this",
    ", the unified equation includes a kinematic constraint ( or consistency condition )  @xcite which accounts for the major part of the higher - order corrections to the bfkl evolution .",
    "indeed , the power behaviour generated corresponds to @xmath85 which is much less than the lo bfkl behaviour @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "moreover , the charm production cross section @xmath88 calculated in terms of the kms unintegrated gluons  @xcite is found to coincide , within 10% accuracy , with the prediction obtained with conventional dglap gluons  @xcite for @xmath14@xmath89  gev laboratory energies , corresponding to @xmath90@xmath34 for which deep inelastic accelerator data exist .",
    "note that , in this comparison , the prediction based on conventional partons was calculated at lo and multiplied by @xmath91 , which , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , accounts well for the nlo corrections .",
    "on the other hand the unified dglap / bfkl prescription already incorporates the main nlo effect at small @xmath0 , and so no @xmath16 factor is present in this @xmath0 domain .",
    "we denote the results obtained using this gluon by kms on the figures below .    at @xmath89",
    "gev these predictions should be reliable .",
    "however , as we proceed to higher energies , we sample gluons in smaller and smaller @xmath0 regimes with increasing gluon density , and so we must account for the effect of saturation . to study this effect",
    "we start with the golec - biernat ,  wsthoff  ( gbw ) model of deep inelastic scattering ( dis )  @xcite ( and diffractive dis  @xcite ) .",
    "let us outline the basis of the model , as applied to @xmath92 production in dis .",
    "the production of @xmath92 pairs is described by the probability of the formation of the pair by the initial photon multiplied by the cross section for the @xmath92proton interaction , @xmath93 .",
    "the first stage is given by the effective photon wave functions @xmath94 ( for transverse , longitudinal polarisations ) , which depend on the momentum fraction @xmath95 carried by the quark and the transverse separation @xmath96 between the @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the deep inelastic cross sections have the form  @xcite @xmath99 for small @xmath100 , the dipole cross section @xmath93 is proportional to @xmath101 . to allow for multiple interactions , golec - biernat and wsthoff  @xcite parameterize @xmath93 by the form @xmath102 with an @xmath0-dependent saturation radius @xmath103",
    "the parameterization is a simplified version of the well - known glauber expression for , say , describing the multiple interactions of a pion passing through a nucleus @xmath104 .",
    "\\label{eq : sigma_pia}\\ ] ] the integral @xmath105 gives the nuclear area @xmath106 , which is replaced by @xmath107 in ( [ eq : sigmahat ] ) , and the mean nucleon density @xmath108 is parameterized by @xmath109 , modulo normalisation .",
    "@xmath110 is the @xmath53nucleon cross section , which is equivalent to the @xmath92-dipole cross section in the gbw  model .",
    "that is , the exponent @xmath111 in ( [ eq : sigma_pia ] ) is equivalent to @xmath112 , where the gluon density @xmath113 plays the role of the mean nucleon density @xmath108 , and where the factor in brackets plays the role of @xmath110 .",
    "it is because the gluon density grows as @xmath0 decreases that we have an @xmath0 dependence in the argument of the exponential in ( [ eq : sigmahat ] ) .",
    "the gbw model has recently been realised  @xcite in terms of the gluon density , including the dglap @xmath114 evolution of @xmath115 .",
    "actually in this improved form it should be considered , not as a model , but as a complete perturbative calculation , which in addition to the conventional lo collinear approach also accounts for the rescattering of the incoming @xmath92 pair .",
    "the power of @xmath0 in ( [ eq : r_0 ] ) reflects the power growth of the gluon density in the small @xmath0 region .",
    "the parameters @xmath116 and @xmath41 were fitted to describe the small @xmath0 dis data  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , up to @xmath117  gev@xmath72 , a good description can be achieved , even without accounting for dglap evolution .",
    "interestingly , the value of the power , @xmath118 , turns out to be close to the value found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "so far we have considered absorption for dis .",
    "here we are interested in @xmath83 , and not @xmath119 .",
    "it is therefore necessary to multiply the @xmath119 cross section by [ eq : multiplicationfactor ] where the first factor is due to colour , and the second term in square brackets accounts for @xmath120 production ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "note that the approach of golec - biernat and wsthoff includes only the rescattering of the @xmath6 pair and neglects the enhanced reggeon diagrams which account for the rescattering of the more complicated fock components of the photon ( gluon ) like @xmath121 , @xmath122 , etc .",
    "these extra components have a larger absorptive cross section .",
    "in other words , when the gluon density becomes sufficiently large , we must allow for @xmath123 recombination , which diminishes the rate of @xmath6 production . from this @xmath124 channel viewpoint",
    ", the absorption is driven by the triple - pomeron interaction . with the help of the balitskii ",
    "kovchegov equation  @xcite , we may sum up the resulting fan diagrams ( formed from different networks of pomeron  pomeron recombinations into single pomeron exchanges ) .",
    "this effect has been studied numerically in recent papers  @xcite .",
    "however , the approach is based on lo  bfkl , and does not account for the nlo corrections , which are known to be large . in this case",
    "we can not simply rescale the lo prediction by taking a lower pomeron intercept ,  @xmath125 .",
    "the problem is that the triple - pomeron vertex is not known at nlo .",
    "there are reasons , both from phenomenology  @xcite and from perturbative evolution  @xcite , to believe that the triple - pomeron coupling is small . nevertheless , at very high energy",
    ", we expect the resulting absorption to be stronger . from this point of view",
    "we may regard the prediction based on the gbw model as the upper limit for @xmath6 production .",
    "later , for a more realistic estimate of the cross section for @xmath6 production , we take account of the triple - pomeron vertex by replacing  ( [ eq : r_0 ] ) by .",
    "thus , contrary to the eikonal form , where we have @xmath126 , here we deal with a geometrical series type of expression @xmath127 .",
    "therefore we choose form  ( [ eq : r_0 ^ 2 ] ) with the constant @xmath5 as evaluated in @xcite . ]",
    "[ eq : r_0 ^ 2 ] r_0 ^ 2  = ( c+(x / x_0)^ ) for @xmath128 with @xmath129@xmath130 .",
    "this is to protect @xmath131 becoming too small for small @xmath0 .",
    "the only reason why the above upper limit may be exceeded arises because the gbw saturation model @xcite was formulated at fixed impact parameter , and so does not allow for the growth of the proton radius @xmath132 with increasing energy .",
    "the radius @xmath132 can be determined from the slope @xmath133 of the elastic @xmath36 cross section , [ eq : b ] b = b_0 + 2^e , where @xmath134 is the slope of the pomeron trajectory , and @xmath21 is the proton energy in the laboratory frame .",
    "indeed , for a large - size dipole the gbw model saturates at @xmath135  mb , whereas the normal soft hadronic cross sections , which should be equivalent to large - size dipoles , continue to grow logarithmically with energy . from a physical point of view",
    ", the normalisation @xmath107 in ( [ eq : sigmahat ] ) is related to the proton area @xmath136 .",
    "of course , we only have the inequality @xmath137 , since charm production originates mainly from the centre of the proton .",
    "however , since @xmath136 grows with energy , a conservative _ upper limit _ is obtained by multiplying the prediction obtained from the gbw model by the factor @xmath138 , with @xmath139  gev , typical of the hera domain where the parameters of the model were tuned .    a _ lower limit _ to @xmath6 production",
    "may be obtained if we assume a scaling behaviour for @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the total inelastic @xmath36 cross section  that is if we assume that @xmath142 is independent of energy .",
    "hence the lower limit is @xmath143 normalised in the region @xmath44  gev ( @xmath45 ) where the parton distributions are known . to be more precise",
    "we should replace @xmath141 in ( [ eq : lowerlimit ] ) by the cross section corresponding to the fock component of the proton wave function which contains charm .",
    "however , the cross section for this component will grow with energy faster than @xmath141 , and thus ( [ eq : lowerlimit ] ) may be regarded as an extreme lower limit for the charm yield .",
    "we consider the fock charm component to be generated perturbatively . in principle",
    ", it would be possible to have also a non - perturbative ` intrinsic ' charm component  @xcite , although there is no firm experimental evidence for its existence .",
    "such an intrinsic charm cross section would originate from the non - perturbative large - size domain , controlled by @xmath141 , and hence its contribution would become less important , with increasing energy , than the perturbative cross section .",
    "in fig .  2 we compare the predictions for the @xmath43 distribution of charm quarks produced in @xmath36 collisions , as given by the three models for extrapolating the gluon ) are evaluated at a scale @xmath144 equal to the transverse mass of the charm quark for the mrst and kms models ; that is @xmath145 . for the gbw extrapolation",
    "we take @xmath146 , where @xmath100 is the separation between the @xmath5 and @xmath147 quarks . ] to small @xmath0 . for laboratory energies",
    "@xmath148@xmath89  gev we sample the gluons in the @xmath0 region @xmath149@xmath34 where the parton distributions are known from global analyses .",
    "hence , since each model reproduces the same data , they give essentially the same predictions for @xmath6 production .",
    "recall that the lo dglap result , based on mrst partons , was multiplied by a @xmath16 factor of 2.3 .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that such a constant @xmath16 factor reproduces well the nlo perturbative qcd prediction and gives a good description of the available fixed - target data for @xmath6 , or rather @xmath150 meson , production for @xmath31  gev .",
    "recall that , following  @xcite , we take the mass of the charm quark to be @xmath151 .",
    "although we use a constant @xmath16 factor , @xmath91 , we have confirmed that the use of the parameterization of the @xmath16 factor , @xmath152 , given in eq .",
    "( 3.4 ) of  @xcite , does not appreciably alter any predictions .    up to @xmath153  gev",
    ", the gbw saturation model practically coincides with the dglap ( mrst ) prediction . for higher energies",
    "the gbw cross section is lower due to absorptive effects . on the contrary ,",
    "the prediction based on kms partons becomes higher , as well as lower at the lower energies .",
    "the ` unified ' kms evolution includes the bfkl @xmath154 resummation and generates a power growth , @xmath42 , of the gluon density as we extrapolate to small @xmath0 .",
    "this evolution embodies a kinematic constraint ( or consistency condition ) which accounts for a major part of the nlo and higher - order bfkl effects .",
    "however , the power , @xmath155 , is appreciable , and the growth exceeds the double logarithmic dglap growth of the mrst result . another feature to note is that the shape of the @xmath43 distribution becomes a little steeper with increasing energy , as seen in fig .",
    "2(d ) , which shows the predictions of the gbw extrapolation for three different energies .",
    "on the other hand , at low energies , we see from fig .  3 that the kms prediction falls away .",
    "indeed , it is about a factor of two below the gbw / mrst predictions for @xmath156  gev . here , we are sampling the gluon at @xmath0 values above 0.01 , where the @xmath154 resummation is not effective and where lo dglap evolution takes over .",
    "to put it another way , it was observed in the kms unified bfkl / dglap approach  @xcite , that the cross section for an off - shell gluon is enhanced by @xmath154 effects for @xmath157 , whereas it rapidly tends to the lo on - shell dglap formula as @xmath0 increases above this value .",
    "hence in the low energy regime a factor @xmath158 should be included in the kms prediction , with the factor dying away with increasing energy , as we enter the bfkl regime .    a convenient way to summarize",
    "the relevant energy behaviour of the @xmath159 cross section is to plot the ` @xmath160 moment ' @xcite of the @xmath43 distribution , see for example  @xcite .",
    "for high energies ( @xmath57  gev ) the incoming primary cosmic ray flux falls down as @xmath161 with @xmath162 .",
    "therefore the charm flux is proportional to the moment [ eq : momentz_c ] z_c  x^2.02dx .",
    "this moment is shown in fig .  3 ,    where the difference between the saturation model and the other two models becomes apparent for @xmath163  gev .",
    "note that here we fix the energy @xmath22 of the outgoing @xmath5 quark , rather than that of the incident proton which was used in fig .",
    "although the gbw model predicts the smallest cross section of the three models , it should be considered as the _ upper limit _ ) . ] for @xmath6 production as it only accounts for part of the absorptive effects . for the reasons mentioned earlier , the gbw model is more than a model  rather it should be regarded as a full leading - order qcd prediction with @xmath6 rescattering effects included .",
    "of course there is , in addition , absorption of the gluons in the evolution process .",
    "it appears likely that the consequent reduction of the @xmath6 cross section due to this additional absorption may be partially compensated by the growth of the proton radius with increasing energy .",
    "we investigate this , and other effects , in the next section ; see fig .  4 later .",
    "therefore , from now on , we will base our study on the gbw approach and its variations .",
    "for a precise study we need the charm yield in @xmath164-nuclear ( air ) collisions .",
    "an advantage of the gbw saturation model is that it may be straightforwardly extended from @xmath36 to @xmath164-nuclear collisions . within the gbw framework",
    "we may account for the eikonal rescattering of the @xmath6 pair within the nucleus by replacing @xmath93 in  ( [ eq : sigmahat ] ) by [ eq : asigmahatsum ] a_n=1^ where , for air , the mean atomic number @xmath165 and the slope @xmath166 .",
    "note that in the numerator we have @xmath167 and not @xmath168 . in this way we exclude rescattering on the nucleon where the @xmath6 pair is created .",
    "this rescattering is controlled by a different slope ( @xmath169 ) , and is already accounted for in the cross section given in ( [ eq : sigmahat ] ) .",
    "we have taken the root - mean - square nuclear radius dependence . ]",
    "@xmath170  fm , and assumed a gaussian distribution of the nucleon density for light nuclei .",
    "note that the replacement of @xmath93 occurs before the integration over the @xmath5@xmath171 separation in ( [ eq : sigma_t , l ] ) . in summary , the inclusive @xmath6",
    "cross section for proton  air interactions is given by the sum of proton  nucleon cross sections , with the only nuclear effect being the enhanced absorption of the produced @xmath6 pair . in the appendix",
    "we give a simple parameterization which reproduces the proton ",
    "air @xmath6 production cross section in the energy interval @xmath172 to within @xmath173 .",
    "the @xmath162 moment of charm production in high energy proton ",
    "air collisions is shown in fig .",
    "the dashed curve is the prediction of the extrapolation based on the original gbw saturation model , while the upper dotted curve ( marked by @xmath133 ) includes the possible effect of the growth of the proton radius with energy , as discussed at the end of section  [ sec : gluonatsmallx ] , see in particular ( [ eq : b ] ) .",
    "instead of using the pomeron slope , @xmath174 , measured in elastic @xmath36 scattering , in ( [ eq : b ] ) we use the value @xmath175 together with slope @xmath176 at @xmath177 , which were deduced from elastic @xmath178 production data at hera  @xcite .",
    "these values are appropriate for charm production .",
    "the lower dotted line ( marked @xmath179 ) reflects the inclusion of an additional absorptive effect  the absorption of gluons .",
    "we take @xmath180 in ( [ eq : r_0 ^ 2 ] ) , which corresponds to the largest estimate .",
    "however , the _ bare _ triple - pomeron vertex may be a few times larger , since the phenomenological value already accounts for some screening effects .",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that in perturbative qcd we expect @xmath181@xmath182 . ] , @xmath183 , of the triple - pomeron vertex .",
    "this choice is made to show the full extent of the uncertainty in @xmath6 production . if both the above effects are included ( the radius growth and @xmath179 ) , then the solid curve ( marked @xmath184 ) is obtained .",
    "conservatively , we predict that @xmath185 will lie within the shaded region in fig .  4 ; the most likely behaviour is that it will follow the cross - hatched region .",
    "even the conservative prediction has much less uncertainty than previous estimates .",
    "however , for completeness , the dot - dashed curve shows the extreme lower limit , given by scaling formula ( [ eq : lowerlimit ] ) , but where now @xmath141 is the proton  air cross section .",
    "all the variations of the original gbw model were normalized in the region @xmath186 , where the partons sampled in the hard subprocess are known , and the model tuned to the data .",
    "our aim is to predict the spectra of _ prompt _ @xmath1 and @xmath2 neutrinos produced in the atmosphere by cosmic rays .",
    "prompt leptons originate from the following sequence : the production of @xmath6 pairs , their fragmentation into charm hadrons which then undergo semi - leptonic decay . in the lower energy range ( @xmath187 )",
    "it is possible to estimate the leptonic spectra by simply taking a product of moments of the various distributions , see , for example , ref .",
    "however , for @xmath188 the decay length of @xmath150 mesons becomes comparable with the depth of the atmosphere , and so it is necessary to follow the development of the air shower in more detail .",
    "it is described by a set of equations in terms of the ` depth ' @xmath189 of the atmosphere transversed by a particle in the vertical direction .",
    "@xmath189 is related to the height @xmath190 by [ eq : x ] x=_h^(h)dh where @xmath191 is the density of the atmosphere at vertical height @xmath190 .",
    "we take the same exponential profile of the atmosphere as was used in ref .",
    "the sequence of equations determine @xmath192 , which are the fluxes of the corresponding particles with energy @xmath21 at depth @xmath189 , where @xmath193 ( that is nucleon , @xmath5  quark , charmed hadron , lepton ) .",

    "it is important to renormalise the yield using the updated branching ratio .",

    "6 we plot the prompt @xmath1 and @xmath2 fluxes predicted by the three models for the extrapolation of the gluon distribution to very small @xmath0 .",
    "although in figs .  3 and 4 we compared different models of extrapolation using a fixed @xmath162 , in the actual calculation of the neutrino fluxes we used the observed primary cosmic ray flux , which corresponds to different values of @xmath268 above and below the ` knee ' .",
    "the sharp fall - off for neutrino energies @xmath269 is due to the increase in the decay length of the charmed hadrons , arising from lorentz time dilation .",

    "7 we also show the conventional atmospheric flux of @xmath1 ( from @xmath53 and @xmath16 decays , etc . ) .",
    "moreover , there is a small probability that atmospheric @xmath1 neutrinos may oscillate into @xmath2 neutrinos and so provide an ` atmospheric ' @xmath2 flux .",
    "we calculate this flux using the @xmath272 ranges of the @xmath273 and @xmath274 neutrino mixing parameters found in an analysis  @xcite of the super - kamiokande  @xcite and macro  @xcite data .",
    "the resulting atmospheric @xmath2 flux is shown by a band in the lower plot of fig .",
    "we discuss the neutrino fluxes of fig .  7 in the concluding section , after we have included the contribution to the prompt @xmath2 spectrum arising from @xmath4 production , fragmentation and decay .",
    "however , first , we show in fig .  8 the effect of charmed hadron interactions with the atmosphere .",
    "the effect is illustrated by the difference between the dashed curve , for which the interactions are suppressed ( that is @xmath275 ) , and the continuous curve with the interactions present .",
    "for this comparison we use the gbw extrapolation , the one given by the solid curve in fig .  4 .",
    "we emphasize that the predictions for the prompt neutrino fluxes depend strongly on the nuclear content of the primary cosmic rays .",
    "so far we have assumed that the cosmic rays are composed entirely of protons .",
    "suppose that the protons were to be replaced by nuclei of the same energy @xmath21 and of atomic number @xmath168 .",
    "then we have to scale the energy of the primary interacting nucleon to @xmath276 . roughly speaking ,",
    "this reduces the neutrino flux @xmath277 in the plateau region ( @xmath278@xmath279 ) of the @xmath280 plot by @xmath281 . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of incoming nucleons is @xmath168 , so as a consequence we expect an @xmath282 suppression .",
    "a detailed calculation for incoming nuclei with @xmath283  @xcite gives the dotted curve in fig",
    "the suppression of the original gbw continuous curve ( for @xmath284 ) is apparent .",
    "at first sight it appears that if we also allow for @xmath4 production , with the same cross section , fragmentation and decay then we will approximately double the @xmath2 flux .",
    "however note that , in comparison with charm production , the cross section for beauty production is about 30 times smaller due to the factor @xmath60 and to the larger value of @xmath32 of the gluon structure function which is sampled , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsigmabydx_f ] ) , see fig .",
    "9 . nevertheless , the high energy production of @xmath2 neutrinos from beauty decays is not negligible .    for charm ,",
    "only the decay of the @xmath49 may produce @xmath2 neutrinos , whereas now @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 semileptonic decays also give rise to a significant @xmath2 flux . indeed including @xmath133 and @xmath65",
    "decays enlarges the predicted total prompt @xmath2 flux by about 40% for @xmath285 , and even more at higher energies , see fig .",
    "this is considerably larger than the @xmath286 flux calculated in @xcite , where the beauty induced contribution grows from 1% at @xmath287  gev to about 10% at @xmath288  gev . the reasons why we obtain a larger fraction of @xmath2 neutrinos from beauty are , first , that we use ( [ eq : smallersigmaratio ] ) , rather than ( [ eq : charmyields ] ) , for @xmath289 hadronization and , second , our cross section for charm production is more suppressed at high energies by absorptive corrections , than the more compact @xmath4 production process .",
    "10(a ) shows the breakdown of the total prompt @xmath2 flux .",
    "we take the ratios of the @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 beauty yields ( after hadronization of the @xmath237 quark ) to be given by exactly analogous relations to ( [ eq : charmyields ] ) and ( [ eq : smallersigmaratio ] ) for charm . recall that @xmath2 s of @xmath6 and @xmath4 origin come , respectively , from @xmath52 and from the semileptonic @xmath61 decay modes of @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "thus we have a direct @xmath2 component and an indirect component coming from the @xmath290 decays . for charm",
    "the former component is very small since the direct @xmath2 carries away a small energy fraction .",
    "thus the @xmath290 decay gives the dominant component , which is truncated at an energy when the @xmath51 has insufficient time to decay . for beauty",
    "the direct and indirect components are comparable until the energy regime is entered at which the @xmath51 has not enough time to decay .    to calculate the @xmath237 quark cross section we have used the same gbw model as described in sections  24 with a quark mass @xmath291 .",
    "we have approximated the @xmath292 fragmentation function by a delta function at @xmath293 .",
    "also we have assumed that the hadronization and the cross - section of the beauty hadron  air interaction do not depend appreciably on the nature of the heavy quark .",
    "so we have used the same attenuation lengths @xmath222 and the same ratios of the different beauty hadron yields ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : charmyields ] ) and ( [ eq : smallersigmaratio ] ) ) , as were used for the charm case .",
    "we neglect the @xmath4 contribution to the @xmath1 ( and @xmath266 ) fluxes .",
    "they never exceed about 23% of that arising from @xmath6 production and decay .",
    "the @xmath1 flux shown in fig .",
    "7(a ) , and the @xmath2 flux shown in fig .  10(b ) , have important implications for neutrino astronomy .",
    "these neutrino fluxes arise from cosmic ray interactions with the atmosphere .",
    "they therefore provide the background to searches for cosmic neutrinos ( for which there are many exciting new physics scenarios ) .",
    "they also provide a possibility to calibrate the detectors of the new neutrino telescopes .",
    "a particularly interesting energy domain is where the prompt neutrino flux has emerged from the sharply falling ` conventional ' atmospheric neutrino flux . here",
    "@xmath2 appears to have an enormous advantage in searching for a signal for new physics , see figs .  7 and  10 .",
    "due to mixing , the fluxes of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are equal for incoming cosmic neutrinos .",
    "the flux of prompt @xmath2 neutrinos ( which arises mainly from @xmath52 decays , but with a significant 40% contribution from @xmath133 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 semileptonic decays ) is about ten times less than that for prompt @xmath1 , and the number of @xmath2 neutrinos produced from the conventional atmospheric flux ( via @xmath294 oscillations ) is negligible for @xmath295 .",
    "there is only a little time for neutrino mixing in the atmosphere .",
    "thus the tau neutrino flux originating from atmospheric neutrinos is greatly suppressed . as a consequence ,",
    "tau neutrinos offer an ideal means of identifying neutrinos of _ cosmic _ origin , and for searching for new physics .",
    "there is another reason to concentrate on the @xmath2 flux . for values of @xmath296 above @xmath14  gev the @xmath1 flux is significantly depleted in the passage of the neutrinos through the earth .",
    "the absorption increases rapidly as @xmath296 is increased  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "high energy @xmath2 neutrinos have the unique advantage that they are not depleted in number no matter how much of the earth that they pass through .",
    "if they suffer a charged - current interaction , they produce a @xmath51 lepton which subsequently decays , regenerating a @xmath2 neutrino with degraded energy  @xcite .",
    "it is , moreover , interesting to note that tau neutrinos of energies about @xmath297  gev may produce spectacular distinctive signatures in the planned 1  km@xmath298 high energy neutrino detectors made of strings of photomultiplier tubes distributed throughout a naturally occurring cerenkov medium , such as water or ice , deep in the ocean or ice cap .",
    "a charged - current @xmath2 interaction may produce a contained ` double bang ' signature  @xcite or a ` lollipop ' signature  @xcite . in the former , the first bang corresponds to the hadronic shower produced along with the subsequent @xmath51 lepton and the second bang is the shower associated with the @xmath51 decay .",
    "a lollipop event is when only the second shower occurs within the detector and the @xmath51 lepton which initiates the shower is identified by the relatively weak ionization that it causes .",
    "another interesting possibility follows from the observation that electron neutrinos may be distinguished experimentally from muon and tau neutrinos .",
    "electron neutrinos give rise to distinctive showers , which result from their charged - current interactions , which characteristically are contained within the large detector volume , and hence identified .",
    "the conventional atmospheric flux of @xmath266 neutrinos comes mostly from kaon decays and so the relative flux @xmath299  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the prompt @xmath266 and @xmath1 fluxes are practically equal to each other .",
    "hence the prompt @xmath266 flux should be more visible over its conventional background , than the prompt @xmath2 flux .",
    "of course , the background reduction is much less than for @xmath2 neutrinos , but this will be partially offset since it is likely that @xmath266 neutrinos will be easier to identify than @xmath2 neutrinos .",
    "so far we have shown the prompt neutrino fluxes arising from vertically - incident cosmic rays .",
    "however , the predicted fluxes are sensitive to the zenith angle . in particular , as we depart from the vertical incident direction , more atmosphere is encountered , which gives more time for the charmed hadrons to decay and hence allows more high energy neutrinos to be produced .",
    "this is well illustrated by fig .",
    "11 , which shows the prompt neutrino fluxes produced by horizontally - incident cosmic rays .",
    "indeed , for @xmath300 , the flux in the horizontal direction is noticeably larger .",
    "the observation of the zenith angle dependence will allow the ` atmospheric ' background neutrinos to be identified and hence cosmic neutrinos ( and therefore new physics ) to be isolated .",
    "we have emphasized the importance to neutrino astronomy of reliable predictions of the prompt muon and tau neutrino fluxes , which arise from @xmath6 and @xmath4 production , hadronization and decay in the atmosphere .",
    "they provide the background to the search for cosmic neutrinos originating from active galactic nuclei or elsewhere .",
    "we have argued that the predictions based on perturbative qcd , given in figs .",
    "7(a ) and 10(b ) , have much less uncertainty than those that already exist in the literature .",
    "how reliable is perturbative qcd and the extrapolation of the gluon into the very small @xmath0 domain ?",
    "perturbative qcd is expected to be valid for @xmath4 production production , there are no accelerator @xmath4 data in the fragmentation region which is relevant to this study . however , there exist tevatron data for central @xmath4 production with , typically , @xmath301  gev  @xcite which appear to exceed the nlo qcd prediction",
    ". recently it has been shown  @xcite that the discrepancy may be reduced to an acceptable level by using a fragmentation function with @xmath302 larger than that of the conventional peterson et  al .",
    "parameterization  @xcite . ] , and should also hold for @xmath6 production since the factorization scale @xmath303 .",
    "it is important to note that at fixed target energies , @xmath31  gev , the nlo predictions for @xmath88 are in agreement with the available data , while for very high energies the mean scale , @xmath304 , increases due to saturation effects .",
    "since the gluon distribution is determined by hera deep inelastic data down to @xmath305 , predictions , which use partonic structure determined from these data and which agree with fixed target charm data , should be reliable up to about @xmath44  gev , and perhaps an order of magnitude or so above .",
    "3 shows examples of three very different models which illustrate that this is indeed the case .",
    "( recall that in section  [ sec : predictions ] we explained why the kms prediction is not applicable at the lower energies shown in fig .  3 .",
    ") however , as we proceed to higher energies , and sample smaller and smaller @xmath0 values and hence increasing gluon density , we must include the effects of saturation .",
    "though we have labelled the predictions by gbw , we have not simply used the saturation model of golec - biernat and wsthoff , but rather we investigated the uncertainties in including saturation effects in some detail , see fig .",
    "we concluded that the most reliable predictions would be obtained using the continuous curve in fig .  4 , with conservative errors shown by the shaded band , which are reflected in the shaded bands on the prompt neutrino fluxes shown in fig .",
    "these bands represent the uncertainty in @xmath6 production .",
    "in addition , there are also uncertainties associated with the fragmentation of the charm quark ( see fig .  5 ) and with the @xmath150 meson attenuation due to its strong interaction with the atmosphere ( see fig .",
    "another source of uncertainty is the @xmath0 distribution of the @xmath50 hyperons .",
    "the recombination of the @xmath5 quark with the @xmath306 diquark of the incoming proton gives the @xmath50 a rather large @xmath0 .",
    "we use the simplified formula @xmath307 , where a fast diquark with @xmath308 recombines with any @xmath5 quark with @xmath249 .",
    "the relatively large uncertainty arises because the @xmath309 flux is proportional to the @xmath310 moment , ( [ eq : momentz_c ] ) , of the @xmath0 distribution .",
    "thus the larger value of @xmath0 carried by the @xmath50 ( as compared to the @xmath150 mesons ) compensates for the small probability of @xmath50 formation , see ( [ eq : charmyields ] ) . as a consequence , the contribution of the @xmath50 to the prompt @xmath1 flux increases from about 10% to 40% as the neutrino energy increase from @xmath14 to @xmath15  gev .",
    "unfortunately the @xmath0 distribution of @xmath50 hyperons at high energies ( @xmath311  tev ) is not measured yet . however , the @xmath312 moment given by pythia is in agreement with the above prescription , ( [ eq : prescriptiona ] ) , that @xmath255 for @xmath249 .",
    "overall , we see that the uncertainty in the prompt neutrino flux predictions is about a factor of  3 . for the @xmath2 flux from charm , which relies entirely on the @xmath52 decay",
    ", there is also an extra uncertainty associated with the branching ratio and with the production ratio of ( [ eq : smallersigmaratio ] ) .",
    "there is less uncertainty in the @xmath2 flux from beauty , since it originates more uniformly from @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 semileptonic @xmath61 decays .",
    "finally we note that the predictions have been made assuming that the incoming cosmic rays are predominantly composed of protons .",
    "if , however , it should happen that the observed @xmath1 and @xmath2 prompt fluxes lie below the predictions of figs .",
    "7(a ) and 10(b ) , then the measurements may give important constraints on the nuclear composition of cosmic rays .",
