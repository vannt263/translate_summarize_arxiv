    "it is generally recognized that mapping of a nonlinear evolution problem , described by a partial differential equation , into a simplified lattice , representing a set of coupled ordinary differential equations , appears to be a useful tool either for numerical ( or semi - analytical in the appropriate limits ) study of the dynamics or for bringing intuitive understanding of the factors dominating the behavior of the systems .",
    "examples of such approach are well known for a long time in solid state physics  @xcite ( the description of an electron in a crystal in the tight - binding approximation ) , in optics  @xcite ( the description of the electric field in arrays of waveguides ) , and more recently in the mean - field theory of bose - einstein condensates loaded in optical lattices ( see e.g.  @xcite for relevant reviews ) . in all mentioned cases ,",
    "the periodicity is usually associated with the linear properties of the system and the respective dynamics is approximately described by the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation .    on the other hand ,",
    "there has recently been an increasing interest in studying nonlinear models , where the nonlinearity is also periodically modulated in space .",
    "applications of such models extend from the propagation of electromagnetic waves in stratified media  @xcite to condensates of bosons  @xcite and condensates of boson - fermion mixtures  @xcite in optical lattices .",
    "it turned out that the spatially dependent nonlinearity may dramatically change properties of the system , in particular the regions of existence of coherent localized structures and especially their corresponding stability properties .",
    "natural questions that arise in this context are the mapping of the respective evolution equation into nonlinear lattice and the description of the existence , stability , and dynamics properties of such lattices . in the present paper",
    "we consider both of these issues .",
    "while the first issue is technical and can be straightforwardly addressed by means of the wannier function expansion , as it was suggested in  @xcite , the study of the properties of the emerging lattices is a much richer problem in the present setting ; its richness stems from the fact that spatially dependent nonlinearity gives rise to complex nonlinear inter - site interactions .",
    "such additional forms of nonlinearity as the ones extracted below can significantly change the dynamical properties of the discrete system as it was shown in earlier research devoted to the spin waves in magnetic systems  @xcite , electromagnetic waves in waveguide arrays  @xcite and to applications to arrays of bose - einstein condensates  @xcite . in the above mentioned studies of nonlinear lattices , however , one common feature was of crucial importance  that was the presence of dominant ( or at least significant ) on - site nonlinearity , which e.g. , in the case of a bec loaded in an optical lattice is typically about two orders of magnitude larger than the hopping nonlinearity . in the present paper ,",
    "we systematically derive and consider a far more general class of lattice evolution equations , including the cases where the on - site nonlinearity is exactly zero .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we deduce the relevant lattice dynamical models with inter - site nonlinearity starting with the evolution equation of the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) type with a spatially periodic potential and periodic nonlinearity . in sec .",

    "[ sec : linear ] and [ sec : nonlinear ] , we examine the respective dynamical properties of the derived quasi - linear and nonlinear models , while sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] summarizes our findings and presents our conclusions , as well as directions of potential future interest .",
    "we start with the one - dimensional nls equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the coordinate - dependent linear and nonlinear potentials respectively , both considered to be @xmath3-periodic functions : @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we concentrate on the cases where the linear potential is an even function @xmath6 , while the nonlinearity may be either even or odd : @xmath7 ( hereafter @xmath8 ) .    in order to map eq .",

    "now we make the most crucial approximation of our model , namely that the continuum eq .",
    "( [ boson1d ] ) can be accurately described within the one - band approximation .",
    "as it was shown in  @xcite , this assumption fails to describe the original continuous model when one studies dynamical processes associated with the generation of the frequencies belonging to the higher bands .",
    "however , it is reasonably accurate in describing static solutions ( in particular , localized modes ) as well as their stability",
    ". also , the lattices of generalized neighbor interactions derived below within the framework of the one - band approximation , are of interest in their own right , per their particularities and differences in comparison to other models of similar type ; cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we thus assume that only one band , say @xmath16-th one , is populated .",
    "now , substituting the expansion ( [ expan1 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ psi_fin ] ) we arrive at the equation ( see  @xcite for more details ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the nonlinear overlap integrals , @xmath21 are the coefficients of the fourier series expansion of the eigenvalue @xmath22 : @xmath23 the overbar stands for complex conjugation , and an overdot stands for the derivative with respect to time . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi1d - aaa ] ) we have taken into account that in a general situation , for a periodic potential @xmath1 of rather large amplitude , the lowest bands are very narrow , and hence the fourier coefficients @xmath21 decay rapidly with increasing @xmath24 ( so that latexmath:[$|\\omega_{0\\alpha}| \\gg |\\omega_{1\\alpha}| \\gg    coefficients @xmath21 with @xmath26 .    for the lowest bands the wannier functions are well localized on the scale of one lattice period ( and can be reasonably well approximated by the eigenstates of the linear oscillator ) and thus the overlap integrals involving next - nearest neighbors ( i.e. , lattice minima separated by two lattice maxima ) are negligibly small .",
    "this allows us to drop also the terms involving @xmath27 with at least one pair of the upper indices satisfying @xmath28 .",
    "we however emphasize , that it is of crucial importance to leave the nonlinear terms with hopping between the neighbor sites , which for specific choices of the nonlinear interactions @xmath2 can be comparable with or even stronger than the on - site nonlinearity ( see below ) .",
    "now we use the symmetry of the integrals @xmath29 with respect to permutations of the indices and introduce @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath2 even and odd and @xmath33 in the case of odd nonlinearity ( @xmath32 ) the terms @xmath34 and @xmath35 are always equal to zero due to the fact that the integrand in ( [ w_def ] ) is odd with respect to the points @xmath36 and @xmath37 , correspondingly .",
    "we thus arrive at the equation @xmath38 where we have dropped the zone index @xmath16 ( e.g. @xmath39 is redefined as @xmath40 , etc . )",

    "( [ boson1d ] ) .",
    "the deduced model ( [ eq : psi1d - exp1 ] ) allows for a number of interesting particular cases .",
    "first of all , however we notice that in the case of odd nonlinearity function , i.e. , for @xmath32 , neither purely even ( @xmath44 ) , nor purely odd ( @xmath45 ) solutions can exist .",
    "this follows directly from the symmetry of eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi1d - exp1 ] ) [ or eq .  ( [ psi_fin ] ) ] .    for illustration of the localized solutions we use the potential @xmath46 ( both for the detailed calculations of this section , and for the numerical simulations of the following sections ) .",
    "also we restrict our considerations to the first band , i.e. we take @xmath47 . in that case , the linear overlap coefficients for the first band are computed as @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50",
    ".    one can distinguish five cases as follows :    : @xmath51 .",
    "this is a quasi - linear case , which is made possible , for example by an odd nonlinearity ( @xmath32 ) of the form @xmath52 ( obviously a number of possible realizations of this and other cases reported below is naturally unlimited ) .",
    "our approach both in this example and below is motivated by the nature of the lattice that we wish to construct ( i.e. , by the type of overlap integral that we wish to preserve or eliminate ) .",
    "for instance , in this example , the odd nonlinearity guarantees that @xmath53 , while the expression of eq .",
    "( [ linear ] ) uses one tunable parameter ( the amplitude of the second harmonic ) to achieve @xmath54 .",
    "_ case 2 _ : @xmath53 , @xmath55 , is achieved e.g. by choosing @xmath56 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "now the lattice model ( [ eq : psi1d - exp1 ] ) is reduced to @xmath57 and in the case at hand @xmath58 .",
    "alternatively , this case can be realized by choosing even nonlinearity ( @xmath31 ) @xmath59 now @xmath60 and the lattice equation reads : @xmath61    _ case 3 _ : @xmath62 , @xmath63 is obtained , for instance , for the even nonlinearity ( @xmath31 ) @xmath64 for which @xmath65 . the model ( [ eq : psi1d - exp1 ] ) is now simplified @xmath66    _ case 4 _ : @xmath67 , @xmath68 can be achieved by using an even nonlinearity ( @xmath31 ) @xmath69 now the overlap integrals are as follows @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
