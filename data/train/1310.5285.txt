    "the semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering of lepton on nuclear target has been one of the most active frontiers in nuclear physics and particle physics over the past three decades . after the pioneering measurement of hadronization in the nuclear medium at slac@xmath1}$ ]",
    ", more precise data were reported by the hermes@xmath2}$ ] and clas@xmath3}$ ] collaborations .",
    "it is desirable that the quantitative information on the quark propagation and hadronization in the nuclear medium can be obtained by means of the observed hadron distributions and multiplicities from various nuclei .",
    "furthermore , the quantitative information can provide enlightenments and references for the study of quark - gluon plasma and its space - time evolution in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions .    in the semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering on nuclei , a virtual photon from the incident lepton",
    "is absorbed by a quark within a nucleus , the highly virtual colored quark traverses over some distance through the cold nuclear medium , evolves subsequently into an observed hadron .",
    "there is a key physical quantity , i.e. , the characteristic time of quark propagation , or so - called hadron formation time .",
    "the hadron formation time is referred in detail to the time between the moment that the quark is struck by the virtual photon and the moment that the prehadron ( the predecessor of the final hadron ) is formed . if the hadron formation time is short enough , the prehadron is formed inside the target nucleus .",
    "in addition of the struck quark energy loss due to multiple interactions with the surrounding nuclear medium and gluon radiation , the prehadron can interact via the relevant hadronic interaction cross section , causing a further reduction of the observed hadron yield .",
    "thereupon , when hadronization takes place inside the nucleus , semi - inclusive deep inelastic lepton - nucleus collisions can provide the important information on the space - time development of the hadronization process in the nuclear medium .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that hadronization in the nuclear medium are intrinsically non - perturbative qcd processes .",
    "the perturbative calculation can not be applied to evaluate the underlying interactions in the qcd framework .",
    "two classes of theoretical phenomenological models , the absorption - type models@xmath4}$ ] and the parton energy loss models@xmath5}$ ] , were proposed to investigate the experimental data from the semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering of lepton on the nucleus@xmath6}$ ] .",
    "however , the two extreme mechanisms do not give the best description of the experimental measurements .",
    "in addition , whatever the physical mechanism , the atomic mass dependence for the attenuation of hadron production will be an important ingredient .",
    "nonetheless , the recent researches@xmath7}$ ] indicate that atomic mass dependence of hadron production is far from being expected by the absorption and parton energy loss models .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the atomic mass dependence of hadron production would be allowed to discriminate between the two different mechanisms .    in our preceding article@xmath8}$ ] , by means of the hadron formation time , the relevant data with quark hadronization occurring outside the nucleus",
    "are picked out from hermes experimental results@xmath9}$ ] on the one - dimensional dependence of the multiplicity ratio as a function of the energy fraction @xmath10 .",
    "we have calculated the nuclear modifications of hadron production in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering in a parton energy loss model .",
    "the energy loss per unit length is obtained for an outgoing quark by the global fit of the selected experimental data . in this paper",
    "we employ the so called two dimensional data from recent hermes experiment on the multiplicity ratio for the production of positively and negatively charged pions and kaons@xmath11}$ ] .",
    "the experimental data with quark hadronization occurring inside the nucleus are selected by means of the hadron formation time . the quark propagation and hadronization",
    "are studied in the nuclear medium .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , the brief formalism for the hadron multiplicity in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering on the nucleus . in section 3 ,",
    "the numerical computations for the multiplicity ratio are presented and compared with experimental data .",
    "finally , a summary is presented .",
    "at leading order(lo ) in perturbative qcd , the hadron multiplicity can be obtained from normalizing the semi - inclusive deep inelastic lepton nucleus scattering yield @xmath12 to the deep inelastic scattering yield @xmath13 ,",
    "@xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16.\\ ] ] in the above equation , @xmath17 is the virtual photon energy , @xmath18 is the charge of the quark with flavor @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the nuclear quark distribution function with bjorken variable @xmath21 and photon virtuality @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the differential cross section for lepton - quark scattering at leading order , @xmath24 is the nuclear modified fragmentation function of a quark of flavour @xmath19 into a hadron @xmath25 , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the fine structure constant and the fraction of the incident lepton energy transferred to the target , respectively .",
    "after a quark within a nucleus interacts with a virtual photon from the incident lepton , the struck quark can lose its energy owing to multiple scattering and gluon radiation while propagating through the nucleus .",
    "the quark energy fragmenting into a hadron shifts from @xmath28 to @xmath29 , which results in a rescaling of the energy fraction of the produced hadron : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are , respectively , the measured hadron energy and the quark energy loss in the nuclear medium .",
    "thus , the fragmentation function in the nuclear medium is assumed to be@xmath8}$ ] @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the standard ( vacuum ) fragmentation function of a quark of flavour @xmath19 into a hadron @xmath25 .    in order to further consider the hadronization in the nuclear medium",
    ", it is assumed that the quack struck by the virtual photon at a longitudinal position @xmath27 fragments into a prehadronic state at the point @xmath35 and soon after the final hadron is created .",
    "the prehadronic state and the final hadron propagate through nuclear matter and interact with the surrounding nucleons in the target nucleus , causing a further reduction of the observed hadron yield . in the case of treating the prehadron and",
    "the hadron as a single object created at @xmath35 , bialas and chmaj@xmath36}$ ] provided the probability @xmath37 that the virtual colored quark fragments into a hadron at a distance @xmath38 , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the hadron formation time .",
    "the survival probability @xmath41 of this hadron can be obtained from @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the hadron - nucleon inelastic cross section , and @xmath44 is the nuclear density profile normalized to unity as a function of impact parameter @xmath45 and longitudinal coordinate @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , the nuclear absorption factor @xmath46 , which is defined as the probability that neither the prehadron nor hadron have interacted with a nucleon , is given as , @xmath47    with combining the influence of nuclear absorption of the final hadron and quark energy loss on the hadron production occurring inside the nucleus , the hadron multiplicity can be presented as @xmath48",
    "the hermes collaboration recently reported the two - dimensional data on the multiplicity ratios for positively and negatively charged pions and kaons produced on neon , krypton , and xenon targets relative to deuterium , in three z slices as a function of @xmath17 , and in three @xmath17 slices as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "we pick out the experimental data with quark hadronization occurring inside the nucleus by means of the hadron formation time @xmath49 ( @xmath50)@xmath51}$ ] .",
    "more specifically , if @xmath40 is less than @xmath52 ( @xmath52 = @xmath53fm ) , hadronization occurs inside the nucleus .",
    "otherwise , hadrons are produced outside the target nucleus . as for the cases with quark hadronization occurring inside the nucleus , we compute at leading order the hadron multiplicity ratios @xmath54 , @xmath55=\\int \\frac{1}{n^{dis}_{a}}\\frac{dn^{h}_{a}(\\nu , z)}{dzd\\nu}d\\nu \\bigg/\\int \\frac{1}{n^{dis}_{d}}\\frac{dn^{h}_{d}(\\nu , z)}{dzd\\nu}d\\nu.\\ ] ] in the calculation ,",
