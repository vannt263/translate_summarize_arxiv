    "nevertheless , the corresponding simple heisenberg hamiltonian does not reproduce entirely the features of the raman spectrum @xcite and additional effects such as second - neighbor magnetic coupling @xmath13 and four - spin cyclic exchange have been invoked @xcite . while an upper bond for @xmath13 ( @xmath149 mev ) has been given from raman experiments@xcite , the amplitude of the four - spin operator in this kind of compounds is a matter of discussion .",
    "previous works have shown that this cyclic operator corresponds to a fourth - order term in the hubbard model , scaling as @xmath15 , with @xmath16=40 @xcite or @xmath16=80 @xcite , depending on the formal writing of the hamiltonian .    regarding the hole - doped material , where the conduction takes place in the cuo@xmath2 planes , the holes can be seen as centered on copper atoms with large tails on the four neighboring oxygen atoms .",
    "they move from on site to an adjacent one through the effect of a hopping operator of amplitude @xmath7 , for which there is no direct experimental evaluation , but values around -0.5 ev are considered as reasonable @xcite .",
    "one of the most widely employed model hamiltonians used for the interpretation of the properties of these materials , through a hole - pairing mechanism , is the so - called @xmath17 model @xcite which combines spin coupling and hole hopping : @xmath18 the adequacy of such a simple hamiltonian to incorporate the physics of the problem is questionable . hopping between second - neighbor sites",

    "the model space and the exact eigenstates must be in strong correspondence , i.e. one must choose both spaces so that the vectors @xmath40 have the largest projections on the model space .",

    "scheme iii +    to 1.4 cm      as in the case of magnetic interactions , the first - neighbor hopping integral ( @xmath7 ) is also independent on the size of the cluster ( table 2 ) , a value of -558 mev has been found in 1hole - doped linear cluster , -552 mev in 1hole - doped plaquette and -555 mev in previously reported binuclear cluster@xcite .",
    "this value is in accordance with a generally accepted value of -500 mev for these compounds@xcite .",

    "one corresponds to a a third - order contribution , scaling as @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the hopping integral between the o @xmath27 and the cu @xmath88 orbitals , @xmath89 is the hopping integral between the o @xmath27 orbitals and @xmath90 is the o @xmath91 cu @xmath88 charge - transfer excitation energy ( scheme iv ) . since @xmath89 , @xmath87 and @xmath90",
    "are negative quantities , the third - order contribution results in a positive magnitude .",
    "there exists an alternative pathway corresponding to a fourth - order contribution , scaling as @xmath92 , with opposite sign .",
    "since the third - order contribution is expected to be larger than the fourth - order one , the resulting sign of @xmath8 is positive .",
    "a moderate amplitude of the hopping integral between third - neighbors ( distance 2r ) has been extracted from the calculations on the linear cluster .",
    "the extension of this coupling is controlled by through - bond interactions , but in contrast with the plaquette , only fourth - order process can be written here , smaller in magnitude and with an opposite sign with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "scheme iv +    to 5.0 cm    when an additional hole is introduced in the system , the nn hopping integral is unchanged when the hole is placed in a perpendicular position to the bond ( @xmath7=-558 mev in the 2hole - doped plaquette , scheme va ) , but its absolute value is augmented when the hole is placed in a colinear position to the bond ( @xmath7=-600 mev in the 2hole - doped linear cluster , scheme vb ) .",
    "scheme v +    to 1.8 cm    the presence of the extra hole does not influence significantly neither the second - neighbor ( @xmath8= + 130 mev to be compared with + 112 mev in absence of this additional hole ) nor the third - neighbor ( @xmath93=-36 mev versus -47 mev ) hopping integrals .      an additional information coming from these calculations concerns the singlet - displacement operator(table 3 ) .",
    "it is a three - site / two - electron operator , which moves the pair of electron , coupled in a singlet , toward a hole placed in a neighbor position .",
    "thus , a singlet on sites @xmath94 and @xmath95 , @xmath96 containing a hole , is displaced to the positions @xmath95 and @xmath96 , the hole being in @xmath94 ( scheme vi ) : +   + scheme vi +    to 1.2 cm    it can be written as : @xmath97\\delta(n_a+n_b+n_c,2)\\ ] ] where @xmath98 controls the fact that the three centers bear only two electrons , i.e. that the singlet can only move toward a hole . as in the precedent parameters ,",
    "the amplitude @xmath9 depends on the relative position of the hole .",
    "if the singlet moves to a neighbor bond in the plaquette ( i.e. , the hole is placed in a perpendicular position to the singlet bond ) , the value is @xmath9= -41 mev while it goes to @xmath9=-80 mev if the hole is on the same axis than the singlet .",
    "the presence of a second hole in the plaquette does not affect the amplitude of the singlet - displacement ( @xmath9= -37 mev ) .",
    "there exists also a small similar operator involving the diagonal of the square ( @xmath99= 9 mev ) : @xmath100\\delta(n_b+n_c+n_d,2)\\ ] ] moving the electrons as shown in scheme vii .",
    "the value of this operator in presence of a second hole is very close to the preceding value : @xmath99= 14 mev .",
    "scheme vii +    to 1.5 cm      the absolute value of the hole - hole repulsion is not accessible , but the effective hamiltonian gives the difference between two situations ( table 4 ) . from the plaquette",
    ", we can extract the relative stability of two holes placed in nnn positions with respect to two holes in nn : @xmath101    this is significantly larger than the values usually accepted for simulations @xcite .",
    "one should stress on the fact that this value takes into account the dynamical repolarization effects of all the atoms explicitly treated in the calculation , i.e. , the screening by the twelve in - plane oxygen atoms linked to the four cu atoms of the plaquette .",
    "it misses the polarization of the rest of the environment .",
    "taking into account the polarization of a large surrounding shell , with a value of the polarizability of the o@xmath102 ion , @xmath103 @xmath104 ( obtained from a series of finite - field ab initio calculations on an embedded @xmath105 cluster ) , in agreement with experimental estimates @xcite , one diminishes the hole - hole repulsion difference to @xmath10=0.80 ev which remains a rather large value . from the linear cluster ,",
    "it is possible to estimate the energy gain obtained when placing two holes in nnnn positions ( distance 2r ) instead of adjacent positions ( distance r ) : @xmath106= 1.77 ev , with a final value of @xmath107=1.47 ev once the environment polarization effects have been taken into account .",
    "these values of _ differences _ between hole - hole repulsions may seem very large and most of the calculations introducing this repulsion in a t - j - v model use to take smaller values ( @xmath108)@xcite when trying to exhibit hole - pairing phenomenon .",
    "the above calculated values are smaller than the corresponding electrostatic quantities calculated in a point charge approximation : @xmath10=1.12 ev and @xmath107=1.90 ev . the delocalization of the holes on the oxygen atoms should result in larger repulsions , especially for @xmath109 since the two holes share an oxygen atom , and our values , which exhibit a significant screening , do not seem unrealistic .",
    "the two preceding sections indicate that the presence of holes in the immediate vicinity of a bond may affect the values of the spin coupling and of the hopping integral on this bond , and that this effect is anisotropic , i.e. , does not only depend on the minimal distance of the hole to the atoms of the bond .",
    "hence it seems important to rationalize these effects if possible .      _ the hopping integral . _ + the rationalization of this anisotropy is possible in terms of the two - band model . the @xmath24 hopping integral results from a second order effect ( scheme viii ,",

    "the model space determinant energies are no longer degenerate and one shall take their mean energy as the zero - order energy . let consider now the effect on the bond directed along @xmath114 of an adjacent hole placed either on the @xmath115 direction , as occurs in the plaquette , or on the @xmath114 axis , as in the linear cluster ( schemes va and vb ) . in situation ( va ) the zero - order mean electrostatic energy with the hole is @xmath116 . in the corresponding charge transfer state",
    "the mean electrostatic energy with the hole is @xmath117 , i.e. , the excitation energy is increased by a small quantity : @xmath118 which should diminish slightly the absolute value of the hopping integral .",
    "in contrast , for situation ( vb ) , @xmath119 and @xmath120 hence @xmath121 which should increase the absolute value of @xmath24 , in agreement with our calculation .",
    "this analysis is quite rudimentary , it neglects the possible effects of the polarization of the orbitals on the @xmath87 integrals and rests on a crude evaluation of the electrostatic effects on the denominators ( holes considered as centered on cu sites , neglecting their oxygen character ) , but it seems to agree with the computed trends .",

    "+ the same kind of analysis may be tempted for the @xmath6 coupling constant , which is now a fourth - order quantity ( scheme ix ) : @xmath122 which involves intermediate situations of opposite polarities , but with the same energy : @xmath123 . in the undoped system , @xmath124=@xmath125=@xmath20 , which corresponds to the coulombic repulsion of two electrons placed in the same @xmath88 orbital .",
    "scheme ix +    to 5.0 cm     + adding an external hole will not modify the electrostatic zero - order energy , but will affect the energies of all intermediate states , so that the coupling becomes : + @xmath126 ( for the top pathway ) @xmath127 @xmath128 ( for the bottom one ) .",

    "we get the same value @xmath6=93 mev as for the 2hole - containing plaquette .",
    "table 5 gives the results for @xmath6 concerning a series of possibilities with one remote hole , two holes in different positions , together with the variation of the electrostatic energy in the intermediate charge transfer states with respect to the non - doped case , expressed in ev .",
    "figure 4a shows the correlation between the calculated @xmath6 value with the variation of the electrostatic energy @xmath160 in the intermediate charge transfer states .",
    "the correlation is quite satisfactory and suggests the following law in ev : @xmath161 an analogous fit of the hopping integral dependence on the variation of the electrostatic energy in the intermediate charge transfer state @xmath162 has been tempted from the values of @xmath7 ( table 5 ) calculated on binuclear complexes in presence of external hole(s ) .",
    "the correlation is less satisfactory ( figure 4b ) .",
    "the distortions of the active orbitals in presence of these close holes should be non - negligible and should affect the amplitudes of the hopping integral in a rather complex manner .",
    "however , it seems simpler to research a linear law rather than to produce and handle a dictionary of operator amplitudes considering exhaustively all possible occurences .",
    "we therefore propose the following fit in ev for the first - neighbor hopping integral : @xmath163",
    "the numerical results obtained here above suggest that the usual t - j or t - j - v model hamiltonins neglect important physical effects , which should be incorporated into an extended model hamiltonian .",
    "the main deviations from the t - j hamiltonian are the following : + ( i ) the inclusion of the second - neighbor hopping , @xmath164 + 110 mev .",
    "the third - neighbor interaction @xmath165 -40 mev could tentatively be omitted .",
    "recent analysis of angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy data has shown that both @xmath8 and @xmath93 are necessary for understanding the dispersion and line shape of the spectral function in the t - j model @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite have estimated the ratio @xmath166 and @xmath167 to be -0.12 and 0.08 , respectively , by fitting the tight - binding fermi surface to the experimental one in the overdoped sample @xcite on the assumption that in the overdoped region the fermi surface of the tight - binding band is the same as that of the t - t-t \"- j model .",
    "the values here - proposed are in good agreement with these ratio : @xmath166 = -0.19 and @xmath167=0.08 but not with the ratio @xmath168 proposed by these authors ( @xmath169=0.4 vs @xmath168=0.22 ) .",
    "+ ( ii ) the singlet displacement operator @xmath170 has to be taken into account , at least for the colinear displacement , since @xmath171 -80 mev .",
    "+ ( iii ) the hole - hole repulsion appears to be far from negligible . due to",
    "possible screening effects and electrostatic mean cancellations by the sr ions , it is certainly reasonable to neglect the hole - hole repulsions beyond the third - neighbors .",
    "even if the calculated values @xmath10=0.8 ev and @xmath107=1.5 ev were somewhat exagerated , these interactions certainly play an important role .",
    "+ ( iv ) the magnetic coupling and hopping integral between adjacent atoms depend in a stereospecific manner on the existence and position of hole(s ) in the immediate vicinity .",
    "a simple correlation with the electrostatic energies of the intermediate ligand to metal charge transfer states has been proposed resulting in simple formulas , which should be used in a realistic model hamiltonian . from the exploratory calculations appearing in table 5 , and for sake of simplicity , it seems sufficient to consider the first neighbors of the bond in the calculation of the electrostatic energy changes @xmath172 and @xmath162 appearing in formulas ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) , respectively",
    ".    one may therefore propose the following extended t - j model hamiltonian : @xmath173+\\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\sum_{<pqr>}^{connected } h_{sd}^{pqr } \\cdot ( a_{p}^{\\dag}a_{\\bar{q}}^{\\dag}a_{q}a_{\\bar{r}}+ a_{r}^{\\dag}a_{\\bar{q}}^{\\dag}a_q a_{\\bar{p } } - a_{p}^{\\dag}a_{\\bar{q}}^{\\dag}a_{r}a_{\\bar{q } } -a_{r}^{\\dag}a_{\\bar{q}}^{\\dag}a_p a_{\\bar{q}}+ s.c . )",
    "\\delta(n_p+n_q+n_r,2)+\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{pq}^{\\le nnnn } v_{pq } \\cdot \\delta(n_p,0 ) \\cdot \\delta(n_q,0 ) \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this hamiltonian , @xmath174 and @xmath175 reflect the dependence of the first - neighbor interactions on the number and position of the adjacent holes , which is controlled by the energy changes in the charge transfer intermediates .",
    "the second - neighbor interactions are not influenced by the presence of adjacent holes and the displacement of a singlet takes placed toward an adjacent hole , so the positions occupied by the singlet and the hole have to be connected .",
    "the here - proposed modifications with respect to the usual t - j or t - j - v hamiltonians are important .",
    "we would like to point out that some local physical effects evidenced in the present work may have an impact on the spatial ordering of charges an spins and on their dynamics . in a crude static",
    "look at this problem one may notice that stripping separation of charges and spins ( i ) favors the mobility of holes in the charged column , since @xmath24 and @xmath176 values become especially larger , ( ii ) leads to a stronger magnetic coupling in the bonds perpendicular to the stripes ( with a trend to form singlets on these bonds ) .",
    "the two last effects would result from the three body corrections on @xmath24 and @xmath176 created by the adjacent holes .",
    "finally , ( iii ) the mobility of the stripes can be enhanced by the second - neighbor hopping integral and by the singlet displacement operator .",
    "we think that our calculations are reliable enough and that their qualitative conclusions and quantitative estimates deserve to be considered in simulations of the collective properties of the lattice , whatever the method used for such a study .",
