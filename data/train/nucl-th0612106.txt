    "the investigation of mirror nuclei along the @xmath3 line is of significant interest since it addresses directly the isospin symmetry problem in nuclear many - fermion systems .",
    "isospin symmetry is approximate due to the charge dependence in strong force and the coulomb force between protons .",
    "direct evidence of isospin symmetry breaking ( isb ) can be deduced from ground - state displacement energies ( mde ) and excitation - energy differences between analogous states ( med ) in mirror nuclei . in the past decade , numerous experimental and theoretical efforts have been devoted to mirror pairs in the lower @xmath1 shell and extends the knowledge of med evolution patterns to high - spin states @xcite .    the mde range from a few to tens of mev , with the dominant origin in the coulomb field @xcite . however",
    ", if only the coulomb effect is considered , a persistent inaccuracy exists between the theoretical results of mde and corresponding experimental observations @xcite .",
    "this long - standing problem is referred to as nolen - schiffer anomaly @xcite , revealing the necessity to introduce charge symmetry breaking ( csb ) in strong force in depicting nuclear properties @xcite .",
    "contributions from the coulomb field and csb in strong force to med has been shown theoretically , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite , finding that the later is at least as important as the former .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study the structures and decay properties of @xmath0 mirror nuclei in the lower _ fp _ shell by shell - model diagonalization method and to investigate the effects of isb .",
    "we employ an isospin - nonconserving effective hamiltonian @xcite derived microscopically from a high - precision version of the charge - dependent bonn ( cd - bonn ) nucleon - nucleon ( _ nn _ ) potential @xcite using the folded - diagram renormalization method @xcite .",
    "the charge dependence of the _ nn _ interaction is retained , enabling to quantify its effect on nuclear properties exactly with full model - space diagonalizations . in our previous work , the effective hamiltonian has been used to study the isospin structures of odd - odd @xmath3 nuclei in the lower _ fp _ shell @xcite .",
    "the essence of the shell model lies in that the true eigen energies and wave functions of the original many - body hamiltonian can be constructed by diagonalizing an effective hamiltonian in a constrained finite model space @xcite .",
    "the model - space dependent effective hamiltonian can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the effective one - body hamiltonian with @xmath6 being single - particle energies ( spe ) .",
    "in general calculations , the effective interaction @xmath7 is expressed as two - body matrix elements ( tbme ) in harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis .",
    "the effective interaction can be decomposed into two parts .",
    "the monopole part of the interaction , in combination with the spe , gives out the bulk properties of the nuclei .",
    "the multipole part of the effective interaction accounts for the configuration - mixing which is essential for modern shell - model calculations @xcite .    the effective interaction is directly related to the underlying _ nn _ potential . due to the unperturbative nature of the qcd at low energies ,",
    "most of the knowledge concerning the _ nn _ force is from the measurements of nucleon - nucleon and nucleon - deuteron scattering properties .",
    "the scattering behavior can be well approximated by one - boson - exchange ( obe ) potential which has been commonly employed in modern realistic _ nn _ forces @xcite . the bare _ nn _ potential , however , is unsuitable for direct applications in nuclear systems due to the strong repulsive core . in early practices ,",
    "the brueckner g reaction matrix is introduced to evaluate the effective interaction for a chosen model space , as done in the derivation of the famous kuo - brown interaction @xcite .",
    "the g matrix takes into account the short - range repulsive behavior of the _ nn _ potential and satisfies @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the bare @xmath10 potential and @xmath11 the correlated wave function .",
    "effective interaction with the g matrix may lead to bad behavior with increasing particle numbers .",
    "the folded - diagram renormalization method is proposed to include the core - polarization effect from the configuration - mixing outside the model space . folded and non - folded diagrams are introduced in evaluating the time - evolution operator in time - dependent perturbation theory in which both contributions from the model space and the excluded space are considered .",
    "the two kinds of diagrams can be evaluated from the g matrix .    in 1990s , various high - precision phenomenological obe potentials ( e.g. ,",
    "av18 of the argonne group , nijm i @xmath12 ii of the nigmegen group and cd - bonn of the bonn group ) have been proposed by fitting the huge amount of neutron - proton and proton - proton scattering data available @xcite , with reasonable descriptions of the charge dependence in strong force . both charge independence and charge symmetry",
    "are related to the symmetric properties of the @xmath10 force under rotations in isospin space .",
    "the breaking of charge symmetry and charge independence are mainly due to the mass splitting of the nucleons ( m@xmath13 m@xmath14 ) and pions ( m@xmath15 m@xmath16 ) .",
    "csb is a special case of cib , referring to the difference between the proton - proton and neutron - neutron interactions .",
    "cib means that all interactions in isospin @xmath17 state , the proton - proton , neutron - neutron and neutron - proton interactions , are different , after electromagnetic effects have been removed .",
    "all the obe potentials have similar low - momentum behavior . in the present work",
    ", we use a new high - precision cd - bonn potential .",
    "detailed descriptions on the cd - bonn potential can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the cd - bonn potential ,",
    "both csb and cib are embedded in all partial waves with angular momentum @xmath18 .",
    "the off - shell behavior of the nonlocal covariant feynman amplitudes used in the potential can lead to larger binding energies for nuclear many - body systems , which can help to improve the effective interaction s performance around the @xmath19 shell closure @xcite .",
