    "the delocalized @xmath51-orbitals and a large @xmath25 atomic weight ( z=44 ) make so coupling operative in these materials ( as the so coupling strength @xmath52 ) . whether a @xmath31-wave triplet instability , derived from a momentum - dependent so coupling , drives a pairing instability in the material at low temperatures , has been debated over last two decades . however , this superconductivity is not the focus of our local dmft analysis .",

    "we discuss the results we obtained from dft+dmft calculations on @xmath3 .",
    "the first - principles calculations and subsequent wannierization provide us with 3 orbitals active at the fermi level ( fig  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "these orbitals are primarily derived from @xmath25-@xmath1 and have reasonably large hybridization with the @xmath26-@xmath31 states at the fermi level . while the hybridization of the @xmath25-@xmath1 and apical oxygens are predominantly between @xmath25-@xmath1 @xmath54 and @xmath26-@xmath47 @xmath55     and wannier fitting for the bands crossing the fermi level .",

    ". the latter kind of hybridization is more favorable , and is reflected in the energy range of 300 mev about the fermi energy , while the earlier one is relevant away from the fermi level ( @xmath61 1 ev ) .",
    "these hybridizations lead to dispersive electrons in the @xmath62 octahedral geometry .",

    "although the rotation and mixing of the original bands have taken place , the band characterization , as is apparent in the fig  [ fig1 ] , allows us to refer to them as nominally @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 bands respectively .",
    "subsequently we will take these wannier bands as input of dmft and refer to them similarly for the rest of the discussion .",
    "we choose a value @xmath9=2.30 ev and @xmath10=0.40 ev , as prescribed in literature  @xcite for @xmath3 .",
    "the choice is motivated by the fact that it predicts the experimentally derived values of local moment and quasi - particle weight over a large range of temperatures .",
    "imaginary parts of the single - particle self - energy im@xmath65 ( fig  [ fig2](b ) ) and the green s function im@xmath66 are plotted for individual orbitals over a range of temperature between 120k to 19k .",

    "we switch over to static and dynamic vertex corrected spin and charge susceptibilities to glean whether the incoherence to coherence cross - over is reflected in the two - particle sector : it often happens that a low energy single - particle description might not be adequate to trace such cross - over scales associated with multi - particle dynamics .",
    "the local dynamic spin susceptibilities ( @xmath81 ) have been plotted against @xmath84 ( matsubara time ) for a large range of temperatures ( fig  [ fig2](d ) ) .",

    "the maximum value of so splitting is @xmath94 mev while it is negligible at some symmetry points .",
    "the effect of so , however , can hardly be realized by looking at the momentum integrated density of states of @xmath3 across the fermi level .",
    "we find that the nature of @xmath20 and @xmath95 hybridization remains more or less similar to the results without so .",
    "we identify the bands active at the fermi level and perform the wannierization .",
    "similar to our previous calculations , three wannier fit orbitals have predominant contributions from @xmath96 orbitals .",
    "we perform our dmft calculations using these so - coupled orbitals .     with high symmetry (",
    "space - group i4/mmm @xmath97 ) tetragonal structure ( @xmath76=7.52 a@xmath77 and @xmath78=24.1645 a@xmath77).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    with so included , the dmft self - energies ( fig  [ fig3](b ) ) have similar qualitative features as without so , though the details are significantly different . here again the intercept of im@xmath65 ( fig  [ fig3](c ) ) at @xmath67=0 decreases with increasing temperature , but the drop is sharper and non - monotonic across 24k .",
    "the @xmath74 is , in turn , found to increase sharply across it ( fig  [ fig3](c ) ) .",
    "both im@xmath65 and im@xmath66 can be found to have sharp change of slope below @xmath68=0.03 ev ( fig  [ fig3](b ) ) , marking the advent of coherence below t@xmath98 . at this point",
    "we look at the two - particle vertex corrected responses .",
    "the @xmath81 ( fig  [ fig3](d ) ) shows fermi - liquid features , with a @xmath86 intercept @xmath99 and @xmath87 behavior at low energies , below 24k .",
    "the @xmath82 ( fig  [ fig3](e ) ) seems to be deviating from the high temperature curie - weiss behavior precisely below the same scale of @xmath100 , marking the emergence of coherence in the system .",
    "hence , the scenario with so is distinctly different from the scenario without so . with",
    "so included , both the single and two - particle static and dynamic responses register the emergence of coherence quite consistently .",
    "the local orbital dynamic susceptibilities get suppressed at low temperatures in the present analysis and become significantly smaller than the local spin susceptibilities .",
    "the lifting of degeneracy in the orbital sector due to so coupling is responsible for the quenching of orbital moment .",
    "the dynamic local charge susceptibilities , however , still remain divergent and singular down to 19k implying a soft charge fluctuations down to the lowest temperatures .",
    "the values of real space hopping we get from wannierization are also suggestive .",
    "the relative magnitudes of the in - plane and out - of - plane hopping elements provide insight into the effective dimensionality of the material .",
    "the @xmath101 ratio for @xmath3 is 3.294 and the itinerant electrons have the in - plane hopping elements nearly an order of magnitude larger than their out of plane counterpart ( fig  [ fig3](a ) ) .",
    "the system is quasi-@xmath16 in this case , supported also by a large resistivity anisotropy ratio  @xcite ( @xmath102 ) and lesser hybridization between the apical oxygens and @xmath103 orbitals",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether the replacement of @xmath42 by a smaller cation @xmath27 leads to any kind of dimensional cross - over , and whether that cross - over encounters a structural or magnetic critical point .",
    "@xmath62 octahedron gets distorted ( fig  [ fig4 ] ) significantly as the smaller @xmath27 cation replaces @xmath42 .",
    "as suggested from experiments  @xcite , the distortion takes place in steps : first a rotation of the octahedra about the @xmath78 axis takes place and then a tilt of the octahedra , followed finally by a flattening of it .",
    "@xmath46 undergoes the first two kinds of distortions , starting from a nearly clean undistorted @xmath62 octahedra in @xmath3 .",
    "the gga calculations allow us to see the primary changes in its band structure thereon .",
    "the @xmath25-@xmath1 bands get significantly narrowed in this case and the @xmath21 orbitals contribute finite density of states at the fermi level alongside the @xmath19 orbitals .",
    "although the contribution from @xmath21 is much less than @xmath19 , it is finite and not negligible compared to @xmath19-like density of states at the fermi level for @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath56 orbital is the majority contributor to dos , with a sharp van - hove like feature within an energy range of 50 mev of the fermi level .",
    "the @xmath58 and @xmath105 orbitals are secondary contributors . while @xmath106 and @xmath107 orbitals of in plane ( @xmath108 plane ) oxygens hybridize strongly with the @xmath109 at the fermi level , @xmath110 and @xmath106 orbitals of apical oxygen hybridizes strongly with the @xmath109 nearly 700 - 800 mev away from the fermi level",
    ". however , wannierization and band characterization suggest that the wannier fit bands can be identified ( similar to @xmath3 ) as predominantly @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58-derived as shown in the band characterization plot in fig  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the sharp van - hove feature close to the fermi surface and significantly narrow band - width of the @xmath111 orbitals already place the material close to a ferromagnetic stoner instability .",
    "we use these three wannier - fit ( projected using the @xmath112 bands ) bands as inputs for dmft .",
    "the dmft calculations are performed with @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the rationale behind these parameter values is again the same @xmath115 the local static quantities are reproduced for a range of temperatures with these parameters .",
    "these numbers are larger than the corresponding numbers for @xmath3 , for the bandwidth of the bands crossing the fermi level has decreased significantly now due to smaller cationic distortion . im@xmath65 and im@xmath66 are plotted as functions of @xmath68 in fig  [ fig6](b ) and they show tendencies towards enhanced coherence with lowering temperatures . however , unlike @xmath3 , here the material remains non - fermi - liquid down to the lowest temperatures probed .",
    "the intercept , as shown in fig  [ fig6](c ) of im@xmath65 at @xmath68=0 is nearly independent of temperature and remains large and finite down to the lowest temperature .",
    "the orbital selective nature of the im@xmath65 can be gleaned now from the fact that @xmath56 orbital has a very small intercept at @xmath68=0 compared to @xmath57 and @xmath58 orbitals , but the mass enhancement factors for the @xmath57 and @xmath58 orbitals steadily decrease with lowering temperature ( fig  [ fig6](c ) ) .",
    "the dependence is not as monotonic for @xmath57 orbital .",
    "this can again be corroborated by the orbital - specific im@xmath66 : @xmath57 and @xmath58 orbitals have metallic coherent features while the @xmath56     and wannier fitting for the bands crossing the fermi level .",

    "we probe the two - particle dynamics and static spin and charge responses for @xmath46 below .",
    "we note an interesting fact that @xmath81 ( fig  [ fig6](d ) ) has a completely different functional dependence on @xmath84 at high temperatures ( between 600k to 120k ) and at lower temperatures ( below 120k ) .",
    "the high temperature @xmath81 suggests that even at low energies the spin is completely unquenched , while partial quenching of spins at low energies begins below 100k .",
    "thereafter , as the temperature is lowered , the spin quenching increases , but @xmath82 ( fig  [ fig6](f ) ) suggests that the response remains curie - weiss - like down to the lowest temperatures that we could access within our ct - qmc analysis .",
    "two important observations may be noted at this point .",
    "firstly , the @xmath116 follows a beautiful scaling ( fig  [ fig6]e ) as a function of @xmath117 for the temperature range between 120k to 30k , with the functional form @xmath118 and the scaling exponent @xmath119=0.10 .",
    "and secondly , @xmath82 ( fig  [ fig6](f ) ) for this material , in this temperature range , is more than an order of magnitude larger  @xcite than @xmath82 for @xmath3 . and",
    "finally , the linear fit to the @xmath120 vs @xmath100 curve shows a @xmath121 ( from @xmath122 ) which is positive and large ( 41 k ) .",
    "all these signatures unambiguously indicate a strong quantum critical ferromagnetic fluctuation arising from a temperature which is possibly lower than our reach within ct - qmc at @xmath123 .",
    "this could well be a critical end point ( @xmath124 ) as there is no experimentally reported structural transition either suppressing or facilitating the critical ferromagnetic fluctuation at this point  @xcite .",
    "the orbital selective pseudogapped  @xcite nature of the density of states and non - fermi - liquid self - energy response also act as supportive informations for the observation of quantum criticality , which has been rigorously shown to be existing in different contexts  @xcitein literature , with similar single - particle responses .    both the field variables @xmath125 and @xmath116 scale as functions of @xmath117 which suggests that temperature is the only scale in this parameter regime .",
    "the scaling functional form @xmath118 ,    ) and out of plane ( @xmath91 ) hopping elements for @xmath46 , extracted from real space wannier hopping matrix showing the @xmath13 electron itinerant nature .",
    "( b ) the im@xmath65 and im@xmath66 for three orbitals ( @xmath79 ) are shown over a range of temperatures .",
    "( c ) the intercepts of im@xmath65 at @xmath67=0 and the renormalized mass enhancement factors @xmath80 shows orbital selective coherence for a large range of temperatures .",
    "( d ) the dynamic spin susceptibilities ( @xmath81 ) for a range of temperatures show that the system is a bad metal over the complete temperature range as the @xmath117=0.5 intercepts of different @xmath81 curves are finite and large .",
    "( e ) the strong non - fermi liquid character of the system is evident as the @xmath126 shows clear thermal scaling collapse .",
    "( f ) the local static spin susceptibility @xmath82 shows that the system is non - fermi - liquid down to the lowest accessible temperatures.,scaledwidth=98.0% ]    hints that a conformally invariant boundary field theory is a good field theory for @xmath46 , and hence the criticality is strictly local . at this point",
    "we again choose to probe the relative scales of in - plane and out - of - plane hoppings and find that they have not changed significantly at all from the parent compound @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath101 ratio turns out to be @xmath127 which is nearly similar at @xmath128 .",
    "what interests us here , is the ratio of the in - plane and out - of - plane hopping scales .",
    "the out - of - plane hopping along the @xmath129 direction is not suppressed at all ; both in - plane and out - of - plane components ( fig  [ fig6](a ) ) are nearly of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the effective three dimensional nature of the electron hopping suggests that in spite of having a similar @xmath101 ratio the @xmath123 material is @xmath13 in electron itineracy , unlike its @xmath128 counterpart .",
    "it s worth noting , at this point , that @xmath101 ratio can not be the lone parameter deciding the effective dimensionality of a bulk single crystal .",
    "the distortion - induced changes in the @xmath111 and apical @xmath130 hybridization scales are equally important in determining the effective dimensionality .",
    "this effective dimensionality , critical ferromagnetic spin fluctuations , finite temperature curie - weiss spin susceptibility , enhanced positive @xmath121 , finite temperature scaling collapse of dynamic spin susceptibilities , and absence of any magnetic , orbital or charge ordering down to lowest temperatures suggest that @xmath123 is critical .",
    "this is again of paramount interests , as it is already reported in literature  @xcite that there is a @xmath131 line that separates the @xmath2 phase diagram in to two regions ; one with two fold in - plane susceptibility - anisotropy ( at lower @xmath45 below @xmath45=0.5 )  @xcite and the other region for @xmath132 without any anisotropy .",
    "this suggests that there is already reasonably compelling evidence that this @xmath133 could well be a quantum critical end point of the second - order structural transition .",
    "having observed the criticality at @xmath123 , it would be worth seeing , what is the effect of the critical fluctuations at lower @xmath45 values .",
    "we choose to probe @xmath4 on a similar line .",
    "as experimental evidences suggest  @xcite , @xmath4 has an afm mott insulating state below 113k .",
    "between 356k and 113k it is a paramagnetic mott insulator and above 356k , a paramagnetic bad metal .",
    "the metal to mott insulator transition at 356k is associated with a structural transition from a l - pbca ( fig  [ fig7 ] ) to s - pbca structure .",
    "we first do gga calculations using l - pbca structural inputs from experiments , perform wannierization , apply local correlations within dmft scheme on wannier - fit orbitals ( fig  [ fig8 ] ) and look for a mott metal - insulator transition .",
    "while all the @xmath136 orbitals have substantial contributions to the dos at the fermi level , @xmath137 have the dominant contributions .",
    "there are sharp van - hove features near the fermi level , but they are farther from the fermi level than those in @xmath46 . however , the bandwidth for the dispersive @xmath136 orbitals are even lower in this case than the @xmath123 material .",
    "the highly distorted octahedra allows for strong hybridization between all @xmath111 orbitals and @xmath138 orbitals : the apical oxygen @xmath139 and in - plane oxygen @xmath140 have sufficient hybridization with @xmath111 orbitals .",
    "all these facts put together , the l - pbca intrinsically has the tendency towards nesting and thence antiferromagnetic fluctuations that can stabilize a low temperature afm ground state with a gain in energy @xmath141 .",
    "but the l - pbca structural details do not explain why it should become a mott insulator below 356k .",
    "it is often suggested in the literature  @xcite that the l - pbca to s - pbca structural transition drives the mott transition associated with an orbital ordering  @xcite across 356 k. however , gorelov et al .",
    ", do not get any orbital selective mott transition for the l - pbca phase within their analysis down to 300 k. after wannierization of the gga band structure for l - pbca , we employ local correlations within dmft+ct - qmc framework and try to see if there is mott transition somewhere at lower temperature .",
    "subsequently the questions of interest are ; what is the nature of the mott insulator ?",
    "re - paraphrased somewhat , whether all the active orbitals become mott insulating or there is orbital selectivity ? how do the dmft results compare with available arpes results ? and finally , is the desired mott insulating state recovered at 356k if the s - pbca structure is subjected to local correlations within gga+u ?",
    "we choose @xmath142 and @xmath143 for the present analysis  @xcite .",
    "as the temperature is lowered from 1000k to 360k , we observe that unlike the rest of the materials that we have studied , there is no monotonic tendency for im@xmath65 and im@xmath66 ( fig  [ fig9](b ) ) towards coherence .",
    "rather , orbital specific loss of coherence can be clearly observed by lowering the temperature  @xcite .",
    "finally it is found that the @xmath56 orbital becomes mott gapped with consistent singular low energy features in the im@xmath65 below 250k .",
    "the opening of the charge gap is clearly orbital selective  @xcite in nature , as other orbitals remain metallic as far as their single - particle dynamic responses are concerned , down to the lowest temperature .",
    "one important point to note is that for @xmath46 , the orbital with primarily @xmath56 character was the one that became pseudogapped and for @xmath128 the orbital with major contribution from @xmath56 becomes mott gapped below 250k ( fig  [ fig9](c ) ) .",
    "the critical mott temperature , as is apparent , is much lower than the experimentally realised 356k scale .",
    "arpes studies do suggest  @xcite that the transition is orbital selective in nature , although the absence of orbital - selective mott nature is also supported by one arpes study  @xcite and one theoretical study  @xcite .",
    "not much can , however , be concluded from the intercept of im@xmath65 at @xmath144 and the orbital specific mass enhancement factors ( fig  [ fig9](d ) ) , except for the fact that the intercept becomes extremely large in proximity of mott transition .",
    "we find that im@xmath65 becomes singular below a critical mott temperature , and the quasi - particle description becomes somewhat untenable",
    ".    in the two - particle sector , @xmath81 ( fig  [ fig9](e ) ) suggests that the local moment remains unquenched at all energy scales in the temperature range between 800k to 400k .",
    "however , although spins remain singular down to the mott critical temperature ( @xmath145 ) , the behavior just above 356 k is deviant from curie - weiss .",
    "the high temperature @xmath82 is strictly curie - weiss within our analysis though , and a @xmath120 vs @xmath100 linear fit remarkably predicts @xmath121 to be negative ( -23 k ) ( fig  [ fig9](f ) ) , suggesting that the material is in proximity of a low temperature antiferromagnetic mott instability . as is well know from the literature",

    "we start with a high temperature l - pbca structure and cool the system down to 250k .",
    "we observe that there is a possibility of an orbital selective mott transition around this temperature .",
    "next we performed a gga calculation with the s - pbca structure and included local hubbard correlations within the gga+u framework .",

    "the large distortion of the octahedra narrows the @xmath149 bands significantly and leads to increment in the @xmath146 , driving the material to the proximity of a mott transition via a structural transition .",

    "figure  [ fig9](a ) clearly shows that , even inside the l - pbca phase , just above the mott transition , @xmath101 is @xmath151 and the out of plane hopping is significantly suppressed in comparison to the in - plane hopping scale , @xmath152 ratio being 0.3 at @xmath44 .",
    "the nearly @xmath16 nature  @xcite of the @xmath4 bulk single crystal is in marked contrast to its @xmath123 counterpart , as far as the effective dimensionality ( measured by @xmath152 ratio @xmath153 and @xmath101 ratio 3.3 for @xmath123 ) is concerned .      ) and out of plane",

    "( e ) the local static spin susceptibility @xmath82 shows that the system is non - fermi - liquid down to the mott critical temperature ( 356 k ) .",
    "however , the behavior deviates from curie - weiss above 356 k and is perfectly curie - weiss at higher temperatures.,scaledwidth=98.0% ]    and experimental findings , we see that the @xmath154 is a quantum critical end point of a second - order structural transition separating two quasi @xmath16-systems on both sides , to its right ( @xmath132 ) as well as left ( @xmath155 ) ( fig  [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "as far as crystal structures are concerned , the @xmath128 structure has higher crystal symmetries than the one at @xmath15 . the dynamic in - plane susceptibility , its anisotropy and variation across the brillouin zone ( different momentum vectors ) at different energy scales  @xcite also support the fact that an effective dimensional crossover attends the structural transition .",
    "interestingly , the critical end point is also associated with a strong local ferromagnetic fluctuation extending to finite temperatures and @xmath45 away from 0.5 .",
    "the order of magnitude increment in local static susceptibility at this particular point of the phase diagram and the falling of  @xcite on both left and right side of @xmath123 , substantiate our claims .",
    "our findings , supported amply by experimental results , therefore , raises an important question : _ is the critical point purely structural in nature?_.    at this moment we would again like to rely on the detailed calculations and the results discussed in our present work , and infer that , it is the structural change of the crystal via replacement of larger cations with smaller cations that leads to this rich structural and magnetic phase diagram . here , the structural changes are , therefore , the driving force behind the associated magnetic transitions and dimensional reductions .",
    "but these analyses of the microscopics of the fundamental crystal structures , rotations and hybridizations of the active bands at the fermi level , role of dynamic correlations on those bands , their single and two - particle ( vertex - corrected ) dynamic responses , allow us a fresh look into this important series with @xmath156 structure , the structural building block of another interesting unconventional superconducting series .",
    "the structural changes ,    the associated criticality , spin fluctuations and effective dimensional crossovers are used as fresh looking glasses into the iso - electronic series .",
    "however , it finally leads us to one interesting and relevant question : does the quantum critical end point of second - order structural transition lead to a quantum critical fan , much like what is realized in high @xmath18 unconventional superconductivity  @xcite or heavy fermion compounds  @xcite ? based on our analysis , we believe we have established a modified magnetic and electronic phase diagram for the series ( fig  [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "the paramagnetic bad metallic phase that emanates from this end point towards higher temperatures for all @xmath45 at and away from 0.5 , extends all the way to the right till @xmath14 and to the left till @xmath157 . at @xmath14 , above 25 k , the system is bad - metallic and at @xmath157 the system is again bad- metallic above 356 k. this leads us to infer that the critical fan would be the one connecting the end point ( @xmath133 ) to @xmath158 ( to the right ) and @xmath159 to the left .",
    "the iso - electronic material is a hund s metal inside this critical fan , and outside , it is a good metal ( fermi - liquid ) below 25 k at @xmath14 and a magnetic material ( either ferro or anti - ferro ) for @xmath155 .",
    "it is possible only at @xmath160 , that the @xmath132 good - metal of 2d nature without any magnetic ground state can be tuned through the @xmath13 critical end point at @xmath123 and made a magnetically ordered material ( metal and insulator respectively at @xmath161 and @xmath162 ) in the region @xmath155 . while our studies suggest that at finite temperatures @xmath163 a good metal for @xmath132 can be tuned inside the critical fan and made a hund s metal that finally crosses the other side of the fan at @xmath164 and becomes an antiferromagnetic insulator . from our analysis , a strictly local one , the aspects of local fluctuations , criticality",
    ", fermi liquidity and hund s metallicity can be well described .",
    "however , what it does not describe are non - local low energy fluctuations that may suppress the access to the @xmath165 critical end point .",
    "very recent experimental studies suggest that the @xmath165 point is cluster glass  @xcite , which is beyond the scope of our local analysis .",
    "that will lead to the modification of the phase diagram we have come up with , where the critical fan will end at the boundary of the cluster glass phase , and should not extend down to @xmath160 .",
    "however , inclusion of the cluster glass phase does not forbid the microscopics of the finite temperature aspects of criticality and the structure of the critical fan sustaining a hund s metallic phase .",

    "<S> the iso - electronic @xmath0 compounds of the @xmath1 series show rich phase diagrams due to competing spin , charge and orbital degrees of freedom in presence of strong correlations and structural distortions . </S>",
    "<S> one such iso - electronic series , @xmath2 , is studied within the gga ( and spin - orbit coupled gga ) plus dmft formalism using the hybridization expansion of exact low temperature continuous time quantum monte carlo impurity solver . while the local dynamical correlations make @xmath3 a hund s metal , they drive @xmath4 , the compound at the other end of the series , to a mott insulating ground state . </S>",
    "<S> we study the dynamic and static single - particle and local irreducible vertex - corrected two - particle responses across the series at three different points ( @xmath5 ) to understand the anomalous cross - over from hund s metal ( @xmath6 ) to a mott insulator ( @xmath7 ) and find that a structural distortion is likely to be responsible for the cross - over . </S>",
    "<S> further , dynamical correlations reveal that the band - width ( @xmath8 ) of the hund s metal is larger than its effective local hubbard @xmath9 , and a finite hund s coupling @xmath10 helps it remain in a bad metallic and nearly spin - frozen state over a large temperature range . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 , on the other hand , is intrinsically driven to the proximity of a mott transition due to narrowing of band width ( @xmath11 ) , though its finite temperature excitations indicate bad metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> we show that there is a critical end point of second - order structural transition at @xmath12 , where spin fluctuations become critically singular and follow the exact scaling of conformally invariant boundary field theory . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that this critical end point of quasi-@xmath13 nature is associated with an effective dimensional cross - over between the @xmath14 and @xmath15 quasi-@xmath16 structures . </S>",
    "<S> finally we draw a modified magnetic phase diagram of the material , showing a fan - like region starting from the quantum critical end point at @xmath17    materials with strong electronic correlations  @xcite can be realized in partially filled d- and f- electron systems . </S>",
    "<S> phenomena like mott metal - insulator ( mit ) transition  @xcite , unconventional high-@xmath18 superconductivity  @xcite , colossal magnetoresistance  @xcite are some of the dramatic ones that arise , solely or partly , due to strong local correlations and can fall in either of the effective single or multi - orbital frameworks depending on the active orbitals at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> correlated materials are realized in many partially filled d- and f- electron systems and the proximity of a mott transition makes some of these materials rather interesting . at the same time there are multi - orbital systems such as ruthenates  @xcite , iron pnictides  @xcite and chalcogenides  @xcite which are metals with strong correlations but are not at the border of a mott insulating phase . </S>",
    "<S> the role of hund s coupling  @xcite in single and two - particle responses in many such multi - orbital materials have now been extensively investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the hund s coupling leads to an exponential suppression of the coherence scale of a multi - orbital metal and leads to a large spin - frozen non fermi - liquid phase . </S>",
    "<S> hund s coupling has profound and distinct effects on spin , orbital and charge degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> nearly degenerate d - orbital systems away from half - filling are driven away from the mott transition as the hund s coupling prevents opening of a dynamical charge gap . </S>",
    "<S> these disparate , double - faced nature of hund s coupling in controlling the properties of a correlated metal earned considerable recent interest  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> ruthenates appear to be tailor - made for investigating the role of hund s coupling at and away from half - filling . </S>",
    "<S> being 4d - materials , they have less localization effects than their 3d - counterparts and are relatively less strongly correlated ( hubbard @xmath9 lesser than the bandwidth).this implies that they are relatively far from the mottness . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry of the ru @xmath19 orbitals favors a large hybridization with @xmath20 orbitals and leading to a large splitting between the @xmath19 and @xmath21 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> this , in turn , populates the 3 @xmath19 orbitals with 4 electrons and leads to a substantially lowered spin state than that of isoelectronic manganites . </S>",
    "<S> an extensive of study on the isoelectronic ruthenates , @xmath22  @xcite and @xmath23  @xcite , reveals that all of them can be regarded as prototypical examples of hund s metal with @xmath9 values substantially lesser than the respective bandwidths . </S>",
    "<S> all these systems , being away from half - filling , are driven far from the proximity of mott transitions by the hund s coupling @xmath10 . the role of van hove singularity and @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> have been extensively studied  @xcite in these compounds to rationalize their electronic and magnetic properties . </S>",
    "<S> reasonable values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 have been gleaned  @xcite on these materials from experimental single and two - particle features . </S>",
    "<S> the ground states and the finite temperature non - fermi - liquid states are described within three orbital lda+dmft framework with such values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> large mass enhancement factors  @xcite , substantial increment in the linear specific heat coefficient @xmath24 and absence of a mott insulating phase are common to all these three materials . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between them , however , concerns the nature of magnetic ground states and @xmath25-@xmath26-@xmath25 bond angles . </S>",
    "<S> the smaller @xmath27 ion leads to a larger rhombohedral distortion ( @xmath25-@xmath26-@xmath25 bond angle is 150 ) of the lattice than that of the rhombohedral @xmath28 structure of @xmath29 ( @xmath25-@xmath26-@xmath25 bond angle is 163 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bandwidth of @xmath30 reduces substantially and the density of states becomes less at the fermi level leading to a ( non - ferromagnetic ) magnetic ground state unlike @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> however , both these materials remain hund s metals . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 has no @xmath28 distortions with @xmath25-@xmath26-@xmath25 bond angle 180and is perfectly cubic .    </S>",
    "<S> this scenario , however , drastically changes for @xmath0 ruthenates , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . while @xmath3 is a @xmath31-wave superconductor at around 1.5k ( though contrary views appeared recently  @xcite ) and a hund s metal at low temperatures , becoming non - fermi - liquid above @xmath32=25k . </S>",
    "<S> the isoelectronic member at the other end of the series , @xmath4 , is a mott insulator with an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ground state for @xmath33 , a paramagnet state for @xmath34  @xcite and a bad metal above @xmath35  @xcite all the way up to @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies on @xmath3 have established the fact that it is non - fermi - liquid above 25k , with curie - weiss susceptibility , can be explained satisfactorily within hund s metal framework with @xmath37 and @xmath38  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while the hund s metal picture of this compound seems well settled , it fails in case of @xmath4  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath9 and @xmath10 values for this compound needs to be settled within an @xmath39 analysis by putting the single and two - particle responses to test against the experimental findings . at the same time it is interesting to investigate why , instead of having all the required features of being a tailor - made hund s metal ( finite and large @xmath40 , </S>",
    "<S> not half - filled ) , the system chooses to become a correlated ( mott ) metal . </S>",
    "<S> one relevant question is whether the smaller @xmath27 ions lead to a larger distortion of the octahedra . </S>",
    "<S> existing literatures suggest that the strong distortion of @xmath41 octahedra , associated with rotation , tilting and flattening respectively , drives the ferro- or anti - ferro - magnetic  @xcite nature of the ground states of @xmath2  @xcite and stabilizes them , while in case of @xmath30 the distortion is comparatively less because there is only one @xmath27 ion in the unit cell , instead of two for @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> but this  large distortion \" argument immediately raises questions : is there an effective dimensional cross - over across the series as one starts replacing @xmath42 by @xmath27 ? as we move across the series ( @xmath43 to @xmath44 ) , is some kind of quantum critical point encountered ? </S>",
    "<S> how do the local charge and spin fluctuations evolve across the series ? </S>",
    "<S> are they critical at any finite @xmath45 ? keeping these questions in mind , we would like to focus on the recently established magnetic phase diagram for the series  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our aim is to establish a modified magnetic and electronic phase diagram for the series , systematically analyzing the structural distortion , dimensional crossover , spin fluctuations and possible aspects of quantum criticality across this series . </S>",
    "<S> although substantial amount of experiments for probing charge , spin and orbital sectors across the phase diagram have been carried out , systematic theoretical studies are lacking . </S>",
    "<S> finally we perform a first - principles calculations ( gga and spin - orbit ( so ) coupled gga ) followed by dynamical mean field theory using state of the art  exact \" continuous time quantum monte - carlo ( ct - qmc ) impurity solver . </S>",
    "<S> we probe both single- and two - particle vertex - corrected static and dynamic responses for this series by using hybridization expansion of the ct - qmc solver . </S>",
    "<S> we first perform ab - initio density functional theory calculations within gga and gga+so for @xmath3 using the full potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( fp - lapw ) method as implemented in the wien2k code@xcite . at the outset </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the results from only gga calculations ( without so ) . </S>",
    "<S> we perform wannierization of the wien2k output bands around the fermi level via interface programs like wannier90  @xcite , wien2wannier  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this would , in turn , give us the wannier orbitals around the fermi level which serve as inputs of the dmft self - consistency calculation . </S>",
    "<S> similar procedure for the calculations are followed subsequently for @xmath46 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> however , so coupled gga is not be performed for these two compounds ( the explicit reason is discussed later ) . from the first - principles calculations , we would also try to address the role of van hove singularities , effective band widths of itinerant bands crossing the fermi level , and @xmath25-@xmath1 @xmath19-@xmath26-@xmath47 hybridization in tuning the local electronic and magnetic properties of this series . at the next level , using dmft , we rationalize our choices of @xmath9 and @xmath10 for different @xmath45 , and the role of local correlations in modifying the low energy single- and two - particle dynamic and static responses . </S>"
