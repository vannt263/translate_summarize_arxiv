    "@xcite , alday and maldacena have shown how to obtain the @xmath2-gluon scattering amplitude in @xmath0 sym in this framework , by finding a minimal surface , corresponding to a classical string solution , with polygonal boundary in @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , they have solved analytically the minimal surface problem in the four - gluon case  @xcite , so obtaining a fully analytic expression for the gluon - gluon elastic scattering amplitude .",
    "their method has been extended to quark - quark scattering in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these works , quarks are introduced as @xmath4 hypermultiplets on the field theory side , thus modifying the dynamical content of the theory , which requires the introduction of extra structure , namely d7-branes , in the dual gravitational description .",

    "i.e. _ , treating the quarks as external probes . in particular , the authors of ref .  @xcite obtain an exact solution to the minimal surface problem relevant to quark - quark elastic scattering , and although the area of the surface can not be expressed in closed form , an explicit expression can be obtained in the limit of small quark masses .",
    "a different method to compute scattering amplitudes through the ads / cft correspondence had been previously proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , in order to evaluate the high - energy scattering amplitude for external quarks .",
    "this method is based on the eikonal approximation and the wilson - line formalism for high - energy amplitudes  @xcite , and on analytic continuation to euclidean space  @xcite . in this case , no new dynamical degree of freedom is added on the field theory side , so that no extra structure has to be introduced in the dual gravitational description .",
    "quarks are treated directly from the onset as external particles coupled to the gauge ( and scalar ) fields of the @xmath5 theory . in this approach",
    ", the scattering amplitude is obtained from the correlation function of two wilson lines running along the eikonal trajectories of the quarks . through analytic continuation and gauge / gravity duality , this correlation function is related to the area of a minimal surface in euclidean @xmath1 ( _ i.e. _ , hyperbolic space ) , whose boundaries are two straight lines , corresponding to the euclidean trajectories of the quarks .",
    "the relevant minimal surface thus corresponds to a `` generalized helicoid ''  @xcite in the ads background , characterized by the impact - parameter distance between the quarks and by the opening angle @xmath6 of the boundary .",
    "after analytic continuation back into minkowski space , one obtains the impact - parameter amplitude at given high enough rapidity @xmath7 . however , the expressions obtained in @xcite were not complete , suffering from the lack of knowledge on the exact analytic form of the `` generalized helicoid '' .",
    "one goal of the present paper is to go further in the eikonal approach , in order to go beyond the approximations made in  @xcite , and so obtain a more refined result",
    ".    one major interest of the eikonal method is that it can be extended to non - conformal backgrounds  @xcite , corresponding to generic non - conformal gauge field theories , where using general features of gauge / gravity duality it leads in this case to regge amplitudes with linear trajectory .",
    "our aim in the present study is to look for regge behavior of amplitudes in the conformal case of @xmath0 sym by using this method .",
    "indeed , the high - energy behavior of scattering amplitudes has been analyzed for a long time in terms of regge amplitudes , both from the phenomenological and the theoretical point of view ( see _ e.g. _  ref .",
    "as it is well known , the regge behavior is a remarkable property of yang - mills theories in the perturbative regime .",
    "however , the issue of regge behavior of high - energy amplitudes at strong coupling requires different tools , and the ads / cft correspondence seems to be well suited for this purpose . in the case of gluon - gluon scattering ,",

    "this is very important in view of the application of the eikonal approach to qcd , where an analogue of the alday - maldacena approach is not currently available , and moreover allows to look at the universality problem in a different way .",

    "we will return on this point in the following .",
    "massive particles can be introduced in @xmath0 sym by breaking the @xmath91 symmetry to @xmath92 , which gives rise to massive @xmath93-bosons transforming in the fundamental representation of @xmath87 . on the gravity theory side , this can be accomplished by stretching one of the @xmath94 branes away from the others , and towards the boundary @xmath95 of euclidean @xmath1 .",

    "also in this case it is convenient to work directly in the limit @xmath102 , while at the same time regularizing the area ( in the uv ) by limiting the integration to the region @xmath103 .",
    "uv divergencies are dealt with by means of the legendre transform prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a remark is in order here .",
    "since we are considering heavy ( euclidean ) particles , the boundary conditions for the minimal surface in the supergravity description of the problem are naturally given at the uv , @xmath95 .",
    "this is in contrast with the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite , where such boundary conditions are given at the ir , @xmath104 , which is again natural for massless particles .",
    "one question we want to answer to is how the two points of view can be reconciled .",
    "let us note that while the computation of ref .",
    "@xcite is performed in minkowski space , here we are considering a calculation in euclidean space , from which the physical , minkowskian result for the scattering amplitude is recovered only after analytic continuation . in euclidean space ,",
    "the heavy @xmath93-boson is introduced only to establish a connection between the expectation value of the relevant wilson loops on the field theory side , and their dual description on the gravity side . in particular , the @xmath93-boson mass plays only the role of a uv regulator in the computation of the area of the relevant minimal surfaces , and drops from the wilson - loop expectation values after uv divergencies have been removed , _ before _ the analytic continuation . on the other hand ,",
    "the physical scattering amplitude depends on the mass @xmath62 of the minkowskian quarks ( and on @xmath8 ) only through the dependence of the relevant ( minkowskian ) wilson - loop expectation values on the hyperbolic angle @xmath7 . in other words ,",
    "the dependence on @xmath62 appears only when the relation between @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath62 is made explicit _",
    "after _ the analytic continuation .",
    "this shows that the mass of the euclidean ( heavy ) @xmath93-boson and the mass of the minkowskian quarks are completely unrelated .",
    "we see therefore that there is a natural connection between the use of very heavy particles in euclidean space , and the final goal of describing the scattering of particles with very high energy in minkowski space , the link being provided by the use of wilson loops and by the analytic continuation .",
    "we specialize now to the case of interest , _",
    "i.e. _ , the euclidean correlator @xmath74 .",
    "first of all , we notice that the normalisation factor reduces to @xmath89 , due to the legendre transform prescription  @xcite .",
    "this prescription implies also that the disconnected contributions to the expectation values on the right hand side of eqs .   and",
    "is 1 , and therefore gets cancelled .",
    "next , since the connected part of @xmath105 is related to a minimal surface with tube topology , we have that @xmath106 , and so the amplitude is dominated by the `` octet '' component @xmath107 , which is of order @xmath108 : indeed , the relevant minimal surface in eq .",
    "has disk topology , so that the right hand side is of order 1 . finally , we obtain at large @xmath109 @xmath110 where the subscript @xmath111 stands for the connected component .",
    "the basic building block of the construction is therefore a minimal surface in anti - de sitter space , which is bounded by two oriented straight lines at the boundary @xmath95 of @xmath1 , corresponding to the trajectories of the two heavy euclidean quarks in the static ( infinite mass ) limit .",
    "we call this surface a `` generalized helicoid '' .    in order to properly define the variational problem , it is convenient to take the two lines to have infinite length , while at the same time introducing a new ir cutoff to regularize the area of the resulting minimal surface . in practice ,",
    "the boundary is defined by the two straight lines for the coordinates of points in euclidean space . ]",
    "@xmath112 traveled from @xmath113 to @xmath114 , separated by a distance @xmath57 in the `` transverse '' direction @xmath115 , and forming a relative angle @xmath6 in the `` longitudinal '' plane @xmath116 ( see [ figquarkpara ] ) . on the other hand , since the area functional @xmath117 with the boundary at @xmath95 is expected to be infinite due to ir divergences , is also uv divergent due to the behavior of the metric near the boundary @xmath95 , the divergence taking the form @xmath118 .",
    "this is precisely the area of two planar `` walls '' , extending along the wilson lines and in the fifth dimension of ads , which is subtracted from the minimal area when using the legendre prescription of ref .",
    "we limit the range of @xmath119 to @xmath120 $ ] , understanding that it has to be imposed in the computation of the area , and not in the determination of the minimal surface .",
    "the regularized ( and uv - subtracted ) area of the surface minimizing the functional is therefore a function @xmath121 , which enters the color - independent part of the euclidean `` amplitude '' , defined in eq .",
    ", as @xmath122 $ ]",
    ". this function will be defined more precisely in section 5.1 .",
    "the case of quark - antiquark scattering is obtained by simply flipping the orientation of one of the two straight lines , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath123 with @xmath119 running again from @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "this corresponds to changing the representation of the corresponding wilson line from fundamental to anti - fundamental , as appropriate for an antiquark . in turn , exploiting the euclidean symmetries , it is easy to see that this is equivalent to the change @xmath124 in the relative angle .",
    "the minimal surface relevant to quark - antiquark scattering is therefore obtained by minimizing @xmath125 , and thus it is equal to @xmath126 , so that the two cases can be treated at once .    in the case of the @xmath9 background one",
    "does not know yet the minimal surface corresponding to the boundaries .",
    "a simple scheme has been introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the following ans \" atz for the `` generalized helicoid '' is assumed in order to find the minimal solution , @xmath127 the world - sheet coordinates @xmath128 are in the range , @xmath129 $ ] and @xmath130 $ ] . using this ans \" atz ,",
    "the regularized area functional becomes @xmath131 where the ir cutoff parameter @xmath60 is introduced , as explained above .",
    "we remark here that the ans \" atz is appropriate for quark - antiquark scattering , that is , for the correlator @xmath132 , rather than for quark - quark scattering .",
    "the reason is that if we want an orientable surface , the two straight - lines which form the boundary of the helicoid have to be travelled in opposite directions , if the surface performs a twist of angle @xmath6 . on the other hand ,",
    "if they are travelled in the same direction , the helicoid has to perform a twist of angle @xmath133 in order to obtain an orientable surface .",

    "nevertheless , as explained above , the geometrical problem to be solved in euclidean space is the same for quark - quark and quark - antiquark scattering .",
    "the difference between the two cases lies in the specific analytic continuation which one has to make in order to obtain the physical amplitude .",
    "we conclude this section with a brief description of the treatment of gluon - gluon scattering in the eikonal method .",

    "one of the main differences between the two methods described in the previous section is that the boundaries of the relevant minimal surfaces are given in the minkowskian ir region , in the alday - maldacena case , and in the euclidean uv region , in the case of the eikonal approach .",

    "<S> the high - energy behavior of @xmath0 sym elastic amplitudes at strong coupling is studied by means of the ads / cft correspondence . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the eikonal method proposed by janik and one of the authors , where the relevant minimal surface is a `` generalized helicoid '' in hyperbolic space ( `` euclidean @xmath1 '' ) , from which the physical amplitude is obtained after an appropriate analytic continuation . </S>",
    "<S> we then compare our results with those obtained , using a minimal surface in @xmath1 momentum space , by alday and maldacena for gluon - gluon scattering , and by barnes and vaman for quark - quark scattering ( `` alday - maldacena approach '' ) . exploiting a conformal transformation , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the eikonal amplitudes are dominated by the euclidean version of the cusp contribution found in the alday - maldacena approach . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes in the two approaches are of regge type at high - energy and with the same logarithmic regge trajectory independently of the kind of colliding particles , in agreement with the expected universality of regge trajectories .    </S>",
