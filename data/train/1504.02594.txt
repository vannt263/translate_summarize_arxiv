    "in the progress of experimental researches on proton - rich nuclei , the interest of proton and neutron @xmath17 pair correlations has been revived in these years . in the study of @xmath1 pairing ,",
    "the competition between isoscalar @xmath9 pairing and isovector @xmath10 pairing is one of the essential problems in @xmath18 nuclei @xcite .",
    "the nuclear interaction in a free space is more attractive in the @xmath9 spin - triplet even ( @xmath19e ) channel than in the @xmath10 spin - singlet even ( @xmath20e ) channel as known from the bound state , deuteron , formed by two nucleons in the @xmath19e channel .",
    "however , at the nuclear surface and in nuclear medium , the competition between @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath1 pairs occurs . because of the stronger @xmath19e interaction than the @xmath20e interaction",
    ", it is naively expected that the deuteron - like @xmath9 pair is more favored than the @xmath10 pair as seen in the ground state spin , @xmath21 , of @xmath22li and @xmath23f .",
    "however , the @xmath10 pair is often favored rather than the @xmath9 pair in medium- and heavy - mass regions as seen in the ground state spins of @xmath24odd nuclei because the spin - orbit mean potential favors the @xmath10 pair @xcite .",
    "moreover , the spin - orbit potential favors a spin - aligned @xmath9 @xmath1 pair @xcite .",
    "these facts indicate that the spin - orbit interaction plays an important role in the competition between @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath1 pairs in nuclear systems .",

    ", one can discuss the competition between @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath1 pairs from the ordering of @xmath21 and @xmath15 states .",
    "for example , @xmath26li and @xmath23f have the @xmath21 ground states and the @xmath27 excited states indicating that the @xmath9 pair is favored rather than the @xmath10 pair . on the other hand , in @xmath28sc ,",
    "the ground state is @xmath27 because the @xmath10 pair is favored by the spin - orbit potential at the surface of the @xmath29ca core as discussed by tanimura _",
    "based on a three - body model calculation @xcite .    in the previous paper @xcite ,",
    "two of the authors , kanada - enyo and kobayashi , discussed effects of the spin - orbit interaction on @xmath1 pairs at the surface of @xmath30o in @xmath23f based on an @xmath30o+@xmath1 model , and found that the level structure of @xmath21 , @xmath15 , and @xmath31 states is affected by the strength of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "namely , the spin - orbit interaction reduces the @xmath10 pair energy in the @xmath15 state , and it largely contributes to the energy of a spin - aligned @xmath9 @xmath1 pair attractively to lower the @xmath31 energy , whereas it gives a minor effect to the @xmath9 pair energy in the @xmath14 state .    in @xmath0b ,",

    "recently , kohno pointed out that the @xmath7 force provides an attractive contribution to the effective two - body spin - orbit interaction in nuclear medium @xcite .",

    ", we investigate structure of @xmath0b and clarify effects of the spin - orbit interaction on @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath1 pairs based on the calculation of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) @xcite using phenomenological effective nuclear interactions .",
    "the amd method is a model for structure studies and has been proved to be one of the successful methods for light nuclei , in particular , to describe cluster structures of ground and excited states .",
    "for instance , @xmath33 cluster structures of neutron - rich be isotopes are described systematically with the amd calculations @xcite .",

    "we apply the method of the variation after parity and total - angular - momentum projections of the amd model ( amd+vap ) @xcite to obtain @xmath40-nucleon wave functions for the ground and excited states of a nucleus with the mass number @xmath40 .",
    "we here briefly explain the formulation of the present amd calculation .",
    "an amd wave function is given by a slater determinant , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the antisymmetrizer , and the @xmath43th single - particle wave function is written by a product of spatial(@xmath44 ) , intrinsic spin(@xmath45 ) and isospin(@xmath46 ) wave functions as @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath45 are spatial and spin functions , respectively , and @xmath46 is the isospin function fixed to be up ( proton ) or down ( neutron ) .",
    "accordingly , an amd wave function is expressed by a set of variational parameters , @xmath49 , which specify centroids of single - nucleon gaussian wave packets and spin orientations for all nucleons .",
    "the parameters @xmath50 are determined by the energy variation after parity and total - angular - momentum projections to obtain the optimized amd wave function .",

    "in the amd framework , existence of clusters is not assumed _ a priori _ because gaussian centroids @xmath51 of all single - nucleon wave packets are independently treated as variational parameters .",
    "nevertheless , if the system energetically favors a specific cluster structure such the structure is obtained in the energy variation because the amd model space contains wave functions for various cluster structures .",
    "therefore , the amd method is suitable to investigate whether the clusters are formed or not in the system .",
    "note that the amd wave function is similar to the wave function used in fermionic molecular dynamics calculations @xcite , though some differences exist in width parameters of single - nucleon gaussian wave packets and the variational procedure .",

    "we showed that the change @xmath132 mev of the spin - orbit interaction in the present effective two - body interactions gives effects quite similar to the contribution of the @xmath7 force in the ncsm calculation on the low - lying spectra of @xmath0b and @xmath26li .",

    "the spin - orbit interaction affects the @xmath13 pair attractively and suppresses the spatial development of the pair , whereas , in the @xmath14 state , it gives a minor effect to the @xmath13 pair .",

    ", we use the phenomenological effective two - body central and spin - orbit interactions , which are adjusted so as to describe the @xmath11-@xmath11 scattering and the @xmath111 splitting in @xmath78be .",
    "the present interactions have no direct link to the bare nuclear force although the contributions from the @xmath7 force as well as the tensor force and also many - body effects in nuclear systems should be indirectly contained in the effective interactions . in the present paper ,",
    "we associate a contribution of the @xmath7 force with a part of the effective two - body spin - orbit interaction with the help of the g - matrix calculation by kohno .",
    "it is a remaining future problem to adopt more sophisticated effective interactions derived from bare nuclear forces and investigate effects of the @xmath7 force on the @xmath1 correlations in @xmath25 nuclei .",
