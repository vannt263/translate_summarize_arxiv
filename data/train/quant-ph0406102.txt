    "the field of quadrature squeezing saw its main period of growth in the 1980 s @xcite .",
    "the topic continues to be important to many areas of research involving nonclassical light and its applications @xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss one of the earliest and most fundamental issues addressed in this field : the detection of quadrature squeezed light and the characterization of squeezing as a nonclassical effect .",
    "the standard squeezing measurement uses balanced homodyne detection @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "nonclassical squeezing is identified with a reduction of the measured noise variance below the shot noise level .",
    "the noise variance depends on the phase of the local oscillator , in such a way that the reduction evolves into an enhancement as the phase is continuously changed . in this standard measurement",
    "the shot noise level is the `` measuring stick '' , used to differentiate quantum from classical squeezing in a quantitative way .",
    "considered for the qualitative response only , the two types of squeezing appear in the same way . in either case",
    ", one observes a phase - sensitive reduction of the noise variance over a limited bandwidth ; as stated , the distinction made is purely quantitative : a reduction below the shot noise level is a quantum effect , otherwise the squeezing is classical .",
    "there is nothing particularly curious in this .",
    "other instances exist in quantum optics where nonclassicality is defined by the violation of a quantitative bound ; one might prefer that the bound be a relative measure  a fringe visibility , for example ; on the other hand , there is no reason to doubt that the shot noise level can be reliably set .    at a more fundamental level , however , it does seem reasonable to expect that the difference between quantum and classical noise would amount to something more than the mere _ size _ of a noise variance .",
    "if , after all , that is the only distinction , the natural conclusion is that quantum and classical fluctuations are qualitatively the same .",
    "classical noise models , such as stochastic electrodynamics , should then be adequate to account for quantum noise .",
    "we show in this paper that in the case of quadrature squeezing the expected qualitative difference does exist .",
    "it is revealed by a measurement based on _ conditional _ homodyne detection @xcite .",
    "our proposal is not the first to make a qualitative distinction between classical and quantum squeezing , since such differences also appear in the response of atoms illuminated by squeezed light @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this earlier work , however , our proposal makes the distinction at the level of an elementary squeezing measurement .    in section [ sec : squeezing ] we review the theoretical treatment of quadrature squeezing of broadband classical noise and its extension to the quantum case via the wigner representation .",
    "section [ sec : detection ] discusses the detection of squeezed light , and contrasts nonconditional and conditional homodyne detection schemes .",
    "the implications of the demonstrated qualitative difference between quantum and classical squeezing for the realistic interpretation of vacuum fluctuations ( stochastic electrodynamics ) is discussed in section [ sec : stochastic_electrodynamics ] .",
    "brief conclusions are then drawn in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "quadrature squeezing is commonly understood as a property of the electromagnetic field , without referring to how that property will be measured .",
    "this way of thinking is certainly unproblematic so far as squeezed classical noise is concerned .",
    "we therefore begin from this point of view and review the well - known results for the quadrature squeezing of a broadband classical noise field , @xmath0 in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] , injected into the input of a below - threshold degenerate parametric oscillator ( dpo ) .",
    "the squeezing observed at the output is readily understood by considering how @xmath1 is formed from the interference of @xmath0 with the partial transmission , through the output mirror , of the intracavity field @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the squeezing may be calculated in the following straightforward way .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     -0.2 in    simulated results for @xmath3 are presented in figure  [ fig : fig7 ] .",
    "they are in qualitative agreement with figure  [ fig : fig5 ] ; although all is not well at a quantitative level ; there is a difference in both the absolute and relative sizes of the squeezing dips .",
    "this comes from the inevitable difficulties faced by stochastic electrodynamics .",
    "a problem arises due to the presence in @xmath4 of a nonphysical vacuum field photon flux proportional to the filter bandwidth @xmath5i.e .",
    ", nonphysical dark counts at the `` start '' detector .",
    "if we are prepared to set this inevitable problem aside , however , stochastic electrodynamics provides an alternative explanation for the elimination of the shot noise spike .",
    "we have compared conditional and nonconditional measurements of quadrature squeezing and shown that conditional detection distinguishes _ qualitatively _ between quantum and classical squeezing .",
    "we showed that both measurements may be understood at a superficial level by adding realistic vacuum fluctuations to asymptotic input fields ( stochastic electrodynamics ) .",
    "the strategy is unable to offer a plausible treatment of photoelectric detection , however , and this leads to serious quantitative errors in the treatment of the conditional measurement .",
