    "over the last few years the detection of several giant air showers , either through ground based detectors  @xcite or fluorescence telescopes  @xcite , has confirmed the arrival of ultra high energy cosmic - rays ( uhecrs ) with energies up to a few hundred eev ( 1 eev @xmath6ev ) .",
    "their existence poses a serious challenge and is currently subject of much theoretical research as well as experimental efforts ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "the problems encountered in trying to explain uhecrs in terms of `` bottom - up '' acceleration mechanisms have been well - documented in a number of studies ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in summary ,",
    "apart from the specific energy draining interactions in the source the maximal uhecr energy is limited by the product of the accelerator size and the strength of the magnetic field . according to this criterion it turns out that it is very hard to accelerate protons and heavy nuclei up to the observed energies , even for the most powerful astrophysical objects such as radio galaxies and active galactic nuclei .",
    "in addition , nucleons above @xmath7eev suffer heavy energy losses due to photo - pion production on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) effect  @xcite  which limits the distance to possible sources to less than @xmath8mpc  @xcite .",
    "heavy nuclei at these energies are photo - disintegrated in the cmb within a few mpc  @xcite . unless the sources are strongly clustered in our local cosmic environment , a drop , often called the `` gzk cut - off '' in the spectrum above @xmath7eev is therefore expected  @xcite , even if the injection spectra extend to much higher energies .",
    "however , the existence of the latter is not established yet from the observations  @xcite .",
    "in fact , whereas a cut - off seems consistent with the few events above @xmath9ev recorded by the fluorescence detector hires  @xcite , it is not compatible with the 8 events ( also above @xmath9ev ) measured by the agasa ground array  @xcite .",
    "the solution of this problem may have to await the completion of the pierre auger project  @xcite which will combine the two complementary detection techniques adopted by the aforementioned experiments .",
    "adding to the problem , there are no obvious astronomical counterparts to the detected uhecr events within @xmath10mpc of the earth  @xcite . at the same time , no significant large - scale anisotropy has been observed in uhecr arrival directions above @xmath11ev , whereas there are strong hints for small - scale clustering : the agasa experiment has observed five doublets and one triplet within @xmath12 out of a total of 57 events detected above 40 eev  @xcite .",
    "when combined with three other ground array experiments , these numbers increase to at least eight doublets and two triplets within @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "this clustering has a chance probability of less than @xmath14 in the case of an isotropic distribution .",
    "independent of the specific uhecr production mechanism , there are currently two possible explanations of the experimental findings described above : the first assumes very weak intergalactic magnetic fields capable of deflecting uhecrs only up to a few degrees , or neutral primaries . in this case",
    "the apparent isotropy would indicate that many sources contribute to the observed flux and most of these sources would be at cosmological distances because the local source distribution is in general too anisotropic to be consistent with the observed uhecr isotropy .",
    "this would also explain the absence of nearby counterparts and a subset of especially powerful sources would explain the small - scale clustering  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been argued that uhecr arrival directions correlate with the positions of bl lacertae objects , suggesting these as sources accelerating protons  @xcite , although there seems to be disagreement about this in the literature  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some of these objects may be too far away to be consistent with the gzk effect , which would require new physics such as lorentz symmetry violations  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , correlations with compact radio quasars have not been found  @xcite .",
    "if correlations with astrophysical objects are confirmed , this would strongly suggest small deflection or neutral primary particles .",
    "whatever the sources are in this scenario , for small deflection one can in principle constrain the characteristics of the magnetic fields along the line of sight and the source properties by analysing arrival times , directions , and energies of observed small - scale multi - plets  @xcite .",
    "also , in the small deflection scenario the experimental confirmation of a gzk cutoff is expected",
    ".    however , the assumption of weak intergalactic magnetic fields seems at odds with several observations  @xcite .",
    "most remarkable are the detections of faraday rotation measures which seem to indicate field strengths at the @xmath15 g level within the inner region ( @xmath16 central mpc ) of galaxy clusters  @xcite . in addition",
    ", the recent mounting evidence for diffuse radio - synchrotron emission in numerous galaxy clusters @xcite and in a few cases of filaments @xcite , seems to suggest the presence of magnetic fields as strong as 0.1 - 1.0@xmath15 g at the relatively low density outskirts of collapsed cosmological structures .",
    "in fact , extragalactic magnetic fields ( egmf ) as strong as @xmath17 in sheets and filaments of the large scale galaxy distribution , such as in our local supercluster , are compatible with existing upper limits on faraday rotation  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that fossil cocoons of former radio galaxies , so called radio ghosts , contribute to the isotropization of uhecr arrival directions  @xcite .",
    "thus , relatively strong magnetic fields seem to be ubiquitous in intergalactic space , although their theoretical understanding is still limited  @xcite .",
    "such observational evidence motivates a second , more realistic scenario , which takes into account the existence of strong ( @xmath18 g ) intergalactic magnetic fields correlated with the large scale structure . in this case",
    "magnetic deflection of charged primaries would be considerable even at the highest energies and the observed uhecr flux could be dominated by relatively few sources within about 100 mpc . here , large scale isotropy could be explained by considerable angular deflection leading to diffusion up to almost the highest energies and the small scale clustering could be due to magnetic lensing  @xcite . the locations of clusters of events of different energies would in this case",
    "coincide with the crossing points of the caustics for these energies where fluxes are enhanced .    in the present paper",
    "we take this second point of view and investigate in some detail the effects of propagation of uhecrs , assumed to be dominantly nucleons , in a magnetized large scale structure matter distribution computed according to a numerical cosmological simulation .",
    "early investigations of this scenario have been carried out in refs .",
    "@xcite , assuming that sources and magnetic fields follow a pancake profile of scale height @xmath19mpc and scale length @xmath20mpc , the magnetic field having a power law spectrum at length scales below @xmath21mpc .",
    "uhecr propagation was computed through a numerical code that accounts for magnetically induced deflections and all relevant energy losses  @xcite .",
    "the cases of a single source  @xcite , as well as continuous  @xcite and discrete source distributions  @xcite have been investigated .",
    "the above studies led to the result that the multi - pole moments and autocorrelation functions of the arrival directions best fit the agasa data for a number @xmath2210 sources in the local supercluster , assumed to emit continuously , and a maximal field strength of @xmath23 g  @xcite .",
    "ideally , however , it would be desirable to study the propagation of uhecrs based on distributions of both potential sources and observed magnetic field properties .",
    "however , up to now , only catalogs of candidate sources have been available .",
    "magnetic fields , on the other hand , have been approximated in a number of fashions : as negligible  @xcite , as uniform  @xcite , or as organized in spatial cells with a given coherence length and a strength depending as a power law on the local density  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we attempt to go beyond some of the above limitations by computing for the first time the propagation of the uhecrs in a magnetized cosmological environment computed through numerical simulations .",
    "we carry out a fully cosmological simulation of large scale structure formation which , in addition to dark matter and baryonic gas , follows the evolution of a passive magnetic field .",
    "this approach is motivated by the fact that @xmath15 g magnetic fields are mostly negligible for the purpose of the dynamics of the large scale cosmic flows ( hence their passive character ) .",
    "in addition , and basically for the same reason , the structure of magnetic fields on scales of interest for uhecr propagation ( @xmath22 100 kpc ) is mostly determined by the hydrodynamic flow .",
    "this is confirmed by the fact that in these simulations , the magnetic field looses memory of its initial conditions , soon after the formation of structures begins",
    ". finally , the statistical properties of cosmological structure in the universe are rather homogeneous .",
    "therefore , the simulated matter structure and magnetic field distributions should provide a realistic scenario for studying the statistical properties of uhecr source distributions and propagation in a cosmic environment . in the present study",
    "we assume the sources to follow the baryon density .",
    "furthermore , the observer is supposed to be in regions of the simulated matter distribution which contain structures of the same size and baryonic gas temperature as our local neighborhood .",
    "this should provide a suitable environment to simulate the arrival of uhecrs from extragalactic distances and the effects of local magnetic fields of various strengths .    in the future such studies",
    "can be further improved by computing _ constrained",
    "_ simulations that reproduce in detail the observed matter distribution of the local universe . such a simulation has been used for the case of radio ghosts in ref .",
    "@xcite where , however , the magnetic fields were not followed but were rather assumed to scale with the gas density . constrained simulations including magnetic fields are relevant for predicting quantitative features such as location of clustered events , phases of anisotropies etc . and will be used in a following study .",
    "we point out , however , that for the reasons given above , effects of the magnetic field and source distributions in the local universe should essentially be captured by the present approach at least up to `` cosmic variance '' .",
    "the latter represents variations due to different source and observer locations and will be estimated in our simulations .",
    "we also restrict ourselves to uhecr nucleons , and we neglect the galactic contribution to the deflection of uhecr nucleons since typical proton deflection angles in galactic magnetic fields of several @xmath15 g are @xmath24 above @xmath1ev  @xcite , and thus in general are small compared to extra - galactic deflection in the scenarios studied in the present paper .    the simulation is described in more detail in the next section .",
    "there we also describe the general features of our method and define the statistical quantities used for comparison with the data . in sect .  3 we present results and we conclude in sect .  4 .",
    "contrary to the case of electrons , for charged hadrons deflection is more important than synchrotron loss in the egmf . to get an impression of typical deflection angles one can characterize the egmf by its r.m.s .",
    "strength @xmath25 and a coherence length @xmath26 .",
    "if we neglect energy loss processes for the moment , then the r.m.s .",
    "deflection angle over a distance @xmath27 in such a field is @xmath28  @xcite , where the larmor radius of a particle of charge @xmath29 and energy @xmath30 is @xmath31 . in numbers",
    "this reads @xmath32 for @xmath27 .",
    "this expression makes it immediately obvious why a magnetized local supercluster with fields of fractions of micro gauss prevents a direct assignment of sources in the arrival directions of observed uhecrs ; the deflection expected is many tens of degrees even at the highest energies .",
    "this goes along with a time delay @xmath33 which may be millions of years .",
    "a source visible in uhecrs today could therefore be optically invisible since many models involving , for example , active galaxies as uhecr accelerators , predict variability on much shorter time scales .",
    "the formation and evolution of the large scale structure is computed by means of an eulerian , grid based total - variation - diminishing hydro+n - body code @xcite .",
    "we adopt a canonical , flat @xmath34cdm cosmological model with a total mass density @xmath35 and a vacuum energy density @xmath36 .",
    "we assume a normalized hubble constant @xmath37 km s@xmath38 mpc@xmath38 = 1 and a baryonic mass density , @xmath39 .",
    "the simulation is started at redshift @xmath40 with initial density perturbations generated as a gaussian random field and characterized by a power spectrum with a spectral index @xmath41 and `` cluster - normalization '' @xmath42 .",
    "we adopt a computational box size of @xmath43mpc . in this box",
    "the dark matter component is described by 256@xmath44 particles whereas the gas component is evolved on a comoving grid of 512@xmath44 zones .",
    "thus each numerical cell measures about @xmath45kpc ( comoving ) and each dark matter particle corresponds to @xmath46 . besides the box and dark matter particle sizes the cosmological simulation is the same as that presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "mpc on each side and @xmath45kpc deep .",
    "the small white dot in the bottom panel indicates the location of the observer . for visualization purposes we adopt a dynamic range of 3 and 6 orders of magnitude for the magnetic pressure and baryon density , respectively.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the magnetic field",
    "is followed as a passive quantity , that is magnetic forces are neglected .",
    "this is consistent with the strength of observed magnetic fields in most diffuse extragalactic environments .",
    "basically we solve the induction equation with the velocity field provided by the simulated flow @xcite and the initial magnetic field seeds generated by the biermann battery mechanism .",
    "however , as already pointed out , the initial conditions are not important as the topological properties of the magnetic field are determined by the subsequent evolution of the large scale flow .",
    "this is responsible for its amplification through gas compression and shear flows .",
    "thus , at the end of the simulation , the relative strength of the magnetic field in different regions is determined by the hydrodynamic properties of the flow .",
    "while the simulation outcome regarding the _ relative _ magnetic field strength and topology distribution are obviously retained , the overall normalization is chosen in order to reproduce the fields of several micro gauss observed in the regions of largest density , namely galaxy cluster cores .",
    "[ fig1 ] illustrates an example of the simulated magnetic pressure ( top ) and baryonic density ( bottom ) distributions .",
    "the figure shows two - dimensional cuts corresponding to a depth of @xmath45kpc .",
    "the color images are in log scale and , for visualization purposes , span a dynamic range of 3 and 6 orders of magnitude for magnetic pressure and baryonic density respectively .",
    "the magnetic field is particularly strong in both postshock regions and inside relatively large structures where it has been compressed and stretched .",
    "apparently , its distribution is less concentrated than the baryonic density , resembling in this respect that of the thermal pressure ( not shown ) .      to simulate the propagation and arrival of uhecrs in the computational box we need to choose : ( a ) the location of the observer and ( b ) the source distribution .",
    "as anticipated in the introduction , the location of the observer is identified as a region whose general features in terms of scale , mass and temperature , resemble those of the local universe .",
    "that means a small group of galaxies characterized by a gas temperature of order of a fraction of a kev .",
    "there are several such structures in a @xmath43mpc box such as the one employed here . in the neighborhood of the one we selected as the observer location",
    ", we also find a larger group of galaxies with temperature of a few kev . in order to orient the simulation box with respect to the observed sky , the latter object , located at a distance of @xmath22 34 mpc ,",
    "is arbitrarily associated with the virgo cluster .",
    "this reference frame allows us to define a celestial system of coordinates @xmath47 which describes the arrival direction of events recorded by our virtual observer .",
    "it will be useful in the next section where the arrival direction probability distribution is constructed .",
    "the above setting is sufficient for the current purpose of investigating the effects on the propagation of uhecrs of realistic , topologically structured magnetic fields of various strengths .",
    "we then chose randomly a certain total number @xmath48 of sources in the box , corresponding to an average source density @xmath49 , with probability proportional to the local baryon density . in order to avoid introducing too many free parameters",
    ", we further assume that all sources roughly emit the same power law spectrum of crs extending up to @xmath50ev , with roughly equal total power .",
    "we also assume that neither total power nor the power law spectral index change significantly on the time scale of uhecr propagation .",
    "this can be up to a few giga years for the magnetic fields considered here .",
    "injected power and spectral index are then treated as parameters which can be fit to reproduce the observed spectrum , as will be seen below .    for each such configuration",
    "many nucleon trajectories originating from the sources were computed numerically by solving the equation of motion for the lorentz force and checking for pion production every fraction of a mpc according to the total interaction rate with the cmb and , in case of an interaction , by randomly selecting the secondary energies according to the differential cross section .",
    "pair production by protons is treated as a continuous energy loss process .",
    "a detection event was registered and its arrival directions and energies recorded each time the trajectory of the propagating particle crossed a sphere of radius 1 mpc around the observer . for each configuration",
    "this was done until 5000 events where registered . for more details on this method",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite .      for each realization of sources and observer ,",
    "these events were used to construct arrival direction probability distributions , taking into account the solid - angle dependent exposure function for the respective experiment and folding over the angular resolution .    for the exposure function",
    "@xmath51 we use the parameterization of ref .",
    "@xcite which depends only on declination @xmath52 , @xmath53 for the agasa experiment @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and the angular resolution @xmath56 are used .",
    "for a full - sky pierre auger type experiment we add the exposures for the southern auger site with @xmath54 and a putative similar northern site with @xmath57 , and @xmath55 in both cases , with an assumed angular resolution of @xmath58 .    from the distributions obtained in this way",
    "typically 1000 mock data sets consisting of @xmath59 observed events were selected randomly .",
    "for each such mock data set or for the real data set we then obtained estimators for the spherical harmonic coefficients @xmath60 and the autocorrelation function @xmath61 .",
    "the estimator for @xmath60 is defined as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the total experimental exposure at arrival direction @xmath64 , @xmath65 is the sum of the weights @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is the real - valued spherical harmonics function taken at direction @xmath64 . the estimator for @xmath61 is defined as @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the solid angle size of the corresponding bin . in eq .",
    "( [ auto ] ) the normalization factor @xmath70 , with @xmath71 denoting the solid angle of the sky region where the experiment has non - vanishing exposure , is chosen such that an isotropic distribution corresponds to @xmath72 .",
    "the different mock data sets in the various realizations yield the statistical distributions of @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "one defines the average over all mock data sets and realizations as well as two errors",
    ". the smaller error ( shown to the left of the average in the figures below ) is the statistical error , i.e. the fluctuations due to the finite number @xmath59 of observed events , averaged over all realizations",
    ". the larger error ( shown to the right of the average in the figures below ) is the `` total error '' , i.e. the statistical error plus the cosmic variance .",
    "thus , the latter includes the fluctuations due to finite number of events and the variation between different realizations of observer and source positions .",
    "given a set of observed and simulated events , after extracting some useful statistical quantities @xmath73 , namely @xmath74 and @xmath61 defined above , we define @xmath75 where @xmath76 refers to @xmath73 obtained from the real data , and @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the average and standard deviations of the simulated data sets .",
    "this measure of deviation from the average prediction can be used to obtain an overall likelihood for the consistency of a given theoretical model with an observed data set by counting the fraction of simulated data sets with @xmath79 larger than the one for the real data .",

    "[ fig9 ] shows the multi - poles predicted by our standard scenario 1 in tab .",
    "[ tab ] that full - sky experiment would observe for 1500 events detected above @xmath0ev .",
    "this corresponds to twice the number of currently observed agasa events and thus approximately reflects the current exposure .",
    "a corresponding figure for the agasa detector alone would look similar .",
    "it is obvious that there is significant anisotropy even at @xmath125 , inconsistent with current agasa observations . on the other hand ,",
    "cosmic variance becomes more important at these lower energies , and a possible significant contribution from large - distance sources can not be excluded if their magnetization is not too high , as discussed above .",
    "it is easy to see from eq .",
    "( [ cl ] ) that if a fraction @xmath126 of @xmath59 events observed stems from an anisotropic , local contribution , whereas the fraction @xmath127 is cosmological and completely isotropic , then @xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the expectation values of @xmath74 for the isotropic and the anisotropic distribution , respectively . therefore , at @xmath4ev an isotropic cosmological flux about a factor 3 higher than the anisotropic flux originating within @xmath131mpc would be needed to explain the isotropy observed by agasa . for charged primaries",
    "this implies steep injection spectra and/or weak magnetic fields around observer and sources , as explained above . without going into a more detailed analysis",
    "we remark that this will also require to decrease the flux contribution from nearby sources shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] at the low energy end . as a consequence , the best fit injection spectrum for",
    "the local component will be slightly harder than the power law indices shown in tab .",
    "this is consistent with what is expected from shock acceleration theory  @xcite .    , but for @xmath132 events observed above 10 eev.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in the present work we performed uhecr propagation simulations based on the distributions of magnetic field and baryon density obtained from a simulation of large scale structure formation .",
    "the magnetic field was simulated as a passive quantity and normalized at simulation end in agreement with published measurements of faraday rotation measures for groups and clusters of galaxies  @xcite .",
    "we considered finite numbers of discrete uhecr sources with equal total power and injection spectrum .",
    "their positions were randomly selected with probability proportional to the baryon density .",
    "the observer was chosen within small groups of galaxies characterized by gas temperatures around a fraction of a kev , typical for our local environment .",
    "one chosen observer was found in a relatively high field region with @xmath108 g . for comparison , we also chose an observer situated in a small void , where the surrounding field is @xmath133 g .",
    "we found that good fits to the agasa data above @xmath1ev in the northern hemisphere are only obtained for @xmath98 sources and for observers surrounded by @xmath2 g fields .",
    "otherwise the predicted arrival direction distribution is either too anisotropic or produces too large auto - correlations at angles larger than a few degrees .",
    "the best fit case occurs for @xmath134 , significantly higher than in previous work  @xcite due to the more localized and more strongly structured magnetic fields considered here .    for the required local source number density and continuous power per source we find @xmath135 , and @xmath136 respectively , the latter within about one order of magnitude uncertainty to both sides",
    "this corresponds to an average uhecr emissivity of @xmath137 also with an uncertainty of roughly one order of magnitude , not larger , since it is fixed by the observed uhecr flux .",
    "possible sources marginally consistent with these energy requirements are radio galaxies .",
    "their present energy release of @xmath138 @xcite is roughly what is required in order to produce a sufficient flux of uhecr , assuming that the injection power law is flat ( @xmath139 ) @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath140 describes the ratio of the total power of the radio galaxy to the equipartition estimate based on its radio luminosity , and it enters the used radio luminosity - jet - power relation of @xcite .",
    "we expect @xmath141 within an order of magnitude . in the estimate of the radio galaxy power",
    "the observed radio luminosity function  @xcite was integrated only for sources with a 2.7 ghz luminosity of more than @xmath142 , since they correspond to a luminosity of @xmath143 .",
    "this would provide the required uhecr luminosity per source of @xmath144 , using the optimistic assumption of @xcite that @xmath145 of the radio galaxy power is converted into uhecrs .",
    "the implied number density of these radio galaxies is @xmath146 and , therefore , is only marginally consistent with the required @xmath147 . since the number density increases strongly with decreasing @xmath148 this requirement",
    "can possibly be fulfilled by allowing for a larger number of less powerful uhecr sources .",
    "this implies that basically every radio galaxy has to be an efficient uhecr source , not only the most powerful ones . since many of the weaker radio galaxies do not exhibit a hot spot , which is assumed to be the uhecr acceleration site in the scenario of @xcite , their efficiency in producing uhecr",
    "might be largely reduced .",
    "this is a potential serious problem for this scenario , since lowering @xmath149 by several orders of magnitude can not be fully compensated by assuming a higher radio galaxy jet - power , because @xmath150 does not seem to be consistent with observations of radio galaxies .    to conclude",
    ", radio galaxies can be the sources of uhecrs if even weak radio galaxies are efficient particle accelerators to the highest energies , otherwise they have serious problems to reproduce the smooth uhecr arrival direction distribution .",
    "we also found that consistency with the isotropy observed by agasa down to @xmath0ev requires the existence of an isotropic component with a flux about a factor 3 larger than the local component .",
    "this isotropic component would presumably be of cosmological origin and thus would not contribute significantly above @xmath1ev due to the gzk effect , consistent with the fact that at these energies we find local scenarios consistent with all data .",
    "the resulting best fit injection spectrum for the local component is @xmath151 .",
    "in contrast , for the charged primaries of the cosmological component to dominate around @xmath0ev steep injection spectra and/or weak magnetic fields around observer and sources would be required .",
    "these two conflicting requirements provide a strong argument against the hypothesis of local astrophysical sources of uhecrs above @xmath4ev in a strongly magnetized and structured intergalactic medium .",
    "finally , we have also demonstrated that already a modest increase in data together with full - sky coverage will allow to put considerably stronger constraints on uhecr source and magnetic field scenarios than presently possible . in particular ,",
    "our local scenarios predict the emergence of significant dipoles and quadrupoles above @xmath1ev .    modeling our cosmic neighborhood and simulating uhecr propagation in this environment will therefore become more and more important in the coming years .",
    "this will also have to include the effects of the galactic magnetic field and an extension to a possible heavy component of nuclei . for",
