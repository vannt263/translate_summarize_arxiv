    "the isotropic spectrum in @xmath60 symmetry is given by @xmath167 and @xmath168 is , as clearly can be seen in fig .",
    "[ d4hnimncu ] , non zero .",
    "the linear dichroism that branches from the cubic @xmath54 representation is shown in the middle panel .",
    "the second panel from the right shows the circular dichroic spectra .",
    "differences in the antisymmetric part of the scattering tensor are almost always neglected , but for reasonable distortions , present in e.g. layered perovskite structures large differences can be seen between the @xmath169 and @xmath170 spectra . going beyond @xmath171 symmetry thus also affects the antisymmetric part of @xmath4 .    the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ d4hnimncu ] shows the spectra of mn@xmath161 as a function of tetragonal distortion .",
    "mn@xmath161 has a @xmath172 configuration and depending on the distortion it will have an occupied @xmath173 orbital ( top ) or an occupied @xmath174 orbital . as in the case of ni@xmath133 , for the spherical to cubic distortion , one has an immediate effect for all fundamental spectra and in particular also in the antisymmetric part of the scattering tensor .",
    "this is important for magnetic circular dichroism and rxd in all kinds of manganates where orbital order and magnetic order co - exists .    the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ d4hnimncu ] shows the fundamental spectra of the scattering tensor for cu@xmath133 a @xmath175 configuration .",
    "this is a particularly simple and instructive example as all calculations can be done by hand and everything can be done in a one particle picture .",
    "the ground - state has one hole in the @xmath87 shell and the final state one hole in the @xmath137 shell .",
    "the ground - state hole in the @xmath87-shell will either be in the @xmath176 orbital ( bottom of fig .",
    "[ d4hnimncu ] ) or in the @xmath177 orbital ( top of fig .",
    "[ d4hnimncu ] ) . for the natural dichroism ( left panel ,",
    "@xmath178 and @xmath179 ) one finds that for an @xmath173 hole there is no intensity in the @xmath179 as one can not excite into the @xmath173 electron with @xmath13 polarized light . for an @xmath174 hole",
    "there is a ratio of 1 to 3 for the different fundamental spectra .",
    "note that the spectra are independent of the size of the distortion and only depend on the symmetry of the ground - state .",
    "the symmetric part of the magnetic scattering tensor is zero for a @xmath175 configuration , which is a general property of any kramers doublet .",
    "the spin - up and spin - down state are related by a mirror symmetry and therefore should have the same symmetric part of the scattering tensor .",
    "at the same time the sum of the scattering tensor for the spin - up and spin - down state should be equal to the paramagnetic tensor which is given by the @xmath162 components .",
    "therefore the symmetric magnetic part of the scattering tensor should be zero for a ground - state kramers doublet .",
    "the antisymmetric part shows a very strong crystal orientation dependence . for a @xmath173 hole in the ground - state ,",
    "the @xmath169 spectra is finite , but the @xmath170 spectrum is zero .",
    "this is again related to the fact that one can not excite into the @xmath173 hole with @xmath13 polarized light .",
    "for the cuprates , the rxd spectra are thus only sensitive to the out - of - plane moment .",
    "we have shown that the fundamental spectra of the scattering or conductivity tensor are strongly influenced by the crystal field symmetry at the transition metal @xmath0 edge .",
    "both the symmetric part as noted previously , @xcite but also the antisymmetric part show strong deviations from the spectra calculated in spherical symmetry . when the symmetry is lowered the fundamental spectra known from spherical symmetry branch into several different spectra . at the same time",
    "higher order spectra become non - zero and are important . in general more fundamental spectra are needed in order to describe the conductivity tensor as one might have expected .",
    "we have shown to what extent the crystal symmetry effects the magneto - optical effects and how they influence rxd and xas experiments .",
    "the reason for the deviations from the simple rule that the scattered intensity at an antiferromagnetic bragg reflection is proportional to @xmath1 is given by the fact that in spherical symmetry there is only one tensor element that describes the antisymmetric part of the conductivity tensor . in cubic symmetry",
    "this already becomes more complicated as @xmath46 can not be neglected if @xmath180 is larger then 1 .",
    "in tetragonal or lower symmetry also @xmath42 branches to different spectra .",
    "when the spin aligns in a high symmetry direction of the crystal there still will be only one tensor element describing the antisymmetric part of @xmath4 and therefore the simple scattering rules as derived in spherical symmetry will still hold . even when this tensor element is made from a linear combination of @xmath42 and @xmath46",
    "; as long as their ratio is the same for all polarizations the simple rules hold . in most cases",
    "the , single ion anisotropy will dictate the preferred direction of the magnetic moments , aligning it along high symmetry directions . in this case",
    "the simple rules are valid .",
    "local magnetic moments are not always aligned in a high - symmetry crystal direction .",
    "well known examples are the simple rock - salts like nio , mno and coo .",
    "an other class would be magnetic spiral structures as found in the cuprates and manganates . in these cases",
    "a more involved spectral line shape analysis is needed in order to determine the magnetization direction .",
    "one then can not measure the scattered intensity at a single photon energy , but needs to measure the energy dependence at all azimuthal directions in order to obtain more information . by comparing the line - shape to theory at different azimuthal directions or by the use of sum - rules one then can still obtain the full information as present in the data .",
    "the present calculations could be proved by magnetic circular and linear dichroism experiments .",
    "temperature dependence of the magneto - optical effects as well as non - full magnetization of the sample will be discussed in a future work .",

    "<S> a general symmetry analysis of the optical conductivity or scattering tensor is used to rewrite the conductivity tensor as a sum of fundamental spectra multiplied by simple functions depending on the local magnetization direction . using this formalism </S>",
    "<S> , we present several numerical examples at the transition metal @xmath0 edge . from these numerical calculations </S>",
    "<S> we can conclude that large deviations from the magneto - optical effects in spherical symmetry are found . </S>",
    "<S> these findings are in particular important for resonant x - ray diffraction experiments where the polarization dependence and azimuthal dependence of the scattered bragg intensity is used to determine the local ordered magnetization direction .    </S>",
    "<S> resonant x - ray diffraction or reflectivity ( rxd ) has developed into a powerful method to study charge , orbital and magnetic ordering in transition metal compounds and artificially created superlattices . in principle </S>",
    "<S> the resonant energy dependence of the scattering profile and its polarization and azimuthal dependence contain the information about the local magnetic , charge , and orbital order . </S>",
    "<S> obtaining this information from such spectra is often still a theoretical and experimental challenge .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the more straightforward methods to analyze magnetic bragg reflections has been presented by hannon _ </S>",
    "<S> _ et al.__@xcite and several other authors . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite they showed that the azimuthal intensity dependence can be related to the local orientation of the magnetic moment by a simple relation . </S>",
    "<S> the scattered intensity is proportional to @xmath1 , whereby @xmath2 is the polarization of the incoming ( outgoing ) light and @xmath3 is a unit vector in the direction of the magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> these relations are used relatively often in the analyses of rxd nowadays . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the crux is that these relations are derived in spherical symmetry and strictly speaking hold only in spherical symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> an extended formalism has been presented , @xcite but not seen a large audience so far . </S>",
    "<S> the question the present paper tries to answer is : how large are the changes of the scattered intensity when the effects of the real crystal symmetry is included and when is it important to include the real crystal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> in other words we answer the question when one can use the formulas derived in spherical symmetry and when the true crystal symmetry has to be included . </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on purely magnetic bragg reflections and neglect spin - orbit coupling for the initial or ground - state when doing the numerical calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> a hint for the importance of including the correct crystal symmetry might be obtained from absorption spectroscopy . by the optical theorem @xcite it </S>",
    "<S> is well known that the scattering tensor @xmath4 and the conductivity tensor @xmath5 are related by a factor of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore all magneto - optical effects known from absorption spectroscopy should return in diffraction or reflectivity experiments . </S>",
    "<S> recently it has been realized that the symmetric part of the conductivity tensor due to magnetism i.e. the magnetic linear dichroism effect is not given by a single spectrum as in spherical symmetry , but behaves more complicated in cubic or lower symmetries@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for an antiferromagnetic bragg reflection the symmetric part of the scattering tensor does not contribute to the diffracted intensity . </S>",
    "<S> how the antisymmetric part of the conductivity tensor behaves for less than spherical symmetry is not well known in the x - ray regime . </S>",
    "<S> for infra - red and visible wave - lengths there are several experiments and numerical calculations showing that for systems with less than cubic symmetry , the magnetic part of the optical conductivity tensor @xmath5 becomes considerably different from what is expected in spherical symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite one might thus expect that also for x - ray wavelengths the spectral line - shape of circular dichroism and magnetic bragg reflections should be crucially influenced by the crystal symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> in the present paper , we show several calculations at the transition metal @xmath0 edge in order to exemplify when deviations from spherical symmetry become important . </S>",
    "<S> to present the results in a consistent picture , we first introduce a symmetry analysis of the magnetization direction dependence of the conductivity tensor or scattering tensor . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to define a few fundamental spectra that describe the entire optical response of a system independent of the magnetization direction . </S>",
    "<S> we will assume a certain symmetry in the paramagnetic phase and in the ordered phase an additional , symmetry breaking sub - lattice magnetization in an arbitrary direction , given by @xmath8 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the tensor formalism used is in principle valid for any type of magneto - optical experiment and closely related , though not entirely equivalent , to previous publications . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the formalism can be used for the description of the crystal orientation dependence of the kerr angle in the infra - red regime on cro@xmath9 @xcite or the magnetic bragg diffraction of the cuprates at 930 - 950 ev .    </S>",
    "<S> the first section presents a general derivation of the scattering tensor or conductivity tensor as a function of magnetization direction for several different point - group symmetries . in the second section </S>",
    "<S> we will show how these tensors can be rewritten to simple dot products relating the scattered intensity to the polarization of the incoming and outgoing light in the same way as previously presented@xcite in spherical symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the third section is reserved for calculations of the fundamental spectra of several example materials in cubic point - group symmetry ( the symmetry relates to the paramagnetic phase ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fourth section presents results in tetragonal symmetry . within the conclusions we will discuss when deviation from spherical symmetry becomes visible in experiment and how the magnetization direction can be deduced from resonant x - ray diffraction experiments </S>"
