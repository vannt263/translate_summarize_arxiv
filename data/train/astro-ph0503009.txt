    "surveys for active galactic nuclei ( agns ) were until recently most commonly conducted in the observed optical band ( corresponding to the rest - frame uv for high - redshift agns ) ; consequently , our understanding of the agn population is biased toward properties inferred from agn samples bright in the optical .",
    "radio , infrared , and x - ray surveys have revealed more reddened and obscured agns , attesting to the presence of an optical bias .",
    "agn surveys in non - optical bands still require optical or uv spectroscopy to confirm the presence of an active nucleus ( except for bright , hard x - ray selected agns , or agns with large radio jets ) and to determine the redshift .",
    "historically , our understanding of the evolution of the luminous agn population with cosmic time has been based largely on optically selected agn samples ; use of samples selected in other bands to further this understanding requires proper interpretation of the relations between emission in these bands and optical / uv emission for comparison .",
    "x - ray surveys are more penetrating and efficient in separating the host - galaxy contribution from the nuclear emission for sources with @xmath3ergs@xmath4 , as the integrated host - galaxy x - ray emission is negligible compared to the nuclear emission ( which contributes of the agn bolometric luminosity ) . in order to compare x - ray survey results on agn evolution to those in the optical / uv , as well as to understand better the details of the nuclear environment and the accretion process powering agns",

    "@xcite discovered that a large fraction of uv - excess and radio - selected agns are strong x - ray sources with x - ray luminosities correlated with those measured in the rest - frame uv .",
    "this result was confirmed by @xcite , who also found that the x - ray emission of agns depends on their radio power ( with radio - loud agns being on average @xmath5 times brighter in x - rays ) and that the optical / uv - to - x - ray monochromatic flux ratios of agns depend on rest - frame uv luminosity and/or redshift .",
    "the relation between agn emission in the rest - frame uv and x - ray bands is commonly cast into a ratio of monochromatic fluxes called `` optical / uv - to - x - ray index '' , @xmath2 , defined as the slope of a hypothetical power law extending between 2500  and 2kev in the agn rest frame comes from the name `` optical - to - x - ray index '' .",
    "`` optical '' is somewhat of a misnomer since it refers to the ultraviolet ( 2500  rest - frame ) monochromatic flux which falls in the observed optical band for most bright agns studied originally .",

    "furthermore , refined knowledge of the `` normal '' range of rest - frame uv - to - x - ray luminosity ratios in agns is necessary to define more accurately special agn subclasses ( e.g. , x - ray weak agns ) and ( under certain assumptions ) estimate the x - ray emission associated with jets in rl agns .    establishing the relations between the intrinsic rest - frame uv and x - ray emission in optically selected samples ( excluding the effects of absorption and jet - associated x - ray emission )",

    "we have constructed a sample of 155 sdss agns in medium - deep _ rosat _ fields , supplemented with a low - redshift seyfert  1 sample and a high - redshift luminous agn sample ( for a total of 228 agns ) , to investigate the relation between rest - frame uv and soft x - ray emission in rq agns .",
    "several important conditions must be met to ensure the appropriateness of the sample and statistical methods :    \\1 . large ranges of luminosity and redshift must be sampled to reveal weak correlations of @xmath2 with luminosity and redshift .",
    "additionally , a significant range in luminosity at each redshift is necessary to control for the strong redshift dependence of luminosity in flux - limited samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the main sdss sample provides adequate luminosity coverage in the redshift range ; the addition of the seyfert  1 and agn samples ( see @xmath7[sample ] ) increases the range of luminosities probed at low and high redshifts , respectively .",
    "it is necessary to determine the radio loudness of each agn and to exclude the strongly radio - loud ( rl ) agns .",
    "rl agns have more complex mechanisms of energy generation , such as jet emission , which can obscure the x - ray emission directly associated with accretion ( particularly if an agn is observed at a small viewing angle )",

    "some previous studies lacked adequate radio coverage and/or did not separate these two agn populations .",
    "\\3 . because we wish to quantify any evolution of the main intrinsic energy generation mechanism in agns , it is necessary to exclude agns strongly affected by absorption .",
    "strong x - ray absorption in agns is often associated with the presence of broad ultraviolet absorption lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the large observed wavelength range and high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of the sdss spectroscopy is sufficient to find broad absorption line ( bal ) agns in 4070% of the sample ( see below ) , allowing us to limit the confusing effects of x - ray absorption",
    "special statistical tools are needed to evaluate correlations when censored data points are present .",
    "we use the rank correlation coefficients method described by @xcite to determine the significance of correlations in the presence of censored data points , while taking into account third - variable dependencies .",

    "our current sample has 86% x - ray detections ( compared to for previous studies ) .",
    "one of the assumptions of the statistical methods described in ( 4 ) , which could be violated , is that the agns with upper limits and detections have the same underlying distributions of @xmath2 and rest - frame uv luminosity .",
    "the effect of this assumption is partially alleviated by excluding rl and bal agns , but achieving a high detection fraction is the only definitive way to suppress the effect of the unknown and likely different distributions of @xmath2 and rest - frame uv luminosity for agns with x - ray detections and limits .",
    "the results from statistical analyses must take into account the findings of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite that apparent correlations can be caused by a large dispersion of the measured monochromatic luminosity in the optical / uv relative to the x - ray band . in this work we use monte carlo simulations of our sample ( as described in",
    "* ) to confirm the robustness of the present correlations .",
    "\\7 . unlike previous studies , we measure directly the rest - frame uv monochromatic flux at 2500  in three - quarters of the agns comprising the sdss sample , which guarantees measurement errors of @xmath1310% .",
    "this is made possible by the improved spectrophotometry of sdss data release two ( dr2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "special care is needed to account for the effects of host - galaxy contamination of the rest - frame uv monochromatic flux measurements for low - luminosity agns .",
    "the high - quality and large wavelength range of the sdss spectra are well suited for this .",
    "if several x - ray instruments or reductions are used to measure x - ray monochromatic fluxes , it is necessary to assess mission - to - mission cross - calibration uncertainties and the effects of different reduction techniques .",

    "the largest optically selected agn sample with a high fraction of x - ray detections ( @xmath16 ) used for establishing the relations between optical / uv and x - ray emission to date is the vbs03 sample of sdss agns in regions of pointed _ rosat _ pspc observations .",
    "the vbs03 sample consists of 140 rq agns from the sdss early data release ( edr ; * ? ? ? * ) with a soft x - ray detection fraction of 50% , supplemented by higher redshift optically selected agns .",
    "the second data release of the sdss provides a large agn sample ( 9 times that of the edr ) with accurate spectrophotometry , which together with the large medium - deep _ rosat _ sky coverage , allows us to improve the vbs03 study significantly by increasing the detection fraction to @xmath1780% for a similar size sample , while taking into account the effects of host - galaxy contributions in the optical / uv for lower luminosity , nearby agns . in this paper",

    "* ) , but this method provides only mean values , without constraining the spread in each bin . in addition , stacking analyses done to date have not always allowed for binning in galactic hydrogen column densities , redshifts , radio - loudness , and strong uv - absorption .",
    "the @xmath149@xmath0 relation presented here can be used to predict more accurately the intrinsic x - ray fluxes of agns with known optical / uv luminosity and serves to define the `` normal '' range of soft x - ray emission for a typical agn ( i.e. , rq , non - bal agns , unaffected by absorption ) .",
    "based on this definition of normal x - ray emission , it is easier to determine if a `` special '' class of agns differs in its x - ray properties from normal agns .",
    "x - ray `` weak '' agns are an example of such a special agn class .",

    "larger samples will include more homogeneous low - luminosity agn data , providing more sensitive constraints on the non - linearity of the relation .",

    "is the first step toward understanding their generation mechanisms and interrelations .",
    "a reasonable next step is to try to relate the correlations found here to reasonable estimates of black - hole masses and accretion rates .",
    "the difficulty in this endeavor lies in the fact that direct black - hole mass measurements and bolometric luminosity estimates are not available for large agn samples like those considered here .",
    "indirect black - hole mass measurements can be obtained from a combination of monochromatic luminosity and broad emission - line width measurements as shown for bqs sample agns by @xcite and sdss agns by @xcite .",
    "such estimates , however , will depend on the extrapolation of @xcite relation from lower ( @xmath207 , corresponding to @xmath208 ) to higher ( @xmath209 ) luminosity agns , the use of different emission lines at different redshifts ( e.g. , h@xmath210 and for the sdss sample presented here ) , as well as a non - trivial correction for the effects of the host - galaxy , giving rise to possible systematic errors .",

    "<S> using a sample of 228 optically selected active galactic nuclei ( agns ) in the redshift range with a high fraction of x - ray detections ( 8186% ) , we study the relation between rest - frame uv and soft x - ray emission and its evolution with cosmic time . </S>",
    "<S> the majority of the agns in our sample ( 155 objects ) have been selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) in an unbiased way , rendering the sample results representative of all sdss agns . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of two heterogeneous samples of 36 high - redshift and 37 low - redshift agns further supports and extends our conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that the x - ray emission from agns is correlated with their uv emission , and that the ratio of the monochromatic luminosity emitted at 2kev compared to 2500  decreases with increasing luminosity ( , where @xmath0 is in @xmath1 units ) , but does not change with cosmic time . </S>",
    "<S> these results apply to intrinsic agn emission , as we correct or control for the effects of the host galaxy , uv / x - ray absorption , and any x - ray emission associated with radio emission in agns . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate a variety of systematic errors and can thereby state with confidence that ( 1 ) the @xmath2@xmath0 anti - correlation is real and not a result of accumulated systematic errors and ( 2 ) any @xmath2 dependence on redshift is negligible in comparison . </S>",
    "<S> we provide the best quantification of the @xmath2@xmath0 relation to date for normal radio - quiet agns ; this should be of utility for researchers pursuing a variety of studies . </S>"
