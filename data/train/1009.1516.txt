    "a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of the origin of is that all periodic orbits in a neighbourhood of @xmath11 in the @xmath9-plane have the same period so the center is ( locally ) isochronous . in this case",
    "all orbits of ( 1.1 ) in @xmath0 , with @xmath35 near @xmath11 , are periodic and have the same period .",
    "moreover , a further first integral appears as we shall see using a result of barone and cesar  @xcite .",

    "our result relates these functions with the even functions and so it shows that isochronicity in the @xmath9-plane , and lyapunov stability for , is a rare phenomenon among the class .",
    "isochronous centers were first studied by urabe  @xcite with a different approach , in  @xcite a new characterization by means of the so called ` involutions ' @xmath37 was found which permits to construct the functions giving isochronous centers .    generally we have instability of the equilibrium for and it is very easy to show explicit functions for it , for instance @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "this kind of instability is quite weak since the linearization of the system at the origin in @xmath0 has the double eigenvalues @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , there are no asymptotic motions to the equilibrium , namely no motions with the origin as limit point as @xmath41 . in the present paper , instability without asymptotic motions",
    "is called _",
    "weak instability_.    in our hamiltonian systems , instability occurs because there is a sequence of initial data which converges to the origin whose corresponding solutions are unbounded and the motion is slow , indeed shows that the coordinate @xmath26 is an affine function of time .",

    "we check at once that the function @xmath58 is a @xmath3 diffeomorphism onto the image @xmath59 which is a symmetric interval @xmath60 moreover , since @xmath61 we have that @xmath37 is also a diffeomorphism : @xmath62 we call @xmath37 the _ involution _ associated with @xmath48 . remark that the graph of @xmath37 is symmetric with respect to the diagonal which intersects at the origin ; indeed @xmath63 has @xmath64 as symmetric point and this coincides with the point @xmath65 of the graph .",

    "since the linear combination of @xmath24 and @xmath168 gives the general solution , we have just proved the following    [ pex3.2 ] let us fix @xmath74 with @xmath75 , then the solutions to the @xmath32-periodic equation are either all @xmath32-periodic , or all unbounded but those proportional to @xmath169 .",

    "let us remark that we can easily construct unstable cases with some @xmath164 at which   holds and so the corresponding orbits are all periodic .",
