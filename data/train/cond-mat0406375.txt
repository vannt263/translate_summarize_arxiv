    "density functional theory@xcite ( dft ) is nowadays the most widely used method for electronic structure calculations , in both condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry , thanks to the combination of low computational cost and remarkable accuracy for a wide variety of chemical bonds and solid - state systems .",
    "there are , however , notable exceptions to such an accuracy . for example , even the best available approximations of the exchange - correlation functional , the key ingredient of the dft , fail to recover long - range van der waals interactions,@xcite are not completely safe for the description of the hydrogen bond @xcite and have intrinsic problems with situations of near degeneracy ( when two sets of orbitals happen to have very close energies ) .",
    "@xcite more generally , the `` chemical accuracy '' ( the accuracy needed to predict the rates of chemical reactions ) has not yet been reached .",
    "for all these reasons the search for new approximate functionals , or even new ways of exploiting the basic ideas and advantages of the dft , is very active.@xcite    in this context several authors@xcite have suggested to split the electron - electron interaction into a short - range part , to be treated within the dft , and a long - range part , to be handled by other techniques .",
    "the motivation behind these  mixed schemes \" is that the dft , even in the simplest local - density approximation ( lda ) , provides an accurate description of the short - range electron - electron repulsion,@xcite while other techniques which give a poor description of short - range properties , like the configuration interaction ( ci ) method or the random - phase approximation ( rpa),@xcite can , instead , accurately capture long - range correlation effects .    of course there is no unique way to split the coulomb potential @xmath2 into a short - range ( sr ) and a long - range ( lr ) part .",
    "the error function and its complement @xmath3 have been already used for this purpose @xcite ( see fig .  [ fig_erf ] ) , and we stick to this choice , which yields analytic matrix elements for both gaussians and plane waves , i.e. , the most common basis functions in quantum chemistry and solid - state physics , respectively .",

    "<S> motivated by recent suggestions to split the electron - electron interaction into a short - range part , to be treated within the density functional theory , and a long - range part , to be handled by other techniques we compute , with a diffusion monte carlo method , the ground - state energy of a uniform electron gas with a modified , short - range - only electron - electron interaction @xmath0 , for different values of the cutoff parameter @xmath1 and of the electron density . after deriving some exact limits , we propose an analytic representation of the correlation energy which accurately fits our monte carlo data and also includes , by construction , these exact limits , thus providing a reliable `` short - range local - density functional '' . </S>"
