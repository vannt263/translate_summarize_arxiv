    "it is with great pleasure that i dedicate this contribution to professor piyare lal jain , a pioneering faculty member in experimental high energy and heavy ion physics at the university at buffalo over the past fifty years , and a respected senior colleague of mine in the department of physics over the past twenty - five years .",
    "his mentoring , friendship and collaboration@xcite have been invaluable to me .",
    "my earliest work in the field of perturbative qcd with celmaster@xcite was on the renormalization prescription of the effective coupling @xmath0 and its experimental consequences .",
    "quantumchromodynamics ( qcd ) is an asymptotically - free quantum field theory .",
    "the scaling behavior of green s functions in the deep euclidean region can be computed as a perturbation series in the renormalized coupling constant @xmath0 , which depends on the characteristic energy scale involved in the process .",
    "this property of qcd was first used to obtain predictions for scale breaking of the naive parton model in deeply - inelastic lepton - hadron scattering .",
    "the domain of applicability of perturbative qcd has since been extended to include @xmath1 annihilation to hadrons and numerous other infrared safe observables at high energy colliders@xcite .    a typical prediction of perturbative qcd is an @xmath2-th moment of a structure function in deeply - inelastic scattering@xcite @xmath3a_n\\ ; , \\label{mng - eq}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the su(3)@xmath5 coupling parameter , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are calculable numbers , and the normalization @xmath8 can not be calculated in perturbation theory .",
    "the coefficient @xmath7 depends on how ultraviolet divergences are renormalized , and so implicitly does the coupling @xmath9 .",
    "the renormalization - prescription dependence of @xmath7 must be related to that of @xmath9 because physical observables can not depend on how the theory is renormalized . to exhibit this dependence , express @xmath9 in terms of the coupling @xmath10 in a different renormalization scheme : @xmath11\\ ; , \\label{ggprime - eq}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is a calculable constant . to obtain the coefficient @xmath13 in the second scheme , substitute the expression for @xmath9 in eq .",

    "( [ mng - eq ] ) : @xmath14a_n = ( g')^{a_n}[1+b'_ng'^2+{\\cal o}(g'^4)]a_n \\;. \\label{mngprime - eq}\\ ] ]    if the perturbation series in eqs .",
    "( [ mng - eq],[mngprime - eq ] ) were known to all orders in the couplings @xmath15 , then the renormalization - prescription dependence would have no observable consequences . in practice ,",
    "the series can not be computed beyond the first two or three orders of perturbation theory for most observables .",
    "the truncated series do depend on renormalization prescription , and differ by terms of the leading uncomputed order in the series . since @xmath16 at currently - accessible energy scales ,",
    "the discrepancies are experimentally significant .",
    "this type of dependence on the re - definition of a small expansion parameter will arise in any truncated series expansion .",
    "in particular , perturbative series in the fine structure constant @xmath17 of quantumelectrodynamics ( qed ) , are also subject to truncation ambiguities .",
    "the issue is less severe in qed however for two reasons : first , the expansion parameter @xmath18 is much smaller than @xmath0 , and so are truncation ambiguities . secondly , there is a naturally preferred definition of @xmath17 which is experimentally measurable in principle .",
    "in fact , the cross section for compton scattering of a photon from a spin one - half charged particle can be shown to reduce to the classical thompson cross section to all orders in perturbation theory in the limit of zero photon energy .",
    "there is no such natural definition in qcd , either in the low - energy limit where the theory becomes strongly interacting , or in the high - energy limit where the effective coupling tends to zero due to asymptotic freedom .",
    "several approaches have been proposed to deal with the prescription dependence of predictions in perturbative qcd :    * * good universal prescriptions : * the strategy is to find and use a prescription that appears to give a reasonably convergent perturbation series in a wide variety of processes .",
    "the archetypical example of this approach is the widely - used @xmath19 scheme recommended by bardeen , buras , duke and muta@xcite in which dimensionally - regularized quantities are renormalized by subtracting poles and certain associated constants in the combination @xmath20 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is a continuation of 4 space - time dimensions and @xmath22 is euler s constant .",
    "this is a modification of the minimal subtraction ( ms ) scheme of thooft and veltman@xcite in which only the pole in @xmath23 is subtracted .",
    "another proposal by brodsky , lepage and mackenzie@xcite uses light - quark vacuum polarization insertions to determine the scale of @xmath0 in any process that does not involve gluon - gluon couplings in leading order . * * fastest apparent convergence : * it is by no means guaranteed that a good universal prescription must exist . a different strategy suggested by grunberg@xcite tailors the prescription to each individual process in order to make the higher order terms in the series as small as possible .",
    "for example , in eq .",
    "( [ mngprime - eq ] ) , one might choose @xmath24 , so that the qcd prediction is given by the leading order term .",
    "the different coupling parameters , determined experimentally for example from the different moments @xmath25 , are related to one another by eqs .",
    "( [ ggprime - eq],[mngprime - eq ] ) . * * the principle of minimum sensitivity : * stevenson@xcite suggested choosing a renormalization prescription optimally for each process considered by requiring that the truncated perturbative expression be an extremum with respect to variations in the parameters of the renormaliztion group of gell - mann and low@xcite , and stueckelberg and petermann@xcite . at next - to - leading order in qcd , predictions depend on one renormalization group parameter , the scale @xmath26 of the effective coupling @xmath27 .",
    "each of these strategies has its advantages and shortcomings .",
    "there is no rigorous justification for any of them within the framework of quantum field theory .",
    "each of them is a more or less educated guess concerning the size of uncomputed terms in the perturbation series .",
    "the only way to verify this guess is to compute these unknown terms !",
    "celmaster and gonsalves@xcite proposed an alternative to the ms and @xmath19 prescriptions called momentum - space subtraction ( mom ) . in this approach",
    ", one considers the basic off - shell green s functions that must be renormalized in any perturbative calculation beyond tree level . at one - loop level , these are the three - gluon , the quark - gluon , and ( in covariant gauges ) the ghost - gluon scattering amplitudes .",
    "the theory is renormalized by subtracting these fundamental building - block amplitudes at an energy scale that is typical of the process under consideration , which also serves as the scale of the effective coupling @xmath0 .",
    "the motivation for the mom prescription is the intuition that ultraviolet behavior is dominated by the off - shell green s functions that need to be renormalized .",
    "if these green s functions are primarily responsible for the divergent behavior of the unrenormalized theory , then subtracting their contributions at the typical energy scale of the process will minimize their effect on the perturbative correction terms . because subtractions are performed on a small number of generic green s functions , momentum - space subtraction is an example of a good universal prescription .",
    "the mom prescription proposal suffers from some ambiguities .",
    "there are three different vertices at one - loop level that can be chosen to define the subtraction .",
    "each of these off - shell vertices is gauge dependent , and so a particular gauge must be chosen to define the subtraction . and finally , each three - point vertex is has two independently - variable momenta flowing through it , and these must be fixed in relation to the energy scale .",
    "a detailed study of these vertices showed that it is possible to define a class of mom prescriptions that gives reasonably - sized next - to - leading order qcd corrections in a number of processes .",
    "the corrections are only weakly gauge - dependent if a covariant gauge is used with the gauge parameter allowed to vary quite freely in the range of the usual feynman and landau gauges .",
    "we choose a natural and intuitively reasonable choice of momenta at which to subtract a three - point function , namely the symmetric euclidean point @xmath28 .",
    "the off - shell green s functions are related by ward - takahashi identities , which relate the different prescription in the mom class to one another . for symmetric - point subtraction ,",
    "the class of mom prescriptions is also only weakly dependent on the chosen vertex .",
    "celmaster and gonsalves@xcite showed that @xmath29 s defined in different schemes can be related exactly by performing a one - loop calculation .",
    "it is well known that the renormalization group equation @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the qcd beta function with leading coefficient @xmath32 , can be integrated to express the scale dependence of the qcd coupling @xmath33 in terms of a renormalization - group invariant qcd parameter @xmath29 , which does however depend on the renormalization prescription used to define @xmath34 .",
    "this relation can be solved perturbatively for the ratio @xmath35 \\;,\\ ] ] where the coupling parameters are related by eq .",

    "on of the most powerful probes of the short - distance structure of hadrons is the virtual photon produced by annihilation of an energetic pair in colliding beams of electrons and positrons .",
    "this process provides a plethora of measurable inclusive cross sections and distributions that have been used to discover new quark species , and to study bound states of heavy quarks , the densities of partons in hadrons , and the fundamental structure of the quark - gluon interaction .",
    "the simplest observable is the total cross section for annihilation to hadrons , which can be expressed in the form @xmath42 \\ ; , \\label{sigmatoteq}\\ ] ] where the sum is over quark flavors @xmath43 , with @xmath44 being the fractional quark charge , and the next - to - leading order coefficient @xmath45 is calculable in perturbative qcd .",

    "the cross section is proportional to the number of quark colors and thus provides a direct measurement of the @xmath47 in su(3 ) .",
    "the fractional electric charge of each new quark species is directly measured by the increase of the flavor sum as the threshold is crossed , and is most dramatically illustrated by the data in fig .",

    "this result agreed precisely with an earlier numerical calculation by dine and sapirstein@xcite on gauge - invariant subsets of diagrams and their sum .",
    "the analytic result was also obtained in an independent calculation by chetyrkin , kataev and tkachov@xcite .",

    "if qcd with massless quarks were a finite theory , then the dimensionless function @xmath60 would be a pure number independent of @xmath61 .",
    "because of ultraviolet and infrared divergences , the theory must be regularized to compute @xmath60 as a perturbative series in the qcd coupling @xmath0 .",
    "this is most conveniently done by analytically continuing @xmath60 to the region of spacelike @xmath62 and to space - time dimension @xmath63 .",
    "the unrenormalized function @xmath64 is then real and finite , with divergences manifest as poles in @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the unrenormalized ( bare or zero order ) qed and qcd coupling parameters respectively , and the coefficient @xmath69 is got by computing @xmath2-loop feynman diagram contributions to the photon propagator . the dependence of the unrenormalized propagator on the sole dimensional quantity @xmath61 in massless qcd follows from dimensional analysis .",
    "the propagator is made finite in the limit @xmath70 by subtracting divergences at a renormalization scale @xmath26 .",

( [ g - orthog ] ) and various other properties of the gegenbauer polynomials .",
    "the calculation of chetrykin , kataev and tkachov@xcite used a similar polynomial expansion technique in position space@xcite .",
    "a different method for computing the total annihilation cross section discussed in the preceding section would be to calculate the amplitudes for a virtual photon to decay to to 2 , 3 , or 4 partons , and then sum the individual cross sections integrated over the phase space of final state partons .",
    "( [ qff - diagrams ] ) shows the feynman diagrams which contribute to the 2-parton final states through order @xmath82 , i.e. , to the quark electromagnetic form factor .",
    "the form factor is ultra - violet finite ( when all qcd counterterms are included ) because the electromagnetic current is conserved , but it is infrared divergent due to soft and collinear singularities .",
    "these singularities are canceled by contributions from 3- and 4-parton final states so the total cross section is finite .",
    "the form factor is therefore an unphysical part of a measurable physical observable .",
    "however , it is an object of great theoretical interest because the soft and collinear singularities are generic in that they determine double - logarithmic sudakov effects in many measurable cross section  see the review article by collins@xcite .",
    "it was therefore of interest to study these singularities .",
    "a calculation@xcite of all two - loop integrals required for an analytical calculation of the form factor was completed in 1983 , including all terms of @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "the most challenging sets of integrals to compute were those which contribute to the box - plus - triangle diagram iii and the non - planar diagram iv in fig .",
    "( [ qff - diagrams ] ) .",
    "the calculations were done by converting the two - loop momentum integrals to 5-dimensional integrals over feynman parameters .",
    "the feynman parameter integration were performed analytically in succession using various techniques including infinite - series expansion of binomial expressions where necessary .",
    "care had to be taken to ensure that the binomial expansions converged after each successive integration : where necessary , the integration interval was subdivided and appropriately converging expansions used in each region .",

    "gehrmann , huber and maitre@xcite have recently obtained elegant exact expressions for the integrals in diagram iv in @xmath21 dimensions .",
    "these two - loop results have been used in several @xmath85 qcd calculations including the drell - yan total cross section by hamberg , van neerven and matsuura@xcite , the total cross section for higgs production by harlander and kilgore@xcite and anastasiou and melnikov@xcite , the drell - yan rapidity distribution by anastasiou , dixon , melnikov and petriello@xcite , and the higgs total cross section and drell - yan and higgs rapidity distributions by ravindran , smith and van neerven@xcite .    in a closely related calculation@xcite ,",
    "a tensor decomposition scheme that is exact in @xmath21 dimensions was used to compute the one - loop qcd corrections to the @xmath1 total annihilation cross section . unlike the process @xmath86 in which there is a single scalar form factor , the process @xmath87 involves 6 independent invariant tensors and corresponding form factors in @xmath88 dimensions . when the amplitude is continued to @xmath21 dimensions",
    ", there is a set of 17 linearly - independent tensors and corresponding form factors into which it can conveniently be decomposed .",
    "the decomposition makes it possible to compute the dimensionally - regularized amplitude very efficiently in @xmath89 , and the technique readily extends to two or more loops .    over the past few years , a number of results on form factors have appeared in the literature , including analytic results for arbitrary masses and momenta in qed@xcite and in qcd@xcite , and impressive new results on massless quark and gluon form factors at three loops@xcite .",

    "( [ cewi - int ] ) .",
    "these interference cross sections are largest when the exchanged @xmath93 or @xmath94 is on - shell when they are also odd under parity .",

    "parity - violating asymmetries were defined and presented at the parton level and for the hadronic processes @xmath98 or @xmath99 + 2 jets or @xmath96 + 2 jets , see fig .",
    "( [ cewi - had ] ) .",
    "these asymmetries are independent of the polarizations of all particles involved , and do not require that the flavors of the jet partons be measured . they are generally of order 0.01 pb at energies @xmath100 tev .",
    "a simple way of defining experimental observables that are sensitive to this parity - odd character of the interference terms is as follows : imagine that the incident beams lie in the plane of a mirror , as in fig .",
    "( [ cewi - mirror ] ) .",
    "if the incident beams are not polarized , the initial state is invariant under reflection in this mirror .",
    "we will also assume that the spins of the final state particles are not detected , i.e. , particles are identified by their momenta and internal quantum numbers only . a parity - odd contribution to the cross section",
    "can make the probabilities for observing a particular event ( i.e. , a particular configuration of final state particles ) and its mirror image different from one another . since the events are continuously distributed in phase space , the likelihood of finding an event and its geometrical mirror image in any finite sample of events is vanishingly small . to decide experimentally whether or not there is an asymmetry with respect to mirror reflection in the event sample",
    ", one must count the number of events that fall in some region of phase space ( which we will call a `` bin '' ) and the number of events that fall in the mirror image of this region ( which we will the `` image bin '' ) and then decide whether or not there is a statistically significant difference between these two numbers .",
    "this difference can be compared with a `` parity - violating asymmetry '' which we define as follows : @xmath101 the integral over the bin includes an implicit sum over all final state quantum numbers that are not observed , i.e. , color quantum numbers and any spin or flavor quantum numbers that can not be experimentally measured .",
    "a set of bins will have to be judiciously chosen to maximize the observed effects of parity violation , i.e. , to yield the largest cumulative asymmetry .",
    "thus we also define a cumulative parity - violating asymmetry as follows : @xmath102 where the sum is taken over bins that do not overlap with one another . a theoretical upper bound on @xmath103",
    "is given by @xmath104    these asymmetries might be observable in @xmath98 and @xmath105 collisions above the threshold for production of pairs of electroweak bosons , i.e. , at center of mass energies in the tev range and these asymmetries are comparable in magnitude to the pair - production cross sections .",

    ", the interference contribution is parity - violating , and this might make it easier to observe above a rather formidable qcd background of electroweak boson + 2 jet events .",
    "actual observation of these effects will require somewhat higher integrated luminosities than are currently available for example at the tevatron at fermilab .",
    "it remains to be seen whether these subtle standard model predictions will be observable at a high - energy multi - tev hadron collider such as the lhc .",

    "the production of real top quarks can safely be treated in a threshold approximation with the mass taken to be infinite below threshold and zero above .",
    "top quarks in loops pose a delicate problem because the standard model is renormalizable only if the left - handed quarks occur in su(2)@xmath144 doublets .",
    "this requirement is imposed by the well - known triangle anomaly ( which was discovered in qed by adler@xcite and bell and jackiw@xcite ) in the effective coupling of the axial - vector current to two gluons : if the top quark is omitted from the loop the amplitude is divergent in a non - renormalizable way ; if the top quark is included and assumed massless the top and bottom contributions cancel ; and if the top quark is included with a finite mass the contribution grows as the logarithm of the ratio of top to bottom masses .    the contributions in second order qcd of the diagrams in the left panel of fig .",
    "( [ triang92-fig ] ) involving a heavy - quark triangle with vector , vector and axial - vector vertices were studied by gonsalves , hung and pawowski@xcite .",
    "the contributions from the process @xmath145 ( ( a ) in fig .",
    "( [ triang92-fig ] ) ) had been analyzed earlier by dicus and willenbrock@xcite , who concluded that the contributions were numerically small at tevatron energies .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "( [ triang92-fig ] ) shows the numerical magnitudes of the various subprocess contributions at tevatron energies .",
    "rijken and van neerven@xcite subsequently computed all heavy quark contributions to the @xmath106 and @xmath122 total cross sections , neglecting only diagrams with heavy quarks in the initial state .",
    "they found that the contributions from the top quark were negligible at tevatron energies , but would contribute significantly at lhc energies with magnitude comparable to the @xmath146 qcd corrections .",
    "it is important to evaluate the top - quark - mass contributions to other measurable cross sections at lhc energies , in particular the @xmath106 and @xmath122 transverse momentum distributions .",
    "( [ triang08-fig ] ) shows the @xmath122 transverse - momentum distribution at tevatron and lhc energies including quark - triangle diagrams shown in fig .",
    "( [ triang92-fig ] ) .",
    "quark masses are taken into account using a simple threshold prescription@xcite by inserting a step function @xmath147 into sums over quark flavors @xmath129 in the subprocess cross sections .",
    "there is a significant change in the shape of the distribution at lhc energies due specifically to the virtual triangle - anomaly diagrams .    because the triangle - anomaly contributions are comparable in magnitude to the @xmath146 qcd radiative corrections , it is essential to include the top and bottom quark masses in the virtual triangle diagrams .",
    "a more precise calculation of the triangle - anomaly contributions to the @xmath122 transverse momentum distribution at lhc energies will be published elsewhere .",
