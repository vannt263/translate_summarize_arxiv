    "back to 1950 , the paper by matthews and salam @xcite and the subsequent works by salam in 1952 @xcite clarified the quantum field - theoretical approach to the electrodynamics of ( massive ) charged scalar particles . ever since , the problem of extending this investigation to include the case of ( massive ) charged vector particles became mandatory in view of the theoretical evidence for the role of charged and neutral spin-1 particles that should couple to the charged and neutral currents .    from 1960 ,",
    "komar and salam @xcite , salam @xcite , lee and yang @xcite and delbourgo and salam @xcite , gave a highly remarkable push for the understanding and construction of a fundamental theory for the microscopic interaction between charged vector bosons and photons .",
    "further works by tzou @xcite , aronson @xcite and velo and zwanziger @xcite summed up efforts to the previous papers and the final conclusion was that a consistent unitary and renormalizable quantum field - theoretical model would be possible only in a non - abelian scenario with a higgs sector that spontaneously breaks the gauge symmetry to give mass to the vector bosons , without spoiling the unitarity bounds for the cross section of the scattering of longitudinally polarized charged vector bosons @xcite .    here",
    ", we adopt this framework : the electrodynamics of ( massive ) charged vector bosons with a non - minimal dipole - type term coupling to the gauge field . in the case of the massless photon , this ensures a @xmath0value for the g - ratio of spin-1 particles . we should however point out that this dipole - type interaction is non - minimal from the viewpoint of an abelian symmetry ; if we take into account the local @xmath1 symmetry that backs the plus- and minus - charged vector bosons , the dipole coupling in the action is actually a minimal ( non - abelian , @xmath1 ) interaction term after spontaneous symmetry breaking has taken place .    in the present paper ,",
    "our main effort consists in pursuing a detailed investigation of the semi - classical aspects of the charge and spin interactions for massive charged matter of a vector nature .",
    "our central purpose is to compare the features and specific profiles of the influence of the spin of the charge carriers on interaction potentials ( electromagnetic or a more general @xmath2 interaction ) between two different categories of sources / currents : fermionic and spin-1 bosonic .",
    "we shall present the conclusions of our comparative procedure at the end of our calculations .    at this point",
    ", we highlight that the literature in the topic contemplates a great deal of articles discussing the structure of the electromagnetic current and electrodynamical aspects of spin-1 charged matter @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we pursue an investigation of an issue not considered in connection with spin-1 charged matter : the spin- and velocity - dependence of the interaction potential associated with ( pseudo-)scalar sources and pseudo - vector currents that interact by exchanging scalar and vector mediators , respectively . for the spin-1",
    ", these specific cases have not been addressed to in the literature .",
    "these extra sources / currents may not necessarily be associated to the electromagnetic interaction in that they do not follow from the @xmath2 symmetry of the electromagnetism .",
    "we may be describing a new force between these extra sources / current whose origin could be traced back to some more fundamental physics .",
    "the case of the usual vector current is reassessed here and our results match with the ones in the literature .",
    "it is worthy mentioning that fermionic sources / currents can display a wide range of spin- and velocity - dependent interparticle potentials @xcite@xcite@xcite , and several of them have been reconsidered in this article .",
    "the electrodynamics of ordinary fermionic matter is very well understood , from the macroscopic to the quantum level .",
    "scalar and vector bosonic charged matter , on the other hand , experience a richer variety of interactions when coupled to the electromagnetic field .",
    "so far , most of the theoretical and experimental literature dealing with macroscopic interactions consider only spin-1/2 matter , i.e. , fermionic sources / currents @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this preference is naturally due to the fact that ordinary charges in matter are carried by electrons .",
    "elementary spin-1 charged particles are difficult to observe , since the only known examples are the @xmath3 gauge bosons , whose mass is too large - and lifetime too short - to allow direct inspection ( its full width is @xmath4 @xcite ) .",
    "though not stable enough to be directly handled , elementary spin-1 particles have , in principle , their own electrodynamics and it is of theoretical interest to study how it deviates , or not , from its fermionic counterpart .",
    "on the other hand , at the atomic and nuclear level , it would be a good motivation to have a spin- and velocity - dependent expression for the electromagnetic potential between ionised spin-1 ( charge @xmath5 ) atoms and charged spin-1 nuclei or hypernuclei @xcite@xcite .",
    "we highlight here a particular feature of bosonic charge carriers as far as the electromagnetic interactions are concerned . from a purely macroscopic point of view",
    ", the maxwell equations address the problem of determining field configurations from given charge and current densities and a number of duly specified boundary conditions .",
    "they do not take into account the microscopic nature of these sources ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively ) . if a microscopic description of charged matter in terms of classical fields is given (",
    "based on a local @xmath2 symmetry ) , the particular aspects of the charge carriers become salient and london - type terms @xcite may arise . we shall be more specific about this point at the final section of our paper , where we render more evident the peculiarities of the spin of the charge carriers in the electromagnetic and general abelian interactions .",
    "our paper is outlined as follows : in section ii , we introduce the concept of potential and briefly discuss the kinematics involved , as well as present the notations and conventions employed . in section iii , we calculate the sources / currents and potentials , discussing the similarities between spin-1/2 and spin-1 matter .",
    "we consider , in section iv , another possible field representation for the spin-1 charged carrier , namely via a rank-2 tensor field , and we also work out the corresponding source / current@xmath8source / current interaction potentials .",
    "we present our conclusions and perspectives in section v. natural units are adopted throughout , where @xmath9 , and we assume @xmath10 .",
    "since we are interested in comparing the low - energy behavior of spin-1/2 and spin-1 as the interacting matter sector , it is convenient to work in the non - relativistic ( nr ) limit of the interactions . for simplicity",
    "we choose to work in the center of mass ( cm ) reference frame , in which particle 1 has initial and final 3-momenta given by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath13 is the average momentum of particle 1 before and after interaction , while @xmath14 is the momentum transfer carried by the intermediate boson - see fig ..     momenta assignments for the tree - level interaction between sources / currents 1 and 2.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the potential is calculated through the first born approximation @xcite , i.e. the fourier transform of the amplitude , @xmath15 , with respect to the momentum transfer @xmath16 where we explicitly assume that the amplitude contains terms dependent on the velocity of particle 1 .",
    "it is clear from the nr approximations of the sources / currents presented below that not only velocity - dependent terms will arise in the potentials , but also spin - dependent ones .",
    "this is due to our choice of keeping terms in the currents which go beyond the zeroth order , thus static , case @xcite .    in what follows",
    ", we shall consider only elastic interactions , which , together with energy conservation , imply @xmath17 and @xmath18 , pointing out that @xmath19 is a space - like 4-vector : @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , in the amplitude we will keep only terms up to second order in @xmath21 .",
    "the feynman rules for the tree - level diagram above are equivalent to taking @xmath22 as the interaction vertices , where @xmath23 are the matter sources / currents associated with particles 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding amplitude may then be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the momentum - space propagator of the intermediate boson with adequate lorentz indices as the case may be . in this paper , we are interested in interactions mediated by massive neutral scalars ( klein - gordon - type ) and spin-1 vector particles ( proca - type ) , whose momentum - space propagators are : @xmath26 and @xmath27    the sources / currents @xmath28 and @xmath29 , as representatives of the respective vertices , must translate the different possible couplings to the gauge sector : scalar , pseudo - scalar , vector and pseudo - vector .",
    "the vector currents are obtained from the lagrangian through the noether method , but , for the bosonic case , we consider only first order in the electromagnetic coupling constant , @xmath30 , since we wish to compute @xmath31 to second order in @xmath30 .",
    "we shall discuss this in more details in subsection b. the other sources / currents are built based on the principle that they should be bilinear in the field and its complex conjugate and reflect the desired symmetry .",
    "below , we recall some basic properties from spin-1/2 and spin-1 starting from the rest frame where the essential degrees of freedom become apparent , and then lorentz - boosting it to the lab frame",
    ". this will be important when we calculate the nr limit of each source / current and then apply them to extract the interparticle potential . here",
    ", we choose to work the spin-1 in its vector field representation , but , in section iv , we shall discuss it in its less usual tensor field representation @xcite@xcite@xcite .      for the sake of completeness , we present the well - known properties of dirac fermions .",
    "the dirac equation for the positive - energy spinors is , in momentum - space , @xmath32 u(p ) = 0 \\label{diraceq}\\ ] ] with the corresponding equation for the spinor conjugate , @xmath33 , with the attribution @xmath34 . by using the gamma matrices in the dirac representation",
    ", the positive - energy spinor can be explicitly written in the nr limit as @xmath35 with @xmath36 are the basic spinors satisfying @xmath37 and @xmath38 denotes a normalization constant . manipulating eq . and",
    "its conjugate , we obtain the gordon decomposition of the vector current , @xmath39 expressed in terms of the more convenient variables @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where we defined the spin matrix as @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "similar decompositions are also possible for other types of bilinear forms : for example , using eq . and",
    "its conjugate , we show that @xmath43    the gordon decomposition of the vector current associated with the noether theorem , eq . , yields a first term proportional to the density of the field ( @xmath44 ) , while the second one presents a coupling between momentum transfer , @xmath19 , and the spin matrix , @xmath45 , of the respective representation .",
    "this connection will be responsible for the zeroth order magnetic dipole moment interaction of the lepton with gyromagnetic ratio @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , this simple structure found for the gordon decomposition for the spin-1/2 will have a perfect analog in the spin-1 case , if we correctly include a non - minimal coupling - see subsection b.    our interparticle potentials shall be derived from the ( effective ) lagrangian describing the interactions between the exchanged ( scalar or vector ) particles and the sources / currents of the fermionic particle .",
    "it reads as follows below : @xmath47\\psi , \\label{lag_g_ferm}\\ ] ] where the different couplings are all dimensionless .",
    "the scalar ( s ) and pseudo - scalar ( ps ) sources are not conserved and , since we are dealing with a massive dirac field , we also have a non - conserved pseudo - vector ( pv ) current ( see eq . ) .",
    "as pointed out by boulware @xcite , the proca - type field , whenever coupled to a conserved current , leads to a renormalizable model .",
    "for this reason , we shall consider the coupling between the @xmath48 current and proca - type field as an effective interaction .",
    "the uv divergence does not harm our purposes here , since we are interested in the low - energy regime described by the interparticle potential .",
    "actually , our external ( on - shell ) sources / currents are tailored in the nr regime , meaning that we are working much below the scale where uv divergences show up .",
    "henceforth we shall denote the coupling constant @xmath49 whenever considering the electromagnetic interaction .      in the previous subsection",
    ", we have revised some basic aspects concerning spin-1/2 particles . here",
    ", we would like to follow up with a similar discussion for massive charged spin-1 particles in order to comparatively study how differently ( or not ) spin-1/2 and spin-1 sources / currents interact in the nr limit .",
    "we start off discussing the vector field representation for a massive charged spin-1 particle , whose dynamics can be obtained from the following lagrangian : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the mass and @xmath52 the gauge - covariant field strength , given by @xmath53 , with @xmath54 .",
    "the last term in eq . is a non - minimal coupling between the bosonic matter fields and the field - strength of the interaction mediator and its importance lies in the fact that it asserts that @xmath46 in tree - level for the spin-1 particle @xcite@xcite@xcite ( see also references therein ) .",
    "the field @xmath55 has , in principle , four degrees of freedom and these are reduced through the constraints introduced by the equations of motion , which read @xmath56 with analogue ones for the complex conjugated field .",
    "our goal is to characterize the source / current@xmath8 source / current interaction and for this , at tree - level , the aforementioned free source / current are to be described by bilinears in the spin-1 matter fields , where the derivatives are the ordinary ones . in other words , since the asymptotic states are the particle states composed only of @xmath57 fields ( we are now taking the free field equations ) , we have the subsidiary condition @xmath58 .",
    "this constraint is better seen in momentum - space , where we have @xmath59 , so that @xmath60 where , in order to avoid a cumbersome notation , we have used the same symbol to denote the field in position- and momentum - space , as there is no risk of confusion .",
    "this equation relates different components of the vector field and shows that the time - component is proportional to the longitudinal projection of @xmath61 and that @xmath62 is first - order in velocity , playing the role of a `` small '' component similar to the spin-1/2 case .",
    "it also allows us to write @xmath63 in its rest frame as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 stands for the dimensionless polarization 3-vector in the rest frame of the free particle and @xmath66 is a normalization constant .    the next step is to bring the system from rest into motion ( i.e. , to the lab frame ) via an appropriate lorentz transformation . in doing so",
    ", we obtain @xmath67 \\label{wlab}\\ ] ] and with this , two comments are in order :    * eq . tells us that , in the rest frame ( where @xmath68 ) , all the information about the vector field is contained in its spatial part . in this frame",
    "the only 3-vector available is the polarization , i.e. , its spin , which again enforces the vector character of the field . *",
    "the normalization constant is given by @xmath69 .",
    "we wish to make some considerations on the vector currents , both global and local , associated to the lagrangian . at the global stage ,",
    "i.e. , prior to the gauging of the @xmath2 symmetry , the noether current ( in configuration - space ) reads @xmath70 where no covariant derivative is involved , so @xmath71 . upon the gauging of the symmetry , and by including the non - minimal coupling g - term , the current changes into @xmath72    now , an important remark concerning current conservation : to calculate the current - current potential at the tree - level approximation ( one - boson exchange ) , as we are doing here , we actually only consider the current to the first order in @xmath30 .",
    "this amounts to neglecting the terms in the gauge potential present in the current in eq .. in other words : to calculate the potential to order @xmath73 , we consider the current only up to order @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , to the desired order in the coupling constant , the vector current is the globally conserved one , plus the non - minimal @xmath74-term . at this perturbative level ,",
    "the current @xmath75 is given by the global and non - minimal terms , as displayed in the second line of eq .",

    ", is remarkable .",
    "this gordon decomposition for spin-1 particles was found independently and agrees with the results of ref.@xcite .",

    "we also emphasize that the ( global ) @xmath48 bosonic current is conserved in a topological sense , i.e. , without making use of either the equations of motion or the symmetries of the lagrangian . as in the case of spin-1/2 ,",
    "the @xmath86 and @xmath84 sources for spin-1 are equally not conserved .    in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the momentum - space sources / currents for spin-1/2 and spin-1 in the nr limit and calculate the interparticle potentials generated by the exchange of scalar and vector mediating bosons .",
    "following the indications above , we present below the nr limit of the sources / currents , which may be extracted ( in configuration - space ) from lagrangians and as @xmath87 or @xmath88 , as the case may be . in the following ,",

    "let us be more specific : in order to evaluate the nr limit of these particular cases , we had to take into account the  weak \" contributions ( those with momenta ) of the fields , such as the components @xmath206 , @xmath207 , see eqs . and , respectively , and the analogues present in @xmath61 and @xmath208 .",
    "these different couplings between momenta and polarization , @xmath209 and @xmath210 , arise due to the lorentz boost to the lab frame and produce the observed longitudinal and transverse projections appearing in eqs . and above .",
    "these results ( eqs . and ) raise a question concerning the vector or axial character of the spin-1 particle . in the @xmath211-case , we are assuming a vector - like particle . in the tensor representation ,",
    "let us take the components as @xmath212 and @xmath213 . on - shell , in the rest frame of the particle , all the degrees of freedom ( d.f . )",
    "are carried by @xmath214 .",

    "if @xmath216 is vector - like , then @xmath218 must be axial , and vice - versa .",
    "therefore , we confirm that the minus sign difference highlighted above is always present as a consequence of the choice of representation ( vector or tensor ) , regardless of whether the particle is vector- or axial - like .    at this point , it is instructive to discuss why we do not observe functional differences in all sources / currents , but only a global ( numerical or mass ) factor .",

    "one can check that the next correction should be @xmath220 , which we are neglecting in this work .",
    "similar arguments apply to the other cases .",
    "therefore , we could only achieve possible different profiles in these currents if we consider the relativistic corrections to higher orders .    by using the same methodology as in section iii",

    "we emphasize that the differences are suppressed because they only show up in order @xmath227 in the amplitude .",
    "this is so because we are here bound to consider only dipole contributions .",
    "if we extend our calculations to also include quadrupole effects , the differences in the @xmath163 potentials for the vector and tensor representation of the spin-1 might become evident , as we could expect from the studies reported in ref .",
    "the consequences of the quadrupole moments of the two representations are interesting to be investigated and we intend to report on that in a forthcoming work @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we focused our attention on the special properties of the spin - spin dependence of the source / current@xmath8source / current interaction potential in the non - relativistic limit for spin-1 and spin-1/2 charged matter particles .",
    "our results indicate some universalities between bosons and fermions when exchanging scalar and vector particles .",
    "essentially , we observe very similar contributions in the spin - sector of the @xmath113 , @xmath133 , @xmath132 and @xmath163 potentials .",

    "even if the vector and tensor representations are equivalent on - shell ( and the particles in the source / current are on - shell ) , the results for the @xmath113 and @xmath163 potentials do differ .",
    "the justification was given in the aforementioned section and we claim that , by including higher - order terms in the relativistic corrections , quadrupole moments appear and the differences become explicit .    furthermore , we do not present a discussion on the bosonic and fermionic ( pseudo-)tensor currents exchanging a 2-form gauge field .",
    "however , according to preliminary results of a work in progress , it is worthwhile to comment that the case of bosonic sources / currents would yield interesting new interactions involving spin - polarization couplings , e.g. @xmath228 .    to close this report , we point out a question that might be addressed to with the help of our results on the comparison between the classes of potentials describing the interaction between spin-1/2 and spin-1 matter sources / currents . for the fermionic case , the electromagnetic potential does not couple to the particle density , as it happens instead for spin-0 and spin-1 charged matter .    if a charged spin-1 field , @xmath211 , is non - minimally coupled ( see eq . ) to the electromagnetic field , we have @xmath229   = \\ ] ] @xmath230 where @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",

    ", two interesting properties of the electromagnetic interactions of spin-1 matter fields are made explicit : the london - type term that couples @xmath234 to the density of carriers and the new interaction between the photon and the charged boson through their polarization vectors .",
    "these special aspects are expected to influence the inter - particle potential only if we take loop effects into account .    however , the @xmath235terms in eq . introduce singularities associated to the point - like idealization of spin-1 charged matter particles . the 1962 paper by dirac @xcite and the recent works by fabbri @xcite and dain @xcite address the issue of extensibility in connection with charged particles .",
    "in the present paper , we do not calculate classical field configurations generated by spin-1 currents ; instead , we build up interaction potentials by means of a semi - classical calculation , so we do not run into the complications yielded by the singularities mentioned above",
