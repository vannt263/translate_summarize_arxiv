    "bell inequalities play an important role in quantum physics .",
    "correlations in local classical theories are bounded by the bell inequality , which can be violated only by the presence of the non - local entanglement in quantum theories .",
    "the violation of bell inequality in the entangled einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pair , indicates that two particles have an `` instant interaction '' , in contrast to theories of hidden variables to preserve strict locality  @xcite .",
    "there are also some discussions about bell inequality in cosmology , to measure whether the origins of fluctuations are classical or quantum mechanical @xcite .",
    "recently , maldacena and susskind proposed the er = epr conjecture  @xcite , which stated that the quantum entanglement of the epr pair is related to the non - traversable einstein - rosen ( er ) bridge .",
    "it would be very interesting to further investigate how bell inequality is realized in this paradigm , such as whether the classical bulk geometry can produce the quantum behavior in bell inequality of the epr pair .    in this paper",
    ", we study the bell inequality in a particular holographic model of the epr pair proposed by jensen and karch @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , based on the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory(ads / cft ) correspondence @xcite .",
    "two particles of the boundary epr pair are connected by a string in the ads background of the bulk , where an er bridge lives on the string worldsheet .",
    "various studies of related models can also be found in @xcite .",
    "the two particles in the epr pair on the boundary are treated as probe particles in @xmath0=4 supersymmetric young - mills theory ( sym ) .",
    "thus , they do not change the ads geometry .",
    "we will use the chsh formulations of the bell inequality   @xcite , and identify the holographic schwinger - keldysh(sk ) correlator as the measurement of correlation between the two causally disconnected epr particles .",
    "we discuss the physical interpretation of the bell inequality in both the bulk and the dual boundary theories .",
    "the essence of bell inequality is captured in the chsh correlation parametrizations @xcite which is reviewed here briefly .",
    "the entangled states made of a pair of spin @xmath1 particles ( the generalization to particles of higher spin is straight forward ) are detected by two observers , alice and bob , respectively .",
    "the operators correspond to measuring the spin along various axes with outcomes of eigenvalues @xmath2 . performing the operations @xmath3 and @xmath4 on the first particle at alice s location , and operations @xmath5 and @xmath6 on the second particle at bob s location . with",
    "the pauli matrices @xmath7 , and normalized 3-vector @xmath8 to indicate the spatial direction of the measurement , we have the following operators @xmath9 then the chsh correlation formulation is introduced as @xmath10 which is a linear combination of crossed expectation values of the measurements . in a local classical theory with hidden variables the formula is bounded by the bell inequality @xmath11 . while in quantum mechanics , this inequality can be violated , with a higher bound @xmath12 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "for example , if we choose the entanglement state of a spin singlet @xmath13 plane , i.e. @xmath14 etc .",
    ", it is straightforward to show @xmath15 here @xmath16 depends on the cross angle of the measurements . and from we have @xmath17    in particular , if we fix the direction of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , as well as the angle between @xmath5 and @xmath6 as @xmath18 @xmath19 then we have the relation depended on the direction of @xmath20 , @xmath21 for @xmath22 , the bell inequality @xmath11 can be violated , and we reach the maximal violation at @xmath23 , with an extra factor of @xmath24 .",
    "now we will see what is the formula of bell inequality in the holographic model of epr pair in the next section .",
    "@xcite , it is proposed that an entangled color singlet quark anti - quark ( @xmath25-@xmath26 ) pair in sym can be described by an open string with both of its endpoints attached to the boundary of ads@xmath27 .",
    "the string connecting the pair is dual to the color fluxtube between the two quarks , with a @xmath28 coulomb potential as required by the scale invariance of boundary theory .",
    "note that there is no confinement in this theory , therefore the pair can separate arbitrarily far away from each other .    [ holobell ] ) -antiquark(@xmath26 ) epr pair in holography .",
    "the left(right ) world volume horizon depicts the horizon seen by @xmath25(@xmath26 ) in its co - moving frame .",
    "the bell inequality test is performed by spin measurements at alice and bob s locations .",
    "the ads blackhole is present only in the finite temperature case , which we briefly discuss in the last section .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] +    numerical solutions of the string shapes with different boundary behaviors can be found in  @xcite , and an analytic solution for an accelerating string was found in  @xcite . in the analytic solution",
    "the open string is also accelerated on the poincre patch of the ads@xmath27 @xmath29,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the ads radius @xmath30 and extra dimension @xmath31 .",
    "the string solution in the @xmath32 bulk is given by @xmath33 the quark and anti - quark live on the ads boundary @xmath34 .",
    "they are accelerating along the @xmath35 direction , respectively , with the solution @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , the two entangled particles are out of causal contact with each others .",
    "the question is , is the physics of entanglement in a single epr pair captured by the geometry of an er bridge on the string worldsheet in ads@xmath27 ?    _ string fluctuations. _ to consider the string fluctuations , we transform the solution to the co - moving spacetime @xmath37 of the accelerating quarks via @xmath38 these two frames , which cover the regions @xmath39 and @xmath40 separately , are accelerating frames with a constant acceleration @xmath41 along opposite directions of @xmath42 . and only maps the upper part of the string ( @xmath43 ) into the proper frames of the accelerating quarks with @xmath44 . plug this transformation in the string solution , the metric becomes @xmath45,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 .",
    "the event horizon @xmath47 separates the string into two causally disconnected parts .",
    "furthermore , the hawking temperature @xmath48 matches with the unruh temperature @xmath49",
    ".    let @xmath50 be the new worldsheet coordinates in the current frame .",
    "the spin measurement of the quarks can be carried out by the stern - gerlach type experiment which applied a magnetic field gradience to generate a force that acts on the spins of the quarks .",
    "this introduces fluctuations to the world lines of quarks which then propagate to introduce fluctuations to the world sheet of the string .",
    "thus , we can consider the string fluctuation as @xmath51 , with @xmath52 .",
    "when @xmath53 , the nambo - goto action of string becomes@xmath54 and @xmath55 is the tension of string .",
    "the equations of motion for the fluctuations on the string are @xmath56 performing a fourier transform , and assigning @xmath57 to @xmath58 @xmath59where @xmath60 is defined as the fourier transform of fluctuation on the boundary .",
    "following @xcite , one can compute the retarded green s function from the kinetic part of the action by using the ads / cft correspondence .    _ constructing bell s inequality. _ the retarded green s function of the quark under effective random force @xmath61 can be defined as @xmath62 \\rangle$ ] , where @xmath63 label the @xmath64 directions @xcite . in the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence , @xmath65 is the operator conjugate to the fluctuations @xmath66 , where the units have been restored with @xmath67 . in the low frequency limit @xmath68 , it can be obtained analytically as @xmath69and we have used the fact that @xmath70 .",
    "what we need for bell measurements are @xmath71 in holography , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are separately defined on the causally disconnected left and right wedges of penrose diagram , corresponding to the boundary of different patches of the ads space .",
    "this off - diagonal schwinger - keldysh propagator is examined in ref .",
    "@xcite and found to be related to the retarded green s function , @xmath74    for fluctuations coming from two causally separated quarks of an epr pair along @xmath58 directions , and in the low frequency limit @xmath68 , @xmath75 which indicates that the spatial correlator @xmath76 .",
    "the @xmath77 factor is consistent with the observation that the entanglement entropy of the entangled pair is of order @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting that this sk correlator does not vanish when the quarks are separated at long distance .",
    "this is consistent with the non - local nature of entanglement .",
    "however , the sk correlator vanishes when the acceleration @xmath78 becomes zero , which seems to indicate the system can not describe the entanglement between free particles .",
    "this is because the particles always experiences the @xmath28 potential in holography , so they never act like free particles .",
    "thus , we can only approach the free particle limit after we identify the spin correlation with the normalized operators as in the following eq.([operator ] ) in which @xmath78 dependence cancels .    to study the correlators , we normalize the operators such that only the dependence on the spin wave function remains : @xmath79 the mixed measurements for correlators in chsh correlation formulation become @xmath80 together with the similar normalization of the operators @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the chsh correlation formulations becomes@xmath83 for example ,",
    "when @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , we can reach the maximum value @xmath86 . in this derivation",
    ", we see the bulk string fluctuations , which come from classical gravity , reproduce the quantum entanglement of an epr pair on the boundary .",
    "if this derivation is correct , then there is no information propagating from quark to anti - quark through the string or vice versa since the quark pairs are not in causal contact .",
    "the entanglement is encoded in the fact that green s function is non - vanishing outside the horizon which is a familiar , yet mysterious , feature in ( both classical and quantum ) field theory .",
    "somehow the behaviors of the sk correlators outside the two horizons need to be correlated otherwise when they are extended insides the horizons the two extensions will not match . at this level of understanding ,",
    "entanglement is still a mysterious phenomenon .",
    "however , our work does lend further support to the intriguing er = epr conjecture .",
    "we have studied the bell inequality in a holographic model of a casually disconnected epr pair .",
    "the chsh form of bell inequality were computed using holographic schwinger - keldysh correlators .",
    "we have shown that the manifestation of quantum entanglement in bell inequality can be reproduced , through duality , from a purely classical theory , which is a gravitational theory living in the bulk .",
    "this interesting feature lends further support to the intriguing er = epr conjecture .",
    "we would also like to comment on the finite temperature effects on the accelerating string solution in ads@xmath87 black brane spacetime .",
    "although there is no analytical solution of the string expansion , qualitatively the string will touch the horizon of the black hole at late time .",
    "there is a semi - quantitative discussion in the small temperature limit @xcite , that the hawking temperature of the black hole is much smaller that the unruh temperature of the accelerating particle @xmath88 .",
    "an external electric field is imposed to accelerate the quark - antiquark pair from @xmath89 to @xmath90 .",
    "it is expected at late time energy is flowing into the system from the top of the string to the bottom part , and then being absorbed by the black brane . as time increases , the acceleration slows down and the string trajectory starts to evolve towards the trailing string solution .",
    "this corresponds to that the einstein - rose bridge is broken up by the horizon of ads black brane . and",
    "for the static string solution in the ads black brane where two straight strings is hanging down to the horizon , there is no entanglement in the dual state @xcite .    for our case in pure ads ,",
    "if we consider the back reaction after the measurements , the er bridge might be broken due to the energy injected by measurements , similar to the case with black brane .",
    "this is aligned with the fact that the wave function of the epr pair will collapse after the measurements .",
    "since the string is in probe limit , it is not explicit that the bridge will break due to the string perturbations .",
