    "studying low - energy @xmath4 and @xmath3 photoproduction presents an interesting opportunity to search for new baryon resonances .",

    "evidence was also found for contributions from other resonances at higher energies , along with strong @xmath18-channel contributions in the forward direction .",
    "the previously published clas @xmath3 results support contributions from several resonance states as well  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 results presented in this paper are more precise than any previous measurements and extend the large - angle energy range by approximately @xmath19  mev",
    ". they will provide stronger constraints on models that attempt to extract resonance contributions in this reaction .",
    "our @xmath4 measurements extend the energy range of the world s large - angle results by approximately @xmath5  mev .",
    "significant discrepancies exist between our @xmath4 results and those previously published by cb - elsa  @xcite at higher energies ( see section  [ section : results ] ) . these new results for both @xmath4 and @xmath3 will surely have an impact on the physics interpretation of these reactions .",
    "the data were obtained using the cebaf large acceptance spectrometer ( clas ) housed in hall b at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility in newport news , virginia . a 4  gev electron beam hitting a @xmath20 radiation length gold foil produced real photons via the bremsstrahlung process .",
    "the recoiling electrons were then analyzed using a dipole magnet and scintillator hodoscopes in order to obtain , or `` tag '' , the energy of the photons  @xcite .",
    "photons in the energy range from @xmath21 to @xmath22 of the electron beam energy were tagged and thus measured with an energy resolution of @xmath23 of the electron beam energy .",
    "the data were analyzed in center - of - mass energy bins that varied in width from @xmath24  mev up to @xmath25  mev , depending on the statistics .",
    "the physics target , which was filled with liquid hydrogen , was a @xmath25-cm long cylinder with a radius of @xmath26  cm .",
    "continuous monitoring of the temperature and pressure permitted determination of the density with uncertainty of @xmath27 .",
    "the target cell was surrounded by @xmath28 `` start counter '' scintillators that were used in the event trigger .",
    "the clas detector utilized a non - uniform toroidal magnetic field of peak strength near @xmath29  t in conjunction with drift chamber tracking to determine particle momenta .",
    "the detector was divided into six sectors , such that when viewed along the beam line it was six - fold symmetric .",
    "charged particles with laboratory polar angles in the range @xmath30 could be tracked over approximately @xmath31% of the azimuthal angle .",
    "a set of @xmath32 scintillators placed outside of the magnetic field region was used in the event trigger and during off - line analysis in order to determine time of flight ( tof ) of charged particles .",
    "the momentum resolution of the detector was , on average , about @xmath33% .",
    "other components of the clas , such as the cerenkov counters and the electromagnetic calorimeters , were not used in this analysis .",
    "a more detailed description of the clas can be found in reference  @xcite .",
    "the events were collected using a `` two - track '' trigger .",
    "this trigger required a coincidence between signals from the photon tagger and the clas .",

    "this run setup where only part of the tagger was included in the trigger was intended to mainly detect photons above @xmath35  gev , avoiding the large bremsstrahlung contribution from photons of lower energy .",
    "however , events originating from a photon of energy below @xmath35  gev ( corresponding to a hit in counters @xmath36-@xmath34 ) were recorded when they had an accidental ( random ) hit in one of the triggered tagger counters . by using these `` accidental '' events",
    ", we were able to collect data for photons with energies from @xmath37  gev to @xmath35  gev .",
    "this required applying an appropriate renormalization based on the probability for such a random coincidence to occur ( see sec .",
    "[ section : norm ] ) .",
    "the signal from the clas required at least two sector - based signals .",
    "these signals consisted of an or of any of the 4 start counter scintillators in coincidence with an or of any of the @xmath38 time - of - flight scintillators in the sector .",
    "the rate at which hadronic events were accumulated was about @xmath39  khz ; however , only a small fraction of these events contained the reactions of interest to the analysis presented here .",
    "the data reported here were obtained in the summer of 2004 during the clas `` g11a '' data taking period , in which approximately @xmath40 billion triggers were recorded .",
    "the relatively loose electronic trigger led to accumulation of data for a number of photoproduction reactions . during offline calibration , the timing of the photon tagger , the start counter and the time - of - flight elements were aligned with each other .",
    "calibrations were also made for the drift times of each of the drift chamber packages and the pulse heights of each of the time - of - flight counters . finally ,",
    "processing of the raw data was performed in order to reconstruct tracks in the drift chambers and match them with time - of - flight counter hits .",
    "the reconstructed tracks were corrected for small imperfections in the magnetic field map and drift chamber alignment , along with their mean energy losses as they passed through the target , the beam pipe , the start counter and air .",
    "in addition , small corrections were made to the incident photon energies to account for mechanical sag in the tagger hodoscope .",
    "the clas was optimized for detection of charged particles ; thus , the @xmath41 decay of the @xmath4 and the @xmath42 decay of the @xmath3 were used to select the reactions of interest in this analysis .",
    "detection of two positively charged particles and one negatively charged particle was required .",
    "a 1-constraint kinematic fit to the hypothesis @xmath43 was performed .",
    "this fit adjusts the momenta of all measured particles within their measurement errors such that energy and momentum are conserved and the missing mass is that of either a @xmath44 or an @xmath4 .",
    "the shifts in the momentum , combined with the known errors , yields a @xmath45 which is then converted to a probability ( confidence level ) that the event is the desired reaction .",

    "the difference between these two times was the measured time of flight , @xmath52 .",

    "in addition , events where the missing @xmath44 was moving along the beam line , @xmath67 , were cut in order to remove leakage from the @xmath48 reaction ( because of the very forward angle , the center - of - mass and lab angles are very similar , so a @xmath68 cut in the center of mass corresponds to an even tighter cut in the lab frame ) .",

    "the bin widths for the @xmath3 are the same as those used for the @xmath4 .",
    "in order to extract physical observables from the @xmath4 and @xmath3 photoproduction reactions studied here , it is necessary to separate background events from signal events .",
    "while such separation could be done via a simple side - band subtraction , our work on other reaction channels required the development of a more sophisticated event - based procedure .",
    "this event - based method , described in detail elsewhere  @xcite , was used to separate signal and background events .",
    "the procedure takes advantage of the fact that in the invariant mass distributions , the signal is a narrow structure , while the background is relatively featureless .",
    "the key feature of the procedure involves selecting each event s @xmath84 `` nearest neighbor '' events ( we chose @xmath85 ) using the quantity @xmath86 as a distance metric between events .",
    "each subset of @xmath87 events occupies a very small region of phase space .",
    "thus , the @xmath88 distributions could safely be used to determine the probability of each event being a signal event  the event s @xmath89-factor .",
    "the @xmath90/@xmath91 distributions in each event s nearest neighbor event samples are fit to a narrow gaussian ( signal ) plus a broad gaussian and linear ( background ) function to determine the @xmath89-factors . a few example invariant mass distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig - bkgd ] .",
    "note that such a distribution and fit are generated for each event in order to determine the @xmath89-factor for the event .",

    "the @xmath89-factors are also used to weight each event s contribution to the differential cross section .",
    "systematic studies were performed using different parametrizations of the background ( including up to fourth order polynomials ) . from these studies , the systematic uncertainty in the yield extraction due to the choice of background shape",
    "is estimated to be @xmath92%(@xmath93% ) for the @xmath94 analysis .",
    "the point - to - point uncertainties obtained from the individual fits varied depending on kinematics ; however , it was typically about @xmath95%@xmath39% .",
    "the typical method of computing a detector acceptance in a multi - particle final state such as those studied here is an iterative procedure to achieve a _ physics model_. to determine if the model is good , one generates a monte carlo sample thrown according to the model .",
    "these events are then passed through an accurate detector simulation and the resulting event distributions are then compared to the physics distributions for the signal events as measured in the detector . after many iterations of the physics model , the two distributions should agree .",
    "at that point , one is able to use the physics model and the monte carlo sample to compute the detector acceptance .",
    "there is an added complication to this procedure if there is background that is not easily separated from the signal .",
    "in such a case , one either needs to find a very clever way to effectively separate signal from background , or include the background events in the physics model .",
    "generally , one is required to iterate the physics and background models until satisfactory agreement has been reached .    in this analysis",
    ", we have taken a more systematic approach to computing the acceptance .",
    "first , we have used the @xmath89-factors discussed earlier to allow us to produce distributions of only signal events so that any model we use can ignore the background contribution .",
    "second , we have used the fact that one can always expand any distribution in terms of partial waves .",
    "thus our procedure involves determining a partial wave expansion ( our physics model ) , which will make the weighted monte carlo data agree with the observed signal sample .",
    "this partial wave expansion can be used to weight phase space generated events such that the monte carlo and data distributions agree .",
    "the efficiency of the detector was modeled using the standard clas geant - based simulation package and the monte carlo technique .",
    "a total of @xmath96 million @xmath4 and @xmath97 million @xmath3 events were generated pseudo - randomly , sampled from a phase space distribution .",
    "each particle was propagated from the event vertex through the clas resulting in a simulated set of detector signals for each track .",
    "the simulated events were then processed using the same reconstruction software as the real data . in order to account for the event trigger used in this experiment ( see section  [ section : setup ] ) , a study was performed to obtain the probability of a track satisfying the sector - based coincidences required by the trigger as a function of kinematics and struck detector elements .",

    "the measured rate of electrons detected by the tagger was used to compute the number of photons incident on the target by sampling tagger hits not in coincidence with the clas .",
    "these rates were integrated over the live - time of the experiment to obtain the total photon flux associated with each tagger element .",
