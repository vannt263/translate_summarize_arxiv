    "locating a @xmath17source in the sky is of primary importance in the case of galactic supernova ( sn ) explosions ; particularly if the sn is not optically visible , either because it is hidden behind the dust of the galactic disk , or because the light emission follows the neutrino burst by hours or days . in this latter case ,",
    "an early sn detection and location by neutrinos could allow observation of the evolution of the first optical stages .",
    "several pointing methods have been extensively discussed and compared in the literature @xcite,@xcite :    * the identification of @xmath18 scattering events ( a minority of the total number of events in most detectors ) ; * the pronounced anisotropy of the charged - current ( cc ) @xmath19 and @xmath20 reactions ; * the slight positron anisotropy in the cc reaction @xmath21 ; * the triangulation between at least three detectors .",
    "@xmath18 scattering events have an anisotropic angular distribution and , when observed in large detectors with good angular information , like the water erenkov detectors , permit localization of the sn .",
    "this technique was successfully applied to solar neutrinos by the kamiokande and the superkamiokande ( sk ) experiments@xcite .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that this method can determine the direction of a supernova , at a distance of 10 kpc , within a @xmath22 cone ( one  sigma angular width ) .",
    "the other methods mentioned above have less precise pointing capabilities .",
    "we show in this paper that , in the case of large scintillation detectors , another tool , based on the inverse - beta - decay reaction @xmath23    is also capable of providing a good determination of supernova direction .",
    "although the positron is emitted almost isotropically in this reaction , the neutron has an energy - dependent maximum angle of emission and an associated jacobian peak in its angular distribution .",
    "the neutron therefore retains a memory of the neutrino direction , which survives even after collisions with the protons of the moderating scintillator medium .",
    "a first study along this line @xcite was performed for the macro experiment and its sn detection capabilities , with results which were not encouraging . however , the single - vessel structure of the chooz experiment and its superior energy and position resolutions appeared more promising .",
    "an average displacement of neutrons with respect to positrons has been observed in previous reactor neutrino experiments @xcite . in chooz",
    "we were able to test this neutron recoil method and to use it for locating the reactor - neutrino source .",
    "the chooz experiment has also been a good test bench for our montecarlo simulations of the slowing down and capture of neutrons in a scintillator , and for our methods of event reconstruction in a single - vessel structure observed by photomultipliers .",
    "we believe that extrapolation from chooz to much larger volume scintillator detectors can be reliably made , and we therefore evaluate the sn locating capabilities of future scintillator detectors in the @xmath24 range , like borexino and kamland .",
    "@xmath25 s are detected in scintillator experiments via inverse - beta - decay ( reaction [ reaction ] ) .",
    "the @xmath25 signature is a delayed coincidence between the prompt @xmath26 signal ( boosted by the two 511 annihilation gamma rays ) and the signal from the neutron capture .",
    "the target material is a hydrogen  rich ( free protons ) paraffinic liquid scintillator ; in chooz the scintillator is loaded with gadolinium .",
    "the cross section for the @xmath25 capture process @xcite can be written for low energy antineutrinos as @xmath27    with the value of @xmath28 obtained from @xmath29-decay one derives the positron angular distribution in the laboratory @xmath30    this tiny anisotropy could in principle be employed if one had an extremely large number of events .",
    "but this is not normally the case for sn explosions nor was it for the chooz long - baseline reactor - neutrino experiment . in the case of chooz , by averaging eqn .",
    "[ angpos ] over the solid angle and positron spectrum , one obtains an average positron displacement with respect to the interaction of @xmath31 which , as we will see later , is not measurable with our spatial resolution and statistics . in @xcite the dependence of the @xmath32 coefficient on the positron energy",
    "is discussed .",
    "such a dependence does not affect the conclusions of this paper because the average positron displacement remains negligably small .",
    "figure [ tvsn ] ( right ) shows the scatter plot @xmath33 ( angle with respect to the incident neutrino direction ) versus @xmath34 ( kinetic energy ) for neutrons emitted in reaction [ reaction ] with our detected reactor - neutrino spectrum ( left ) .",
    "the neutron kinetic energy extends up to @xmath35 kev and the angle with respect to the incoming neutrino direction is limited to values below @xmath36 .",
    "the separated curves visible in the lower - left part of the picture are caused by the @xmath25 energy binning and by the logarithmic scale adopted for the x - axis .",
    "they show how the @xmath37 dependence changes as a function of the @xmath25 energy .",
    "the neutron slowing - down phase@xcite , in which its energy is reduced to the thermal equilibrium value , is a non - isotropic process which preserves a memory of the initial neutron direction . in each elastic scattering the average cosine of the outgoing neutron with respect to the incoming direction",
    "is :    @xmath38    where a is the atomic number of the scattering nucleus .",
    "the direction is therefore best preserved by scatterings on hydrogen , which in fact is the most probable occurrence since the elastic scattering cross section on hydrogen is larger than that on carbon for energies below @xmath39 .",
    "slowing - down is an extremely efficient process in which the neutron energy rapidly decreases ( an average factor of two for each scattering on hydrogen ) .",
    "since the scattering cross section is a decreasing function of the neutron energy , it follows that the neutron mean free path ( @xmath40 ) rapidly diminishes during moderation . as a matter of fact the distance from the production point travelled by neutrons before being thermalized is determined by the first two or three scatterings , in which a memory of the initial direction is preserved , according to eqn .",
    "[ cosine ] .",
    "the subsequent ( isotropic ) diffusion process does not alter the average neutron displacement along the neutrino direction . in chooz",
    "this average displacement is @xmath41 .    in table  [ neutrons ]",
    "we give some of the parameters characterizing the moderation and diffusion phases ( @xmath42 : average number of scatterings ; @xmath43 : time duration ; @xmath44 : average square distance , which does not include the neutron angular distribution of reaction [ reaction ] ) computed for neutrons from reactor - neutrino interactions in the chooz liquid scintillator .",
    ".parameters characterizing the neutron moderation and diffusion phases in chooz ( see text ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from this result it follows that the increase in the neutron production ",
    "capture distance dominates over the broadening of the possible neutron emission angles .",
    "the average positron  neutron displacement in this case turns out to be @xmath45 .",
    "we also investigated the effects on the direction determination of possible event- by - event cuts on the positron energy or on the positron  neutron distance .",
    "the only statistically significant ( though small ) improvement was obtained by requiring the positron ",
    "neutron distance to be larger than 20 cm , which corresponds to a reduction of the neutrino sample from @xmath46 to @xmath47 events .",
    "the results obtained applying this cut are also shown in table [ resultsmc ] .",
    "we finally point out that in the supernova case the background for reaction [ reaction ] is negligible since the duration of the neutrino burst is of the order of @xmath48 .",
    "the chooz experiment demonstrates for the first time the use of reaction [ reaction ] for measuring the average neutrino direction .    this technique could be important in supernov   neutrino detection with liquid scintillator - based experiments , which have the advantage of possessing a superior energy resolution compared to erenkov detectors .    by using the full chooz montecarlo simulation we showed that in an experiment with a sufficiently high mass and adequate position resolution , it is possible to measure the sky coordinates of a supernova at 10 kpc with an uncertainty larger by only a factor two ( @xmath49 compared to @xmath50 ) than that attainable by using the angular distribution of neutrino elastic scattering in sk .",
    "these results represent also an important check of the event reconstruction procedure of the chooz experiment and enhances our confidence in the analysis methods employed .",
    "construction of the laboratory was funded by lectricit de france ( edf ) .",
    "other work was supported in part by in2p3cnrs ( france ) , infn ( italy ) , the united states department of energy , and by rfbr ( russia ) .",
    "we are very grateful to the conseil gnral des ardennes for having provided us with the headquarters building for the experiment . at various stages during construction and running of the experiment , we benefited from the efficient work of personnel from sena ( socit electronuclaire des ardennes ) and from the edf chooz b nuclear plant .",
    "special thanks to the technical staff of our laboratories for their excellent work in designing and building the detector ."
