    "it would be of obvious interest if one could predict a forest fire .",
    "an attractive aim would be also to evaluate the risk of the forest fires in a given year , having the statistics of the fires in the past .",
    "here we argue that the time dependence of the forest area burned in a given year is inherently chaotic .",
    "this means that such predictions are not possible in longer time scale .",
    "the method used is the mean field equation based on an appropriate cellular automaton .",
    "cellular automata ( ca ) is a modern tool for qualitative simulations of numerous problems in statistical mechanics and theory of dynamical systems @xcite . in general , the rules of ca are probabilistic | they may depend on a random variable .",
    "when this dependence is absent , the automaton is termed deterministic .",
    "these automata are most exciting but least predictable .",
    "the behavior of a probabilistic cellular automaton can be predicted successfully @xcite by means of a nonlinear mean field equation .",
    "the solution is the time - dependent probability distribution of cell states .",
    "the approach is termed `` mean field '' , because the correlations between the states of neighboring cells are lost within one time step .",
    "however , they are lost also in the original probabilistic automaton after several time steps",
    ". similar technique can be applied also to investigate deterministic ca @xcite , but in this case the results of the mean field approximation are less reliable : the rules of an original deterministic automaton can preserve the correlations forever .    our aim here is to apply this mean field technique to the problem of the forest fires .",
    "the list of references of the problem is vast and reveals its numerous aspects , from purely computational to inherently biological ones @xcite . in particular ,",
    "some controversy has been mentioned @xcite on the applicability of the percolation theory @xcite , and on the size dependence of results of possible experiments .",
    "the advantage of the mean field approximation is that the finite - size fluctuations are eliminated .",
    "then , our results can be seen as a limit case both for simulations and experiments . below",
    "we demonstrate that the critical concentration for the percolation problem is fairly reproduced by the forest fire simulation , if the lattice is large enough .",
    "the approach can be formulated as follows : the model forest is a two - dimensional regular lattice .",
    "each cell at the lattice may be occupied by a tree with probability @xmath3 . during a year ( one time step ) , trees appear at empty cells with a probability @xmath4 , where @xmath3 is the previous concentration of trees per cell , and @xmath5 is a model control parameter . this nonlinear character of the probability reflects the obvious tendency that a new tree appears less likely if there is almost no free space around the cell .",
    "this kind of dependence is known as the verhulst term @xcite .",
    "all trees , those existing previously and those just grown , form clusters of different sizes .",
    "a cluster is a set of trees which are connected by nearest - neighbor bonds in the von neumann neighborhood .",
    "now , a probability that a cluster is ignited is proportional to its size .",
    "then , a fraction of the forest burned each summer is just the mean square of the cluster size .",
    "we will show that below the percolation threshold @xmath6 , this fraction is negligible . above this concentration ,",
    "most of the forest disappears | only small clusters survive .    summarizing our method ,",
    "the time evolution equation for the concentration of trees in the forest is a superposition of two maps , which describe a sequence of growing ( `` spring '' ) and fire ( `` summer '' )    [ eq_map ] @xmath7 where the map @xmath8 is @xmath9    and @xmath2 enumerates years , i.e. the time steps .",
    "the function @xmath10 is the burned fraction of the total area of the forest , i.e. the mean square of the cluster size .",
    "this fraction is evaluated by means of the hoshen ",
    "kopelman algorithm @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate , that the map @xmath0 leads to chaotic behavior .",
    "we note that such a conclusion is not entirely new . in 1990 ,",
    "chen , bak and jensen @xcite proposed a deterministic coupled map lattice @xcite for a model description of forest fires . in this model ,",
    "fire was introduced as a continuous process .",
    "the lyapunov exponent calculated there described the time evolution of the hamming distance between two nearby trajectories .",
    "initial distance was set by a random perturbation , added to each site at time @xmath11 .",
    "as the distance was found to increase with the power law , the value of the lyapunov exponent was zero .",
    "later on , this model was generalized by socolar , grinstein and jayaprakash @xcite by adding a parameter , which allowed to get a positive lyapunov exponent .",
    "both the above mentioned approach and this work have in common that they are computational rather than oriented to experiment .",
    "however , within this computational stream there are serious differences .",
    "the algorithm of chen et al .",
    "@xcite is deterministic .",
    "the forest fire is continuous ; a tree burns spontaneously as soon as it is large enough .",
    "our map can be treated as an extrapolation of the output of a probabilistic automaton to the area of infinite size .",
    "then , a sequential iteration is applied , and the season of growing and the season of fires are treated as two successive parts of one step of the iteration . from ref .",
    "@xcite we know that there are many uncontrolled quantities relevant to the problem : moisture , humidity , landscape , etc .",
    "as it is impossible to take them into account within a simple scheme , our probabilistic approach seems to be closer to reality .",
    "last but not least , our approach gives a sequence of yearly burned areas which , although expressed in arbitrary units , can be directly compared to available statistical data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ secnum ] we describe the way how the hoshen ",
    "kopelman is used here . there , two different kinds of statistics are assigned to casual ( lightnings ) and intentional ( `` human factor '' ) forest fires . in section [ secres ]",
    "the results on the lyapunov exponent and the bifurcation diagram are given .",
    "a remark is also added on the fire size distribution .",
    "the comparison of our results to the statistical data on forest fires in canada in years 19702000 @xcite is included in section [ secexp ] .",
    "the last section is devoted to discussion .",
    "with the hoshen  kopelman algorithm @xcite we are able to label all occupied sites on a @xmath12 large square lattice in such a way that the sites with the same label belong to the same cluster and different labels are associated to different clusters . in this way we get the cluster size distribution , which allows us to obtain the function @xmath10 and , in the next step , to formulate the mean field map given in eq . .",
    "the beauty of the hoshen  kopelman algorithm for the cluster characterization is that it goes through the lattice _ only _ once , and stores _ only _ the current line of the length @xmath13 .",
    "thus it is particularly useful for the bus - bar percolation problem investigation and it allows to check whether a given occupied site at distance @xmath14 from an arbitrary chosen ( usually the first and full occupied ) line is still connected to this line through the occupied sites in lines @xmath15 @xcite .    however , to construct the map it is necessary to evaluate the mean cluster size ( or its average mass ) @xmath16 .",
    "this requires an information on all bonds to sites at the distance @xmath14 from the first line also through the occupied sites at the lines @xmath17 , as it is presented on fig .",
    "[ fig_clu ] .     recognized as a part of the cluster ?",
    "algorithm goes from left to right , from top to bottom.,width=188 ]    this in turn requires storing of the whole lattice for all the time of simulation and passing through the lattice twice | what wastes computer memory and machine time , but ensures proper labeling of the clusters .",
    "the simulation is carried out on @xmath18 square lattice , with a fraction of @xmath19 occupied sites for different values of the initial trees concentration @xmath20 .",
    "an average concentration of trees in a `` green '' ( but soon `` red '' and consequently `` black '' ) cluster @xmath21 may be evaluated with two kinds of weights @xmath22 which describe the probability of finding a cluster of size @xmath23 on the lattice and the probability of choosing an @xmath24-th cluster among all other clusters , respectively .",
    "these statistics can be interpreted as reflecting the probability of a casual fire started from a lightning , which can strike at an empty cell ( @xmath25 ) , or of a fire started intentionally at a randomly selected tree ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the obtained map for each @xmath3 is the average over a hundred of independent lattice realizations .",
    "below we concentrate on the case of the fires of natural origin .",
    "the results for the other case will be only listed .",

    "two plots refer to two kinds of statistics , described in section [ secnum ] .",
    "we see that the plots are the same below the maximum of the curve , which is near the percolation limit for the square lattice @xmath28 @xcite . actually , below this limit",
    "both plots are identical to the curve @xmath19 from eq . .",
    "this means , that for @xmath29 the fires are negligible . above the percolation limit ,",
    "the curves remain similar for @xmath3 close to @xmath6 , but for higher @xmath3 the curve for the weight @xmath25 is remarkably higher , than the curve for the weight @xmath26 .",
    "it is clear that intentional fires ( @xmath26 ) are more devastating , because in this case it is sure that a tree is ignited .",

    "concluding , both the bifurcation diagram and the lyapunov exponent reveal that chaos is indeed present in the time evolution of the forest fire .",
