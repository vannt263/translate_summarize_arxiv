    "therefore , considering the family @xmath156 of exponentiated hencky energies , the main result of this paper shows the following inacceptable feature : even if the elastic energy is everywhere rank - one convex as a function of @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath157 is rank - one convex , the new function @xmath158 need not remain rank - one convex at some given plastic stretch @xmath5 ( viz .",

    "we demonstrate that , relative to an initial natural configuration prior to the occurrence of further yielding , the elastic rank - one convexity property may be lost with development of plastic flow alone .",
    "we note again that this type of degenerate response can not occur in elasto plasticity based on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into incompatible elastic and plastic distortion @xmath159 , thus giving more credit to these latter type of models .",
