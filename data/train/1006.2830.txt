    "the formation and evolution of massive elliptical ( passive ) galaxies in the universe is interesting for both studies of galaxy evolution and cosmology . in the former case ,",
    "such galaxies present an observational challenge for hierarchical models of structure formation , as some form of feedback is required to suppress on - going star formation in such massive systems ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for cosmology , such massive ellipticals can be used to directly constrain cosmological parameters ( e.g. , as standard candles ; @xcite ) and provide efficient tracers of the large scale structure ( lss ) in the universe @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the ( relative ) ages of massive ellipticals , as a function of redshift , offers the possibility of directly constraining the hubble parameter , thus providing vital information on the expansion history of the universe and therefore , the equation of state of dark energy ( see @xcite for a discussion of the underlying concept , and @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite for observational constraints obtained from using this technique ) .    in this paper , we revisit the techniques used to constrain cosmological parameters through the age  redshift relationship of passive ( elliptical ) , massive galaxies . in detail",
    ", we present a new analysis of the ages of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ; @xcite ) , as selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "the key difference present herein compared to other such work with sdss spectral data ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) is that we calibrate , for the first time , the sdss spectra onto the well - known , and well - studied , lick / ids system ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , thus allowing us to exploit a host of previous work on this system including the simple stellar population ( ssp ) modeling in the literature ( @xcite ; @xcite ; ) and comparisons with lick measurements in the literature . in a companion paper , we will use the age ",
    "redshift data derived for sdss lrgs in this paper to obtain cosmological constraints .",
    "in section 2 of this paper , we outline the sdss galaxy data we use to construct our age  redshift relation , specifically luminous ( massive ) , quiescent galaxies .",
    "we also discuss the stellar data available to calibrate these galaxies onto the lick / ids system ( see also appendix a ) . in section 3 ,",
    "we provide details about the ssp models we have used to determine the ages , metallicities and @xmath4enhancements of our galaxies , using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) technique for parameter estimation .",
    "we discuss our results in section 4 , including the effect of priors , and conclude in section 5 .",
    "appendix a provides the extensive details on how we calibrate the sdss spectra onto the lick / ids system , including all the necessary corrections made to the data . in appendix b , we provide a review of tests we have performed to quantify the robustness of our spectral measurements , including comparisons with data from the literature .",
    "we assume a concordance , flat @xmath7cdm cosmology , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where required .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) is a photometric and spectroscopic survey , covering @xmath10 of the northern sky , using a 2.5 meter telescope at apache point observatory in new mexico , usa . the photometric survey consists of simultaneous observations of the sky using 5 optical filters ( _ u , g , r , i _ and _ z _ ) , providing a database of hundreds of millions of detected objects all with accurate photometric and astrometric calibrations @xcite .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic galaxy survey consists of two samples of galaxies selected using different criteria ; namely the main sample @xcite and the lrg sample @xcite .",
    "the sdss spectra of these galaxies span a wavelength range of @xmath11 with a median resolution of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , which is approximately @xmath14 ( although this varies as a function of wavelength and is different for each fiber ) .",
    "the sdss spectra are automatically reduced using dedicated software , which flux calibrates the spectra and references them to the heliocentric frame and converts to vacuum wavelengths .",
    "the software also measures a redshift for each object and measures a series of spectral features consistent ( in their wavelength definitions ) as the standard lick indices ( see section 2.2 ) , but are not calibrated onto the lick systems as no attempt has been made to match to the resolution of the lick / ids system .    for the analysis presented in this paper",
    ", we do not use the lick indices measurements from the standard sdss pipeline , but instead determine our own line - strengths after matching the instrumental resolutions ( see section  [ sec : lick_calib ] ) .",
    "however , we do use redshifts ( ` z ` ) , velocity dispersions ( ` veldisp ` ) , magnitudes ( ` u , g , r , i , z ` ) and other derived quantities such as the _ r_-band de vaucouleurs radii ( ` devrad_r ` ) and the _ r_-band de vaucouleurs profile axis ratio ( ` devab_r ` ) from the standard sdss spectral pipeline , made available through the catalog archive server ( cas ) .",
    "the spectral data used in this paper was obtained from the data archive server ( das ) .      for our analysis ,",
    "we only used cut i luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) as outlined in @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by selecting objects from cas using the ` target_galaxy_red ` flag , thus yielding a pseudo volume - limited sample of lrgs between @xmath15 . below @xmath16 contamination by low redshift star - forming galaxies",
    "increases the space density of galaxies that satisfy the sdss lrg colour - colour selection , while above @xmath17 the space density of sdss lrgs decreases due to the @xmath18 break dropping out of the sdss @xmath19-band .",
    "we do not use the cut ii lrg sample at @xmath20 as we require velocity dispersion measurements for each object and these are not supplied above this redshift .",
    "therefore , we impose an upper redshift limit of @xmath21 in our sample and analysis .",
    "we further restrict our sample to only include lrgs with ` specclass eq spec_galaxy ` ( spectrum classified as a galaxy ) , ` zstat eq xcorr_hic ` ( redshift obtained from cross - correlation with a template ) , ` zwarning eq 0 ` ( no warning flags on the redshift ) , ` eclass < 0 ` ( indicates an old stellar population ) , ` z < 0.4 ` ( redshift less than 0.4 ) and ` fracdev_r > 0.8 ` ( indicating a surface brightness profile best fit by a de vaucouleurs profile ) . based upon these selection criteria ,",
    "we obtain a sample of approximately @xmath22 lrgs ( see figure  [ fig : z_dist_quiescent ] for the redshift distribution of this sample ) .          at low redshift",
    ", our sample will be contaminated by bulges in late - type galaxies due to the fiber size ( 3 ) of the sdss spectrographs . to reduce this contamination , and increase the number of truly quiescent galaxies in our sample , we make further cuts based on the emission line properties of our lrg sample , e.g. , we use standard emission lines such as @xmath23 , @xmath24and @xmath25}}\\lambda5007",
    "$ ] @xcite .",
    "if left unchecked , such nebular emission , or emission associated with low - ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ) activity , would confuse our interpretation of the ssp parameters derived from these objects .    to combat this , we use the mpa - jhu spectral line data to select only those objects that are consistent with zero emission . in their original work , @xcite fitted the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of @xcite to the sdss galaxy spectra in data release four ( dr4 ) , subtracted off the best fitting sed , and then measured the line - strengths of @xmath26$]@xmath27 , @xmath24 , @xmath28$]@xmath29 , @xmath30$]@xmath31 , @xmath23 and @xmath32$]@xmath33 .",
    "this sed fitting approach has now been applied to the sdss data release seven ( dr7 ) dataset using the stellar population synthesis spectra of charlot & bruzual ( 2008 ) .",
    "we use this latest dr7 dataset herein .    in an approach similar to @xcite",
    "we fit a two component function to the line - strength distributions of @xcite , that consists of a normal component to describe the quiescent lrgs , plus a log - normal component to describe the active objects .",
    "the best fit is then used to determine the small zero - point offsets that exist in the dataset of @xcite from which we then select objects that are consistent with zero emission , at the @xmath34 level , in @xmath23 and @xmath26 $ ] , hence removing the need to make corrections to the lick index line - strengths for the possible presence of nebular emission . with these constraints on the emission - line characteristics of the lrg sample , we obtain approximately @xmath35 galaxies that we refer to as the quiescent lrg sample .    while it is possible to use different , and more , emission lines in determining the quiescent sample , doing so results in a significant reduction of our sample size .",
    "for instance , including @xmath24and @xmath28 $ ] in the joint constraint with @xmath23 and @xmath26 $ ] yields approximately @xmath36 lrgs over @xmath1 and further inclusion of @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath32 $ ] constraints yields approximately @xmath37 objects .",
    "while the more restrictive sample selection ensures a more quiescent sample , the reduction in the total number of objects available hampers our ability to explore the evolution of the ssp parameters over the desired redshift range .",
    "but , even selecting on @xmath23 and @xmath26 $ ] alone helps to ensure that we are not including objects with significant emission in @xmath24as show in figure  [ fig : quiescent_ew_contours ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : z_dist_quiescent ] we also show the redshift distribution of the quiescent lrgs sample .          in order to select the same population of objects over the redshift range",
    "@xmath38 we need to select on physical properties such as velocity dispersion and absolute luminosity .",
    "aperture corrections are applied to the sdss velocity dispersion measurements following the approaches of @xcite and @xcite , see section  [ sec : ap_corr ] . to select on luminosity",
    "we have performed k - corrections using the code _ kcorrect _ code of @xcite and have k - corrected all galaxies to a redshift of 0.2 ( the median of our distribution ) in order to minimise errors in these k - corrections .",
    "we have modeled the luminosity evolution in our lrgs using a simple linear fit to the volume limited part of the k - corrected , magnitude - redshift distribution and then extrapolated this to higher and lower redshifts , see figure  [ fig : quies_lum_evolve_contour ] . from this , we obtain an evolutionary ( e ) correction which we apply to our quiescent lrg sample . a more detailed approach to determine the evolution correction using stellar population synthesis models is unlikely to significantly improve the accuracy of the e - correction given the difficulty that current models have in explaining the evolution of the sdss lrgs colours @xcite .      after correcting velocity dispersions for aperture effects and performing k+e corrections to the magnitudes , we have produced four subsamples of quiescent lrgs ( see table 2 for numbers in each sample ) .",
    "these subsamples span an intervals of @xmath41 and @xmath42 and are shown as the boxed regions in figure  [ fig : quies_slices_contour ] .",
    "objects satisfying these criteria are then co - added to produce high signal - to - noise spectra after binning into redshift intervals of @xmath43 .",
    "this redshift interval is small enough that there is little evolution in the ages of the objects within the bin such that we are co - adding objects of sufficiently similar ages , e.g. in the case of a concordance cosmology the age evolution within a bin is approximately 0.2 gyr over the redshift range @xmath38 , and is big enough to yield a sufficient number of objects to reach s",
    "/ n levels of approximately @xmath44    in generating the co - added spectrum we have adopted an approach similar to @xcite . briefly , after binning our sample in redshift , absolute magnitude and velocity dispersion we shift each spectrum to its restframe .",
    "all spectra in a given bin are normalised to the median flux in the region @xmath45 and combined pixel - by - pixel using a weighted arithmetic mean where the weights are determined by the inverse variance of the flux in each pixel .",
    "this approach means that not all spectra contribute equally to the co - added spectrum but it does mean that those pixels contaminated by residuals from imperfect sky - subtraction contribute less to the final stacked spectrum .",
    "a long term programme undertaken by @xcite and @xcite , amongst others , has yielded a library of stellar spectra , obtained with the image dissector scanner ( ids , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the shane 3 m telescope at the lick observatory .",
    "these authors have also established a spectral index system used to investigate element abundances from low - resolution integrated spectra of extragalactic stellar populations .",
    "twenty five absorption features in the wavelength range @xmath46 at @xmath47 resolution , have been identified that are sensitive to effective temperature ( @xmath48 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath19 ) and metallicity ( @xmath49 ) of a star .",
    "the wavelength definitions of these features were chosen such that the broad absorption features found in elliptical galaxies could be studied and to minimise the effect of galaxy velocity dispersion on the measured line - strengths .",
    "all features measured on the lick / ids system are defined by a central `` feature '' bandpass and two adjacent `` pseudocontinuum '' bandpasses , see appendix  [ sec : lick_calib ] . from this continuum and feature",
    "it is possible to measure a `` pseudo '' equivalent width ( ew ) .",
    "it is not a true ew as the wavelength definitions for the bandpasses are fixed and , depending on the element abundances , instrumental resolution or velocity dispersion of the stellar population , the wings of an absorption feature may extend beyond the feature bandpass .    as a consequence of adopting fixed wavelengths to determine the continuum and feature fluxes ,",
    "the measured line - strength depends on the flux in the continua bandpasses as well as the feature bandpass .",
    "the continua also contain absorption features which , when coupled to the effects of galaxy velocity dispersions and instrumental resolution , will help suppress its average flux",
    ".    other factors that effect the measured line - strength of absorption features are gas , dust and telluric features .",
    "although dust has little effect due to the generally narrow nature of the features , gas can be a problem .",
    "nebular emission will contaminate the measured line - strength of the balmer lines by filling in the `` natural '' absorption ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and , when using the @xmath24absorption index , will lead to incorrectly determining older ages for stellar populations . while the @xmath24index line - strength is directly affected by balmer emission from ionized gas , some indices are indirectly affected by emission , e.g. the red sideband of @xmath50can be contaminated by @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "telluric emission and absorption can also have a significant impact on the accuracy of the measured line - strengths , but stacking spectra in order to improve the s / n of the lick indices also allows us to minimise the impact from these telluric features .",
    "by co - adding spectra at different redshifts , telluric features `` appear '' at different restframe wavelengths in the deredshifted spectra .",
    "using the inverse variance of the flux when weighting each pixel allows us to minimise the impact from these features on the final stacked spectrum .",
    "it should be noted that the sdss convention is to present all wavelengths as vacuum wavelengths .",
    "therefore , the wavelength definitions of all lick indices were converted to vacuum wavelengths @xcite prior to performing any measurements of index line - strengths on spectra . we have used the publicly ",
    "available software indexf @xcite to measure our absorption feature line - strengths from our co - added stacked lrg spectra .      to properly calibrate to the lick / ids",
    "system it is necessary to have sdss observations of lick stars , or galaxies , to allow the zero - point offsets to be determined , see appendix  [ sec : transform ] .",
    "the library of lick stars that could be used in calibrating the sdss to the lick system have not been intentionally targeted by the sdss and therefore requires serendipitous observations of lick stars to allow the sdss to be placed on the lick system .",
    "the diameter of the sdss fibres is @xmath52 with the median seeing at apache point of @xmath53 .",
    "we have therefore chosen a cut - off of @xmath54 when matching sdss objects and lick star coordinates . in searching for lick stars in the sdss",
    "we have included both _",
    "special _ and _ survey _ plates in the search and have identified 13 stars from the lick library that match sdss objects to within @xmath55 ; 11 stars in m67 ( _ special plate _ ` # ` 0321 ) and 2 stars in ngc 7789 ( _ special plate _ ` # ` 2377 ) and are listed in table  [ tab : lick_stars ] .",
    "the cluster proper motion dispersion for m67 is @xmath56 and for ngc 7789 is @xmath57 , with only one star in table  [ tab : lick_stars ] having a measured proper motion of @xmath58 for m67 f 164 . given the small size of the proper motions we have ignored this effect when matching the coordinates of sdss objects to the lick stars in these two clusters .",
