    "the evolution of the mass function of galaxy clusters is sensitively related to cosmology via the dynamically opposing effects of gravity and the cosmological acceleration ( see @xcite for a thorough review ) .",
    "it has been claimed that with only a few hundred massive clusters below redshift @xmath4 , competitive constraints on the standard cosmological model and a consistency check of the viability of general relativity on cluster scales can be achieved @xcite . in terms of the standard model the parameters most sensitively constrained are the normalization of the mass function , @xmath5 , and the cosmological mean matter density , @xmath6 .",
    "these parameters can in principle be constrained using the most massive clusters @xcite .",
    "currently the samples of clusters constructed for these purposes are x - ray or sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect selected so that the masses are generally inferred from indirect scalings derived from other samples of clusters at lower redshift related to lensing and/or internal dynamics .",
    "efforts are underway to obtain accurate masses of sizable samples of massive clusters from deep multi - band lensing observations , such as the clash survey @xcite and the `` weighing the giants '' project @xcite .",
    "these samples are a substantial step forward in that lensing based masses are constructed but they still rely on x - ray selection , with a significant scatter and the potential for serious biases when inferring masses indirectly this way @xcite . ideally the sample selection would be best made by selecting clusters in a volume limited way from densely sampled redshift surveys with masses obtained by weak lensing .",
    "large surveys with the resolution for weak lensing work are underway : hsc @xcite , jpas @xcite and planned eboss , large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) , euclid , wide - field infrared survey telescope ( wfirst ) , and the dark energy survey ( des ) , but currently no statistical sample of clusters selected this way exists .    the relation between richness and mass has been shown to be fraught with systematic uncertainty @xcite related perhaps mainly to the complexities of gas physics that may be expected to significantly complicate the conversion of x - ray or sz luminosities to total cluster mass .",
    "weak lensing mass measurements for subsamples of relaxed clusters can help reduce the scatter in mass - observable scaling relations @xcite .",
    "recent cluster weak lensing efforts with deep subaru observations have achieved an accuracy of sub-10% in the overall cluster mass calibration @xcite , which is currently limited by relatively small sample sizes .",
    "while we await the new lensing surveys , we can examine the new optically selected samples of clusters constructed from the huge volume observed by the sdss and boss surveys for which many tens of thousands of clusters have been painstakingly identified independently by several groups using different cluster finding algorithms .    among some of the recent ones , based on sdss data , we find the maxbcg catalogue @xcite , which is based on red - sequence cluster detection techniques and provided 13,823 clusters with photometric redshifts ( hereafter photo-@xmath7 s ) using sdss dr5 data .",
    "@xcite , using an adaptive matched filter ( amf ) cluster finder @xcite , presented an optical catalogue of 69,173 clusters in the redshift range @xmath8 , based on sdss dr6 data .",
    "this catalog , differing from others , did not rely on the presence of a luminous central galaxy in order to detect and measure the properties of the cluster , but provided a catalogue with the three brightest galaxies associated to them . using also dr6 photometric data",

    "the masses of the groups are estimated using the velocity dispersion measurements via the virial theorem , and although 82,458 groups are found , only around 2,000 of them have masses above @xmath11 .",
    "the camira algorithm by @xcite , based on colour prediction of red - sequence galaxies in clusters , provides richness and photometric redshift estimates for 71,743 clusters in the @xmath12 redshift range using sdss dr8 photometric data .    using three of the largest cluster catalogues produced to date , and described in the next section , we relate the optical richness to statistical measures of mass related observables , in particular we focus here on the effects of gravitational redshift and gravitational magnification .",
    "the effect of gravitational redshift is simply a consequence of the reduced frequency of light observed for objects emitting from a lower gravitational potential relative to the observer .",
    "this relativistic effect has been advocated in terms of the change in frequency of emission lines present in the hot cluster gas @xcite which may be applied to individual relaxed clusters where bulk gas motions do not dominate .",
    "this new observational signature of clusters differs from others , in the sense that it provides a novel and unique way to test gravity , as modified gravity could lead to deeper potential wells inside clusters , and thus , stronger gravitational redshift than the one predicted by general relativity @xcite .",
    "a statistical effect on the redshifts of member galaxies has been claimed to be detected for optically selected stacked cluster samples from the sdss survey @xcite , for which the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) is found to lie systemically offset in velocity relative to other member galaxies .",
    "the sense of this effect is opposite to that induced by tangential motion @xcite and other effects related to galaxy kinematics @xcite .",
    "all these effects combined induce a new asymmetry on the cross - correlation function @xcite , different from the well known redshift - space distortion asymmetry , as it depends not only on the absolute value of the line - of - sight separation from the center of the cluster , but also on its sign .    the magnification bias effect that we explore here",
    "is related to the increased flux from background galaxies , which promotes galaxies above the flux limit whilst magnifying the area of sky over which they are detected , leading to greater depth for luminous background galaxies @xcite .",
    "a significant detection of this redshift enhancement effect has been reported recently by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , cbu13 ) combining sdss clusters and lensing background galaxies from the boss survey . here",
    "we explore this effect further with the new data releases in an enlarged sample of clusters and background galaxies , allowing new correlations to be examined in this context .",
    "this effect has the advantage over weak lensing estimated from shear to be free from the large intrinsic and instrumental shape dispersion .",
    "it requires on the other hand a clean sample of background galaxies with accurate spectroscopic redshifts , limited to fewer galaxies .",
    "individual massive clusters now routinely provide a measurement of magnification bias , in terms of the background counts .",
    "this effect is a projection over the integrated luminosity function described above , which it has been shown reduces significantly the surface number density of red background galaxies behind individual clusters @xcite and similar effects are claimed for background qso s and lyman break galaxies @xcite .",
    "the expansion of the sky by magnification is found to dominate over the opposing increase from objects promoted from lower luminosity above the flux limit .",
    "the requirement for this is deep imaging @xcite , so that this effect can be traced with sufficient numbers over several independent radial bins per cluster .",
    "@xcite have shown that this effect can significantly enhance the accuracy of lensing derived cluster masses when added to weak shear measurements .    in this study",
    "we provide these two independent gravitational measurements for the three large stacked samples of sdss clusters described in section [ sect : data ] . in section [",

    "the sdss covers a unique footprint of 14,555 deg@xmath17 of sky , and comprises optical imaging data of nearly 500 million unique objects in five filters ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath7 ) and over 1,600,000 unique spectra obtained with the original sdss spectrograph ( 640 spectroscopic fibers per plate ) under the legacy programme .",
    "the ongoing boss programme aims at complementing the spectroscopic sample with a total of 1,400,000 color - selected galaxies in the range @xmath22 with the newly installed boss spectrograph ( 1,000 fibers per plate , @xcite ) .",
    "here we use the dr10 release which contains all galaxies with reliable spectroscopic measurements from the legacy programme plus more than 850,000 galaxies from the boss programme .",
    "large numbers of clusters with spectroscopic redshift measurements are needed to statistically investigate their gravitational redshift and lensing properties , so here we will focus our study on the three catalogues described below , which offer the largest samples useful for us to date . throughout this paper",

    "the sdss photometric and redshift catalogues are used to determine bcg candidates . to estimate the richness @xmath24 of the cluster , a combination of gaussian fitters in colour space is used to identify overdensities around a bcg candidate among galaxies brighter than @xmath25 ( see @xcite ) , closer than 0.5mpc from the bcg , and within a photo-@xmath7 range of @xmath26 .",

    "an important result of their study is that , above masses @xmath74 , the gravitational redshift signal is proportional to the cluster velocity dispersion , and hence , the number of clusters actually needed to detect the gravitational redshift signal does not depend on the mass of the clusters used .",
    "this is because the dispersion in the velocity difference between the bcg and the rest of the galaxies is found to increase with cluster mass in the simulations , adding to the inherent noise .",
    "they stress that a convincing detection would require sufficient data so that independent mass bins can be compared to examine the signature of gravitational redshift as a function of cluster mass .    shortly after the @xcite claim , @xcite pointed out a potentially significant additional new blueshift deviation effect related to the special relativistic transverse doppler effect ( td ) generated by random motion of the galaxies moving within the cluster potential .",
    "this additional shift @xmath78 is equal to @xmath79 , opposite in sign to the gr shift , and of the same order of magnitude for clusters in virial equilibrium .",
    "in fact , for an spherical cluster in equilibrium , this yields @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the observed line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the galaxies around the bcg , and @xmath82 is the velocity dispersion associated to bcgs , which is taken to be @xmath83 by @xcite and @xcite    more recently , @xcite has raised other significant corrections . as we are observing galaxies in our past light cone ( lc ) , and due to the time it takes light to travel trough the cluster",
    ", we will see on average more galaxies moving away from us than toward us .",
    "this effect is compared by @xcite to the one that `` causes a runner on a trail to meet more hikers coming toward her than going in the same direction '' .",
    "this results in another shift of the distribution of galaxies around the bcgs equal to @xmath84 , equal in sign to the td effect , and of the same order of magnitude .",
    "in addition to that , according to @xcite we also have to deal with the fact that we are working with a magnitude - limited sample of galaxies : although the cluster catalogues , that are obtained using photometric data , are claimed to be volume complete up to a certain redshift limit @xmath28 , the sample of galaxies with measured redshifts is usually magnitude - limited , so that proper motion , changing the surface brightness ( sb ) , or equivalently the apparent luminosity of galaxies due to the relativistic beaming effect , will bias the distribution of galaxies selected within clusters . for low velocities , this change in the luminosity is equal to @xmath85 , with @xmath86 the apparent luminosity of the galaxy , and @xmath87 the effective spectral index that takes into account the change in frequency and the resulting response of the photon count detector to this change .",

    "this density modulation introduces a change on the observed distribution of galaxies equal to @xmath92 . in opposition to the others td and lc dynamical effects",
    ", this new shift introduces a net blue - shift , also of the same order of magnitude .",

    "the main difference between these two catalogues , i.e. , whl12 ranging to higher masses , does not change the shape of the model curve too much as the contribution coming from high mass clusters is highly suppressed by the low values of the mass function distribution at these scales .",
    "the redmapper model curve , in the other hand , predicts a higher signal , which is consistent with the fact that redmapper minimum mass cutoff is much more conservative than gmbcg and whl12 ones , resulting in a higher average cluster mass .      in order to study the spatial distribution of galaxies around clusters ,",
    "first , we carefully remove the identified bcgs of the cluster catalogues from the sdss galaxy catalogues . here",

    "this leaves us with a sample of 4,278 objects , with mean richness 18 ( corresponding to @xmath136 ) , and mean redshift @xmath137 .",

    "our measurements are compatible with those obtained by @xcite , the difference between them coming from the different radial binning used .",
    "we also divide the data into different mass bins in order to test how this measurement may change with cluster mass . as before , we select only those clusters with 6 spectroscopic bcg - galaxy pairs or more . then , we divide the resulting sample into 3 different mass subsamples . for each of these subsamples we would like to measure the integrated signal up to a certain radius @xmath99 , but , as we expect cluster size to increase with richness , a galaxy at , say , a distance of 0.5mpc from a high richness cluster s bcg would be deeper in the gravitational potential than a galaxy 0.5mpc away from a low richness cluster s bcg .",
    "so , in order to make the measurements more comparable , we convert projected @xmath99 radial distances from the bcgs into @xmath140 units , i.e. , we rescale the comoving transverse distances of the galaxies that belong to a particular cluster using the @xmath141 estimate of that cluster , obtained assuming a nfw halo density profile , and using the concentration - mass relations provided by @xcite , as explained before in sec .

    "even worse , the second and third radial bins , centered at 1.75mpc and 3.5mpc , display positive values of @xmath150kms@xmath2 .",
    "the number of clusters contained in the catalogue is large enough as to split it into different mass bins and still have enough number of objects to have a decent signal - to - noise ratio , so we proceed now to do it in order to test the reliability of this detection . in this case",

    "the @xmath132 value obtained from the first mass subsample , with an average @xmath151 , seems to be in agreement with the model prediction , but the signal obtained is very weak , compatible with zero at the @xmath77 level .",
    "the second and third mass subsamples , with average masses around 1.1 and @xmath152 , show positive values of @xmath132 .",
    "however , the fourth and fifth mass subsamples , whose average masses are @xmath153 and @xmath154 respectively , with values of @xmath132 equal to @xmath155kms@xmath2 and @xmath156kms@xmath2 , indicate a trend of a larger negative signal for larger cluster masses , corresponding to what one would expect from the model .",
    "we may think of this as a result of the cluster finding algorithm being more efficient in the task of identifying real clusters and their corresponding bcg for halo masses above @xmath157 , or the noise introduced by substructure and cluster mergers being less important for massive , relaxed clusters . in any case",
    ", it is clear that the positive values obtained in the radial global measurement of @xmath132 are explained by the fact that the clusters in the whl12 catalogue residing in this less massive region dominates over the more massive and `` reliable '' ones , for the mass distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : clusters_mass_distribution ] indicates . the difference between gmbcg and whl12 measurements may reside precisely in the fact that , as gmbcg algorithm is optimized to identify red sequence clusters and whl12 relies only on galaxy fof counting for their detection .",
    "the former method may contain a higher percentage of concentrated clusters , with a higher degree of virialization resulting in concordance between the measurement of internal redshift effects and the model for which virialization assumed .      in the redmapper catalog",
    ", we also restrict the sample to those clusters in the @xmath134 redshift range and with 6 or more galaxies with spectroscopic redshift measurements , reducing the number of useful clusters from 10,197 to only 3,372 , these having a mean richness of 35 ( corresponding to @xmath158 , the double than in the two previously considered catalogues ) , and a mean redshift of @xmath159 .",
    "the velocity distribution with the corresponding fits and the resulting values of @xmath132 obtained from them are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : velocity_ditribution ]  and  [ fig : grav_shift_radial ] respectively .",
    "although the amplitude of the signal is expected to be higher for this cluster sample , apart from the second radial bin centered at @xmath160mpc , with @xmath161kms@xmath2 , all the other radial measurements of @xmath132 do not deviate more than @xmath162kms@xmath2 from the measurements obtained using the gmbcg catalogue .",
    "even when all the @xmath132 measured points remain negative , there is no clear evidence for a stronger internal redshift signal compared to the one provided by gmbcg catalogue .",
    "now , as the number of clusters is relatively small , we measure the integrated signal of @xmath132 up to 7@xmath140 for only two mass subsamples of clusters . in this case",
    ", we use , as in the gmbcg case , the @xmath140 estimates obtained assuming a nfw density profile for the clusters considered .",
    "the resulting measurements for the two mass bins , @xmath163kms@xmath2 and @xmath164kms@xmath2 at @xmath165 and @xmath166 , respectively , are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : grav_shift_stacked ] .",
    "this comparison shows that the measured @xmath132 appears to be more negative for the high - mass sample than for the low - mass one at 1.8@xmath167 significance .",
    "it is also reassuring that these measurements closely follow the model prediction .",
    "in this section we describe the measurement of the redshift enhancement of background galaxies behind the sdss clusters due to lens magnification .",
    "this may help elucidate further the results we have found above for the gravitational redshift .",
    "we are interested to see to what extent the three cluster samples provide a consistent level of projected mass as determined by a completely independent mass estimate generated by the effect of gravitational lensing .",
    "lens magnification is caused in this case by a foreground cluster , which acts as a gravitational lens with the lensing shear @xmath168 and convergence @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is the projected mass density of the lens in units of the critical surface density for lensing : @xmath171 with @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 referring to observer - source , observer - lens and source - lens angular - diameter distances , respectively .",
    "the magnification caused by the lens is given by : @xmath175 which distorts the background region in two ways : i ) as gravitational lensing preserves surface brightness , the flux from a source is amplified as the lens increases the solid angle under which such source appears .",
    "this implies that the luminosity limit of a survey is increased by a factor @xmath176 in the lens region , resulting in a higher surface density of observed background objects due to the ones which could not had been seen otherwise .",
    "ii ) the sky area behind the foreground lens is expanded , so that the surface density of objects decreases as the effective cross - section behind the clusters becomes smaller .",
    "the combination of this two effects and the resulting difference on the number of lensed sourced detected is known as _ magnification bias _ @xcite .",
    "thus , if the observed apparent luminosity of a lensed source is given by @xmath177 , the observed number of objects with luminosities bigger than @xmath178 is given by : @xmath179=\\frac{1}{\\mu}\\,n_\\mathrm{0}[>l_{\\mathrm{lim}}(z)/\\mu]\\,,\\ ] ] where the @xmath180 factor comes from the dilation of the sky solid angle .",
    "hence , in the case where @xmath181\\propto l(z)^{-\\beta}$ ] , the previous equation simplifies to : @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the logarithmic slope of the luminosity function @xmath184 evaluated at @xmath86 : @xmath185 taking into account that the number density of objects @xmath186 depends on redshift , the average redshift of the background lensed sources is given by : @xmath187 which , if @xmath188 is greater than unity , is higher than the average redshift in the absence of gravitational lenses .      in order to model the expected redshift enhancement signal produced by an ensemble of clusters , we first calculate the effect of magnification on the unlensed redshift distribution @xmath189 of background sources using eq .",
    "( [ eq : lensedvsunlensed ] ) . to compute the magnification @xmath190 as a function of mass and distance from the cluster center , as done throughout the paper ( sec .",
    "[ sect : data ] ) , we adopt the nfw density profile with the concentration - mass relations provided by @xcite , which are favored by recent cluster lensing observations @xcite .",
    "we employ the projected nfw functionals given by @xcite , which provide a good description of the projected total matter distribution of cluster - sized haloes out to approximately twice the virial radius , beyond which the two - halo term can not be ignored @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , however , this projected nfw model is sufficient to describe the data with the current sensitivity .",
    "as for the luminosity function @xmath184 of the source galaxies , from which we compute the logarithmic slope @xmath183 ( eq .  ( [ eq : betafunction ] ) ) , we follow cbu13 and use the schechter parametrization of the @xmath191-band luminosity function given by @xcite , obtained using vimos vlt deep survey @xcite data , and adopt the redshift evolution from @xcite : @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "the advantage of using this particular survey , although its small 1deg@xmath17 survey area , resides in that it is much deeper ( @xmath194 , @xmath195 ) than the background galaxy sample we are using ( @xmath196 ) , so that the logarithmic slope of the luminosity function as a function of redshift is very well described in the range of redshift and magnitude we are interested in .    finally , the limiting luminosity used to evaluate @xmath197 , is given by : @xmath198 with @xmath199 the limiting magnitude of the boss survey , and @xmath200 the @xmath201-correction : @xmath202 where the second term can be neglected as the @xmath191-band rest - frame flux falls in the @xmath21-band at @xmath4 .",

    "compared to cbu13 , here we use over a factor of two increase in the number of background galaxies ( 855,097 in total ) , however we restrict our analysis to those clusters with a bcg spectroscopic redshift to ease the comparison with the gravitational redshift measurements .",

    "we have then measured the internal redshift distortion @xmath98 associated to each cluster sample as a function of cluster radius .",

    "if all our clusters were relaxed , had no sub - structure , and the number of spectroscopic measurements were proportional to the density of galaxies , each cluster would practically follow the stacked cluster distribution of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_spaces ] .",

    "even if bcg finder algorithms were perfect ( in the sense of identifying the brightest most massive galaxy of each cluster ) , it has been shown by @xcite that the implicit assumption that bcgs reside at the potential minimum is subject to an significant inherent variance leading to a biased measurement of the galaxy velocity dispersion arising from a difference between the measured position of the bcg and the real position of the cluster halo center @xcite .",
    "the underlying offset distribution between the dark matter projected center and the bcgs has been also studied by @xcite and @xcite , being shown in the latter that the magnification signal is qualitatively less sensitive to the miscentering effect compared to the shear signal . in principle , stacking all the velocity distributions of galaxies around bcgs into an effective distribution accounts for some of the previously mentioned effects , and enables us to measure any statistical deviation @xmath132 from @xmath229 .",

    "we have also measured the level of magnification bias in each cluster survey , using the latest dr10 boss 850,000 galaxy spectra , almost tripling the number of galaxies used in the first measurement of this effect by cbu13 .",
    "we detect a clear radial redshift enhancement of the background galaxies behind clusters in all three surveys with a significance of @xmath217 , @xmath218 and @xmath219 levels for gmbcg , whl12 and redmapper cluster catalogues respectively .",
    "making use of the previously employed richness - mass relations , we have also measured the integrated signal out to @xmath237mpc for different subsamples of clusters with different average masses . after modeling this gravitational lensing feature using projected nfw functionals for the clusters and luminosity functions based on deep spectroscopic surveys ,",
    "we find a generally good agreement between theoretical predictions and observations for the three cluster catalogues , with a clear increase of the mean redshift of background sources at smaller decreasing projected clustocentric radius from the bcg , and also an increasing redshift enhancement with increasing cluster masses .",
    "the whl12 catalogue follows less well the model for the low and the high mass bins falling below the expected value , with discrepancies of @xmath238 and @xmath239 , respectively .      from a comparison of our internal redshift distortion and",
    "lensing redshift enhancement measurements for three major cluster samples defined from the sdss survey , we conclude that the whl12 catalog , containing the largest number of clusters , is anomalous in the sense that the net internal redshift effect is found to be uniformly positive with radius at a level of @xmath226kms@xmath2 instead of negative with @xmath240kms@xmath2 , as expected given the claimed richnesses of these clusters .",
    "examining the mass dependence of these results we find it is the clusters with @xmath241 that introduce the unexpected positive signal , as more massive clusters produce a net redshift of @xmath240kms@xmath2 , similar to gmbcg and redmapper samples .",
    "given the much higher number of clusters claimed for the whl12 sample compared to the other two catalogues , it could be that this positive signal arises from spurious detection of clusters or from chance projection of less massive systems .",
    "the internal redshift and lensing magnification signals have totally different sensitivities to line - of - sight projection effects .",
    "it is very likely that a higher degree of contamination due to projection effects in this catalogue is responsible for the observed trends in both measurements , as lensing measures the sum of the projected signal . for the redmapper cluster catalogue , which has the smallest sample size due to its conservative minimum richness cutoff",
    ", both measurements are shown to agree well with respective predictions albeit the large statistical uncertainties .",
    "it also exhibits the best performance in terms of the accuracy of cluster mass estimates because the mass dependence of the signal predicted by models is detected at the @xmath242 level .",

    "our analysis shows that internal redshift measurements are not simply limited by the statistical precision , namely the number of clusters used , but are also sensitive to systematic effects that are not fully understood . in future work",
    ", we intend to study these systematics in more detail utilizing phase space information to better account for the inherent velocity dispersion of bcgs with respect to the mean cluster velocity and other possible sources of systematics , such as the effects of cluster miscentering , kinematic behavior of satellite galaxies in relaxed and unrelaxed clusters , and substructures .",
