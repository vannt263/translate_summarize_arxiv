    "<S> layered transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmdcs ) have attracted extensive interests for applications in electronics , optoelectronics and valleytronics due to the strong spin - orbit coupling , sizable band gap and tunability of the electronic structure by quantum confinement effect . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in the past decade , this has been witnessed by the significant efforts conducted on the atomically thin mos@xmath0 film . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , its low mobility has limited applications , for inbstance , in high speed electronics . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite finding thin films of other tmdc with better properties is highly desirable . </S>",
    "<S> ptse@xmath0 has emerged as an interesting compound that belongs to tmdc . </S>",
    "<S> although the bulk crystal is a semimetal , @xcite monolayer ( ml ) platinum diselenide ( ptse@xmath0 ) has been revealed to be a semiconductor with a band gap of @xmath1 1.2 ev . @xcite importantly , the charge - carrier mobility of ptse@xmath0 has been predicted among the highest in tmdcs @xcite and has been experimentally shown to be comparable to black phosphorene @xcite yet with the advantage of much improved stability . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this makes ptse@xmath0 a promising candidate for high - speed electronics . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the hidden helical spin texture with spin - layer locking in monolayer ptse@xmath0 has been recently revealed , @xcite and such spin physics induced by a local rashba effect has great potential for electric field tunable spintronic devices . </S>",

    "<S> monolayer ptse@xmath0 film has been first grown by direct selenization of pt(111 ) substrate,@xcite which is convenient to yield large films up to millimeter size . however </S>",
    "<S> , growing such film on metallic pt substrates hinders the electronics application which instead requires an insulating substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the direct selenization method results in a self - terminating monolayer thin film , while thicker films can not be grown using this method . </S>",
    "<S> although atomically thin ptse@xmath0 flakes with different thickness can mechanically exfoliated from the bulk crystals , @xcite the sample size is still unsatisfactory and unscalable . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite are reported , however , the polycrystalline nature and lack of atomic - level thickness control are yet to be improved . on the other hand , molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) can provide a better control in terms of growth dynamics and realization of large size , high quality single crystalline films on various substrates with controlled film thickness , @xcite thus providing important material basis for investigating the physical properties and potential applications . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we report the first layer - by - layer growth of high quality epitaxial ptse@xmath0 thin films on bilayer graphene/6h - sic ( 0001 ) substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the growth process is monitored by reflection high - energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) and low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) . </S>",
    "<S> the high sample quality is revealed by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we present a systematic study of the vibrational modes and core levels as a function of film thickness by raman spectroscopy and x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the band structure measured by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) from 1 ml to 22 ml ptse@xmath0 thin films shows the shrinking of band gap as the film thickness increases . </S>",

    "<S> p__@xmath2__m__1 space group ( no .  162 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the building block of ptse@xmath0 contains one pt atomic layer sandwiched between two se layers , where pt atoms are octahedrally coordinated by the se atoms ( figure 1a ) . </S>",
    "<S> atomically thin ptse@xmath0 films with varying thickness from 1 ml to 22 ml were grown on bilayer graphene/6h - sic ( 0001 ) substrates using a home built mbe system with a base pressure of 2@xmath310@xmath4 torr . </S>",

    "<S> the surface morphology of the substrate is revealed by afm image ( figure 1d ) , with an average terrace of @xmath1 200 nm and a step height of @xmath1 0.75 nm ( figure 1f ) which is the typical height of triple sic bilayer steps.@xcite the overall substrate steps are preserved after growth of the ptse@xmath0 film ( figure 1e ) , indicating the uniform epitaxy growth along the graphene steps . compared with samples prepared by cvd or tac , our mbe films have significantly improved crystallinity , homogeneity and continuity in large scale as well as better thickness control at atomic level . </S>",
    "<S> such high quality single crystalline films provide a unique opportunity for a systematic study of the evolution of the vibrational and electronic properties as a function of sample thickness .     </S>",

    "<S> the high quality films result in sharper spectra than exfoliated flakes @xcite and three peaks are clearly identified as e@xmath7 , a@xmath8 and lo . in all ptse@xmath0 films , two prominent peaks at @xmath5180 @xmath9 and @xmath5208.5 @xmath9 , correspond to the e@xmath10 and a@xmath8 raman active modes respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the e@xmath10 mode corresponds to an intra - layer in - plane vibration of se atoms moving in opposite directions and the a@xmath8 mode involves the out - of - plane vibration of se atoms moving away from each other . </S>",
    "<S> the e@xmath10 mode shows a clear blue shift with decreasing film thickness ( figure 2b ) , while the a@xmath8 mode is pinned at 208.5 @xmath9 at the first few layers thin film . </S>",
    "<S> a red shift of a@xmath8 peak is also observed in thicker ( 22 ml ) ptse@xmath0 film , which is less significant compared with e@xmath10 mode . </S>",
    "<S> this anomalous behavior may be attributed to stacking - induced structural changes and long - range coulombic interlayer interactions . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite moreover , the peak intensity of the a@xmath8 mode relative to that of the e@xmath10 mode is strongly pronounced from 1 ml to 22 ml ( figure 2c ) , consistent with the enhanced van der waals interactions in thicker films . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the peak at @xmath5240 @xmath9 is attributed to a longitudinal optical ( lo ) mode , which is a combination of the out - of - plane ( a@xmath11 ) and in - plane ( e@xmath12 ) vibrations of platinum and selenium atoms respectively , with a similiar origin to those observed in hfs@xmath13 , zrs@xmath13 and cdi@xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the zoom - in spectra in figure 2d show the strongest lo mode in 1 ml ptse@xmath0 film that splits into two peaks at @xmath5236 @xmath9 and @xmath5239 @xmath9 . with increasing thickness , such two peaks merge into a broader and weaker peak . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2e - f shows the xps spectra of pt and se . </S>",
    "<S> a blue shift of se 3d and pt 4f core levels by @xmath1 240 mev ( figure s2 in the supplementary information ) suggests the different chemical environment in 1 ml film . </S>",
    "<S> the shift of the core level to higher binding energies suggests that there is likely charge transfer between the substrate and the first ptse@xmath0 layer .    to reveal the evolution of the electronic structure as a function of film thickness </S>",
    "<S> , we show in figure 3 leed and arpes data taken from 1 ml film to 22 ml ptse@xmath0 films . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3a - e shows leed patterns with different film thickness . in 1 ml film ( figure 3a ) , </S>",
    "<S> both the signals from the ptse@xmath0 film ( indicated by white arrows ) and the substrate ( grey arrow ) are observed . </S>",
    "<S> ptse@xmath0 grows mainly along the orientation of the graphene substrate with some small azimuthal deviations due to the weak coupling between ptse@xmath0 and graphene , showing an arc - like feature in leed signal . as the growth proceeds ( figure 3b - e ) , the substrate </S>",
    "<S> is completely covered by ptse@xmath0 and the leed pattern from graphene disappears . </S>",
    "<S> arpes dispersions measured along the @xmath14-k high symmetry direction are shown in figure 3f - j . </S>",
    "<S> our data of 1 ml ptse@xmath0 film ( figure 3f ) matches well with previous work on 1 ml ptse@xmath0 film grown by direct selenization method , @xcite showing a semiconductor with the top of the valence bands at -1.2 ev . for films thicker than 1 ml , an additional band with an m - shape ( indicated by gray arrow in figure 3 g ) emerges . </S>",
    "<S> this band moves toward the fermi energy , indicating a reduction of the band gap as predicted . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the m - shape valence band eventually develops into a three dimensional dirac cone in the bulk topological dirac semimetal . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by increasing the film thickness , the 22 ml ptse@xmath0 film shows effectively the same electronic band structure as the bulk dirac semimetal except a 350 mev charge transfer from the substrate ( figure s3 in the supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> the arpes experiments thus provide a direct evidence for the tunable bandgap with varying film thickness .     </S>",
    "<S> [ figure 3 ]     [ figure 4 ]    we further perform spin - arpes measurements to reveal the spin texture of ptse@xmath0 films . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4a - d shows spin - arpes measurements along the @xmath14-k and @xmath14-k@xmath15 high symmetry directions of both 1 ml and 2 ml films . </S>",
    "<S> large spin contrast is observed along the tangential direction ( @xmath16 ) at emission angles of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively ( dahsed line in figure 4f ) . the radial ( _ * r * _ ) and out - of - plane ( @xmath19 ) directions show negligible spin contrast ( figure s4 in the supplementary information ) </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the helical spin texture as previously reported in 1 ml ptse@xmath0 films on pt(111 ) substrate , @xcite confirming that it is an intrinsic effect of the ptse@xmath0 film . </S>",
    "<S> similar helical spin texture is also observed in centrosymmetric bulk ptse@xmath0 crystals ( figure 4e ) , supporting the spin - layer locking mechanism induced by local rashba effect @xcite . such helical spin texture induced by local rashba effect </S>",
    "<S> makes it useful for electric field tunable spintronics .    to summarize , </S>",
    "<S> we have successfully achieved layer - by - layer growth of high quality ptse@xmath0 thin films with controlled thickness using mbe . </S>",
    "<S> the samples are characterized by raman , xps , leed and the electronic structure is revealed by apres . </S>",
    "<S> arpes measurements reveal a distinct tunable bandgap in atomically thin films . </S>",
    "<S> the mbe growth can also be extended to insulating substrates . </S>",
    "<S> combined with its unique high charge - carrier mobility and air stability , ptse@xmath0 is a promising candidate for practical applications as new generation electronic devices . </S>",
