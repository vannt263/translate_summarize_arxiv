    "have been identified in a variety of surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "there are several examples of white dwarfs with strong ( @xmath2 mg ) magnetic fields that display starspots , but a strong magnetic field is not always required or observed @xcite .",
    "re j0317 - 853 belongs to the former category , where a @xmath3 340 - 450 mg field is detected along with 0.2 mag peak - to - peak photometric variations due to a starspot that comes into view every 725 s due to the rotation of the white dwarf @xcite .",

    "in addition to boks 53856 , a magnetic white dwarf that displays 4.9% amplitude variations every 6.1 h @xcite , @xcite find low - amplitude ( 60 - 2000 ppm ) variations in half of the 14 white dwarfs observed as part of the original kepler mission .",
    "this is unprecedented , as it implies that a large fraction of white dwarfs do indeed vary on hour - to - day timescales .",
    "the k2 mission has already discovered a disintegrating planet and a double white dwarf system in the first field @xcite , and a significant fraction of the k2 white dwarfs do also show low - amplitude variations ( n. hallakoun 2015 , private communication ) .",

    "section 4 visits three potential explanations for the observed photometric dips and demonstrates that a dark spot is the most likely source .",
    "we discuss the potential implications of this discovery on the k2 mission and the lsst , and conclude in section 5 .",

    "@xcite classify it as a potentially magnetic dah white dwarf based on this spectrum .",
    "however , there is no evidence of zeeman splitting of the balmer lines in our higher quality gemini data ( see below ) . using the 1d atmosphere models for non - magnetic da white dwarfs and the fitting procedures outlined in @xcite , we find @xmath5 k and @xmath6 based on the sdss data . these place j1529 + 2928 near the empirical boundaries of the zz ceti instability strip @xcite .",
    "j1529 + 2928 is slightly cooler than the massive pulsating white dwarf bpm 37093 , which has @xmath7 k , @xmath8 , and pulsation periods between 512 and 635 s @xcite .",
    "we acquired high speed photometry of j1529 + 2928 using the apache point observatory 3.5 m telescope with the agile frame - transfer camera .",
    "we obtained 45 s long exposures with the bg40 filter over 1.7 h on ut 2015 april 10 .",
    "we also obtained extensive follow - up photometry using the mcdonald 2.1 m telescope and the proem frame - transfer camera .",

    "we used the 8 m gemini north telescope with the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) to obtain medium resolution spectroscopy of j1529 + 2928 on 2015 july 7 and 10 as part of the program gn-2015a - dd-8 .",
    "we obtained a sequence of 26@xmath11180 s exposures with the r831 grating and a 0.5@xmath12 slit , providing wavelength coverage from 5500   to 7600   and a resolving power of 4396 .",

    "figure [ fig : lc ] shows the bg40-filter light curve of j1529 + 2928 obtained over 3 different nights at the mcdonald observatory 2.1 m telescope .",
    "there are only two significant peaks in the fourier transform ; the main peak is at 37.74917(9 ) cycles d@xmath13 , 2288.792(6 ) s or 38.1 min , with a 2.95(4)% amplitude , and its first harmonic is detected at 75.49834(21 ) cycles d@xmath13 .",
    "the light curve shows a strong dip in light that lasts about half the phase , a feature that looks like an eclipse . there is no evidence of any change in the ` eclipse ' times over the 66 day baseline of these observations .    our apo data with the bg40 filter span only 1.7",
    "h , but the frequency and amplitude of the variations are consistent with the mcdonald data within the errors .",
    "we detect 3.19(7)% photometric variations with a period of 2250(10 ) s. similarly , we detect variations with periods of 2289(1 ) s and 2288(13 ) s in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 data , respectively . since the bg40 filter data from the mcdonald 2.1 m telescope have the highest signal - to - noise ratio and the longest baseline , we adopt the best - fit period of 2288.792(6 ) s for j1529 + 2928 for the remainder of the paper .",

    "it is clear from this figure ( especially given the narrow h@xmath16 core ) that there is no evidence of significant velocity variations in any of the balmer lines . forcing a fit at the photometric period of 2288.792 s yields a velocity semi - amplitude of @xmath17 km s@xmath13 .",

    "these correspond to @xmath25 , @xmath26 mag , @xmath27 pc , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and an age of 1.3 gyr .",
    "given the photometric period and the lack of significant velocity variations , the mass function is @xmath30 . if the eclipses are due to a stellar or brown dwarf companion , the inclination would have to be almost @xmath31 . for an edge - on orbit",
    ", the companion would be 0.007 @xmath32 , or 7 @xmath33 at a separation of 0.38 @xmath34 .",
    "hence , our radial velocity measurements rule out all stellar and brown dwarf companions around j1529 + 2928 .",
    "in addition , all solid - body planetary objects are also ruled out as they would lead to very short transit durations of @xmath35 min .",
    "j1529 + 2928 has a systemic velocity of @xmath36 km s@xmath13 as measured from the sdss spectrum .",
    "the expected gravitational redshift is 81.8 km s@xmath13 .",
    "hence , the true systemic velocity of j1529 + 2928 should be @xmath37 km s@xmath13 .",
    "our 1d atmospheric parameters for j1529 + 2928 are within 1@xmath38 of the atmospheric parameters for the massive pulsating zz ceti bpm 37093 ( see  2.1 and fig . [",
    "fig : fit ] ) .",
    "however , the photometric dips seen in j1529 + 2928 can not be due to pulsations .",
    "all known davs have pulsation periods of @xmath39 1200 s ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "bpm 37093 and gd 518 , the two pulsators with @xmath40 , have pulsation periods of 512 - 635 s and 425 - 595 s , respectively @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the buoyancy cutoff period for typical - mass wds is @xmath411000 s , and almost certainly @xmath42 s @xcite .",
    "hence , the 38 min period variability in j1529 + 2928 is not due to pulsations .     and h@xmath15 are slightly filled in due to the flux contribution from a relatively cool starspot.,width=384 ]      the roche limit for earth density objects around j1529 + 2928 is @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "hence , a putative 38 min period orbiting planet would be tidally disrupted .",
    "such a planet would be falling apart after hundreds of orbits , yet figure [ fig : lc ] clearly demonstrates that the photometric dips are constant over several weeks / months and that the hypothetical object is not appreciably changing .",
    "this implies that the ` eclipses ' are not from a transiting object , but rather from a surface feature on the white dwarf itself .    unlike the candidate disintegrating planet around wd 1145 + 017 @xcite",
    ", there is no evidence of a debris disk around j1529 + 2928 based on the 3.6 @xmath44 m photometry from the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) mission .",
    "in addition , a relatively cool eclipsing planetary companion would lead to increasing eclipse depth as a function of wavelength .",
    "this is not seen in our photometric observations .",
    "hence , the source of the photometric dips in j1529 + 2928 is not a disintegrating planet .",
    "figure [ fig : color ] shows the phased and binned bg40 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 light curves of j1529 + 2928 . here",
    "we used the best - fit period from the bg40 data , 2288.792 s , to phase the data in the other filters .",
    "the semi - amplitude of the photometric dips change from @xmath45% in the bg40 filter , to @xmath46% and @xmath47% in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 filter data , respectively .",
    "the @xmath10 data are relatively noisy and do not provide strong constraints on this system . however , the dips in the @xmath9 filter are significantly shallower than those in the bg40 filter .",
    "this clearly rules out a cool substellar companion around j1529 + 2928 , and instead favors a starspot on the surface of the white dwarf . the spots on boks 53856 and wd 2359 - 434 were stable over several months @xcite , though the latter shows a slight decrease in amplitude over two years ( b. gary 2015 , private communication ) .",
    "hence , starspots can explain the stability of the photometric dips in our data spanning four months .",
    "figure [ fig : color ] also shows the extreme ultraviolet explorer ( euve ) data on gd 394 from @xcite .",
    "the similarities between the gd 394 and j1529 + 2928 light curves are stunning .",
    "gd 394 is a relatively hot white dwarf with @xmath48 k and @xmath49 .",
    "the optical and ultraviolet spectra show strong si features as well as a variety of trace elements including c , n , o , al , and fe .",
    "the si abundance by number is ( si / h ) @xmath50 .",
    "@xcite suggest that the 1.15 d period variability seen in the euve light curve of gd 394 is due to inhomogeneous abundance distribution of metals over the surface of the star . in their model ,",
    "an almost circular spot with a higher heavy element abundance reduces the euv emission over the spot region , causing 25% dips in brightness .",
    "we do not have strong constraints on the metal abundances in j1529 + 2928 given the lack of high - resolution optical spectroscopy or ultraviolet data .",
    "however , there is a weak ca k line in our gmos spectrum at the same velocity as the balmer lines .",
    "we measure an abundance of @xmath51 from this line , but the spectrum is relatively noisy in this wavelength range and we take this measurement as an upper limit on the ca abundance .",
    "hence , metals are likely present in the atmosphere of j1529 + 2928 and are the likely cause of the periodic dips seen in its light curve .",
    "since the opacity due to metals essentially decreases with increasing wavelength , a dark spot with a higher heavy element abundance would naturally explain the decrease in ` eclipse ' depth in the bg40 and @xmath52band data .    both the sdss and gemini spectra ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fit ] ) show that the observed line profiles are shallower than predicted by the best - fit model .",
    "the same is also true for the h@xmath16 line profiles .",
    "assuming an inclination of @xmath31 , a 10,000 k spot that covers 14% of the surface area of the white dwarf would explain the observed dips in both bg40 and @xmath9 filters . due to the slight temperature difference between the spot and the white dwarf , such a spot also helps explain the observed h@xmath15 and h@xmath16 line profiles .",
    "however , there are significant degeneracies in modelling of starspots due to unknown inclination , number of spots , spot latitude , and temperature @xcite , and further observations will be necessary to constrain the temperature of the spot region more accurately .",
    "it is difficult to explain the presence of a spot on a white dwarf without invoking a magnetic field . @xcite",
    "constrain the magnetic field in gd 394 to @xmath53 kg and they argue that such low field strengths may be enough to channel the accreted metals onto a spot if the accretion rate is low .",
    "based on the lack of detection of zeeman splitting of the narrow h@xmath16 core , we derive an upper limit of @xmath0 kg .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite demonstrate that spotlike magnetic field enhancements extend to low field stars .",
    "they find a surface - wide 70 kg field and a localized 500 kg field to explain the 1.44 d period 2% peak - to - peak amplitude variations seen in wd 1953 - 011 .",
    "hence , a similar field structure could potentially explain the presence of spots on gd 394 and j1529 + 2928 .",
    "gd 394 and j1529 + 2928 present excellent examples of apparently non - magnetic and isolated white dwarfs with spots .",
    "both stars show significant dips in their light curves on hour - to - day timescales that are relatively easy to detect .",
    "the discovery of low - level ( up to 0.2% ) hour - to - day timescale variations in the kepler data on apparently non - magnetic and isolated white dwarfs by @xcite is therefore quite interesting .",
    "@xcite present several scenarios to explain their observations , including but not limited to magnetic spots , hot spots from an interstellar medium accretion flow , transits by small planetary companions , or the reflection effect on a brown dwarf or giant planet companion .    based on the detection of hour / day timescale photometric variations in strongly magnetic ( e.g. , re j0317 - 853 ) , weakly magnetic ( e.g. , wd 2359 - 434 ) , and apparently non - magnetic ( e.g. , gd 394 and j1529 + 2928 ) white dwarfs",
    ", we suggest that many of the variable white dwarfs in the kepler and k2 mission likely have starspots due to surface inhomogenities and that the observed variability is a direct indicator of the rotation periods of these white dwarfs .",
    "the k2 mission will observe several hundred white dwarfs , and even with its decreased sensitivity compared to the original kepler mission , it should still be able to find a relatively large number of variable white dwarfs and measure their rotation rates .",
    "the lsst will image 13 million white dwarfs down to @xmath54 mag and the design goals include photometric repeatability of 5 mma at the bright end .",
    "the photometric precision of each visit will be worse at fainter magnitudes , e.g. 1% at @xmath55 mag and 2% at @xmath56 mag @xcite .",
    "only one of the 15 white dwarfs ( 6.7% ) observed by the kepler mission , boks 53856 , displays photometric variations larger than a few per cent .",
    "eleven out of the 74 ( 15% ) white dwarfs within 20 pc of the sun are magnetic with @xmath57 100 kg @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite find 1 - 2% variability in 2/3 of their @xmath58 kg magnetic white dwarf sample , implying an overall variability fraction of 10% .",
    "@xcite find the fraction of magnetic white dwarfs in the 25 pc local sample to be @xmath59% , but @xcite demonstrate that the fraction could be substantially higher than 10% for @xmath60 kg .",
    "hence , with a 1% precision at @xmath55 mag , the lsst may find @xmath61 white dwarfs that show variations on hour / day timescales due to the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "we present the discovery of 38 min period eclipse - like events in the light curve of the massive white dwarf j1529 + 2928 .",
    "we rule out stellar and brown dwarf companions based on the lack of significant radial velocity variations , and demonstrate that the dips in the light curve are likely caused by a dark spot that comes into view every 38 min due to the rotation of the white dwarf .",
    "the presence of a spot on j1529 + 2928 almost certainly requires a magnetic field . however , there is no evidence of zeeman splitting of the balmer lines in our optical spectroscopy , constraining the magnetic field strength to @xmath0 kg .",
    "follow - up high resolution optical spectroscopy or spectropolarimetry would be useful to search for a magnetic field and constrain its strength .",
    "a weak ca k line is present in our spectrum , though follow - up uv spectroscopy would be useful to confirm the presence of metals and constrain their abundances in j1529 + 2928 .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that accreted metals concentrated on a spot by a magnetic field would lead to an enhanced opacity source when the spot is in view , and this could explain the observed euv light curve of gd 394 .",
    "the same model would also explain the differing ` eclipse ' depths in j1529 + 2928 in different filters .",
    "@xcite predict that the uv and optical light curves should be in antiphase due to the flux redistribution effect .",
    "follow - up concurrent uv and optical photometry observations can test this hypothesis .",
    "finally , based on the discovery of significant photometric variations in apparently non - magnetic white dwarfs like gd 394 and j1529 + 2928 , we discuss the high incidence of photometric variability observed in the kepler and k2 missions .",
    "we argue that the source of the variability is most likely related to the presence of weak magnetic fields , and that current and future transient surveys like the lsst should find a significant number of white dwarfs that display hour - to - day timescale photometric variations .",
