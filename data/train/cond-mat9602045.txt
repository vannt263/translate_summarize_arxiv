    "the field of non - equilibrium growth processes has attracted quite a lot of interest in the recent past  @xcite .",

    "the dynamics of this surface is given by the kardar ",
    "parisi  zhang  @xcite ( kpz ) equation @xmath6 with a gaussian white noise defined by @xmath7 the surface described by  ( [ kpz ] ) can be in different phases which depend on the dimension - less coupling constant @xmath8 and the space dimension @xmath0 . in less than two dimensions",
    "there are two different phases : the weak coupling phase for @xmath9 and the strong coupling phase for @xmath10 . above two dimensions ,",
    "there exists a critical value @xmath11 .",
    "the surface is in the weak coupling phase for @xmath12 and in the strong coupling phase for @xmath13 . precisely at @xmath14",
    "the system undergoes a roughening transition . whereas the linear growth equation for @xmath9 can easily be solved in any dimension , it is much more difficult to get information on the critical behavior of the other phases .",
    "the morphology of the surface in the different phases is characterized by the asymptotic scaling of the height - correlation - function @xmath15 and the dynamic exponent @xmath16 . for @xmath10",
    "these exponents satisfy the hyperscaling relation @xmath17  @xcite .    in the strong coupling phase",
    "it is known that @xmath18 in @xmath19  @xcite and @xmath20 in the limit of infinite dimension  @xcite . in general dimensions",
    "all exact methods fail and only numerical and mode  coupling results are available , but they become less reliable in higher dimensions .",
    "therefore there is still a very controversial discussion @xcite about the existence of a finite upper critical dimension of the kpz problem , i.e. a dimension above which the dynamical exponent @xmath16 has the constant value @xmath21 .    in the language of the renormalization group ,",
    "the different phases belong to different fixed points . for less than two dimensions ,",
    "there is one unstable fixed point at @xmath9 , which governs the weak coupling phase , and one stable fixed point at @xmath22 , which governs the strong coupling phase . above two dimensions ,",
    "the weak coupling fixed point also becomes stable and a new fixed point describing the roughening transition appears in between the other fixed points .    it has been shown  @xcite that the strong  coupling fixed point is inaccessible by a perturbation expansion around @xmath9 .",
    "the situation is somewhat better for the fixed point describing the roughening transition .",
    "the singularities , which arise in the perturbation series above two dimensions , can be treated in a systematic expansion  @xcite with parameter @xmath23 in the framework of this @xmath24-expansion , one finds the exponents @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which are exact to all orders in perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "hence , hyperscaling is preserved .    however , this perturbation expansion breaks down for @xmath1 since new singularities in the coefficients of the series expansions arise at @xmath27 , where @xmath28 the treatment of these singularities is the aim of this paper .",
    "we develop a systematic way to extract the behavior of physical quantities as @xmath1 from the divergent series in @xmath29 .",
    "we show that in contrast to the singularities in @xmath24 , these singularities translate into a non - analytic behavior of observable quantities .",
    "this stresses the importance of @xmath3 for the kpz problem and therefore shows that four dimensions is a good candidate for an upper critical dimension .",
    "we will address this question not in the kpz picture but by using the exact hopf  cole",
    " mapping  @xcite of the kpz problem to a directed polymer in a random medium . a directed polymer ( also called a string )",
    "is a line with a preferred direction , which is governed by its line tension .",
    "the energy of a given conformation is @xmath30=\\int_0^{l_{||}}\\frac12\\dot r^2(t ) + \\lambda\\nu^{-3/2}\\eta(r(t),t){\\rm d}t,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is a @xmath0-dimensional vector which denotes the elongation of the directed polymer at a position along the preferred ( `` time '' ) axis @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the projected length of the directed polymer and @xmath34 is the random potential which appears in the kpz equation .    to study the structure of the new singularities in the perturbation series , we will use an especially simple physical quantity .",
    "we nevertheless expect , that more complicated quantities such as correlation functions show the same type of singularities .",
    "we will study a system where the projected length @xmath33 of the directed polymer is infinite while its transversal `` motion '' is restricted to a finite volume of a characteristic width @xmath35 .",
    "within this system we will concentrate on the dimension - less averaged free energy per unit `` time '' , which we call @xmath36 the infrared regularization by the length scale @xmath37 has to be introduced , because the series expansion starts at the gaussian fixed point ( @xmath9 ) , which has no intrinsic length scale .",
    "@xmath37 moreover serves as the flow parameter of the renormalization group considered below .",
    "since at the roughening transition hyperscaling is preserved at least around @xmath21 dimensions  @xcite , therefore there are no corrections to the @xmath38 behavior of the free energy per length @xmath39 , and the finite size amplitude @xmath40 is a universal quantity . near @xmath41 ,",
    "one finds  @xcite for its value @xmath42 at the unbinding transition @xmath43    @xmath44 is not only one of the simplest physical quantities to be calculated in our system , but also one of the most fundamental ones : it plays a role very similar to the central charge in two - dimensional conformal models  @xcite .",
    "the directed polymer problem with randomness described by  ( [ randhamil ] ) can be treated analytically via the replica trick .",
    "this means that it can be expressed as the limiting case @xmath45 of @xmath46 directed polymers with a short - ranged interaction potential ( see e.g.  @xcite ) : @xmath47=\\int_0^{l_{|| } } \\frac12\\sum_{i=1}^n\\dot r_i^2(t)+ g\\sum_{i",

    "the finite size amplitude  ( [ randomc ] ) of the free energy per unit `` time '' of the random system can then be obtained from the limit @xmath45 of the finite size amplitudes per unit `` time '' and per pair of directed polymers @xmath49\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of the @xmath46-polymer system without randomness .",
    "the development of a new regularization scheme for the perturbation theory of @xmath44 near 4 dimensions is done in two steps . in the first step",
    ", the fact is used that for only two directed polymers independent techniques exist , that allow an exact solution of the 2polymer  problem .",
    "those methods ( the transfer matrix approach and the resummation of the perturbation series ) are reviewed and extended to our system with a transversally restricted `` movement '' in section  [ twopol ] of this paper    in order to be able to get results about perturbation series where no exact solution exists any more , a regularization scheme is developed by comparison with the exact solution .",
    "the regularization scheme itself then is independent of the existence of the exact solution in the sense that it extracts the results directly from the coefficients of the new singularities in the perturbation series .",
    "it is shown that only the most divergent terms in every order of perturbation theory contribute to the first order terms of the limiting @xmath50 function .",
    "as the second step this regularization scheme is then applied to the case of an arbitrary number of directed polymers in section  [ arbitn ] , which can only be solved exactly in one dimension  @xcite . a diagrammatic expansion of the partition function and of the free energy is developed .",
    "the series expansion is calculated up to the fifth order in the coupling constant and many simplifications appear , that suggest a simple underlying structure .",
    "since the most important diagrams with respect to the regularization scheme turn out to be just 2-polymer - diagrams , the main properties of the @xmath50 function can still be extracted from the general structure of the perturbation series .",
    "independent of the number of directed polymers in less then 4 dimensions there are two zeroes of the @xmath50 function : one is the finite size amplitude @xmath42 of the free energy per unit `` time '' at the unbinding transition ; the other one is at the gaussian fixed point . in 4 dimensions",
    "the @xmath50 function becomes just a straight line with a fixed slope .",
    "@xmath42 and the zero at the gaussian fixed point coincide there .",
    "we find that near 4 dimensions the physical quantity @xmath42 behaves non  analytically as @xmath51    since the behavior is independent of the number of directed polymers , it should also describe the scenario in the replica limit of a vanishing number of directed polymers and therefore the behavior of the weak - coupling fixed point of the kpz problem .    in section  [ conclusion ] ,",
    "the main results are summarized again .",
    "many of the technical details have been postponed to various appendices to keep the route of argumentation straight .",
    "since the problem of two directed polymers ( @xmath52 ) is especially simple , we start examining this problem and try to generalize our results in the next section .",
    "the reason for the simplicity of the two polymer problem is that one can separate the problem in the motion of a `` center of mass '' @xmath53 , which just fluctuates freely independent of the coupling constant @xmath54 and the problem in the relative coordinate @xmath55 . since the kpz ",
    "problem is equivalent to directed polymers with a relative short  range interaction ( @xmath56 ) , we have to deal in the relative coordinate with one directed polymer , which is interacting with a straight line defect at the origin of the perpendicular space . the transition probability from @xmath57 to @xmath58 within the projected contour length @xmath32 ( the restricted partition function ) is given by the single path integral @xmath59.\\ ] ]    the problem of",
    "one directed polymer interacting with a defect line can now be treated in different manners : on the one hand the path integral formulation of the directed polymer problem is equivalent to a `` quantum mechanics '' and can be solved in analogy to the corresponding quantum mechanical problem .",
    "this is called the transfer matrix approach because the hamiltonian of the quantum mechanics is the continuum transfer matrix of the problem .",
    "the second approach just sets up a perturbative expansion of the problem with the defect with the strength of the defect as the expansion parameter , which can either be calculated coefficient by coefficient or in the special case of two directed polymers can even be summed up completely .",
    "a comparison of these approaches shows that they lead to the same results .",
    "because we know the exact solutions , we can use them to develop a treatment of the perturbation series in the interesting case @xmath60 , which we afterwards can apply to problems where no exact solution is available any more , as for example the case of more than two directed polymers .",
    "since the path integral  ( [ zpathint ] ) is formally a quantum mechanical path integral in imaginary time , the partition function obeys the schroedinger equation @xmath61 of a particle in a potential @xmath62 , which can be attacked by standard quantum mechanical methods .",
    "if the movement is restricted to a finite volume characterized by some length @xmath63 , the long  time ( large projected length of the directed polymer ) behavior of the partition function is an exponential decay , the decay rate of which is given by the ground state energy of the quantum mechanical problem @xmath64 the free energy per unit `` time '' for long polymers is therefore given by the ground state energy plus exponentially small corrections .",
    "the finite size coefficient can be extracted by studying the behavior of the free energy for large system sizes @xmath65 . at the gaussian fixed point",
    "we expect from dimensional analysis that @xmath66 .",
    "the prefactor of this decay is @xmath67 . in order to calculate @xmath67 ,",
    "we extend here the calculations in  @xcite to the case of `` movement '' in a finite volume .      in order to solve the model in arbitrary dimensions",
    ", we have to use potentials and boundary conditions , which have a spherical symmetry . in this case , we can separate the wave function in a radial and an angular part . as it is well known from quantum mechanics ,",
    "it is convenient to define the radial function @xmath68 to be @xmath69 times the radial part of the total wave function .",
    "this function obeys for the lowest ( zero ) angular momentum - as it should be the case for the ground state - the radial schroedinger equation @xmath70    we implement the attractive potential at the origin as a well potential with a small but finite extension @xmath71 : @xmath72 by defining @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath71 can be eliminated and everything is written in dimension - less variables .",
    "the boundary conditions imposed to the directed polymer have to be radially symmetric , too .",
    "the two possibilities studied here in detail are on the one hand the dirichlet boundary conditions , where the directed polymer is put into a spherical box of radius @xmath65 with hard walls , which means @xmath77 , and on the other hand the von - neumann boundary conditions , which impose that the first derivative of the radial part of the wave function vanishes at the boundary of a spherical box of radius @xmath65 , in order to mimic a kind of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this is equivalent to the condition @xmath78 for the radial function @xmath79 .",
    "moreover we will consider harmonic boundary conditions .",
    "that means that we allow a `` movement '' in infinite space , but add an harmonic well potential @xmath80 , which effectively restricts the motion .",
    "the associated width of the box is from dimensional analysis @xmath81 .",
    "( the factor of @xmath82 has only been introduced for convenience ) .      for the potential",
    "as given by  [ radpot ] and the first two boundary conditions given in the above section , it is relatively easy , to calculate the ground state energy , because the potential is piecewise constant",
    ". only standard techniques of quantum mechanics are applied .",
    "a sketch of these calculations is given in appendix  [ appschroedsol ] .    here , we just give the results for the ground state energy .",
    "let us first consider the dirichlet boundary conditions .    for the free system ( @xmath83 ) the ground state energy is exactly given by @xmath84 with @xmath85 being the smallest positive root of the bessel function @xmath86 .",
    "this is also the asymptotic behavior for @xmath87 . at the phase transition point",
    "( @xmath88 ) we have @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the smallest positive root of @xmath91 .    for von - neumann boundary conditions the ground state energy is zero at @xmath83 . at @xmath87",
    "the asymptotic behavior is @xmath92 the decay is faster than quadratic which means that the coefficient we are looking for remains zero .",
    "this scaling behavior of the free energy per length in a system of finite transversal size at the unbinding transition is consistent with the scaling behavior of the eigenenergy of the bound state in the infinite system  @xcite .    at the phase transition",
    "we get @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the smallest positive root of @xmath95 .",
    "the decay for @xmath96 is again faster than quadratic .",
    "the differences between the decay coefficients at the phase transition point and in the free case ( which we defined to be @xmath42 in the introduction ) are plotted against the dimension in fig .",
    "[ trmurplot ] .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath42 stays finite as @xmath0 approaches 4 with dirichlet boundary conditions , whereas for von - neumann boundary conditions @xmath42 approaches zero . from the first three terms of the series expansion of the bessel function @xmath95 ( the third term is the first one with a non - vanishing coefficient in the limit @xmath97 ) we get near @xmath98 a behavior of @xmath99 , which yields equation  ( [ zeroapp ] ) .    for harmonic boundary conditions",
    "the differential equation in the outer area is a bit more complicated .",
    "its solution is @xmath100 with the whittaker function @xmath101 .",
    "the condition of differentiability at @xmath102 is also more complicated to evaluate than for the von - neumann or dirichlet boundary conditions , but in the end we get @xmath103 at @xmath87 and @xmath104 at the phase transition @xmath88 .",
    "therefore @xmath105      starting from the partition @xmath106 into the free part ( kinetic part and infrared regularization ) and an interaction part we can easily set up a perturbation series of the partition function as @xmath107 where the expectation values @xmath108 are taken with respect to @xmath109 and @xmath110 is the partition function just for @xmath109 . here",
    "the factor of @xmath111 has been canceled out by introducing a time ordering .",
    "the free energy is the negative logarithm of the partition function and can also be expressed as a series in @xmath54 by systematically expanding the logarithm .",
    "since all correlation functions are translationally invariant in the limit of large @xmath33 , one of the integrations just gives a factor of @xmath33 which cancels out since we are interested in the free energy per length .",
    "as a result of this series expansion we get to the first orders @xmath112 since the structure of the singularities in the case @xmath1 does not show up in the second order , we have to extend the perturbation series to higher orders .",
    "( higher terms of this formula can be found in appendix  [ appexpansions ] . )    for two directed polymers with a @xmath113 interaction it is now particularly simple to calculate the time ordered correlation functions , because they can be reduced to two - point - functions .",
    "consider the propagator @xmath114 of the relative coordinate of the free ( only infrared regularized ) directed polymers . with this",
    ", the multi - point - function is expressed as @xmath115 for long chain length we can drop end effects and assume @xmath116 and @xmath117 to be large enough so that we can combine those terms to a one point function @xmath118 if we here set @xmath119 we get the relation between the return probability @xmath120 and the two point function , so that we can express the multi - point function by two point functions as @xmath121    using this formula , we can express all the coefficients of the perturbation series as multiple integrals over products of two - point functions .",
    "it is even more convenient to introduce the dimension - less connected two point function as @xmath122 if we now introduce a dimension - less coupling constant @xmath123 the finite size coefficient of the free energy per unit `` time '' reads @xmath124{\\rm d}s_1{\\rm d}s_2\\\\\\nonumber & & + o(u_0 ^ 4),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the time - ordered integration has been broken up into integrals over the respective time differences .",
    "as we can see , the finite size coefficient is equal to the dimension - less coupling constant @xmath125 to first order .",
    "singularities in this series can only arise in the integrals of the higher order terms .",
    "the renormalized coupling constant must be defined such that all singularities in the higher order terms are canceled .",
    "this is done by imposing the renormalization point condition for the renormalized coupling constant @xmath126 this renormalization point condition has the advantage , that it gives a physical meaning to the renormalized coupling constant .",
    "now we have to study the perturbation series  ( [ urseries ] ) in detail .",
    "already in the third order the essential difference between the regularization scheme at @xmath127 and at @xmath27 becomes obvious .",
    "near @xmath127 , the second term in the third order coefficient does not diverge at all , so that only the first term , which obviously factorizes to the square of the second order coefficient , produces divergences .",
    "this statement is true to all orders of perturbation theory , which produces just a geometric series of divergences .",
    "the especially simple structure of those divergences guarantees that the @xmath50 function calculated to the second order is exact to all orders of perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "near @xmath27 the situation is totally different , because here also the second term diverges .",
    "so in every order combinations of different types of divergences occur , which do not factorize any more .    since the terms in the perturbation series are becoming quite nasty in higher orders , it is convenient to introduce a graphical representation",
    ". therefore we will draw in the @xmath128-th order @xmath128 points in a line which represent the @xmath128 time stamps involved .",
    "for each function @xmath129 we then draw a line connecting the two time stamps which are the arguments of the two point function . with this representation",
    "we can sketch our series expansion up to higher orders as it is done in appendix  [ appexpansions ] .",
    "careful inspection shows that all diagrams appear that have at least one line passing each interval between two points and do not have two lines leaving one point in the same direction .",
    "the corresponding prefactors up to the seventh order are given by @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the number of lines in the diagram , @xmath132 is the set of points in the diagram and for each @xmath133 @xmath134 denotes the number of lines which pass the given point .",
    "this perturbation series can be further simplified by applying some relations among the integrals over two point functions as for example    ( 348,22)(36,789 ) ( 380,800 ) ( 180,800 ) ( 200,800 ) ( 220,800 ) ( 360,800 ) ( 275,795)(0,0)[lb ] ( 135,795)(0,0)[lb ] ( 320,800 ) ( 340,800 ) ( 240,800 ) ( 220,800 ) ( 40 , 20)[bl ] ( 220,800 ) ( 40 , 20)[br ] ( 200,800 ) ( 40 , 20)[tr ] ( 200,800 ) ( 40 , 20)[tl ] ( 70,800 ) ( 20 , 10)[bl ] ( 70,800 ) ( 20 , 10)[br ] ( 70,800 ) ( 60 , 20)[tr ] ( 70,800 ) ( 60 , 20)[tl ] ( 330,800 ) ( 20 , 10)[tr ] ( 330,800 ) ( 20 , 10)[tl ] ( 40,800 ) ( 60,800 ) ( 80,800 ) ( 100,800 ) ( 360,800 ) ( 40 , 20)[tr ] ( 360,800 ) ( 40 , 20)[tl ]    those relations can be produced by a general mechanism via laplace transformation as explained in detail in appendix  [ appdiagrels ] .    applying them consequently enables us to get rid of all `` nested '' diagrams .",

    "the propagator is just the sum of free propagators connecting equivalent points @xmath217 using @xmath218 as it is defined by @xmath219 , we get ( since @xmath220 ) @xmath221 at @xmath3 @xmath222 , but @xmath223 .    since we know the whole perturbation series",
    ", we can just insert @xmath224 and repeat our above calculations .",
    "the structure of the poles changes , because now the only divergence resides in the arc , which spans 2 intervals .",
    "this leads to the fact that the order of the poles in @xmath29 increases only every second order and the coefficient connected to all poles is @xmath212 .",
    "we take care of this fact by grouping together all singularities with the same powers of @xmath225 .",
    "the structure of the singular part of this series is then very similar to the previous one and the regularization scheme can be used in the same way as before .",
    "the explicit form of the important parts of the perturbation series is shown in appendix  [ appexpreg ] ; in the limit @xmath60 we get the expected result @xmath226 which is the same as if we had taken the limit @xmath216 in our above result",
    ". therefore also the limiting @xmath50 function is @xmath227    there is one more remarkable thing in this @xmath50 function : if we just add up the geometric series of the most singular terms and do not perform the limit @xmath60 , but just insert small @xmath29 we get the @xmath50 functions shown in fig .",

    "we can extract two points .",

    ". moreover we remark that all three truncated @xmath50 functions ( they differ in the divergence order where they are truncated ) have a common root at @xmath229 . the fact that this is true to all calculated orders strongly suggests that these roots are exact , which means that the fixed point approaches zero as @xmath230 which is just equation  ( [ zeroapp ] ) .      for harmonic boundary conditions ,",
    "the zero of the @xmath50 function calculated by the regularized perturbative approaches is exactly equal to the finite size coefficient calculated in the transfer matrix picture .    since the von - neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions in the transfer matrix approach and in the perturbation series are not absolutely equivalent ( in the transfer matrix approach the boundary has a spherical shape ) , those results are not quantitatively comparable .",
    "nevertheless qualitatively also those results are the same as far as the limit @xmath60 is concerned :    in the case of hard wall ( dirichlet ) boundary conditions , the perturbation series predicts a @xmath50 function with a zero at a finite negative value .",
    "this is also the result of the transfer matrix calculation due to the finite value of the ground state energy of the free system .    with periodic ( von - neumann ) boundary conditions ,",
    "the perturbation theory and the transfer matrix approach both predict that @xmath42 approaches zero as @xmath60 and they both result in the square root dependence  ( [ zeroapp ] ) of @xmath29 .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the chosen method of regularization of the perturbation series reproduces the exact results of the transfer matrix approach and therefore is a valid regularization scheme .",
    "now we will develop a diagrammatic expansion of the theory of an arbitrary number of directed polymers @xmath46 interacting by short range interactions .",
    "we will see that the structure shows strong analogies to the case of only two directed polymers , which suggests that the perturbation series can be regularized in the same way as the perturbation series for @xmath52 .        in order to keep the calculations as simple as possible ,",

    "since the argument of a multi - point function is the sum over different @xmath113 interactions , all sums can be extracted from the expectation value . in the @xmath128-th order the sums over @xmath235 correspond to the different ways , the @xmath128 interactions can be arranged among the @xmath46 directed polymers .",
    "obviously a lot of arrangements are equivalent since for example interchanging the polymers that interact should not influence the expectation value of the sequence of interactions .",
    "so every possible arrangement of interactions will be accompanied by a combinatorial prefactor , which counts the number of equivalent arrangements .",
    "the sum over all @xmath235 can then be written as a sum over all possible arrangements with each arrangement multiplied by a convenient combinatorial prefactor .",

    "moreover it is clear from the translational invariance of the propagator that only a dependence on `` time '' differences will arise .",

    "the new integration variables will be made dimension - less by a factor of @xmath37 and we call them @xmath243 .    to calculate the integrands , some simplification techniques can be used and especially two general simplification rules , which we will call lemma  a and b can be derived .",

    ", we will use functions of t - matrices , where all sub - matrices of lower dimensions are subtracted with alternating signs , as for example @xmath263 and analogously for a higher number of loops .",
    "of course the subtracted terms depend on the t - matrix itself and are different , if one chooses different t - matrices which represent the same diagram ( which give the same value for the first term of the above sum ) .",

    "but it is always possible to choose a representation , that leads to terms which are each integrable ( of course the sum of all terms is integrable in every case , it is just possible that one chooses an inconvenient partition of the integrand . )",
    "once the coefficients of the free energy are represented as a sum over time integrals , further simplifications can be performed , by multiplying the integration variables by constant factors and applying all kinds of relations as the ones discussed in appendix  [ appdiagrels ] .    we will continue to represent every of those integrals by one of the diagrams , which is responsible for the main term of the integrand .",
    "since the integrands themselves depend on the way , the loops are chosen , we must specify our choice .",
    "those parts of diagrams , which can be expressed only by @xmath129 ( i.e. which are pure 2-polymer - diagrams ) will be represented by the same diagrams as they have been used in the 2 polymer case .    the resulting diagrammatic expansion for the free energy is shown in fig .  [ fignfreener ] up to the fifth order .",
    "it should be stressed that the number of diagrams involved in this final expansion is very small compared to the number of diagrams in the original perturbation series of the partition function .",
    "since the applicability of most of the simplifying formulas as those from appendix  [ appdiagrels ] relies on very specific relations between the coefficients of the diagrams involved , it is very unlikely that this structure evolves just by chance .",
    "this is a strong hint that there exists a similar equation as  ( [ u0ofurreg ] ) for an arbitrary number of directed polymers , that produces this relatively simple structure of the perturbation series .",
    "unfortunately no such formula could be found up to now .",
    "we can now compare the perturbation series to the perturbation series of two directed polymers .",
    "first there are a lot of diagrams which appear already in the series of two directed polymers , that now have prefactors with a polynomial @xmath46 dependence .",
    "we will call them `` linear '' diagrams , because they have no nested loops .",
    "the value of one arc itself is of course the same as for two directed polymers .",
    "especially only the arc , that spans two intervals has a pole at @xmath60 .",
    "this pole is of the first order .",
    "since we have explicit expressions for all of the diagrams , it is also possible to extract at least the order of the pole of each of the nested diagrams as @xmath60 .",
    "this can be done by extracting the uv dependence of the integrands and partial integration .",
    "it comes out that all nested diagrams are less divergent than the product of two - interval arcs in the same order of the perturbation theory .",
    "therefore , as in the case of two directed polymers , the powers of the two - interval arc are the most divergent diagrams and the order of the pole grows by one only in every second order of the perturbation series .",
    "although we gave here the diagrammatic expansion of the series @xmath264 , the same statements are true for the inverted series @xmath135 , since it consist of exactly the same diagrams with other prefactors .",
    "analogous to the case of two directed polymers , we write the partial sum over all those most divergent diagrams as @xmath265 where @xmath266 is an even function , with taylor coefficients , that stay regular as @xmath60 . if we now assume that the fact that the series for @xmath267 can be analytically continued to @xmath197 and that @xmath268 exists is not a particularity of 2 directed polymers , we get a leading behavior of @xmath269 differentiation then leads to the limiting @xmath50 function @xmath270 the slope of @xmath228 of this @xmath50 function shows that @xmath150 is not just the gaussian fixed point , which would have a slope of @xmath271 . thus we expect that for @xmath60 the non - gaussian fixed point goes to zero for each @xmath46 . since the @xmath50 function is a regular function of @xmath272 also the behavior proportional to @xmath273",
    "is independent of @xmath46 .",
    "the independence of the behavior of the fixed point near @xmath3 renders the limit @xmath45 , which describes the directed polymer in a random medium , trivial .",
    "thus we easily conclude that the finite size amplitude of the free energy per unit `` time '' also vanishes as given in equation  ( [ zeroapp ] ) for the directed polymer in a random medium .",
    "this shows that the singularities in the perturbation series , which arise at @xmath3 are not only a formal problem of the approach , but they lead to a non - analytic behavior of a physical quantity .",
    "although we are surely not able to access the strong coupling fixed point of the kpz equation with these perturbative methods , the shown vanishing of the weak coupling fixed point , which is under the hopf  cole transformation equivalent to the studied interaction fixed point in the directed polymer picture , is a strong hint that @xmath274 is really the upper critical dimension for the kpz problem .",
    "although the duality relations between dimensions @xmath0 and @xmath275 in section  [ duality ] only have been observed in the case @xmath52 , one could speculate that such a relationship still exists for arbitrary @xmath46 and the kpz problem .",
    "this is especially interesting since frey and tuber find in  @xcite that their coupling constant approaches zero in the limit @xmath276 .",
    "surely it is not absolutely clear how the two coupling constants are related and this point deserves further investigations .",
    "we have studied the problem of directed polymers with short range interactions .",
    "the main interest was the behavior of the directed polymer system in the limit @xmath1 , where the normal renormalization treatment , which expands around @xmath41 breaks down .",
    "since for two directed polymers exact transfer matrix results are available , we developed a regularization procedure for the perturbation series in the limit @xmath1 in the special case of two directed polymers .",
    "we could prove that there is an agreement between the transfer matrix results and the predictions of the regularized perturbation series for two directed polymers . moreover an exact implicit equation which generates the whole perturbation series and its connections to the diagrammatic expansion has been studied .    for an arbitrary number of directed polymers , a diagrammatic expansion of the free energy up to the fifth order has been established .",
    "although it stems from a large number of terms this expansion is relatively simple .",
    "this suggests that it can also be generated by a simple equation , which has , however , eluded us so far . since the pole structure of the perturbation series is very similar to the pole structure in the case @xmath52 , the leading behavior of the @xmath50 function in the limit",
    "@xmath1 has been derived .",
    "it shows that the interaction fixed point approaches zero as @xmath1 proportional to @xmath273 independent of @xmath46 .",
    "therefore the weak coupling fixed point of the kpz equation ( which is mapped to the problem of a directed polymer in a random medium ) is also expected to approach 0 proportional to @xmath273 in the limit @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath277 the transfer matrix calculations show for two directed polymers , that the finite size amplitude of the free energy per unit `` time '' at the unbinding transition develops anomalous scaling behavior analogous to that of the free energy in the bound state of the infinite system  @xcite .",
    "the finite size amplitude therefore depends explicitly on the short - distance cutoff .",
    "thus it is no longer possible to define a universal quantity from the free energy .",
    "if this behavior persists for arbitrary @xmath46 , the critical behavior of the kpz equation at the roughening transition above @xmath3 is less universal than below 4 dimensions .",
    "we conclude by noting that the unbinding transition of semi - flexible polymers ( i.e. directed lines which are governed by the curvature instead of a line tension ) with a short - ranged attraction of parallel polymer segments in one transversal dimension formally can be mapped on the problem of two strings in four transversal dimensions . therefore the method studied here can also be applied to examine this unbinding transition  @xcite .",

    "this gives us the equation connecting @xmath302 with @xmath303 and @xmath304 .",
    "this equation will always have the form @xmath305 with some functions @xmath5 and @xmath170 .",
