    "the creation of quantum gases of atoms with large magnetic moments @xcite and ultracold clouds of ground state diatomic polar molecules @xcite strongly stimulated the work in the domain of dipolar cold gases , because the long - range anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction drastically changes the nature of quantum degenerate regimes .",
    "presently , there is a growing number of proposals to study new classes of many - body states in these systems @xcite .",
    "a serious difficulty for studying many - body physics with polar molecules is related to ultracold chemical reactions , such as krb+krb@xmath0k@xmath1+rb@xmath1 observed in the jila experiments @xcite , which lead to a rapid decay of the system at required densities .",
    "therefore , the attention is now shifted to non - reactive molecules , in particular rbcs , nak , and kcs , for which the ultracold chemistry is expected to be energetically unfavorable @xcite .",
    "another route assumes the suppression of chemical reactions for reactive molecules by confining them to the ( quasi)two - dimensional ( 2d ) geometry and orienting their dipole moments ( by a strong electric field ) perpendicularly to the plane of the 2d translational motion @xcite .",
    "this induces a strong intermolecular repulsion , and the suppression of chemical reactions by two orders of magnitude has been already demonstrated @xcite .",
    "therefore , 2d gases of polar molecules attract a special attention , in particular when the molecules are fermionic and they are in the same internal state .",
    "one then has an additional reduction of chemical reactions .",
    "various aspects have been discussed regarding this system in literature , in particular the emergence and beyond mean field description of the topological @xmath2 phase for microwave - dressed polar molecules @xcite , interlayer superfluids in bilayer and multilayer systems @xcite , the emergence of density - wave phases @xcite , and superfluid pairing for tilted dipoles @xcite .",
    "the fermi liquid behavior of this system has been addressed by using the fourier transform of the dipole - dipole interaction potential ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "the many - body theory ( beyond mean field ) describing fermi liquid properties of a weakly interacting 2d gas of identical fermionic dipoles with dipole moments @xmath3 oriented perpendicularly to the plane of their translational motion , has been developed in ref .",
    "the theory relies on the presence of a small parameter @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the fermi momentum , and @xmath6 is the dipole - dipole length , with @xmath7 being the molecule mass . with the use of the low - momentum solution of the scattering problem up to terms @xmath8 ,",
    "thermodynamic quantities were obtained as a series of expansion up to the second order in @xmath4 .",
    "recent monte carlo calculations @xcite confirmed the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite in the low - density limit ( @xmath9 ) and studied a quantum transition to the crystalline phase at high densities .    in some sense , the 2d gas of identical fermionic dipoles perpendicular to the plane of their translational motion , constitutes a novel fermi liquid because the existence of zero sound in this system is provided only by many - body effects @xcite .",
    "this stimulates an interest to zero sound for tilted dipoles and to possibilities for the observation of zero sound modes in experiments . in the present paper",
    "we show that in the 2d gas of identical fermionic tilted dipoles the propagation of zero sound is due to both mean field and many - body effects .",
    "the sound modes are anisotropic , and the anisotropy of the sound velocity is the same as the one of the fermi velocity .",
    "importantly , the damping rate of zero sound can be much lower compared to the damping rate of quasiparticle excitations with the same energy .",
    "this is different from the situation in @xmath10he @xcite , where these damping rates are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the small damping rate of zero sound in the 2d dipolar fermi gas opens wide possibilities for the observation of the sound modes in experiments , in spite of the fact that the zero sound peak is very close to the particle - hole continuum in the structure function .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we give general relations for various quantities of the 2d gas of tilted fermionic dipoles and in section iii we derive the many - body contribution to the interaction function of quasiparticles in this system .",
    "section iv is dedicated to the derivation of our results for the dynamical structure factor and zero sound velocity .",
    "it is in particular shown that for tilted dipoles the second order mean field contribution to this quantity and the many - body contribution are of the same order of magnitude . in sections v and",
    "vi we calculate the relaxation rate of quasiparticles and the damping rate of zero sound , showing that the latter can be much smaller at the same excitation energy .",
    "we conclude in section vii , emphasizing that the slow damping of zero sound provides wide possibilities for the measurement of zero sound modes . aside from the observation of the surface modes in trapped samples , which in the collisionless regime are analogous to zero sound and",
    "have been observed in the 2d atomic fermi gas @xcite , one should be able to observe zero sound in the response to small modulations of the density in ( quasi)uniform gases like those created in the recent experiment @xcite .",
    "in contrast to experiments in liquid @xmath10he , where the observation of zero sound is based on the difference between the zero sound and fermi velocities @xcite , in ultracold gases the zero sound can be observed through the measurement of the dynamical structure factor in two - photon bragg spectroscopy experiments .",
    "this method was successfully developed for bose - condensed gases @xcite and then used for ultracold fermions @xcite .",
    "although the zero sound peak in the structure function is located very close to the particle - hole continuum , it can be visible as it may be higher than the maximum of the continuum due to slow damping of the zero sound .",
    "we consider a 2d gas of single - component fermionic dipoles tilted by an angle @xmath11 with respect to the plane of their translational motion ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "these dipolar particles interact with each other via the potential which at large separations @xmath12 is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the angle between the vector @xmath15 and the @xmath16 axis in which the dipoles are tilted .",

    "the potential @xmath25 becomes partially attractive at sufficiently large tilting angles @xmath11 , providing a possibility of superfluid pairing .",
    "this occurs at @xmath11 exceeding a critical value @xmath29 @xcite . assuming the absence of superfluid pairing the ground state of the system is a fermi liquid and one",
    "may use the landau theory relying on the existence of  dressed particles  , or quasiparticles .",
    "at @xmath30 the momentum distribution of free quasiparticles is the step function @xmath31 i.e. @xmath32 for @xmath33 and zero otherwise.the chemical potential is equal to the boundary energy at the fermi circle , @xmath34 .",
    "the quasiparticle energy @xmath35 is a variational derivative of the total energy with respect to the distribution function @xmath36 .",
    "due to the interaction between quasiparticles , the deviation @xmath37 of this distribution from the step function ( [ nstep ] ) results in a change of the quasiparticle energy : @xmath38 the interaction function of quasiparticles @xmath39 is thus the second variational derivative of the total energy with regard to @xmath36 .",

    ".    the knowledge of the interaction function of quasiparticles allows one to calculate the compressibility relying only on the integration on the fermi surface .",
    "one then obtains straightforwardly the chemical potential , ground state energy , and other thermodynamic quantities .",
    "this idea belongs to landau @xcite and it was pushed forward by abrikosov and khalatnikov @xcite and implemented for a two - component 3d fermi gas with a weak contact repulsion , revealing many - body ( beyond mean field ) effects and reproducing the results of an earlier ( direct ) calculation of lee - huang - yang @xcite .",
    "the many - body theory relying on the abrikosov - khalatnikov approach has been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite for 2d fermionic single - component dipoles perpendicular to the plane of their translational motion ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "this theory accounts for the short - range physics in the scattering properties and represents thermodynamic quantities as a series of expansion in the small parameter @xmath4 up to the second order .",
    "the construction of a similar theory for tilted dipoles requires extremely cumbersome calculations and is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "instead , we intend to reveal the properties of zero sound .",
    "a distinguished feature of tilted 2d fermionic dipoles is a small anisotropy of the fermi surface .",
    "the related corrections to the fermi momentum , chemical potential , etc . , are proportional to @xmath4 , and we omit higher order corrections .",

    "in contrast to strongly interacting systems , in the weakly interacting regime the quasiparticle energy is well defined at any momenta , not only near the fermi surface .",
    "one may write : @xmath48 and take into account that exactly on the fermi surface the quasiparticle energy is zero : @xmath49 in order to express the fermi momentum through the density @xmath50 and the interaction strength , one has to solve equations ( [ epsilonk ] ) and ( [ epsilonkf ] ) selfconsistently with the particle number equation @xmath51 integrating the right - hand side of this equation one has @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the angle between the vector @xmath54 and the @xmath16 axis . turning back to equation ( [ epsilonkf ] ) we notice that to linear order in @xmath4 one may use the distribution function of a non - interacting fermi gas @xmath55 and put the interaction function of quasiparticles expressed through the fourier transforms of the interaction potential @xmath25 @xcite : @xmath56   \\nonumber \\\\ & & = 2\\pi d^2|{\\bf p}-{\\bf p}'|(\\cos^{2}\\theta_0-\\sin^{2}\\theta_0\\cos^{2}\\phi_{{\\bf p}-{\\bf p } ' } )",

    "this condition is easily fulfilled even for rather small @xmath4 . for realistic systems one can think of the zero sound frequency of the order of a few tens or hundreds of hertz , whereas the fermi energy can easily be a few kilohertz ( a few hundreds of nanokelvins ) , so that the ratio @xmath367 exceeds @xmath368 . under the condition ( [ c ] )",

    "it can be easily resolved as the relative frequency of the two bragg beams can be controlled on the level of a hertz .",
    "owing to a remarkable progress in experiments with ultracold quantum gases , it is also promising to directly observe the propagation of zero sound in the 2d dipolar fermi gas . using a tightly - focused and far detuned laser beam",
    "one can create a potential to introduce a localized density modulation in the gas , without heating it . this technique has been used to directly study the propagation of sound in bose - einstein condensates @xcite and in resonantly interacting fermi gases @xcite . in our system , the far detuned laser can be focused to the center of the 2d sample , and one can choose a proper power and shape of the excitation pulse to resonantly drive the desired zero sound mode ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "after the zero sound mode is excited , one can observe the time evolution of the density profile and thus extract the information on the propagation of the mode .",
    "incoherent particle - hole excitations will also be excited during the pulse .",
    "however , as we have shown above , the decay of the zero sound is slower than that of particle - hole excitation . after a time of the order of a fraction of the zero sound damping time @xmath363 ,",
    "let say @xmath374 or @xmath375 , quasiparticle excitations are damped out and one is expected to see only the zero sound contribution to modulations of the density .",

    "<S> we study zero sound in a weakly interacting 2d gas of single - component fermionic dipoles ( polar molecules or atoms with a large magnetic moment ) tilted with respect to the plane of their translational motion . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the propagation of zero sound is provided by both mean field and many - body ( beyond mean field ) effects , and the anisotropy of the sound velocity is the same as the one of the fermi velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the damping of zero sound modes can be much slower than that of quasiparticle excitations of the same energy . </S>",
    "<S> one thus has wide possibilities for the observation of zero sound modes in experiments with 2d fermionic dipoles , although the zero sound peak in the structure function is very close to the particle - hole continuum . </S>"
