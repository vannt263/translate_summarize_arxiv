    "astrophysical jets are one of the most important and interesting subject in astrophysics .",
    "they have been observed in various spatial scales , e.g. in young stellar objects ( ysos ) ( e.g. , fukui et al .",
    "1993 ; ogura 1995 ; furuya et al .",
    "1999 ) , active galactic nuclei ( e.g. , bridle & perley 1984 ; kubo et al .",
    "1998 ) , and x - ray binaries ( e.g. , margon 1984 ; mirabel & rodriguez 1994 ; kotani et al .",
    "1996 ) . the acceleration and collimation mechanisms of jets are still not made clear and various models have been proposed ( e.g. , ferrari 1998 ; meier , koide , & uchida 2001 ; bisnovatyi - kogan & lovelace 2001 ) .",
    "one of the most promising models is magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) acceleration from accretion disks .",
    "lovelace ( 1976 ) and blandford ( 1976 ) first pointed out that electromagnetic force can extract energy and angular momentum from accretion disks and that the plasma is accelerated relativistically in two opposite directions .",
    "blandford & payne ( 1982 ) showed that a magneto - centrifugally driven outflow from a keplerian disk is possible when an angle between the poloidal magnetic field lines and the surface of the accretion disk is less than @xmath12 .",
    "they discussed self - similar solutions of the steady and axisymmetric mhd equations and the possibility of such acceleration and collimation of the flow from a cold keplerian disk .",
    "kudoh & shibata ( 1995 , 1997a ) solved 1-dimensional steady and axisymmetric mhd equations and investigated properties of steady mhd jet .",
    "they found that the steady mhd jet can be divided into two classes ; one is the magneto - centrifugally driven jet when the magnetic field is strong and the other is the magnetic pressure driven jet when the field is weak .",
    "the former has dependences of the jet velocity ( @xmath13 ) and mass outflow rate ( @xmath14 ) on magnetic energy ( @xmath15 ) as @xmath16 , @xmath17 constant and the latter has dependences as @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "this mass flux scaling law was confirmed by ustyugova et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "on the other hand , uchida & shibata ( 1985 ) and shibata & uchida ( 1986 , 1987 ) performed time - dependent 2-dimensional axisymmetric ( 2.5-dimensional ) mhd numerical simulations of magnetically driven jets from accretion disks .",
    "they solved the interaction between a geometrically thin rotating disk and a large - scale magnetic field that was initially uniform and vertical .",
    "shibata & uchida ( 1986 ) investigated the dependence of the jet velocity on the magnetic field strength .",
    "the jet velocity increases as the magnetic field strength increases in a manner similar to michel s scaling law ( michel 1969 ) but is typically of the order of the disk s keplerian velocity .",
    "kudoh , matsumoto , & shibata ( 1998 ) showed the following results : the dependences of the jet velocity ( @xmath20 ) and mass outflow rate ( @xmath21 ) on the initial magnetic field strength are approximately @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath6 is the initial poloidal magnetic field strength and @xmath24 is the angular velocity of the field line ( the angular velocity of the footpoint on the accretion disk ) .",
    "these are consistent with the results of 1-dimensional steady solutions although the jet and accretion never reach a steady state .",
    "it is also obtained that the dependence of the mass accretion rate ( @xmath25 ) on the initial field strength is given by @xmath26 .",
    "in addition to these studies , the acceleration and collimation of the jet have been studied in the steady ( e.g. , sauty , trussoni , & tsinganos 2004 ; bogovalov & tsinganos 2005 ) and nonsteady framework ( e.g. , matsumoto et al . 1996 ; kato et al .",
    "2002 ; krasnopolsky , li , & blandford 2003 ; see also shibata & kudoh 1999 for a review ) . in recent years , interesting simulations taking other physical processes , e.g. , the magnetic diffusion ( kuwabara et al . 2000 ; fendt & emelji 2002 ; casse & keppens 2002 , 2004 ) , the dynamo process in the accretion disk ( von rekowski et al . 2003 ) , the radiation force ( proga 2003 ) into consideration have been performed .",
    "koide , shibata , & kudoh ( 1999 ) showed that a magnetically driven jet in the general relativistic mhd simulation has the characteristics similar to those of the nonrelativistic mhd jet ( shibata & uchida 1986 ) .",
    "these works , however , assume the axisymmetry , so that instabilities having non - axisymmetric modes are eliminated .",
    "it is very interesting whether jets are stable against the non - axisymmetric modes or not .",
    "can jets be ejected in the same manner with the axisymmetric cases ?",
    "the stability of propagating jet has been studied by taking the accretion disk as the fixed boundary condition in 2-d mhd ( e.g. , ustyugova et al .",
    "1995 ; ouyed & pudritz 1997a , b , 1999 ; romanova et al . 1998",
    "; hardee & rosen 1999 , 2002 ; frank et al .",
    "2000 ) , 3-d mhd ( nakamura , uchida , & hirose 2001 ; ouyed , clarke , & pudritz 2003 ; nakamura & meier 2004 ) , and 3-d spmhd ( smoothed particle mhd ) simulations ( cerqueira & de gouveia dal pino 2001 ) .",
    "the 3-dimensional treatment is necessary for investigating the stability of the jet against the non - axisymmetric modes .",
    "magnetically driven jets have a helical magnetic field because accretion disks twist the magnetic field by their own rotation .",
    "the generated toroidal magnetic field propagates along the magnetic field as torsional alfvn waves .",
    "it is equivalent that current flows in the jets .",
    "the current may cause a current - driven instability and jets may be deformed .",
    "nakamura et al . ( 2001 ) showed that the helical kink instability can explain the wiggled structures which are often observed ( krichbaum et al .",
    "1990 ; hummel et al . 1992 ; conway & murphy 1993 ; roos , kaastra , & hummel 1993 ; hutchison , cawthorne , & gabuzda 2001 ; stirling et al .",
    "the mhd model can also explain some characteristics of polarization observations of agn jets .",
    "some agn jets show spine+sheath @xmath27-field structures , which consist of the transverse field in the central region and the longitudinal field becoming dominant in some regions offset from the jet axis ; it is thought that the transverse field is the result of shock compression and that the longitudinal field is due to the effect of shear between a jet and a surrounding medium ( e.g. , attridge , roberts , & wardle 1999 ) .",
    "gabuzda ( 2003 ) , however , pointed out that jets dominated by toroidal field can display the spine+sheath structure .",
    "uchida et al . (",
    "2004 ) showed this point numerically ( see figure 5a and 6a of uchida et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ) . besides this",
    ", rotation measure gradients perpendicular to the jet axis ( asada et al .",
    "2002 ; gabuzda , murray , & cronin 2004 ; zavala & taylor 2005 ) and a distribution of rotation measure associated with the jet deformation ( feretti et al .",
    "1999 ) are reproduced numerically by the mhd model ( uchida et al .",
    "2004 ; kigure et al .",
    "it can be said that these points indicate advantages of the mhd model .",
    "only a few 3-dimensional mhd simulations of jet formation with solving the accretion disk self - consistently have been presented ( e.g. , matsumoto & shibata 1997 ; matsumoto 1999 ; matsumoto & shibata 1999 ; kigure et al .",
    "2002 ) although global ( not adopting the shearing box approximation ) 3-dimensional mhd simulations of the accretion disk around the black hole are vigorously done in recent years ( e.g. , hawley 2000 ; hawley & krolik 2001 ; machida & matsumoto 2003 ) . in this paper , we study the stability of the jet launched from the accretion disk by 3-dimensional mhd simulations .",
    "we investigate the connection between the non - axisymmetric structure in the jet and that in the disk , and compare the characteristics ( e.g. , the dependence of the jet velocity on the magnetic field strength ) of jets found in 3-dimensional simulations with those of jets found in 2.5-dimensional simulations and in steady state models . in  2 , we describe the numerical method and the initial and boundary conditions . in  3 , we present results of our simulations . a discussion and conclusions are in  4 and  5 .",
    "we solve the following ideal mhd equations numerically : @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the density , pressure , and velocity of the gas respectively .",

    "after the jet ejection , the @xmath8 mode becomes comparable to or predominant over the @xmath197 mode though , roughly speaking , the fourier power spectrum is larger the longer ( the smaller ) the azimuthal wave length ( wave number ) is . as same as in the model s6 , the growth of each mode in the disk shows oscillation though it can not be seen in the jet . it can be thought that the oscillation in the disk is related to the mass accretion ( see also the bottom panel of figure [ fig13 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath8 mode is initially dominant in the jet , which is probably connected to the peak in the disk at @xmath196 . in response to the decrease of the @xmath8 mode spectrum in the disk , that in the jet also decreases .",
    "however the @xmath8 mode spectrum becomes comparable to the @xmath197 mode spectrum later .",
    "it is to be noted that the power spectra of all the non - axisymmetric modes become nearly constant with time in the jet as well as in the case of the sinusoidally perturbed disk .",
    "figure [ fig18 ] shows the distribution of the magnetic energy and the logarithmic density on the @xmath193 plane ( in the disk ) at @xmath198 and on the @xmath194 plane ( in the jet ) at @xmath199 .",
    "what mechanism makes the non - axisymmetric structure ? in the previous section ,",
    "it is made clear that the non - axisymmetric structure in the jet originates in the accretion disk . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the cause of the non - axisymmetric structure in the disk . at first , the possibility of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; balbus & hawley 1991 ) is examined .",
    "the dispersion relation for the non - axisymmetric disturbance was given by balbus & hawley ( 1992 ) ( see the equation 2.24 in that paper ) .",
    "the dispersion relation equation is numerically solved ; from the simulation result ( e.g. , figure [ fig18]a ) @xmath200 . the radial coordinate , @xmath201 in the equation , is assumed to be 1.0 , where the avalanche - like accretion flow is initially remarkably formed . the axial wave length @xmath202 is assumed to be 0.35 , which is almost equal to the most unstable wavelength , @xmath203 . from the initial condition , @xmath204 and @xmath205 at @xmath206 .",
    "the epicyclic frequency @xmath207 is zero because of the constant angular momentum disk .",
    "the azimuthal wave number @xmath9 is the parameter .",
    "one of the four roots is the unstable solution in all the ( @xmath9=1@xmath2086 ) cases .",
    "the growth rate is higher the smaller the azimuthal wave number @xmath9 is , although the @xmath8 growth rate is comparable to the @xmath197 growth rate .",
    "the calculated growth rate , @xmath209 , of the @xmath8 mode is about 0.54 , and @xmath210 at @xmath211 is 5.1 .",
    "the numerical result shows the increase of the @xmath8 mode spectrum by a factor of 5.9 .",
    "these are consistent with the initial evolution of the modes in the disk ( see figure [ fig17]a ) .",
    "after about @xmath211 , the mode spectra show the non - linear growth .",
    "the temporal dominance of @xmath8 mode in the disk in the model r6 is at the mri non - linear growth stage .",
    "we briefly comment on the possibility of other instabilities .",
    "as showed in  4.1 , the k - h instabilities are stable between the jet and the ambient gas . how about between the accretion disk and the corona ?",
    "in our simulations , they seem to be stable or the growth rates seem to be small because no growth of the k - h instabilities is seen in the hydrodynamic ( no magnetic field ) simulation . another probable instability is a magnetic analogue of the non - axisymmetric hydrodynamical instability in the constant angular momentum torus , so - called papaloizou - pringle instability ( papaloizou & pringle 1984 ; goldreich , goodman , & narayan 1986 ; hawley 1990 ) .",
    "curry & pudritz ( 1996 ) investigated the growth rate of the instability in various conditions . according to their result , the ( magnetic )",
    "pp instability seems not to make an important contribution for forming the non - axisymmetric structure .",
    "the magnetic field is relatively weak ( normalized alfvn velocity , @xmath212 in curry & pudritz , is equal to 0.056 ) so that it is almost hydrodynamic .",
    "indeed , the plasma-@xmath213 in the disk is of the order of a hundred .",
    "in such case , the growth rate is small .      differentially rotating disks with a magnetic field",
    "amplify its magnetic field by the mri . in this section",
    "we investigate the difference of the amplification depending on the form of the perturbation .",
    "figure [ fig19 ] shows the time variation of the magnetic energy in the disk .",
    "the definition of the disk is the same as that in the previous section .",
    "the solid line is the magnetic energy in all the region of the disk ( @xmath214 ) , where @xmath215 is the volume of the disk .",
    "the broken line is the magnetic energy only in the inner region ( @xmath216 ) of the disk and the dash - dotted line is the magnetic energy only in the outer region ( @xmath217 ) of the disk .",
    "the magnetic energy in the disk is most amplified in the axisymmetric case .",
    "the magnetic energy in the inner region displays a striking difference between the axisymmetric case and the other two cases though the magnetic energy in the outer region is almost the same .",
    "the total magnetic energy at @xmath218 , therefore , shows the difference .",
    "the differences from the value for the model a6 are -0.051 and -0.034 for the model s6 and r6 respectively .",
    "the time variation of the magnetic energy is described by the following equation . @xmath219 where @xmath220 .",
    "the first term in the right hand means the conversion of magnetic energy to kinetic energy by the lorentz force .",
    "the second term is the transportation of the energy by poynting flux .",
    "it is investigated below that a difference of the value of the first or second term in the equation ( [ eqvamagene ] ) can explain the difference of the magnetic energy .",
    "figure [ fig20]a shows the work done by the lorentz force in the disk ( @xmath221 ; a negative value means kinetic energy is converted to magnetic energy ) .",
    "the time integration of the work done by lorentz force between @xmath222 and @xmath218 is done to investigate the origin of the difference in the magnetic energy between the different models , a6 , s6 , and r6 . for discussing the amplification of the magnetic energy ,",
    "the sign should be inverted .",
    "the results are 0.32 , 0.26 , and 0.34 for the model a6 , s6 , and r6 respectively",
    ". the differences from the value for the model a6 are -0.051 and 0.022 for the model s6 and r6 respectively .",
    "the another term is the energy transportation by poynting flux . to calculate this value ,",
    "the vector normal to the disk surface must be determined .",
    "however that is difficult , so that , for simplicity , the `` disk surface '' is defined as the @xmath194 plane ( @xmath223 ) and the @xmath224 plane ( @xmath225 ) .",
    "figure [ fig20]b shows the value of @xmath226 as functions of time for the model a6 ( solid line ) , s6 ( broken line ) , and r6 ( dash - dotted line ) .",
    "the results of the time integral of this value between @xmath222 and @xmath218 are -0.11 , -0.10 , and -0.11 for the model a6 , s6 , and r6 respectively ( the sign is inverted for discussing the amplification of the magnetic energy ) . the differences from the value for the model a6 are 0.01 ( s6 ) and 0.0 ( r6 ) .",
    "as regards the model s6 , the difference of the magnetic energy from that for the model a6 at @xmath218 can be explained by the difference of the work done by the lorentz force , ignoring the contribution of poynting flux . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetic energy for the model r6 should become larger than that for the model a6 by 0.022 .",
    "the magnetic energy for the model r6 at @xmath218 is , however , smaller than that for the model a6 by 0.034 .",
    "it means that the magnetic energy is dissipated by 0.056 .",
    "the dissipation takes place at the inner region @xmath227 of the disk ( see figure [ fig19 ] ) .",
    "one possibility is the numerical magnetic reconnection . to confirm this point , resistive mhd simulations are necessary .",
    "it is to be noted that the magnetic reconnection in the innermost region of the accretion disk is proposed to be the origin of x - ray shots observed in black hole candidates ( machida & matsumoto 2003 ) . in any case",
    ", the physical process at the inner region of the disk seems to be important .",
    "table [ ars ] , [ sprs ] , and [ rprs ] summarize several physical values calculated from the simulation result of the axisymmetric , the sinusoidal perturbation , and the random perturbation case respectively .",
    "the second column shows the initial space - averaged magnetic energy in the disk .",
    "the space - average of a certain physical quantity , @xmath228 , is calculated as follows : @xmath229 , where @xmath182 is the volume of the disk .",
    "the definition of the disk is the same as in  4.2 .",
    "the third one shows the maximum space - averaged magnetic energy in the disk .",
    "the fourth one indicates the maximum amplification rate of the magnetic energy in the disk .",
    "the runs with the sinusoidal perturbation display the smallest amplification rates in all the magnetic field strength cases compared with the other two perturbation models .",
    "this is explained by the fact that in the sinusoidal perturbation case the work done by the lorentz force is the smallest ( see section [ ampmag ] ) .",
    "the rate for the random perturbation case is comparable to that for the axisymmetric case when the initial magnetic field strength is relatively small ; however the rate for the random perturbation case becomes clearly smaller than that for the axisymmetric case as the initial magnetic field becomes strong .",
    "this may be because the magnetic energy dissipates by the numerical magnetic reconnection as discussed in section [ ampmag ] .",
    "the fifth column shows the time - averaged ratio of the @xmath230-component of the space - averaged maxwell stress to the space - averaged pressure .",
    "this value corresponds to the non - dimensional viscous parameter ( so - called @xmath47 parameter ) .",
    "the @xmath47 parameter means the efficiency of the angular momentum transport . in all the three ( axisymmetric , sinusoidal perturbation , or random perturbation ) cases ,",
    "this parameter @xmath231 increases with increasing the initial magnetic field strength .",
    "this is equivalent to the fact that the mass accretion rate increases with increasing the initial magnetic field .",
    "the sixth column is the time - averaged ratio of the @xmath232-component of the space - averaged maxwell stress to the space - averaged pressure .",
    "this value represents the efficiency of the angular momentum transport in the vertical direction .",
    "when we denote @xmath233 , we find @xmath234 is @xmath235 ; on the other hand @xmath234 becomes @xmath236 when @xmath237 is fitted .",
    "however , @xmath238 and @xmath237 are comparable in the wide range of initial magnetic field strength .",
    "the last column shows the space- and time - averaged plasma-@xmath213 in the disk .",
    "finally we comment on the fact that the dynamical time of our simulations is about 2 orbital periods ( strictly speaking , the dynamical time ranges from one a bit smaller than 2 orbital periods to about 2.5 orbital periods , depending on the initial magnetic field strength ) . in our simulations ,",
    "the numerical instability often occurred at around 2 rotations of the inner part of the disk by the violently deformed magnetic field .",
    "plasma is created even locally , that region becomes the site of the numerical instability , since the magnetic energy is dominant so that any small error of the magnetic field affects the plasma dynamics significantly .",
    "our problems are such ones that include locally low-@xmath213 plasma : even if the magnetic field is initially weak in a disk , it is significantly amplified by the differential rotation of the disk to produce locally low-@xmath213 regions . ]",
    "it has often been said that the jets in nonsteady mhd simulations are transient phenomena owing to the particular choice of the initial conditions",
    ". however , ibrahim , sato , & shibata ( 2004 ) , k. sato et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , and a. ibrahim et al . ( in preparation ) performed long - term simulations of mhd jet though the parameters of the accretion disk are different from the parameters in this paper .",
    "they showed that time - averages of the jet velocity , mass outflow rate , and mass accretion rate reproduce the scaling law found in kudoh et al .",
    "( 1998 ) although the jets are nonsteady and intermittent .",
    "these facts indicate the significance of our results regardless of the short calculation time .",
    "it is , of course , interesting whether the instabilities in the jet itself ( e.g. , the kink and/or k - h instabilities ) develop after a long - time evolution .",
    "this is an important future work .",
    "we performed 3-dimensional mhd simulations of jet formation by solving the accretion disk self - consistently .",
    "the accretion disk is perturbed with the non - axisymmetric sinusoidal or random fluctuation of the rotational velocity to investigate the stability of mhd jet ejected from the disk in 3-dimension .",
    "our results are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the jet launched from the accretion disk whose rotational velocity is non - axisymmetrically perturbed has the properties that the jet velocity is proportional to @xmath239 and that the mass outflow rate is proportional to @xmath6 , where @xmath6 is the initial magnetic field strength .",
    "the dependence of the mass accretion rate ( @xmath160 ) on the initial magnetic field strength is given by @xmath5 .",
    "the first relation is consistent with the scaling law of the michel s solution ( michel 1969 ) and the result of the axisymmetric simulation ( kudoh et al .",
    "the other two relations are also consistent with kudoh et al .",
    "part of fluid elements , however , show the trajectories remarkably different from those in the axisymmetric case .",
    "this is caused by the decrease in the magnetic pressure gradient and centrifugal force in the radial direction those are against the magnetic tension ( hoop stress ) .",
    "2 .   the jet in both perturbation cases shows the non - axisymmetric structure with @xmath8 , where @xmath9 means the azimuthal wave number . as the origin of the non - axisymmetric structure ,",
    "the k - h instability is ruled out according to the stability condition .",
    "calculation of the fourier power spectra of the magnetic energy shows that the @xmath8 mode becomes dominant in the jet at least once .",
    "the time evolution of the power spectra indicates that the non - axisymmetric structure in the jet originates in the accretion disk , not in the jet itself . in both perturbation cases ,",
    "all the non - axisymmetric modes in the jet reach almost constant levels after about 1.5 orbital periods of the accretion disk , while all modes in the accretion disk grow with oscillation .",
    "the magnetic energy is amplified in the accretion disk by the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) . in the non - axisymmetric cases , amplification rates are smaller than that in the axisymmetric case .",
    "the difference between the axisymmetric case and the non - axisymmetric cases is notable in the inner region of the accretion disk . in the sinusoidal perturbation case , this is explained by the difference of the work done by the lorentz force . in the random perturbation case , however , that can not be explained by such difference or the difference of the energy transportation by poynting flux .",
    "one possibility is the numerical reconnection in the inner region of the accretion disk .",
    "4 .   the space- and time - averaged ratio of the maxwell stress component that is related to the angular momentum transport in the radial direction to gas pressure , @xmath240 , shows the dependence on the initial magnetic field strength like @xmath241 .",
    "that for the maxwell stress component that is related to the angular momentum transport in the vertical direction shows the dependence like @xmath242 .",
    "however , @xmath237 is comparable to @xmath238 in the wide range of the initial magnetic field strength .    this work is partly supported by the japan society for the promotion of science japan - uk cooperation science program ( principal investigators : k. shibata and n. o. weiss ) , and the grant - in - aid for the 21st century coe `` center for diversity and universality in physics '' from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) of japan .",
