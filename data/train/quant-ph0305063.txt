    "kvn formulated classical mechanics in a hilbert space made up of complex square integrable functions over the phase space variables @xmath6 .",
    "in particular they postulated , as equation of evolution for @xmath6 , the liouville equation itself : @xmath7 starting from ( [ liopsi ] ) it is easy to prove that , since the liouvillian @xmath2 contains only first order derivatives , the liouville equation ( [ liorho ] ) for the probability densities @xmath0 can be derived via the postulate @xmath8",
    ". finally kvn imposed on the states of their hilbert space the following scalar product : @xmath9 with this choice the liouvillian @xmath2 is a hermitian operator . therefore @xmath10 is a conserved quantity and @xmath11 can be consistently interpreted as the probability density of finding a particle in a point of the phase space .",
    "now every theory formulated via states and operators in a hilbert space can be formulated also via path integrals .",
    "it was proved in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite that it is possible to describe the evolution ( [ liopsi ] ) in the following manner : @xmath12 where we have indicated with @xmath13 all the phase space variables .",

    "the @xmath18 in the weight of the path integral ( [ path ] ) is given by : @xmath19 having a path integral we can introduce the concept of a commutator as feynman did in the quantum case : given two functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 , we can evaluate the following quantity under the path integral ( [ path ] ) : @xmath22 \\equiv\\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0}\\langle o_{\\scriptscriptstyle 1}(t+\\epsilon)o_{\\scriptscriptstyle 2}(t)-o_{\\scriptscriptstyle 2 } ( t+\\epsilon)o_{\\scriptscriptstyle 1}(t)\\rangle$ ] .",
    "what we get is @xcite : @xmath23=0,\\qquad\\quad [ \\hat{\\lambda}_a,\\hat{\\lambda}_b]=0 , \\qquad\\quad [ \\hat{\\varphi}^a,\\hat{\\lambda}_b]=i\\delta_b^a . \\label{comm}\\ ] ] the first commutator of ( [ comm ] ) tells us that the positions @xmath24 commute with the momenta @xmath25 , i.e. that we are doing classical and not quantum mechanics .",
    "the last commutator instead tells us the @xmath26 are something like the momenta conjugate to @xmath27 . in order to satisfy ( [ comm ] )",
    "we can use the representation in which @xmath27 is a multiplicative operator and @xmath26 a derivative one : @xmath28 via the previous operatorial realization , the @xmath18 of ( [ liouvilliano ] ) can also be turned into an operator : @xmath29 therefore @xmath2 is just the liouville operator of eq .",
    "( [ liouv ] ) .",
    "this confirms that the operatorial formalism lying behind the path integral ( [ path ] ) is nothing more than the kvn one .",
    "the main problem we are interested in this paper is the quantization of classical mechanics , once it is formulated via operatorial or path integral techniques .",
    "we know that usually the quantization of a system is performed via the dirac s correspondence rules , i.e. by replacing the classical poisson brackets @xmath30 by commutators according to the following relation : @xmath31_{\\scriptscriptstyle qm}}{i\\hbar}.\\ ] ] now , in classical mechanics formulated  la kvn , the poisson brackets are already replaced by the kvn commutators ( [ comm ] ) .",
    "so the quantization of the system can be performed : either finding suitable rules to go from the kvn commutators to the quantum ones ; or finding a way to reproduce the algebra of quantum observables using kvn commutators and operators.in this paper we will find a compact way to implement the second alternative , by using the fact that the set of hermitian operators in the kvn theory includes also operators depending on @xmath32 and not only the functions @xmath33 .",
    "in particular in * sec .",
    "2 * we will introduce the following map : @xmath34 where the domain of @xmath35 is made up of all the standard classical observables @xmath33 while the image of @xmath35 is made up of suitable hermitian operators living in the kvn hilbert space and depending also on @xmath32 . using the kvn commutators ( [ comm ] ) all the functions of the form @xmath36 which appear on the rhs of ( [ mapq ] ) satisfy exactly the algebra of the observables of quantum mechanics .",
    "so we can say that , among all the operators of the kvn hilbert space , there is a set whose algebra is isomorphic to the algebra of quantum observables .",
    "the most interesting feature of our approach is the split between the _ quantum _ observables of the rhs of ( [ mapq ] ) and the _ classical _ ones @xmath33 . in particular in * sec .",
    "3 * we will show that , while the classical energy @xmath37 commutes with the liouvillian @xmath2 , the associated quantum energy is not conserved under the evolution generated by @xmath2 . therefore , in order to preserve the conservation of energy , we must replace also the liouvillian @xmath2 with a more complicated object @xmath38 which is well known in the literature because it is the moyal operator which appears in the equation of evolution of the wigner functions @xcite .",
    "this replacement is the first step necessary in order to go from the classical path integral ( [ path ] ) to the quantum one .",
    "the second step is a sort of polarization prescription which reduces the kvn hilbert space to the standard hilbert space of quantum mechanics . in * sec .",
    "4 * we will see how this polarization procedure can be justified by requiring the irreducibility of the hilbert space of quantum mechanics under the action of the _ quantum _ observables . in the * conclusions * we will outline some of the possible future applications of the content of this paper .",
    "usually physicists identify the observables of classical mechanics with the functions of the phase space variables @xmath39 . in the operatorial approach to classical mechanics",
    "such observables become the functions of the commuting operators @xmath27 .",

    "the mean values and the probability distributions of the classical observables are completely independent of the phases of the wave functions @xmath47 and only the modulus @xmath48 is significant from a physical point of view @xcite .    besides the operators @xmath27 in the operatorial formulation of classical mechanics we have also the operators @xmath26 which allow us to generate a non trivial evolution via the liouvillian @xmath18 of eq .",
    "( [ liouvilliano ] ) .",
    "such operators @xmath26 do not commute with @xmath27 and this immediately suggests that it might be possible to construct a non abelian algebra of operators by considering suitable combinations of @xmath43 and @xmath32",
    ". in particular it would be very interesting to discover whether it is possible to reproduce , using only the kvn commutators ( [ comm ] ) , the non abelian algebra of quantum observables . in order to do this",
    "we can define the following operators , known in the literature on wigner functions as bopp operators , @xcite : @xmath49 via the kvn commutators ( [ comm ] ) it is very easy to prove that they satisfy the usual heisenberg algebra : @xmath50=i\\hbar\\delta_{jk}$ ] .",
    "since both @xmath43 and @xmath32 are hermitian under the kvn scalar product ( [ scalar ] ) we have that also @xmath51 and @xmath52 are hermitian operators with the same scalar product . not only , but the _ classical _ operators @xmath53 and @xmath54 can be obtained from the associated _ quantum _ ones in the limit @xmath55 .",
    "we would like to stress that the _ quantum _ positions and momenta are now different  entities \" than the _ classical _ ones .",
    "this may be difficult to accept but at the same time it may be the crucial element which makes quantum mechanics so counter - intuitive and different from classical mechanics .",
    "the rules ( [ rules ] ) can be easily generalized and the quantum operator @xmath56 associated to the classical observable @xmath33 will be given by the following function : @xmath57 since @xmath43 and @xmath32 do not commute it is clear that in ( [ capeffe ] ) we must specify also the ordering used .",
    "the one we choose , once we expand ( [ capeffe ] ) in @xmath58 , is the following : @xmath59 the operators @xmath56 are hermitian under the kvn scalar product ( [ scalar ] ) and , since the basic commutators @xmath50=i\\hbar\\delta_{jk}$ ] are satisfied by the choice ( [ rules ] ) , the hermitian functions of @xmath51 and @xmath52 given by ( [ capeffe ] ) or ( [ expansion ] ) will satisfy the correct quantum commutators . for example the three components of the angular momentum turn out to be : @xmath60 -\\frac{1}{4}\\hbar^2\\bigl[\\hat{\\lambda}_{p_y}\\hat{\\lambda}_z-\\hat{\\lambda}_y\\hat{\\lambda}_{p_z}\\bigr]\\medskip \\\\   \\displaystyle \\hat{m}_y=\\hat{z}\\hat{p}_x-\\hat{x}\\hat{p}_z-\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\bigl[\\hat{\\lambda}_z\\hat{x}-\\hat{\\lambda}_{x } \\hat{z}+\\hat{\\lambda}_{p_z}\\hat{p}_x-\\hat{\\lambda}_{p_x}\\hat{p}_z\\bigr ] -\\frac{1}{4}\\hbar^2\\bigl[\\hat{\\lambda}_{p_z}\\hat{\\lambda}_x-\\hat{\\lambda}_z\\hat{\\lambda}_{p_x}\\bigr]\\medskip \\\\   \\displaystyle \\hat{m}_z=\\hat{x}\\hat{p}_y-\\hat{y}\\hat{p}_x-\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\bigl[\\hat{\\lambda}_x\\hat{y}-\\hat{\\lambda}_{y } \\hat{x}+\\hat{\\lambda}_{p_x}\\hat{p}_y-\\hat{\\lambda}_{p_y}\\hat{p}_x\\bigr ] -\\frac{1}{4}\\hbar^2\\bigl[\\hat{\\lambda}_{p_x}\\hat{\\lambda}_y-\\hat{\\lambda}_x\\hat{\\lambda}_{p_y}\\bigr ] \\end{array}\\ ] ] and they obey the usual algebra @xmath61=i\\hbar \\epsilon_{ijk}\\hat{m}_k$ ] under the kvn commutators ( [ comm ] ) .",
    "all this confirms that it is possible to build the quantum observables @xmath56 by adding to the associated classical ones @xmath33 a suitable combination of kvn operators which vanishes in the classical limit : @xmath62 .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , in classical mechanics the observable energy is given by the operator @xmath37 .",
    "according to the map @xmath35 of ( [ mapq ] ) at the quantum level the energy has instead to be identified with the operator @xmath63 where the classical position @xmath24 and momentum @xmath25 are replaced by the associated bopp operators @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "now at the classical level the energy @xmath37 is a conserved quantity since it commutes with the liouvillian @xmath2 which is the generator of the time evolution : @xmath66=-i\\partial_ah\\omega^{ab } \\partial_bh=0.$ ] what happens at the quantum level ? does the operator @xmath63 still commute with the liouvillian @xmath2 ?",
    "the answer is no .",

    "therefore if we identify the quantum energy with @xmath63 and we require that this quantity has to be conserved in time , then we must consistently change also the operator which generates the time evolution .",
    "in particular in order to compensate the rhs of ( [ notcons ] ) we must add to the liouvillian a term cubic in @xmath70 and in the symplectic matrix : @xmath71 . in fact the commutator of such a term with @xmath63 : @xmath72&= &   \\displaystyle \\frac{\\hbar^2}{8}\\omega^{\\alpha\\beta } \\omega^{a_{\\scriptscriptstyle 1}b_{\\scriptscriptstyle 1 } } \\omega^{a_{\\scriptscriptstyle 2}b_{\\scriptscriptstyle 2 } } ( i\\hat{\\lambda}_{a_{\\scriptscriptstyle 1}}\\hat{\\lambda}_{a_{\\scriptscriptstyle 2 } } \\partial_{\\alpha}\\partial_{b_{\\scriptscriptstyle 1 } } \\partial_{b_{\\scriptscriptstyle 2}}h\\partial_{\\beta}h+\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\hat{\\lambda}_{\\alpha}\\partial_{\\beta } \\partial_{a_{\\scriptscriptstyle 1 } } \\partial_{a_{\\scriptscriptstyle 2}}h\\partial_{b_{\\scriptscriptstyle 1 } } \\partial_{b_{\\scriptscriptstyle 2}}h)+o(\\hbar^3 ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is just the opposite of the rhs of ( [ notcons ] ) .",

    "how can we obtain all this starting from the kvn states and operators ? as we have already seen in the previous sections , since @xmath64 is a linear combination of @xmath24 and @xmath110 , it is more convenient to use , at the kvn hilbert space level , the representation in which @xmath24 and @xmath110 are multiplicative operators while , to satisfy ( [ comm ] ) , @xmath111 and @xmath25 must be given by @xmath112 and @xmath113 respectively . in this representation the hilbert space of the theory",

    "in other words the quantum observables map every vector of @xmath131 in another vector of @xmath131 .",
    "since the function @xmath127 is fixed the space @xmath131 is isomorphic to the usual hilbert space of quantum mechanics : @xmath132 also the kvn scalar product between two different states of @xmath131 , let us say @xmath133 and @xmath134 : @xmath135 induces the standard scalar product of quantum mechanics @xmath136 if the fixed state @xmath137 is normalized according to : @xmath138 .    before going on let us notice that the request of irreducibility is crucial in order to guarantee a one to one correspondence between the states of the theory and the vectors of the space @xmath131 @xcite . in fact let us suppose we consider an arbitrary state belonging to @xmath131 and we replace in it the function @xmath127 with a _ different _ square integrable function @xmath139 .",

    "it is clear that the choice of this invariant subspace is not unique .",
    "for example we could choose the @xmath131 of ( [ aro ] ) in which the wave function @xmath127 is fixed or the subspace latexmath:[\\[{\\bf h}_{\\sigma}=\\biggl\\ { \\psi(q)\\sigma(\\bar{q})\\ ; \\textrm{with } \\",

    "also in this representation if the operators @xmath64 and @xmath65 must act irreducibly on @xmath125 , then we have to identify @xmath125 with the space of all the square integrable functions which depend only on the quantum momenta @xmath147 times a particular @xmath148 . such a space is again isomorphic to the usual quantum hilbert space of the square integrable wave functions in the momentum representation @xmath149 .    before concluding this section we want to stress that it is the  quantization map \" itself @xmath150 of eq .",
    "( [ mapq ] ) which implies that we must change the operator of evolution by replacing the liouvillian @xmath2 with the operator @xmath38 in order to have a conserved quantum energy .",
    "moreover we must reduce the kvn hilbert space to the usual hilbert space of quantum mechanics in order that the positions @xmath64 and the momenta @xmath65 constructed via our map ( [ mapq ] ) form an irreducible set of operators .",
    "so the role of the map ( [ mapq ] ) in this new approach to quantization of classical mechanics is crucial .",
    "in this paper we have shown how to embed quantum mechanics in the kvn hilbert space , which was first introduced to give an operatorial formulation of classical mechanics .",
    "in particular we have proved that the kvn hilbert space turns out to be a suitable mathematical framework for a unifying picture of classical and quantum mechanics : in fact among all the kvn hermitian operators there are both the classical observables @xmath33 and the quantum ones @xmath151 , see the figure below .",
    "[ kkk ]     as a consequence of the choice of the observables in classical mechanics only the moduli of the kvn wave functions @xmath152 are physically significant @xcite while in quantum mechanics , if we impose the condition that @xmath64 and @xmath65 are an irreducible set of operators , the subspace of the physically significant kvn wave functions is isomorphic to the space of the square integrable wave functions @xmath129 or @xmath149 , according to the representation we use .",
    "some ideas of the approach contained in this paper are similar to those of geometric quantization , see for example @xcite . in both cases",
    "the starting point is the kvn hilbert space of square integrable functions on the phase space , in both cases a map is introduced to build the quantum observables and in both cases a sort of polarization is used to reduce the dimension of the quantum hilbert space to the usual one .",
    "however in our approach the recipe to construct the observables is very simple and far from the complicated tools used in geometric quantization . the simple map ( [ mapq ] ) itself suggests in fact the two other ingredients needed to quantize a classical system .",
    "the first one is a well - motivated physical prescription , the conservation of the quantum energy , which implies that the dynamics of the theory has to be modified .",
    "the second ingredient is the mathematical prescription which says that the operators @xmath64 and @xmath65 must act irreducibly and which is necessary to eliminate the redundancy in the physical description of the system . anyway , like in every other approach to quantization also in our case we can not bypass the grenewald - van hove theorem @xcite and an obstruction to a full quantization @xcite of the system still remains . in geometric quantization people construct a very complicated @xmath153-map just to satisfy the relation @xmath154\\ ] ] for every function @xmath45 and @xmath155 but , when they impose the request of irreducibility , the number of observables which can be quantized gets limited . in our approach",
    "the irreducibility prescription reduces the kvn hilbert space to the usual quantum one in a more natural way than in geometric quantization and again this is motivated by the a priori choice of the observables ( [ mapq ] ) that we made .",
    "nevertheless our map ( [ mapq ] ) can not satisfy eq .",
    "( [ kit ] ) for every function @xmath45 and @xmath155 as a simple calculation can show .",
    "therefore the grenewald - van hove theorem is not bypassed by our quantization method .",
    "the last point we want to mention is that having a unique big hilbert space for both classical and quantum mechanics can help in studying and appreciating the similarities and differences between the two theories . in particular , for what concerns the observables we must note , see * fig . 1 *",
    ", that within the kvn theory there is enough space to describe both classical and quantum mechanics but there is further space available for further observables which could describe some other possible regimes , like the ones at the border between classical and quantum mechanics @xcite or the models of dynamical reduction @xcite .",
