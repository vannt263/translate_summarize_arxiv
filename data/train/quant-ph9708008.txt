    "in recent years advances in the cooling and trapping of ions have led to a situation in which the centre - of - mass ( cm ) motion of trapped ions has to be treated quantum mechanically @xcite .",

    "systems of trapped ions have been employed to demonstrate experimentally the generation and measurement of non - classical states of the ion s cm motion @xcite .",

    "@xcite considered the generation of particular two - mode states of an ion . in this paper",
    "we address the issue of how to engineer a class of interactions between two of the quantized motional degrees of freedom of a single trapped ion .",
    "we assume that the ion is confined within a trap potential that can be closely approximated by a two - dimensional harmonic well . in this case",
    "the cm motion of the ion is completely equivalent to that of a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator , characterized by two frequencies of oscillation @xmath3 and @xmath4 in orthogonal directions @xmath0 and @xmath5 and the corresponding operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 create ( annihilate ) vibrational excitations in the @xmath0- and @xmath1-directions .",
    "the interaction that we want to engineer is of the parametric form @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are positive integers and @xmath11 is a complex coupling constant .",
    "in particular , we note that the powers @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be independently controlled to take on any positive integer numbers , and the phase of the coupling constant @xmath14 is freely adjustable . to give specific examples of this class of interactions between the two vibrational modes @xmath15 and @xmath16 we address the two coupling hamiltonians , @xmath17 the hamiltonian ( [ 6 ] ) generates an active rotation of the two - dimensional quantized motional state of the ion at a frequency @xmath14 where @xmath11 is real .",
    "here @xmath18 is the kind of hamiltonian associated with a linear coupler or beam splitter in optics ( see e.g.  @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) . there , a photon in mode @xmath15 is annihilated and a photon in mode @xmath19 is created , and vice versa . in a trapped ion , vibrational anticorrelated su(2 ) states of motion characteristic of this kind of linear coupling can be generated @xcite .",
    "the linear coupling , @xmath20 makes it possible to transfer the motional state of the ion from , say the @xmath0-direction into the @xmath1-direction _ without prior knowledge _ of that motional state and irrespective of whether it is a pure or a mixed state .",
    "in the situation in which one may want to use the quantized motion in the @xmath0-direction for quantum computation @xcite , perhaps later entangling the quantum state of motion with internal electronic states , the @xmath1-direction can then be employed as a quantum memory element .",
    "note the key point here is that states of motion in the @xmath0-direction can be transferred entirely to the @xmath1-direction without reading out their nature , entirely non - destructively .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath21 is of the three - photon down - conversion kind : in optics , it represents a process in which one pump photon in mode @xmath19 is annihilated and three photons in mode @xmath15 are created , and vice versa .",
    "this process is known to be highly peculiar : unlike its two - photon down - conversion cousin , quantization of the pump is essential to avoid pathological divergences @xcite .",
    "these are avoided in a fully quantized treatment , where the pump and down - converted field modes become highly entangled @xcite .    in section [ generalraman ]",
    ", we first introduce a two - mode raman transition which couples the electronic and motional degrees of freedom of the ion . choosing the initial state of the ion to be a direct product of an arbitrary motional state and a specific electronic state",
    ", we then decouple the electronic and motional dynamics of the ion through a particular configuration of laser beams ( section [ specificcoupling ] ) . in the lamb - dicke approximation and in the limit of suitable trap anisotropy",
    "we obtain the above hamiltonian ( [ 5 ] ) for various sideband detunings of the lasers .",
    "we then examine the severity of the approximations made to obtain the hamiltonian ( [ 5 ] ) . in section",
    "[ limits ] we obtain analytical estimates regarding the effects of off - resonant and higher on - resonant processes . in section [ rotation ]",
    "we specialize to the case @xmath22 and show that the hamiltonian @xmath18 rotates the motional quantum state of the ion .",
    "finally , we perform a numerical analysis of the complete quantum dynamics and find that the hamiltonian ( [ 6 ] ) can be accurately engineered over a range of parameters .",
    "in the following we describe the raman coupling which we use to engineer the hamiltonian given in ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "we consider an effective three - level ion in a @xmath23-configuration , confined within a two - dimensional harmonic trap as illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the trap is characterized by the two frequencies @xmath3 and @xmath24 which describe the harmonic potential in @xmath0- and @xmath1-direction respectively .",
    "as shown in fig.[fig1 ] , the ion is excited by two linearly polarized laser beams which propagate in the @xmath0- and @xmath1-directions connecting levels @xmath25 and @xmath26 these beams are far detuned from the excited state @xmath27 in order to generate a stimulated raman transition between the two states @xmath28 and @xmath29 we assume states @xmath28 and @xmath30 to be ground state hyperfine sublevels .",
    "we do not include decoherence effects in our model for the following reason .",
    "the raman coupled energy level scheme greatly suppresses the spontaneous emission between the two ground state levels @xmath31 and @xmath32 as these states are coupled by m1 and e2 transitions at best . at the same time",
    "we neglect the effects of spontaneous emission from level @xmath33 as the coupling to the excited state can be effectively eliminated over the timescales of interest to us here when the laser beams are far detuned .",
    "another source of decoherence in ion trap experiments is classical noise in the laser beams and trapping potential .",
    "this may be described using so - called intrinsic decoherence models , e.g.  @xcite , of dephasing .",
    "the effects of this kind of decoherence have been seen in a recent experiment by meekhof et .",
    "al .  @xcite .",

    "however , this may not be the case when engineering higher order interactions .",
    "one can shorten the interaction time by increasing the laser power while maintaining inequality ( [ 30 ] ) by increasing the detunings @xmath281 and @xmath282 the fundamental limit is then given by the detunings that one can realize and the accessible laser power .",
    "in this work we showed how one can engineer a class of hamiltonians for the motional dynamics of an ultra - cold ion in a harmonic trap .",
    "the process uses a stimulated raman transition in a @xmath283-configuration with the two lasers propagating along the @xmath0- and @xmath1-directions . to decouple the internal electronic dynamics from the external motional dynamics we constructed a hamiltonian in which these evolutions factored .",
    "this was done through the addition of a second pair of lasers which generated the symmetric counter - part to the hamiltonian generated by the first pair of lasers . by preparing the electronic states in a particular superposition , the internal and external dynamics completely separated and we could treat the motional dynamics alone . in the lamb - dicke limit and with suitable sideband detunings ,",
    "we could `` target '' a particular term to be of leading order in the hamiltonian .",
    "however , we found that besides the term we wanted to dominate , other , higher on - resonant terms appeared .",
    "we could manipulate the strengths of the couplings to these unwanted terms by altering the trap frequency ratio and found that we could neglect these unwanted terms in the lamb - dicke approximation for large enough trap anisotropies . finally , we did a numerical evaluation of the full hamiltonian as a check on the analytical estimates .",
    "although we have primarily concentrated on the linear rotation hamiltonian ( [ 6 ] ) , higher order dynamics can be generated i.e.  @xmath284 given by eq.([7 ] ) .",
    "the nonlinear hamiltonian @xmath285 has been much studied in the quantum optical literature as a model of nonlinearly - coupled field modes @xcite .",
    "we know from this work that such hamiltonians generate a rich nonlinear dynamical structure reflecting the strong mode entanglement characteristic of those couplings .",
    "their optical realization is difficult , but may well be more straightforward in trapped ion dynamics , as resonances can then be used to isolate chosen nonlinearities .    finally , we note the recent publication of two papers @xcite which examine types of non - linear interaction hamiltonians in the motion of trapped ions which are closely related to the work presented here .",
