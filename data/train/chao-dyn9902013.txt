    "dynamical systems written by differential equations are useful to understand temporal evolutions of the nature .",
    "exact solutions to the equations are not always obtained because of non - integrability of systems , and naive perturbation often yields secular terms which prevent us from getting approximate but global solutions .",
    "singular perturbation techniques  @xcite , eg averaging methods , multi scale methods , matched asymptotic expansions and wkb methods , are available to construct global solutions .",
    "however , they provide no systematic procedures for general systems because we must select a suitable assumption about the structure of a perturbation series .",
    "recently , renormalization group method is proposed  @xcite as a tool for global asymptotic analysis of the solutions to differential equations .",
    "it unifies the techniques listed above , and can treat many systems irrespective of their features .",
    "we apply the renormalization group method to hamiltonian systems , and compare it with canonical perturbation theory  @xcite , which is one of the most developed perturbation theory for hamiltonian systems . in this letter , we show that the renormalization group method also unifies the canonical perturbation theory .",
    "that is , the former and the latter give the same solutions to equations of motion up to the second order of a small parameter .",
    "we use action - angle coordinates as they are suitable for perturbed hamiltonian systems , and hamiltonians are @xmath0 where both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are @xmath3-dimensional vectors , the integrable part @xmath4 is @xmath5 and @xmath6 is periodic with respect to each element of @xmath2 .",
    "we derive an approximate solution with naive perturbation in section [ sec : naive - sol ] , and then we renormalize secular terms to constants of integration in section [ sec : renormalization ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : cp ] we compare the renormalized solutions with solutions obtained by canonical perturbation theory .",
    "the equation of motion for the system ( [ eq : model ] ) is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a @xmath9-dimensional vector and the symbol @xmath10 is poisson bracket with respect to the subscript , in this case , @xmath11 .",
    "we expand @xmath11 as a series of powers of @xmath12 , @xmath13 and then equation ( [ eq : eom ] ) becomes @xmath14 where , in the right - hand - side , we substitute @xmath15 to @xmath11 after the poisson bracket has been operated .",
    "the solution to @xmath16 is @xmath17 where @xmath3-dimensional vectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 are constants of integration .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath20 is @xmath21 and hence the solution to @xmath20 is @xmath22 where we introduced the symbols @xmath23 @xmath24 represents average over @xmath25 , and @xmath26 the following relation was also used @xmath27 which is satisfied by arbitrary functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 that are periodic for @xmath2 and @xmath30 .    the equation to @xmath31 is @xmath32 and the solution to @xmath31 is @xmath33 here @xmath34 and @xmath35 which are proven by using fourier expressions of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the concrete forms of the fourier expressions , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are shown in appendix .",
    "consequently , the naive solution to equation ( [ eq : eom ] ) is , up to @xmath31 , @xmath40 \\\\      & \\hspace*{1em } + t~      \\left [        { \\epsilon}{\\left\\ { \\bchi ~,~ { \\left < h_{1 } \\right>_{t } } \\right\\}_{\\bchi } }        + { \\epsilon}^{2 } { \\left\\ { \\bchi ~,~ { \\left < f_{2 } \\right>_{t } } \\right\\}_{\\bchi } }        \\right ] \\\\      & \\hspace*{1em } + { \\epsilon}^{2 } \\left [      ( t^{2 } \\mbox{-secular terms } )      + ( t \\mbox{-secular terms with non - constants } )       \\right ] .      } \\ ] ]",
    "we renormalize the secular terms of the naive solution ( [ eq : naive - sol ] ) to the constants of integration .",

    ", @xmath49-secular terms and @xmath25-secular terms with non - constants in @xmath31 of equation ( [ eq : naive - sol ] ) are renormalized to coefficients of @xmath25-secular terms and coefficients of non - constant terms , respectively .",
    "finally we compare the renormalized solution ( [ eq : renormalized - sol ] ) and solution obtained by canonical perturbation theory .",
    "the strategy of the theory is to canonically transform coordinates @xmath8 to @xmath50 with the generator @xmath51 @xmath52 such that secular terms do not appear in the coordinates @xmath53 .",
    "what we must calculate are the generator @xmath54 and the transformed hamiltonian @xmath55 .",
    "canonical perturbation theory  @xcite states that the required generator @xmath56 is expressed as @xmath57 and the transformed hamiltonian @xmath58 as @xmath59 where @xmath60 the symbol @xmath61 represents the average over @xmath62 , the time of @xmath53 following @xmath63 , that is , @xmath64 consequently , this theory gives an approximate solution determined by @xmath65 and the canonical transformation ( [ eq : bxtobxs ] ) @xmath66 + { o(\\epsilon^{3 } ) } .\\ ] ] the approximate solution ( [ eq : cano - trans ] ) is the same as the renormalized solution ( [ eq : renormalized - sol ] ) since temporal evolutions of @xmath53 and @xmath48 are governed by equations ( [ eq : moe - xs ] ) and ( [ eq : rge ] ) respectively , and the two equations have the same structure .",
    "we showed that renormalization group method gives the same approximate solutions as canonical perturbation theory up to the second order of a small parameter to the hamiltonian systems whose integrable parts linearly depend on action variables .",
    "that is , renormalization group method unifies not only averaging methods , multi scale methods , matched asymptotic expansions and wkb methods , but canonical perturbation theory .",
    "we suppose that the unification holds even in higher orders of the small parameter .    in systems whose integrable parts are not linear , secular terms are not always proportional to time @xmath25 , and may be proportional to @xmath67 .",
    "canonical perturbation theory can not remove the latter secular terms since subtracting time - averages of perturbative part of hamiltonian is effective only for the @xmath25-linear secular terms . on the contrary ,",
    "renormalization group method gives global solutions by introducing assumptions with which renormalization transformations become to a lie group  @xcite and can treat @xmath68 type secular terms .    in the previous paper  @xcite , we discussed relation between integrability of original systems and symplectic properties of renormalization group equations in cartesian coordinates . from equation ( [ eq : rge ] ) , we clarified that renormalization group equations are always hamiltonian systems in action - angle coordinates whose hamiltonian is @xmath69 symplectic properties are recovered even in cartesian coordinates by using `` gauge freedom '' which is homogeneous terms of @xmath20",
