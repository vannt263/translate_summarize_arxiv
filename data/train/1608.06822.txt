    "<S> based on these two degrees of freedom we construct a bipartite two - level quantum system of the accretion disk s photons . to characterize the quantum states of this system we consider linear entropy for the reduced density matrix of polarization with the intention to exploit its direct relation with the photons degree of polarization . since the x - ray radiation has a minimum degree of polarization located at the transition region of the accretion disk , the linear entropy is higher for the photons emitted on this region inferring a higher degree of entanglement for the composite system . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that for an extreme rotating black hole in the thermal state , the photons with energies at the thermal peak are maximally entangled in polarization and orbital angular momentum , leading to the creation of all four bell states . </S>",
    "<S> detection of the bell states encoded by x - ray photons emitted nearby rotating black holes should be possible by equipment actually used in quantum information processing .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section ] ]    rotating black holes ( rbh ) are among the most mysterious predictions general relativity has made . </S>",
    "<S> spinning black holes are literally dragging and twisting the space - time nearby influencing the photons emitted by the accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> the strong gravitational field in the vicinity of spinning bh rotates the angle of polarization and imprint orbital angular momentum to x - ray photons emitted by accretion disk .    </S>",
    "<S> the efforts to determine the characteristics of these remarkable astrophysical bodies were mainly focused in the recent years over detecting the polarization of x - ray radiation coming from the accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> it was pointed out in [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] based on stokes parameters calculation , that photons emitted by the accretion disk of black holes in the thermal state , should possess linear polarization , either parallel or perpendicular to the plane of the disk .    on the outer region of the disk , at low energies </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray radiation is horizontally polarized parallel to the plane of the disk . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization angle of photons coming from the innermost region is shifted through vertical polarization , perpendicular to the disk plane due to the strong gravitational field in the vicinity of the rbh.in this region , at high energies the x - ray photons are vertically polarized . </S>",
    "<S> the degree of polarization is maximal in these two regions of the accretion disk . between the outer and inner regions of the disk , at the transition region the relative contributions of horizontal and vertical polarized photons are nearly equal and no net polarization </S>",
    "<S> is observed . </S>",
    "<S> the transition region is characterized by very low degrees of polarization that tends to zero for near - extreme spinning black holes .    on the other hand , numerical simulations [ 10 ] , </S>",
    "<S> [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] suggest that strong dragging frame effect near rotating black holes imprint nontrivial orbital angular momentum ( oam ) modes to photons emitted by the accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray photons coming from the disk are forced by the twisted spacetime around spinning black hole to acquire oam . </S>",
    "<S> as the bh spins faster the oam modes spectrum extend to wider values carrying both positive and negative oam values ( @xmath0 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> when measured by a distant observer , the x - ray radiation coming from accretion disk should carry linear polarization ( horizontal or vertical ) and specific ( positive or negative ) oam values as a consequence of spacetime shape modeled by the presence of rotating black hole .    to completely determine the states of photons emitted near rotating black holes we consider the density matrix [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] of the composite system consisting of the two degrees of freedom - polarization and oam  which form hermitian and orthogonal two - level subsystems .    to simplify further the analysis of this bipartite system consisting of two - level subsystems , polarization and oam , we use the reduced density matrix of photons polarization having in mind to exploit its direct relation with the photon degree of polarization via the linear entropy . </S>",
    "<S> our main assumption here is that the degree of mixed - ness of the polarization subsystem determines the degree of entanglement of the composite system , polarization - oam as in [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the high mixed - ness of the subsystem suggests a strong non - separability ( entanglement ) of the composite system .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider linear entropy of the x - ray photons polarization in order to shed light on the degree of mixedness in this subsystem . </S>",
    "<S> broadly , the low degree of polarization of x - ray radiation on the transition region of the accretion disk is an indication of high values of linear polarization and so a high degree of mixed - ness at the subsystem level ; an expected result since on the transition region both horizontal and vertical polarized photons are present . </S>",
    "<S> from here we conclude that x - ray photons emitted by accretion disk possess a certain degree of entanglement in polarization and oam modes .    </S>",
    "<S> the outer and innermost regions of rotating black hole accretion disk emit photons closer to pure state , due to the strong horizontal and , respectively vertical polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray photons emitted on the transition region are in mixed states which suggest entangled to a certain degree that depends on bh spin . </S>",
    "<S> the faster the bh spins the higher de degree of entanglement of x - ray photons in polarization and oam .    </S>",

    "<S> the maximal entanglement in polarization and oam of x - ray photons coming from the transition region of the accretion disk is expressed via schmidt decomposition [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] by the all four bell states .    </S>",
    "<S> the bell states of x - ray photons can be measured by simple quantum optics set ups [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] with the limitation imposed here by the high energy of photons ( x - ray band ) . with the later progress in technology related to x - ray laboratory research [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] leading to quantum computation with x - ray photons [ 22 ] </S>",
    "<S> legitimate hopes are directed towards detection and measurements of the bell states the x - ray radiation coming from galactic active nuclei and solar - mass black holes accretion disk .    </S>",
    "<S> detection of bell states is an important indication on the possibility that strong gravitational field near rotating black holes to literally implement complex quantum information processes encoded in the x - ray photons emitted by accretion disk .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-1 ] ]    expectations to unveil some of the black holes hidden characteristics , such as the speed of spinning , are related to measuring the polarization of x - ray photons emitted by the accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> polarization of radiation emitted by accretion disk in thermal state is analyzed in [ 1 ] [ 2 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] considering the simplest model of a geometrically thin , optically thick , steady - state accretion disk , aligned with the bh spin axis .    </S>",
    "<S> stokes parameters are central in attempts [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] to estimate the degree of polarization and the polarization angle of x - ray radiation emitted by accretion disk near rbh :    @xmath2    @xmath3    @xmath4    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the polarization angle .    </S>",
    "<S> angle of polarization and degree of polarization , the two parameters of interest that quote the characteristics of black hole are derived from the stokes parameter in the following manner :    @xmath7    @xmath8    we consider here only the linear polarization since the polarization is induced by compton scattering . </S>",
    "<S> these two parameters are sensitive to the black hole spin ( a ) and the inclination angle ( i ) of the accretion disk in relation with a distant observer that detect x - ray photons coming from the accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> the angle of inclination is not relevant here and will be assigned to a constant value @xmath9 ; only the spin parameter of the black hole is inferred further .    </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations results , considering different spin parameters ( a ) are resumed in the figure 1 , where the degree of polarization of x - ray radiation is depicted in left panel and the angle of polarization in the right image .     </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> polarization degree ( left ) and polarization angle for x - ray photons emitted by accretion disk of bh with different spin parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> it can be noted from the left image in the figure 1 that x - rays emitted near the outer region of the accretion disk , at low energies , are polarized parallel to the plane of the disk , horizontal polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the strong gravitational field close to the black hole rotates the polarization angle of the x - ray photons emitted by the innermost regions of the disk to positive or negative values perpendicular to the plane of the disk ; vertical polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the rotation of polarization angle is greater for rapidly spinning black holes where accretion disk moves closer to the horizon .    at the transition region of the accretion disk situated between low energies and high energies of x - ray radiation , </S>",
    "<S> both horizontal and vertical polarization photons are present canceling each other contribution , phenomenon reflected in a minimum peak of the degree of polarization . </S>",
    "<S> it can be noted from the figure 1 ( left ) that for near - extreme rotating black holes ( @xmath10 ) the degree of polarization of photons at the peak energies emitted in the transition regions goes to a minimum that almost approach zero value ( @xmath11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is an important result which will play a crucial role in what follows .    unlike radio or optical telescopes , which measure the intensity of the radiation from the source , </S>",
    "<S> most x - ray telescopes detect individual photons . using the additivity of stokes parameters and counting a large number of photons </S>",
    "<S> the above results are recovered . </S>",
    "<S> since the number of x - ray photons is small we desire to extract as much information as is physically possible from every photon .    </S>",
    "<S> stokes parameters could be inferred to construct the polarization coherency matrix of the photons emitted near rotating black holes , a less considered approach [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] which unitary contain all physical information about the polarization state of radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization coherency matrix is given by :    @xmath12    replacing the values of stokes parameters from the equations ( 1 ) , polarization matrix takes the form :    @xmath13    only linear polarization of x - ray radiation coming from the accretion disk is retain further since the comptonization of radiation scattered from the disk prevent the circular polarization . taking @xmath14 and by straightforward calculations </S>",
    "<S> the coherency matrix could be written as :    @xmath15    the coherency polarization matrix equals the density matrix of the photons source [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] since density matrix is the unit trace scaling of the polarization matrix and @xmath16 , such as for the rest of the present paper we will refer to @xmath17 as the density matrix of polarization of x - ray photons .    </S>",
    "<S> the density matrix corresponds to the general quantum state of x - ray photons emitted by the accretion disk near the rotating black hole :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are horizontal and respectively vertical polarization .    </S>",
    "<S> considering that only linear polarization horizontal ( @xmath19 ) and vertical ( @xmath20 ) to the plane of the accretion disk is measured the density matrix reduces to :    @xmath21    the matrix ( 7 ) is the diagonalized two dimensional hermitian ( @xmath22 ) density matrix of the two - level orthogonal system of x - ray photons polarization , considered in the basis @xmath23 as the degree of freedom .    </S>",
    "<S> the states of the x - ray photons are parts of the hermitian space of polarization @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> based on the density matrix representation , we can now characterize the state of the x - ray photons emitted near the outside region of accretion disk , horizontally ( h ) polarized , the density matrix is @xmath25 , while the @xmath26 .    at the transition region </S>",

    "<S> independent azimuthal phase term @xmath28 possesses an orbital angular momentum of @xmath29 per photon , where @xmath29 is the integer topological charge .    </S>",
    "<S> the oam values @xmath29 that the frame dragging effect nearby spinning black holes imprint to x - ray radiation emitted by accretion disk are determined by bh spin and the inclination angle of the disk towards a remote observer . </S>",
    "<S> we maintain for the inclination angle the same value @xmath9 as discussed in the case of x - ray polarization and analyze further the only the bh spin parameter influences on the x - ray radiation coming from the accretion disk .    </S>",
    "<S> the figure 2 depicts the maps of oam modes acquired by x - ray photons emitted near rbh having two different values for the spin parameter , a relatively slow spinning bh ( @xmath30 ) to the left and a near - extreme rotating bh ( @xmath31 ) to the right , captured from [ 10 ] .     </S>",

    "<S> notice from figure 2 that the slow spinning bh is characterized by a narrow spectrum of oam that reduces only to zero lg mode ( @xmath32 ) for schwartzchild bh ( @xmath33 ) , which is still the predominant value for spin parameter @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> a rapidly spinning black hole ( @xmath31 ) has the innermost region of the accretion disk closer to the black hole event horizon . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray photons emitted by the accretion disk are influenced stronger by the gravitational field because of the bh proximal vicinity and tends to flip toward wider oam modes . </S>",
    "<S> as it can be noticed from figure 2 ( right ) the near - extreme spinning black hole has a broader oam spectrum with a significant reduction of zero lg modes .    </S>",
    "<S> we are interested here of another remarkable aspect that reside from the oam maps above ; as can be inferred from figure 2 , x - ray photons emitted near the rbh acquire both negative and positive oam values . </S>",
    "<S> considering the oam modes , the state of x - ray photons can be expressed as a combination of positive and negative oam modes , @xmath34 and @xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> the generic x - ray photon emitted nearby rbh acquires not only a definite polarization ( horizontal or vertical ) but also a definite value of oam ( @xmath35 ) . </S>",

    "<S> for now we will consider generic oam ( @xmath35 ) having in mind a specific value of x - ray photons oam . to consistently specify the state of x - ray photons emitted by the accretion disk both of the two degrees of freedom must be considered . </S>",

    "<S> oam has the general form :    @xmath43    with @xmath44    [ [ section-3 ] ]    a good measure to characterize the state of the accretion disk photons having acquired the two degrees of freedom ( polarization and oam ) is the linear entropy of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the linear entropy expresses the degree of mixedness of the system and is related to the density matrix through the relation :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the dimension of the hilbert space of the system , here @xmath47 for the x - ray photons with two degrees of freedom , and @xmath48 stands for the trace of the density matrix of the composite system .    </S>",

    "<S> the faster block hole is spinning the lower the degree of polarization at the thermal peak . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that at the thermal peak the linear entropy is closer to the maximum value , @xmath57 , which induces a state of maximum mixedness in the polarization of photons at the transition region of the accretion disk .    </S>",
