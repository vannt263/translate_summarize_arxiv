    "nowadays , it is widely recognized that grbs have cosmological origin , as suggested by beppo - sax observations @xcite of counterparts in the x - ray band of some grbs .",
    "thanks to these observations , it has been also possible to determine with great accuracy the grb position and consequently , through pointing of optical and radio telescopes , to evaluate the distance of some grbs . the derived amount of energy radiated by assuming an isotropic explosion can result in some cases of the order of @xmath1 erg in the soft @xmath0-ray ( 50 - 300 kev ) energy band , showing that in a grb event up to one solar mass can be radiated in form of soft @xmath0-rays . note that if grbs are beamed sources as indicated by afterglow observations @xcite , the emitted energy would be decreased by the factor @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the beaming angle .    according to the fireball model for grbs @xcite ,",
    "relativistic electrons are accelerated at shock fronts occurring near the interface of the expanding relativistic shells ( external shock models ) , or at shocks forming within the unsteady outflow itself ( internal shock models ) .",
    "soft @xmath0-rays are then produced through leptonic processes , such as synchrotron or inverse compton emission .",
    "many grbs have been recognized as high - energy @xmath0-rays emitters by the egret experiment which detected @xmath0-rays in the energy band between 30 mev and 20 gev from a high percentage of the bright bursts found by batse @xcite .",
    "these observations clearly show that the grb phenomenon is not exclusively the domain of soft - energy leptonic processes but may include high - energy hadronic mechanisms .",
    "+ it has been suggested ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that highly relativistic protons accelerated at shock front can produce quite efficiently very high - energy photons and neutrinos through @xmath4 interactions within the dense photon field arising from the grb @xcite , or by mutual @xmath5 interactions in the ejecta @xcite , or by @xmath6 inelastic collisions with neutrons , if present in the original explosion @xcite .",
    "+ the emission of high - energy neutrinos and @xmath0-rays has been also investigated within the so - called cannonball scenario , by which jets of highly relativistic balls emitted in supernovae explosions collide with the surrounding shell producing quasi thermal radiation ( due to the collision heating ) , and high energy @xmath0-rays and neutrinos ( through @xmath5 interaction in the shell ) @xcite    very recently , a model for the production of high - energy @xmath0-rays in grbs with @xmath7 gev has been proposed  @xcite : high - energy protons emerging from the grb source may subsequently interact with external nucleons , giving rise to neutral pions , which in turn promptly decay into high - energy photons . a key requirement of the model is the existence of a dense enough cloud ( as a target for @xmath8 interactions ) , which surrounds the grb source , or , alternatively , situated along the line of sigh to the observer and near enough the source . a delay in the arrival times of the high - energy @xmath0-rays with respect to the soft @xmath0-rays and a temporal spread of the signal at earth is predicted as a consequence of the proton deflection due to the presence of magnetic fields in the region surrounding the grb source . clearly , in addition to neutral pion production , inelastic @xmath8 collisions also produce charged pions , kaons and small quantities of other mesons . if their main free path for interaction @xmath9 , is much larger than their decay path @xmath10 ( with @xmath11 ) , they decay into charged leptons and neutrinos @xcite .",
    "@xmath12 , the condition @xmath13 is well verified , so that all the produced secondary unstable mesons decay before interacting with the cloud itself . ] here @xmath14 is the nucleon number density , @xmath15 is the pion - nucleon cross section and @xmath16 is the pion proper mean life .",
    "the description of this model is given with some detail in section 2 .",
    "in section 3 , we estimate the neutrino emission from grbs as expected within this frame and compare our results with the theoretical predictions by other models for the production of neutrinos from astrophysical sources . in section 4",
    "we finally discuss the detectability of the expected signal in terms of upward - going neutrino - induced muons by taking into account the experimental constrains given by underground and underwater / ice detectors .",
    "according to  @xcite , we assume that the grb source emits an amount of energy @xmath17 erg in form of relativistic protons  @xcite , released at a distance @xmath18 cm from the central source , during a time @xmath19 s.    moreover , we require that there exists a dense enough cloud near / around the grb source ( with @xmath20 @xmath12 ) so that accelerated protons subsequently interact with the nucleons in the cloud ( @xmath21 @xmath22 ) , giving rise to neutral and charged pions and ultimately to high - energy photons and neutrinos .. correspondingly , the mass enclosed will be @xmath23 in a shell - like cloud geometry around the grb and @xmath24 in the case of an intervening cloud near the grb source . ]",
    "as far as the value of the energy spectral index @xmath37 is concerned , since protons are accelerated by shock waves moving with ultra - relativistic velocities ( corresponding to grb lorentz factor @xmath38 , see e. g. @xcite and diffusive processes are negligible during the time before @xmath8 interactions , we adopt the relevant value @xmath39 @xcite .    finally , the constant @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ eqno : pflux ] ) , results from the normalization condition @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the minimum proton energy .    following dermer @xcite , the production spectrum of high - energy @xmath0-rays resulting from @xmath8 collisions , via @xmath43 decay , is given by the source function @xmath44~ , \\label{eqno : qgamma } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the angle between the line of sight and the proton direction , asterisks refer to cm frame and @xmath46 is the lorentz invariant cross - section for @xmath47 production in high - energy ( @xmath48 gev ) @xmath8 collisions .",
    "gev of the invariant cross - section used by dermer @xcite is in reasonable agreement with monte carlo simulations by several @xmath8 event generators . ]",
    "numerical values of @xmath49 depend on the main model parameters , namely the grb energetics @xmath50 , the nucleon number density @xmath14 and the magnetic field strength @xmath51 ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "an important effect of the presence of magnetic fields is a temporal spread of the emitted high - energy @xmath0-ray signal on earth . to better analyze this point",
    ", we can consider the proton injection as instantaneous , since the acceleration time @xmath52 s is much smaller than the average proton interaction time @xmath53 .",
    "accordingly , denoting by @xmath54 the instant at which photons arrive on earth in the case @xmath55 ( no proton deflection ) , the delay @xmath56 can be expressed as a function of the radial coordinate @xmath57 at which @xmath8 interactions occur and the proton larmor radius @xmath58 : @xmath59 vice versa , one can say that photons which arrive on earth within the time window ( @xmath54,@xmath60 ) are produced by protons of energy @xmath26 only if these protons have interacted with nucleons in the shell between @xmath33 and @xmath61 .      from fig . 1 , one can see that for a given photon energy @xmath69 the differential @xmath0-ray production increases with increasing @xmath14 and decreasing @xmath51 .",
    "the effect is particularly important at low @xmath69 values .",
    "in fact , low - energy photons are mainly generated by low - energy protons with @xmath26 roughly one order of magnitude above @xmath69 : they are more easily deflected by the intervening magnetic fields giving rise to photons that can not reach the observer since @xmath70 .",
    "however , our numerical results show that in a large range of values for @xmath14 and @xmath51 , the decrease of @xmath62 for increasing values of @xmath51 can be counterbalanced by increasing @xmath14 . moreover , for each assumed value of @xmath51 , there exists a limiting density ( @xmath71 @xmath12 in the case @xmath72 g ) above which most of the protons interact before suffer substantial deflection .",
    "note that in deriving eq .",
    "( [ eqno : lum ] ) we have neglected re - absorption of the produced @xmath0-rays in the cloud itself .-",
    "rays may in principle be re - absorbed through the interactions with the atomic hydrogen , provided that the path they have to travel inside the cloud ( after being produced ) is long enough .",
    "however , clouds nearby the grb source are expected to present a high ionization degree , so that the relevant absorption processes are @xmath73 and @xmath74 interactions , which imply a large @xmath0 free - path before re - absorption . ] clearly , re - absorption of neutrinos within the cloud itself can be completely neglected .",
    "starting from the neutrino fluence @xmath90 during the time interval @xmath91 , one can estimate an average neutrino flux on earth from a single source as follows : @xmath92 otherwise , it is also possible that neutrinos from unresolved grbs sources give a contribution to the diffuse high energy neutrino background . in this respect , due to",
    "the widely accepted cosmological origin of grbs , we adopted , as recently done in @xcite , the cosmological evolution scheme developed by schmidt @xcite .",
    "in particular , we assume that the rate of grb events , per unit comoving volume and per unit comoving time , is given by @xmath93 with @xmath94 and @xmath95 . the parameter @xmath96",
    "is then determined so that the observed ( in the soft @xmath0-ray band ) total grb event rate @xmath97 reads @xmath98 yr@xmath85 . here",
    ", @xmath99 is the comoving volume element , @xmath100 is the proper motion distance , related to the luminosity distance @xmath101 given in eq .",
    "( [ eqno : dl ] ) , @xmath102 is taken equal 5 . moreover , in eq .",
    "( [ eqno : rate ] ) we also take into account that the time interval between bursts is stretched by the factor @xmath103 .    for simplicity , we assume that grbs are standard candles , each source with @xmath88 erg / sr , @xmath104 g and @xmath105 @xmath12 .",
    "correspondingly , the diffuse neutrino flux expected on earth results to be @xmath106 } { 4 \\pi d_l^2(z ) } ~ \\frac{\\dot{n}(z)}{1+z } \\frac{dv}{dz}~dz\\ ] ]    in fig .  [ fondo ] , @xmath107 is given as a function of @xmath108 .",
    "for comparison we show the diffuse neutrino flux from grb events ( via @xmath4 interactions ) predicted by the waxman & bahcall model @xcite as well as the upper bound implied by high energy cosmic ray observations estimated by the same authors  @xcite . moreover , in fig .",
    "[ fondo ] , we give the atmospheric neutrino flux averaged on the zenith angle as calculated by gaisser et al .",
    "@xcite . actually , at energy above 10 tev , the isotropic contribution of neutrinos produced in the atmosphere by the semileptonic decays of charmed hadrons ( prompt neutrinos ) , starts to dominate over the conventional pion and kaon decay induced atmospheric neutrino flux . in fig .",
    "[ fondo ] we report the contribution of prompt neutrinos as calculated in @xcite within the frame of the recombination quark parton model .",
    "it should be remarked that there is some theoretical uncertainty on the calculation of prompt neutrinos flux , as well as on the energy at which this contribution crosses over the conventional atmospheric flux . in fig .",
    "[ fondo ] , we considered one of the highest prediction among those given in @xcite . finally , the upper limits from current experiments ( frejus @xcite , amanda @xcite and baikal @xcite ) are shown , derived by assuming a power law spectrum ( @xmath109 ) an initial neutrino flux .",
    "high - energy neutrinos from astrophysical sources can be detected by collecting the upward - going neutrino - induced muons produced through charge - current interactions with the matter surrounding the detector .",
    "based upon this detection principle , current underground and underwater / ice experiments are surveying the sky in order to search for neutrino sources . in the frame of the model described above , we have investigated by numerical calculation",
    "the detectability of the signal expected either from a single point - like grb , or from the diffuse flux due to unresolved grbs .",
    "neutrino propagation through the earth has been developed following the approach discussed in  @xcite , where they give an analytical method for the precise calculation of the spectrum of high energy neutrinos propagating through a dense medium of any thickness , for initial spectrum and for cross sections of any form .",
    "+ as a preliminary observation , it should be noticed that the results of atmospheric neutrino experiments  @xcite suggest that muon neutrinos can oscillate into tau neutrinos , thus affecting the expected muon event rate on the detector .",
    "this effect has been extensively discussed e.g. in @xcite . here , flavour oscillation will be not considered .",
    "+ at energy above 1 gev neutrino - matter interaction is dominated by the process of _ deep inelastic scattering _ ( dis ) on nucleons ( charge and neutral current processes ) , since the contributions of both elastic and quasi - elastic interactions become negligible .",
    "the main difficulty for the evaluation of the deep inelastic neutrino - nucleon cross sections arises from the fact that , in spite of the lack of experimental data , at very high energy the details of nucleon structure become important .",
