    "observing @xmath8 decay would tell us that the total lepton number is not a conserved quantity , and that neutrinos are massive majorana fermions .",
    "answering these questions is obviously a crucial part of the search for the `` physics beyond the standard model '' .",
    "consequently , experimental searches for the @xmath8 decay , of ever increasing sensitivity , are pursued worldwide ( for a recent review of the field , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , interpreting existing results as a determination of the neutrino effective mass , and planning new experiments , is impossible without the knowledge of the corresponding nuclear matrix elements .",
    "their determination , and a realistic estimate of their uncertainty , are therefore an integral part of the problem .",
    "the nuclear matrix elements @xmath9 of the @xmath8 decay must be evaluated using tools of nuclear structure theory .",
    "unfortunately , there are no observables that could be simply and directly linked to the magnitude of @xmath8 nuclear matrix elements and that could be used to determine them in an essentially model independent way . in the past , knowledge of the @xmath10-decay rate , and therefore of the corresponding matrix elements @xmath6 , and of the ordinary @xmath11 decay @xmath12 values and the corresponding beta strength distributions , were used to constrain the nuclear model parameters , in particular when the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) was employed @xcite . in the present paper we discuss a novel relation between these nuclear matrix elements .",
    "very early , primakoff and rosen @xcite speculated that since the operators governing @xmath8 and @xmath10 decays differ by a relatively gentle radial dependence , approximately of the form @xmath13 , the corresponding matrix elements might be proportional to each other with the proportionality constant @xmath14 , where @xmath15fm is the nuclear radius .",
    "at that time the authors also believed that the @xmath10 decay can be treated in closure , thus that the corresponding matrix element is dimensionless , while in fact the realistic @xmath10 matrix element has dimension energy@xmath16 . also , the @xmath8 matrix elements are now , by convention , made dimensionless by including the nuclear radius @xmath17 as a multiplicative factor , which is compensated by the factor @xmath18 in the corresponding phase space function @xmath19 .    modern nuclear structure evaluations of these matrix elements do not support the conjecture of proportionality between @xmath9 and @xmath6 .",
    "the rate of the @xmath10 decay has been determined experimentally in many nuclei , and hence the @xmath10 matrix elements @xmath6 are known .",
    "they exhibit pronounced shell effects and vary rather abruptly between nuclei with different @xmath5 and @xmath4 . at the same time",
    ", the calculated @xmath8 nuclear matrix elements , whether based on the qrpa @xcite , nuclear shell model @xcite , or the interacting boson model @xcite , do not show such a variability ; instead they vary relatively smoothly between nuclei with different @xmath20 .",
    "the reason for the difference is , presumably , the very different momentum transfer @xmath21 involved in these matrix elements , even though they involve the same initial and final nuclear states . in the @xmath10 decay the momentum transfer @xmath21 is restricted to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the energy difference of the initial and final atomic masses .",
    "hence , the allowed approximation is valid , @xmath24 , and only the gamow - teller operator @xmath25 and only the @xmath26 virtual intermediate states , contribute . on the other hand , in the @xmath8 decay",
    "the momentum transfer is of the order of the nucleon fermi momentum @xmath27 mev , @xmath28 , and all @xmath29 virtual intermediate states can contribute significantly .",
    "our discussion here sheds more light on the different behavior of the @xmath8 and @xmath10 matrix elements .",
    "it is worthwhile to remember another type of relation , explored in the classic paper by pontecorvo @xcite . at that time",
    "the available information on @xmath1 decay was based on the geochemical determination of the total decay rate , @xmath30 . since these two modes scale very differently with @xmath23 ( @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 ) pontecorvo suggested that comparing the total lifetimes of two isotopes , @xmath35te and @xmath36te , which have very different @xmath23 values , might reveal the presence of the lepton number violating @xmath32 decay , provided the nuclear matrix elements of these two isotopes are identical . while the matrix elements of these two isotopes are indeed rather close , they are not quite the same .",
    "moreover , we know today that the @xmath32 decay rate is very much smaller , if it is indeed nonvanishing , than the @xmath34 decay rate .    the present paper is structured as follows . in the next section",
    "ii we describe the formalism that leads to the relation between the gamow - teller part of the @xmath8 matrix element and the @xmath10 matrix element evaluated in the closure approximation .",
    "we also discuss the validity of the closure approximation in the @xmath8 case . in the following section iii we discuss this novel relation in more detail and show numerous examples . in section",
    "iv we briefly discuss the issue of quenching of the axial current matrix elements . while closure is a rather poor approximation in the @xmath10 case , we argue in section v that combining the known lifetimes with the often measured distribution of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 strengths constrains the @xmath2 values substantially .",
    "we believe that the relation found here allows one to better understand the different behavior of these matrix elements .",
    "we conclude in the last section .",
    "assuming that the @xmath8 decay is caused by the exchange of the light majorana neutrinos , the halflife and the nuclear matrix element are related through @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the easily calculable phase space factor , @xmath41 is the effective neutrino majorana mass whose determination is the ultimate goal of the experiments , and @xmath42 is the nuclear matrix element consisting of gamow - teller , fermi and tensor parts , @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the matrix element ratios that are smaller than unity and , presumably , less dependent on the details of the applied nuclear model . in the following we concetrate on the gt part , @xmath46 ,",
    "which can be somewhat symbolically written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the neutrino potential described in detail below and @xmath49 is the relative distance between the two neutrons that are trasformed in the decay into the two protons .",
    "as function of relative distance of two @xmath11-decaying neutrons in the @xmath50 nucleus .",

    "positive parity multipoles are shown in the upper panel and the negative parity ones in the lower panel .",
    "( color online ) ]     as a function of the relative distance of the decaying neutron pair for different nuclei .",
    "( color online ) ]    in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the qrpa , as well as in ref .",
    "@xcite based on the nuclear shell model , the function @xmath52 that describes the dependence of the @xmath9 on the distance @xmath49 was introduced .",
    "formally , this function can be defined as @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the dirac delta function . obviously , this function is normalized by @xmath55 and has the dimension lenght@xmath16 .",
    "the shape of @xmath56 is very similar in both qrpa and nsm and in all cases consists of a peak with maximum at @xmath57 fm ending near @xmath58 fm , and of very little contributions for larger values of @xmath3 .",
    "now lets turn to the case of the @xmath34 decay mode .",
    "the matrix element @xmath6 governing the @xmath10 decay mode is of the form @xmath59 where the sumation extends over all @xmath26 virtual intermediate states .",
    "we can introduce also the closure analog of @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath2 , by replacing the energies @xmath60 by a properly defined average value @xmath61 .",
    "thus , @xmath62 in analogy with eq .",
    "( [ eq : c(r ) ] ) we can define the new function @xmath63 while the matrix elements @xmath6 and @xmath2 get contributions only from the @xmath26 intermediate states , the function @xmath64 gets contributions from all intermediate multipoles .",
    "this is the consequence of the @xmath65 function in the definition of @xmath66 . when expanded , all multipoles",
    "naturally , when integrated over @xmath3 only the contributions from the @xmath26 are nonvanishing .",
    "an example of the multipole decomposition of @xmath66 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c2nu_mult ] , and in fig .",
    "[ fig : c2nu_nucl ] we show the functions @xmath66 for a variety of @xmath1 decaying nuclei .    for completeness",
    "we show here the qrpa formula used for the evaluation of the function @xmath66 and its multipole decomposition depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : c2nu_mult ] .",
    "first , the function @xmath67 is introduced where @xmath3 is the relative distance between the neutrons in the states @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively protons in @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "then , the part of @xmath66 with the multipolarity @xmath29 is given by @xmath72_j || j^{\\pi } k_f \\rangle \\langle   j^{\\pi } k_f |   j^{\\pi } k_i \\rangle   \\langle   j^{\\pi } k_i || [ c_p^+ \\tilde{c}_n]_j || 0_i^+ \\rangle .",

    "it is now clear that , by construction , @xmath77 which is valid for any shape of the neutrino potential @xmath78 .",
    "thus , if @xmath66 is known , @xmath56 and therefore also @xmath0 can be easily determined .",
    "the equation ( [ eq : basic ] ) represents the basic relation between the @xmath32 and @xmath34 @xmath1-decay modes that we will explore further .    note",
    "that while the function @xmath66 has a substantial negative tail past @xmath79 fm , these distances contribute very little to @xmath56 .",
    "this is a consequence of the shape of the neutrino potential @xmath80 that decreases fast with increasing values of the distance @xmath3 .",
    "the neutrino potential @xmath81 governing the gamow - teller part of the matrix element @xmath9 is defined as @xmath82 where @xmath83 takes into account the finite size of the nucleon and is usually approximated using the above dipole type form factor with @xmath84 gev @xcite(varying @xmath85 between 1.0 - 1.2 gev makes little difference ) .",
    "the function @xmath86 includes the terms from higher order hadron currents , namely induced pseudoscalar and weak - magnetism @xcite . the short range correlations are included using the method of ref .",
    "the jastrow - like two - body function derived there is applied when the radial integrals in both functions @xmath87 and @xmath64 are evaluated ; they do not appear explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pot ] ) .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : pot ] the shape of the potential . when the finite nucleon size , higher order terms are neglected , and @xmath88 is assumed , the potential has coulomb - like shape @xmath89 .",
    "the full potential , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pot ] ) , however , is finite at @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "including the higher order currents and finite @xmath92 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pot ] ) increases the value of @xmath93 by @xmath9430% .    .",
    "different approximate forms , as well as the exact one , are shown ( color online ) . ]     for the indicated nuclei evaluated in the closure approximation as a function of the assumed average excitation energy ( color online ) .",
    "the values of @xmath9 obtained without the closure approximation are 5.24(@xmath51ge ) , 2.62 ( @xmath95zr ) , 4.99 ( @xmath96mo ) , and 4.07 ( @xmath35te ) . ]",
    "the closure approximation , i.e. the replacement of the summation over the virtual intermediate states by matrix element of a two - body operator , is typically used in the evaluation of the @xmath9 .",
    "it is worthwhile to test the validity of this approximation .",
    "such test can be conveniently performed within the qrpa , where the sum over the intermediate states can be easily carried out .",
    "in fact , the calculations performed in refs .",
    "@xcite do not use closure . in this context",
    "one can ask two questions : how good is the closure approximation ? and what is the value of the corresponding average energy ? in fig . [",
    "fig : cl ] we illustrate the answers to these questions .",
    "the exact qrpa matrix elements shown in the caption can be compared with the curves obtained by replacing all intermediate energies with a constant @xmath92 , which is varied there between 0 and 12 mev .",
    "one can see , first of all , that the @xmath9 changes modestly , by less than 10% when @xmath92 is varied and , at the same time , that the exact results are quite close , but somewhat larger , than the closure ones .",
    "thus , using the closure approximation is appropriate for the evaluation of @xmath9 even though it slightly underestimates the @xmath9 values .",
    "however , the corresponding uncertainty is not more than the other uncertainties involved .",
    "we compare the qrpa exact and closure @xmath9 for all nuclei of interest in the next section .",
    "we evaluated the nuclear matrix elements ( nme ) @xmath0 and @xmath9 with and without closure approximation using the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) .",
    "for all nuclear systems the single - particle model space consisted of @xmath97 oscillator shells plus @xmath98 and @xmath99 levels both for protons and neutrons ( 23 single particle states ) .",
    "the single particle energies were obtained from the coulomb  corrected woods ",
    "saxon potential .",
    "two - body interaction g - matrix elements were derived from the argonne v18 one - boson exchange potential within the brueckner theory .",
    "the pairing interaction was adjusted to fit the empirical pairing gaps @xcite .",
    "the particle - particle and particle - hole channels of the g - matrix interaction of the nuclear hamiltonian @xmath100 were renormalized by introducing the parameters @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "while @xmath103 was used throughout , the particle - particle strength parameter @xmath101 was fixed by the data on the two - neutrino double beta decay rates @xcite for each nucleus separately . in the calculation of the @xmath8-decay nmes",
    "the two - nucleon short - range correlations derived from same potential as residual interactions , namely from the argonne potential @xcite , were applied .",
    "the unquenched value of the axial current coupling constant , @xmath104 was used here .",
    "the modifications caused by the quenching of the weak axial current are discussed in the following two sections .    on the other hand ,",
    "the absolute values of @xmath105 were deduced from the averaged values of @xmath10-decay half - lives of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in table [ tab:1 ] we show both the calculated @xmath8 nmes evaluated with and without the closure approximation , as well as only the gt parts of their values .",
    "also shown are the experimental @xmath10-decay nmes . using the qrpa method the closure matrix elements @xmath106 were also evaluated .",
    "one can see that the spread among the candidate nuclei of the @xmath10 nmes is significatly larger when compared with the spread of the calculated @xmath8-decay nmes .",
    "the table also demonstrates that using the closure approximation for evaluation of @xmath9 makes relatively little difference and that the gt part of @xmath9 is dominant in all considered nuclei .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    since our goal is the determination of the gt part of the @xmath8 matrix element @xmath0 , a priori the knowledge of the @xmath2 , which depends only on the @xmath26 intermediate states , is insufficient . according to the eq .",
    "( [ eq : basic ] ) we need for that purpose the function @xmath66 that depends , in principle , on all intermediate multipoles .",
    "however , is we could use the expansion of the spherical bessel function @xmath107 in eq.([eq : pot ] ) in powers of @xmath108 and keep just the first term , the neutrino potential @xmath80 would be represented by a constant and the eq.([eq : basic ] ) would predict a simple proportionality between @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "however , such an expansion does not work .",
    "in reality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pot ] ) @xmath109 and we can not approximate the neutrino potential @xmath80 by its value at @xmath90 . hence , we do not expect a proportionality between @xmath2 and @xmath0 and the qrpa evaluation supports this conclusion .",
    "since the nuclear matrix elements @xmath9 must be determined theoretically , it is of obvious interest to search for any relation between their numerical values and other quantities that are either known from experiments or at least constrained by them .",
    "here we describe such a relation between the dominant gamow - teller part @xmath0 of @xmath9 and the matrix element @xmath2 of the observed @xmath10-decay evaluated in the closure approximation .",
    "the relation is based on the evaluation of the auxiliary functions @xmath56 and @xmath66 that describe the dependence of the corresponding nuclear matrix elements on the distance @xmath3 between the pair of neutrons that is transformed in the @xmath1 decay into a pair of protons .",
    "thus ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : c(r)int ] ) , ( [ eq:2nucl ] ) and ( [ eq : basic ] ) ) @xmath110 represents the required relation .    however ,",
    "while the matrix elements @xmath6 and @xmath2 depend only on the transition strengths and energies of the @xmath26 virtual intermediate states ( they are pure @xmath111 quantities ) , the function @xmath66 gets contribution from all multipoles .",
    "thus , the relation that we found is an indirect one ; even if @xmath106 would be precisely known , the evaluation of the function @xmath66 requires additional nuclear theory input .",
    "nevertheless , the relation in eq . ( [ eq : basic ] ) allows us to obtain a better insight into the problem of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 dependence of the matrix elements @xmath6 and @xmath9 .",
    "while the known @xmath6 have a strong shell dependence , the calculated @xmath9 vary much less .",
    "analysis of the functions @xmath66 and @xmath112 makes it possible to better understand where this fundamental difference comes from .",
    "we show that , so far , the qrpa values of closure approximation @xmath2 matrix elements do not agree well with the same quantities based on the measured @xmath37 and @xmath38 strength functions and on the assumption of coherence ( i.e. same sign ) of contributions of individual states . until this discrepancy",
    "is resolved , it is difficult to employ @xmath2 in order to constrain the magnitude of the @xmath8 matrix elements @xmath0 .",
