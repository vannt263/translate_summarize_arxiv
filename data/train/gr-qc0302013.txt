    "<S> we estimate the upper frequency cutoff of the galactic white dwarf binaries gravitational wave background that will be observable by the lisa detector . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by including the modulation of the gravitational wave signal due the motion of the detector around the sun . </S>",
    "<S> we find this frequency cutoff to be equal to @xmath0hz , a factor of 2 smaller than the values previously derived . </S>",
    "<S> this implies an increase in the number of resolvable signals in the lisa band by a factor of about 4 .    </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical derivation is complemented by a numerical simulation , which shows that by using the maximum likelihood estimation technique it is possible to accurately estimate the parameters of the resolvable signals and then remove them from the lisa data .    </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational waves from short - period binary systems containing white dwarfs and neutron stars are signals guaranteed to be observed by the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) mission . </S>",
    "<S> recent surveys indicate that there exist about twenty of such systems that are emitting gravitational radiation of frequency falling into the lisa band . </S>",
    "<S> population studies have also shown that the number of such sources will be so large to produce a stochastic background that will lie significantly above the lisa instrumental noise in the low - part of its frequency band . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown in the literature ( see @xcite for a recent study and @xcite for earlier investigations ) that these sources will be dominated by detached white dwarf - white dwarf ( wd - wd ) binaries , with @xmath1 of such systems in our galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the detached wd - wd binaries evolve by gravitational - radiation reaction and the number of such sources rapidly decreases with increasing orbital frequency . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore expected that above a certain limit frequency one will be able to resolve individual signals .    in this communication </S>",
    "<S> we calculate this limit frequency by including the effect of the signal modulation induced by the motion of lisa around the sun . </S>",
    "<S> earlier derivations assumed that one would be able to resolve only one signal per frequency bin . </S>",
    "<S> however , the modulation of the signal depends on the position of the source in the sky and therefore , by using matched - filtering technique , it is possible to resolve signals with same frequency but incoming from different directions .    the number distribution , @xmath2 , of the detached wd - wd binaries has been estimated in @xcite to be equal to    @xmath3    where yr is expressed in seconds , and @xmath4hz . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for an observation time of @xmath5 years , the number of sources in one frequency bin,@xmath6 , can be approximated by the following formula @xmath7 if the signals were monochromatic one would expect to resolve roughly one source per frequency bin . consequently , by equating @xmath6 to 1 and assuming 1 year of observation time , we would get an upper frequency cutoff equal to @xmath8 . however , by accounting in the data analysis for the modulation of the signal due to the motion of lisa around the sun , it is possible to resolve signals of equal frequency but incoming from different sky positions .    to estimate this effect </S>",
    "<S> we represent the lisa response , to a monochromatic gravitational wave signal , in the following form @xmath9 where the amplitude @xmath10 is assumed to be constant , and the phase @xmath11 , which includes the doppler modulation , is given by @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the angular frequency of the wave , @xmath14yr , ( @xmath15 ) are ecliptic coordinates of the source , @xmath16au , @xmath17 is a known phase determining the position of the detector in the orbit around the sun and @xmath18 is an unknown , constant phase of the signal . </S>",
    "<S> this is a reasonable approximation since the time scale over which the detector s response amplitude changes is significantly longer than that of the phase .    </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to introduce the following linear parameterization of the signal @xmath19,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 in this parameterization the phase of the signal is a linear function of the signal s unknown parameters ( @xmath21 , @xmath13 , a , b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced normalized correlation function of the signal is given by @xcite @xmath22\\ , dx)^2 + \\\\      & & ( \\int^1_0\\sin[\\delta w x + \\delta a\\cos(2\\pi n x ) + \\delta      b\\sin(2\\pi n x)]\\ , dx)^2 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced a new dimensionless frequency parameter @xmath23 , and the new dimensionless time variable @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation function above is derived under the assumption that , over the bandwidth of the signal , the spectral density of the noise can be considered constant . as a consequence of the linearity of the phase of the signal in the parameters , the correlation function of two signals depends only on the difference between the values of the parameters and not on their absolute values . in the above parameterization </S>",
    "<S> the parameter space can be visualized as a truncated cone whose base and top are discs of radii @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively , with @xmath27 and @xmath28 being the angular frequencies of the upper and the lower edge of the bandwidth of the detector . for a given angular frequency @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> the parameter space is a disc of radius @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> each point of the disc corresponds to two positions in the sky which differ by the sign in the ecliptic latitude angle @xmath30 .    in order to derive the background upper frequency cutoff we need to estimate the number of signals resolvable in a given frequency bin </S>",
    "<S> this can be done by studying the correlation function between the signals in the a - b plane , and choosing a particular value for it . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we have assumed two signals to be resolvable if their normalized correlation is less than 1/2 . </S>",
    "<S> this choice of course is not optimal , and the final result of the upper frequency cutoff will depend on it . however , larger values of the correlation function imply a lower upper frequency cutoff , as it will be shown below . here </S>",
    "<S> we do not identify the optimal value of the correlation function , which will be estimated in a forthcoming paper via monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the reader should keep in mind this point when interpreting the conclusions of this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> the correlation surface in the a - b plane can be approximated by an ellipse whose area , @xmath31 , can be calculated using the covariance matrix ( which is the inverse of the fisher information matrix ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fisher matrix , @xmath32 , for the signal ( [ lm ] ) is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> its expression has been derived under the assumption that , over the bandwidth of the signal , the spectral density of the noise can be considered constant . </S>",
    "<S> if we also assume the integration time to be a integer multiple of 1 year , then the fisher matrix becomes @xmath35 in the above expressions for @xmath32 we have also normalized the signal - to - noise ratio to 1 .    </S>",
    "<S> since the area of the correlation ellipse is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the 2 by 2 sub - matrix of the covariance matrix for the parameters a and b , it follows that the number of resolved signals in a frequency bin centered on the frequency @xmath38 is given by the ratio of the area of the disc of radius @xmath39 , and the area of the correlation ellipse @xmath31 . in mathematical terms </S>",
    "<S> we have : @xmath40 with @xmath41 if we equate the number of resolved signals , @xmath42 , to the number @xmath6 of expected signals in one frequency bin ( eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ns ] ) ) , we get the following formula for the upper frequency cutoff , @xmath43 , of the background @xmath44 equation ( [ fr ] ) implies a frequency cutoff @xmath45hz when a year of observation time is assumed .    by using the expression of the number of signals per frequency bin given in equation ( [ df ] ) , we find that the number of detached white dwarf binaries above the frequency @xmath43 is around @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> although all these binaries can in principle be resolved , not all of them can be detected as some will have an amplitude smaller than the value of the detection threshold . to calculate the number of detectable binaries we first need to estimate the threshold corresponding to a satisfactory confidence of detection . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that we shall process the data by matched filtering . for the linear phase model of the signal given above we can adopt methods developed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first we need to calculate the number of cells , @xmath47 , in the parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> these are the number of realizations of the optimal filter whose correlation is smaller than a pre - chosen value ( 1/2 in our case ) . </S>",
    "<S> this number is given by the ratio between the volume of the characteristic correlation hypersurface and the volume of the parameter space over which the search is performed . in our case </S>",
    "<S> the volume of the parameter space is given by @xmath48 while the volume @xmath49 of the correlation ellipsoid can be obtained by using the covariance matrix : @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the 3 by 3 sub - matrix of the covariance matrix for the parameters @xmath52 , and @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> in reference @xcite , eq.(77 ) , it was shown that for gaussian noise , the false alarm probability can be written as follows @xmath54^{n_c } \\ , \\label{son}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the threshold on the following optimal statistics function @xcite @xmath56 } \\ </S>",
    "<S> dt\\right|^2 . \\label{gr2}\\ ] ] in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gr2 ] ) @xmath57 is the value of the two - sided power spectral density of the noise estimated in the center of the frequency bandwidth of the signal , and @xmath58 is the lisa data stream .    equation ( [ son ] ) implies that , with a false alarm probability of @xmath59 percent , the corresponding threshold signal - to - noise ratio is equal to @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding number of resolvable white dwarf binaries with signal - to - noise above this threshold is equal to @xmath61 , under the assumption of sources uniformly distributed in the galactic disk . as a comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the number of resolvable binaries calculated without including the effects of the phase modulation of the signals is equal to 919 , a factor of @xmath62 smaller than what we estimate .    </S>",
    "<S> this threshold is of course rather conservative , since it reflects the assumption that we are searching for one or more signals in the data , and we should therefore regard it as an upper - bound . in reality </S>",
    "<S> these signals are present in the lisa data and , in order to calculate the lower bound for the threshold , we can assume each cell to contain a signal . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the false - alarm probability becomes @xmath63 since now @xmath64 in equation ( [ son ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding threshold signal - to - noise ratio goes down to 2.7 , again for a false alarm probability of @xmath59 percent . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that @xmath65 white - dwarf binaries of signal - to - noise ratio larger than this threshold will be resolvable . if we neglect the effects of the phase modulation of the signals , the number of resolvable binaries is equal to @xmath66 instead .    as a demonstration of </S>",
    "<S> how well the parameters of the signals can be estimated by using the maximum likelihood method , we have performed a numerical simulation of our technique . </S>",
    "<S> we first estimate the parameters of the strongest signal , we remove it from the data , and then iterate these two steps until no signal crosses our predefined threshold . the numerical procedure for locating the maximum consists of two steps . </S>",
    "<S> the first is a coarse search of the maximum of the likelihood function on a predefined grid in the parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> this is then followed by a refinement around the region of the parameter space where the maximum identified by the coarse search is located . </S>",
    "<S> this second stage of the maximization is performed by using a numerical implementation of the nelder - mead algorithm , where the starting point of the maximization is determined by the values of the parameters identified by the coarse search .    </S>",
    "<S> a graphical representation of the effectiveness of our method is presented in figures 1 and 2 , which correspond to two different combinations of signals in the lisa data . </S>",
    "<S> both figures show two sinusoidal signals of identical frequencies , and incoming from different two directions in the sky . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation between the two signals was chosen to be approximately equal to 1/2 . in figure 1 </S>",
    "<S> we input signals with signal - to - noise ratios equal to 7 and 20 , while in figure 2 the signal - to - noise ratios have been increased to 20 and 60 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the common frequency of the signals ( @xmath67 hz ) , and their incoming directions in the sky are unchanged in both figures .     </S>",
    "<S> +     +     +     +    a visual inspection of the plots shows that the estimation of the parameters and the resolution of the signals ( with the use of the maximum likelihood method ) can be expected to be satisfactory for removing them from the data . </S>",
    "<S> this will make possible the search of other signals potentially present in the lisa data . </S>"
