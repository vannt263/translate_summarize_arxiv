    "various natural processes and human activities are responsible for changes in habitat structure , quality and its fragmentation",
    ". a consequence of habitat reduction or destruction can be very severe and result in extinction of populations and loss of biodiversity .",
    "understanding how habitat fragmentation and heterogeneity , climate change and seasonality interact with internal factors of population growth and influence population dynamics may provide a useful tool for conservation and managing of species ( @xcite ) .",
    "the idea that spatial structure is important and should be considered in studying population dynamics is not new .",
    "it is clear that there are no two identical habitats and that some are better than others .",
    "this can be linked to habitat heterogeneity and to the source - sink systems .",
    "a high quality habitat ( source ) yields positive growth rate of population , while low quality habitat ( sink ) has the opposite effect .",
    "for a species that inhabits several patches , possibility to move from one patch to another can be crucial for survival .",
    "migration from source to sink has been studied and its stabilizing effect for population or even ecosystem is well - known .",
    "the importance of migration is in the fact that arrival of immigrants to the sink can save local population from extinction ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "no matter how important , spatial structure is not the only factor that influence population dynamics .",
    "it should be viewed as one of the pivotal factors and studied in combination with population structure , temporal variability and density - dependence ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "all mentioned factors have relative importance for population dynamics which differs for terrestrial and marine species , vertebrate and invertebrate , plants and animals , large and small populations etc .",
    "the challenge is to make a model that includes all these factors and yet remains simple enough in order to be applicable to real world problems .",
    "however , in spite of the evidence that various internal and external factors interact and contribute to population dynamics and complexity of ecological systems , a usual practice is to study only one or few of them , but not all of them simultaneously .",
    "we mention some of them .",
    "gurtin and mccamy introduced age - structured density dependent model in @xcite .",
    "chipot considered age - structured models with time and density - dependency in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "allen in @xcite studies different dispersion mechanisms for the logistic model without age - structure and without time - dependency in vital rates .",
    "cui and chen in @xcite and @xcite study the effect of diffusion on a single species or for predator - prey system , but they do not consider structured population .",
    "the system of delay differential equations developed by so , wu and zou in @xcite deals with population divided into two age classes ( immature and adult ) and assumes that population inhabits two identical patches and that the vital rates are time - independent . in @xcite ,",
    "weng , xiao and zou extended the model of so , wu and zou in @xcite and considered dynamics of population on three patches .",
    "terry in @xcite investigates population of two stages and on two patches and discusses persistence of population for different birth functions and dispersion patterns .",
    "takeuchi in @xcite and @xcite examined stability and effect of diffusion of generalized lotka - volterra systems .",
    "hastings discussed stabilizing effect of dispersal in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the previous papers , we consider age - structure , time and density - dependence and dispersion between patches and investigate their impact on population dynamics . in formulation of the model we rely on several assumptions : population is age - structured and inhabits @xmath0 patches .",
    "in addition to this , environment changes with time , causing the change in the vital rates , competition level and dispersion coefficients .",
    "competition for the resources occurs within each age - class which results in increased density - dependent mortality .",
    "the patches are not identical and they do not have to be physically close , because many pest species exploit trading and transportation networks to move from one patch to another .",
    "under the made assumptions on mind , the system of balance equations for the model becomes : @xmath1 and the boundary and initial conditions are : @xmath2 and @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the number of individuals of age @xmath5 at time @xmath6 on patch @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the death rate , @xmath9 the regulating function , @xmath10 the matrix of dispersion coefficients , @xmath11 the birth rate and @xmath12 the initial distribution of population .",
    "the regulating function @xmath9 represents limitations imposed on individuals by environment ( or available resource per capita ) and the logistic term @xmath13 describes increment in mortality due to population density .",
    "the regulation function resembles carrying capacity because for small values of @xmath9 mortality grows and for its large values , logistic term tends to zero . unlike carrying capacity",
    "it does not represent maximal supported population .",
    "we will use it as a starting point in study of relation between age - structure and density - dependence .",
    "underlying assumption is that population does not have to occupy all patches at initial time , but in order for population to survive , sufficiently young individuals must occupy at least one patch .",
    "nonnegative dispersion coefficients @xmath14 for @xmath15 define proportion of individuals of age @xmath5 at time @xmath6 on patch @xmath16 that migrates to patch @xmath7 .",
    "every patch @xmath7 can be reached from every other patch @xmath16 , possibly via several passing patches .",
    "dispersion coefficients @xmath17 define proportion of population of age @xmath5 at time @xmath6 that leaves patch @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , we also assume that the dispersion matrix is _ essentially positive _",
    ", i.e. for any @xmath15 there exist pairwise distinct indices @xmath18 such that @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 for any @xmath22 .",
    "the latter condition has the following natural explanation .",
    "let us associate a directed graph @xmath23 to the dispersion matrix @xmath24 as follows : the nodes of the graph are presented by the @xmath0 patches and the edges represent the transitions between patches according to the dispersion coefficients @xmath25 such that the @xmath26-entry of the incidence matrix of @xmath23 is @xmath27 if @xmath28 , and @xmath29 if @xmath30 .",
    "then @xmath24 satisfy the above condition if and only if the graph @xmath31 is connected ( i.e. there is a path between every pair of vertices ) .",
    "an examples of an essentially positive matrix is @xmath32 where @xmath33 means an entry of an unspecified sign .",
    "in this section we briefly describe our strategy and the principal results .",
    "the first main result is the existence and uniqueness of solution to the problem ( [ genpr])([genic ] ) in the class of bounded continuous functions . to this end , we consider the problem with time - independent vital rates , regulating function and dispersion coefficients .",
    "namely , in order to determine the number of newborns @xmath34we introduce two auxiliary initial value problems as follows .",
    "let @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote respectively the solutions of the following initial value problems : @xmath37 it can be shown that each of the latter problems has a unique _ nonnegative _ solution .",
    "then , the original problem can be reduced to the integral equation @xmath38 where @xmath39 and the operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 are defined componentwise by @xmath42    in the time - independent case , an important role in description and analysis of solutions to ( [ newb ] ) plays the so - called characteristic equation , i.e. the ( unique ) solution to @xmath43 here the operator @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 i.e. when the newborns function @xmath46 is constant for all @xmath47 .",
    "clearly , @xmath48 is always a solution of the characteristic equation , but our goal is to find out when a nontrivial solution @xmath49 does exist and is unique",
    ".    an important ingredient of our approach is the operator @xmath50 defined by the right hand side in ( [ genbc ] ) , where @xmath4 solves ( [ genpr ] ) but without nonlinear term ( formally assuming that @xmath51 ) and with the boundary condition @xmath52 .",
    "we show that it can be alternatively defined as the blow - up of @xmath44 : @xmath53 due to assumptions on dispersion coefficients @xmath14 , this operator can be shown to be strongly positive and linear .",
    "then an important corollary of the krein - rutman theorem is that its spectral radius @xmath54 is equal to the largest positive eigenvalue .",
    "thus defined operator @xmath55 is called the _ net reproductive map _ and @xmath54 is the net reproductive rate .",
    "notice that in the one - dimensional case , @xmath54 coincides with the net reproductive rate @xmath56 which is a well - established concept and it is defined by @xmath57 the net reproductive operator is just multiplication by this number . in @xcite we proved that @xmath56 corresponds to the characteristic equation @xmath58 through which it is related to the average number of newborns @xmath59 .",
    "moreover , population declines for @xmath60 and grows for @xmath61 .",
    "we show that our definition is in consistence with the classical definition in one - dimensional case . within this framework , we are able to characterize stationary solutions to the characteristic equation ( [ charact ] ) .",
    "namely , the following dichotomy holds    [ th1 ] if @xmath62 , then the characteristic equation has only trivial solution @xmath63 .",
    "if @xmath64 , then the characteristic equation has exactly one nontrivial solution @xmath65 whose all components are positive .",
    "one of ingredients of the proof is the following monotonicity result which has a considerable interest in itself .",
    "here and in what follows we use the standard notation vector order relation : given two vectors @xmath66 one defines @xmath67 if @xmath68 for all @xmath69 .",
    "further , @xmath70 if @xmath67 and @xmath71 , and @xmath72 if @xmath73 for all @xmath69 .    [ lemma2 ] let @xmath74 be locally lipschitz functions satisfying @xmath75 and @xmath76 where @xmath77 are continuous in @xmath78 and @xmath79 for all @xmath80",
    ". then @xmath81 on @xmath78 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath82 is essentially positive and @xmath83 then @xmath84 on @xmath85 .    another important ingredient of the proof is a suitable generalization of the existence and the uniqueness results for monotone and concave operators established by krasnoselskii and zabreiko in @xcite .    our next result concerns solutions of the integral equation ( [ newb ] ) .",
    "we show that an a priori nonconstant solutions tends to the ( constant ) solution of the characteristic equation ( [ charact ] ) .",
    "in other words ,    let @xmath86 be a solution to ( [ newb ] ) . if @xmath62 then @xmath87 as @xmath88 .",
    "if @xmath64 , then @xmath89 as @xmath88 , where @xmath65 is defined by theorem  [ th1 ] .",
    "in particular , @xmath90 and @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the total population and @xmath93 is a solution to the original problem with @xmath65 as the initial condition .    in this way , the net reproductive rate @xmath54 effectively determines large time behavior of population on @xmath0 patches in constant environment . here , as in the one - dimensional case",
    ", @xmath62 implies extinction of population on all patches , while @xmath64 grants persistence of population .",
    "most natural habitats are positively autocorrelated , see for example @xcite . thus , the assumption that the vital rates , regulating function and dispersal coefficient are changing periodically with respect to time is reasonable . in studying large time behavior of solution to equation ( [ newb ] ) in periodically changing environment , a pivotal role belongs to the characteristic equation @xmath94 , where operator @xmath95 is given by the right hand side of ( [ genbc ] ) and @xmath4 solves ( [ genpr ] ) with periodic boundary condition @xmath96 , @xmath97 .    similarly to the previous situation",
    ", we introduce the net reproductive operator @xmath98 by the right hand side of ( [ genbc ] ) assuming that @xmath4 solves ( [ genpr ] ) without nonlinear term and with periodic boundary condition @xmath96 . in this case",
    ", we have that @xmath99 operator @xmath98 is strictly positive , linear and defined on space of periodic continuous functions .",
    "its spectral radius @xmath100 is equal to the largest eigenvalue and it is called the net reproductive rate .",
    "one of the main results about periodic case is that if @xmath101 , then the characteristic equation @xmath94 has only trivial solution @xmath102 . if @xmath103 , then the characteristic equation has exactly one nontrivial solution @xmath104 , where all components are positive periodic functions .",
    "furthermore , we show that the number of newborns in periodic case converges to a unique periodic solution of the characteristic equation . for the total population",
    ", the result can be formulated in the following way : @xmath105 and @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a solution to the original initial value problem and @xmath104 is a periodic solution to the characteristic equation . in this situation , as in the time - independent case , the net reproductive rate @xmath100 determines extinction or persistence of population on all patches .",
    "upper and lower bounds for population growth can be found even if environment is changing irregularly .",
    "namely , if the parameters of the original model are estimated from above and below by periodic functions for large time , then two periodic problems can be formulated .",
    "one of these periodic problems is an upper bound for the original problem , and the other is a lower bound . the number of newborns in the original problem , @xmath108 ,",
    "is then estimated by the number of newborns in periodic problems .",
    "in other words , the following holds : @xmath109 where @xmath110 are solutions of the characteristic equations for periodic problems and @xmath111 is an arbitrary small number .    in order to explain the influence of dispersion on persistence of population , we compare the system of @xmath0 patches with dispersion with the system of @xmath0 isolated patches . to obtain the net reproductive operator @xmath112 and the net reproductive rate @xmath113 , we use system ( [ genpr ] ) without nonlinear term . in the worst case scenario for the system with dispersion ,",
    "all migrants die before reaching next patch i.e. @xmath114 for @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath15 . in this case",
    "we estimate @xmath4 in the following way @xmath117 and obtain @xmath118 this implies that @xmath119 and @xmath120 on the other hand , the system of isolated patches corresponds to the problem ( [ genpr])([genic ] ) with @xmath121 for @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "the net reproductive rate on each patch is @xmath124 if @xmath125 for some @xmath7 , extinction of population on patch @xmath7 is imminent .",
    "however , according to ( [ est : sigma ] ) , it follows that @xmath126 if there exists at least one patch such that @xmath127 and @xmath128 is small enough .",
    "this means that persistence of population on all patches is possible under assumption that population would persist on at least one patch and that the number of individuals emigrating from this patch is sufficiently small .",
    "previously , we have established conditions that ensures persistence of population in time - independent case and for periodically changing environment . here we establish asymptotic behavior of the solution to the main model in the general time - dependent case in two ways : by using periodic functions to formulate upper and lower bounds and by finding upper and lower boundaries for the sum of newborns on all patches and for the total population by relaxing conditions for dispersion . in the first case",
    ", we will find conditions for extinction or persistence of population under assumption that the vital rates , regulating function and dispersion coefficients are bounded by periodic functions . in the second case",
    "we obtain a crude estimate of newborns density and total population which will not depend on migration pattern .",
    "suppose that the vital rates , regulating function and dispersion coefficients have periodic bounds , or , in other words , that the following estimates hold for the structure coefficients and large  @xmath6 : @xmath129 where @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 are some @xmath134-periodic functions . instead of the original problem ( [ genpr ] )",
    ", we study two associated periodic problems with parameters defined by ( [ pb ] ) .",
    "it is natural to expect that @xmath135 will be bounded from above and below by @xmath110 for sufficiently large @xmath6 , where @xmath135 is a number of newborns in the original problem and @xmath136 are solutions to the characteristic equations related to periodic problems @xmath137 where operators @xmath138 are defined componentwise by @xmath139 the functions @xmath140 are unique solutions to the initial value problems @xmath141 where the coefficients are t - periodic and satisfy condition ( [ pb ] ) and the initial conditions are given by a vector - function @xmath142 such that @xmath143 then @xmath144 where operators @xmath145 and @xmath146 are defined component - wise by @xmath147    the corresponding net reproductive operators and net reproductive rates are denoted by @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "then the next result states that the number of newborns in irregularly changing environment can be bounded from above and below by the number of newborns in the associated periodically changing environments .",
    "let @xmath108 be a solution to equation ( [ newb ] ) .",
    "if @xmath150 , then @xmath87 as @xmath88 . if @xmath151 , then @xmath152 where @xmath110 are solutions to ( [ charpkpm ] ) and @xmath153 is an arbitrary positive number .                        c.  a. schmidt - wellenburg et .",
