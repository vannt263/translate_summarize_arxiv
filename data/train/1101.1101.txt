    "with recent advance in m2-brane physics from chern - simons - matter theories @xcite , it became clear that many essential aspects of m2-branes can be understood only when we have good controls over strongly coupled quantum field theories .",
    "the strong coupling physics is crucial in supersymmetry enhancement and appearance of m - theory states from monopole operators @xcite , the partition function and wilson loops on @xmath2 @xcite , determination of exact @xmath3 r - symmetry in @xmath4 theories @xcite , the @xmath5 degrees of freedom @xcite , to list a few examples .",
    "analogous phenomena are either absent or turn out to be substantially simpler in 4 dimensional yang - mills theories for d3-branes . also , the physics often depends on the chern - simons level @xmath6 in a more nontrivial way than the yang - mills coupling constant .",
    "the roles of strong coupling dynamics turn out to be even more important for understanding m2-brane systems with mass gap .",
    "the simplest m2-brane theory with a mass gap is the mass - deformed @xmath0 chern - simons - matter theory @xcite .",
    "this theory has many discrete supersymmetric vacua , whose classical solutions are first found in @xcite and refined in @xcite . when chern - simons level @xmath6 is @xmath7 , the gravity duals of the supersymmetric vacua are found by lin , lunin and maldacena @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "a puzzle was that the number of the gravity solutions is much smaller than that of the classical field theory vacua found in @xcite .",
    "this puzzle was recently resolved in @xcite .",
    "many classically supersymmetric vacua of @xcite dynamically break supersymmetry , after which one obtains a perfect agreement between the supersymmetric vacua of gauge theory and gravity at @xmath8 .",
    "theory admits dynamical supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the analysis of @xcite is from the ` uv completion ' of this theory ( yang - mills chern - simons - matter theory ) which can have no more than @xmath9 supersymmetry .",
    "the result remains the same as one flows to ir , continuously taking the yang - mills mass scale back to infinity . ]",
    "the analysis of @xcite provides the partition function ( or more precisely , the index ) of supersymmetric vacua at arbitrary chern - simons level @xmath6 , whose gravity duals are not well understood . the goal of this paper is to identify and study the gravity duals of mass - deformed @xmath0 theory at general coupling @xmath6 .",
    "our results are very simple .",
    "the gravity duals for general @xmath6 can be obtained from those for @xmath8 @xcite by introducing @xmath1 quotients , similar to the conformal chern - simons - matter theory @xcite .",
    "this fact has been already noticed and partially studied in @xcite .",
    "another important aspect is that , contrary to the orbifold of @xmath10 , the orbifold of the mass - deformed geometry has fixed points of the local form @xmath11 . to correctly understand the gravity duals",
    ", one has to take into account the degrees of freedom localized on these fixed points .",
    "we find that fractional m2-branes @xcite are stuck to some of these fixed points , which appear in the gravity solutions as discrete torsions .",
    "we find a set of gravity vacua which are in 1-to-1 map to the field theory vacua of @xcite , showing correct properties to be the gravity duals of the latter .",
    "having obtained the precise map between the gravity backgrounds and the field theory vacua , it could be possible to precisely address many questions on the gauge / gravity duality of this system .",
    "for instance , the vortex solitons @xcite in this theory have been studied from the gravity duals @xcite using the probe d0-brane analysis at large @xmath6 .",
    "the results of this paper may help resolve some of the puzzles concerning these objects , raised in @xcite .",
    "m2-brane systems with mass - gap could also have potential applications to low dimensional condensed matter systems .",
    "for instance , it is well known that quantum hall systems admit a low energy description based on chern - simons theory .",
    "addition of quasi - particles to this system would yield a chern - simons theory coupled to massive charged matters .",
    "there are some studies of ( fractional ) quantum hall systems based on conformal chern - simons - matter theories @xcite . as the quantum hall systems are gapped in the bulk , it should be interesting to see if one can refine these studies with the mass - deformed m2-brane systems .    having such future directions aside , we study some basic properties of various vacua , such as the spectrum of elementary excitations .",
    "after some part of the gauge symmetry @xmath12 is higgsed in a vacuum , the unbroken part of the gauge group sometimes exhibits non - perturbative dynamics , similar to the confinement in @xmath13 yang - mills chern - simons theories studied in @xcite .",
    "this fact can be captured by recently studied seiberg - like dualities in 3 dimensions @xcite , and also is correctly encoded in our gravity dual .",
    "we also study the gravity duals of massive charged particles , given by open membranes connecting various fractional m2-branes at the orbifold fixed points .",
    "the perturbative field theory analysis of bps charged particles is reliable when the t hooft couplings of unbroken gauge groups are small , while classical open m2-brane analysis is reliable when the membrane is macroscopic .",
    "we find a good agreement between the two spectra when both calculations are reliable .",
    "although we only discuss bps particles in this paper , similar comparison can be made with non - bps particles .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we first explain the results of @xcite which identifies the supersymmetric vacua of the field theory .",
    "then after explaining the gravity duals of the field theory vacua at @xmath8 , we introduce a @xmath1 orbifold and discrete torsions for general chern - simons level @xmath6 . taking the fractional m2-branes into account",
    ", we show that the supersymmetric ground states of the gravity solutions perfectly map to the field theory vacua , with correct quantitative properties like symmetry or m2-brane charges .",
    "the general considerations are illustrated by some examples in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we study some elementary excitations in the context of gauge - gravity duality . a brief comment on non - relativistic conformal symmetry is also given . in section 5 , we conclude with discussions on future directions .",
    "appendix a summarizes the supersymmetry of gravity solutions and various probe branes .",
    "appendix b explains the @xmath14 tensor description of the classical vacua .",
    "appendix c presents the mass calculation of charged particles from the field theory .",
    "chern - simons - matter theory with mass deformation preserving @xmath0 poincare supersymmetry was constructed and discussed in @xcite .",
    "the theory has four complex scalars in bi - fundamental representations of the @xmath15 gauge group , where the subscripts @xmath6 and @xmath16 denote the chern - simons levels .",
    "the classical and quantum supersymmetric vacua of this theory have been studied in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . at @xmath8 ,",
    "the gravity duals of the quantum supersymmetric vacua are constructed in @xcite , which are asymptotic to @xmath10 in uv and exhibit complicated ` bubbles ' of m2-branes polarized into m5-branes @xcite .",
    "after semi - classical quantization of the 4-form fluxes , the discretized gravity solutions are in 1-to-1 correspondence to the supersymmetric vacua @xcite .    in this section ,",
    "we review the supersymmetric vacua of the field theory identified in @xcite for general @xmath6 , explain the gravity duals for @xmath8 obtained in @xcite , and present the generalization for arbitrary @xmath6 .",
    "then we propose the map between the gravity solutions and the field theory vacua with various evidences .      before mass deformation",
    ", there is an @xmath17 r - symmetry which rotates the four complex scalars @xmath18 ( for @xmath19 ) in the fundamental representation .",
    "the mass deformation breaks this r - symmetry to @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 rotate @xmath23 and @xmath24 as doublets , respectively .",
    "see @xcite for the details .",
    "the classical supersymmetric vacua are given by scalar configurations with vanishing bosonic potential .",
    "the general solution is given by a direct sum of the following blocks .",
    "the blocks of first type are @xmath25 rectangular matrices with one more column , with @xmath26 .",
    "the blocks with @xmath27 denote empty columns . in this block ,",
    "two scalars @xmath24 are taken to be zero , while the other two scalars are ( @xmath28 is the mass parameter @xcite ) @xmath29 below , we shall call this the @xmath30th block of first type .",
    "the blocks of second type are @xmath31 rectangular matrices with one more row , again with @xmath26 .",
    "blocks with @xmath27 denote empty rows . here",
    "the two scalars @xmath23 are zero , while @xmath32 we shall call this the @xmath30th block of second type .",
    "the classical supersymmetric vacua are parametrized by specifying how many blocks of different types and sizes are included in the direct sum .",
    "we denote by @xmath33 the number of the @xmath30th block of first type , and by @xmath34 that of the @xmath30th block of second type .",
    "an example of our parametrization is shown in fig [ direct - sum ] .",
    "as the direct sum ( including @xmath35 empty rows and @xmath36 empty columns ) should form an @xmath37 matrix , we obtain the following constraints on these ` occupation numbers ' @xmath38 : @xmath39=n\\ , \\ \\",
    "\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\left[(n\\!+\\!1)n_n+nn_n^\\prime\\right]=n\\ .\\ ] ] the first and second conditions are restrictions on the numbers of rows and columns .",
    "equivalently , we obtain the following two constraints @xmath40 which will be a more suggestive form for later interpretation .    .",
    "grey boxes denote blocks with nonzero @xmath23 or @xmath24 . in this figure ,",
    "the occupation numbers are @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , with all other numbers being zero.,width=302 ]    among these classical zero energy solutions , only some of them remain to be exactly supersymmetric at the quantum level .",
    "we take the chern - simons level @xmath6 to be positive without losing generality .",
    "the vacua which survive to be supersymmetric quantum mechanically should satisfy @xcite @xmath45 for all occupation numbers .",
    "furthermore , when these restrictions are satisfied , the degeneracy ( or more precisely the witten index ) of the supersymmetric vacua is @xmath46 for given @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the total number of supersymmetric vacua with given rank @xmath47 ( i.e. for a given theory ) is the summation of the degeneracy of the form ( [ degeneracy ] ) , taken for all occupation numbers satisfying ( [ constraint-1 ] ) and ( [ constraint-2 ] ) .",
    "one can also generalize the identification of supersymmetric vacua in @xcite to the mass - deformed @xmath0 theory with @xmath48 gauge group , where @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the only change for the classical supersymmetric vacua is to replace ( [ constraint-1 ] ) by @xmath50 while the conditions ( [ constraint-2 ] ) and the degeneracy ( [ degeneracy ] ) remain the same .     with @xmath51 .",

    "the young diagrams with charges @xmath53 correspond to the droplets : the edge lengths of the diagrams and the droplets match , as illustrated by the numbers.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    another way of viewing these supersymmetric vacua is to use @xmath6 species of fermions , or ` colored ' fermions , with occupation numbers @xmath54 , @xmath55 ( for @xmath56 ) being either @xmath57 or @xmath7 . being blind to the @xmath6 ` color ' quantum numbers , one obtains the combinatoric factor ( [ degeneracy ] ) in the degeneracy by taking @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "the first condition of ( [ constraint-1 ] ) about the rank @xmath47 is simply the overall energy condition for @xmath6 pairs of chiral fermions in @xmath60 dimensions .",
    "as the energy level @xmath61 is half - integral , the fermions are in the neveu - schwarz sector .",
    "the second condition of ( [ constraint-1 ] ) becomes the overall @xmath3 singlet condition for the sum over the @xmath62 color charges , where the particles with the occupation numbers @xmath54 carry charge @xmath63 and anti - particles with occupation numbers @xmath55 carry charge @xmath64 .",
    "in other words , this condition sets the sum of @xmath6 fermi energy levels to be @xmath57 . for the theory with nonzero @xmath65",
    ", the last condition modifies to setting the sum of fermi levels to be @xmath65 .",
    "such fermion viewpoint of the occupations can be illustrated as ` droplets ' like fig.[colored - droplet ] . in each droplet , an occupied sector with @xmath66 or @xmath67",
    "is represented by filling the @xmath30th level above / beneath the fermi level ( denoted by @xmath68 ) with a black / white stripe , respectively . in this example , the field theory occupation numbers are @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and others zero .",
    "one can also bosonize the @xmath6 colored fermions to @xmath6 chiral bosons on a circle , namely to @xmath6 compact bosons .",
    "the @xmath62 charges become the quantized momenta @xmath76 ( for @xmath77 ) of @xmath6 bosons on the circle .",
    "the neutrality of overall @xmath3 ( or sum of fermi levels being @xmath65 ) corresponds to the restriction @xmath78 the possible excitations of the @xmath6 bosons map to the so - called colored partitions of @xmath47 , which consists of @xmath6 young diagrams with @xmath62 charges @xmath79 .",
    "the first condition of ( [ constraint-1 ] ) on the energy of @xmath6 fermions can be rewritten in the bosonized picture as @xmath80 where @xmath81 are excitations of the _ bosonic oscillators _ ( not to be confused with fermionic occupations with same notation above ) , and @xmath79 are subject to the constraint ( [ constraint-3 ] ) .",
    "note that the first term on the right hand side of ( [ bosonized - energy ] ) is the kinetic energy of @xmath6 zero modes .    in the bosonized picture",
    ", it is easy to calculate the partition function @xmath82 for the supersymmetric vacua , which trades the energy with the chemical potential @xmath83 as @xmath84 $ ] .",
    "the partition function for the @xmath6 compact bosons with net momentum @xmath65 is @xmath85 the first factor comes from the @xmath6 young diagrams , while the second factor is from the kinetic energy of zero modes .",
    "this is a generalization of the result of @xcite for @xmath51 . for @xmath8",
    ", @xmath86 agrees with the degeneracy of the gravity solutions of @xcite , as shown in @xcite . strictly speaking ,",
    "the above vacua are obtained by deforming the theory appropriately , under which only the witten index is invariant .",
    "so this partition function is the witten index of the field theory .",

    "the strips below the fermi level are labeled similarly , again by increasing non - negative integers as we move down away from the fermi level . in each strip , the length of the black region contained in this strip is the discrete torsion assigned to this strip .",

    "for instance , at @xmath296 , one can eliminate a box at each convex corner hosting nonzero torsion from the six young diagrams in fig [ k2n2negative ] , to obtain one of the young diagrams in fig [ k2n2 ] .",
    "they reduce to @xmath319 for @xmath320 , one sometimes has to eliminate more than one box at a convex corner .",
    "for instance , at @xmath312 , we find the reduction @xmath321 the number of black dots in a diagram is the m2-brane number @xmath47 ( @xmath322 in this case ) from the blended young diagram for @xmath312 . on the left / right side ,",
    "the discrete torsions are @xmath323 where the bold - faced numbers are for anti m2-branes .",
    "the general rule that we find for eliminating the boxes from convex corners is to remove the maximal number of boxes without removing any box which contains a black dot .",
    "having studied the vacua of this theory , it is then of interest to study the elementary excitations . in particular , we would first like to study the massive particles in various vacua , charged under the unbroken gauge group ( [ unbroken ] ) . when all t hooft coupling constants @xmath324 , @xmath325 are small , one can simply diagonalize the mass matrix to understand their spectrum classically .",
    "this is subject to quantum correction when some couplings are large . for the bps particles in the supersymmetric vacua with @xmath326",
    ", one may expect to understand or test some aspects of the gauge / gravity duals that we proposed in the previous sections without much difficulty , hopefully relying on the weakly coupled field theory results .",
    "however , even the bps spectrum should also be studied with care .",
    "the first signal for the subtlety is that the chern - simons theory with @xmath224 gauge group and level ( with @xmath9 supersymmetric uv completion given by yang - mills chern - simons theory ) is dual to nothing @xcite at low energy .",
    "this happens when the t hooft coupling becomes @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , naive classical spectrum for charged particles at small t hooft coupling should break down even for bps modes , whenever the relevant gauge group becomes @xmath327 .",
    "it is possible that the bps spectrum could be nontrivial for particles charged under @xmath328 when @xmath329 . on the other hand , in some strongly coupled regime",
    ", the seiberg like duality could allow one to study the spectra in dual descriptions with small coupling constants .",
    "turning to the charged particles from the gravity dual , it is natural to seek for such states from open m2-branes having two ends on fractional m2-branes in the background .",
    "in particular , we would like to have them wrap the ` m - theory circle ' which is subject to the @xmath1 orbifold . by doing so , the open m2-branes reduce to fundamental strings heading towards two @xmath11 singularities at large @xmath6 . near the tips of the orbifolds ,",
    "the world - volumes of open m2 s ending on fractional m2-branes will be locally same as the open membranes dual to w - bosons in the coulomb phase of conformal chern - simons - matter theories , studied in @xcite .    in section 4.1 , we study classical configurations for the probe open membranes preserving half of the supersymmetry ( 6 real ) .",
    "classically , their masses are given by the area of the membranes .",
    "there could in principle be subtle corrections from the two end points , over which we have little control",
    ". the classical analysis would be reliable when the membranes are macroscopic . in this case , one finds a good agreement with the results from weakly coupled field theory .",
    "see our section 4.1 for the subtle subleading terms and some comments on them .    in section 4.2",

    "the geometric realizations @xcite of holographic non - relativistic conformal symmetry do not appear to be relevant in our context , implying broader possibilities of holographic non - relativistic systems than those studied so far .      before presenting the analysis for the bps spectrum of charged particles",

    "detail on the tensor representations of the irreducible blocks is explained in appendix [ tensor ] .",
    "we first study the massive vectors modes , which acquire nonzero masses through higgs mechanism .",
    "we start by considering a classical vacuum containing an irreducible block of first type which is an @xmath335 matrix , and another block of first type which is an @xmath25 matrix .",
    "we find that the ` off - diagonal ' @xmath336 matrix in @xmath337 and the @xmath338 matrix in @xmath339 mix with each other in the gauss law , which becomes the classical equation of motion for massive vectors .",
    "the modes solving the gauss law equation , after an appropriate gauge - fixing for scalars to be eaten up by vectors , have following masses and representations under @xmath21 : @xmath340 where half - integral @xmath341 denotes the ` total angular momentum ' quantum number for @xmath21 , and an integer @xmath342 runs over @xmath343 .",
    "namely , there are two representations with given @xmath341 quantum number with different masses .",

    "let us seiberg - dualize all the gauge groups below the fermi level and label the fractional branes above / below the fermi level by @xmath372 as explained in section 2.3 , to go to the same duality frame as the field theory .",
    "for the open m2 connecting @xmath332th and @xmath30th fractional m2-branes above the fermi level ( with @xmath373 ) , the mass is given by @xmath374 upon identifying @xmath101 , the first two terms in the parenthesis agrees with the weakly coupled field theory spectrum .",
    "the last two terms are 1-loop corrections .",
    "we are not completely sure which of the two calculations are valid between classical field theory and gravity at this subleading level . strictly speaking ,",
    "both calculations are valid when @xmath375 : otherwise , as there are sectors of strongly coupled chern - simons theory both from field theory and gravity sides , both calculations might be unreliable .",

    "when all the requirements for the validity of gauge / gravity calculations are satisfied , we find that the two results agree with each other .    at this point , we should mention that there are examples in which bps masses receive quantum corrections at 1-loop level .",
    "in particular , in the context of chern - simons - matter theories , such a phenomenon is observed for bps vortices when a @xmath3 symmetry is broken , together with the same correction to the central charge .",
    "it is not clear whether this implies that subleading terms in ( [ gravity - mass ] ) should be seriously considered .",
    "more comments about the exact bps spectrum is given at the end of this subsection , and also in the discussion section .",
    "similar analysis for the charged particles can be done for the open m2 s connecting fractional m2-branes below the fermi level .",

    "the last case to discuss is the modes connecting @xmath332th fractional m2-brane above the fermi level , and @xmath30th fractional m2-brane below the fermi level . repeating the analysis above",
    ", one obtains the following mass from the classical m2-branes : @xmath377 comparing with the field theory spectrum @xmath378 , we first find a discrepancy proportional to the t hooft couplings , which can be ignored in the weak coupling limit . even after ignoring this part",
    ", another difference is that the field theory spectrum has @xmath63 compared to the classical gravity result .",
    "this is again subleading in the limit @xmath379 in which classical membrane analysis is reliable , again implying agreement between the two calculations .",
    "again it could be that the last subleading @xmath63 discrepancy between the field theory and gravity may have to be considered seriously , and one may want to clarify which of the two calculations has to be refined . as the field theory calculation is obviously reliable when t hooft couplings are small",
    ", we suspect that classical gravity calculation has to be corrected , perhaps by taking into account some effects from the boundary of open m2-branes .",
    "a similar subleading discrepancy was observed in the conformal @xmath0 chern - simons - matter theory , in the study of the field theory dual of giant m2-brane torus .",
    "the last object can be regarded as open strings connecting spherical d2-brane dual giant gravitons @xcite , somewhat similar to our open m2 s as they are connecting spherically polarized m5-branes in the probe limit @xcite .    as shown in appendix [ susy - gravity ] , the open m2-branes localized on @xmath355 base of @xmath356 are @xmath177-bps . on the other hand , as we smear the open m2-branes along the transverse 2-sphere , one only obtains @xmath351-bps solutions .",
    "the supersymmetry of the gravity and field theory sides thus agree with each other .",
    "we remark that we have not clarified the degeneracies of various bps particles from the gravity dual .",
    "one point which could be important is that open membranes are transverse to one of the two 2-spheres spanned by either @xmath21 or @xmath22 r - symmetries . by examining the 4-form flux of ( [ llm ] )",
    ", we find that open m2 s effectively behave as charged particles moving on @xmath380 in nonzero magnetic fields .",
    "there are nontrivial degeneracies from the lowest magnetic monopole spherical harmonics",
    ". it could be possible to understand the degeneracies from the gravity dual in this way , which we leave as a future work .",
    "another point worth a consideration is that the gravity solution does not see the ` fermi level ' at all . before performing seiberg - like dualities for some fractional m2-branes in section 2.3 ,",
    "all fractional m2-branes are described by @xmath222 type chern - simons theories , where @xmath65 is the torsion at each orbifold fixed point .",
    "we have performed seiberg - like dualities for the chern - simons theories living below the fermi level of the droplet , to compare the gravity result with the field theory . the field theory in the last seiberg - duality frame is weakly coupled when all @xmath33 , @xmath34 are much smaller than @xmath6 . in the gravity viewpoint , this means that the quantized lengths of all black regions above the fermi level are much smaller than @xmath6 , while the lengths of all white regions below the fermi level are smaller than @xmath6 .",
    "so the notion of fermi level emerges just by demanding the field theory be weakly coupled in a particular duality frame . at the full non - perturbative level , we think the field theory should also be ignorant about the fermi level . to test this , one could rely on localization methods to calculate the partition function ( or index ) of all bps particles .",
    "similar to the instanton partition functions @xcite in 5 dimensional yang - mills theories compactified on a circle , we may introduce an omega deformation with the @xmath381 rotation on spatial part of @xmath112 to lift the translational zero modes of these particles .",
    "this partition function would include contributions from various vortices @xcite as well as elementary particles .",
    "such a calculation could also resolve the puzzle raised in @xcite about the zero modes ( or more precisely ground state degeneracies ) of vortices .",
    "the massive charged particles studied in the previous section are subject to various conservations of @xmath3 charges .",
    "in particular , the overall @xmath3 factors in the @xmath382 or @xmath383 type gauge groups turn out to be important when @xmath384 . as",
    "various massive particles are bi - fundamental in two factors of such unitary groups , the charge of a particle under a given @xmath3 is either @xmath63 , @xmath57 or @xmath64 .    in the symmetric vacuum , with @xmath385 in our notation ,",
    "a non - relativistic limit was considered in @xcite which discards ` anti - particle modes ' which are negatively charged under the baryon - like @xmath386 .",
    "see also @xcite for further discussions on this theory . as @xmath386 is the global part of the difference between two overall @xmath3 s in @xmath12 @xcite",
    ", @xmath386 is a special combination of many @xmath3 s in the general higgs vacua mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "similar non - relativistic limits can be taken in the higgs vacua that we have been discussing , in which scalar expectation values are nonzero . with various overall @xmath3 factors",
    ", one can keep the modes with definite signs of charges under various @xmath3 s and take a non - relativistic limit similar to @xcite . in the bosonic sector , one would obtain non - relativistic kinetic terms and quartic interaction terms of various modes . this system would have a scale symmetry with dynamical exponent @xmath387 .",
    "it should also have galilean boost symmetry as well as the symmetries analogous to particle number @xmath3 mentioned above . in @xcite , the non - relativistic system also has time special conformal symmetry .",
    "this appears when the relative coefficients of the chern - simons term , kinetic term and the quartic interactions are fine tuned .",
    "the general non - relativistic system from the higgs vacua could also have this symmetry , although we have not performed this analysis .",
    "the particle number - like @xmath3 symmetries are realized in the bulk as part of the gauge symmetry localized on fractional m2-branes .",
    "note that this is in contrast to @xcite , in which an isometry of a spacetime direction is used to realize the particle number symmetry .",
    "this is because our gravity solutions for mass - deformed m2-branes do not fully geometrize the m2-brane charges into flux , but leave some of them as fractional m2-branes .",
    "we expect that other part of non - relativistic symmetries will not be geometrically realized , either .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , other symmetries also have nontrivial actions along the direction which realizes particle number isometry .",
    "our system is also different from another recently studied non - geometric realization of the particle number @xcite , as our particle symmetry lives in @xmath388 dimensions .",
    "after the suggestion of @xcite on the gravity duals of non - relativistic conformal systems , there have been some attempts to obtain such solutions arising from mass - deformed m2-branes @xcite , having the symmetric vacuum theory of @xcite in mind .",
    "these works sought for solutions with some supersymmetry , and also with the @xmath330 isometry as a gravity dual of the r - symmetry of the @xmath0 system .",
    "firstly , if one is studying the symmetric vacuum , one would have to study solutions with broken supersymmetry , as the field theory vacuum breaks supersymmetry for @xmath290 . also , the reason why @xmath330 symmetry is imposed in @xcite is because @xmath389 r - symmetry of the field theory at @xmath8 is reduced to @xmath390 for general @xmath6 .",
    "if this reduction of symmetry happens by a @xmath1 orbifold from the gravity dual like the solutions in this paper , then the ansatz one should consider is much more restrictive than those considered in @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to see if such a strong restriction would help us find non - supersymmetric gravity solutions .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that @xmath1 quotients of the polarized m2-brane solutions of @xcite are dual to the supersymmetric vacua of the mass - deformed @xmath0 chern - simons - matter theories , after taking fractional m2-branes and strong coupling chern - simons dynamics into account .",
    "as the gravity duals that we found in this paper have rich structures , we think this model can be studied for various purposes",
    ". in particular , it would be very interesting to see if we can extend or refine the studies on quantum hall systems based on conformal chern - simons - matter theories @xcite , to the theories with mass gap .",
    "the latter should be desirable as the quantum hall systems are gapped in the bulk .",
    "also , it would be interesting to study various interface or defect configurations which support stable massless charged states at edges . @xmath391 and @xmath392 branes are used in cft - based models @xcite . as the mass - deformed geometry also has topological 4-cycles , m5-branes wrapping them",
    "would naturally provide @xmath60 dimensional defects in @xmath112 . due to the presence of nonzero magnetic flux on such cycles",
    ", one has to attach m2-branes to the defect for tadpole cancelation of the 3-form world - volume field .",
    "these tadpole m2-branes are extended along half of @xmath112 , having the defect as their boundaries .",
    "as explained in this paper with elementary excitations , studies of bps particles in this theory expose rich structures and various subtleties .",
    "although the leading energies for macroscopic open membranes agree with elementary excitation masses , we think it could be important to understand the exact spectrum from both sides .",
    "another type of subtlety in the bps spectrum was found in @xcite in the studies of vortex solitons and d0-branes in the gravity dual .",
    "namely , it has been shown that the dimensions of moduli spaces of the dual objects apparently seem to disagree , where the field theory and gravity show complex @xmath7 and @xmath393 dimensional moduli , respectively .",
    "this difference would yield different ground state degeneracies after quantization . to get an exact result for the spectrum of bps particles in the field theory side",
    ", one can try a localization calculation for the index for these bps states , similar to the instanton partition function counting bps bound states of 5 dimensional supersymmetric yang - mills theories @xcite .",
    "as discussed in section 3.2 , it may not be too difficult to seek for the gravity solutions with non - relativistic conformal symmetry dual to the symmetric vacuum , breaking supersymmetry .    for @xmath394 supersymmetric mass - deformed chern - simons - matter theories ,",
