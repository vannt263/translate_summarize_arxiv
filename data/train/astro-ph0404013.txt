    "gravitational lenses of distant quasars are quite useful in cosmological and astrophysical studies , such as measuring the hubble constant from time delays @xcite , studies of galaxy formation and evolution , and direct probes of galaxy structure , including cold dark - matter substructures .",
    "the method used to measure the hubble constant does not rely on the distance ladder , which inevitably suffers various systematic errors .",
    "after the discovery of the first lens system , q 0957 + 561 @xcite , many lens systems have been studied in detail , adopting various lens models .",
    "however , the model uncertainties , including several intrinsic degeneracies @xcite , prevent us from accurately deriving the hubble constant ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    among several applications of gravitational lenses ,",
    "flux - ratio anomalies have attracted much attention .",
    "there are mainly three explanations for them : effects of the interstellar medium , problems in smooth models , and lensing by the substructure ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while substructure lensing is often regarded as being the best explanation for the flux anomalies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the former two explanations have not yet been sufficiently investigated to reach the conclusion that the flux - ratio anomalies are connected with the substructure .",
    "the limitation comes from the fact that it is difficult to apply all of the models , which are physical and complicated , to the observed lens systems .",
    "in addition , since galaxies are believed to consist of not only luminous matter , but also dark matter , the shapes of lens galaxies do not have to be elliptical , nor other simple shapes , as the isophotes indicate .",
    "therefore , it is of great importance to investigate the contribution of many forms of the angular structure of the lens potential to find the true origin of the flux anomalies .",
    "indeed , @xcite showed that some of lens systems that have been claimed to be lenses with flux anomalies can be well fitted by a smooth lens model using a power - law fourier potential ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "kochanek and dalal ( 2003 ) studied the contribution of only the isothermal @xmath2 and @xmath3 multipoles to the flux ratio anomalies reported so far .",
    "we then reinvestigate some of the systems with not only multipoles , but also several types of external perturbations .",
    "our aim in this paper is to discuss the contribution of both multipoles of the primary lens galaxy and external perturbation of the group , in particular the @xmath0 terms that are not usually included in lens modeling .",
    "we consider whether some multipoles can produce an acceptable fit without substructure or not .",
    "we also discuss the quadruple lens system b0712 + 472 in detail because of the interesting observations that the ellipticity of the galaxy and the shear of the group seem to be significantly misaligned ( @xmath4 ) to each other , and that previous authors estimated the shear to be small compared to observations using the one - shear model @xcite . since more than three images are necessary to constrain the mass models strongly , we restrict our considerations to four quadruple lens systems ( pg 1115 + 080 , b1422 + 231 , b0712 + 472 , and b2045 + 265 ) .",
    "there are three reasons for this restriction .",
    "first , the existence of a substructure of the lens systems has been claimed to account for the observed flux ratios ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "second , there are no satellite galaxies that complicate the lens model .",
    "third , there are sufficient astrometric , photometric , and spectroscopic ( redshift ) data . in this paper",
    ", we consider only isothermal models ; however our analysis can be easily extended to non - isothermal radial mass profiles .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : modelmethod ] , we describe the models that we used to investigate four systems . in section [ sec : results ] , we show how we applied the models to four systems and give the results .",
    "we finally discuss the results and give conclusions in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the linear method that we used is presented in appendix [ app : linear ] .",
    "a source at @xmath5 and an image @xmath6 at @xmath7 are related through the lens equation , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the projected lens potential .",
    "thus , the magnification factor is given by @xmath10^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can also calculate the equation of the relative time delay between image @xmath6 and @xmath11 using @xmath12 , \\label{eq : tij}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the redshift of the lens object and @xmath14 is the speed of light ; @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the angular diameter distances to the lens , to the source , and from the lens to the source , respectively ; @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional poisson equation relates the dimensionless density distribution @xmath19 to the lens potential as @xmath20      for the potential of the primary lens galaxy , we apply the singular isothermal elliptical density ( sied ) model and/or the power - law fourier potential ( plf ; @xcite ; evans , witt 2003 ) model .",
    "the former model may be called the `` standard '' model in the sense that it is widely used in the mass modeling of a lens galaxy .",
    "the two - dimensional density profile of sied is given , in the cartesian coordinates @xmath21 centered on the primary lens galaxy , as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mass parameter that characterizes the einstein radius and @xmath24 is the axis ratio .",
    "the ellipticity , @xmath25 , is given by @xmath26 .",
    "we used the latter model , plf , to investigate the contribution of multipoles , particularly an @xmath2 multipole , which is neglected in usual lens modelings of lens systems .",
    "in addition , this model has an advantage that we can apply a linear method ( appendix [ app : linear ] ) .",
    "the lens potential of the power - law fourier model is given by @xmath27 where a fourier expansion of the angular function @xmath28 is @xmath29 in polar coordinates @xmath30 .",
    "the variables @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the amplitude and the position angle of the multipole , respectively . in the present work , we considered only the case of @xmath33 , which has a similar radial profile as in sied , while the parameter @xmath34 can take values between 0 ( point mass ) and 2 ( mass sheet ) .",
    "while the influence of the galaxy group which embeds the primary lens galaxy should be taken into account ( e.g. , @xcite ) , detailed information on the density distribution of the group is uncertain in most cases .",
    "the potential near the lens galaxies is often described by a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) or the potential expanded around the center of the lens galaxy @xcite as @xmath35 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + r^3\\left[\\frac{1}{4}\\sigma \\sin(\\theta-\\theta_{\\sigma } ) -\\frac{1}{6}\\delta \\sin 3(\\theta-\\theta_{\\delta})\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + { \\cal o}(r^4 ) .",
    "\\label{eq : expert}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first three terms can not be fully constrained by observables , because of the lens degeneracies @xcite .",
    "thus , one usually uses an external shear ( xs ) , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in the present work",
    ", we also added the terms of third order ( @xmath39 ) to the lens potential in a similar way of e.g. , bernstein and fischer ( 1999 ) enforcing @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( as for a singular isothermal group ) . in this case , the explicit expression of the additional potential ( x3 ) is @xmath42 .",
    "\\label{eq : x3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in summary , we used sis , sied , and plf models for the primary lens galaxy , and xs , sis , or ( xs+x3 ) models for the group .",
    "we used image positions and flux ratios as constraints on the lens models .",
    "the relative time delays between images were used not only for determining the hubble constant , but also for additional constraints on the lens models .",
    "the number of constraints was more than ten for a quadruple lens system , while the typical number of model parameters is equal to or more than seven .",
    "the goodness of fit was determined by @xmath1 statistics based on the image positions , the flux ratios , and the relative time delays : @xmath43 in the above equations , @xmath7 are the observed image positions , @xmath44 are the observed flux ratios , and @xmath45 are the observed relative time delays . the suffix `` ( model ) '' indicates the model predictions for each observable .",
    "the uncertainties in the observables are represented by @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "we minimized the total chi - square , @xmath49 @xcite , to obtain the best - fit parameters , @xmath50 . in this",
    "fitting , ( i ) we solved non - linear lens equations to derive the model predictions for the image positions , ( ii ) calculated the relative time delays and the flux ratios from the predicted image positions and the model parameters , and ( iii ) evaluated and minimized @xmath51 .",
    "finally , we evaluated the reduced chi - square , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the number of degrees of freedom . in the case of the plf model , the @xmath1 minimization",
    "was significantly simplified because of the linearity of the equations ( see appendix [ app : linear ] ) .",
    "about 80 gravitational - lens systems have been reported so far .",
    "one third of them are quadruple - lens systems , and the rest are double - lens systems . however , we considered only quadruple lens systems , because more than six observables are typically needed to strongly constrain lens models .",
    "specifically , we analyzed the systems pg 1115 + 080 @xcite , b1422 + 231 @xcite , b0712 + 472 @xcite , and b2045 + 265 @xcite .",
    "we adopted a flat lambda - dominated universe with @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the density parameter of matter and @xmath56 is the dimensionless cosmological constant .",
    "the hubble constant in units of @xmath57 km s@xmath58 mpc@xmath58 is denoted by @xmath59 , as usual .",
    "the positions and fluxes of most of the gravitationally lensed images are relatively well constrained within 10 mas and about five percent uncertainties , respectively , while measuring time delays from light curves are very difficult . for most of the systems",
    ", we used the data of the image positions and the fluxes by the cfa / arizona space telescope lens survey ( castles ; @xcite ) , and for some of the systems the data was taken from the papers cited below .",
    "the uncertainties of the flux ratios were slightly broadened ( see below ) to account for possible systematics , such as possible microlensing ( e.g. , @xcite ) , extinction , and quasar variability during a time delay .",
    "the system pg 1115 + 080 is a qso ( @xmath60 ) gravitationally lensed by an early - type galaxy of @xmath61 , which looks very spherical @xcite .",
    "the lens galaxy belongs to a group of galaxies .",
    "the qso images consist of four components ( fold - type ) with the maximum angular separation of 2.32 arcsec . in order to constrain models",
    ", we used the castles data of the image positions and the fluxes , and @xcite s analysis of the time delays .",
    "the flux uncertainties were broadened to 20% .",
    "the second system , b1422 + 231 , that we analyzed is known as a system with possible substructure microlensing @xcite . the elongated galaxy ( @xmath62 ) associated with a poor group gravitationally lenses a qso ( @xmath63 ) , and leads to a cusp - type four - imaged system .",
    "the ellipticity , @xmath25 , of the galaxy is @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "there are radio data of this system ( @xcite , 1999 ) , having uncertainties of 50 @xmath65arcsec for qso images and a few percents for their fluxes .",
    "some other observational properties , such as the effects of the lyman @xmath66 @xcite and the variability @xcite , have been observed .",
    "we used the data of @xcite , assuming flux uncertainties of 5% .",
    "we also investigated an interesting system b0712 + 472 @xcite .",
    "the redshifts of the elongated primary lens galaxy and the source qso are @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "interestingly , the primary lens galaxy is not associated with a group of galaxies , but a foreground group with a mean redshifts of @xmath69 are overlapped @xcite .",
    "the light distribution of the galaxy is very elongated with an ellipticity of between @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",

    "the two methods can be combined in the case of @xmath33 ; first one estimates the external shear with the former and then applies the latter to the considered system in order to reproduce the flux ratios _ without _ assuming the external shear .",
    "however , this combined method sometimes suffers from results of unphysical galaxy shapes , such as cross - like ones .",

    "<S> in modeling strong gravitational lens systems , one often adopts simple models , such as singular isothermal elliptical density plus lowest - order external perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> however , such simple models may mislead us if the real mass distribution is more complicated than that in the assumed models . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , assumptions on mass models are crucial in studying flux ratio anomalies that have been suggested as evidence for a cold dark - matter substructure . </S>",
    "<S> we reinvestigated four quadruple lens systems using power - law fourier models , which have advantages of clear physical meanings and the applicability of a linear method , as well as a simple singular isothermal elliptical density model . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigated the effect of external perturbations , including a singular isothermal sphere , lowest - order expansion , and next - order expansion . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the @xmath0 terms of the primary galaxy and/or of external perturbation significantly reduce the @xmath1 in pg 1115 + 080 and b1422 + 231 . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , we could reproduce the flux ratios of b1422 + 231 with next - order external perturbation assuming 5% flux uncertainties , suggesting that external perturbation can not be described by a simple singular isothermal sphere approximation . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , we could not fit b0712 + 472 and b2045 + 265 very well even with our models , although the @xmath1 were reduced compared with the case of using simple models . </S>",
    "<S> our results clearly demonstrate that both the primary lens galaxy and the external perturbation are often more complicated than we usually assume . </S>"
