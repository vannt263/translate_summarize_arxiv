    "the supernova remnant cassiopeia a has long intrigued astonomers across the entire electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "long known as the brightest radio source in the northern sky @xcite , it has also recently been detected in tev @xmath2 rays @xcite , and is most likely the remnant of a putative supernova observed as a 6th magnitude star by flamsteed in 1680 .",
    "the discovery of hard x - ray continuum emission extending out to 100 kev has stimulated interest in electron acceleration in its shock waves . as discussed in a recent paper @xcite , the original interpretation of this emission as synchrotron radiation from highly relativistic electrons @xcite deserves further study .",
    "unlike in the cases of sn 1006 @xcite , g347.3 - 0.5 @xcite , and now also g266.1 - 1.2 @xcite , where the x - ray continuum is strong enough to completely mask the line emission that should also be present , the continuum in cas a is merely a high energy `` tail '' to the otherwise maxwellian thermal bremsstrahlung continuum , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "( figure 1 also shows some models discussed in detail below ) .",
    "it is thus possible that such emission could be the result of electrons accelerated by collisionless processes other than first order fermi acceleration at shock fronts .",
    "such a scenario is possible because the shock transition occurs on a length scale much shorter than particle mean free paths to coulomb collisions . assuming that the gas pressure @xmath3 magnetic pressure in the downstream plasma , the temperature @xmath4 reached by particle species @xmath5 with mass @xmath6 is given by conservation of energy , momentum and particles across the shock discontinuity by @xmath7 for shock velocity @xmath8 .",
    "thus in the limit of true collisionless plasma , the particles will have temperatures proportional to their masses , i.e. protons will have a temperature @xmath9 times that of the electrons .",
    "obviously in realistic conditions coulomb equilibration will take place , with rate ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also appendix b ) @xmath10 in c.g.s .",
    "units , where @xmath11 , and the ions have charge @xmath12 and atomic mass @xmath13",
    ". however collisionless processes involving the generation of plasma waves at the shock front and the associated electron heating by landau damping or stochastic processes can operate on a much faster timescale",
    ". recent simulations of such processes are given by @xcite and @xcite for quasi perpendicular shocks ( magnetic field in the plane of the shock front ) and by @xcite for a quasi parallel shock ( magnetic field parallel to shock velocity vector ) , where shock heated electron distributions characterized by maxwellians at low energies going over into power law distributions at high energies are frequently seen .",
    "although these results appear qualitatively consistent with the observed x - ray spectra of cas a , the situation is complicated by the fact that optical @xcite and uv @xcite diagnostics for collisionless electron heating at fast shocks ( admittedly in other supernova remnants , tycho and sn 1006 ) give essentially no electron heating beyond that implied by the shock jump conditions , equation ( [ eqn1.1 ] ) .",
    "similar results have been found in x - ray spectra for e0102.2 - 7219 @xcite , sn 1987a @xcite , and sn 1993j @xcite .",
    "@xcite speculated that the extrapolation involved from the modest mach numbers ( of order 1 - 10 ) of the simulated shocks to the very high ( @xmath14 ) mach numbers for forward and reverse shocks in supernova remnants might not be valid .",
    "the reasoning behind this is that the higher mach number shocks become progressively more turbulent ( c.f .",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although this appears to have no effect on the simulations , these have only one spatial dimension . in two or three dimensions",
    "the conjecture is that the shock reflected ions , while still quasi - monoenergetic , no longer behave as a `` beam '' , now having a much larger distribution in pitch angle .",
    "the consequence of this is that the preshock instabilities heating the electrons are now no longer reactive in nature but kinetic , and have growth rates low enough that insignificant wave growth and hence electron heating can occur before the preshock plasma is overrun by the shock front itself .",
    "reactive and kinetic instabilities are discussed more fully in appendix a.1 .",
    "for this reason @xcite investigated a slightly different mechanism ; the excitation of lower hybrid waves and their consequent acceleration of electrons as a result of secondary shocks passing through the presumed region of strong magnetic field in cas a. lower hybrid waves are electrostatic ion oscillations , which can occur in magnetic fields strong enough that the electron gyroradius is smaller than the lower hybrid wavelength . due to this necessary magnetization of the electrons ,",
    "the waves propagate preferentially across magnetic field lines .",
    "the parallel component of the wavevector @xmath15 . since @xmath16",
    "the wave can simultaneously be in resonance with ions moving across the magnetic field and electrons moving along magnetic field lines , which facilitates collisionless energy exchange between ions and electrons on timescales much faster than that associated with coulomb collisions . a cold plasma theory for lower - hybrid waves",
    "is given in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "they have also been previously discussed in connection with cometary x - ray emission , supernova remnant shock waves and advection dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) @xcite , and observed in situ together with accelerated electrons at halley s comet @xcite .",
    "lower hybrid waves are especially attractive to consider due to the strong magnetic fields inferred to exist in cas a ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , near the contact discontinuity between ambient circumstellar material shocked by the blast wave and supernova ejecta heated by the reverse shock .",
    "the situation is shown schematically in figure 2 .",
    "the explosion drives a blast wave into the surrounding circumstellar medium . as this begins to sweep up more plasma behind it and decelerates , a reverse shock develops which moves back into the ejecta ( in a lagrangian sense",
    "; it is still expanding in eulerian coordinates ) , with a contact discontinuity between the reverse shocked ejecta and forward shocked circumstellar medium .",
    "the dense shocked ejecta being decelerated by the much less dense shocked circumstellar medium is subject to a rayleigh - taylor instability , which is the likely mechanism for the magnetic field amplification .",
    "also shown in figure 2 are two of the various classes of knots or clumps of material in cas a that are particularly conspicuous in optical observations .",
    "quasi - stationary floculli ( qsfs ) are seen ahead of the forward shock and fast moving knots ( fmks ) ahead of the reverse shock . as these shocks",
    "run into the density contrasts represented by these structures , they split into a transmitted shock that propagates through the clump and eventually destroys it , and a reflected shock that moves back towards the contact discontinuity .",
    "it is these reflected shocks that in our model generate the lower hybrid waves and accelerated electrons in the high magnetic field region .    in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis of @xcite to more realistic thermal plasma conditions in cas a. these are taken from time dependent ionization balance calculations based on analytic expressions for the hydrodynamics from @xcite , and updated in @xcite .",
    "section 2 develops the plasma theory for lower hybrid waves in thermal conditions .",
    "section 3 describes the ionization balance calculations with and without the extra collisionless electron heating .",
    "since the mechanism depends on having strong magnetic fields in the shell of cas a , amplified presumably from seed fields by a rayleigh - taylor instability , the history of which over the lifetime of the remnant is presently unknown , it is not possible to calculate definitively the hard x - ray spectrum .",
    "however if this model is basically correct , a number of inferences can be made about the nature of the plasma in cas a , and these are discussed in section 4 , followed by conclusions in section 5 .",
    "many of the mathematical details in section 2 and 3 are given in the appendices .",
    "in a previous paper @xcite a theory of the growth of lower - hybrid waves was described in the cold plasma approximation ( i.e. where the wave frequency @xmath17 and the electron cyclotron frequency @xmath18 ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the electron and ion thermal velocities respectively ) , where ions reflected from shocks propagating throughout the shell of cas a generate waves through a modified two stream instability at a perpendicular shock . in this case , waves moving at angle @xmath21 to the magnetic field direction given by @xmath22 are preferentially excited , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the ion and electron plasma frequencies respectively .",
    "this is because waves at this angle have a group velocity away from the shock equal to the shock velocity itself @xcite , and hence stay in contact with the shock reflected ions for arbitrary lengths of time .",
    "this allows large wave amplitudes to develop , even though the growth rates may be small .",
    "these waves are excited by ions _ returning _ to the shock front with velocity @xmath25 directed along to shock velocity vector .",
    "as the shock becomes quasi - parallel this feature disappears , since the wave group velocity is no longer in the same direction as the shock velocity .",
    "the generalization of this theory for thermal electrons and ions is given in appendix a. where @xmath26 , it is found that outgoing ions can now excite the necessary waves , propagating at direction cosines essentially the same as those found in the cold plasma limit for the returning ions , i.e. @xmath27 . in the opposite case , @xmath28 ,",
    "again only returning ions can excite the waves , but for a given wavevector do so at a variety of small direction cosines .    in the hot ion limit ( @xmath29 )",
    "waves can be generated with a range of direction cosines and frequencies , so we now proceed to determine the wave direction cosine and frequency at which the net growth rate is maximized in this limit .",
    "the growth rate due to a maxwellian ion distribution moving with bulk velocity @xmath30 in the limit @xmath29 is given by a generalization of equation ( a12 ) of @xcite , which we reproduce here , @xmath31,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the bessel function of the first kind of order zero and @xmath36 is the electron gyrofrequency .",

    "since @xmath41 , we may put @xmath42 and find @xmath43 for which @xmath44 is maximized . substituting for @xmath45 in terms of @xmath46 in the expression for @xmath44 ,",
    "we find @xmath47 setting this equal to zero we find maxima or minima of @xmath46 given by the cubic equation where @xmath48 , with @xmath8 the shock velocity and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the angle between @xmath51 and @xmath52 ; @xmath53 + \\omega ^2\\left[{2kv_s\\over\\alpha } { n_i^{\\prime}\\over n_i}\\exp\\left(-m^2/\\alpha ^2\\right)\\right]\\\\+ & \\omega\\left[\\left({k^2v_s^2\\over\\alpha ^2}-2k^2v_i^2\\right){n_i^{\\prime}\\over n_i}\\exp \\left(-m^2/\\alpha ^2\\right)-2k^2v_i^2)\\right ] - { kv_s\\over\\alpha } k^2v_i^2{n_i^{\\prime}\\over n_i}\\exp\\left(-m^2/\\alpha ^2\\right)=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 , the mach number divided by @xmath55 . for @xmath56",
    "this has two solutions at @xmath57 corresponding to minima and a maximum at @xmath58 .",

    "@xmath67 , since the electron gyroradius must be shorter than the wavelength for lower hybrid waves . then for @xmath68 the growth rate is @xmath69 rad s@xmath70 . for @xmath71",
    "the growth rate is 2 orders of magnitude lower .",
    "thus for @xmath72 the growth rates are of order @xmath73 rad s@xmath70 for plasma parameters similar to those in figure 8 ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 corresponding to @xmath77 mg ) .",

    "we have calculated wave dispersion relations and kinetic growth rates in each of the limits @xmath90 and @xmath29 .",
    "since these growth rates are in general lower than the ion cyclotron frequency , @xmath91 , we also calculate the group velocity of the waves , and by setting this equal to the shock velocity find the angle to the magnetic field at which propagating waves can remain in contact with the shock reflected ions and hence grow to large amplitudes over essentially arbitrary periods of time . for these waves",
    "we calculate the growth rates and hence densities of accelerated electrons .",
    "we have revised the velocity range over accelerated electrons may exist from @xmath92 in @xcite to @xmath82 due to the following consideration .",
    "@xcite has derived a value for the maximum electric field above which the wave becomes stochastic and ion heating also commences , given by @xmath93 . the kinetic energy acquired by an electron in time @xmath94 ,",
    "( the time available for electron acceleration in the precursor before the shock hits ) is @xmath95 , which for relevant values of @xmath61 and @xmath43 evaluates to energies less than 1 kev for cas a. this is valid for a true perpendicular shock .",
    "however it is easy to see that an electron traveling along a magnetic field line inclined at a small angle to the shock front ( a quasi - perpendicular shock ) can easily stay ahead of the shock and be accelerated to large energies , but may do so traveling in one direction only .",
    "the calculation of the accelerated electron distribution function assumes that the electrons are accelerated purely by landau damping of the lower hybrid wave , which is likely to be the case for the non - relativistic electrons envisaged here . however",
    "since lower hybrid waves exist with @xmath96 , electrons can in principle be accelerated to relativistic energies , if they can be trapped in the wave generation region for long enough .",
    "@xcite argue that this is indeed the case for quite a wide range of shock alfvn mach numbers , based on the intensity at which lower hybrid waves saturate in simulations and the resulting value of the momentum diffusion coefficient for electrons , and that lower - hybrid waves may provide an electron injection mechanism for subsequent fermi shock acceleration to cosmic ray energies .",
    "we model the hydrodynamics for the cas a shell assuming uniform density ejecta and ambient medium .",
    "we use expressions given by @xcite for the reverse shock radius and velocity with respect to the expanding ejecta , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , which connect between the early ejecta dominated , and late sedov - taylor limiting behavior .",
    "the generalization of such models to non - uniform densities is given in @xcite .",
    "we choose parameters for the hydrodynamic models of cas a as follows .",
    "the blast wave velocity is inferred to be 5200 km s@xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the expansion factor ( @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the radius of the blast wave ) found by these authors to be @xmath101 suggests that the remnant is slightly more than midway through the transition between the ejecta dominated and sedov - taylor dominated phases , where values of @xmath102 of 1.0 and 0.4 respectively would be expected .",
    "hence we expect @xmath103 pc and @xmath104 years , the transition blast wave radius and time @xcite , to be similar to or perhaps slightly smaller than the current values , 2.64 pc and 320 years respectively . in these relations @xmath105 is the preshock hydrogen density , @xmath106 is the explosion energy in units of @xmath107 ergs , and @xmath108 is the ejecta mass in units of the solar mass . the ionization age for this shock front",
    "is determined to be in the range @xmath109 @xmath110s , @xcite , which combined with the age of 320 years gives a preshock electron density of 2.5 - 5.0 @xmath110 , assuming a shock compression of a factor of 4 .",
    "taking @xmath111 pc gives @xmath108 in the range 4 - 8 .",
    "assuming @xmath112 years gives @xmath106 in the range 2.4 - 4.8 . from asca observations ,",
    "@xcite find @xmath113 .",
    "@xcite analyzing bepposax spectra find @xmath114 , with the uncertainty stemming from different assumptions about the role of the non - thermal continuum .",
    "the small ejecta mass is consistent with extensive mass loss as stellar winds by the progenitor .",
    "both references find o to be the dominant element composing the ejecta , with rather little of the expected products of o burning evident , suggesting further that these are confined in a compact stellar remnant .",
    "the emission measure quoted by @xcite corresponds to 4@xmath115 of o ( if @xmath116 @xmath110 ) , so in the following we will take @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 @xmath110 .",
    "this values are similar to those considered by @xcite , with the exception of a smaller @xmath105 .",
    "it appears that they chose @xmath105 consistent with the modeling of @xcite , who modeled the deceleration of the blast wave upon encountering a shell of circumstellar material postulated to be at the interface of red and blue supergiant presupernova winds , in order to match the measured radio expansion of @xmath120 km s@xmath70 .",
    "the more rapid expansion seen in x - rays @xcite , generally assumed to be more directly associated with the actual motion of the plasma , suggests a lower circumstellar density as used here .",
    "@xcite do demonstrate in their simulations one important feature relevant in this work , namely the fact that the blast wave ( and presumably also the reverse shock ) split into transmitted and reflected shocks upon encountering density contrasts , and that these secondary shocks will propagate back across the presumed region of high magnetic field near the contact discontinuity .    the blast wave of cas a is observed at a radius of 160  , while the bright ring of x - ray emission is at a radius of 110  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the bright ring is in fact emission from the ejecta heated by the reverse shock , since according to the self - similar models of @xcite , for a blast wave radius of 160  , the radius of the contact discontinuity should be in the range 120-140  . behind the reverse shock , the density @xmath121 of ions with charge @xmath122 is given by @xmath123 \\label{eqn1}\\ ] ] where @xmath124 are the rates for electron impact ionization , radiative recombination and dielectronic recombination respectively , out of the charge state @xmath122 .",
    "these rates are the same as those used in the recent ionization balance calculations of @xcite , using subroutines kindly supplied by dr p. mazzotta ( private communication 2000 ) .",
    "the electron density @xmath125 is determined from the condition that the plasma be electrically neutral .",
    "the ion and electron temperatures , @xmath126 and @xmath127 are given by generalizations of equation ( 2 ) for the case when many charge states of a particular element are present ( see appendix b ) @xmath128 and @xmath129 here @xmath13 is the atomic mass of the ions in the plasma .",
    "the last term @xmath130 represents plasma energy losses due to ionization and radiation .",
    "radiation losses are taken from @xcite .",
    "these authors tabulate the power emitted by _",
    "each ion _ of the elements c , o , si , ar , fe and mo as a function of temperature , allowing an exact treatment of the ionization non - equilibrium aspect of the power losses for these elements .",
    "losses for other elements can be readily obtained by interpolation along isoelectronic sequences . at each time step @xmath126 and @xmath127",
    "are modified by a further factor @xmath131 and @xmath125 and the @xmath121 by @xmath132 , coming from the adiabatic expansion of a spherical shell of plasma with volume @xmath133 where @xmath134 is held constant as @xmath135 increases . in this approximation , @xmath136 , the expansion velocity , which is constant for all ejecta ,",
    "is given by the lesser of @xmath137 and @xmath138 , with @xmath139 being the reverse shock onset time , and @xmath140 being the blast wave velocity .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation for the transition period between ejecta dominated and sedov - taylor evolution in a supernova remnant ( see the  hollow  blast wave approximation in * ? ? ?",
    ". more detailed work could use the self similar solutions appropriate to the various regions and epochs of the remnant evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but even then the inevitable rayleigh - taylor instabilities are still difficult to treat .",
    "the radius @xmath135 of the plasma element is given by @xmath141 , and we neglect the fact that the rear side of cas a is around 4pc further away from us than the front side , and thus is observed about 13 years further back in time .",
    "equations ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) are integrated forwards in time from initial conditions given by the shock jump conditions , equation ( 1 ) , for the electron and ion temperatures and by the hydrodynamic model discussed above for the densities .",
    "all ions are assumed to be singly charged at the time of shock passage , and all ions of the same element are taken to have the same temperature .",
    "our results are insensitive to the exact initial charge state distribution since we are mainly interested in what happens many years after the initial postshock ionization has ceased . in comparisons with the calculations of @xcite for pure fe ejecta we found agreement to @xmath142% or better for time dependence of the electron temperature over the lifetime of cas a.      figure 3",
    "shows the evolution of the ion temperature ( dashed lines ) and the electron temperature ( solid lines ) for o ejecta heated by reverse shock encounters at various times in the evolution of cas a. the highest electron temperature , @xmath143 k is found in plasma shocked about 150 years after the supernova .",
    "table 1 gives a summary of the present day values of plasma parameters for different shells of the ejecta shocked at different times after the initial explosion . in table 2 , and illustrated in figure 4 are similar temperature plots but for circumstellar plasma with elemental composition dominated by n , he and h ( in mass ratios 0.02:0.49:0.49 respectively ) shocked by the blast wave . here",
    "the highest electron temperature is @xmath144 k , again for plasma shocked 150 years after explosion .",
    "this value for the electron temperature is consistent with that actually observed directly behind the blast wave ( u. hwang 2001 , private communication ) , but higher than that observed in spatially integrated spectra .",
    "however we believe that the reverse shocked ejecta is the dominant contributor to the observed x - ray emission .",
    "besides the morphological arguments given in the previous section , the blast wave as modeled does not provide enough emission measure to account for the observed emission by a factor of at least 4 , remembering that this plasma being composed of less highly charged ions radiates less bremsstrahlung per unit emission measure .",
    "although one could increase the circumstellar density and ejecta mass in the model to match the observations , the explosion energy would also have to be increased as well to to maintain the consistency with the observed blast wave velocity and radius .",
    "a problem might still remain however with the likely overproduction of o viii emission from the dense ejecta cooling at temperatures around @xmath145 k , compared with observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "only ejecta which encountered the reverse shock early in the evolution of cas a ( i.e. at times less than 100 years after explosion ) has sufficient emission measure to account for the observations .",
    "high values of the ion temperatures in our simulation result simply from the choice of the shock jump conditions , equation ( 1 ) , as our initial conditions . some observational support for very high postshock ion temperature exists .",
    "@xcite sees broad h @xmath146 profiles in optical spectra of tycho , rcw 86 and the cygnus loop , commensurate with the shock velocities derived in these remnants .",
    "further , @xcite observing the nw limb of sn 1006 in the uv see broad line profiles for c iv , n v , and o vi , indicating that the heavy ions have similar _ velocity _ distributions to each other and to the protons , and temperatures proportional to their masses consistent with equation ( 1 ) .",
    "so we proceed to place the dominant x - ray emission and the electron acceleration in the ejecta .",
    "one immediate , but easily solved problem is that according to the ionization balance calculations the temperature of the ejecta shocked at early times should be below @xmath145 k , not @xmath1 k as observed .",
    "however , if the hard x - rays are due to bremsstrahlung from suprathermal electrons , one should expect just such a temperature deficit in order to be able to accommodate the inevitable coulomb heating of the ambient plasma due to the accelerated electrons .",
    "cas a emits @xmath147 ergs s@xmath70 above 10 kev .",
    "the ratio of radiated bremsstrahlung power to that lost to coulomb collisions is given approximately by ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the bremsstrahlung gaunt factor , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 is the fine structure constant . for cas",
    "a , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 giving a ratio of @xmath155 .",
    "the nonthermal emission above 10 kev thus requires an energy input of @xmath156 ergs s@xmath70 , or a total energy input integrated over the lifetime of the remnant of @xmath157 ergs .",
    "the electron internal energy in an emission measure of @xmath158 @xmath110 for @xmath159 @xmath110 ( corresponding to ejecta shocked 50 and 100 years after explosion ) is @xmath160 ergs for a temperature of @xmath161 k. however the energy required to maintain this quantity of plasma at such temperature against energy losses from ionization , radiation and adiabatic expansion since the initial reverse shock encounter is more than this , @xmath157 ergs , similar in order of magnitude to that available for heating from the accelerated electrons .      to investigate further the effect of the coulomb heating of the ambient electrons by the accelerated population , we plot in figure 5 the time dependence of the electron and ion temperatures behind the reverse shock under various heating conditions .",
    "we assume a constant heat input per unit volume fixed at the present day value in ejecta reverse shocked about 50 years after the explosion , @xmath162 ergs s@xmath70@xmath110 , ( see appendix b.2 with @xmath163 and @xmath164 ) .",
    "this heating is taken to `` switch on '' at different times after reverse shock passage .",
    "these are taken to be 150 , 200 , 250 , and 300 years .",
    "a physical mechanism for such a `` switch on '' is suggested by the morphology of sn 1987a .",
    "the blast wave must encounter a strong density gradient before reflected shocks can travel back towards the contact discontinuity .",
    "thus a certain amount of time may elapse while the blast waves reaches this density gradient and the reflected shock propagates back . in sn 1987a the relevant density gradient",
    "would be provided by the inner edge of the presumed equatorial disk , the recombination radiation from which currently produces the inner ring . in cas a no real evidence for such an equatorial disk exists , but shock reflection from a distribution of quasi - stationary flocculi is the main possibility .",
    "> from figure 5 it is apparent that electron heating beginning 200 - 250 years after reverse shock passage ( or after 250 - 300 years in the evolution of the supernova remnant , i.e. between curves d and e ) will reproduce the current observed electron temperature of @xmath1 k. figure 1 illustrates this with spectra from the bepposax mecs @xcite and pds @xcite instruments acquired on 1997 november 26 , plotted against a pure thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum at @xmath161 k and a similar spectrum including an extra 4% of electrons in an accelerated distribution function .",
    "also shown are seven data points from a rocket flight on 1968 december 5 @xcite .",
    "these are shown in more detail in figure 6 plotted against pure thermal bremsstrahlung spectra corresponding to temperatures of @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath161 k. from figure 5 it is clear that on the basis of the hydrodynamic models used in these calculations , the ambient electron temperature should have increased between these two observations by @xmath167 k. depending on how one treats line emission and interstellar absorption ( both omitted from the theoretical spectra in figure 5 ) , such a temperature increase is marginally consistent with the observations .",
    "the ionization age @xmath168 in such a case would be @xmath169 @xmath110s@xmath70 , a factor of @xmath170 lower than observations @xcite .",
    "curves b and c in figure 5 , representing electron acceleration starting 150 or 200 years after explosion ( 100 or 150 years after reverse shock passage ) give values of @xmath168 more consistent with observations , but temperatures in the range 5 - 6 kev .",
    "the heating mechanism envisaged here only occurs at perpendicular shocks , and so not all the ejecta will be heated .",
    "consequently a thermal conduction energy loss from the heated regions might be expected , which would reduce the peak temperature and reduce the degree of temperature increase that might be expected between the observations of @xcite and the present day .",
    "one interesting feature of curves b and c is that the initial period of heating from @xmath171 k to @xmath172 k is very fast , but then slows abrubptly .",
    "the `` plateau '' at this temperature is due to the strong peak in the o radiative loss curve at this temperature , and the plasma temperature only starts to rise again once it has expanded sufficiently to reduce the density so that the collisionless heating can overcome the strong radiative losses .",
    "we will now investigate in more detail exactly where in the cas a ejecta a two stream instability that provides lower hybrid wave electron heating may occur . in the picture that we develop , the x - ray emitting shell of cas a is filled with shocks propagating in all directions as a result of forward or reverse shock interactions with density inhomogeneities . in the hot ion limit , where @xmath41 the wave growth rates fall dramatically with increasing mach number , so we can reasonably assume that only shocks with the minimum mach number to be supercritical are important . for plasma @xmath173",
    "( ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure ) of 1 this mach number is 1.7 for perpendicular shocks , falling to 1.35 for @xmath174 @xcite .",
    "a further simplifying assumption will be to assume that the accelerated electrons heat the ambient plasma to the observed temperature , @xmath161 k , and then that the instability continues in marginal stability .",
    "this is a lesser criterion on the electron energization process than the ambient electron heating discussed above . in such conditions ,",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath175 and @xmath176 in equation ( a7 ) are @xmath177 and @xmath178 respectively .",
    "the accelerated electron density is maximized for a given @xmath66 at @xmath179 from equation ( 11 ) .",
    "this is a lower value than is realizeable in practice , the minimum value being @xmath180 for high @xmath173 plasmas and short wavelength waves . at marginal stability ,",
    "the electron plasma @xmath181 is given by @xmath182 . in heavy element plasma with",
    "highly charged ions the electrons dominte the total plasma @xmath173 , so @xmath183 . for @xmath184 , @xmath185 ( from figure 7 ) , so @xmath186 .",
    "decreasing @xmath173 , allowing larger @xmath66 and hence larger ( i.e. more negative ) @xmath146 also requires larger @xmath187 , so @xmath188 holds over the range of reasonable values of @xmath173 , @xmath66 , and @xmath146 . assuming @xmath189 for the shock reflected ions , which is comparable to that observed in situ at solar wind shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the fraction of electrons accelerated is given by @xmath190 where @xmath191 cm s@xmath70 has been used in equation ( 11 ) .",
    "this corresponds to 70 atomic units found as the best match to bepposax data in @xcite .",
    "the density of accelerated electrons may be increased over that given by equation ( 11 ) if the energetic electrons are pitch angle scattered away from the magnetic field direction .",
    "this scattering mainly results from collisions with ions , while energy loss is due to collisions with ambient electrons . the isotropic density of accelerated electrons ,",
    "@xmath192 is given by @xmath193 .",
    "the electron - electron and electron - ion scattering cross sections have the same dependence on the energy of the accelerated electron , and so the isotropic accelerated electrons will have the same energy distribution as those directed along the magnetic field .",
    "this pitch angle scattering boosts the accelerated electron density by a factor @xmath194 for the same reflected ion density .",
    "hence an accelerated electron fraction of 4% may be possible in regions of the cas a ejecta where @xmath195 , i.e. @xmath196 k.    > from table 2 we see that ejecta reverse shocked up to @xmath197 years after the initial explosion may support sufficient electron acceleration to account for the observations . in this context",
    "it is important to realize , however , that ejecta shocked within 100 years of the explosion can have a low enough ion temperature to justify using equation ( 12 ) for the accelerated electron density , which would increase the accelerated electron fraction by around an order of magnitude over that given by equation ( 11 ) . in general cool plasma instabilities are stronger than those in hot plasma , and so our conclusion that electrons can be accelerated in ejecta shocked early in the evolution of cas a will be strengthened .",
    "hence our model for the electron acceleration to form the hard x - ray tail by non - thermal bremsstrahlung and to provide heating of the ambient ejecta plasma to @xmath1 k by coulomb collisions requires the existence of shocked ejecta that has cooled to give ion temperatures well below @xmath198 k. this requires that secondary shocks passing through this ejecta have velocities below @xmath199 km s@xmath70 so as to avoid reheating the ions up to temperatures where the instability weakens .",
    "this is actually quite likely , since a shock reflected for example from the blast wave moving through the shocked circumstellar medium will slow down considerably upon reaching the shell ejecta shell .",
    "we have previously argued @xcite that two stream instabilities formed ahead of fast shock fronts in supernova remnants might more realistically be modeled as kinetic rather than reactive instabilities .",
    "this is observationally motivated , in that the degree of electron heating predicted by models based on reactive instabilities ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is not observed @xcite .",
    "a theoretical justification comes from the fact that high mach number shocks are turbulent and not steady state structures , and reflected ions consequently will not form a `` beam '' , but will inhabit a much wider portion of phase space , giving rise to kinetic instabilities . with their lower growth rates , these will generally allow insufficient wave growth ahead of the shock before being overrun by the shock itself . in this paper",
    "we have avoided this problem by focusing on lower hybrid waves formed ahead of the shock that have group velocity away from the shock equal to the shock velocity itself , and hence stay in contact with the shock reflected ions for sufficiently long times to allow significant wave growth to occur .",
    "in this paper we have found that the most efficient electron acceleration occurs for the lowest mach number shocks , just above the first critical mach number , which is where shock is said to become `` supercritical '' .",
    "this denotes the onset of turbulence in the shock structure , and ion reflection which becomes progressively more unsteady and `` bursty '' in nature as the mach number increases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hence although we considered the lower hybrid instability excited by the secondary shocks in the cas a shell to be kinetic in nature since this appears to be a more robust assumption , the results of our calculations suggest that in this case reactive instabilities could be quite plausible also .",
    "it is also worth remarking that the designation `` reactive '' or `` kinetic '' comes from the mathematical treatment of two different limits of the vlasov equation ( see appendix a ) , and that physically , a continuum of instabilities exists between the kinetic and reactive limits .",
    "the further investigation of these would require numerical simulations .",
    "all instabilities in this paper have a minimum wavector @xmath200 arising from electromagnetic effects and a maximum @xmath201 from the requirement that the electron gyroradius be smaller than the wavelength . in marginal stability @xmath202 allowing us to estimate the magnetic field stength , @xmath203 , which evaluates to 1.9 mg for @xmath204 rad s@xmath70 in the @xmath205 year ejecta .",
    "> from table 1 the ejecta shocked at 50 years after explosion occupies a volume @xmath206 @xmath110 , in order to give the stated emission measure .",
    "the magnetic energy contained in this volume is @xmath207 ergs , not inconsistent with that deduced from the minimum energy synchrotron luminosity argument @xcite .",
    "these magnetic fields are assumed to be amplified from seed fields by the action of a rayleigh - taylor instability ( though see * ? ? ? * for another possibility ) .",
    "plausible evidence of this has recently been demonstrated in imaging spectroscopy of cas a by chandra @xcite . in the se quadrant of cas",
    "a in particular , emission in fe l and k shell lines is observed to be _ outside _ the emission from the lighter element si , suggesting that the si burning zone in the progenitor ( which produced the fe ) has overtaken the o burning zone which produced the si .",
    "this region in the se is also where recent xmm - newton observations find the hardest continuum @xcite , though these authors comment that the hard x - ray continuum emission actually is distributed quite uniformly over the remnant , which argues in favor of an emission mechanism independent of the magnetic field , i.e. bremsstrahlung , and not e.g. synchrotron emission .",
    "we have previously argued that the secondary shocks that excite the lower hybrid waves arise as the blast wave encounters density inhomogeneities in the circumstellar medium producing reflected shocks as in @xcite .",
    "however another possibility exists which is perhaps more intimately associated with fe emission and rayleigh - taylor instability , viz .",
    "the reverse shock encountering fe - co - ni bubbles in the ejecta @xcite .",
    "the simulation in the last reference demonstrates that such a scenario would produce large amounts of turbulence and vigorous mixing of fe with the overlying ejecta .",
    "we also note in passing that the idea of secondary shocks propagating through already shocked material , and also being highly magnetic , has been successfully applied to ultraviolet spectra of the bowshock in hh 47a by @xcite . in this case",
    "the strong magnetic field arises as radiatively cooling gas is compressed by hotter material around it .",
    "this is also possible but in our view unlikely for the regions of cas a we discuss .",
    "a common parameter quoted in models for electron heating is the fraction of the shock energy that is deposited in the electrons .",
    "it is not possible to make such a statement about the secondary shocks responsible for the electron acceleration in our model of cas a , but in terms of the blast wave energy an estimate can be made . if the @xmath208 ergs s@xmath70 required to accelerate the electrons comes from secondary shocks that originate from the blast wave , this energy is to be compared with the energy @xmath209 ergs s@xmath70 deposited by the blast wave in the shocked ions . neglecting energy going into cosmic ray ions , around 10% of the blast wave energy ends up in energized electrons to be compared with the @xmath210% estimated by ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the electron distribution function is given by balancing the imaginary terms in the dielectric response , which give wave growth due to shock reflected ions and landau damping by the accelerated electrons .",
    "we argue that secondary shocks maintain this electron distribution against the inevitable losses due to coloumb collisions , and that therefore these shocks must pass through a plasma element on timescales significantly shorter than those for coloumb collisions , which are of order 2 - 40 years for accelerated electrons of energy 10 - 70 kev in the ejecta shocked at early times",
    ". the accelerated electron distribution will be different from that modeled above if processes other than electron landau damping occur .",
    "@xcite argue that sufficient lower hybrid wave intensity is likely to exist such that electrons may be accelerated by a stochastic mechanism to mildly relativistic energies , but that this is more easily satisfied at high alfvn mach number shocks .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that in principle a distribution of electrons accelerated by lower hybrid waves comprising about 4% of the plasma electrons produced a very good match to existing spectra of cas a from bepposax .",
    "this model used cold plasma theory , assuming @xmath26 . in this paper",
    "we have extended the plasma theory to treat the opposite limit @xmath41 , and by performing calculations of the time dependent ionization balance within the ejecta of cas a , have identified regions where such wave generation may take place .    in ejecta",
    "shocked @xmath211 years or more since explosion , only the thermal plasma instability ( @xmath29 ) may occur .",
    "however this instability appears to be too weak to provide significant electron heating to give the hard x - ray emission . in ejecta",
    "shocked up to @xmath197 years since the explosion , either the cold or thermal plasma instabilities ( @xmath90 ) can occur , depending on the ion temperature .",
    "the cold plasma instability is more likely , and is sufficiently strong to explain the putative hard x - ray bremsstrahlung .",
    "such electron heating and acceleration mechanisms may plausibly occur elsewhere , the main requirement being a sufficently strong magnetic field .",
    "we have concentrated our efforts on cas a since it has the most conspicuous hard x - ray emission , is well studied in other respects , and is thought to have undergone relatively little elemental mixing @xcite which renders the plasma theory more tractable .",

    "<S> we consider in more detail a model previously proposed for the hard x - ray ( @xmath0 kev ) emission observed from the supernova remnant cas a , whereby electrons are accelerated by lower - hybrid waves and radiate bremsstrahlung . </S>",
    "<S> we consider both cold and thermal plasma limits of the modified two - stream instability that generates the lower - hybrid waves , and by studying time dependent ionization balance for various components of the cas a ejecta and shocked circumstellar medium , find locations within the shell where one or other of the instabilities may occur . either instability can be effective , with the cold plasma instability imposing fewer constraints on the shocked reflected ion population responsible for exciting the waves . </S>",
    "<S> the instability must be located in the ejecta shocked at the earliest times and therefore closest to the contact discontinuity where magnetic fields are expected to be the strongest . </S>",
    "<S> the energy deposited in this ejecta by collisions between accelerated and ambient electrons is broadly consistent with that required to reheat this ejecta to the observed temperature of @xmath1 k. </S>"
