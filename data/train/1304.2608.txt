    "the _ multiple zeta values _ and _ multiple zeta - star values _",

    "they are generalizations of the values of the riemann zeta function at positive integers and are known to be related to number theory , algebraic geometry , combinatorics , knot theory , and quantum field theory among others .",
    "research on these numbers has mainly been focused on their numerous linear and algebraic relations ; see for example @xcite and the references therein for an introduction .",

    "following an idea of zagier  @xcite , we look at the truncations in the ring @xmath6 , where @xmath5 runs over all primes ; the elements of @xmath7 are of the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , and two elements @xmath10 and @xmath11 are identified if and only if @xmath12 for all but finitely many primes @xmath5 .",

    "we define @xmath15 and call them _ finite multiple zeta(-star ) values _ in this paper .    the finite multiple zeta(-star ) values are similar to multiple zeta(-star ) values in many respects as we shall see in this paper .",
    "they do , however , have some differences , of which one of the most striking is the following :    [ prop : riemann ] we have @xmath16 for all positive integers @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath5 be an arbitrary prime larger than @xmath18 . taking a primitive root @xmath19 modulo @xmath5 , we have @xmath20",
    "since we have proved that @xmath21 for all but finitely many primes @xmath5 , it follows that @xmath16 in @xmath7 .",
    "bowman and bradley  @xcite proved that the multiple zeta values at the sequences obtained by inserting a fixed number of twos between @xmath22 add up to a rational multiple of a power of @xmath1 ; kondo , tanaka , and the first author  @xcite obtained the same result for multiple zeta - star values .",

    "our aim in this paper is to generalise zhao s results by giving the following bowman - bradley type theorem , which is a corollary of our main theorem :    [ thm : bb_modp ] if @xmath19 and @xmath37 are odd positive integers and @xmath33 is an even positive integer , then for all nonnegative integers @xmath24 and @xmath29 with @xmath38 , we have @xmath39    setting @xmath40 in theorem  [ thm : bb_modp ] gives zhao s results .      to state our main theorem",

    "for @xmath54 , write @xmath69 for the statement that @xmath65 for all @xmath64",
    ". then the main theorem says that @xmath69 is true for all @xmath54 .",
    "our proof consists of the following four lemmas :    [ lem : step0 ] the statement @xmath70 is true for all positive integers @xmath29 .",
    "[ lem : step1 ] suppose that @xmath24 is a positive integer such that @xmath71 is true .",

    "indeed , @xmath77 follows from lemmas [ lem : step2 ] and [ lem : step3 ] because @xmath78 vacuously satisfies the assumption ; lemma  [ lem : step1 ] then shows that @xmath79 is true for all nonnegative integers @xmath29 ; it follows that @xmath80 satisfies the assumption of lemmas [ lem : step2 ] and [ lem : step3 ] , and so @xmath81 is true ; induction proceeds in this manner .",
    "although lemma  [ lem : step0 ] is a direct consequence of ( * ? ?",
    "* theorem  4.4 ) , we give a rather detailed proof of the lemma for the convenience of the reader , partly because our notation differs from that of @xcite and partly because some of the concepts introduced will also be necessary afterwards .",
