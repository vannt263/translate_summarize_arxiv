    "probabilistic products are derived from an ensemble , tailored to specific user s need .",
    "for example , wind forecasts in the form of quantiles at selected probability levels are of particular interest for actors in the renewable energy sector @xcite .",

    "statistical techniques allow to adjust the ensemble forecast correcting for systematic inconsistencies @xcite .",
    "this step known as calibration is based on past data and usually focuses on a single or few aspects of the ensemble forecast .",
    "for example , calibration of wind forecast can be performed by univariate approaches @xcite or bivariate methods which account for correlation structures of the wind components @xcite .",
    "these calibration procedures provide reliable predictive probability distribution of wind speed or wind components for each forecast lead time and location independently .",
    "decision making problems can however require information about the spatial and/or temporal structure of the forecast uncertainty .",

    "the generation of scenarios from calibrated ensemble forecasts is a step that can be performed with the use of empirical copulas .",

    "ecc , which consists in the conservation of the ensemble member rank structure from the original ensemble to the calibrated one , has the advantage to be applicable to any location of the model domain without restriction related to the availability of observations .",

    "non - representative correlation structures in the raw ensemble are magnified after calibration leading to unrealistic forecast variability . as a consequence",

    "focusing on time series , a temporal component is introduced in the ecc scheme accounting for the autocorrelation of the forecast error over consecutive forecast lead times .",
    "the assumption of forecast error stationarity , already adopted for the development of fully parametric approaches @xcite , is exploited in combination with the structure information of the original scenarios .",

    "the correlation is decreasing as a function of the time lag , reaching near zero values for lags greater than 10 hours .",
    "however , for short and very short time lags , the correlation is high and stable over the rolling training datasets . in particular , focusing on a time lag of 1 hour , the correlation ranges between 60% and 80% . the correlation variability shown in figure [ fig : gamma ]",

    "the post - processed scenarios perform significantly better than the raw members in terms of @xmath122 ( figure [ fig : res_ss](a ) ) . in terms of @xmath125 ,",
    "the d - ecc scenarios are better than the ecc ones and significantly better than the raw ones when @xmath143 ( figure [ fig : res_ss](b ) ) . for higher orders of the variogram ( here @xmath144 , figure [ fig : res_ss](c ) ) , the forecast improvement after post - processing is still clear when using d - ecc while the ecc results are slightly worse than the ones of the original forecasts .",
    "figure [ fig : res_rh ] depicts the results in terms of multivariate rank histograms , @xmath131 ( upper panel ) and @xmath132 ( lower panel ) .",
    "the raw ensemble shows clear reliability deficiencies ( figures [ fig : res_rh](a ) and [ fig : res_rh](d ) ) which motivated the use of post - processing techniques .",
    "forecasts derived with ecc show still underdispersiveness but also too little correlation ( figures [ fig : res_rh](b ) and [ fig : res_rh](e ) ) while forecasts derived with d - ecc are better calibrated according to the rank histograms in figures [ fig : res_rh](c ) and [ fig : res_rh](f ) .",
    "indeed , both plots indicate good reliability of the d - ecc derived scenarios .",
    "figure [ fig : res_prod ] focuses on two products drawn from the time series forecasts : the daily mean wind speed ( upper panel ) and the daily maximal upward ramp ( lower panel ) .",
    "the performances are assessed in terms of @xmath11 , @xmath11 reliability and @xmath11 resolution , from left to right , respectively .",
    "looking at the results in terms of @xmath11 , we note the high similarity of figures [ fig : res_prod](a ) and [ fig : res_prod](d ) with figures [ fig : res_ss](a ) and [ fig : res_ss](c ) , respectively . as for the @xmath122 ,",
    "post - processing significantly improves the forecasts of the daily mean product . as for @xmath125 with @xmath144 , d - ecc improves the ramp product with respect to the original one while ecc does not generate improved products .",
    "the @xmath11 decomposition allows detailing the origin of these performances .",
    "we see in figures [ fig : res_prod](b ) and [ fig : res_prod](e ) that the @xmath11 results are mainly explained by the impact of the post - processing on the @xmath11 reliability components .",
    "however , focusing on the results in terms of @xmath11 resolution in figures [ fig : res_prod](c ) and [ fig : res_prod](f ) , we note that the resolution of the original and d - ecc products are comparable while ecc deteriorates the resolution of the ramp product with respect to the original one .",
    "those verification results are interpreted as follows .",
    "calibration corrects for the mean of the ensemble forecast and this is reflected , after the derivation of scenarios , by an improvement of the @xmath122 and daily mean product skill .",
    "calibration also corrects for spread deficiencies increasing the variability of the ensemble forecasts .",
    "this increase of spread associated with a preservation of the rank structure of the original ensemble , as it is the case in the ecc approach , enlarges indiscriminately the temporal variability of the forecasts and leads to a slight deterioration of the @xmath125 and ramp product results .",
    "the d - ecc approach provides scenarios with a temporal variability comparable to the one of the observation . in that case",
    ", the benefit of the calibration step in terms of reliability ( at single forecast lead times ) persists at the multivariate level ( looking at time trajectories ) after the reconstruction of scenarios with d - ecc .",
    "the multivariate reliability , or the reliability of derived products , is significantly improved after post - processing , though not perfect for specific derived products . moreover , d - ecc scenarios perform as well as the original ensemble forecast in terms of resolution .",
    "so , unlike ecc , d - ecc is able to generate reliable scenarios with a level of resolution that is not deteriorated with respect to the original ensemble forecasts .",
    "a new empirical copula approach is proposed for the post - processing of calibrated ensemble forecasts .",
    "the so - called dual ensemble copula coupling approach is introduced with a focus on temporal structures of wind forecasts .",
    "the new scheme includes a temporal component in the ecc approach accounting for the error autocorrelation of the ensemble members .",
    "the estimation of the correlation structure in the error based on past data allows adjusting the dependence structure in the original ensemble .",
    "based on cosmo - de - eps forecasts , the scenarios derived by d - ecc prove to be qualitatively realistic and quantitatively of superior quality .",
    "post - processing of wind speed combining emos and d - ecc improves the forecasts in many aspects . in comparison to ecc , d - ecc drastically improves the quality of the derived scenarios .",
    "applications that require temporal trajectories will fully benefit of the new approach in that case . as for any post - processing technique ,",
    "the benefit of the new copula approach can be weakened by improving the representation of the forecast uncertainty with more efficient member generation techniques and/or by improving the calibration procedure correcting for conditional biases .",
    "meanwhile , at low additional complexity and computational costs , d - ecc can be considered as a valuable alternative to the standard ecc for the generation of consistent scenarios .",
    "though only the temporal aspect has been investigated in this study , the dual ensemble copula approach could be generalized to any multivariate setting .",
    "further research is however required for the application of d - ecc at scales that are unresolved by the observations .",
    "for example , geostatistical tools could be applied for the description of the autocorrelation error structure at the model grid level .",
    "moreover , the mathematical interpretation of the d - ecc scheme developed here would benefit from further theoretical investigations based on idealized case studies .",
