    "understanding the universal critical behavior observed at and near continuous transitions is one of the major achievements of statistical physics ; the subject has been studied in depth for many years .",
    "it is generally considered however that the formalism based on the elegant renormalization group theory ( rgt ) can only be applied over a narrow temperature range , the `` critical region '' , while outside this region correction terms proliferate so attempts to extend the analysis become pointless .",
    "in fact this pessimistic conclusion follows largely because the traditional choices of scaling variables and scaling expressions are poorly adapted to the study of wide temperature ranges .",
    "the expressions for critical divergencies of observables @xmath3 near a critical temperature @xmath2 and in the thermodynamic ( infinite size ) limit are conventionally written @xmath4 with the scaling variable @xmath5 defined as @xmath6 and where @xmath7 represents an infinite set of confluent and analytic correction terms @xcite @xmath8 the exponents q , the confluent correction exponent @xmath9 , and many critical parameters such as amplitude ratios and finite size scaling functions , are universal , i.e. they are identical for all members of a universality class of systems . when the rgt formalism is outlined in textbooks or in authoritative reviews such as those of privman , hohenberg and aharony @xcite or pelissetto and vicari @xcite",
    "the scaling variable is defined as @xmath5 from the outset . however , because @xmath10 at infinite temperature , when @xmath5 is chosen as the scaling variable the correction terms in @xmath7 each individually diverge as temperature is increased .",
    "it indeed becomes extremely awkward to use the expressions in eq.([tcorrnf ] ) outside a narrow `` critical '' temperature region .",
    "a `` critical - to - classical crossover '' has been invoked ( e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) with the effective exponent @xmath11 tending to the mean field values as the high temperature gaussian fixed point is approached .",
    "the crossover appears as a consequence of the definition of the exponent in terms of the thermodynamic susceptibility and the scaling variable @xmath5 .",
    "there is no such crossover when the extended scaling analysis described below is used .",
    "although this is rarely stated explicitly , there is nothing sacred about the scaling variable @xmath5 ; alternative scaling variables @xmath12 can be legitimately chosen and indeed have been widely used in practice , see e.g. refs .",

    "temperature dependent prefactors can also be introduced in the scaling expressions on condition that the prefactor does not have a critical temperature dependence at @xmath2 .",
    "an `` extended scaling '' approach @xcite has been introduced which consists in a simple systematic rule for selecting scaling variables and prefactors , inspired by the well established high temperature series expansion ( htse ) method .",
    "this approach is a rationalization which leads automatically to well behaved high temperature limits as well as giving the correct critical limit behavior .",

    "one can immediately work with the microcanonical ( fixed energy ) ensemble and of course also compute the partition function and through it have access to the canonical ( fixed temperature ) ensemble as well .",
    "the main problem here is that computing the exact density of states for systems of even modest size is a very hard numerical task .",

    "the sampling methods give all the information needed .",

    "for the present analysis a density of states function technique based upon the same method as in @xcite was used though with considerable numerical improvements for all @xmath29 studied here ( adequate improvements to the @xmath181 data set would unfortunately have been too time - consuming ) .",

    "we use standard metropolis single spin - flip updates , sweeping through the lattice system in a type - writer order .",
    "measurements take place when the expected number of spin - flips is at least the number of sites . for high temperatures",
    "this usually means two sweeps between measurements and three or four sweeps for the lower temperatures we used .",

    "<S> it is often assumed that for treating numerical ( or experimental ) data on continuous transitions the formal analysis derived from the renormalization group theory can only be applied over a narrow temperature range , the `` critical region '' ; outside this region correction terms proliferate rendering attempts to apply the formalism hopeless . </S>",
    "<S> this pessimistic conclusion follows largely from a choice of scaling variables and scaling expressions which is traditional but very inefficient for data covering wide temperature ranges . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative `` extended scaling '' approach can be made where the choice of scaling variables and scaling expressions is rationalized in the light of well established high temperature series expansion developments . </S>",
    "<S> we present the extended scaling approach in detail , and outline the numerical technique used to study the three - dimensional @xmath0d ising model . after a discussion of the exact expressions for the historic @xmath1d ising spin chain model as an illustration , an exhaustive analysis of high quality numerical data on the canonical simple cubic lattice @xmath0d </S>",
    "<S> ising model is given . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that in both models , with appropriate scaling variables and scaling expressions ( in which leading correction terms are taken into account where necessary ) , critical behavior extends from @xmath2 up to infinite temperature . </S>"
