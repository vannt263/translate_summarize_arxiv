    "more than 30 years after the november revolution , charmonium spectroscopy continues to surprise and challenge .",
    "a new era began in april of 2003 when babar announced the discovery of the enigmatic @xmath0 .",
    "this state continues to perplex us and fermilab , cleo , bes , babar , and belle continue to add grist to the mill .",
    "this conference report is a brief review of the new heavy hadron spectroscopy .",
    "cdf recently announced the discovery of the @xmath1 meson .",
    "the timing was arranged with the fnal lattice group to permit them a prediction of its mass .",
    "the respective results are 6287(5)(1 ) mev@xcite and 6304(4 ) mev@xcite .",
    "thus cdf may claim a state , the lattice may claim a victory , and the @xmath1 appears to carry no surprises .",
    "historians may be interested to know , however , that godfrey and isgur@xcite predicted this mass with the same accuracy as the lattice , but with a twenty year lead time .",
    "the @xmath2 has been observed by cleo@xcite with a mass of 3524(1 ) mev .",
    "this may be compared with typical quark model expectations@xcite of 3518 mev , leading one to suspect that the @xmath2 is also not hiding anything from us .",
    "nevertheless , it tells us something : the @xmath2 lies within 2 mev of the spin - averaged mass of the @xmath3 multiplet : @xmath4 . since the splittings between these states are driven by the @xmath5 quark interactions , we are learning something about the dirac structure of confinement ( namely that it is an effective scalar ) .",
    "the cleo collaboration@xcite has observed the @xmath6 with a mass of 3638(4 ) mev and a width of 19(10 ) mev .",
    "this is to be compared with the old result of crystal ball@xcite of 3592(5 ) mev .",
    "the @xmath6 is of some interest because its splitting with the @xmath7 is driven by the hyperfine interaction and hence probes this interaction in a new region . specifically , the ground state vector - pseudoscalar splitting is @xmath8 mev whereas the excited splitting is now measured to be @xmath9 mev",
    ".    theoretical expectations for the former range from 108 to 123 mev in simple ( or ` relativised ' ) quark models@xcite and thus are within expectations .",
    "alternatively , the latter is predicted to be 67 mev in the quark model of eichten , lane , and quigg@xcite .",
    "however , the authors note that including unquenching effects due to open charm meson loops lowers this splitting to 46 mev which is taken as evidence in favour of their ` unquenched ' quark model",
    ". however , the simple quark models mentioned above@xcite find splittings of 42 - 53 mev , indicating that it is too early to make definitive conclusions about loop effects .",
    "it is worth noting , furthermore , that attempts to unquench the quark model are fraught with technical difficulty@xcite and a great deal of effort is required before we can be confident in the results of any model .",
    "these states are roughly 100 mev below quark model expectations and point to either exotic structure , such as @xmath11 molecules@xcite , or to a deep misunderstanding of heavy - light hadrons .",
    "for example , the @xmath11 and @xmath12 continua are both nearby and couple to @xmath13 and @xmath14 in s - wave .",
    "is it possible that we have underestimated the importance of coupled channel effects in some systems ?",
    "the @xmath15 was discovered by the selex collaboration at fnal@xcite in the final states @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the measured mass is 2632.6(1.6 ) mev and the state is surprisingly narrow with a width of less than 17 mev at the 90% confidence level .",
    "the ratio of the partial widths is measured to be    @xmath18    as pointed out by the selex collaboration , this is an unusual result since the @xmath11 mode is favoured by phase space .",
    "it is unlikely that this state is a @xmath19 hybrid since the mass of such a state is expected to be roughly 3170 mev .",
    "possible molecular states include a @xmath20 system at 2660 mev or @xmath21 or @xmath22 states at 2900 mev . however the former is a p - wave which is not favoured for binding , while the latter are too heavy to be plausible .",
    "the remaining possibility is that the @xmath15 is a radially excited @xmath19 vector@xcite ( although it is some 100 mev lighter than quark model predictions of 2730 mev ) .",
    "the peculiar decay ratio remains to be explained .",
    "experience with the decay modes of the @xmath23 to @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 points to a possible resolution : transition matrix elements for excited hadrons may have zeroes due to wavefunction nodes .",
    "it is possible that such a node is suppressing the @xmath11 decay mode .",
    "computation@xcite reveals that there is indeed a node but that it occurs at a wavefunction scale which is 20% lower than preferred .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath11 mode is always larger than the @xmath27 mode .",
    "we have run out of options and must conclude that the @xmath15 is an experimental artefact .",
    "this conclusion now appears likely because searches by focus@xcite , babar@xcite , and cleo@xcite have found no evidence for the state .",
    "the @xmath28 is the poster boy of the new heavy hadrons ",
    "it has been confirmed by four experiments@xcite at a mass of 3872 mev and is very narrow , @xmath29 mev at 95%",
    ". the anomalous nature of the @xmath30 has led to much speculation : tetraquark@xcite , cusp@xcite , hybrid@xcite , or glueball@xcite . but",
    "the most popular explanation is that it is a @xmath31 bound state@xcite .",
    "this model has successfully predicted@xcite the quantum numbers of the @xmath30 ( @xmath32@xcite ) , the decay mode @xmath33@xcite , that the @xmath34 and @xmath35 modes should be comparable@xcite , and that the @xmath34 invariant mass distribution should be dominated by the @xmath36@xcite while the @xmath35 invariant mass distribution should be dominated by the @xmath37@xcite .",
    "this string of successes has met with recent experimental challenges : ( i ) the @xmath30 has been observed decaying to @xmath38@xcite with a strength @xmath39@xcite .",
    "this rate is substantially larger than predicted in the model of ref .",
    "( ii ) there are rumours that belle have seen the mode @xmath40 and that its rate is ten times larger than that of @xmath41@xcite .",
    "the model predicts this ratio to be 1/20 .",
    "( iii ) babar report@xcite    @xmath42    this is at odds with the molecular picture which predicts a ratio of @xmath43 .",
    "( iv ) belle@xcite and babar@xcite have measured the product of branching ratios :    @xmath44 \\cdot 10^{-5}.\\ ] ]    the new @xmath45 data imply that @xmath46 which implies that @xmath47 .",
    "this is comparable to the rate @xmath48 and points to a large @xmath49 component in the @xmath30 .",
    "all of these new data may be accounted for if the predicted hidden charm interactions of ref.@xcite were over - estimated .",
    "this leads to weaker binding which gives rise to a much narrower @xmath30 with a dominant @xmath50 mode , weak @xmath41 and @xmath33 modes , and a radiative transition of the desired magnitude .",
    "the @xmath51 is seen by belle@xcite recoiling against @xmath52 in @xmath53 collisions .",
    "the state has a mass of 3943(11)(13 ) mev and a width of 87(22)(26 ) mev@xcite .",
    "the @xmath30 is seen to decay to @xmath31 and not to @xmath54 or @xmath55 .",
    "it is natural to attempt a @xmath56 @xmath49 assignment for this state since the expected mass of the @xmath57 multiplet is 3920 - 3980 mev and the expected widths are 30 - 165 mev@xcite . finally , if the @xmath31 mode is dominant it suggests that the @xmath51 is the @xmath58 .",
    "the problem with this assignment is that there is no evidence for the @xmath59 in the same data .",
    "this has led olsen to speculate@xcite that the @xmath30 is the @xmath60 .",
    "unfortunately this interpretation is also suspect because the @xmath60 has an expected mass of 4064 mev , 120 mev too high .",
    "the @xmath61 is claimed as a resonance in the @xmath54 subsystem of the decay @xmath62@xcite with a mass of 3940(11 ) mev and a width of 92(24 ) mev .",
    "the state has not been seen in the decay modes @xmath63 or @xmath31 .",
    "again , the mass and width of the @xmath64 suggest a radially excited p - wave charmonium . however , the @xmath54 decay mode is peculiar . in more detail ,",
    "belle measure @xmath65 .",
    "one expects that @xmath66 .",
    "this implies @xmath67 , which is unusual for a canonical @xmath68 state above open charm threshold .",
    "thus the @xmath64 is something of an enigma , driving the claim of the belle collaboration that it is a hybrid .",
    "this is perhaps premature  certainly more data are required before strong claims can be made .",
    "this state was observed by the belle collaboration@xcite in @xmath70 with a mass of 3931(4 ) mev and a width of 20(8)(3 ) and a claimed significance of 5.5 sigma .",
    "the @xmath55 helicity distribution is consistent with j=2 . in line with the @xmath30 and the @xmath64",
    ", the @xmath71 seems an obvious candidate for the @xmath72 ( the @xmath58 can not decay to @xmath55 ) .",
    "the predicted mass of the @xmath73 is 3972 mev and the predicted width is 80 mev@xcite .",
    "however , setting the mass to the measured 3931 mev restricts phase space sufficiently that the predicted strong width drops to 47 mev , reasonably close to the measurement .",
    "the predicted branching fraction to @xmath55 is 70% .",
    "the largest radiative transition is @xmath74 with a rate of 180(30 ) kev . at this stage",
    "we have no reason not to believe that the @xmath71 is the previously unknown @xmath72 .",
    "the @xmath75 was discovered as an enhancement in the @xmath41 subsystem of the reaction @xmath76 with a mass of 4259(8)(4 ) mev and a width of 88(23)(5 ) mev by the babar collaboration@xcite .",
    "evidentally the state is a vector with @xmath77 flavour .",
    "of course the low lying charmonium vectors are well known and the only mesonic charmonium vector available is the @xmath78 .",
    "however quark model estimates of its mass place it at 4460 mev , much too heavy for the @xmath64 .",
    "of course this statement relies on the quark model itself ",
    "llanes - estrada@xcite has argued that the @xmath64 is the @xmath79 based on the spectrum of a relativistic model .",
    "al._@xcite claim the @xmath64 is a tetraquark @xmath80 state which decays predominantly to @xmath81 . of the states which we know must exist ,",
    "the most natural explanation is as a @xmath49 hybrid@xcite .",
    "the lightest charmonium hybrid is expected at 4400 mev , somewhat high , but perhaps acceptable given our lack of experience in this sector .",
    "lastly , it is tempting to examine molecular interpretations of this state . in particular",
    "@xmath82 is an s - wave threshold at 4290 mev ",
    "close enough that the enhancement may simply be a cusp effect .",
    "if the system does bind , it does so with a novel mechanism since pion exchange does not lead to a diagonal interaction in this channel ( unlike the case of the @xmath28 ) .",
    "off - diagonal interactions may provide the required novelty .",
    "the new heavy meson spectroscopy is no mere butterfly collecting  the @xmath83 spectrum and the @xmath30s , @xmath64s , and @xmath71s challenge our understanding of qcd .",
    "can we rise to the challenge ?",
    "it is clear that the simple constituent quark model must fail somewhere ( gluonic degrees of freedom turn on , relativity and chirality become important , and coupled channels become dense )  are we seeing this ?",
    "lastly , have we entered a new era of ` mesonic nuclear physics ' ?",
