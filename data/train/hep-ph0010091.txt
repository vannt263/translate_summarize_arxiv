    "in this work we keep both heavy quark and heavy antiquark coupled sectors in the hqeft lagrangian . to our knowledge , until @xcite only the paper by wu @xcite in the literature actually dealt with both heavy quark and antiquark fields altogether in the effective lagrangian . in the present work , based on @xcite",
    ", we pursue this line of investigation further , looking for more symmetric expressions and a more transparent physical interpretation .    following the standard reference @xcite we introduce the effective fields for a heavy quark bound inside a hadron moving with ( four-)velocity @xmath0 , as @xmath1 @xmath2 where @xmath3 stands for the ( positive energy ) fermionic field describing the heavy quark in the full theory ; @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the @xmath6large  and @xmath6small  components of a classical spinor field respectively .",
    "similarly for a heavy antiquark , @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 stands for the ( negative energy ) anti - fermionic field in the full theory .    introducing the residual momentum @xmath10 for a heavy quark of total momentum @xmath11 as @xmath12 , the on - shell condition can be written as @xmath13 the underlying idea when introducing",
    "the residual momentum is that once removed the large mechanical momentum associated to the heavy - quark mass , only the low - energy modes remain in the effective theory @xcite .",
    "this is the standard way to handle heavy quarks in singly heavy hadrons according to hqet .",
    "however , one may conjecture about the possibility of performing such an energy - momentum shift by introducing a center - of - mass residual momentum for processes involving creation or annihilation of heavy quark - antiquark pairs at tree - level",
    ". hence only low energy modes of the fields ( about the heavy quark mass ) would be involved likely making meaningful our approach within the framework of an effective theory .    in sum ,",
    "the main difference of this paper w.r.t .",
    "other standard works is that we are concerned with the existence of terms in the transformed lagrangian mixing the large components of the heavy quark and heavy antiquark fields , i.e. @xmath14 , where @xmath15 stands for a combination of dirac gamma matrices and covariant derivatives , instead of directly writing currents as bilinears mixing both particle and antiparticle sectors as in @xcite .    //",
    "the tree - level qcd lagrangian is our point of departure : @xmath16 where @xmath17 @xmath18 + e^{imv{\\cdot}x}\\biggl[h_v^{(-)}+h_v^{(-)}\\biggr]\\ ] ] and @xmath19 standing for the covariant derivative @xmath20 with @xmath21 the generators of @xmath22 . substituting ( 7 ) in",
    "( 8) one easily arrives at @xmath23 where we have explicitly splitted the lagrangian into four different pieces corresponding to the particle - particle , antiparticle - antiparticle and both particle - antiparticle sectors .",
    "the former one has the form @xmath24 @xmath25 corresponding to the usual hqet lagrangian still containing both @xmath26 and @xmath27 fields .",
    "we employ the common notation where perpendicular indices are implied according to @xmath28    regarding the antiquark sector of the theory @xmath29",
    "@xmath30    the latter expressions , considered as quantum field lagrangians , do not afford tree - level heavy quark - antiquark pair creation or annihilation processes stemming from the terms mixing @xmath31 and @xmath32 fields since they contain either annihilation and creation operators of heavy quarks or annihilation and creation operators of heavy antiquarks separately .",
    "nevertheless there are two extra pieces in the lagrangian ( 8) : @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 \\nonumber\\ ] ] and @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38\\ ] ] where use was made of the orthogonality of the @xmath39 and @xmath40 fields . as could be expected ,",
    "there are indeed pieces mixing both quark and antiquark fields leading to the possibility of annihilation / creation processes deriving directly from the hqet lagrangian .",
    "after all the lagrangian ( 8) is still equivalent to full ( tree - level ) qcd .",
    "`` on the effective fields labels the particle / antiparticle sector of the theory @xcite .",
    "actually @xmath41 corresponds to negative ( positive ) frequencies associated with creation ( annihilation ) operators of quarks ( antiquarks ) .",
    "in fact some extra @xmath42 '' signs should be added on the conjugate fields , i.e. @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which however will be omitted to shorten the notation . ]",
    "let us note that , at first sight , one might think that the rapidly oscillating exponential would make both @xmath45 and @xmath46 pieces to vanish , once integrated over all velocities according to the most general lagrangian @xcite . however ,",
    "notice that actually this should not be the case for momenta of order @xmath47 of the gluonic field present in the covariant derivative .",
    "in fact , only such high - energy modes will survive , corresponding to the physical situation on which we are focusing , i.e. heavy quark - antiquark pair annihilation and creation .",
    "the heavy quark - gluon coupling for an annihilation process can be read off from the lagrangian piece : @xmath48\\ \\ ( d )   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    next we want to eliminate the unwanted degrees of freedom associated to the @xmath6small ",
    "components @xmath40 in @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the piece ( c ) is the leading one in the above development .    //",
    "assuming the same conditions as in figure 1 , we can write for almost free heavy quarks in the initial- or final - state : @xmath52 and for the conjugate fields @xmath53    let us note that we are using the free particle equations which can be viewed as derived from the non - interacting parts of the lagrangians @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively .",
    "in fact , neglecting the soft gluon interaction among heavy quarks amounts to describe them as plane waves , i.e. actually no bound states as a first approximation @xcite . therefore assuming a plane wave dependence of the field quantities , we can write in momentum space @xmath56\\ u_h(q)\\ ] ] @xmath57\\ ] ] where @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) denotes the full qcd spinor ( antispinor ) whereas @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) represents the hqet spinor ( antispinor ) , i.e. obeying @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) .    actually , in order to arrive to eqs .",
    "( 14 - 15 ) from eqs .",
    "( 10 - 13 ) one has to expand the denominators as power series of derivatives acting on the @xmath64-dependent factors , assumed exponentials , to be finally resummed as a geometric series of ratio @xmath65 according to the on - shell condition ( 5 ) . as a consequence , eqs .",
    "( 14 - 15 ) are only valid under the condition @xmath66 , which implies @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , the requirement @xmath68 satisfies the above condition and will allow a later non - relativistic expansion .    substituting the above equations into the @xmath69 lagrangian ( 9 ) , we readily get for the on - shell heavy quark ( vector ) current coupling to a gluon , suppressing color indices and matrices    @xmath70\\ u_h\\ ] ] which can also be written as @xmath71\\ u_h\\ ] ] since @xcite @xmath72 with the projectors @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "0.5 cm    we shall make use of the anticommutation relation :    @xmath75    now , in the center - of - mass frame we can write @xmath76 , leading to the expression for the heavy quark vector current @xmath77\\ u_h\\ ] ] where @xmath78 .",
    "the following identity is satisfied ( in the dirac representation ) :    @xmath79    therefore identifying as two component spinors @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , we obtain from ( 17 ) the analogous expression to eq .",
    "( a.9b ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ,    @xmath82\\ { \\xi}\\ ] ]    i.e. the vertex obtained from full qcd in terms of the pauli spinors @xmath83 and @xmath84 , allowing a systematic non - relativistic expansion : the leading term @xmath85 associated with ( c ) in ( 9 ) as expected .",
    "we have derived a complete tree - level heavy - quark transformed lagrangian in terms of the effective fields @xmath39 , keeping the particle - antiparticle mixed pieces allowing for heavy quark - antiquark pair annihilation / creation .",
    "let us note that such pieces are not generally shown in similar developments in the literature .",
    "indeed , it may seem quite striking that a low - energy effective theory could be appropriate to deal with hard processes such as @xmath86 annihilation or creation .",
    "the keypoint is that assuming a kinematic regime where heavy quarks / antiquarks are almost on - shell and moving with small relative velocity , the strong momentum dependence associated with the heavy quark masses can be factored out , so that a description based on the low frequency modes of the fields still makes sense .",
    "such a kinematic regime is well matched by heavy quarkonium states and by colored intermediate states in the so - called color - octet model recently introduced @xcite to account for high production rates of heavy quarkonia at the fermilab tevatron @xcite .",
    "in particular , we have focused on an annihilation process with initial - state quarks satisfying the dirac equation of motion for free fermions .",
    "thus , we have derived directly from the @xmath45 piece the heavy quark vector current coupling to a background gluonic field , recovering a well known expression shown in the literature @xcite .",
    "a similar development can be done for a heavy quark pair creation process from the @xmath46 piece .",
    "the main point stressed in this paper is that one can derive the heavy quark / antiquark vector current coupling to a hard gluonic field from the corresponding piece of the transformed tree - level lagrangian ( 8) , without resorting to an _ ad hoc _ construction from the fermionic spinors themselves , perhaps providing a more self - consistent basis to the matching procedure of the effective theory onto full qcd @xcite .",
