    "white dwarfs are the evolutionary end - products of most stars",
    ". therefore , a large number of white dwarfs should be present in the galaxy . determining the contribution of white dwarfs to the total mass of the galaxy could help to solve one of the fundamental questions in modern astronomy : what is the nature of dark matter ?",
    "the fact that the rotation curves of many galaxies are not keplerian ( rubin , thonnard , & ford 1978 ) invokes the existence of additional dark matter distributed heavy - halo .",
    "it is estimated that for the milky way only @xmath6 of the total mass are present in the form of stars , gas and dust in the galactic disk and halo ( alcock 2000 ) .",
    "the role of white dwarfs in the dark matter problem is still uncertain .",
    "an open issue is the fraction of white dwarfs in the thick - disk and halo populations , as well as their fraction of the total mass of the galaxy . in this context ,",
    "kinematic studies have proved a useful tool in deciding on population membership of white dwarfs .",
    "the common problem of kinematic studies of white dwarfs is the lack of radial velocity measurements . especially deviating conclusions derived from the white dwarfs of the oppenheimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) sample demonstrate that different assumptions on the values of the radial velocity @xmath7 can produce different fractions of halo and thick disk stars and thus have a strong impact on the determination of the white dwarf halo density ( reid , sahu & hawley 2001 ) .",
    "therefore a sample of white dwarfs with known radial velocity measurements is needed in order to obtain the full 3d kinematic information .",
    "pauli et al .",
    "( 2006 ) presented a complete 3d kinematical study of @xmath0 da white dwarfs . here",
    "we present a progress report on the analysis of the entire spy sample of more than one thousand white dwarfs and hot subdwarfs .",
    "we present the results of a kinematic analysis of another @xmath8 da white dwarfs .",
    "the eso supernova ia progenitor survey ( spy , see napiwotzki et al .",
    "2003 ) provided us with high resolution spectra of about 1000 degenerate stars .",
    "the sharp absorption core of the hydrogen lines allowed accurate radial velocities to be measured .",
    "typical errors are not greater than @xmath9km / s .",
    "we added radial velocity variable stars , for which the radial velocity curves had been solved and the systemic velocity had been derived ( napiwotzki et al.2002 , karl et al .",
    "2004 and morales - rueda et al .",
    "we also included resolved wide binaries with no measured radial velocity variability in two or more spectra ( @xmath10km / s ) . a spectroscopic analysis , done by voss and koester ( private communications ) , yielded atmospheric parameters , which were used to derive masses and gravitational redshifts .",
    "proper motions were extracted from catalogues through the vizier service ( e.g.  usno  b , ucac2 , etc . ) .",

    "for the computation of orbits and kinematic parameters we used the code by odenkirchen & brosche ( 1992 ) based on the galactic potential of allen & santilln ( 1991 ) .    unlike for main - sequence stars the population membership of white dwarfs",
    "can not be determined from spectroscopically measured metalicities .",
    "therefore we have to rely on kinematic criteria , which have to be calibrated using a suitable calibration sample of main - sequence stars . in our case",

    "( 1993 ) and fuhrmann ( 2004 and references cited therein ) .    halo and thick disk stars can be separated by means of their [ fe / h ] abundances , they possess a higher [ mg / fe ] ratio than thin disk stars ( see pauli et al .",

    "the galactic orbits of thin disk , thick disk stars and halo stars differ in a characteristic way allowing another classification criterion to be defined ( see figure  3 ) .",

    "thick disk stars can climb up to @xmath35kpc ( figure 3 , middle panel ) and finally halo stars reach even higher altitudes above the plane or have a highly chaotic orbit ( figure 3 , right hand panel ) .",
    "halo candidates are all white dwarfs that are either situated outside the @xmath36-limit of the thick disk in the @xmath2-velocity diagram or that lie in region c in the @xmath37-@xmath3 diagram and have halo type orbits . for the da white dwarfs the @xmath2-velocity diagram and the @xmath37-@xmath3",

    "ages are another criterion for population membership .",
    "halo and thick disk white dwarfs should be old stars . since the cooling ages of the of most white dwarfs in the spy sample are small ( @xmath41yr ) they have evolved from long - lived , i.e.  low mass stars and hence must themselves be of low mass .",
    "we used the cooling tracks form wood ( 1995 ) and driebe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( see figure 4 , left hand side ) to determine the masses and the cooling times of our white dwarfs and the initial - to - final - mass relation of weidemann ( 2000 ) to get the mass of our progenitor stars .",
    "all but one halo star and @xmath42 of the @xmath43 thick disk white dwarfs have sufficiently low masses and are therefore old .",
    "however , our age estimates could be misleading if the stars had evolved through close binary interaction phases or may even result from a merger event . on the other hand",
    "the kinematics of a thick disk or halo white dwarf could be mimiced by a thin disk star ejected from the galactic plane ( runaway star ) .",
    "the halo star wd0239 + 109 is most likely such a runaway star from the thin disk , as it is only 2.2 gyr old and is not massive enough ( @xmath44 ) to be of a merger origin .",
    "only one of the thick disk stars has a high enough mass to be a merger ( @xmath45 ) , two live within a binary system .",
    "hence we issue a birth certificate of the thick disk population only to these @xmath42 white dwarfs .",
    "the others could be runaway stars from the thin disk or merger , as their kinematic classification is quite assured .",
    "this leaves us with a fraction of @xmath46 halo and @xmath47 thick disk white dwarfs .",
    "figure 4 ( right hand side ) shows our final result within the statistical 3@xmath17-border .",
    "the classification scheme developed in pauli et al .",
    "( 2003 ) has been used to kinematically analyse a sample of more than @xmath48 da white dwarfs from the spy project . combining the three kinematic criteria , position in the @xmath2-diagram , position in the @xmath38 diagram and galactic orbit , with age estimates we have found twelve halo and @xmath5 thick disk members .    when we do the statistics for our local , white dwarf , population memberships we find a 3@xmath17-area as shown in figure 4 ( right hand side ) . there s still room for @xmath49 to @xmath50 of the local , hot white dwarfs to to belong to the thick disk .",
    "and between @xmath51 and @xmath52 can belong to the halo population and contributes a big amount to the baryonic dark matter of the milky way .",
