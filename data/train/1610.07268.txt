    "modified gravity ( mg ) models presume that the true law of gravity deviates from the general relativity ( gr ) on the cosmological scale and claim that the apparent acceleration of the universe in the present epoch can be explained as a function of mg without resorting to anti - gravitational dark energy ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) . despite that not even an weak evidence for a failure of gr on the cosmological scale",

    "a variety of diagnostics have been developed not only to detect , if any , the presence of mg ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) but also to break the degeneracy between the mg and the other alternative scenarios such as the interacting dark energy models @xcite .",
    "the dynamic masses of galaxy groups galaxies while a galaxy group is less massive object having less than @xmath2 galaxies @xcite .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , however , there is no clear boundary that separates the galaxy groups from the galaxy clusters .",
    "following @xcite , we call both the galaxy clusters and groups the `` massive groups '' throughout this paper . ] is one of those recently developed diagnostics , which have been in the limelight of extensive studies @xcite because of its power to probe the nature of gravity in the local universe .",
    "mg models are classified by the factors additionally introduced to modify gr such as an extra degree of freedom , higher dimensional spacetime , non - locality , higher derivatives , most of which lead to an effective enhancement of gravity ( so called , the fifth force ) on the cosmological scale .",
    "the survival of such mg models against the stringent solar system test ( e.g. , see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) is deliberately implemented by its screening process through which gr can be restored on the small scale @xcite . in the presence of unscreened mg , the dynamic mass of a galaxy group would appear to be higher than its lensing mass since the latter depends only on the curvature of space around the group .",
    "thus , any discrepancy between the dynamic and the lensing masses of the galaxy groups should indicate the presence of mg and thus can be used to constrain the strength of its consequential fifth force @xcite .",
    "the dynamic mass of a group was conventionally estimated by measuring the velocity dispersions of the luminous central galaxies .",
    "this conventional estimate , however , would fail to discriminate the dynamic mass from the lensing mass even in the presence of mg since gr should be almost completely restored at the locations of the luminous central galaxies .",
    "the infall velocities of the satellite galaxies located outside the virial radii of the galaxy groups have been suggested as better indicators of the presence of unscreened mg .",
    "however , it has been concerned that the dependence of the infall velocities of the satellites on the baryonic processes as well as the large uncertainties associated with their measurements would contaminate a signal , even if detected , of the difference between the dynamic and the lensing masses @xcite .",
    "looking to other dynamical properties of the galaxy groups than their dynamic masses may be necessary to complement the existing local probes of gravity on the galaxy group scale . here",
    ", we suggest the odds of the bound violations of the turn - around radii of the galaxy groups as a new complementary diagnostics . in the standard @xmath0cdm cosmology based on gr ,",
    "the averaged turn - around radius of the galaxy groups are bounded by a finite upper limit that depends on the amount of @xmath0 as well as on the masses of the groups @xcite .",
    "a recent numerical study has revealed that in rare occasions the turn - around radii of individual galaxy groups commit the bound violations even in the @xmath0cdm cosmology @xcite .",
    "given that the turn - around radii of the galaxy groups reflect how far the expanding spacetime resists the gravitational attraction of the groups , we speculate that the presence of mg would produce a substantial difference in the odds of the bound violation of the galaxy groups . the main task that we are to perform in the current work is to numerically investigate how strong effect the presence of mg has on the odds of the bound - violation of the turn - around radii of the galaxy groups and to assess the practical applicability of this new local diagnostics as a complementary test of gravity .",
    "this paper is divided into three sections the contents of which are summarized as follows . in section [ sec : review ] we provides a brief review of a certain type of two mg models considered to perform our task and describes the sample of the galaxy groups from n - body simulations for the standard @xmath0cdm cosmology and for two mg models . in section [ sec : vr ] we presents a detailed description of the procedures with which the odds of the bound violation of the tun - around radii of the galaxy groups are calculated for each model . in section [ sec : sum ] we summarize the results and discuss the feasibility of using it as an complementary probe of gravity .",
    "as a fiducial model of mg whose effect on the odds of the bound violation of the turn - around radius is to be explored , we focus on the normal branch dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( ndgp ) brane world model @xcite which possesses the following two salient features : first , in this model the hubble parameter @xmath3 can be made identidal to that of the standard @xmath0cdm model by @xcite .",
    "second , the vainshtein mechanism@xcite on which the screening process of this model relies on is independent of the shape of the potential function of the scalar field @xcite .",
    "the initial conditions of the ndgp model can be specified by determining the values of seven key parameters : the spectral index ( @xmath4 ) , the baryon density parameter ( @xmath5 ) , the matter density parameter ( @xmath6 ) , the @xmath0 energy density parameter ( @xmath7 ) , the hubble constant ( @xmath8 ) , linear density amplitude ( @xmath9 ) , cross - over scale ( @xmath10 ) ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the first six represents the same key cosmological parameters as the standard @xmath0cdm model requires , while the last one @xmath10 is an extra parameter introduced by the ndgp model .",
    "the cross over scale @xmath10 appears in the following modification of the linearized poisson equation as an additional term to quantify the effect of enhanced gravity @xcite : @xmath11\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath12 in the newtonian potential , @xmath13 is the hubble parameter and @xmath14 is the mean mass density of the universe , and @xmath15 is the dimensionless density contrast .",
    "the strength of the fifth force decreases with the increment of the value of the cross over scale @xmath10 in the ndgp models .",
    "the gr would be restored in the high - density region via the vainshtein mechanism as the value of @xmath10 increases with the growth of non - linearity @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive review on the vainshtein mechanism and the ndgp models is presented in @xcite .",
    "three cosmological models are considered for our numerical exploration .",
    "the standard gr+@xmath0cdm cosmology and two ndgp models denoted as df5 and df6 . from here on , the two abbreviated terms , the gr and the gr+@xmath0cdm cosmology , are used interchangeably .",
    "the values of the key cosmological parameters adopted for the three models are listed in table [ tab:3models ] .",
    "as can be read , except for the values of @xmath10 and @xmath9 , the key cosmological parameters are set at the same values of the planck cosmology without massive neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the highest value of @xmath9 of the df5 model translates into the strongest fifth force that still meets the observational constraint from the cluster counts @xcite .",
    "the n - body simulations implemented by the adapted ecosmog - v code @xcite were run from @xmath16 to @xmath17 on the periodic box of volume @xmath18 with a total of @xmath19 dm particles of individual mass @xmath20 , producing five different realizations for each model .",
    "the rockstar halo finder developed by @xcite has been applied to the phase space distributions of dm particles at each @xmath21-snapshot for the identification of the bound dm halos . in the catalogs of the rockstar halos",
    "are stored such information on the dm halos as the comoving positions and velocities of their centers of masses , virial radii and masses , and so on from each realization for each model .",
    "the viral radius of each dm halo @xmath22 has been computed as the spherical radius from its center of mass at which the relation of @xmath23 is satisfied where @xmath24 represents the critical mass density of the universe . accordingly , the virial mass @xmath25 of each halo has been computed as the mass enclosed by the spherical radius @xmath22 .",
    "consider a massive group for which prior information on the virial mass and radius ( @xmath26 and @xmath22 , respectively ) is available .",
    "its gravity will influence the peculiar motions not only of its satellites located in the infall zone but also of the neighbor galaxies located in the bound zone that corresponds to the distance range @xmath27 .",
    "it has been found that for the case of the @xmath0cdm cosmology , the interplay between the gravity and the expanding space molds the bound - zone velocity profile around a massive group to have the following power - law shape @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the amplitude and the slope parameters of the profile , respectively , and @xmath31 .",
    "after @xcite reported that equation ( [ eqn : vr ] ) with @xmath32 and @xmath33 fitted well the _",
    "average _ profile @xmath34 numerically obtained from the bound - zone dm particles around the group - size halos with @xmath35 at @xmath17 , it has been proven that equation ( [ eqn : vr ] ) with the same best - fit parameters still describes well the average bound - zone velocity profiles even when the latter was obtained not from the dm particles but from the bound dm halos @xcite .    in the dgp model , the presence of mg is more eminent in the bound zone than in the infall zone since the former has lower densities . in other words , in the dgp model the bound - zone objects around a massive group react more sensitively to a fifth force produced by the unscreened mg than the infall - zone satellites .",
    "we speculate that the fifth force would decrease the slope of the average bound - zone velocity profile since the effective gravity of the massive group enhanced by the fifth force is capable of resisting the expanding space at farther distances . before",
    "quantitatively investigating if the decrement of the slope of the bound - zone velocity profile will be substantial , however , it is first necessary to confirm that the bound - zone peculiar velocity profiles for the ndgp models can be also described by the same formula , equation ( [ eqn : vr ] ) , whose validity was tested only for the case of the @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "putting a mass threshold cut @xmath36 on the rockstar halo catalog described in section [ sec : review ] , we make a sample of the central groups with virial masses @xmath37 .",
    "for each central group in the sample , we look for the neighbor rockstar halos which satisfy two conditions .",
    "first , they should belong to the bound zone around the central group with their separation distances @xmath38 lie in the range of @xmath39 .",
    "second , the numbers of the particles , @xmath40 , that comprise a halo are equal to or larger than @xmath41 .",
    "the bound - zone halos composed of less than @xmath41 dark matter particles are excluded to avoid possible contamination caused by incomplete condensation .",
    "let @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the comoving velocities of a central group and a bound - zone halo , respectively , and let @xmath44 be the separation vector from the central group to the bound - zone halo .",
    "we first subtract @xmath42 from @xmath43 to obtain the relative peculiar velocity of the bound - zone halo in the rest frame of the central group .",
    "then , we perform the dot product between @xmath45 and @xmath46 to project the relative peculiar velocity of the bound - zone halo onto the radial direction , @xmath47 . let @xmath48 denote the magnitude of the projected relative peculiar velocity , @xmath49 , and call it the bound - zone velocity at the separation distance @xmath50 .    dividing @xmath48 and @xmath38 of each bound - zone halo by the circular velocity of its central group @xmath51 and the virial radius @xmath22 , respectively , we express the rescaled bound - zone velocity profile @xmath52 as a function of the rescaled separation distance @xmath53 .",
    "note that both of @xmath54 and @xmath55 are dimensionless .",
    "we also divide the range of @xmath55 into several intervals , @xmath56 $ ] , each of which has the same length @xmath57 and record the numbers of the bound - zone halos , @xmath58 , whose values of the rescaled distances @xmath55 belong to each interval .",
    "the mean bound - zone velocity at each @xmath55-interval is computed by taking the average over those @xmath58 halos .",
    "let @xmath59 and @xmath60 denote the numbers of the bound - zone halos around each central group and the number of the central groups in the @xmath61th realization of each model .",
    "let also @xmath62 denote the number of the central groups in the sample and the value of the bound - zone velocity of the @xmath63th halo whose separation distance lies in the range of @xmath56 $ ] around the @xmath64th central group in the @xmath61th realization of each model , respectively .",
    "the bound - zone velocity profile in the @xmath61th realization , @xmath65 , can be computed by taking the average first over the @xmath66 bound - zone halos and then over the @xmath67 central groups as @xmath68 finally , the bound - zone velocity profile @xmath69 for each model can be obtained by taking the average over the five realizations .",
    "the errors can be also computed by using the bootstrap technique .",
    "let @xmath70 denote the original sample of the bound - zone velocity profiles from the five realizations . from this sample ,",
    "we draw five bound - zone velocity profiles with repetition allowed to create a boostrap resample .",
    "we create @xmath2 boostrap resamples and calculate the errors associated with the measurement of the average bound - zone velocity profile as the one standard deviation scatter around the mean value averaged over the @xmath2 bootstrap resamples : @xmath71^{2}\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath65 represents the average bound - zone velocity profile from the original sample of the @xmath61th realization and @xmath72 is from the @xmath73th bootstrap resample of the @xmath61th realization .",
    "figure [ fig : vr ] plots the bound - zone peculiar velocity profile averaged over five realizations as filled circles for three models with the boostrap errors .",
    "there is a substantial difference in @xmath54 between the gr and the df5 models .",
    "the latter has a lower slope than the former , as speculated .",
    "furthermore , the magnitude of @xmath54 in the df5 model is larger in the whole bound - zone range than in the gr model .",
    "fitting the numerically obtained profile @xmath69 of each model to equation ( [ eqn : vr ] ) by employing the maximum likelihood method , we search for the values of @xmath30 and @xmath29 which minimize the following @xmath74 . @xmath75^{2 } } { \\sigma^{2}(\\tilde{r}_{i})}\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath76 denotes the @xmath63th interval of @xmath55 and @xmath77 represents the theoretical prediction of equation ( [ eqn : vr ] ) . to determine the uncertainties associated with the determination of @xmath30 and @xmath29 , we first determine the joint probability @xmath78 $ ] . using the probability density functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 calculated as @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively",
    ", we also determine the marginalized errors , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",

    "the third and fourth columns of table [ tab:3models ] display the best - fit values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 with the associated errors @xmath84 and @xmath89 for each model .",
    "the solid lines in figure [ fig : vr ] correspond to the analytic model whose characteristic parameters are set at the best - fit values listed in table [ tab:3models ] .",
    "as can be read , the power - law slope @xmath30 has the largest ( smallest ) value for the gr ( df5 ) case and the difference in the value of @xmath30 between the two models is statistically significant .",
    "our interpretation of the results shown in figure [ fig : vr ] is as follows : due to the non - vanishing fifth force , the bound - zone velocity profile in the df5 model decreases less rapidly with the distance than in the gr model . for the case of the df6 model ,",
    "the fifth force is not strong enough to produce any statistically significant difference in @xmath69 from the gr case , as expected .",
    "the gr+@xmath0cdm cosmology puts an upper bound , @xmath90 , on the average turn - around radius of a galaxy group with mass @xmath26 @xcite : @xmath91 this upper bound , however , limits the _ expectation value _ of the turn - around radius but not the individual values of @xmath92 because the event of a turning around is a generically random process @xcite .",
    "in other words , the turn - around radii of individual galaxy groups can have values larger than @xmath90 although the occurrence of such bound violations is quite rare @xcite .    strictly speaking",
    ", the turn - around radius @xmath92 of a galaxy group is an attribute that it acquires at the end of its proto - group stage .",
    "the optimal way to estimate the turn - around radius of a central group in a n - body experiment is to track the trajectories of the component dm particles back to the proto - group regime and then to find the location at which the mean peculiar velocitiy equals the hubble speed .",
    "this optimal routine , however , is simply impractical and thus not applicable to real data .",
    "recently , @xcite formulated a less optimal but much more practical routine that makes it possible to estimate the turn - around radius of a galaxy group from the direct observables . this routine counts on equation ( [ eqn : vr ] ) to find @xmath92 at which the following equation holds true : @xmath93^{-n}\\ , .\\ ] ] in section [ sec : vr ] we determine the best - fit values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the mean bound - zone velocity profile averaged over the central groups . to use equation ( [ eqn : rt ] ) to estimate @xmath92 of each central group , however , it is necessary to determine the values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 by separately fitting the individual bound - zone velocity profile around each central group to equation ( [ eqn : vr ] ) .",
    "let @xmath94 be the bound zone velocity profile of the @xmath64th central group in the @xmath61th realization of each model .",
    "replacing @xmath95 in equation ( [ eqn : chi2 ] ) by @xmath94 and minimizing @xmath74 , we determine the best - fit values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 and put them into equation ( [ eqn : rt ] ) to estimate the turn - around radius of the @xmath64th central group in the @xmath61th realization , say @xmath96 .    dividing the range of the logarithmic masses of the central groups , @xmath97 , into several intervals",
    "each of which has the same length @xmath98 , we calculate the mean turn - around radius , @xmath99 , by taking the average of @xmath96 over the central groups whose logarithmic masses lie in a given interval of @xmath100 $ ] .",
    "the mean turn - around radius , @xmath92 , of a central group at each @xmath25-interval is now evaluated as taking the average of @xmath101 over the five realizations for each model .",
    "figure [ fig : rt_all ] plots @xmath92 versus @xmath25 for the gr , df6 and df5 models as red , blue and green solid lines , respectively . as can be seen",
    ", there is a notable difference in @xmath102 between the gr and the df5 models . to see whether or not this difference is statistically significant , we calculate",
    "the bootstrap errors @xmath103 in the estimation of @xmath92 by generating @xmath2 bootstrap resamples as done in section [ sec : vr ] .",
    "figure [ fig : rt_gr ] shows @xmath102 as filled circles with the bootstrap errors for the gr case .",
    "the red solid line represents the upper bound limit @xmath104 given in equation ( [ eqn : rt_u ] ) . as can be seen , the mean turn - around radius is lower than the upper limit in the whole range of @xmath25 .",
    "the blue solid line is obtained by putting the global average values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 listed in table [ tab:3models ] into equation ( [ eqn : rt ] ) and solving it for @xmath92 .",
    "note that the blue solid line is in good agreement with the filled circles in the entire range of @xmath25 , which is consistent with the claim of @xcite that the average turn - around radii can be computed by using the average bound - zone velocity profile with the two parameters set at the universal best - fit values .",
    "figure [ fig : rt_df5 ] plot the same as figure [ fig : rt_gr ] but for the case of df5 model . as can be seen ,",
    "similar to the gr case , the df5 model yields the average turn - around radii lower than the upper limit @xmath90 in the entire range of @xmath25 .",
    "note , however , that the gap between the average turn - around radii and the upper bound limit is narrower in the df5 model than in the gr case .",
    "now , we are ready to calculate the odds of the bound violations , for which we exclude those central groups whose logarithmic masses exceed @xmath105 . given that the df5 model produces more massive groups in the highest mass section than the other two models , it might cause a bias in the calculation of the odds of the bound - violations if those central groups with @xmath106 were not excluded .",
    "let @xmath107 denote the turn - around radii of the central objects with mass @xmath25 in the @xmath61th realization of each model .",
    "define @xmath108 as the the ratio of @xmath101 to the upper bound @xmath104 as @xmath109 . dividing the whole range of @xmath108 into several small bins",
    "each of which has the same length @xmath110 and counting the numbers of the central groups whose ratios belong to each bin , @xmath111 $ ] , we first compute the probability density function , @xmath112 , and then integrate @xmath112 over @xmath108 , to derive the cumulative probability distribution , @xmath113 from the @xmath61th realization of each model .",
    "finally , we take the average of the cumulative probability functions over the five realizations for each model as @xmath114 figure [ fig : cpro ] plots @xmath115 versus @xmath108 with the bootstrap errors for the three models . as can be seen , the df5 ( gr ) model yields the highest ( lowest ) values of @xmath115 in the range of @xmath116 .",
    "in other words , in the df5 model the bound violation occurs relatively more frequently than in the gr model .",
    "meanwhile , no significant difference is found between the gr and the df6 models , as expected .",
    "the value of @xmath117 at @xmath118 represents the number fraction of the central groups whose turn - around radii are equal to or larger than the upper bound , i.e. , the odds of the bound violations of the turn - around radii of the central groups .",
    "the sixth column of table [ tab:3models ] lists the odds of the bound violations , @xmath119 , for the three models . in the gr model the odds of the bound violations is @xmath120 while in the df5 model it is @xmath121 . as speculated , in the df5 model due to the fifth force",
    "the bound violations occur relatively more frequently .",
    "the signal to noise ratio for the difference in the odds of the bound - violations between the two models is found to be as high as @xmath122 .",
    "this result indicates that the odds of the bound - violations of the turn - around radii of the central groups can be a powerful indicator of the presence of mg .    to examine",
    "if the odds of the bound violations depend on the mass threshold of the central groups , we increase the value of @xmath123 and rederived @xmath117 by repeating the whole process described in the above .",
    "figure [ fig : cpro3 ] and [ fig : cpro5 ] plot the same as figure [ fig : cpro ] but for the case that @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively .",
    "as can be seen , no substantial change is made by increasing the values of @xmath123 . due to the lower numbers of the central groups for these two cases ,",
    "however , the cumulative probabilities have larger errors and the odds of the bound violations have lower signal - to - noise ratios of @xmath126 .",
    "the turn - around radius of a massive group can be determined as the distance at which the average velocity of its bound - zone galaxies becomes equal to the hubble speed @xcite .",
    "the average bound - zone velocity profile was shown by several numerical experiments to follow a power - law scaling @xcite .",
    "since the slope of the profile reflects how far and strongly the gravitational attraction of a massive group can resist the accelerating hubble flow , any departure of the real gravitational law from the gr would change the slope of the bound - zone velocity profile and accordingly the turn - around radius of the group . the question is whether or not the change would be detectable . in the current work ,",
    "we have conducted a numerical analysis to find a quantitative answer to this question .    with the help of the n - body simulations performed for two ndgp models ( df5 and df6 ) as well as for the standard @xmath0cdm + gr cosmology , we have measured the slopes of the average bound - zone velocity profiles around the massive groups with masses in the range of @xmath127 and found that the df5 ( gr ) model yields the lowest ( highest ) slope .",
    "our explanation for this result is that the gravitational attraction enhanced by the fifth force resists the hubble flow at larger distances , resulting in a milder decrease of the average bound - zone velocity profile with distance in the df5 model .",
    "we also have estimated the turn - around radii of the massive groups from the individual bound - zone velocity profiles for each model and calculated the odds of the bound - violations by counting the numbers of the massive groups whose estimated turn - around radii exceed the bound limit predicted by the gr+@xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "a @xmath1 signal of difference has been found in the odds of the bound - violations between the gr and the df5 models .",
    "our result implies that it is in principle possible to use the odds of the bound - violations as a complementary diagnostics to test locally the nature of gravity .",
    "this new diagnostics has a good advantage over the conventional ones .",
    "as explained well in @xcite , the estimate of the turn - around radius is not affected by complicated baryonic processes unlike the other local probes of gravity such as the redshift distortion effect , the n - point correlation functions , and cluster abundances .",
    "in other words , a direct comparison between the observational result and the theoretical prediction for the odds of the bound violations can be made without taking into account the non - gravitational effects of baryon physics that are hard to model theoretically due to their highly nonlinear aspect .",
    "furthermore , since the turn - around radius is a uniquely defined quasi - linear quantity , there is no ambiguity involved with the details of the way that it is estimated .",
    "moreover , @xcite have proven that the best - fit values of the amplitude and slope parameters , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , of equation ( [ eqn : vr ] ) are indeed insensitive to the variation of the key cosmological parameters within the gr+@xmath0cdm cosmology , which implies that the this new diagnostics is robust against the changes of the initial conditions in the standard picture .",
    "in other words , if the new diagnostics finds a tension with the prediction of the gr+@xmath0cdm cosmology , then it is quite unlikely that the tension can be alleviated by varying the key cosmological parameters or the baryon physics within the gr+@xmath0cdm cosmology , unlike the other local diagnostics .",
    "another promising aspect of this new diagnostics is that it has a power to distinguish among the mg models with different screening mechanisms .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown that the odds of the bound violations become larger if the odds are calculated from the bound - zone velocity profiles constructed along the filaments .",
    "in fact , in order to apply the routine of @xcite to real observational data for the estimate of the turn - around radius of a galaxy group , it is a prerequisite to find a filamentary structure in the bound zone and to construct the bound - zone velocity profile along the filament @xcite since the anisotropic distribution of the bound - zone galaxies along the filaments allow us to construct the bound - zone velocity profile without measuring accurately the peculiar velocities ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "according to @xcite , the fifth force in a filament remains intact by the vainshtein screening mechanism no matter how overdense the filamentary environment is while it can be completely shielded in the dense filamentary environment by the other screening mechanisms like the chameleon ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "thus , if the turn - around radii of the galaxy groups are determined from the bound - zone velocity profile constructed along the filaments via the routine of @xcite , the odds of the bound - violations would become different from the predictions of the gr+@xmath0cdm case only for the case of the vainshtein mechanism . to quantitatively verify this speculation",
    ", it will require n - body simulations with high resolution performed on a large volume for various mg models with different screening mechanisms , so that the dense filaments can be identified around massive groups from the simulation datasets .",
    "our future project will take off along this direction .",
