    "a mesa was first defined in the substrate by wet etching with an etchant based on @xmath65 .",
    "then , nbti was sputtered to form the superconducting electrodes on the mesa edges , following a procedure of wet etching to make the clean edge exposed , sulfur passivation to avoid oxidization of the edge , and in - situ ar plasma cleaning .",
    "finally a gate electrode metal of titanium and gold was deposited on top to address the low qh filling regime even under a low magnetic field .",

    "this fabrication procedure creates no superconducting material on the top surface of the mesa .",
    "this is specially devised to control the carrier density not only of the mesa but also near the junction using the top gate voltage ( discussed later ) .",

    ", we evaluate the critical field of @xmath57.0 t. herein , the coexistence of superconducting state and qh states can be realized if the 2deg is in the spin - resolved qh regime for @xmath67 t.      in fig .",

    "some theoretical works predict existence of spin - triplet superconducting proximity on such junctions which generate the dip structures  @xcite . in our case ,",
    "strong spin - orbit interaction on the interface can affect the superconducting proximity even at 0 t and invokes finite spin - flip process .",
    "therefore , we suspect that the dip structure may be related to the spin - triplet superconducting proximity even at 0 t.      we measured the conductance as functions of magnetic field and top gate voltage in order to estimate quality of our inas quantum hall effect and zeeman effect .",
    "figure [ figs2 ] shows the conductance as functions of @xmath33 and @xmath8 .",
    "as seen in this figure , clear quantized conductance plateaus appear at @xmath69  t and the zeeman splitting is found at @xmath70  t. 2.4 and 4 t is large enough to study the coexistence between the spin - resolved qh state and superconductor . furthermore , we measured the transconductance defined by the deviation of @xmath3 at 2.4 t. the results are plotted in fig .",

    ", there is a sub - gap feature with a small dip or gap - like structure .",
    "these results are similar to the sub - gap features observed for @xmath71 of fig .",
    "3(b ) and ( c ) in the main text . the estimated gap from these sub - gap features are nearly equal to the 0.35 mv calculated from the superconducting gap at 0 t. this supports our assumption in the main text that the spin - singlet superconducting proximity gap at 4 t is the same as the superconducting gap obtained at 0 t. we conclude that the qh edge states do nt contribute to the andreev reflection in the device .",
    "we executed the numerical calculation using the model in which we assume the two channels , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",

    "we constrict the fitting ranges for all the parameters , and especially we tightly constrict the @xmath38 and @xmath39 from the curve shapes . in order to reproduce the curve shape around the zero bias voltage",
    ", we changed the fitting range for each of the curves because the differential conductance of the 2deg appears as background and the conductance has a large dependence on the bias voltage near the plateau regime . due to this background dependence",
    ", we could not reproduce the curve shapes in the two lower curves of the left panel and middle panel , and the lowest curve of the right panel in fig.4(b ) of the main text . in these cases , we evaluated only @xmath38 and @xmath39 from the sub - gap peak features ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 are indicated on the panels in fig.4(b ) as open and closed hexagons ) .",
    "our fitting scheme includes many free parameters and results are sensitive to the constriction of the variable range .",
    "however , the estimated gap energies and @xmath40 produce relatively constant results with different fitting ranges , so we think it is valuable to discuss these parameters .",

    "as written in the main text , we analyzed our experimental data with the model to evaluate @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the superconducting gap energies .",
    "however , these values are enlarged from the true bulk and proximity superconducting gap energies due to dissipation induced from the bulk state of the mesa . in the plateau regime ,",
    "the transport is non - dissipative in the mesa , while the transport is dissipative in the plateau - transition regime due to the qh bulk state .",
    "herein , in the plateau - transition regime , applied @xmath4 between two superconductors is divided into the voltage on the junctions and on the mesa , then the deduced @xmath39 gives a larger gap energy as the contribution of the qh bulk state in the transport becomes larger .",

    "our results for @xmath40 and @xmath47 have a maximum and minimum , respectively , at @xmath86 .",
    "in this section , we estimate how large @xmath87 should be to make the bulk contribution have a maximum at @xmath86 .",
    "as the shape of our device is square , the two - terminal conductance is written by @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath89 and @xmath90 are the longitudinal conductivity and hall conductivity  @xcite , respectively .",
    "@xmath89 has a maximum when the bulk contribution is maximum and the situation is given by @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) , at which change in the filling factor @xmath93 is equal to 0.5 .",

    "the calculated longitudinal resistance should be obtained when the bulk contribution is maximum , meaning @xmath87 is maximum with the calculated resistance in the region corresponding to the plateau - transition regime .",

    "<S> this conductance enhancement arises from ar  @xcite and only appears for the bias voltage in the junction less than the superconducting bulk gap energy @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we evaluate the @xmath7 as approximately 0.35 mev . the observation of the sub - gap feature guarantees that the junction has enough quality to study ar between the superconductor and spin - resolved qh state .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1](e ) , @xmath4 to characterize the superconducting gap decreases as @xmath8 is made more positive . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 shift is due to the change in the voltage dropped over the junctions when the series resistance of the 2deg is altered . </S>",

    "<S> the effective junction voltage decreases as the carrier density of the qw decreases with decreasing @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> herein the applied voltage of @xmath4 is assumed to only drop across the junctions in the saturation region . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we evaluate @xmath14 mev . this @xmath7 is smaller than the value of 0.99 mev , predicted from the critical temperature with conventional bcs theory . </S>",
    "<S> a reduced @xmath7 has been reported in previous studies  @xcite , and assigned to the normal reflection in the junction as a possible origin . </S>",

    "<S> in addition to a center dip or peak structure we observe a side peak . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it is clear to see two side peaks at @xmath24 mv in addition to a peak at @xmath25 v for the curves at @xmath26 in the right panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](c ) .    the sub - gap conductance enhancement indicated by the observation of a zero - bias peak can be assigned to ar in the junction having a low potential barrier . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , if the potential barrier is so large that normal reflection is more dominant than ar , a dip rather than a peak can appear according to the blonder , tinkham , and klapwijk ( btk ) theory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we assign the peak ( dip ) structure observed in the plateau - transition regime to ar ( normal reflection ) , and then the change of the sub - gap feature in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( b ) and ( c ) can be simply explained by considering the change of the junction potential barrier depending on @xmath27 . for the transport through the qh state it is well established that the dominant contribution arises from the qh bulk state in the plateau - transition regime and from the qh edge state in the plateau regime . </S>",
    "<S> herein , we deduce that the sub - gap feature , especially the peak structure is originated from ar in the junction between the superconductor and the spin - resolved qh bulk state . </S>",
    "<S> a finite amount of equal - spin ar can be expected for a 2deg with strong spin - orbit interaction according to recent theoretical studies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we here assume coexistence of equal - spin ar and normal ar , corresponding to ar intermediated with and without a spin - flip process respectively , as schematically shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) .    in order to more quantitatively </S>",
    "<S> interpret the sub - gap features including the side peaks , we construct a model based on the btk theory . in this theory , the normalized differential conductance of the junction , @xmath28 , can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the fermi - dirac distribution function , temperature , superconducting gap and the dimensionless parameter representing the potential barrier in the junction , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32(@xmath33 ) is the probability of the equal - spin ar ( normal reflection ) defined in the btk theory  @xcite . </S>",
