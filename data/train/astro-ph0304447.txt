    "not so very long ago , people who studied clusters of galaxies were often asked how the x - ray emitting gas gets so hot .",
    "the answer is simple , of course .",
    "if radiative cooling is negligible , then gravitationally driven processes will heat diffuse gas to the virial temperature of the potential well that confines it .",
    "a tougher question would have been to ask why the intracluster medium has the density that it does . in order to answer that question",
    ", one needs to know what produces the entropy of the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "entropy is of fundamental importance because a cluster s intergalactic gas will convect until its isentropic surfaces coincide with the equipotential surfaces of the dark - matter potential .",
    "thus , the entropy distribution of a cluster s gas and the shape of the dark - matter potential well in which that gas sits completely determine the large - scale x - ray properties of a relaxed cluster of galaxies ( see voit 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "the gas density profile @xmath1 and temperature profile @xmath2 in this state of convective and hydrostatic equilibrium are just manifestations of the underlying entropy distribution . if we wish to link these x - ray observables to the process of cluster formation , we therefore need to understand how the growth of cosmic structure generates intracluster entropy and how processes like radiative cooling and non - gravitational heating by supernovae and active galactic nuclei modify that entropy distribution .",
    "one way to approach the problem of gravitationally driven entropy generation is through spherically symmetric numerical models of smooth accretion , in which gas passes through an accretion shock as it enters the cluster ( e.g. , knight & ponman 1997 ; tozzi & norman 2001 ) . if the incoming gas is cold , then the accretion shock is the sole source of intracluster entropy .",
    "if instead the incoming gas has been heated before passing through the accretion shock , then the mach number of the shock is smaller and the intracluster entropy reflects both the amount of preheating and the production of entropy at the accretion shock .    in reality , however , the accreting gas is lumpy , not smooth .",
    "incoming gas associated with accreting subhalos enters the cluster with a wide range of densities .",
    "there is no well - defined accretion shock but rather a complex network of shocks as different lumps of infalling gas mix with the intracluster medium of the main halo . yet , despite this complexity , numerical simulations of hierarchical structure formation show that the resulting entropy profile is similar to that found in the smooth accretion models ( borgani 2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "this paper outlines some simple analytical models designed to clarify the processes that determine the entropy of intracluster gas .",
    "as has become customary in this field , we will refer to @xmath3 as the `` entropy '' of the gas , while recognizing that the formal thermodynamic entropy per particle for a gas of non - interacting monatomic particles is @xmath4 where @xmath5 depends only on fundamental constants and the mixture of particle masses . because we express temperatures in energy units throughout the paper , boltzmann s constant",
    "is absorbed into @xmath6 and @xmath7 becomes a dimensionless quantity .",
    "the object of our investigation is to understand the origin of the intracluster entropy distribution @xmath8 , defined so that the inverse function @xmath9 is the mass of gas with entropy @xmath10 .",
    "section  [ sec - smoothcold ] computes the entropy distribution arising from smooth spherical accretion of cold gas .",
    "it presents a simple analytical formulation for smooth accretion relating the entropy distribution of a cluster directly to its mass accretion rate .",
    "the shape of the resulting entropy distribution is similar to that of simulated and observed clusters but its normalization is too large by a factor @xmath112 - 3 , indicating that inhomogeneities in the accreting gas must be taken into account .",
    "because of this difference between smooth accretion and inhomogeneous accretion , the normalization of the intracluster entropy profile reflects the lumpiness of the gas that accreted onto the cluster .    section  [ sec - smoothpre ] shows how preheating and radiative cooling change the entropy distribution produced by smooth accretion .",
    "we demonstrate that modest amounts of preheating raise the entropy distribution expected from cold accretion by an additive term proportional to the initial entropy of the incoming gas .",
    "however , large amounts of preheating , comparable to the characteristic entropy of the halo , suppress entropy production because they expand the intracluster medium and reduce the shock velocity at the accretion front . including simple corrections for preheating and radiative cooling yields analytical smooth - accretion models whose entropy distributions agree well with the numerical models of tozzi & norman ( 2001 )",
    ". however , the effects of preheating on hierarchical accretion are qualitatively different because preheating smooths the gas accreting onto a cluster , potentially boosting its postshock entropy much more than the simple additive correction applied to smooth accretion .",
    "section  [ sec - evidence ] presents evidence suggesting that accretion of baryons onto groups was smoother than accretion onto clusters .",
    "we show that groups must have significant entropy gradients .",
    "otherwise , the observed values of core entropy can not be reconciled with the observed x - ray luminosity - temperature ( @xmath12-@xmath6 ) relation .",
    "polytropic models consistent with both the core entropy and the @xmath12-@xmath6 relation imply that entropy levels in the outer parts of groups are @xmath112 - 3 times higher than expected from simulations without cooling or preheating and from self - similar scaling of clusters .",
    "these findings are consistent with existing observations of groups and suggest a transition from lumpy accretion to smooth accretion below a mass scale @xmath13 .",
    "section  [ sec - puzzle ] explores how the lumpiness of accreting gas determines the intracluster entropy distribution .",
    "we present a naive calculation applying simple accretion shocks to discrete accreting subhalos and show that this simple picture fails to produce enough entropy .",
    "we then consider what adjustments to the preshock density and preshock velocity would be needed to produce the proper amount of entropy through simple accretion shocks .",
    "however , the situation could well be more complicated than this because dense accreting lumps do not necessarily thermalize all their incoming kinetic energy within the accreting gas .",
    "we therefore generalize the idea of an accretion shock and investigate entropy production by dissipation of turbulence and relatively weak shocks created as accreting subhalos circulate within the intracluster medium . somehow the process of hierarchical accretion in the absence of preheating and radiative cooling produces self - similar entropy profiles in groups and clusters , and we assess the amount of heat input needed to preserve this self - similarity .",
    "if this heating mode is significant , then it can partially offset radiative cooling in the cores of clusters , and we suggest how to test for this effect using numerical simulations .",
    "section  [ sec - summary ] summarizes our findings .",
    "let us first consider the case of cold accreting gas , in which the pressure of the incoming gas is negligible .",
    "we will assume a spherically symmetric geometry , so that mass accretes in a series of concentric shells , each with baryon fraction @xmath14 , that initially comove with the hubble flow . in this simple model ,",
    "a shell that initially encloses total mass @xmath15 reaches zero velocity at the turnaround radius @xmath16 and falls back through an accretion shock at radius @xmath17 .",
    "we will find that the entropy distribution in this case is determined primarily by the rate at which matter accretes onto the cluster and yields an entropy distribution between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "because the cold accreting gas is effectively pressureless , the equations that determine the postshock entropy are @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the preshock gas density and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are postshock quantities",
    ". equations ( [ eq - tps ] ) and ( [ eq - rhops ] ) are restatements of the jump conditions for strong shocks , assuming that the postshock velocity is negligible in the cluster rest frame ( e.g. , landau & lifshitz 1959 ; cavaliere , menci , & tozzi 1997 ) , and equation ( [ eq - xi ] ) is strictly true only for cosmologies with @xmath24 .",
    "the postshock entropy produced by smooth accretion of cold gas at time @xmath25 is then @xmath26^{-2/3 }                   ( mt)^{2/3 }                \\nonumber \\ ; \\ ; ,    \\label{eq - kcold}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the universal baryon fraction .",
    "thus , the entropy profile arising from smooth accretion of cold gas depends entirely on the ratio @xmath28 and the accretion history @xmath29 .",
    "the ratio of the shock radius to the turnaround radius should remain nearly constant with time in the case of cold accretion .",
    "one standard approach to estimating the virial radius of a cluster is to assume that it is precisely equal to half the turnaround radius of the shell that is currently accreting . setting the shock radius equal to the virial radius defined in this way",
    "implies @xmath30 by definition .",
    "more generally , one can assume that the shock occurs at the radius @xmath31 within which the mean density is @xmath32 times the critical density @xmath33 .",
    "in that case , @xmath34 , where @xmath35^{1/2}$ ] in a flat cosmology .",
    "the corresponding turnaround radius can be found from the equation of motion @xmath36 in the limit of a vanishingly small cosmological constant @xmath37 , a bound shell obeys the familiar parametric solution @xmath38 $ ] , @xmath39 $ ] , with @xmath40^{1/3}$ ] for a shell that collapses to the origin at time @xmath41 .",
    "the solution for @xmath42 is not much different because the @xmath37 term is always small .",
    "the quantity @xmath43 is never greater than @xmath44 during the trajectory of any shell that has accreted by the present time , which is why we neglected any @xmath37-dependence in equation  ( [ eq - xi ] ) .",
    "the time to fall from @xmath45 to the origin is also negligible , so we obtain @xmath46 . in this paper , we will generally set @xmath47 , unless stated otherwise .",
    "the self - similar solution of bertschinger ( 1985 ) for cold accretion with @xmath48 and @xmath49 provides some support for these assumptions . in that model ,",
    "the radius of the accretion shock remains fixed at 0.347 times the radius of the shell that is currently turning around .",
    "because @xmath50 in the bertschinger solution and the shell turning around at time @xmath25 accretes at time @xmath51 , this model implies @xmath52 .    in a self - consistent model of a shock - bounded intracluster medium ,",
    "the ram pressure of infalling gas at the accretion shock must balance the thermal pressure at the outer boundary of the hydrostatic region ( i.e. , @xmath53 must be continuous across the accretion shock . )",
    "thus , the value of @xmath54 depends on both the accretion rate of the cluster and its internal structure .",
    "appendix  a develops self - consistent solutions for the equilibrium shock radius in the case of a polytropic equation of state and a time - varying accretion history .",
    "as long as the accreting gas is cold , we find that @xmath55 for the accretion histories considered in this paper .",
    "however , preheating of the accreting gas can drive @xmath54 much lower , as we will discuss in   [ sec - preheat ] .      because of the constancy of @xmath54 , the entropy distribution for cold , smooth accretion directly reflects the accretion history @xmath29 . a rough estimate of @xmath29 can be obtained from extended press - schechter theory ( bond 1991 ; bower 1991 ; lacey & cole 1993 ) . if we restrict our attention to virialized halos that are much more massive than the characteristic mass , then @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the power - law slope of the perturbation spectrum and @xmath58 is a function of the critical threshold for virialization @xmath59 and the growth function @xmath60 ( e.g. , lacey & cole 1993 ; voit & donahue 1998 ) . in a flat cosmology with @xmath61 at @xmath62 ,",
    "the approximation @xmath63 is accurate to within 6% from @xmath64 to @xmath62 . for the relevant range of power - spectrum indices ( @xmath65 ) ,",
    "we therefore find @xmath66 , with @xmath67 , yielding a power - law entropy distribution between @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "these simple relations agree well with those found by both spherically symmetric hydrodynamical calculations ( tozzi & norman 2001 ) and three - dimensional simulations ( borgani 2001 , 2002 ) .",

    "note that this slope generally remains between 1.0 and 1.3 but rises above that in the outer parts of lower - mass halos because of the diminishing accretion rate as @xmath25 approaches @xmath62 .",
    "the near linearity of the relation between @xmath87 and @xmath88 is what sets the effective polytropic index of intracluster gas outside the cluster core . because the underlying potential is nearly isothermal , the gas density scales approximately as @xmath89 , implying @xmath90",

    "the nearly linear slope of the entropy profile from the smooth accretion model is similar to that of the simulated cluster , but its normalization is too large . outside the core of the simulated cluster , we find @xmath135 , while the smooth accretion model with @xmath30 yields @xmath136 .",
    "dimensionless entropy in the model of tozzi & norman ( 2001 ) has an even higher normalization , @xmath137 for a @xmath78 cluster , as indicated by the short - dashed line ( see figure  [ ent_comp_all_2 ] ) .",

    "the remaining discrepancy at @xmath142 comes mostly from the preheating assumed by tozzi & norman ( 2001 ) , as we will discuss in   [ sec - preheat ] .     for twenty - four halos from a numerical simulation without radiative cooling or feedback .",

    "the most obvious explanation for the difference in normalization between the smooth accretion model and those derived from simulations and observations is that the accreting gas in a more realistic model would be lumpy , not smooth .",
    "any inhomogeneity in the density of gas accreting onto a cluster tends to reduce the mean post - accretion entropy , as long as the velocity of the accreting gas remains unchanged .",
    "the reduction occurs because the postshock entropy scales as @xmath151 and the mass - weighted mean value of @xmath21 is larger if there is any inhomogeneity , anisotropy , or unsteadiness in the accretion flow ( see appendix  b ) .",
    "this sensitivity of the postshock entropy to the density distribution of incoming material means that the entropy normalization of a cluster or group reflects the lumpiness of the gas that accreted onto it . in section  [ sec - evidence ]",
    "we will show that this effect may actually be important  the elevated normalization of entropy in groups suggests that accretion of baryons onto groups was smoother than accretion of baryons onto clusters .",
    "however , we will first continue with our analysis of smooth accretion in order to include preheating and cooling in the analytical model .",
    "many authors have argued that preheating of gas that accretes onto a cluster is needed to explain the observed slope of the @xmath12@xmath6 relation ( e.g. , kaiser 1991 ; evrard & henry 1991 ; navarro , frenk , & white 1995 ; cavaliere , menci , & tozzi 1997 ; balogh 1999 ; ponman 1999 ) . depending on how the analysis is done , the necessary amount of preheating ranges from @xmath152 to over @xmath153 , corresponding to @xmath154 to @xmath155 ( but see   [ sec - polyfloor ] ) .",

    "in particular , the mach number of the accretion shock is @xmath158 , meaning that production of postshock entropy depends on the level of preheating .    in this section",
    "we derive an entropy jump condition that accounts for preheating and outline how preheating affects the position of the shock radius , suppressing the postshock entropy . because radiative cooling can offset some of the effects of preheating , we also derive a simple approximation to treat cooling . then , we add both preheating and cooling to our simple analytical entropy profiles and compare them with the numerically modeled entropy profiles of tozzi & norman ( 2001 ) . because the analytical profiles closely match the numerically computed ones , we conclude that our analytical model is a good representation of smooth accretion .      a jump condition for entropy production when preheated gas passes through a shock",

    "the results of the previous two sections imply that the impact of preheating on lumpy accretion qualitatively differs from its impact on smooth accretion .",

    "preheating might actually _ enhance _ entropy generation over what would normally be produced in the lumpy accretion mode . because preheating tends to lower the density of gas within small halos , it smooths the density distribution accreting onto larger halos , increasing the efficiency with which accretion shocks generate entropy .",

    "however , @xmath303 grows arbitrarily small in the limit of @xmath325 and @xmath326 , in which case the majority of the gas becomes concentrated at high density .",

    ", one would need to measure the density distribution and infall velocity of baryonic material accreting onto a numerically simulated cluster and then compute the postshock entropy distribution implied by this model .",
    "an alternative solution to the entropy normalization problem depends on an important qualitative difference between smooth accretion and lumpy accretion .",
    "smooth accretion thermalizes all the incoming kinetic energy at the accretion shock , within gas that has just accreted .",
    "after a gas shell has become part of the intracluster medium , its entropy is no longer affected by the smooth - accretion process .",
    "however , dense lumps of accreting gas can penetrate the virial radius without substantially decelerating .",
    "they subsequently move through the main cluster , stirring up turbulence and stimulating shocks within the main cluster s gas .",
    "these processes continue until either drag saps all of the dense lump s kinetic energy or hydrodynamic instabilities tear the dense lump apart .    the recently observed presence of cold fronts in clusters ( markevitch 2000 ; vikhlinin , markevitch , & murray 2001 ) suggests that dense subhalos can remain coherent for quite a long time before blending with the rest of the intracluster medium .",
    "thus , much of the incoming kinetic energy of lumpy accretion may ultimately be deposited into the pre - existing intracluster medium as the disturbances stirred up by the accreting lumps dissipate and thermalize ( see e.g. , gomez 2002 ) .",
    "if that is the case , then accretion provides a distributed source of heating that adds entropy to the entire intracluster medium , not just to gas that has recently accreted .",
    "here we examine some crucial differences between entropy production through smooth accretion and entropy production through distributed heating .",
    "first we assess the amount of entropy growth that lumpy accretion needs to generate in order to maintain the self - similar entropy profiles observed in simulations and in hot clusters .",
    "then we examine the implications of heating the existing intracluster medium through lumpy accretion , showing that the source of condensing low - entropy gas in the lumpy - accretion mode is different from its origin in the smooth - accretion mode .",
    "if distributed heating is important , then much of the core gas in present - day clusters may come from the cores of subhalos that accrete at @xmath328 .",
    "one can assess the importance of distributed heating by tracking the @xmath329 trajectories of lagrangian gas parcels in numerical simulations after they accrete onto a cluster .",
    "one notable feature of numerically modelled clusters in simulated cdm - like cosmologies is their near self - similarity .",
    "the dark - matter potential wells approximately follow the nfw density profile , and the main systematic devations from self - similarity can be characterized with a halo concentration parameter that increases with decreasing halo mass ( e.g. , navarro 1997 ) .",
    "this dependence on halo mass comes about because smaller halos tend to accumulate their mass earlier in time , when the mean density of the universe is larger ( navarro 1997 ; bullock 2001 ; eke , navarro , & steinmetz 2001 ) .",
    "numerical models including hydrodynamics also show that the baryonic density and temperature profiles in the absence of non - gravitational heating and cooling processes closely track the analogous dark - matter profiles , except in the very center ( e.g. , navarro , frenk , & white 1995 ; eke 1998 ; frenk 1999 ) . therefore ,",
    "whatever processes are responsible for entropy growth during hierarchical structure formation act to preserve this near self - similarity .",

    "the entropy increase in this case is due entirely to shock heating of incoming gas at the accretion shock , and there are no additional heating terms .",

    "we construct a toy model for distributed heating owing to accretion and show how it affects the evolution of the intracluster entropy distribution . if distributed heating is the dominant mode of entropy growth , then the entropy of gas deep within a cluster should rise with time , possibly compensating for some of the radiative cooling of the cluster core .",

    "if this energy deposition rate were equal to the rate at which kinetic energy passes through the virial radius , then we would have @xmath354 .",

    "a dense gas blob eventually comes to rest when its entropy equals that of the surrounding gas .",

    "substantial amounts of preheating or internal feedback ( @xmath373 ) are necessary to prevent this gas from condensing .    in both scenarios ,",
    "the fate of a gas parcel accreting onto the cluster depends on where it enters the @xmath87-@xmath25 plane as it becomes incorporated into the intracluster medium .",
    "for example , if the core of an accreting subhalo does not gain enough entropy during the merger to exceed @xmath374 , then it will ultimately sink toward the center of the cluster and condense , unless some other heat source prevents it from doing so .",
    "the level of this threshold depends critically on @xmath355 , which is why this parameter should be measured using numerical simulations .",
    "sampling of the core gas in the simulations of navarro ( 1995 ) shows that @xmath329 indeed rises with time ( see their figure  8) , implying @xmath375 , but the data presented are insufficient for measuring the heating rate .",
    "if @xmath355 is close to the similarity - preserving value assumed in equation ( [ eq - epsilon ] ) , then the origin of `` cooling flow '' gas in hierarchical merging differs substantially from the smooth accretion case , in which the lowest - entropy gas is the earliest gas to accrete .",

    "shocks probably raise the entropy of this gas somewhat before it mixes with the intracluster medium , but the magnitude of this entropy increase is uncertain . tracking the entropy of gas parcels during a numerically simulated merger would help to quantify this important parameter .",

    "we have sought to understand its origin in terms of some simple analytical models .",
    "this analysis leads us to conclude the following :    1 .",
    "a classical smooth accretion shock produces an intracluster entropy distribution with a form much like the self - similar entropy profiles observed in both massive clusters and in simulations of hierarchical structure formation .",
    "however , the normalization of the entropy profile arising from smooth accretion is @xmath112 - 3 times higher , depending on the accretion rate .",
    "smooth , steady , isotropic accretion produces the maximum amount of entropy for a given @xmath377 because smoothing of the incoming gas minimizes the mean mass - weighted density entering the accretion shock (   [ sec - smoothcold ] ) .",
    "2 .   preheating smoothly accreting gas to an entropy level @xmath156 boosts the postshock entropy profile by an additive term @xmath171 , as long as the entropy of preheating does not exceed the characteristic entropy of the accreting halo (   [ sec - entjump ] ) .",
    "however , preheating that exceeds the characteristic entropy of the accreting halo strongly suppresses entropy production at the accretion shock because it inflates the intracluster medium , pushing the accretion shock well outside the virial radius and thereby reducing the shock velocity at the accretion front (   [ sec - preheat ] ) .",
    "3 .   because smooth accretion of cold or moderately preheated gas produces @xmath112 - 3 times more entropy than observed in both massive clusters and simulations , inhomogeneity of the incoming gas must play a role in setting the entropy level of the intracluster medium .",
    "this difference in entropy production between smooth accretion and hierarchical accretion allows for an interesting mode of similarity breaking .",
    "if preheating has been able to eject gas from the small subhalos accreting onto groups , then accretion of baryons onto groups may be smoother than accretion onto clusters , enhancing entropy production at the accretion shock (   [ sec - inhomopre ] ) .",
    "4 .   smoothing of gas associated with low - mass halos might explain some interesting differences between the entropy profiles of groups and clusters .",
    "isentropic groups can not satisfy the observed @xmath12-@xmath6 relation while having the observed core entropy @xmath232-@xmath378 (   [ sec - polyfloor ] ) .",
    "polytropic models of groups that satisfy both observational constraints have entropy gradients implying entropy levels at @xmath379 that substantially exceed what hierarchical accretion can produce (   [ sec - outskirts ] ) .",
    "direct observations indicate that entropy at the outskirts of groups is indeed @xmath112 - 3 times higher than values derived from self - similar scaling of clusters ( finoguenov 2002 ) , perhaps owing to a transition from lumpy accretion to smooth accretion occuring on group scales (   [ sec - smoothinterp ] ) .",
    "because the normalization of intracluster entropy appears to be sensitive to the density distribution of incoming gas , we would like to understand what sets that normalization in the case of hierarchical accretion .",
    "however , a naive model in which all the incoming energy is thermalized by shocks within subhalos having an average density similar to that of the main halo fails to produce enough entropy (   [ sec - discrete ] ) . 6 .   given the failure of this simple model to explain the observed normalization of the intracluster entropy distribution ,",
    "we are driven to consider more complex scenarios for entropy generation .",
    "one possibility is that some of the accreting gas is not contained within subhalos , so that the incoming density distribution is intermediate between smooth accretion and the assumptions of   [ sec - discrete ] .",
    "another possibility is that some of the incoming kinetic energy is thermalized within the existing intracluster medium through shocks and turbulence stimulated as accreting gas lumps circulate through the cluster (   [ sec - heating ] ) .",
    "if the kinetic energy of accretion is indeed an important source of distributed heating within a cluster , then the development of entropy in the lumpy accretion case is qualitatively different from the smooth accretion case in which all entropy is generated at the accretion shock and is deposited exclusively into the accreting gas .",

    "<S> the entropy distribution of the intracluster medium and the shape of its confining potential well completely determine the x - ray properties of a relaxed cluster of galaxies , motivating us to explore the origin of intracluster entropy and to describe how it develops in terms of some simple models . </S>",
    "<S> we present an analytical model for smooth accretion , including both preheating and radiative cooling , that links a cluster s entropy distribution to its mass accretion history and shows that smooth accretion overproduces the entropy observed in massive clusters by a factor @xmath0 - 3 , depending on the mass accretion rate . </S>",
    "<S> any inhomogeneity in the accreting gas reduces entropy production at the accretion shock ; thus , smoothing of the gas accreting onto a cluster raises its entropy level . because smooth accretion produces more entropy than hierarchical accretion , we suggest that some of the observed differences between clusters and groups may arise because preheating smooths the smaller - scale lumps of gas accreting onto groups more effectively than it smooths the larger - scale lumps accreting onto clusters </S>",
    "<S> . this effect may explain why entropy levels at the outskirts of groups are @xmath0 - 3 times larger than expected from self - similar scaling arguments . </S>",
    "<S> the details of how the density distribution of accreting gas affects the entropy distribution of a cluster are complex , and we suggest how to explore the relevant physics with numerical simulations . </S>"
