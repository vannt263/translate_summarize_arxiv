    "entanglement is an important resource in quantum information theory . therefore , the possibility to detect whether or not a given state is entangled is of significant importance . for multipartite systems",
    ", there are inequivalent types of entanglement .",
    "a given task generally requires a certain type ( or class ) of entanglement , and therefore also class - specific detection of entanglement is important .    a common scheme to classify multi - party quantum states is to consider their equivalence with respect to stochastic local operations and classical communication ( slocc )  @xcite . the simplest multipartite case with several entanglement classes is a system consisting of three qubits for which dr _ et al .",
    "_ have identified six different slocc classes of pure states , and especially two different classes of `` true '' tripartite entanglement , the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) class and the @xmath0 class .",
    "the representative states of these classes are the standard ghz state @xmath1 and the @xmath0 state @xmath2 which both are invariant under qubit permutations .    this classification can be extended to mixed states  @xcite .",
    "it reveals that there is a linear hierarchy of entanglement classes . in this hierarchy",
    ", the ghz class represents the `` highest '' entanglement type , followed by the @xmath0 class , the biseparable states @xmath3 , and finally the fully separable states @xmath4 so that we have @xmath5 . as ghz - class states , to the set @xmath6 as @xmath0-class states , and to @xmath7 as the biseparable states .",
    "] mixing states of a higher class can result in a state of a lower class , but not vice versa .",
    "an obvious example is that of equally mixing the elements of an orthogonal basis of ghz states ( ghz type ) , which gives the completely mixed state ( fully separable ) .",
    "note that , by definition , each set of states which has _ at most _ a given entanglement type is always convex .",
    "the standard method to detect the slocc class of a given state are entanglement witnesses  @xcite , see also  @xcite and references therein . despite the impressive progress in entanglement theory during the past decade  @xcite , to date",
    "there is still no method which could determine the slocc class of an arbitrary three - qubit state with certainty .",
    "therefore , exact results for special families of states are important towards a better insight into the structure of the space of mixed quantum states .",
    "one way of obtaining such results is the reduction of the number of free parameters by introducing certain symmetry requirements  @xcite .",
    "recently , a complete characterization of the entanglement type in the family of three - qubit ghz - symmetric states has been achieved  @xcite . that family contains in particular the important case of pseudo - pure ghz states , that is",
    ", mixtures @xmath8 of the ghz state ( [ eq : ghz ] ) and the state @xmath9 , moreover @xmath10 .",
    "the state @xmath11 is fully unpolarized and is often regarded as a model for white noise .",
    "however , in experiments one can not always assume white noise , and for more general admixtures the resulting state will not be ghz symmetric .",
    "therefore , methods are required to determine the entanglement class of such states .",
    "a possible strategy is to select certain subsets of mixed states which lead to a more adequate representation of a given type of noise and allows for a more precise determination of an experiment - specific optimal witness .",
    "this is the approach that we pursue in this article . to this end",
    ", we first review the properties of ghz - symmetric three - qubit states .",
    "subsequently , we explain the usefulness of witnesses whose optimality is restricted to certain subsets  @xcite",
    ". finally we explicitly demonstrate how ghz - symmetric states may serve to find better witnesses for pseudo - pure states , in particular for the mixtures in equation  ( [ eq : pseudo - pure ] ) .",
    "in this section , we summarize the properties of ghz - symmetric three - qubit states  @xcite . in addition , we determine the set of ghz - symmetric states with positive partial transpose .",
    "density matrices with ghz symmetry are invariant under unitary transformations , denoted _ ghz symmetry operations _ , which leave the standard ghz state equation  ( [ eq : ghz ] ) unchanged : + _ ( i ) _ arbitrary qubit permutations , + _ ( ii ) _ simultaneous three - qubit flips ( i.e. , application of @xmath12 ) , + _ ( iii ) _ correlated qubit rotations about the @xmath13 axis of the form @xmath14 here , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are pauli operators .",
    "note that the operations _ ( i)(iii ) _ do not change the entanglement of an arbitrary three - qubit state .",
    "the ghz - symmetric three - qubit states can be parametrized as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the projector onto state @xmath19 and we have defined the ghz@xmath20 states @xmath21 the @xmath22 coordinate ranges in the interval @xmath23 while , for given @xmath22 , the @xmath24 coordinate may assume values @xmath25 .",
    "the states thus form a plane triangle ( shown in fig .",
    "1 ) with corners @xmath26 corresponding to ghz@xmath27 , @xmath28 corresponding to ghz@xmath29 , and @xmath30 which represents the state @xmath31 .",
    "the completely mixed state is located at the origin @xmath32 .",
    "( yellow ) , biseparable ( green ) , and separable ( blue ) . at the origin",
    ", there is the state @xmath9 .",
    "the solid magenta line illustrates the pseudo - pure states ( [ eq : pseudo - pure ] ) . ]",
    "the ghz - symmetric states provide an example to observe the hierarchy of entanglement classes mentioned in the introduction .",
    "a ghz - symmetric state is fully separable iff it is in the polygon defined by the four corner points @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( the blue area in fig .  1 ) .",
    "correspondingly , it is at most biseparable iff it is in the polygon with corners @xmath33 , @xmath37 , @xmath35 and @xmath38 ( the green area in fig .  1 ) .",
    "a state is at most of @xmath0 type ( yellow in fig .",
    "1 ) iff its coordinates lie in the convex area enclosed by the lower edges of the triangle and the curve @xmath39 given by @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "all these boundary lines belong to the lower of the two entanglement classes which they separate ( note that the fully separable state @xmath42 corresponding to @xmath43 is part of all three boundaries ) .",
    "an arbitrary state @xmath44 can be projected onto the set of ghz - symmetric states by the twirling operation @xmath45 where the integral is understood to include also averaging over the discrete symmetries , and @xmath46 is the haar measure for the ghz symmetry group .",
    "the coordinates of the symmetrized state are @xmath47 since ghz symmetry operations do not change the entanglement class , and mixing can result only in the same or a lower class , the entanglement class of @xmath48 is at most that of @xmath44 .",
    "now we determine the set of ghz - symmetric states with positive partial transpose ( ppt ) . due to the permutation invariance of the matrix",
    "it does not matter which partition we use for the partial transpose . to identify the ppt states",
    ", we note that the only non - diagonal elements of @xmath49 are @xmath50 .",
    "a partial transpose obviously does not modify the diagonal elements , however it moves those non - diagonal elements along the anti - diagonal . since the diagonal elements of a density matrix are always positive , the only eigenvalues which can be negative are those of the @xmath51 submatrix containing @xmath24 , that is , @xmath52 the two eigenvalues of this matrix are @xmath53 , and they are both nonnegative exactly for the polygon of fully separable states",
    "an alternative way to obtain this result would have been the criterion by kay  @xcite .",
    "linear entanglement witnesses are an important tool to detect entanglement  @xcite , see also  @xcite and references therein .",
    "they are defined as hermitean operators @xmath54 whose expectation value @xmath55 is positive for all unentangled states , but negative for some entangled states .",
    "if , for some state @xmath44 , the expectation value of @xmath54 is negative the witness is said to detect @xmath44 .",
    "there exists a straightforward extension of this concept to class - specific entanglement  @xcite : the expectation value of a class - specific witness is positive for any state not belonging to the corresponding entanglement class or classes , and negative for some states in those entanglement classes .",
    "for example , a witness for ghz - type entanglement is negative only for states containing ghz - type entanglement .",
    "a useful property of linear entanglement witnesses is that they can be specified , up to an irrelevant positive factor , solely by the set of states for which they vanish , _",
    "i.e. _ , a hyperplane in the space of density matrices .",
    "this is derived directly from the corresponding property of general hermitean operators by noting that the expectation value of the completely mixed state must be positive .    to simplify terminology ,",
    "in the following we will refer to states of the entanglement type(s ) which we want to detect as `` interesting '' , whereas we will call the states which are unentangled or have the `` wrong '' type of entanglement `` uninteresting '' , respectively . in this spirit , the uninteresting states will always be those whose entanglement type is  too low ",
    "according to the hierarchy given in the introduction , and therefore the set of uninteresting states will always be convex .",
    "an important goal is to find _ optimal _ entanglement witnesses , that is , witnesses which detect as many states as possible .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite defined a witness @xmath54 to be optimal if there is no other witness which detects all the states detected by @xmath54 and also some other states not detected by @xmath54 .",
    "of course , this definition applies to class - specific witnesses as well .    however , an optimal witness as defined above is not necessarily _ optimal for a given set_. this is because a certain state may be detected by different optimal witnesses .",
    "for example , we will see that there are many optimal witnesses detecting the standard ghz state , but almost all of them are _ not _",
    "optimal for detecting the pseudo - pure states in equation  ( [ eq : pseudo - pure ] ) .",
    "that is , there exist such mixtures which are of ghz type , but which are not detected by those globally optimal witnesses .",
    "for this reason , we specifically study witnesses that are optimal _ for a given ( convex ) set of states_. this concept has been investigated by hulpke _ et al .",
    "_ in ref .",
    "to define such a witness , the definition by lewenstein _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite can be modified to consider only the states in that particular set . in the important case of mixtures of",
    "a given highly entangled state , such as ghz , with some sort of noise described by another state , the relevant set is just a straight line in the space of density matrices ( typically , with the entangled state in the interesting class , and the noise in the uninteresting class ) . in that case",
    ", this definition reduces to the simple criterion : a witness is optimal on a given line if there is no interesting state on that line for which the expectation value of the witness is positive ( cf .  also fig .  2 ) .",
    "note that , using the definition above , a witness which is optimal for a given set needs not be globally optimal : if the `` mixture line '' crosses a corner in the boundary of uninteresting states , for that point there will be generally more than one witness fulfilling the restricted optimality condition .",
    "if , in addition , that state is also on the boundary of the set of all states , it may happen that not all of those witnesses are globally optimal ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "however , there is always a witness which is both optimal for a given set and globally optimal .",
    "importantly , for any convex subset @xmath56 of the set @xmath57 of all states , every witness @xmath54 which is both optimal with respect to the subset @xmath56 and vanishes on at least one full - rank state in @xmath56 , is also globally optimal ( i.e. , with respect to @xmath57 ) .",
    "this can be seen as follows : if the witness @xmath54 were not globally optimal , there would be another witness @xmath58 that detects all the interesting states in @xmath57 detected by @xmath54 , and then some more .",
    "let @xmath44 be such a state with @xmath59 , i.e. , @xmath44 is not located at the detection border of @xmath54 .",
    "since @xmath54 is optimal for @xmath60 , both witnesses must detect exactly the same states in @xmath60 .",
    "now consider a full - rank state @xmath61 so that @xmath62 ( which implies @xmath63 ) , and the set of density matrices @xmath64 with real parameter @xmath65 .",
    "since @xmath66 is of full rank , @xmath67 is still a density matrix for sufficiently small negative @xmath65 .",
    "however for @xmath68 , the state is detected by @xmath54 but not by @xmath58 , in contradiction to the assumption .",
    "of states which is a union of the disjoint sets of `` interesting '' and `` uninteresting '' states ( indicated by green and blue regions , respectively ) . moreover , the circle represents a convex subset of states @xmath69 , and the right - lower border of the figure another convex subset @xmath70 .",
    "the orange line @xmath71 shows a generic witness in @xmath57 ( not optimal with respect to any set ) while the red line @xmath72 stands for a witness which is both globally optimal in @xmath57 and also optimal with respect to subset @xmath60 ( but not with respect to @xmath73 ) .",
    "the brown line @xmath74 is an example for a witness which is optimal with respect to the border @xmath73 but _ not _ globally optimal ( and also not optimal with respect to the circle @xmath60 ) . ]",
    "we are specifically interested in witnesses that are optimal for the subset of ghz - symmetric states .",
    "these states form a plane triangle that contains the completely mixed state . hence",
    ", for any witness @xmath54 detecting a ghz - symmetric state , the set of ghz - symmetric states with @xmath75 is a straight line .",
    "as we will see , all those witnesses vanish on at least one full - rank ghz - symmetric state , and are therefore also globally optimal .",
    "we now consider a special set of witnesses , the ghz - symmetric witnesses , which are defined by the condition that for any ghz symmetry operation @xmath76 , we have @xmath77 .",
    "it is easy to see that such witnesses must have the form @xmath78 the set of states for which the ghz - symmetric witness has zero expectation value is then computed as @xmath79 the reverse is also true : for any straight line which does not cross the set of uninteresting states , there exists a corresponding ghz - symmetric witness which is unique up to a positive factor .",
    "_ proof : _ from equation ( [ eq : witnessline ] ) , it is immediately obvious that for each line , there exists ( up to a real factor ) exactly one ghz - symmetric hermitean operator whose expectation value vanishes on that line .",
    "the condition that for the fully separable state @xmath11 at the origin the witness has positive expectation value fixes the sign via the inequality @xmath80 .",
    "next we show that any such line which does not cross the set of uninteresting states corresponds to an entanglement witness .",
    "to see this , consider a state @xmath44 which is detected by the ghz - symmetric operator @xmath54 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath81",
    ". then the symmetrized state @xmath48 is also detected by @xmath54 , since @xmath82 .",
    "now @xmath48 is an interesting state because it lies on the side of the line which is opposite to the completely mixed state , and the line by assumption does not cross the set of uninteresting states . as the entanglement class of @xmath44 is at least that of @xmath48 , the state @xmath44 must also be an interesting state , which completes our proof .    from this one - to - one correspondence between the straight lines considered in the proof above and ghz - symmetric witnesses",
    "one also sees that for any witness detecting ghz - symmetric states , there is ( up to a positive factor ) a unique ghz - symmetric witness which detects exactly the same ghz - symmetric states .",
    "therefore , in order to find witnesses that are optimal for ghz - symmetric states , it is justified to consider only ghz - symmetric witnesses . from fig .",
    "1 it is readily seen that a witness is optimal for ghz - symmetric states iff it is tangential to the border of uninteresting states .",
    "this is sufficient knowledge for the explicit construction of witnesses which are optimal for ghz - symmetric states .",
    "since the set of ghz - symmetric states is symmetric under the local unitary operation @xmath83 corresponding to @xmath84 , it suffices to consider witnesses which detect states with @xmath85 ( since all the states @xmath86 are fully separable , there exist no witnesses detecting states with both signs of @xmath24 ) .",
    "the corresponding witness for @xmath87 can be constructed by simply exchanging @xmath88 and @xmath89 in equation  ( [ eq : ghzsymmetricwitness ] ) .",
    "we start with the detection of states which are not separable , that is , the interesting states are those containing any type of entanglement , while the uninteresting states are the fully separable ones . here",
    "the border is the straight line through the points @xmath34 and @xmath43 , which has the equation @xmath90 from this , together with equation  ( [ eq : witnessline ] ) , the unique optimal witness ( with respect to the ghz - symmetric states ) @xmath91 is derived .",
    "next we consider the detection of tripartite entanglement , _",
    "i.e. _ , the interesting states are ghz and @xmath0 states , while the uninteresting states are the biseparable and fully separable ones .",
    "we mention that this case was studied extensively for various multipartite systems in refs .",
    "the border between those two is again a straight line , with the equation @xmath92 in analogy with the preceding case , we obtain the unique optimal witness @xmath93 this witness was actually found a long time ago  @xcite . it is known to be globally optimal .    finally , we study witnesses detecting ghz - type states . here",
    "the boundary is given by equation ( [ eq : ghzwborder ] ) , which is a convex curve .",
    "thus , each tangent to this curve corresponds to a witness which is optimal for mixtures of the ghz state and a state on the axis @xmath94 ( and , since those mixtures have full rank , also globally for all three - qubit states ) .    due to the finite curvature of that boundary , the parameters of these witnesses depend on the point @xmath95 where the `` mixing line '' intersects the boundary .",
    "the tangent to curve ( [ eq : ghzwborder ] ) at parameter value @xmath96 is given by the equation @xmath97 from this , we obtain for the coefficients of the optimal witness @xmath98 where @xmath65 has to be chosen such that @xmath99 . inserting ( [ eq : ghzwborder ] ) , together with an appropriate choice of @xmath65 gives @xmath100 for the important case of the standard ghz state mixed with white noise , equation  ( [ eq : pseudo - pure ] ) , the mixing line crosses the boundary at @xmath101 and thus the optimal witness in that case reads @xmath102 it is instructive to compare this with the projection witness @xmath103 this witness , which happens to be ghz diagonal as well , is derived from the @xmath0-type state with maximum overlap to ghz , which is @xmath104 ( here @xmath105 ) .",
    "the image of the symmetrized state @xmath106 is located at the point @xmath107 in the triangle of fig .  1 where the ghz/@xmath0 boundary reaches the lower - right border .",
    "this state has vanishing expectation value for the projection witness ( [ eq : ghzpwitness ] ) , therefore the projection witness is optimal for the lower - right border of the triangle , that is , for mixtures of ghz with @xmath108 .",
    "however , it is _ not _",
    "optimal for the entire set of ghz - symmetric states , as can easily be seen by calculating the optimal witness from equation ( [ eq : ghzwitness ] ) .",
    "since at the right border , @xmath109 , the optimal witness for all ghz - symmetric states is @xmath110 this witness detects more ghz - symmetric ghz - type states than the projection witness ( [ eq : ghzpwitness ] ) .",
    "in this article , we have described how the two - parameter family of three - qubit ghz - symmetric states  whose slocc classes of entanglement are known exactly  can be used to derive optimal witnesses for the slocc classes of general three - qubit states . to this end , we have studied in detail the concept of optimal witnesses with respect to a certain subset of states , introduced in  @xcite .",
    "we have derived analytically the solutions for a bisperability witness , a witness of genuine three - qubit entanglement and a family of optimal witnesses for ghz - type entanglement .",
    "our findings confirm ( witness for genuine entanglement ) and improve ( detection of ghz - type vs.  @xmath0-type class ) the results for the well - known three - qubit entanglement witnesses .",
    "in particular , our approach produces a simple one - parameter optimization scheme for witnessing ghz - type entanglement in noisy ghz states that can be applied for the assessment of three - qubit entanglement in experimentally measured density matrices .",
