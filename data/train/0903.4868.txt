    "because of its importance in natural phenomena and industrial processes , fragmentation is of great interest . to a certain extent ,",
    "fragmentation phenomena depend on the particular features of the object that is broken .",
    "however , some generic behaviours seem to be shared by fragmenting systems whatever their size , material , or typical interaction energy . for instance , as observed in a large variety of experiments @xcite and natural phenomena @xcite , the fragment size distribution frequently exhibits a power law behaviour , the origin of which is still unknown .    despite its simple and rather everyday aspect , fragmentation is a complex and distinctly far - from - equilibrium process which makes it difficult to understand theoretically .",
    "attempts have been made to derive a power law distribution using analytical models , such as sequential fragmentation @xcite and energy - balance theory @xcite .",
    "however , these approaches do not succeed in explaining the variety of values of the power law exponent observed in experiments . on the other hand , fragmentation is beneficially studied with computer simulations @xcite . indeed , this approach can grasp the complexity and the dynamical properties of fragmentation by taking into account the various parameters that may influence the process  and consider even them one by one .",
    "the main goal of our studies is to highlight and understand the behaviours observed in a wide range of different fragmenting systems . to encompass this variety",
    ", we recently proposed an elementary molecular dynamics ( md ) model @xcite which , due to its simplicity , provides a very generic frame of reference for fragmentation studies .",
    "therefore , this model is not representative of any specific material",
    ". we applied it to investigate the fragmentation of a two - dimensional disc of interacting particles upon impact with a wall @xcite .",
    "one of the main results of this study is , that the power law exponent of the fragment size distribution increases logarithmically with the energy deposited in the system .",
    "this behaviour is in agreement with experimental results @xcite and we expect it to be generic for fragmentation phenomena .    in the present paper ,",
    "we extend this study by addressing the issue of damage occurring in a fragmenting disc .",
    "in particular , we will show how the breaking of bonds at the microscopic level is related to macroscopic quantities such as the fragment size distribution .",
    "dynamical quantities dealing with the spreading of damage during the fragmentation process will also be discussed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe the model and the simulation procedure ; in section 3 we review the main results concerning the fragment size distribution ; section 4 is devoted to the study of damage ; in section 5 we discuss the fragmentation energy .",
    "we conclude in section 6 .",
    "in the present study , the fragmenting system is a disc made up of @xmath4 particles placed on a two - dimensional triangular lattice . in the previous article @xcite , we showed by a finite size scaling approach that the fragmentation features of the system are not sensitive to the number of particles .",
    "the cohesion of the system is ensured by a central two - body lennard - jones type of potential @xmath5.\\ ] ] here @xmath6 is the distance between particles @xmath7 and @xmath8 and the two constants , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , are the depth of the potential well and the diameter of the particles , respectively .",
    "the three parameters , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , were chosen to obtain a strong repulsion at contact and a very short range of attraction ( around @xmath14 in addition to the particle diameter ) .",
    "these are the features that one expects to be dominant within a brittle solid at mesoscopic scales .",
    "note that the behaviour of the system under fragmentation is not sensitive to a particular choice of the parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , that is , to the range of attraction @xcite .",
    "the fragmentation process was studied by means of 2d molecular dynamics simulations utilizing the verlet algorithm  @xcite at constant energy .",
    "the time step is chosen as @xmath18 , ensuring the conservation of total energy up to 0.001 @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 is the unit of time and @xmath21 the particle mass . in the following , times",
    ", lengths , velocities , and energies are expressed in the units of @xmath22 , @xmath10 , @xmath23 , and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "the disc of diameter @xmath24 is constructed , rotated by a random angle and launched into a solid wall with a given impact velocity @xmath25 .",
    "the particles of the disc interact with the wall through the repulsive part of the potential @xmath26 ( for details , see @xcite ) . for each value of the impact velocity",
    ", we performed 1000 runs while sampling the initial angle of rotation uniformly .",
    "simulations were stopped at @xmath27 ( i.e. after @xmath28 md time steps ) , when the fragmentation process had already reached a steady state @xcite .    during the simulation ,",
    "fragments are defined as self - bound clusters of particles  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "two particles are bonded if their relative kinetic energy is lower than the absolute value of their interaction energy .",
    "once the distance @xmath29 between two particles @xmath7 and @xmath8 becomes larger than the attractive range ( @xmath30 ) of the potential , their potential energy is set from @xmath9 to @xmath31 .",
    "this value reduces the interaction between these two particles to an almost repulsive one and thus the possible recombination is prevented .    in this article",
    ", we measure the energy deposited in the system with a dimensionless control parameter @xmath32 , defined as the ratio of the initial kinetic energy to the potential energy of the disc : @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the initial potential energy per particle in the disc . when the kinetic energy is large enough compared to the cohesion of the disc",
    ", fragmentation occurs .",
    "the same numerical experiment  a disc of interacting particles fragmenting upon impact with a wall  has been previously investigated by means of more complex models .",
    "for instance , thornton and his collaborators @xcite used primary particles interacting through autoadhesive and frictional forces that act as functions of contact area .",
    "the particles , set initially in random locations , are pulled together by applying a centripetal force .",
    "hence in their model , the fragmenting agglomerate has an irregular shape and contains inherent structural defects .",
    "likewise , in the model proposed by kun , herrmann , and their collaborators @xcite , the primary particles are rigid randomly shaped convex polygons .",
    "these polygons are connected with beams that take into account elastic , shear , and torque interactions .",
    "the asset of the present study is the use of a minimal fragmentation model since it provides a generic frame of reference to which one can compare the effects of different parameters .",
    "accordingly , the system considered in this article is perfectly ordered and homogeneous , but disorder and heterogeneities could be easily taken into account to investigate their effects .",
    "for a given amount of energy deposited in the system , we calculated the fragment size distribution  the number @xmath35 of fragments made up of @xmath36 particles  averaged over 1000 runs .",
    "in addition to this , we calculated the normalized mean size of the largest and the second largest fragment  @xmath37 and @xmath38  as well as the total number of fragments @xmath39 .",
    "these last quantities are plotted in fig .",

    "when the amount of energy deposited in the system is larger than this threshold value @xmath42 , the fragment size distribution exhibits a power law behaviour with an exponent @xmath43 : @xmath44 .     and @xmath45 , and the total number of fragments @xmath46 as functions of @xmath32 at time @xmath27 .",

    "@xcite , which are based on the method of maximum likelihood .",
    "note that , as @xmath32 increases to values much larger than @xmath42 , the power law region of @xmath35 narrows due to the finite size of the fragmenting disc , and the determination of @xmath43 becomes difficult .",

    "[ fig:2 ] , the exponent @xmath43 of the power law exhibits a logarithmic increase with the energy deposited in the system : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "when @xmath43 is given as a function of the impact velocity , the coefficients @xmath54 and @xmath55 are slightly different than those obtained in the previous article @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in the present paper , we use a more rigorous method @xcite for fitting .",
    "similar to the size of the largest fragment , the total number of fragments @xmath56 is a measure of the degree of break - up in the fragmentation process .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] displays also @xmath39 as a function of @xmath32 .",
    "as expected , the total number of fragments increases with the initial kinetic energy .",
    "moreover , @xmath39 presents a linear behaviour with @xmath32 for @xmath57 , and a logarithmic behaviour for @xmath58 , that is , up to the highest impact energies considered in this work : @xmath59 here @xmath60 , i.e. , the same coefficient as for @xmath43 , and @xmath61 .",
    "note that behera _",
    "_ @xcite found the same linear and logarithmic behaviours while studying the impact fragmentation of a disc with a more sophisticated model , that takes into account also the elastic , shear and torque interactions between particles .",
    "the fragment size distribution discussed in the previous section reflects the degree of damage caused by the impact .",
    "furthermore , the increase of the total number of fragments with the impact velocity would be , and is , a direct and intuitive representation of increasing damage",
    ". however , both of these are macroscopic quantities .",
    "the microscopic level of the process is of greater interest if we want to understand how the fragmentation occurs . in our model ,",

    "each dot represents a bond between two particles localized at its initial position before the impact .",
    "the horizontal wall is depicted at the bottom of the top left figure . _ _ ]    at low initial kinetic energy ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) , the disc suffers mainly from internal damage .",
    "some internal bonds are broken and a few fragments are formed , mainly monomers in the impact zone ( bottom of the figure ) .",
    "oblique lines of broken bonds starting from the impact zone can be seen . as the energy deposited in the system increases ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) , oblique cracks propagate through the system from the impact zone to the edge of the disc and fragmentation in the proper sense of the word occurs .",
    "the largest fragment is localized in the top part of the disc .",
    "most of the energy is dissipated in the impact zone , producing quantities of monomers . at higher energies",
    "( @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) , cracks perpendicular to the former oblique ones form and create smaller fragments by merging . as energy increases further ,",
    "fragments become smaller but are of various sizes , in qualitative agreement with a power law fragment size distribution .",
    "it is interesting to note , that the shape of the fragments is irregular and rough without memory of the underlying triangular lattice structure of the disc . to conclude , the crack patterns shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] are consistent with the ones obtained with more complex models @xcite .    to quantify the damage produced during the impact fragmentation , thornton and his collaborators @xcite defined the damage ratio @xmath68 as the average ratio of the number of broken bonds at a given time @xmath69 , to the total number of initial bonds in the disc .",
    "this definition of damage is quite natural at a microscopic scale and can be easily applied to many kinds of fragmenting systems . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] we plot the damage ratio for various impact velocities . at the moment of impact ( @xmath70 ) , @xmath68 first increases dramatically , then at a slower rate , and eventually tends to its final value @xmath71 , showing that the fragmentation process reaches a steady state .",

    "( @xmath76 ) .",
    "each dot represents a bond between two particles placed at its initial position before the impact .",
    "_ _ ]    this evolution is further illustrated by the snapshots in fig [ fig:5 ] of the fragmenting disc for the impact velocity @xmath48 ( @xmath77 ) . just after the impact , at @xmath78 , two oblique cracks start to propagate from the impact zone . at @xmath79 ,",
    "damage increases in the impact zone and the oblique cracks become wider and continue their advance through the disc . as a consequence the damage rate increases swiftly . when the two cracks have reached the edge of the disc ,",
    "the damage rate is maximal .",
    "then , cracks perpendicular to the oblique ones are formed ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "damage spreads into the disc and damage rate decreases ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the local minimum of the damage rate ( @xmath82 ) is due to a sudden increase of the kinetic energy per particle ( not shown ) when the disc rebounds , after being compressed ( this is observed also for higher impact velocities , see the curve for @xmath83 ) . finally",
    ", bond breakings create fragments whose surfaces evolve by evaporating particles ( @xmath84 ) . as can be seen by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] at @xmath85 and fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] at @xmath27 , fragments already have their overall shape at @xmath86 .",
    "note that the lattice structure influences the first oblique crack propagation .",
    "however , these linear cracks are not sufficient to dissipate the impact energy and secondary winding cracks form within the disc without revealing the underlying lattice structure .    as illustrated by the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , as the impact velocity increases , the damage rate increases faster and reaches a maximal value when the oblique cracks have propagated through the system .",
    "the position of the peak depends only slightly on the energy deposited in the system , while it is mostly determined by the direction of propagation of the cracks .",
    "indeed , as the speed of sound in the disc is estimated to be around 100 @xcite , a crack of length @xmath87 ( the diameter of the disc ) reaches the edge at time @xmath88 .",
    "this is in agreement with the position of the peaks in fig .",

    "as illustrated by the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , the final damage ratio @xmath71 is very well fitted by a logarithmic function for @xmath90 , or equivalently for @xmath91 : @xmath92 here @xmath93 , i.e. , almost the same coefficient as for @xmath43 and for @xmath94 . for higher energies ( @xmath95 )",
    ", @xmath71 grows more slowly than the logarithmic function , reflecting a lower efficiency of the fragmentation process .",
    "therefore , even at very high initial kinetic energies , some small fragments still remain .",
    "for instance , at @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) , @xmath98 .",
    "the same logarithmic behaviour of @xmath71 was reported by thornton _",
    "_ @xcite and behera _ et al .",

    "is then spent on moving the fragments apart .",
    "if friction would be taken into account , the efficiency of the fragmentation process would be even lower .",
    "the model we propose is generic in the sense that it contains the essential physical features for investigating fragmentation phenomena .",
    "its simplicity rests on a basic cohesive interaction between circular particles in two dimensions .",
    "furthermore , molecular dynamics calculations allow us to determine the physical quantities involved and moreover , to study their evolution during the fragmentation process .    in this article ,",
    "we have investigated the damage inflicted on a disc of interacting particles as the disc fragments upon impact with a wall  the damage being defined as the percentage of broken bonds between particles .",
    "its propagation into the disc evidently depends on the energy deposited in the system , but the damage rate was found to be independent of the impact energy shortly after the collision .",
    "furthermore , the percentage of energy actually used to fragment the system decreases with the energy deposited in the system , reflecting the low efficiency of the fragmentation process at high impact energy .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the power law exponent @xmath43 of the fragment size distribution , the total number of fragments , and the damage share the same logarithmic behaviour as functions of the energy deposited in the system .",
    "damage can not be directly measured by experiments , but the logarithmic behaviour of @xmath43 is observed in the fragmentation of rocks @xcite and liquid droplets @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , these two very different systems exhibit the same fragmentation behaviour .",
    "this suggests that at high impact energies , the crack propagation and fragmentation phenomena may not be sensitive to the particular structure of the system . as an interesting consequence of this same logarithmic behaviour , the power law exponent and the total number of fragments are proportional to the damage .",
    "these simple relations , that we expect to be generic , may guide us to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of fragmentation phenomena ."
