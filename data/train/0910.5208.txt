    "the theory of open quantum systems deals with the systems that interact with their surrounding environments @xcite .",
    "such systems are of great interest , and these open quantum systems have been extensively studied since the origin of quantum theory @xcite . despite of the noticeable progresses in the theory , many fundamental difficulties still remain .",
    "one of the problem is decoherence ( or loss of coherence ) due to the interactions between system and environment .",
    "recently , it received intense considerations in quantum information and quantum computation , where decoherence is regarded as a bottleneck to the construction of quantum information processor @xcite .",
    "the persistence of quantum coherence is relied on in quantum computer , quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation . and",
    "it is also fundamental in understanding the quantum world for the interpretation that the emergence of the classical world from the quantum world can be seen as a decoherence process due to the interaction between system and environment .",
    "various methods have been proposed to reduce this unexpected effect , such as the quantum error - correction code @xcite , error - avoiding code @xcite , minimal decoherence model @xcite , bang - bang techniques @xcite , quantum zeno effect ( qze ) @xcite and decoherence - free subspaces ( dfs ) @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , all of these schemes can not suppress the unexpect effect successfully for accessorial conditions are needed .",
    "altafini @xcite pointed out that the irreversible decohering dynamics is uncontrollable under coherent control .",
    "optimal control technique , which has been successfully studied in chemical systems @xcite and classical systems @xcite , has been exploited to control the quantum decoherence @xcite , where an optimal control law was designed to effectively suppress decoherence effects in markovian open quantum systems , dynamic coupling in the spin - boson model , and time optimal control respectively . in this paper , we consider the optimal decoherence control problem in non - markovian quantum open system .",
    "markovian approximation is used under the assumption that the correlation time between the systems and environments is infinitely short @xcite . for neglecting the memory effect ,",
    "the lindblad master equation has been built .",
    "however , in some cases , such as quantum brownian motion(qbm ) @xcite and a two - level atom interacting with a thermal reservoir with lorentzian spectral density @xcite , an exactly analytic description of the open quantum system dynamic is needed . especially in high - speed communication the characteristic time scales become comparable with the reservoir correlation time , and in solid state devices memory effects are typically non negligible .",
    "so it is necessary to extensively study the non - markovian master equation .",
    "we briefly compare the non - markovian dynamics ( non - markovian master equation ) with markovian process ( markovian master equation ) in appendix a. for details one can refer to gardiner s book @xcite or / and breuer s @xcite .    in this paper",
    "the focus will be on the optimal decoherence control of non - markovian quantum system , particularly the simplest system possible , a two - level system governed by the time - convolutionless ( tcl ) equation .",
    "we determine control fields which minimize the cost functional suppressing the decoherence process by applying the pontryagin maximum principle ( pmp ) in ohmic reservoir with lorentz - drude regularization in the following three conditions : @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the characteristic frequency of the quantum system of interest and @xmath4 the cut - off frequency of ohmic reservoir .",
    "thus , @xmath5 implies that the spectrum of the reservoir does not completely overlap with the frequency of the system oscillator and @xmath2 implies the converse case . with this",
    "it is possible to engineer different types of artificial reservoir , and couple them to the system in a controlled way .",
    "we also compare our results with no - control system evolution and the optimal control of the open system with markovian approximation .",
    "the main result of the paper is that decoherence phenomenon can be successfully suppressed in the @xmath0 case .",
    "then this explores the coupling of the system to engineered reservoirs @xcite , in which the coupling and state of the environment are controllable .",
    "this may pave a newly way to the realization of the first basic elements of quantum computers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first introduce quantum decoherence and the quantum master equation for driven open quantum systems . in sec .",
    "iii we formulate the optimal control formalism and deduced pmp with a minimum cost functional .",
    "moreover , we consider the non - markovian two - level optimal control problem . in sec .",
    "iv , we numerically analyze the optimal control of decoherence to the two - level system , and analyze the difference between markovian optimal control and non - markovian optimal control from both the system time evolution and the power spectrum .",
    "conclusions and prospective views are given in sec.v .",
    "consider a quantum system @xmath6 embedded in a dissipative environment @xmath7 and interacting with a time - dependent classical external field , i.e. , the control field .",
    "the total hamiltonian has the general form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the hamiltonian of the system , @xmath10 the hamiltonian of the control field , and @xmath11 the bath and @xmath12 their interaction that is responsible for decoherence .",
    "the operators @xmath9 and @xmath11 act on @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the operator @xmath10 contains a time - dependent external field to adjust the quantum evolution of the system .",
    "one of the central goals of the theoretical treatment is then the analysis of the dynamical behavior of the populations and coherences , which are given by the elements of the reduced density matrix , defined as @xmath15 ,   \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the total density matrix for both the system and the environment , @xmath17 the partial trace taken over the environment .",
    "the driven model consists of a @xmath18-level system interacting with a thermal bath in the presence of external control field @xcite , and the hamiltonian is @xmath19 @xmath20 is the control hamiltonian adjusted by the control parameters @xmath21 , and @xmath21 represents the control field .",
    "the hamiltonian of the environment is assumed to be composed of harmonic oscillators with natural frequencies @xmath22 and masses @xmath23 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the coordinates and their conjugate momenta , and the planck constant @xmath26 is assigned to be @xmath27 .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian between the system @xmath6 and the environment @xmath7 is assumed to be bilinear @xcite , @xmath28    the interaction hamiltonian in the interaction picture therefore takes the form @xmath29 where @xmath30    the effect of the environment on the dynamics of the system can be seen as a interplay between the dissipation and fluctuation phenomena . and",
    "it is the general environment that makes the quantum system loss of coherence ( decoherence ) .",
    "in general the decoherence can be demonstrated as the interaction between the system and environment .",
    "then the reduced density matrix of the system can evolve into the form @xmath31 which describes a statistical mixture of noninterfering states .",
    "thus , a commonly proposed way to analyze decoherence is by examining how the nondiagonal elements of the reduced density matrix evolve under the master equation .    in the present work ,",
    "we shall concentrate on optimal control of the decoherence effect in open quantum system .",
    "the kinetic equation of strong coupling non - markovian quantum system is the following exact time - convolutionless ( tcl ) form of the master equation , @xmath32 with the time - local generator , called the tcl generator @xmath33^{-1}\\mathcal { p } ,     \\end{split}\\ ] ] and the inhomogeneity @xmath34^{-1}g(t , t_0)\\mathcal { q } ,     \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the superoperator @xmath36 for detail one see appendix a and/or @xcite    in order to facilitate the calculations , we will convert the differential equation ( 8) from the complex density matrix representation into the so - called coherent vector representation @xcite .",
    "firstly , we choose an orthonormal basis of @xmath37 matrices @xmath38 with respect to the inner product @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the n - dimensional identity matrix and @xmath41 are @xmath37 hermitian traceless matrices .",
    "in particular , the hermitian density matrix @xmath42 can be represented as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a real @xmath45 dimensional vector , called the coherent vector of @xmath42 .",
    "this is the well - known bloch vector representation of quantum systems .",
    "thus the master equation ( 8) can be rewritten as a differential equation of the coherent vector : @xmath46 with the initial condition , @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the adjoint representation matrices of @xmath49 respectively , and @xmath50 is the coherence vector of @xmath51 , and the term @xmath52 represents the decoherence process , @xmath53 is the number of control fields , @xmath54 adjusts the quantum evolution such that the coherence is conserved .",
    "as well known , the evolution of the state variable @xmath55 governed by the master equation ( [ syst ] ) depends not only on the initial state @xmath50 but also on the choice of the time - dependent control variable @xmath56 . some earlier works to these control problem are listed in the reference @xcite .",
    "especially , the exact result was considered of the quantum two - state dynamics driven by stationary non - markovian discrete noise in @xcite . in this section",
    ", we are going to suppress the unexpected effect of decoherence by optimal control technique that wants to force the system evolving along some prescribed cohering trajectories .",
