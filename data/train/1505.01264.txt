    "for several decades now , chains and arrays of low - capacitance josephson junctions have attracted much attention as systems in which quantum phase transitions can be studied@xcite , and as many - body platforms that could enable novel quantum phases@xcite and topologically protected states@xcite .",
    "however , there have been many more theoretical proposals along these lines than experimental works , and experiments have mostly been confined to several intriguing avenues of research concerning the superconductor - insulator transition@xcite , the dynamics of quantum - phase slips@xcite , metrological current standards@xcite , conjectured solitonic phenomena@xcite , and the use of josephson - junction chains as superinductors.@xcite    the insulating state of superconducting junction arrays is located below a superconductor - insulator ( si ) quantum phase transition , and is synonymous with the destruction of superconducting phase coherence across the array , and localization of cooper pairs .",
    "the cooper - pair insulator occurs when the characteristic cooper - pair charging energy significantly exceeds the josephson coupling energy , @xmath3 .",
    "the understanding and engineering of charge transport deep in the insulating state presents difficult problems due to the competition between various modes of transport which include both cooper - pair and single - electron tunneling processes@xcite , both of which occur in the presence of significant disorder .",
    "nearly all studies of charge transport in insulating arrays , however , start from a point of view where it is assumed that the low energy excitations that play a role in conduction are cooper pairs .",
    "this is based on the assumption that the temperature is sufficiently low to ignore the presence of unpaired electrons .",
    "a recent calculation of the dc conductivity for arrays deep in the insulating state , based upon single cooper - pair excitations and including weak disorder , was put forth by syzranov _",
    "et al_.@xcite .",
    "their model proposes cooper pairs as the sole charge carriers , and describes transport in terms of variable range hopping between adjacent islands as a result of josephson tunneling . in another theoretical study by fistul _ _ et al.__@xcite , a model for cooper - pair transport in the insulating state of 1 and 2 d arrays of josephson junctions is applied to the interpretation of experimental data from granular superconducting films .",
    "similar lines of thinking have been taken in the analysis of josephson - junction array experiments , also based on the assumption that charge transport far below the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath2 , is predominantly carried by cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "it is important to realize that in most experiments , the contribution of quasiparticles can not be ignored .",
    "this contribution has proven important in studies of qubits @xcite and cooper - pair transistors@xcite , but has only recently been studied theoretically in jj chains @xcite    we have made a systematic investigation of charge transport for temperatures ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath5 in 1d josephson arrays that are characterized by large charging energies and high junction resistances . in this regime",
    "the arrays are deep in the insulating state .",
    "we find that cooper - pair transport is completely suppressed and charge transport proceeds via single - electron injection into the cooper - pair insulator .",
    "furthermore , we observe a strong parity effect@xcite , with a well - defined cross - over temperature @xmath6 , at which the voltage injection threshold decreases sharply .",
    "the parity effect has been studied previously in superconducting single - electron transistors,@xcite and in cooper - pair boxes,@xcite where it appears as a temperature crossover from 2e to 1e periodicity in normalized gate charge .",
    "in contrast , our array measurements show the parity effect has a global effect on charge transport through the whole array .",
    "the presence of @xmath71 thermally - excited bcs quasiparticle per island in the array significantly enhances the tunneling rates of single electrons through the chain , and simultaneously destroys the insulating state of the array , as the voltage threshold for single - electron injection is suppressed to zero .",
    "we have fabricated 1d chains of al - alo@xmath8-al josephson junctions having a length of @xmath9=50 junctions using electron beam lithography , followed by thermal shadow - evaporation and _ in - situ _ oxidation of @xmath10 films , which have a thickness of 30 nm .",
    "we have focused on three arrays with slightly different properties , having in common large junction resistances , @xmath11 and large cooper - pair charging energies , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the junction capacitance , as described in table 1 .",
    "the arrays exhibit a coulomb blockade at low temperatures , both in the superconducting state as well as in the normal state , which is obtained by suppressing the superconducting gap in the films using an external parallel magnetic field .",

    "the lines were additionally filtered using chip lc components on the circuit board , and at room temperature using low - pass lc filters .",
    "several measurements of superconducting single - electron transistors were made using this setup that clearly showed @xmath25-periodic stability diagrams , indicating negligible quasi - particle poisoning due to the presence of non - equilibrium quasiparticles in the measurement leads .",
    "we have characterized the devices using current - voltage measurements with voltage biases ranging from 5@xmath22v to over 50@xmath26v , and with a dc current resolution as low as @xmath70.8 femtoampere for currents up to several nanoamperes .",
    "in addition , we have used a parallel magnetic field @xmath27 to continuously suppress the superconducting gap @xmath28 . from our measurements",
    "we have found that the gap depends on the parallel magnetic field through @xmath29 , as expected@xcite , with @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "it is important to distinguish between large - scale current - voltage characteristics ( or @xmath32s ) and small - scale @xmath32s . in the presence of a superconducting gap , ` large - scale '",

    "this occurs for @xmath33 . `",

    "+    @xmath32 and differential conductance @xmath38 data are shown for the three devices of table 1 in figure 2 . the asymptotic normal state conductance at large bias voltage @xmath34 determines the chain average of the normal state tunnel resistance @xmath16 per junction . from this",
    ", one can extract the average josephson coupling energy using the abegaokar - baratoff relation @xmath39 .",
    "the cooper - pair charging energy @xmath40 for each device is found experimentally by extrapolating its normal state @xmath32 data from the linear regime at large voltage bias to find the zero - current intercept @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath32 s in the superconducting state in zero magnetic field show a steep onset of direct quasiparticle tunneling occurring at @xmath42 , allowing one to directly estimate @xmath43 . from the measurements in figure 2",
    ", all devices are found to have nearly the same superconducting gap , @xmath44ev .",
    "devices a and b show a large ` bcs peak ' that develops at @xmath45 .",
    "this peak arises from the overlap of divergent bcs quasiparticle density of states ( dos ) of the superconducting islands of the chain .",
    "the peak is broadened primarily by offset charges that randomly shift the chemical potential of individual islands relative to their nearest neighbors .",
    "the result is a misalignment of the divergent bcs island dos s across the chain , which in the absence of charge disorder would be aligned when the voltage bias across individual junctions equals @xmath46",
    ". the broadening and concomitant reduction of this bcs peak therefore gives a measure of the relative disorder of the chains due to offset charges and fabrication inhomogeneity .",
    "as clearly seen in figure 2 , the bcs peak for device c is significantly more broadened as compared to devices a and b. in addition , there appears to be a random structure in the @xmath32 data for this device around the onset for direct quasiparticle tunneling .",
    "this is expected as device c has a significantly larger @xmath17 compared to device a and b , which makes it much more sensitive to random offset charges . in addition , device c was fabricated in a separate processing run , using different lithographic development parameters , and therefore may have more intrinsic disorder due to reduced film and junction quality .    small - scale @xmath32 data for device b is shown in the inset of figure 2 .",
    "note that the current scale in the inset of figure 2 is 5 orders of magnitude lower than in the main plot .",
    "there is a clear voltage threshold @xmath47 for the onset of femtoampere currents .",
    "threshold voltages can be distinquished quite clearly in the differential conductance at lower temperatures , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "the region @xmath48 shows a current blockade and a zero - bias conductance @xmath49 that is identically zero , or at most , lower than our measurement resolution , @xmath50 .",
    "we experimentaly determine the voltage threshold @xmath51 as the absolute value of the voltage bias at which the conductance rises above @xmath52 ( see lower plot in figure 3 ) , which is a factor of 10 greater than the measurement resolution .",
    "as seen in figure 4 , there is a characteristic temperature @xmath1 at which @xmath51 drops sharply to zero , and above which a measurable zero - bias conductance is observed .",
    "a subset of the temperature dependent @xmath32 data for device b is shown in the lower plot of figure 3 for @xmath53 and temperatures 25 , 300 , 350 , 400 and 450mk .",
    "@xmath1 for device b in zero field is found to be 270mk ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "the data at 300mk and above show a conductance peak around @xmath54 that grows with temperature , but starts out with a small mini - gap that appears to be a remnant of the blockade region below @xmath1 .",
    "the conductance peak arises from the overlap of the bcs dos from island to island across the chain , and only becomes evident when there are thermally excited quasiparticles occupying these states .",
    "( for a large josephson junction such thermally excited quasiparticles give rise to a logarithmic singularity at @xmath54 in the @xmath32 at finite t).@xcite     +     +",
    "the dependence of the measured threshold voltage @xmath51 on temperature for device a is shown in the upper plot of figure 4 for several values of the parallel magnetic field , @xmath27= 0 , 0.25 , 0.35 and 0.45 t. it is evident that @xmath51 vanishes sharply at a specific temperature that depends on @xmath27 .",
    "we argue that this behavior is a consequence of the parity effect for small superconducting islands . the ground state free energy for an odd number of electrons is higher than that for even numbers by the amount @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the effective number of states at finite @xmath57 arising from integration over the bcs quasiparticle dos , @xmath58 is the volume of the island and @xmath59 is the density of states for the normal metal at the fermi energy@xcite .",
    "the free - energy difference @xmath60 for a single island vanishes at a cross - over temperature @xmath61 . using the island volumes given in table i , the experimentally determined @xmath43 , and taking @xmath62 m@xmath63 j@xmath64 , for the density of states for aluminum",
    ", one can compute the theoretically expected parity temperature for isolated islands . for islands such as those in devices a and b , we calculate @xmath1=260mk , and for the islands of device c , @xmath1=277mk .",
    "one notices that for our device parameters , @xmath65 , which is much less than @xmath661.3k for aluminum .",
    "we experimentally determine the array parity temperature @xmath1 as the temperature at which @xmath51 passes through the voltage threshold observed in the normal state at the lowest temperature , which is indicated in figure 4 ( upper plot ) by the horizontal dotted line . for @xmath53",
    "we find @xmath1=256 , 269 and 294mk , respectively , for devices a , b and c. the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath67 is shown in figure 4 for the three devices , and is observed to be linear with @xmath67 , hence linear with @xmath28 as expected . given that @xmath28 is found to be nearly the same for all devices , the results imply a different @xmath68 for each device .",
    "this result can only partially be understood within the single - island picture of the parity effect .",
    "the island volume for device c is nearly twice that for devices a and b , ( see table 1 ) .",
    "island volume affects @xmath1 logarithmically , and therefore would only lead to a variation in @xmath1 of 17mk .",
    "however , the observed difference in @xmath1 between device b and c is 25mk , and between devices a and c , 38mk .",
    "devices a and b , fabricated in the same evaporation and located in the same ebl field , show a difference in @xmath1 of 13mk , even though they have nominally the same island volume .",
    "the data suggest that the inferred @xmath68 for our devices does not follow from single - island considerations alone , but could be explained if the effective bcs quasiparticle dos for the system of coupled islands is modified due to charge transport processes .",
    "one could expect @xmath68 to depend on factors such as the charging energy , tunnel resistance , and offset charge and other disorder in the array . as can be seen in the large - scale @xmath32 data of figure 2 ( discussed above ) , device",
    "a with the lowest @xmath1 also exhibits the largest bcs peak in the tunneling dos , followed by device b , which has the second lowest @xmath1 .",
    "although the parity effect in superconducting single - electron transistors has been well known for the last two decades , it has been almost entirely neglected in studies of josephson - junction arrays . a sole theoretical paper by feigelman _ _ et al.__@xcite pointed out the implications of the parity effect on the experimental search for the charge - unbinding transition in 2d junction arrays .",
    "discussions of the parity effect in experimental works on both 2d junction arrays and 2d disordered superconducting films , however , are conspicuously absent .",
    "our results are particularly relevant for the latter , as the theoretical models describing disordered superconducting films below the superconductor - insulator transition are based on a junction - array picture for the mesoscopically - structured films@xcite .    in voltage - biased single - electron transistors , where there is no threshold for conduction ,",
    "the parity effect is observed by change in the periodicy of the gate - dependent current at finite bias@xcite . in a cooper - pair box",
    ", the parity effect can be seen directly by measuring the box charge and observing a transition from @xmath69 to @xmath25 periodic coulomb staircases@xcite . in the array measurements presented here",
    ", however , the parity effect has a global effect on charge transport across the whole chain of junctions . for a single island",
    ", the parity - dependent free energy difference goes to zero precisely as the thermal expectation for the number of bcs quasiparticles @xmath70 no longer depends on the charge parity of the island@xcite . in our junction chains",
    ", it appears that the presence of @xmath71 thermally - excited bcs quasiparticle per island effectively destroys the insulating state , by sharply removing the voltage threshold for single - electron injection .",
    "in addition , the tunneling rates for single electrons through the chain are significantly enhanced due to the presence of quasiparticles . the precise microscopic mechanism underlying this phenomena",
    "is currently being investigated .",
    "some simulation results on parity effects in arrays can be found in cole _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite .",
    "recent experimental results on a hybrid normal - superconducting transistor illustrate enhanced charge tunneling due to a non - equilibrium quasiparticle distribution.@xcite",
    "+    the zero - bias conductance @xmath71 was measured under applied parallel magnetic fields for temperatures ranging from the parity temperature up to 1k .",
    "@xmath72 in all devices is found to follow an arrhenius law for thermal activation , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the activation energy , as shown in the upper plot of figure 5 .",
    "the zero - bias conductance in the normal state at 0.6 t ( not shown ) continues to decrease above @xmath75=10 , indicating an electronic temperature lower than 100 mk@xcite .    as a function of applied @xmath76-field , the activation energy for devices a and b is linear with @xmath67 , as shown in figure 5 , and appears to be equal to @xmath28 .",
    "the data can be accurately fit to @xmath77 , with @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "we find that the experimentally determined value of @xmath74 in zero applied field agrees with an independent estimate of @xmath43 gained from the large scale @xmath32 data , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the voltage that marks the onset of direct quasiparticle tunneling that occurring for @xmath82 .",
    "an activation energy that equals the superconducting gap can be easily understood because an energy of @xmath83 is required to break a cooper - pair .",
    "since two independent excitations are created , the exponent for thermal activation is @xmath84 rather than @xmath83.@xcite    for device c , @xmath74 varies randomly and somewhat irreproducibly with @xmath27 , taking values between 250 and 350 @xmath85v .",
    "we attribute this to significantly larger disorder present in device c , as inferred from the large scale iv data , and which is also consistent with the much larger @xmath17 for device c. in contrast to this , however , the activation exponent for the conductance evaluated at @xmath86mv for device c shows nearly identical behavior to that of @xmath72 for devices a and b. this voltage bias is just outside the observed coulomb blockade region of device c in the normal state , which is also relevant for unpaired charge carriers when the islands of the chain are superconducting .",
    "we conclude that transport above the parity temperature is set by thermally - activated quasiparticles in chains where strong charge disorder does not dominate .",
    "thermally - activated transport in 1d squid - arrays was reported recently by zimmer _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite .",
    "the use of a squid geometry permitted tuning @xmath87 _ in situ _ using a perpendicular magnetic field . to account for their measurements , zimmer _",
    "assume a zero - bias conductance that is the sum of two contributions : a flux - dependent part , as would be expected for cooper - pair tunneling , and a flux - independent term that remains when @xmath87 ( cooper - pair tunneling ) becomes very small .",
    "with @xmath87 suppressed to nearly zero , zimmer _",
    "observe an activation exponent of the order of the superconducting gap .",
    "these authors interpret their measured @xmath74 as a characteristic charging energy for localized cooper pairs undergoing variable - range hopping , although they mention as an alternative explanation , thermally generated quasiparticles .    as far as we are aware , zimmer _",
    "is the only reported measurement of thermally - activated zero - bias conduction in 1d arrays in the superconducting state .",
    "thermally - activated zero - bias conductance in 2d junction arrays has been reported by two groups some time ago@xcite .",
    "these authors interpreted their results in terms of a so - called `` core energy '' , @xmath88 , which is the energy required to create an electron - hole pair on adjoining sites ( _ e.g. _ by moving a single electron by one site ) , together with the induced polarization charge on neighboring islands .",
    "this model is known as the soliton model . in the superconducting state ,",
    "one finds for a 2d system , @xmath89 , where the first term come from breaking a cooper pair , and the second is the electrostatic energy for placing a single electron and hole on adjoining sites .",
    "since two independent excitations are created , @xmath90 .",
    "while tighe _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite found quantitative agreement with the core - energy model of localized dipoles , more detailed measurements by delsing _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite showed substantial deviations from this picture . for large @xmath91 , delsing _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite interpreted their results as evidence for cooper - pair / hole solitons , even though their measured activation energies showed a strong dependence on superconducting gap . delsing _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite also report thermally - activated conduction in a 1d chain , but only in the normal state .",
    "for a 1d chain with localized dipole excitations , one expects @xmath92 using the soliton model of tighe _ et al . _ and delsing _ _ et al.__@xcite , and therefore @xmath93 .",
    "our results for 1d chains show that @xmath74 agrees more closely with @xmath84 , with no additional term needed to account for the charging energy of electron - hole pairs on adjacent islands .",
    "the localized dipole model ignores tunneling processes that effectively lower the core energy .",
    "as noted previously , above @xmath1 , a voltage threshold for conduction is no longer found . in summary ,",
    "conductance above @xmath1 is consistent with the lack of an electrostatic threshold for both charge injection and activated transport .",
    "the conductance at @xmath34=4mv , @xmath94 , is plotted against the experimentally determined @xmath95 .",
    "the dot - dashed line is a fit to the expression @xmath96 which yields @xmath97mk.,title=\"fig:\",width=316 ] [ fig : injection ]",
    "finally , we have measured conductance at 20 mk and above the threshold voltage @xmath51 as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "data for device a is shown in figure 6 taken at a bias voltage , @xmath34=4mv .",
    "here we have used the fit from figure 5 to express @xmath27 in terms of @xmath84 . as the superconducting gap is suppressed by the magnetic field , the conduction @xmath94 , in what we will call",
    "the `` injection regime '' , is clearly exponentially enhanced by the factor @xmath98 .",
    "in contrast to the zero - bias conductance , we find the effective temperature @xmath97mk , which is considerably larger than the zero - field parity temperature for this device , @xmath99mk .",
    "this shows that charge transport below @xmath1 and above the voltage threshold occurs by injection of single electrons / holes into a non - equilibrium steady state , which shows a significantly elevated effective temperature .",
    "future experiments are needed to address the detailed nature of this steady state and it s relation to the voltage threshold for conduction , @xmath51 , observed at low temperatures .",
    "in conclusion , we find that for 1d josephson - junction chains deep in the insulating regime , where @xmath100 , there is a characteristic parity temperature @xmath1 , above which the insulating state is destroyed by thermally - excited bcs quasiparticles . above @xmath1 ,",
    "an observable zero - bias conductance appears and is thermally - activated with an activation energy equal to the superconducting gap .",
    "this can be understood most simply if charge carriers are single electrons and holes rather than cooper pairs .",
    "the situation is somewhat analogous to donor ionization in a doped semiconductor , although here the donors are the background of localized cooper pairs , and the effective ionization energy is strongly renormalized due to the singular bcs density of states .",
    "conduction at temperatures below @xmath1 occurring above the threshold voltage appears to be thermally - activated , with an exponent equal to the ratio of the superconducting gap to an effective thermal energy , @xmath101 .",
    "the effective temperature @xmath102 is found to be significantly higher than the electronic temperature that would otherwise exist in the array .",
    "this indicates that a non - equilibrium steady state of unpaired charge carriers becomes established , enabling above - threshold charge transport below the parity temperature in the cooper - pair insulator .",
