    "in recent years , considerable effort has been devoted to designing strategies able to counteract the undesired effects of the coupling with an external environment .",
    "notable examples are quantum error correction codes @xcite and error avoiding codes @xcite , both based on encoding the state to be protected into carefully selected subspaces of the joint hilbert space of the system and a number of ancillary systems .",
    "the main limitation for the efficient implementation of these encoding strategies for combating decoherence is the large amount of extra resources required @xcite .",
    "correcting all possible one - qubit errors requires at least five qubits @xcite .",
    "this number rapidly increases if fault tolerant error correction is also considered .",
    "for this reason , other alternative approaches which do not require ancillary resources have been pursued and developed in parallel with encoding strategies .",
    "these decoherence control schemes may be divided into two main categories : open - loop @xcite , and closed - loop ( or quantum feedback ) strategies @xcite .    in open loop techniques (",
    "also called dynamical decoupling schemes ) , the system is subject to an external , suitably tailored , time - dependent driving .",
    "the external control hamiltonian is chosen on the basis of a limited , _ a priori _ , knowledge of the system - environment dynamics , in order to realize an effective dynamical decoupling of the system from the environment .",
    "the main idea behind these open loop schemes originates in refocusing techniques in nmr spectroscopy @xcite , but they have been recently transposed in many different contexts , such as the inhibition of the decay of an unstable atomic state @xcite , the suppression of magnetic state decoherence @xcite and the reduction of heating effects in linear ion traps @xcite .",
    "the main drawback of open loop decoupling procedures is that the timing constraints are particularly stringent .",
    "in fact , the decoupling interaction has to be turned on and off at extremely short time scales , even faster than typical environmental timescale @xcite .",
    "an approach to quantum state protection related to decoupling schemes is represented by reservoir engineering schemes @xcite , in which an external driving is used to create an effective reservoir for the system . in such a way , the state to be protected becomes a stationary state of the modified dynamics .",
    "examples have been proposed for the center - of - mass motion of trapped ions @xcite and for atomic internal states @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to notice that quantum error correction codes , error avoiding codes and decoupling schemes can be described in a unified framework based on the representations of the algebra of errors ( the algebra generated by the set of system operators describing the effects of the environment ) @xcite . in the error - algebra framework , quantum information is protected using symmetry . in the case of decoherence - free subspaces",
    "the symmetry naturally exists in the interaction with the environment . in the case of decoupling techniques ,",
    "symmetry is induced by the added driving hamiltonian .",
    "finally , in quantum error correction codes , symmetry exists implicitly within the larger hilbert space of the system and ancillae @xcite .",
    "closed loop techniques represented the first attempt to control decoherence @xcite . in this case , the system to be protected is subject to appropriate measurements , and the classical information obtained from this measurement is used for real - time correction of the system dynamics .",
    "this technique shares therefore some similarities with quantum error correction , which also checks which error has taken place and eventually corrects it .",
    "however , the main limiting aspect of feedback schemes is the need of a measurement , which is always inevitably prone to errors and finite detection efficiency .",
    "for this reason , recent attempts have tried to improve these closed - loop schemes by avoiding the explicit measurement step , resorting to what may be called `` fully quantum feedback '' schemes , in which sensors , controller , and actuators are themselves quantum systems and interact coherently with the system to be controlled @xcite . in this case , the entire feedback loop is coherent and is not limited by measurement inefficiencies .",
    "in fact , some of us have already proposed a scheme of this kind @xcite .",
    "it improved an existing closed - loop scheme for decoherence control @xcite , by replacing the measurement step ( an atomic detection ) with the coherent interaction with a quantum controller , represented by a high - q cavity .",
    "the quantum coherent interaction allows an automatic correction of the dynamics , without needing an explicit measurement , similar to what happens in quantum error correction codes .",
    "in this paper we proceed further along this direction by introducing a significant simplification of the `` automatic '' scheme of @xcite . as in @xcite",
    ", the present scheme is designed to protect an arbitrary quantum state of a microwave cavity mode with a given parity against the decohering effects of photon loss . however , in the present proposal , the whole feedback loop is realized by a single atom crossing the cavity .",
    "it `` measures '' the parity of the field in the first part of its interaction with the cavity .",
    "the atom then performs , when needed , the state correction in the second part of the interaction time . for this reason ,",
    "this scheme is another example of a fully quantum feedback loop @xcite , which employs very limited resources , namely a single atom playing the roles of sensor , controller and actuator . in the scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite instead , a first atom is the sensor , a second high-@xmath0 cavity is the controller .",
    "a second atom is used as the actuator .",
    "the proposed strategy shares also some analogies with quantum error correction codes .",
    "the error to be corrected is the loss of one photon , which drives the state out of a parity eigenspace . with this respect , the two - level atom implementing the scheme plays the role of the error syndrome , because its state denotes the eventual presence of an error , that is , of a wrong parity .",
    "the simplifications brought by the present scheme are relevant since they make the present proposal much easier to implement than that of @xcite , because it does not need a second high-@xmath0 cavity and the use of a second atomic source .",
    "an easy implementation is an important asset . in spite of very many theoretical proposals for decoherence control ,",
    "there has been only very few experimental demonstrations .",
    "a simple example of decoherence - free subspace immune from magnetic field noise has been demonstrated with two trapped ions in @xcite , while error correction codes for single qubit errors has been demonstrated only in nmr quantum information processors @xcite .",
    "outside the usual application in nmr refocusing techniques , dynamical decoupling schemes have been implemented only in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a proof - of - principle demonstration for a photon polarization qubit with artificially added decoherence has been realized ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent demonstration of _ encoded _ decoupling schemes in nmr systems ) .",
    "a simple demonstration of fully quantum feedback has been given in the case of a three - nuclear spin system in @xcite , but no closed - loop decoherence control scheme has been demonstrated yet . the eventual implementation of the present proposal is important also because it would represent the first demonstration of the control of an intrinsic and unavoidable decoherence source , photon loss , instead of the control of an added noise .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , the cavity qed model under study is described , and the quantum state protection scheme is presented in detail . in section iii , the performance of the proposed scheme is studied by solving numerically the dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "different examples of initial quantum states of the radiation mode to protect will be considered .",
    "section iv is for concluding remarks .",
    "the general purpose of decoherence control schemes is to protect a given subspace of a system hilbert space , and quantum coherent evolutions within it .",
    "the conditions under which these noiseless subsystems exist , and universal quantum computation within them is possible have been already illustrated in the recent literature , especially in the case of qubits @xcite .",
    "however , the experimental realization of these general schemes is difficult in many physical situations .",
    "this is particularly true in infinite dimensional systems as radiation modes , which are of fundamental importance for any quantum communication scheme and for which only few specific ( and difficult to implement ) quantum error correction schemes have been proposed @xcite .",
    "here , we shall focus on the case of a radiation mode confined in a cavity . the first examples of quantum gates and quantum state manipulations have been demonstrated in this context @xcite .",
    "moreover , cavity modes could represent the nodes of a quantum network of multiple atom - cavity systems linked by optical interconnects @xcite .    in electromagnetic cavities ,",
    "decoherence is mainly of dissipative origin and it is associated with the photon losses due to diffraction and to the transmission and absorption of the mirrors . in the general case where the reservoir of the continuum of electromagnetic modes is at thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath1 , the dynamics is well described by the master equation ( in the frame rotating at the mode frequency @xmath2 ) @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the field density matrix and @xmath5 the annihilation operator of the cavity mode , @xmath6 the cavity decay rate and @xmath7^{-1}$ ] is the equilibrium thermal photon number .",
    "the cavity mode is affected by two kinds of errors , photon loss ( with rate @xmath8 ) and thermal photon creation ( with rate @xmath9 ) . however , in many cases , one has @xmath10 .",
    "photon loss is then by far the predominant source of decoherence .    in @xcite ,",
    "a closed - loop scheme for protecting a generic state of a cavity mode has been proposed , based on the simple idea of giving back the photon as soon as it is lost . in the case where the sensor is represented by a single - photon photodetector with quantum efficiency @xmath11 continuously monitoring the cavity , the dynamics in the presence of feedback is described by the master equation ( in the case @xmath12 ) @xcite @xmath13\\right ] \\;.",
    "\\label{meqfeed}\\ ] ] in the case of perfect detection ( @xmath14 ) cavity damping is therefore replaced by an unconventional phase - diffusion process . in the ideal case ,",
    "the only well - preserved states are the fock states . however , since the phase diffusion process is very slow , the resulting quantum state protection is still significant for other states @xcite .    in the case of microwave cavities , there are no efficient single photon detectors besides atoms crossing the cavity mode . the photon counting can be replaced in this case by a field parity measurement@xcite .",
    "this measurement can be efficiently performed by using a dispersive atom - field interaction revealed by a ramsey interferometry set - up @xcite .",
    "if these parity measurements are repeated at short time intervals , so that multiple photon losses between them are negligible , they reveal unambiguously the photon losses and replace a single - photon photodetector .",
    "this is precisely the stroboscopic measurement scheme proposed in @xcite for the cavity qed microwave experiments described in details in @xcite .",
    "the price to pay when using parity measurements instead of photon counting is that only states with a given parity can be protected .    ref .",
    "@xcite improved this closed - loop decoherence control scheme by transforming it into one of the first examples of `` fully quantum feedback loop '' . in @xcite ,",
    "the feedback loop involved a first atom probing the parity of the cavity mode .",
    "the final state of the first atom , correlated to the field parity , was measured by a state - selective atomic detector .",
    "depending upon the result of this measurement , a dedicated electronics could send a second atom through the cavity .",
    "this atom would emit a photon in the mode , correcting the effect of photon loss and restoring the initial field parity .",
    "therefore , in this case , both the sensor ( first atom + detector ) and the controller ( the electronics ) are essentially classical , while only the actuator ( the second atom ) is a quantum system . in @xcite the detector and the controlling electronics are replaced by a second high-@xmath0 microwave cavity , resonantly interacting with the two atoms .",
    "this cavity becomes the controller and the feedback loop has become completely quantum .",
    "here , we propose a further improvement of this protection scheme , making its experimental implementation easier .",
    "the present scheme is based again on the measurement of the cavity mode parity , but it involves only one atom , which , in passing through the cavity , first measures and then corrects the state of the mode when needed .",
    "the simplification of the design is evident , with a single atom realizing the whole loop , by playing all the roles of sensor , controller and actuator .",
    "the microwave cavity qed set - up which we have specifically considered for the implementation of the proposed decoherence control scheme is described in detail in @xcite , in which either generation of non - classical states of the radiation @xcite , and coherent quantum state manipulation @xcite have been already demonstrated .",
    "a sketch of the set - up is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "its central part is a superconducting cavity @xmath15 in a fabry - perot configuration , cooled down at about @xmath16 k. it sustains two gaussian field modes with the same spatial structure and orthogonal linear polarizations .",
    "they are separated by a frequency interval @xmath17 khz around @xmath18 ghz .",

    "the atoms then interact with the cavity , quasi resonant on the @xmath25 transition .",

    "the whole protection process is realized by the atom during its transit through the cavity mode .",
    "the first part of the interaction time is used for the `` measurement '' of the cavity mode parity , while the second part is used for the possible state correction .",
    "a long interaction time is therefore needed , requiring atoms with a moderate velocity .",
    "we are considering here velocities around @xmath34 m / s , which are straightforwardly obtained in the experiments without need of atomic beam cooling @xcite .",
    "the feedback atoms , sent one by one , are initially prepared in the excited state @xmath35 .",
    "the feedback atoms are finally detected in the field ionization detector d. in a single experimental sequence , we might thus access the individual quantum trajectory of the cavity field , conditioned to the atomic detections . we are , however , interested here in an unconditional decoherence control scheme , able to preserve any quantum state with a given parity . for this reason ,",
    "we assume that the information about the individual atomic state is finally discarded in the data analysis , and we thus consider only quantum averages of very many individual trajectories .",
    "note that keeping the atomic state information and accessing to individual trajectories leads to a different , conditional , protection scheme which will be discussed elsewhere .",

    "the atom corrects the cavity state component with the wrong parity , by transferring its excitation to it . as in @xcite ,",
    "this is done using adiabatic transfer . when the atomic detuning is adiabatically changed from a large positive to a large negative value ,",
    "the system remains in the instantaneous dressed state ( see @xcite ) , realizing therefore the transformation @xmath63 the photon emission is thus independent of the cavity mode state , an essential feature for state - independent protection .",
    "if the atom is in state @xmath39 , corresponding to a field measured to be in the  right \" parity state , the opposite adiabatic transfer @xmath64 could take place , resulting in a spoiled parity .",

    "this prevents this unwanted transfer to occur .",
    "the ideal adiabatic transfer can be formally described by the operator @xmath68 so that the state of the atom - cavity mode system at the end of the atomic passage is @xmath69   \\rho \\left [ p_{even } \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{aa^{\\dagger } } } a    \\langle g|+   p_{odd } \\langle i|\\right ] .",

    "the two possibilities could be distinguished by detecting the exiting atoms respectively in @xmath66 or in @xmath39 , selecting in this way one of the quantum trajectories of the cavity mode conditional state .",
    "however , a fully quantum feedback has not to rely on the classical information provided by the atomic state detection , and it is necessarily unconditional .",
    "therefore , we discard the information about the individual atomic state , and tracing over the atom , we get that a generic feedback cycle , i.e. , a complete atomic passage , can be described by the following map for the cavity mode state @xmath4 @xmath70 these are the unitary manipulations characterizing the feedback scheme .",
    "however , in practice , these manipulations act simultaneously with the decohering effect of the thermal environment described by the master equation ( [ meq ] ) , and which are responsible for the `` errors '' ( single photon losses ) that the scheme is designed to correct for .",
    "the resulting evolution is no more unitary and described by the simple map of eq .",

    "each feedback cycle lasts exactly the time the atom takes to cross the cavity region of length @xmath77 mm around the cavity axis ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "every cycle immediately follows the preceding one , starting with the atom entering the interaction region just when the preceding one has left it .",
    "the feedback atom is always initially prepared in state @xmath22 so that , at the beginning of each cycle , the state of the whole system is @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the reduced state of the two modes at the end of the preceding cycle .",
    "the master equation has been solved in a truncated fock basis for both modes , using the parameter values of the experimental apparatus described in @xcite ( see the preceding section ) .",
    "we have also assumed that both cavity modes are coupled to a thermal reservoir with mean photon number @xmath82 .",
    "this means that thermal excitation from the reservoir is not negligible .",
    "one might thus expect that the proposed state protection scheme , designed to correct for photon losses only , may not work properly in this case .",
    "we shall see that this is not the case because photon loss is still more than twice more probable than thermal excitation .",
    "this is enough for our feedback scheme to achieve a significant state protection .",
    "as it has been already discussed in @xcite , a crucial parameter is the ratio between the time duration of the feedback cycle ( coinciding with the interaction time of the atom ) and the relaxation time of the cavity mode @xmath83 .",
    "it is evident that this ratio has to be as small as possible .",
    "fast atoms would be preferred .",
    "however , the feedback cycle is optimal at moderate velocities , since all the atomic manipulations have to fit within the cavity crossing time .",
    "note that the dispersive step of the parity measurement critically depends on the interaction time . in order to fulfill the @xmath44 phase shift condition ( @xmath84 ) , the faster the atom , the smaller the detuning @xmath85 .",

    "our scheme is not fault - tolerant , i.e. , it does not work perfectly in the presence of losses .",
    "not only the projections onto the parity eigenspaces , but also the adiabatic transfer in the correction stage is not perfect under realistic conditions . its efficiency when @xmath105 ms is about @xmath107 , and it is due not only to photon losses , but also to the fact that the initial positive value of the detuning can not be taken as large as required , because the atom would come close to resonance with the high frequency mode and transfer its excitation to it rather than to the mode to be protected .",
    ", width=336 ]    the most recent experiments with the cavity qed apparatus described in @xcite have been performed with a microwave mode with a relaxation time @xmath105 ms .",
    "we have however considered also longer relaxation times because there are realistic prospects to achieve somewhat longer cavity damping times soon .",
    "we have also investigated the performance of the scheme in the case of higher atomic velocities .",
    "protection of the odd cat state remains essentially unchanged up to @xmath108 m / s , and clearly worsens for velocities larger than @xmath109 m / s .",
    "for such velocities the dispersive @xmath44 phase shift can be no more realized in a satisfactory way .",
    "the scheme is suitable to protect any quantum coherent superposition with a given parity , and not only cat states .",
    "we have in fact also considered the case of an initially generated superposition of two fock states , @xmath110 .",
    "the time evolution of the reduced cavity mode density matrix in the fock basis , in the presence of the protection scheme , is compared with that with no protection in fig .  5 , considering , as in fig .  3 , @xmath97 ms and @xmath96 m / s .",
    "the other parameter values of the scheme are the same as those used in the cat state case of fig .",
    "we have considered also in this case the protection of an initial state effectively generated within the apparatus by the first atom .",
    "the generation of the superposition state @xmath110 can be achieved in the following way .",
    "initially the atom is injected in state @xmath35 with the cavity mode in the vacuum state ( the thermal cavity field can be erased by sending through it a train of absorbing atoms @xcite ) .",
    "then , a `` photon pump '' mechanism @xcite can be used to transfer photons into the cavity mode .",
    "the atomic excitation is first transferred to the mode via a resonant atom - cavity interaction .",
    "the atom is then reset to the excited state ( leaving the cavity undisturbed ) by simultaneously stark - shifting the atomic levels well out of resonance from the cavity mode , and applying a @xmath44 pulse on the transition @xmath111 . by repeating this sequence",
    ", one can generate an arbitary fock state @xmath112 . in the specific case of the state @xmath113 ,",
    "the generation sequence is : i ) resonant @xmath44 pulse yielding @xmath114 ; iii ) classical @xmath37 pulse on the @xmath115 transition yielding @xmath116 ; iv ) resonant interaction with the cavity , realizing the @xmath44 pulse @xmath117 while leaving the @xmath118 component untouched ; v ) stark - shift and classical @xmath44 pulse giving @xmath119 ; vi ) resonant interaction with the cavity mode giving @xmath120 ; vii ) classical @xmath37 pulse on the @xmath121 transition yielding the state @xmath122/2 $ ] , and consequent atomic detection in state @xmath118 , generating the desired superposition @xmath123 .",
    "note that in this case , the generation can be performed in a very short time and in our simulation , we have used a velocity @xmath124 m / s for the generating atom .     with ( top ) and without ( bottom )",
    "state protection .",
    "the atom velocity is @xmath96 m / s , and the cavity relaxation time is @xmath97 ms , while the other parameters are given in the text . the elapsed time is measured in both cases in terms of the number of atomic passages .",
    "time origin is given by the exit of the first atom generating the state out of the interaction region , and then each atomic passage lasts @xmath88 @xmath89s .",
    ", width=336 ]    the density matrix of the protected state after @xmath125 atomic passages ( see fig .",
    "5 ) clearly shows the effect of the feedback - induced `` square - root of phase diffusion '' discussed above .",
    "this phase diffusion manifests itself at long times , eventually driving the cavity mode into a stationary statistical mixture of fock states , corresponding to a rotationally invariant wigner function in phase space @xcite ( see also the wigner function of the protected state after @xmath126 atoms in fig .  3 , where the two gaussian peaks start to be stretched by phase diffusion ) .",
    "we have studied the time evolution of the fidelity @xmath127 and of the parity in this case , both in the presence ( stars connected with a dotted line ) and in the absence ( diamonds connected by a full line ) of quantum feedback ( see fig .",
    "the comparison between the protected and the unprotected evolution gives results slightly better than those of the cat state ( fig .",
    "4 ) , because the state ( especially its parity ) is preserved for a longer time ( up to 20 atoms when @xmath128 ms ) .",
    ", width=336 ]    as we have seen in section ii , and it is discussed in @xcite , this protection scheme is a stroboscopic version of the continuous photodetection feedback scheme described by the master equation ( [ meqfeed ] ) .",
    "therefore , we expect that fock number states of the cavity mode are particularly well protected because they are unaffected by the feedback - induced phase - diffusion process .",
    "we have verified this fact in the case of the one photon fock state and the results are shown in fig .  7 , where the time evolution of the fidelity @xmath129 and of the parity @xmath130 are shown .",
    "the first atom is very fast and generates the @xmath131 fock state with a simple resonant interaction latexmath:[$|e,0\\rangle \\rightarrow     @xmath105 ms , and the appreciable improvement of the fidelity shows that one can demonstrate a significant protection of a fock state using presently available experimental apparata .",
    "the @xmath131 state is easier to protect not only because is not affected by phase diffusion , but also because is less sensitive to the dispersive step ( b ) of the scheme .",
    "for this reason , we can use faster atoms and accordingly , smaller values of the detuning of step ( b ) . in fig .",
    "7 we have used @xmath133 m / s ( with @xmath134 khz ) and even @xmath135 m / s ( with @xmath136 khz ) .",
    "ms , while we have considered two velocities , @xmath133 m / s ( top ) and @xmath135 m / s ( bottom ) .",
    "the other parameter values are in the text .",
    ", width=336 ]    finally , it is also interesting to note that the proposed protection scheme could be even used for the _ generation _ of the @xmath131 fock state .",
    "in fact , as seen in section ii , state protection is obtained by projecting and eventually restoring the component with the desired parity .",
    "if one starts from a thermal equilibrium state with a low mean photon number @xmath137 so that @xmath138 are very small for @xmath139 , the successive application of the protection scheme for odd states will filter out mainly the @xmath131 component which is obviously a stationary state of the feedback process @xcite .",
    "the generation of the one photon fock state starting from a thermal equilibrium state with initial cavity mean photon number @xmath82 is shown in fig .  8 , where , again , the time evolution of the fidelity @xmath129 and of the parity are shown ( symbols are the same as those of figs .  4 , 6 , and 7 ) . in this case , there is no generation step and the first atom is used for feedback already .",
    "the plots referring to the case with no protection are obviously flat because the cavity mode is already at thermal equilibrium . as in fig .  7 , we have only considered the case with @xmath105 ms , and therefore the significant difference between the results with and without protection in fig .",
    "8 shows that fock state filtering from an initial thermal distribution could be implemented using the available experimental apparatus .",
    "note also that the states involved in the protection scheme are rotationally invariant in phase space , i.e. , are diagonal mixtures in the fock basis , which are less sensitive to the details of the dispersive step ( b ) .",
    "therefore , we have again used fast feedback atoms and consequently smaller values for the detuning of the dispersive step .",
    "we have used the same values of the single photon state of fig .  7 , @xmath133 m / s ( with @xmath134 khz ) , and @xmath135 m / s ( with @xmath136 khz ) .",
    "ms , and we have considered two velocities , @xmath133 m / s ( top ) , and @xmath135 m / s ( bottom ) .",
    "the other parameter values are in the text .",
    ", width=336 ]",
    "we have presented a scheme for the protection of a generic quantum state of a cavity mode with a definite parity , against the decohering effects of photon losses .",
    "the scheme is a further improvement of the quantum feedback schemes described in @xcite and is an example of a `` fully quantum feedback '' loop , where sensor , controller and actuator are all quantum system @xcite . in the present scheme ,",
    "all these roles are played by a single atom crossing the cavity mode .",
    "the scheme presents many analogies with quantum error correction codes , even though in our case , there is no explicit state encoding .",
    "in fact , the state to be corrected is already `` encoded '' within a parity eigenspace and the error ( a single photon loss ) maps this state into an orthogonal subspace , that is , that with opposite parity .",
    "then one corrects the error only within this orthogonal subspace . in this respect ,",
    "the atom plays the role of the `` error syndrome '' indicating the presence of the error .",
    "finally the correction is automatically implemented only if needed , by means of a kind of c - not gate between the atom ( control qubit ) and the cavity mode ( target qubit represented by the two parity eigenspaces ) .",
    "we have studied the performance of the proposed feedback scheme in the case of the cavity qed set up described in @xcite .",
    "we have numerically solved the exact master equation by choosing parameter values corresponding to those of @xcite .",
    "the only simplification adopted is that we have assumed that the circular rydberg atom are prepared one at a time with probability one in the set up . in other words",
    ", we have assumed a deterministic `` atomic gun '' .",
    "this condition is not verified by the present set up , where atomic pulses with a mean number of @xmath140 circular atoms per pulse are prepared .",
    "this fact would lower the efficiency of our scheme .",
    "however , this problem could be circumvented by detecting all the feedback atoms exiting the cavity and postselecting only the events with no missing feedback atom ( accepting all possible atomic states ) .",
    "we have considered well separated atoms ( @xmath141 mm ) between two successive feedback cycle , just to be sure to avoid any two - atom effect .",
    "one could increase the efficiency of the protection scheme by taking closer feedback atoms .",
    "for example , if we took an atomic separation of @xmath98 mm , the effective feedback cycle time would be halved , and it could still be possible to keep two - atoms effects negligible .    the experimental implementation of the present scheme , especially in the simplest cases of a one photon fock state ( figs .  7 and 8) or a superposition of fock states ( figs .",
    "5 and 6 ) is feasible with the presently available apparatus or with an apparatus with realistic improvements .",
    "its demonstration would represent the first implementation of decoherence control schemes based on quantum feedback ideas , and also the first example of control of a very common , and almost unavoidable , source of decoherence such as photon loss .",
