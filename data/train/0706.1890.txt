    "the present paper can be viewed as a continuation of the paper povolotsky priezzhev , where the transition probabilities for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) with parallel update have been obtained for the 1d infinite lattice , generalizing well - known result of schtz @xcite for the continuous time tasep .",
    "the analytic method , developed in the first half of that paper , was based on the use of bethe eigenvectors of the evolution operator obtained in @xcite .",
    "the problem was to find a continuous spectrum , i.e. the integration measure , which would allow one to construct the solutions of the master equation out of the bethe eigenvectors , and in particular would give a resolution of the identity operator in the integral form .",
    "the proof of the formula for the resolution of the identity operator , was the main technical result of the paper which yielded the final determinant formula for the transition probability .",
    "a peculiarity of the finite ring is that the spectrum becomes discrete due to the periodic boundary conditions , being defined by the system of the algebraic bethe equations ( be ) .",
    "these equations usually can not be solved exactly .",
    "most attempts to extract any information from them are related to the thermodynamic limit , where they can be reinterpreted in terms of a single integral equation .",
    "for the finite lattices , not only the exact form of the spectrum but even the issue of its completeness are far from being well understood for most of the integrable models .",
    "fortunately , for the tasep the situation is a bit better due to a very special factorization property possessed by the be .",
    "this property was observed already in one of the first works on the continuous time tasep by gwa and spohn @xcite , where it was used to get the asymptotical behaviour of the spectral gap .",
    "one of the most impressive results exploiting the special structure of the be in tasep was the exact derivation of the largest eigenvalue of the equation for the generating function of the integrated particle current , due to derrida and lebowitz @xcite . using the cauchy residue theorem",
    ", they managed to evaluate explicitly the sum over roots of the be for the particular solution corresponding to the groundstate of the evolution operator .",
    "recently , some peculiar details of the spectrum structure for the continuous time tasep have been also studied in @xcite .    the solution of the cauchy problem , i.e. finding the solution , given the initial conditions , for the master equation for the tasep on the ring in continuous time , and also with backward ordered update , has been recently proposed by one of the authors @xcite .",
    "to our knowledge , this is still the only example of full solution to the cauchy problem for an integrable model that can not be reduced to free fermions .",
    "the method of the solution is based on a geometric approach to the bethe ansatz ( ba ) , which treats trajectories of the interacting particles as free , noninteracting , but supplied with the additional statistical weights in such a way that the interaction is taken into account .",
    "the idea of the solution on a ring was to represent it as an infinite line with periodic patterns of synchronously moving interacting particles .",
    "as in the geometric formulation one works only with the ensembles of particle trajectories of a finite length , the issues related to the structure of the eigenspace of the evolution operator can be by - passed .",
    "motivated by the geometric solution , its analytic counterpart called the detailed ba has been also proposed @xcite . being defined on the infinite lattice , the detailed ba has a form of the infinite formal sum , and can be considered as a generating function of particle trajectories . as a result",
    ", the problem becomes infinite lattice - like and one can again use integration over the continuum to reconstruct the transition probabilities .",
    "the mathematical meaning of the term - by - term integration of the infinite formal series was not yet well understood ,  and , as we will see below , it is just equivalent to summation over the discrete spectrum given by the be .",
    "the geometric method was applied to the tasep with parallel update on the infinite lattice in the second half of our first paper @xcite .",
    "its generalization to the ring geometry follows in line with the continuous time version and as such is straightforward . therefore , the aim of this paper is not only to obtain the solution of the cauchy problem for the tasep with parallel update , but also to establish a bridge between existing solutions on a ring and the standard ba techniques .",
    "namely , we show that the idea of derrida and lebowitz exploiting the cauchy residue theorem to obtain the roots of the be corresponding to the groundstate solution can be developed much further and used to perform an exact summation over the whole spectrum of solutions .",
    "in such a way we obtain the integral representation for the resolution of the identity operator and , as a consequence , for the solution of the cauchy problem for the master equation as well .",
    "then we show that the expression under the integral can be expanded into a uniformly converging power series , equivalent to the detailed ba , which being integrated term by term yields finally the multiple infinite sums coming from the geometric solution and from the detailed ba .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we formulate the dynamical rules of the model and announce the final result . in section iii , we describe the ba for the infinite lattice and give the be for the ring . in section iv",
    ", we discuss the details of the analytic structure of the be solutions . in section",
    "v we develop a technique of evaluation of sums over the bethe roots . in section",
    "vi , we prove a formula for the resolution of the identity operator and obtain a formula for transition probabilities in the form of infinite sums .",
    "then , to show that the sums are actually finite , we estimate the number of nonzero terms they contain . in the last section vii",
    ", we discuss the results obtained and subsequent perspectives .",
    "we consider @xmath0 particles on the 1d ring consisting of @xmath1 sites .",
    "the notation @xmath2is used for the density of particles .",
    "the model has totally asymmetric dynamics , i.e. all particles jump only in one direction , which we refer to as forward . at each step of discrete time @xmath3 , a particle from each occupied site ,    i : :    _ takes one step forward with probability _",
    "@xmath4    or    ii : :    _ stays with probability _",
    "@xmath5 ,    provided that the target site is vacant .",
    "when the next site is occupied ,    iii : :    _ a particle stays with probability _ @xmath6 .",
    "all sites are updated simultaneously .",
    "we define a configuration @xmath7 of particles by the set of their coordinates @xmath8 , written in strictly increasing order , @xmath9the finite ring geometry implies also that the coordinates are confined to the values from @xmath6 to @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath10the probability @xmath11 for the system to be in a configuration @xmath7 at time @xmath3 obeys the markov equation@xmath12where @xmath13 is the probability of the transition from @xmath14 to @xmath7 for one time step .",
    "the transition probability @xmath15 defined by the above dynamical rules is a product of factors , each corresponding to a particular cluster of particles in the initial configuration @xmath16 .",
    "the word `` cluster '' refers to a group of particles , which has no empty sites between occupied sites and two empty sites at the ends .",
    "the value of these factors is either @xmath4  or @xmath5  depending on whether or not the first particle of a given cluster jumps during the transition from @xmath16  to @xmath17@xmath18here @xmath19 is the number of particles hopping from @xmath20-th cluster of @xmath14 , and @xmath21 is the number of clusters in @xmath16 .    it has been shown in @xcite that in the case of the infinite lattice , when constraint ( [ ring limits ] ) is omitted , the conditional probability , @xmath22 , for the system to be in a configuration @xmath8 at time @xmath3 , given it was in a configuration @xmath23 at time @xmath24 , is the following quotient @xmath25the function @xmath26 depending on two particle configurations @xmath27 and @xmath28 and on time @xmath3 is given by the determinant of @xmath29 matrix @xmath30 _ { 1\\leq i , j\\leq p } ,   \\label{f_infinity}\\]]where the matrix elements are defined in terms of a single function @xmath31 expressed via the gauss hypergeometric functions :    @xmath32    the notation @xmath33 is for the shifted factorial @xmath34 .",
    "the aim of the present article is to show that on the ring of size @xmath1 the same quantity @xmath22 is also given by similar quotient of two terms , both expressed as a single function @xmath35 of particle configurations @xmath36 and time @xmath3 , @xmath37with the arguments in the numerator and the denominator taken as in ( p(x , t|x_0,0 ) ) .",
    "however , for the finite ring , the function @xmath38 is the @xmath0-tuple sum of determinants @xmath39 _ { 1\\leq i , j\\leq p } ,   \\label{f(x , y , t)_ring}\\end{aligned}\\]]unlike the single determinant in the case of infinite lattice .",
    "the matrix elements of the corresponding matrices are still given in terms of the function @xmath40 defined in ( [ f(a , b , t ) ] ) , but its arguments depend now not only on the matrix indices @xmath41 but also on summation indices @xmath42 .",
    "below we argue that though formally the sums are infinite , they contain only a finite number of nonzero terms for any finite time @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore , the denominators of ( [ p(x , t|x_0,0 ) ] ) and ( f_ring ) depend only on the number of clusters in the corresponding configuration @xmath7 being equal to @xmath44    one has to define @xmath45 in ( [ f(x , x,0 ) ] ) as a function of @xmath7 separately for the infinite and finite lattices .",
    "indeed , the particles , which occupy the sites @xmath6 and @xmath1 on the ring , belong to the same cluster , while on the infinite lattice they do not . therefore",
    ", the value of @xmath46 can be different for these two cases , even though the coordinates of particles formally coincide .",
    "we first remind the reader of the technique used to deal with the infinite lattice case @xcite .",
    "consider @xmath0 particles on the infinite lattice .",
    "the particle configurations are given by @xmath47tuples of particle coordinates which are unbounded integers being selected from the set    @xmath48    let us introduce the infinite dimensional vector space @xmath49 over the field of complex numbers @xmath50 given by the linear span of the basis @xmath51i.e .",
    "the set of the vectors labelled by the particle configurations .",
    "in addition one introduces the basis of the dual space @xmath52 , which is the span of the dual basis , @xmath53with the inner product defined by @xmath54below the bases @xmath55,@xmath56 will be referred to as the configurational left and right bases respectively , unlike the left and right eigenbases of the evolution operator to be considered .",
    "the evolution operator @xmath57 is defined in terms of the transition probabilities @xmath15 defined in ( [ transition probability])@xmath58the problem under consideration is to find the transition probability @xmath59 from a configuration @xmath60 to @xmath7 for @xmath3 steps , which is nothing but the corresponding matrix element of the operator @xmath61 @xmath62    it was shown in @xcite , @xcite that the evolution operator @xmath57 has the left and right eigenvectors @xmath63 , @xmath64 parametrized by @xmath0-tuple complex parameter @xmath65the eigenvectors corresponding to the same value of @xmath66 solve the left and right eigenproblems , @xmath67associated with the same eigenvalue @xmath68where we introduce the parameter @xmath69 @xmath70the projection @xmath71 of the right eigenvector @xmath63 to the configuration @xmath7 is given by the bethe ansatz @xmath72supplied with the additional configuration - dependent factor @xmath73 .",
    "the latter is proportional to the stationary measure of the configuration @xmath7 and is defined in terms of the number of clusters @xmath74 in the configuration @xmath7 @xmath75the amplitudes @xmath76 , are indexed by the permutations @xmath77 @xmath78 of the integers @xmath79 .",

    "this property allows one to represent the amplitude @xmath76 in a simple product form @xmath87where each multiple depends only on one of the parameters @xmath88 . unlike the right eigenvector , the left one",
    ", @xmath89 has no factor @xmath73 , while the bethe part can be obtained from that of ( [ bethe ansatz_right ] ) by the change @xmath90 , @xmath91.@xmath92then , that the projection of the eigenvectors @xmath93 and @xmath71 to the basis vectors corresponding to a particular configuration @xmath7 can be represented in the form of determinants@xmath94where the matrix elements @xmath95 and @xmath96 are given by@xmath97one of the main results of  @xcite is the proof of the formula for the resolution of the identity operator , @xmath98where @xmath99 is the identity operator , @xmath100 is the integration measure , and the integration is performed independentlyover each @xmath85 along the contour @xmath101 encircling the points @xmath102 and @xmath103 , while the point @xmath104 stays outside ( figure [ contour ] ) .",
    "practically the proof was given by the direct evaluation of the integral in the configurational basis,@xmath105    as soon as the equality ( [ completeness ] ) is established , one can insert the identity operator into the matrix elements , @xmath106so that the final result ( [ p(x , t|x_0,0)]-[f(a , b , t ) ] ) immediately follows from the explicit form of the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors .",
    "one of the observations made in @xcite was that there is no any obvious procedure of choosing a contour and a measure of integration .",
    "however , validity of a particular choice can be verified a posteriori by proving the resolution of the identity operator , which is fulfilled by a direct evaluation of l.h.s . of ( [ completeness(basis ) ] ) .",
    "it will be clear below that the form of the contour can be validated directly by considering the infinite lattice as a limiting case of the ring of the size @xmath107 , which grows to infinity .",
    "then , the @xmath108spectrum of the model is obtained as a continuous limit of the discrete spectrum for the finite system .",
    "what does change when one confines the system to the ring of finite length @xmath109 ?",
    "apparently , the total number of particle configurations becomes finite .",
    "the same must be true for the dimension of vector space @xmath110 defined as the span of the basis @xmath111where @xmath112 is the domain for particle coordinates on the ring .",
    "@xmath113as before , the dual space @xmath114 is spanned by the dual basis @xmath115with the inner product defined by @xmath116obviously , the dimensions of the spaces are equal to the total number of the basis vectors , which is equal to the number of particle configurations:@xmath117the solution of the eigenproblem turns out to be analogous to the infinite lattice case .",
    "the only though important difference is that , due to the finite dimension of the vector space , a finite number of independent eigenvectors can exist .",
    "technically this follows from the fact that vectors @xmath63 and @xmath64 are now the eigenvectors of @xmath57 only for a finite discrete set of the values of the parameter @xmath66 .",
    "this set is to be defined from the system of algebraic equations , which follow from imposing the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this is the set one has to sum over , when constructing the resolution of the identity operator similar to ( [ completeness ] ) .",
    "of course the latter is correct provided that this set is large enough to ensure that the corresponding eigenvectors to form the complete bases of @xmath110 and @xmath114    for further convenience we slightly generalize the problem . consider the generating function @xmath118 of the joint probability @xmath119 for the system to be in a configuration @xmath7 at time @xmath43 , the total distance travelled by particles being @xmath120 , given the initial configuration @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath121the evolution equation for @xmath122 is similar to the original equation ( [ master ] ) for the probability , with the only minor change : the transition probabilities must be multiplied by the factor @xmath123 per each jumping particle : @xmath124apparently , the limit @xmath125 restores the original markov equation for the probability of a configuration @xmath126all elements of the above bethe ansatz technique can be directly extended to the case of nonzero @xmath127 yielding a minor change in the eigenvalue ( [ lambda(z ) ] ) @xmath128and in the scattering factor ( [ s ] ) @xmath129which in turn changes the ba amplitudes , ( [ a_sigma ] ) @xmath130these amplitudes being substituted to the the ba for the right and left eigenvectors(bethe ansatz_right,[bethe ansatz left ] ) yield an expression for the eigenvectors of @xmath131 .",

    "first , it looks possible to generalize the method to extract not only the sum over the solutions of the be , but also to extract the contribution of particular solutions . in this way one could obtain closed exact expressions for particular eigenvalues and eigenvectors , rather than only the asymptotic behaviour studied before .",
    "second , the integral representation obtained can be useful to study the large time asymptotics for the growth phenomena with time .",
    "many similar results where obtained recently for the infinite lattice , due to the observed parallels with the theory of random matrix ensembles @xcite .",
    "the bethe ansatz , giving the integral representations of the physical quantities like particle current probability distribution , could also be a starting point of such an asymptotical analysis .",
    "particularly , the result of present paper could be used to make an advance for the ring geometry where not much results have been obtained yet .",
