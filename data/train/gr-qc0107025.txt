    "classical continuum theories are based on the assumption that the state of a body is determined entirely by the behavior of an arbitrary infinitesimal neighborhood centered at any of its material points .",

    "clearly , the influence of the neighborhood on motions of the material points , emerging as a result of the interatomic interaction of the rest of the body , is neglected .",
    "moreover , the isolation of an arbitrary small part of the body to represent the whole clearly ignores the effects of the action of the applied load at a distance .",
    "these applied loads are important because their transmissions from one part of the body to another , through their common boundaries affect the motions , hence the state of the body at every point .",
    "the relevance of long - range or nonlocal outcomes on the mechanical properties of materials are well known .",
    "the main ideas of nonlocal continuum mechanics were introduced during the 1960s ( see @xcite and references therein ) and are based on considering the stress to be a function of the mean of the strain from a certain representative volume of the material centered at that point . since then , there have been many situations of common occurrence wherein nonlocal effects seem to dominate the macroscopic behavior of matter .",
    "interesting problems coming from a wide variety of areas such as damage and cracking analysis of materials , surface phenomena between two liquids or two phases , mechanics of liquid crystals , blood flow , dynamics of colloidal suspensions seem to demand this type of nonlocal approach which has made this area very active concerning recent developments in material and fluid science and engineering .",

    "additional physical insight of the nonlocality for this particular equation of state can be gained by considering equation ( [ globalst ] ) re - written as @xmath7 clearly the nonlocal term represents an average of the function @xmath4 over the volume enclosed by the radius @xmath8 .",

    "althought , we supposed to have found a more general family of solutions for the einstein equations , ( [ beta ] ) , than the one considered in @xcite but , due to the boundary conditions ( [ zeroc ] ) , the actual family of solutions is indeed the previous ( [ oldsoluc ] ) considered in reference ( [ oldsoluc ] ) .",
    "it is also obtained credible anisotropic spherically matter configurations with a _",
    "nles _ for two particular cases : one where the radial pressure vanishes , i.e. , @xmath16 and @xmath17 and other where the tangential pressures vanishes , i.e. , @xmath18 and @xmath19    we worked out in detail the junction and energy conditions for anisotropic ( and isotropic ) bounded matter distributions , i.e. ( [ mas2r ] ) thought ( [ domenetg ] ) , establishing their consequences in terms of the mass function @xmath62 for bounded configurations having _ nles . _ in the early days of relativistic astrophysics , some of these results led to the first general theorems due to h. a. buchdahl@xcite and h. bondi@xcite concerning inequalities limiting the behavior of the mass function for compact objects .",
    "because the mass function @xmath33 presented in equations ( [ examp1 ] ) through ( [ examp6 ] ) and the corresponding pressure profiles are regular at the origin , the solutions to the einstein equations are considered unique in the sense stated by rendall and collaborators@xcite .",
    "that is to say : for a given value of the central pressure , @xmath153 , there exists a unique global solution @xmath5 to the anisotropic tov equation ( [ anitov ] ) representing a spherically symmetric fluid sphere in general relativity .",
    "it is clear that the last term in the anisotropic tov equation ( [ anitov ] ) , @xmath154 represents a `` force '' due to the local anisotropy .",
    "this `` force '' is directed outward when @xmath155 and inward if @xmath156 . as it is apparent from the figure and also from the above table , those models with a ( average ) repulsive `` anisotropic '' force ( @xmath157 ) allows the construction of more massive distributions .",
    "this picture is more evident for solutions where @xmath16 and @xmath17 and @xmath18 and @xmath158 which are the extreme situations .",
    "considering plausible static matter configurations ( it is to say those that satisfy conditions ( [ mas2r ] ) thought ( [ domenetg ] ) ) we have    * more massive configurations if the radial pressure vanishes i.e. @xmath157 has a maximum , * less massive configurations if the tangential pressures vanishes i.e. @xmath159 has a minimum .    notice that model 4 ( _ nles _ tolman iv anisotropic static solution )  and model 5 ( _ nles _ anisotropic wyman like static solution ) have `` soft '' ( @xmath160 ) cores and `` hard '' ( @xmath161 ) outer mantles .",
    "it is worth mentioning that models presented here are very sensitive to the change of values of the parameters sketched in the table .",
    "as it can be appreciated from equation ( [ cerosdeme ] ) , fluids satisfying _ nles _ and having vanishing tangential pressures are only possible within a region of the matter configuration with @xmath162   ~<~r~<~a.$ ] within the inner core , the mass function becomes negative .",
    "this situation emerges from a limitation of the definition of the schwarzschild mass function ( [ eme ] ) when it is apply to anisotropic fluid configurations .",
    "it is interesting to say that the expression of the tolman whittaker mass@xcite@xmath163 for this static _ nles _ model reads @xmath164 and precludes non physical situations at the core of the distribution .",
    "it is clear that for this case the tolman - whittaker mass function , @xmath165 is a more suitable concept of mass than the schwarzschild mass function , @xmath166 ( see @xcite for a comprehensive discussion on this point , plentiful of examples ) .",
    "more over , from equations ( [ mpr0 ] ) and ( [ mtwpt0 ] ) , the expression of the @xmath167 for this particular static _ nles _ model with vanishing tangential stresses is the same that @xmath166 for the model with vanishing radial pressure .",
    "it can also be mentioned as a curiosity that the relation among the areas under the curves displayed in the figure , i.e. @xmath168corresponds to the relation among de total masses .",
    "the more massive the model is the greater the area under the curve @xmath169 is .    in principle , a _ nles _ in isotropic pascalian fluid ( @xmath170 ) can not be ruled out , but we have integrated numerically the standard tov equation ( [ anitov ] ) , which can be written in terms of the mass distribution function as @xmath171 \\qquad\\mathrm{with}\\qquad\\left\\ { \\begin{array } [ c]{c}% m(0)=0\\\\ \\\\ m^{\\prime}(0)=0 \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] and the inequalities ( [ mas2r ] ) thought ( [ strgenerani1 ] ) ( or ( [ mas2r ] ) thought ( [ velsonid ] ) and ( [ domener ] ) & ( [ domenetg ] ) ) corresponding the physical and energy conditions * were not * fulfilled for any configuration having a _",
