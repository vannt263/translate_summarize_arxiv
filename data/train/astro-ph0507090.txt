    "many high - energy astrophysical problems involve relativistic flows , and thus understanding relativistic flows is important for correctly interpreting astrophysical phenomena .",
    "for instance , intrinsic beam velocities larger than @xmath0 are typically required to explain the apparent superluminal motions observed in relativistic jets in microquasars in the galaxy @xcite as well as in extragalactic radio sources associated with active galactic nuclei @xcite . in some powerful extragalactic radio sources , ejections from galactic nuclei produce true beam velocities of more than @xmath1 .",
    "relativistic descriptions are also inevitable in other situations of rapid expansion such as the early stages of supernova explosions @xcite and the production of energetic gamma - ray bursts @xcite . in the general fireball model of gamma - ray bursts ,",
    "the internal energy of gas is converted into the bulk kinetic energy during expansion and this expansion leads to relativistic outflows with high bulk lorentz factors @xmath2 .",
    "since such relativistic flows are highly nonlinear and intrinsically complex , in addition to possessing large lorentz factors , often studying them _ numerically _ is the only possible approach .    for numerical study of non - relativistic hydrodynamics ,",
    "explicit finite difference upwind schemes have been developed and implemented successfully .",
    "the schemes which have been used for astrophysical researches include the roe scheme @xcite , the total variation diminishing ( tvd ) scheme @xcite , the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) scheme @xcite , and the essentially non - oscillatory ( eno ) scheme @xcite .",

    "although it is possible to implement this linearizion technique in the relativistic domain in a computationally feasible way ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there is unlikely to be a significant advantage from the computational point of view . instead , we simply calculate the algebraic averages of quantities at two adjacent cell centers to define the physical quantities at the cell interfaces ; @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99^{1/2}.\\ ] ]      to extend the one - dimensional code to multidimensions , the procedure described in the previous subsection is applied separately to the @xmath20 and @xmath21-directions .",

    "a problem with the numerical approach is , however , that iterations can fail to converge .",
    "for instance , convergence can fail if one of the relativistic conditions is violated due to numerical errors , e.g. , @xmath115 , in a cell .",
    "this occurs mostly in extreme regimes .",
    "in addition , we found that convergence is often slow or sometimes fails in the limit @xmath116 . on the other hand ,",
    "quartic equations have analytic solutions .",
    "the general form of roots can be found in standard books such as @xcite or on webs such as `` http://mathworld.wolfram.com/quarticequation.html '' .",

    "so the larger real root is the one we are looking for , and we use its analytic formula in our code .",

    "<S> this paper describes a multidimensional hydrodynamic code which can be used for studies of relativistic astrophysical flows . </S>",
    "<S> the code solves the special relativistic hydrodynamic equations as a hyperbolic system of conservation laws based on the total variation diminishing ( tvd ) scheme . </S>",
    "<S> it uses a new set of conserved quantities and employs an analytic formula for transformation from the conserved quantities in the reference frame to the physical quantities in the local rest frame . </S>",
    "<S> several standard tests , including relativistic shock tubes , a relativistic wall shock , and a relativistic blast wave , are presented to demonstrate that the code captures discontinuities correctly and sharply in ultrarelativistic regimes . </S>",
    "<S> the robustness and flexibility of the code are demonstrated through test simulations of the relativistic hawley - zabusky shock and a relativistic extragalactic jet .    </S>",
