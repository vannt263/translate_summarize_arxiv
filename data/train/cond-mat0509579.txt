    "in high-@xmath5 cuprate superconductors ( htcs ) the microwave response has been extensively investigated in order to get information , among the others , on the symmetry of the order parameter , on the vortex parameters such as the vortex viscosity and pinning frequency @xcite and on the temperature dependence of the superfluid fraction ( via the measurement of the temperature dependence of the london penetration depth @xcite ) . in the vortex state",
    "the response has been analysed mainly in terms of vortex motion , often assuming that the field dependence of the quasiparticle ( qp ) and the superfluid ( sf ) could be neglected .",
    "however , there are some experimental results that point to a very relevant role of qp / sf in the determination of the high - frequency response in the vortex state . in particular , in bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath4 ( bscco )",
    "it has been shown that , at low enough temperatures , the imaginary sub - terahertz conductivity is entirely due to the strong field dependent superfluid depletion in a superconductor with lines of nodes in the gap @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have recently shown @xcite that in smba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( smbco ) thin films the 48 ghz microwave resistivity is made up by two markedly different contributions , namely a linear ( in the field induction @xmath6 ) term , due to the vortex motion , that appears in the real part of the microwave resistivity only ( due to the fact that at high frequencies the vortex motion is purely dissipative ) , and a sublinear one , @xmath7 , which reflects the strong pair breaking outside the vortex cores @xcite .",
    "noticeably , in smbco the field - dependent qp / sf response is detected up to very close to @xmath5 .",
    "aim of this paper is to present a compared study of the microwave response of smbco , yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( ybco ) and bscco in the vortex state in moderate fields , for temperatures not too far from @xmath5 . by assuming that the linear term in the real resistivity is due to vortex motion",
    ", we can directly extract the complex qp / sf conductivity .",
    "we find that ybco and smbco behave similarly , and that the description based on flux flow + sf depletion is fully consistent with the data .",
    "by contrast , this framework does not apply to bscco , where it seems that vortex motion does not play any relevant role in our temperature and field ranges . in this compound",
    ", the conductivity seems to be due solely to field induced qp / sf variations .",
    "the samples under investigation are highly oriented , 200 nm thin films of ybco , smbco and bscco .",
    "preparation details and crystallographic characterization are reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "critical temperatures are 87 , 86.5 and 89 k respectively , as estimated from the crossing of the microwave real and imaginary fluctuation conductivity @xcite ( the typical @xmath80.5k uncertainty of this method is inessential for the purposes of the present paper ) . the @xmath0-plane complex resistivity @xmath9 is measured with a metal cylindrical resonant cavity , operating in the te@xmath10 mode at @xmath11=48.2 ghz in the end - wall - replacement configuration .",
    "a moderate magnetic field , aligned with the c axis , is swept at each temperature from 0 to @xmath120.8 t ( we expect that the approximate equality between applied and internal field can be inaccurate at very low fields only ) . in the temperature range here",
    "explored , @xmath1370 k , the thin - film approximation is justified @xcite and measurements of the field - induced shifts of @xmath14 factor and @xmath11 yield the field - induced variations of the complex resistivity , @xmath15 , at fixed temperatures .",
    "the determination of @xmath15 requires only the knowledge of geometrical factors ; absolute values of @xmath16 require the cavity calibration . in the following",
    "we will use normalized resistivities , defined as @xmath17 , with @xmath18 , and the corresponding normalized field variations @xmath19 .",
    "experimental results are as follow : the two rebco samples show a similar behaviour in the entire temperature range examined up to near @xmath5 .",
    "measurements , plotted as a function of @xmath20 , are reported in fig.1 for a selected set of field sweeps at different temperatures for the ybco sample .     in ybco at selected temperatures .",
    "main panel : @xmath21 ; inset : @xmath22.,width=245 ]    it can be noted that @xmath22 is well approximated by a straight line , which corresponds to a @xmath23 dependence .",
    "moreover , @xmath22 changes from positive to negative as the temperature increases , but without changing the functional dependence on the magnetic field .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath21 is always positive : an additional upward curvature in the data plotted as a function of @xmath20 indicates the presence of both a square root and a linear term in the @xmath6 dependence .     in bscco at selected temperatures .",
    "open symbols : @xmath21 ; full symbols : @xmath22.,width=245 ]    we now examine the measurements in bscco , where significant differences with respect to the behaviour of rebco are observed ( fig .",
    "2 ) . in the temperature region above 78 k @xmath24 is always decreasing , but shows a @xmath6 dependence made up of a combination of a linear term and a square - root one .",
    "@xmath25 , on the other hand , has essentially a @xmath20 dependence up to 85k , where it starts to change to a linear @xmath6 dependence , which holds up to 95 k ( well above @xmath5 ) .",
    "it appears that the behaviour in bscco is somewhat reversed with respect to smbco and ybco , exhibiting a dominant @xmath20 term in the real part of the resistivity and a significant @xmath26 term in the imaginary part .",
    "we will discuss in the following section the indications that can be gained from this experimental behaviour .",
    "as extensively discussed in @xcite , at high enough frequencies , low fields , and not too close to @xmath5 , the vortex motion and qp / sf contributions to the microwave complex resistivity are additive , and one can write @xmath27 , with :    @xmath28    @xmath29    where we have explicitly indicated the vortex motion and the qp / sf terms , the latter approximate equality holds as an expansion for small fields , and we have cosidered the fact that the superfluid fraction decreases as @xmath20 in a superconductor with lines of nodes @xcite . in this framework , @xmath30 are related to vortex motion .",
    "we note that the knowledge of @xmath31 and of the vortex motion terms @xmath30 allows for the inversion of the qp / sf terms and the determination of the field - dependent conductivity due to to qp and sf only .",
    "+ we will discuss the data in the light of eq.s [ empirical1],[empirical2 ] . due to their similarity , we discuss first the results in ybco and smbco , and we successively consider the results in bscco .",
    "the experimental results obtained for the two rebco samples find a very satisfactory explanation in terms of eq.s [ empirical1],[empirical2 ] in the free - flux - flow limit ( see @xcite for an extended data presentation and discussion in smbco ) .",
    "therefore , once the coefficient @xmath32 are known , the qp / sf conductivity can be extracted by subtracting the linear terms from the total resistivity and inverting the relation .",
    "the result is given in fig .",
    "3 for the superfluid ( imaginary ) conductivity @xmath33 in smbco and ybco : it can be clearly seen that @xmath33 shows a remarkable @xmath34 trend , in agreement with the prediction of the @xmath20 dependence for the superfluid density in a nodal superconductor .",
    "is the film thickness ) vs @xmath35 at selected temperatures in ybco , smbco and bscco ( from top to bottom ) .",
    "the @xmath23 behaviour , as expected for a superconductor with lines of nodes in the gap is ubiquitous ( straight lines through the data points are guides for the eye ) . only in bscco at high temperatures the field dependence switches to linear , @xmath26.,width=245 ]    for the bscco sample we initially note that above @xmath3688 k @xmath37 has evolved from a square root to a pure linear @xmath6 dependence . since the latter field dependence continues through and above the critical temperature , we argue that at high temperatures the response is dominated by fluctuations , which we will analyze in a future work .",
    "we therefore consider the temperature range below 88k .",
    "we first note that the imaginary resistivity is a decreasing function of the magnetc field , thus ruling out possible strong pinning effects ( we remind that conventional vortex motion requires @xmath38 in the strong pinning regime @xcite )",
    ". it would be then natural to apply the framewok based on flux flow + pair breaking , as successfully applied in rebco .",
    "however , this approach does not appear to be consistent : in fact , there is no evident linear term in the real part of the field - induced resistivity variation , while a linear term is present in the imaginary part .",
    "this is somewhat puzzling in the frame of a conventional vortex dynamics . while complex vortex dynamics can not be definitely ruled out , in order to explore other alternative scenarios we consider a somewhat opposite ( and oversimplified ) view : we assume that the measured complex resistivity is entirely determined by the field dependence of charge carriers conductivity , with no relevant contribution from the vortex motion . in this frame",
    ", the measured @xmath39 can be directly inverted to obtain @xmath33 .",
    "the result is given in fig .",
    "3 , lower panel , in which @xmath33 shows a remarkable @xmath34 trend up to near @xmath5 , where it deviates upon entering the different ( fluctuational ) regime .",
    "the total irrelevance of vortex motion contribution is clearly an oversimplification , and more accurate models should take the vortex motion into account .",
    "nevertheless , neglecting the vortex contribution brings the qp / sf conductivity of bscco in close similarity to the one obtained in ybco and smbco .",
    "we have reported measurements of the complex resistivity @xmath16 in a static applied field for three hts materials , ybco , smbco and bscco . both rebco samples showed a @xmath6 dependence satisfactorily explained as standard vortex dynamics added to a @xmath34 pair - breaking term for the superfluid density , as expected for superconductors with nodes in gap .",
    "on the other hand , the bscco sample showed a field - induced variation of @xmath16 inconsistent with standard vortex dynamics .",
    "by contrast , exploiting an oversimplified model where no relevant vortex contribution is present , and the whole response is due to the quasiparticle increase due to the strong field - induced pair breaking in a nodal supeconductor , the obtained superfluid conductivity @xmath33 is found to be consistent with theoretical expectations and with the @xmath33 determined in rebco . in all cases",
    "it appears that field induced qp excitations play an essential role , as witnessed by the clear @xmath20 dependence of @xmath33 ."
