    "the past several years have witnessed dramatic progress in our understanding of gluon scattering amplitudes , especially in the maximally supersymmetric @xmath2 super - yang - mills theory ( sym ) .",
    "these advances have provided a pleasing mix of theoretical insights , shedding light on the mathematical structure of amplitudes and their role in gauge / string duality , and more practical results , including impressive new technology for carrying out previously impossible calculations at tree level and beyond .",
    "it has recently been pointed out  @xcite that there are reasons to suspect @xmath3 supergravity ( sugra ) to have even richer structure and to be ultimately even simpler than sym . despite great progress",
    "@xcite however , our understanding of sugra amplitudes is still poor compared to sym , suggesting that we are still missing some key insights into this problem .",
    "nowhere is the disparity between our understanding of sym and sugra more transparent than in the expressions for what should be their simplest nontrivial scattering amplitudes , those describing the interaction of 2 particles of one helicity with @xmath4 particles of the opposite helicity . in sym",
    "these maximally helicity violating ( mhv ) amplitudes are encapsulated in the stunningly simple formula conjectured by parke and taylor  @xcite and proven by berends and giele  @xcite , which we express here ( as throughout this paper ) in on - shell @xmath2 superspace @xmath5 in contrast , all known explicit formulas for @xmath6-graviton mhv amplitudes are noticeably more complicated .",
    "the first such formula was conjectured 20 years ago  @xcite and a handful of alternative expressions of more or less the same degree of complexity have appeared more recently  @xcite .    beyond mhv",
    "amplitudes the situation is even less satisfactory , though the kawai - lewellen - tye ( klt ) relations  @xcite may be used in principle to express any desired amplitude as a complicated sum of various permuted squares of gauge theory amplitudes and other factors .",
    "these relations are a consequence of the relation between open and closed string amplitudes , but they remain completely obscure at the level of the einstein - hilbert lagrangian  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present an algorithm for writing down an arbitrary tree - level sugra amplitude .",
    "our result was largely made possible by combining and extending the results of two recent papers . in  @xcite an explicit formula for all tree amplitudes in sym",
    "was found by solving the supersymmetric version  @xcite of the on - shell recursion relation  @xcite , greatly extending an earlier solution  @xcite for split - helicity amplitudes only .",
    "we will review all appropriate details in a moment , but for now it suffices to write their formula for the color - ordered sym amplitude @xmath7 very schematically as @xmath8 where the sum runs over a collection of dual superconformal  @xcite invariants @xmath9 .",
    "the set @xmath10 is dictated by whether @xmath11 is mhv ( in which case there is obviously only a single term , 1 , in the sum ) , next - to - mhv ( nmhv ) , next - to - next - to - mhv ( nnmhv ) , etc .",
    "our second inspiration is an intriguing formula for the @xmath6-graviton mhv amplitude obtained by elvang and freedman  @xcite which has the feature of expressing the amplitude in terms of sums of squares of gluon amplitudes , in spirit similar to though in detail very different from the klt relations .",
    "their formula reads @xmath12 ^ 2 \\ , g^{\\rm mhv}(1,\\ldots , n)\\,,\\ ] ] where the sum runs over all permutations of the labels @xmath13 through @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a particular ` gravity factor ' reviewed below .",
    "our result involves a natural merger of  ( [ eqone ] ) and  ( [ eqtwo ] ) , expressing an arbitrary @xmath6-graviton super - amplitude in the form @xmath16 ^ 2 \\sum _ { \\{\\alpha \\ } } [ r_\\alpha(\\lambda_i , \\widetilde{\\lambda}_i , \\eta_i ) ] ^2 \\ , g_\\alpha(\\lambda_i , \\widetilde{\\lambda}_i)\\,.\\ ] ] two important features worth pointing out are that the sum runs over precisely the same set @xmath10 that appears in the sym case  ( [ eqone ] ) , rather than some kind of double sum as one might have guessed , and that the ` gravity dressing factors ' @xmath17 do not depend on the fermionic coordinates @xmath18 of the on - shell @xmath3 superspace .",
    "all of the ` super ' structure of the amplitudes is completely encoded in the same @xmath19-factors that appear already in the sym amplitudes .",
    "we begin in the next section by reviewing some of the necessary tools for carrying out our calculation . in section",
    "iii we provide detailed derivations of explicit formulas for mhv , nmhv , and nnmhv amplitudes . finally in section",
    "iv we discuss the structure of the gravity dressing factors @xmath17 for more general graviton amplitudes .",
    "we will use the supersymmetric version  @xcite of the on - shell recursion relation  @xcite @xmath20 where we follow the conventions of  @xcite in choosing the supersymmetry preserving shift @xmath21 so that the sum in  ( [ sbcf ] ) runs over all factorization channels of @xmath22 which separate particle @xmath23 and particle @xmath6 ( into @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively ) .",
    "the value of the shift parameter @xmath26 is chosen so that the shifted intermediate momentum @xmath27 goes on - shell at @xmath28 .",
    "the recursion relation  ( [ sbcf ] ) can be seeded with the fundamental 3-particle amplitudes  @xcite @xmath29      ) between a physical gravity amplitude @xmath22 and the sum over its ordered subamplitudes @xmath30 .",
    "we draw an arrow indicating the cyclic order of the indices between the special legs @xmath6 and @xmath23.,title=\"fig : \" ] -0.5",
    "cm    color - ordered amplitudes in sym have a cyclic structure such that only those factorizations preserving the cyclic labeling of the external particles appear in the analogous recursion  ( [ sbcf ] ) .",
    "in contrast , gravity amplitudes must be completely symmetric under the exchange of any particle labels , so vastly more factorizations contribute to  ( [ sbcf ] )",
    ". we can deal with this complication once and for all by introducing the notion of an ordered ` gravity subamplitude ' @xmath30 .",
    "these non - physical but mathematically useful objects are related to the complete , physical amplitudes @xmath22 via the relation @xmath31 depicted graphically in  .",
    "this decomposition only makes a subgroup of the full permutation symmetry manifest .",
    "however it is the largest subgroup that the recursion  ( [ sbcf ] ) allows us to preserve since two external lines are singled out for special treatment .",
    "the relation  ( [ main ] ) does not uniquely determine the subamplitudes for a given @xmath22 , since one could add to @xmath30 any quantity which vanishes after summing over permutations .",
    "we choose to define the subamplitudes @xmath32 recursively via  ( [ sbcf ] ) restricted to factorizations which preserve the cyclic ordering of the indices , just like in sym theory : @xmath33 this recursion is also seeded with the three - point amplitudes  ( [ threepoint ] ) since there is no distinction between @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "note however that unlike the color - ordered sym amplitudes @xmath7 , the gravity subamplitude @xmath30 is _ not _ in general invariant under cyclic permutations of its arguments .",
    "it remains to prove the consistency of this definition .",
    "that is , we need to check that the subamplitudes defined in  ( [ mdef ] ) , when substituted into  ( [ main ] ) , do in fact give correct expressions for the physical gravity amplitude @xmath22 .",
    "this straightforward combinatorics exercise proceeds by induction , beginning with the @xmath36 case which is trivial and then assuming that  ( [ main ] ) is correct up to and including @xmath14 gravitons . for @xmath6 gravitons",
    "we then have @xmath37 the first line is the superrecursion for the physical amplitude , including a sum over all partitions of @xmath38 into two subsets @xmath11 and @xmath39 , not just those which preserve a cyclic ordering . in the second line",
    "we have thrown in a spurious sum over all permutations of @xmath38 at the cost of dividing by @xmath40 to compensate for the overcounting .",
    "this is allowed since we know that @xmath22 is completely symmetric under the exchange of any of its arguments .",
    "inside the sum over permutations we are then free to choose @xmath41 and @xmath42 as indicated on the third line , including the factor @xmath43 to count the number of times this particular term appears . on the fourth line",
    "our prior assumption that  ( [ main ] ) holds up to @xmath14 particles allows us to replace @xmath44 inside the sum over permutations .",
    "the last line invokes the definition  ( [ mdef ] ) and completes the proof that the physical @xmath6-graviton amplitude may be recovered from the ordered subamplitudes via  ( [ main ] ) and the definition  ( [ mdef ] ) .",
    "the astute reader may have objected already to  ( [ eqtwo ] ) in the introduction .",
    "the sym mhv amplitude  ( [ amhv ] ) involves the delta function @xmath45 expressing conservation of the total supermomentum @xmath46 since the square of a fermionic delta function is zero , it would seem that it makes no sense for the quantity @xmath47 ^ 2 $ ] to appear in  ( [ eqtwo ] ) .    throughout this paper",
    "it will prove extremely convenient to adopt the convention that the square of an @xmath1 superspace expression refers to an @xmath0 superspace expression in the most natural way .",
    "for example , it should always be understood that @xmath48 ^ 2 = \\delta^{(16)}(q)\\,,\\ ] ] where the @xmath49 on the right - hand side is given by the same expression  ( [ qdef ] ) but with @xmath50 .",
    "this notation will prove especially useful for lifting results of grassmann integration from @xmath2 to @xmath3 superspace .",
    "this trick works because we can break the @xmath51 symmetry of a @xmath52 integration into @xmath53 by taking @xmath54 for @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "then every @xmath58 integral can be rewritten as a product of two sym integrals and the @xmath51 symmetry of the answer is restored simply by adopting the convention  ( [ convention ] ) .    for a specific example",
    "consider the basic sym integral @xmath59 which expresses the superrecursion for the case of mhv amplitudes . by ` squaring ' this formula we immediately obtain the answer for a similar @xmath3 grassmann integral , @xmath60 ^ 2 [ a^{\\rm mhv}(-\\widehat{p},3,\\ldots,\\overline{n})]^2 = p^2 \\frac{\\delta^{(16)}(p ) } { ( \\ket{1}{2 } \\ket{2}{3 } \\cdots \\ket{n}{1})^2}\\,.\\ ] ] note the extra factor of @xmath61 which appears on the right - hand side because we have , for obvious reasons , chosen not to square the propagator @xmath62 on the left .",
    "given the above considerations it should come as no surprise that we will be able to import much of the structure of sym amplitudes directly into our sugra results . therefore we now review the results of  @xcite for tree amplitudes in sym . here and in all that follows",
    "we use the standard dual superconformal  @xcite notation @xmath63 where all subscripts are understood mod @xmath6 .",
    "we will base our expression for the sugra amplitudes on an expression for the sym amplitudes which is equivalent to , but not exactly the same as the one presented in  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the cyclic symmetry of the yang - mills amplitudes implies certain identities for the invariants @xmath9 appearing in  ( [ eqone ] ) .",
    "this symmetry was used in  @xcite when solving the recursion relations .",
    "instead it is helpful to have a different expression which is more suitable to the gravity case where the subamplitudes @xmath32 do not have cyclic symmetry .    to be precise we need to return to the construction of  @xcite and make sure that when considering the right - hand side of the bcf recursion relation we always insert the lower point amplitudes so that leg 1 of the left amplitude factor corresponds to the shifted leg @xmath64 .",
    "we also need to have the leg @xmath6 of the right amplitude factor corresponding to the shifted leg @xmath65 , but this was already the choice made in  @xcite .",
    "the expression for all @xmath66 sym amplitudes is given in terms of paths in a particular rooted tree diagram .",
    "here we will be using a different ( but equivalent ) diagram , shown in  .",
    "each vertex in the diagram , say with labels @xmath67 , corresponds to a particular dual conformal invariant .",
    "these invariants take the general form @xcite @xmath68 where the chiral spinor @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 as in  @xcite this expression needs to be slightly modified when any @xmath71 index attains the lower limit of its range .",
    "we indicate by means of a superscript on @xmath19 the nature of the appropriate modification .",
    "specifically , @xmath72 indicates the same quantity  ( [ generalr ] ) but with the understanding that when @xmath73 reaches its lower limit , we need to replace @xmath74    we now have all of the ingredients necessary to begin assembling the complete amplitude , which is given by the formula @xmath75 where @xmath76 is given by the sum over vertical paths in   beginning at the root node . to each such path",
    "we associate a nested sum of the product of the associated @xmath19-invariants in the vertices visited by the path .",
    "the last pair of labels in a given @xmath19 are those which are summed first , these are denoted by @xmath77 in row @xmath78 of the diagram .",
    "we always take the convention that @xmath79 and @xmath80 are separated by at least two ( @xmath81 ) which is necessary for the @xmath19-invariants to be well - defined .",
    "the lower and upper limits for the summation variables @xmath82 are indicated by the two numbers appearing adjacent to the line above each vertex .",
    "the differences between the new diagram and the one of  @xcite are :    1 .",
    "all pairs of labels in the vertices appear alphabetically in the form @xmath83 .",
    "the edges on the extreme left of the diagram are labeled by @xmath71 rather than @xmath84 , and the summation variables must be greater than or equal to these lower limits @xmath71 .",
    "the edges on the extreme right of the diagram are labelled by @xmath6 rather than @xmath14 , and the summation variables must be strictly less than this upper limit @xmath6 .",
    "all superscripts on @xmath19-invariants which detail boundary replacements are left superscripts ( i.e. for lower boundaries only ) . in a given cluster ,",
    "e.g. the cluster shown in  , the superscript associated to the left - most vertex is obtained from the sequence written in the vertex by deleting the final pair of labels and reversing the order of the last two labels which remain .",
    "thus the sequence ends @xmath85 for some @xmath86 .",
    "then proceeding to the right in the cluster , the next vertex has the same superscript , but with alphabetical order of the final pair , i.e. it ends @xmath83 .",
    "going further to the right in the cluster one obtains the relevant superscripts by sequentially deleting pairs of labels from the right .",

    "the iterative construction of any desired amplitude is no more difficult than the examples we have already studied in detail .",

    "although it is simple to describe the algorithm for a general amplitude in words and by appealing to the examples detailed above , we have not identified a pattern which would allow us to write down a general explicit formula , as was done for sym in  @xcite . as noted above each @xmath9 invariant comes with its own @xmath208-type factor , and each path in   which ends on a vertex with indices @xmath214 leads to an associated factor of the form @xmath215 where the general @xmath208 , @xmath209 and @xmath210 are suitably defined following the examples in the previous section .",

    "if we try the simplest guess which is that we should be able to associate these factors to the vertices in   such that every path ending on a given vertex picks up the factors associated to that vertex , then we find that :    1 .   for each cluster  ( see  )",

    "we emphasize that we have attempted here only to illustrate some features of the general structure ; in order to determine precisely the factors which appear for a given path it seems necessary to work out recursively which kinds of n@xmath219mhv@xmath151n@xmath220mhv factorizations that particular path corresponds to .",
