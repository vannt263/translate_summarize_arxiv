    "one of the main goal of modern cosmology is to determine the nature of the dark energy component that is sourcing the late time accelerated expansion of the universe .    since its discovery from measurements of luminosity distances of type ia supernovae in 1998  @xcite ,",
    "cosmic acceleration has been confirmed by several independent cosmological data . in particular measurements of the cosmic microwave background and galaxy distribution ,",
    "have not only confirmed its presence but also helped in clarifying its nature .",
    "constraints on the dark energy equation of state @xmath0 , that is the ratio between dark energy pressure and density , assumed as constant with redshift , have slightly improved over the last decade .",
    "for example , from the early analysis of @xcite where the constraint of @xmath4 at @xmath5 c.l . was reported , the very recent analysis of @xcite gives @xmath6 , at @xmath7 c.l .",
    ", i.e. an improvement of a factor @xmath8 in the constraint in about a decade of observations .",
    "these recent observations have provided decisive evidence against dark energy models with values of @xmath0 in the range @xmath9 as domain walls ( see e.g. @xcite ) or models based on extra dimensions ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "other models as `` geometric '' dark energy and `` thawing '' dark energy show , albeit not at a statistically significant level , a better agreement with observations ( see @xcite ) .    up to now , data are in good agreement with the standard cosmological model , where the acceleration is sourced by the cosmological constant @xmath10  @xcite , and therefore the equation of state is @xmath11 .",
    "however , recent experiments have reached a sensitivity that allows to test other characteristics of the dark energy equation of state and not only its value at very recent times .",
    "it is indeed possible to reconstruct the redshift dependence of @xmath0 , a key feature to distinguish between the cosmological constant , which predicts a constant @xmath0 , and alternative models which generally give an effecitve equation of state parameter that varies with redshift ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ in this paper we investigate the power of currently available cosmological data to constrain @xmath3 at different redshifts , adopting the principal component analysis already applied to the equation of state of dark energy in previous studies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : data ] we list the datasets used in our analysis , while in section  [ sec : method ] we describe the methodology .",
    "the results of our markov chain - monte carlo analysis are presented in section  [ sec : results ] while we draw our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we analyze a large sample of cosmological datasets . for the supernovae sn - ia luminosity distance",
    "we consider the union1 compilation  @xcite , union2  @xcite and snls  @xcite .",
    "we then combine them separately with the cmb observations coming from seven years of observations from the wmap satellite @xcite .    together with the wmap and snls we consider different datasets for baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) surveys combined in the following way :    * run1 + sdss - dr7 at z=0.20 , 0.35  @xcite in form of @xmath12 , wigglez at z=0.44 , 0.60 , 0.73  @xcite in form of @xmath13 ; * run2 + 6dfgrs at z=0.1  @xcite , wigglez at z=0.44 , 0.60 , 0.73  @xcite all in form @xmath12 ; * run3 + wigglez at z=0.44 , 0.60 , 0.73 all in form @xmath12 ; * run4 + 6dfgrs at z=0.1 , sdss - dr7 at z=0.20 , 0.35 , wigglez at z=0.44 , 0.60 , 0.73 all in form @xmath12 .",
    "in run1 we use as covariance matrix the one indicated in  @xcite for sdss - dr7 points and the one shown in  @xcite for wigglez points . in the other runs we use always the covariance matrix of  @xcite for sdss - dr7 where used , while for 6dfgrs and wigglez we use their parts of the covariance matrix from  @xcite .",
    "finally we add the most recent measurements for @xmath14 from the hubble space telescope  @xcite and the @xmath15 dataset from moresco et al .  @xcite .",
    "the analysis method we adopt is based on the publicly available monte carlo markov chain package ` cosmomc ` @xcite with a convergence diagnostic done through the gelman and rubin statistic .",
    "we sample the following six - dimensional standard set of cosmological parameters , adopting flat priors on them : the baryon and cold dark matter densities @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the hubble constant @xmath14 , the reionization optical depth @xmath18 , the scalar spectral index @xmath19 , and the overall normalization of the spectrum @xmath20 at @xmath21 .",
    "we consider purely adiabatic initial conditions and we impose spatial flatness .    the dark energy equation of state , as discussed above , is sampled in six redshift bins , @xmath22 , at six redshifts , @xmath23}$ ] equally spaced in @xmath24 . including more than six bins",
    "does not significantly improve the constraints .    in order to have @xmath3 as a smooth and continuous function , we interpolate between these values with a hyperbolic tangent function defined as :    @xmath25   \\\\",
    "w(z)=-1 & z\\geq z_6        \\end{array }        \\right.$ ] + where @xmath26 is an amplitude factor , @xmath27 is the half value of @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the half value of @xmath30 and @xmath31 is a smoothing parameter .",
    "the presence of dark energy perturbations has to be accounted for when the dark energy equation of state is constrained using cosmological probes that are sensitive to density perturbations .",
    "this is done by using a modified version of the publicly available code camb  @xcite , that evolves the dark energy perturbations also for values of @xmath2 , avoiding singularities by using the parametrized post - friedmann prescription for dark energy suggested by hu  @xcite .",
    "once the values of the parameters @xmath32 are determined , we must deal with the fact that they are correlated , which means that their covariance matrix is not diagonal . to obtain an uncorrelated estimation for their value we can make a rotation in the parameters space so to chose a different basis for the @xmath33",
    "in which their covariance matrix is diagonal .",
    "this can be done following the procedure suggested in  @xcite .",
    "using cosmomc we derive the covariance matrix , @xmath34 , and then we invert it to obtain the fisher matrix , which can be rewritten also as @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath36 is the diagonalized inverse covariance for the transformed bins .",
    "the vector of the uncorrelated parameters @xmath37 is obtained using the rows of the tranformation matrix as weights @xmath38 .",
    "we can now define @xmath39 so that @xmath40 , and , as pointed out by hamilton  @xcite , there are infinitely many choices for @xmath41 . following  @xcite we choose as weight matrix @xmath42 , where the rows are normalized to unity , and we apply it to obtain the uncorrelated parameters .    in other words we run cosmomc with the @xmath33 vector to obtain its covariance matrix .",
    "after that we derive @xmath37 , the principal components vector , by using the procedure explained before , and then run again the statistics to evaluate its marginalized values and errors . in figure [ pesifigu ]",
    "we show typical weights to obtain the @xmath37 from a linear combination of @xmath33 while in figure [ qlikfigu ] we show the likelihoods of the six principal components @xmath43 for a typical run . it can be noticed how , as expected , the lower redshift components are better constrained than the higher redshift ones .",
    "we first investigate the constraints on the dark energy equation of state combining wmap with different supernovae datasets and we report the results of this analysis in table [ sntable ] and figure [ snfigu ] .    as we can see , all the values for the @xmath43 are consistent with the cosmological constant case with @xmath44 in between two standard deviations . however , if we look at the value of @xmath45 , around @xmath46 , the snls survey appears as more compatible with @xmath11 than the union1 and union2 catalogs that are on the contrary providing slightly larger values of @xmath45",
    ". moreover the snls gives stronger constraints at lower redshifts respect to union1 and union2 while appears preferring a value of @xmath47 at @xmath48 whereas union1 and union2 are more compatible with a cosmological constant in this redshift range .",
    "if we look at the constraints on the other parameters in table [ sntable ] we also see that the three datasets provide slightly different values for the hubble constant @xmath14 : the snls survey indicates larger values , with @xmath49 , while the union2 and union1 catalogs prefers smaller values with @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively .",
    "all these values of @xmath14 are however well consistent in between two standard deviations .",
    "the value of the dark energy density appears also as larger in the snls survey respect to the value obtained from the union2 and union1 datasets , the latter providing the smallest value .",
    "since we are considering a flat universe this means that snls data is preferring a lower matter density respect to union2 and union1 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as we can see the effect of adding the hst prior or the @xmath15 dataset is to increase the value of the hubble parameter .",
    "however the hst prior is clearly in tension with the wmap+snls+bao dataset as showed by the increased value of the chi - square .",
    "both the hst prior and the @xmath15 dataset render the value of @xmath45 more compatible with predictions of a cosmological constant ( @xmath11 ) . in general , with the exception of the value of @xmath52 at @xmath53 that prefers values such that @xmath2 , there is a general agreement with a cosmological constant .      in order to better picture",
    "the impact of our analysis we compare the constraints on the equation of state obtained using wmap+snls+bao+@xmath15 reported in the previous section , with some representative dark energy and modified gravity models alternative to @xmath10cdm . + in fig.[confronto ] we show how our results on @xmath43 are in tension with the typical @xmath3 behaviour of models such as the hu - sawicki @xmath54 model ( hs ) @xcite , the covariant galileon model @xcite and tracking models @xcite .",
    "it is possible to notice how the tension is related to the low redshift bins ; in particular , we can see how both tracking and hs models predict a @xmath55 at low redshifts colliding with our results which slightly prefer @xmath2 ; the covariant galileon model instead does give @xmath2 however , while it can fit our first two redshift bins , it has tension with values in the higher redshift bins .",
    "+ we want to stress that in this paper we did not obtain constraints on these theories ; our purpose is to show how a detailed analysis of currently available datasets can in principle rule out models that are still considered viable . in particular , while we know that the covariant galileon model is already disfavoured by other observations @xcite , tracking models and hs modified gravity are still viable for some interval of the parameter space @xcite .",
    "however , they appear to be in tension with the combination of datasets considered in our analysis , motivating a detailed full analysis that will be the matter of an upcoming paper .",
    "dataset with several dark energy models as covariant galileon , hu - sawicki , tracking sugra and tracking power - law .",
    "most of these models are in tension with the data mostly because of the low redshift values of @xmath56 and @xmath52 that point to a cosmological constant or to @xmath57 .",
    "the tracking power law model reproduces the low redshift behaviour but is in disagreement with the constraints at higher redshifts.,width=377 ]",
    "in this paper we have presented updated constraints on the dark energy equation of state from a large collection of cosmological datasets .",
    "we have found that while for a wmap+snls case a cosmological constant is in very good agreement with the data , when also bao data are considered some indications are present for a time evolution of the dark energy equation of state . in particular the values around @xmath53",
    "prefer @xmath58 above one standard deviation .",
    "moreover , bao data , when analyzed in our extended parametrization of the dark energy component , prefer a low value for the hubble constant with @xmath59 in clear tension with the measured hst value of @xcite .    finally , we have compared our results with the theoretical predictions of dark energy and modified gravity models that predict a time varying equation of state , finding that several models do not reproduce the @xmath3 trend obtained with our analysis .",
    "this comparison suggests that the combination of datasets considered in our analysis can offer powerful constraints on alternatives to the cosmological standard model .",
    "we intend to perform a full analysis of the reduction of the allowed parameters space for the latter , when they are constrained directly , in an upcoming paper .",
