    "recently a giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) exceeding 200% was discovered by garca _ et al _ in ni - ni @xcite and co - co @xcite point contacts at room temperature .",
    "somewhat smaller ( @xmath1 ) but also very large magnetoresistance was observed in fe - fe point contacts .",
    "these experiments revealed large fluctuations in the measured values of the magnetoresistance drawn versus the conductance at ferromagnetic alignment of magnetizations in contacts , @xmath0 ( f - conductance ) . for ni - ni and co - co contacts ,",
    "the fluctuations are especially large at @xmath0 of the order of several elementary conductances @xmath2 , which may indicate that the effect observed is related to a conductance quantization .",
    "the quantization of the conductance in magnetic nanosize contacts has been observed experimentally in refs .",
    ". costa - krmer @xcite and oshima and miyano @xcite reported on an odd integer number @xmath3 of open conductance channels ( @xmath4 ) in nickel point contacts at room temperature .",
    "et al _ @xcite presented an evidence of changing the conductance quantum from @xmath5 to @xmath2 at room temperature in nickel nanocontacts of another morphology .",
    "et al _ @xcite and zvezdin and popkov @xcite have calculated the conductance of a point contact between two ferromagnets and demonstrated the @xmath2 conductance quantization due to a non - simultaneous opening of `` up '' and `` down '' spin - channels .",
    "et al _ @xcite also studied numerically the magnetoresistance as a function of f - conductance @xmath0 and came to the conclusion that , in the conductance quantization regime , the magnetoresistance oscillated as a function of the conductance .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the conductance and the magnetoresistance of nanosize magnetic contacts in the regime of conductance quantization .",
    "we found that , at low temperatures , the magnetoresistance is a multivalued function of the conductance at the parallel alignment of magnetizations , @xmath0 .",
    "in other words , in the regime of quantization , different samples , having the same f - conductance @xmath0 , may have different magnetoresistances .",
    "the distribution of the magnetoresistance is extremely broad for the first few open f - conductance channels .",
    "this leads us to the conclusion that large data fluctuations observed in the experiments by garca _",
    "et al _ @xcite may be a direct consequence of the conduction quantization .",
    "this means that the data fluctuations are inevitable for the magnetoresistance measurements in the nanosize magnetic contacts and this effect should not be treated as being due to experimental errors or a poor reproducibility of the measurements .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite we applied a quasiclassical ( qc ) method for calculations of the conductance of point contacts between ferromagnetic metals . we considered a model of two ferromagnetic , single domain half spaces contacting each other through a circular hole of a radius @xmath6 in an impenetrable membrane , separating the domains . at",
    "antiferromagnetically ( af ) aligned domains , a domain wall ( dw ) is created inside the constriction .",
    "we argued that the giant magnetoresistance values were determined by peculiarities of the carrier transmission through dw .    if the spin direction does not change when passing through dw , the carriers are strongly reflected by the interface . this effect can easily be understood because , in this situation , the electron moves effectively in a step - like potential",
    "of course , this reflection is large if the change of the magnetization in the constriction occurs at short distances .",
    "the above scenario may be realized provided the dw width is small , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the longitudinal relaxation rate time of the carriers magnetization , and @xmath10 is the zeeman precession frequency .",
    "@xcite in this limit , the carrier spin does not have enough time to follow the magnetization profile in dw .",
    "the strong reflection on dw leads to the magnetoresistance of the order of few hundred percents , if one uses reasonable values of spin polarizations of the conduction band estimated from the experimental data of refs . .",
    "in this paper , we use the model described above for the case when the conductance of the constriction is quantized . the connecting hole is assumed to have a cylindrical shape of arbitrary ( but shorter than the mean free path @xmath11 ) length @xmath12 . in the case of f - alignment of the magnetizations ,",
    "the carriers move effectively in a constant potential . for the af - aligned domains , the carriers move in a potential corresponding to the magnetization profile of the domain wall ( ref . ,",
    "2 ) . the hole connecting the two parts of the space plays the role of a filter selecting only those incidence angles that are allowed by the energy and momentum conservation . as the diameter of the hole",
    "is assumed to be very small , we may use the ballistic - limit versions of eqs .",

    "( [ eq24])-([eq30 ] ) .",
    "the conductance quantization is assumed to be due to the quantization of transversal motion in the constriction . in the ballistic regime ,",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) means that the summations should be done over the open conduction channels satisfying the condition : @xmath30    when the alignment of the magnetizations is ferromagnetic , the fermi momenta on both sides of the contact are equal to each other in the each spin channel . the energy and momentum conservation is already taken into account in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) ( both the ingoing and outgoing quasiparticles have the same fermi energy and the specular character of the scattering follows automatically ) .    at the antiferromagnetic alignment , the conservation of the momentum parallel to the interface ( @xmath31 , where the subscript 1 or 2 labels left- or right hand side of the contact , respectively ) introduces the _ additional _ selection rule into eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) : @xmath32 this selection rule strictly holds when the spin of the electron does not change during the electron flight through the dw .",
    "this situation is realized in the model of quantum dw @xcite and in the model of effectively abrupt dw .",
    "@xcite    the magnetoresistance is defined as follows @xcite @xmath33 the value of the magnetoresistance is sensitive to the profile of the dw and can become very large for sharp changes of the magnetization .",
    "we give an exact solution to a problem for the linear profile of magnetization in dw , which approximates well the behavior of magnetization in a narrow constriction.@xcite the limiting case of an infinitely steep slope corresponds effectively to the electron motion in a step - like potential , and gives the maximum possible magnetoresistance . in principle",
    ", the solution of the problem for other domain wall profiles can be found by perturbations to our exact solution .",

    "it allows us to make the following conclusions :    \\1 ) the f - alignment conductance is spin dependent and the spin channels open non - simultaneously ( see panel ( a ) ) , thus resulting in @xmath2 quantization of the conductance @xcite ;    \\2 ) finite magnetoresistance appears simultaneously with the first spin  down  and af - conductance ( panel ( b ) in correlation with panel(a ) ) ;    \\3 ) the magnetoresistance has quasi - periodic oscillations as a function of the hole radius ( panel ( b ) ) ;    \\4 ) sudden jumps in the magnetoresistance followed by practically flat plateaus appear at points where a new f - alignment spin `` up '' conductance channel opens up .",
    "they persist until the spin `` down '' projection opens a new channel ( panel ( b ) in correlation with panel ( a ) ) ;    \\5 ) when increasing the hole radius ( panel ( b ) ) or the number of open channels ( panels ( c ) and ( d ) ) , the amplitude of oscillations and of sub - steps of the magnetoresistance decreases and its asymptotic value ( panel ( d ) ) is given by our quasiclassical theory ; @xcite    \\6 ) the most intriguing finding is that the magnetoresistance versus the f - alignment conductance is a multivalued function of f - conductance , @xmath48 ( panels ( c ) and ( d ) ) .",

    "demonstrates that the magnetoresistance has the sharp peak when the first conduction channel opens up for the spin `` down '' electrons at f - alignment .",
    "if the spin polarization of conduction band is such that the spin `` down '' conductance channel appears at the first spin `` up '' conductance plateau , the mr peak should appear at the conductance corresponding to @xmath49 open channels of f - conductance , @xmath50 .",
    "this is displayed in our fig.1 , and the experimental results by garca _",
    "@xcite for ni - ni and fe - fe point contacts clearly demonstrate the same tendency .",
    "the result 3 ) indicates , that consecutive maxima in magnetoresistance as a function of the contact radius correspond to opening of the af - conductance channels .    the result 4 )",
    "leads to a weakly disperse or even non - disperse behavior of magnetoresistance at certain numbers of open f - alignment channels : @xmath51 .",
    "the non - disperse behavior of mr is due to the fact that the af - conductance is practically independent of the contact radius when a new f - conductance channel opens up ( see panel ( b ) ) .    the result 5 )",
    "shows that if conductance exceeds the value 10 - 15 ( in the @xmath2 units ) , which corresponds to the values of 8 - 10  for the hole radius , the magnetoresistance fluctuations become relatively small and its mean value converges well to that obtained in the ballistic quasi - classical regime.@xcite    the result 6 ) is crucial for the interpretation of the experimental data .",
    "the panel ( b ) shows a very sharp peak between @xmath52  and @xmath53  .",
    "the decay of the peak persists until a new spin `` down '' conduction channel opens at the f - alignment .",
    "if we draw the peak magnetoresistance versus the number @xmath54  of open channels ( panels ( c ) and ( d ) ) we see that all the points correspond to the single abscissa , @xmath55 this means that the magnetoresistance is a _ multivalued _ function of the number of open conduction channels at the f - alignment , provided the temperature effects and quenched disorder may be neglected .",
    "the magnetoresistance does not oscillate as a function of the conductance @xmath0 , but there are distributions of mr at fixed values of the f - alignment conductance , @xmath0 .",
    "the origin of these distributions is clarified by inspection of the panel ( b ) of fig.1 and its comparison with the panel ( a ) : in spite of the fact that the actual radius may vary in the range @xmath56  ,  it gives identical values of the f - conductance , which are due to the quantization . at the same time",
    ", the af - conductance depends on the radius ( area ) of the connecting channel , and this results in the different values of magnetoresistance .",
    "the multivalued magnetoresistance as a function of @xmath0 we predict is simply a consequence of the conductance quantization .",
    "this property survives for every reasonable shape of the nanocontact , provided that conductance at the ferromagnetic alignment of magnetizations is quantized ( conductance steps exist ) , and the domain wall in the constriction is effectively sharp .",
    "the multivalued behavior leads to extremely large fluctuations in the measured magnetoresistance data at the same f - conductance values .",
    "the density of points is considerably larger at small values of the magnetoresistance , than at larger ones . as a consequence of the decreasing density of the points , large values of the magnetoresistance",
    "are much less probable than the small ones .",
    "when observed experimentally , such a mr distribution should not be interpreted as being due to a poor reliability and reproducibility of experimental data .",
    "the giant data fluctuations are inevitable in the magnetoresistance measurements on the quantum magnetic contacts .",
    "increasing the spin polarization of the conduction band ( decreasing the parameter @xmath57 ) we see from our model that opening of the spin `` down '' conductance channel moves towards the second step in f - conductance .",
    "then , weakly disperse mr distributions , which originate from the flat magnetoresistance graph sections ( panels(b ) of figs . 1 and 2 )",
    ", become strongly disperse moving closer to the steps of the spin `` down '' f - conductance .",
    "fig.2 is drawn using the parameter @xmath58 , so that the spin `` down '' conductance appears now at the second plateau of the spin `` up '' conductance at f - alignment ( panel ( a ) ) . obviously , the mr points appear now at @xmath59 open conductance channels of f - alignment .",
    "the figure reveals the seventh finding : the minimal number of open channels @xmath54  at which the magnetoresistance points appear allows us to estimate the lower bound for the conduction band spin polarization parameter @xmath57 .",
    "a further increase of the conduction band polarization leads to the following interesting behavior : a ) mr points appear at @xmath60 and larger numbers of the open f - conductance channels ; b ) the theory predicts a huge enhancement of mr at high conduction band polarizations ( small @xmath57 ) . from our calculations",
    "we conclude that if nanosize point contacts made of highly spin polarized metals ( @xmath61 : nimnsb , lmso , cro@xmath62 @xcite ) with the f - conductance in the range of 5 - 10 channels were available experimentally , they would show mr of 1000% and higher .    our calculations , panels ( c ) of figs . 1 and 2 ,",
    "show that the finite length of the constriction does not influence qualitatively the results , which can be deduced from the calculations for the step - like potential barrier corresponding to dw .",
    "all above conclusions hold , but the magnitude and the overall width of mr distributions decrease as compared to the results of calculations for the model of the step - like potential describing dw in the constriction ( panels ( d ) of figs . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "our calculations show that , in the quantized conductance regime , the minimal number of open f - conductance channels , at which the values of the magnetoresistance appear , is determined by the conduction band polarization @xmath57 . in fig .",
    "1 the ap - alignment conductance channel opens up at the first plateau of the spin `` up '' conductance .",
    "corresponding magnetoresistance points appear at @xmath49 open f - conductance channels .",
    "our analysis shows that the threshold of the magnetoresistance rise moves from @xmath49 to @xmath59 open f - conductance channels at @xmath63 .",
    "the experiments by garca _",
    "et al _ on ni - ni contacts ( fig .",
    "2b of ref . ,",
    "1a of ref . and fig . 2 of ref",
    ". ) and on fe - fe contacts ( fig .",
    "1a of ref . )",
    "clearly indicate that the mr points appear close to @xmath49 for the both materials .",
    "this means that @xmath57 for both ni and fe is _ larger _ than 0.63 for our choice of the parameter @xmath64@xmath43 .",
    "in contrast , the experimental data for co - co contacts , fig .",
    "2a of ref . , and",
    "fig . 2 of ref . ,",
    "indicate that mr appears at @xmath65 open channels , that is at the second plateau of the spin `` up '' f - conductance ( see panels ( a , b ) of fig .",
    "this suggests that polarization of the conduction band in co is higher ( and @xmath57 is smaller ) as compared with ni and fe , and allows us to estimate the lower bound as @xmath66co@xmath67 .",
    "additional information can be extracted from the distributions of the mr points at small numbers of open f - conductance channels .",
    "we interpret these distributions as manifestation of the multivalued behavior of the magnetoresistance as a function of f - conductance . in fig .",
    "3 , the calculated values of mr are compared with the results of the experiments on ni and co point contacts .",
    "solid circles at every quantized value of the conductance show the range of the magnetoresistance distributions calculated at @xmath68 .",
    "in addition , some points close to the experimentally measured ones are shown inside the regions .",
    "the maximum theoretically available mr values for this length of the channel are @xmath69% for ni ( at @xmath49 ) and @xmath70% for co ( at @xmath59 ) .",
    "surprisingly , our simple model reproduces well the mr fluctuations and the extreme mr values at @xmath66ni@xmath71 and @xmath66co@xmath72 and small numbers of open conduction channels . a deviation of the calculated mr from the experimental ones at @xmath73 ( in @xmath2 units )",
    "may be referred to various reasons :    \\1 ) when the diameter of the constriction becomes large the domain wall is no longer effectively abrupt ( independent of the actual shape ) , and the magnetoresistance begins to drop very fast down to the values 2 - 11% given by the levy - zhang mechanism of scattering enhancement in the domain wall ; @xcite    \\2 ) one or several impurities or lattice defects may be located just at the constriction causing additional random deviations of conductance values from integer numbers of @xmath2  ( see , for example , refs . and references therein ) ;    \\3 ) the shape of the constriction may deviate substantially from the cylindrical one . according to calculations by torres et al @xcite for variable cross - section constrictions with the hyperbolic geometry ,",
    "the conductance quantization steps survive at the opening solid angles up to 90@xmath74 , at least for the small number of open conductance channels .",
    "this also leads to deviations of conductance values from integer numbers of @xmath2 ;    \\4 ) the non - cylindrical cross - section of the connecting channel ( it can be verified for the elliptic and rectangular cross - sections ) influences the quantization conditions and , hence , the sequence of openings of the spin channels .    the latter reason may change the assignment of some open conduction channels from the spin `` up '' quantization to the spin `` down '' one and _ vice versa_. it may influence the structure and the width of the mr distributions at fixed values of the f - conductance @xmath0 in fig . 3 , but does not destroy overall consistency of the theory with the experiment .",
    "thus , besides the conduction band polarization parameter @xmath57 , a contact size ,  a shape and a length of the channel determine the values of the magnetoresistance .",
    "the real nanocontacts by garca et al have been made by pressing a sharpened ferromagnetic tip into another piece of a ferromagnet .",
    "every mr point has been measured for a particular contact with individual shape , size and length of the constriction .",
    "that is why we believe that overall agreement of the theory with the experiment is fairly good .",
    "thus , our analysis of garca et al measurements @xcite suggests that the conduction band polarization parameters @xmath57 for different materials obey the following inequalities : @xmath66fe@xmath75ni@xmath76co@xmath77 this means that cobalt has the most polarized conduction band . on the other hand",
    ", one can extract the information about the spin polarization of a ferromagnet s conduction band from the ferromagnet - insulator - superconductor ( fis ) tunneling spectroscopy and the f - s andreev reflection spectroscopy .",
    "the fis tunneling data @xcite provide the following estimates for the mean values of the conduction band polarization parameter @xmath57 : 0.63 for ni ; 0.48 for co and 0.43 for fe .",
    "the andreev reflection spectroscopy @xcite gives the mean values of @xmath57 : 0.62 for ni ; 0.64 for co ; 0.62 for fe - from ref . ; 0.72 for ni and 0.68 for co - from ref . ; 0.6 for ni and 0.62 for fe - from ref . .",
    "so , our estimated values for @xmath57 , @xmath66ni@xmath71 for ni and @xmath66co@xmath78 for co , are rather close to those obtained from the tunnel and andreev spectroscopies . at the same time , these spectroscopies indicate that iron probably has the highest polarization of the conduction band .",
    "this does not agree with the conclusions obtained from measurements of the magnetic point contact magnetoresistance .",
    "of course , complex band structures of the contacting metals in the andreev and the point contact measurements may affect the values of the conduction band spin polarization obtained from these experiments .",
    "however , we would like to stress here that this discrepancy may also be due to the character of the electron transmission through the contact . in the point contact of two ferromagnetic metals ,",
    "an electron traverses the domain wall at the af alignment of magnetizations , which contrasts the tunneling in the tunnel and andreev spectroscopies .",
    "we believe , that regime of the spin conservation during the flight through the constriction could not been satisfied in fe .",
    "then , the effective domain width is large , @xmath79fe@xmath80fe@xmath81 , and the electron spin partially follows the domain wall profile .",
    "this results in the appearance of the af - conductance and magnetoresistance at smaller numbers of open f - conductance channels ( @xmath49 ) , rather than at @xmath59 or @xmath82 as one might expect from our theory",
    ". this may be also the reason why the magnitude of magnetoresistance is reduced in iron to @xmath83 .",
    "let us say few words about influence of a disorder in the area of the contact and of temperature effects on the magnetoresistance .",
    "strong disorder should be avoided in experiments , because it destroys quantization ( see , for example , ref . and citations therein ) , and hence the huge enhancement of magnetoresistance that we predict .",
    "one may estimate from ref .",
    "that typical range for fluctuations of the disorder potential energy should be below 10% of the fermi energy .",
    "the experiments by garca et al have been made on pure metals at room temperature , so we do not expect any effects that would result in the weak localization.@xcite if there is a single impurity just in the constriction , the transmission coefficient changes @xcite , and this leads to deviations of the f - conduction values from the integer numbers of @xmath2 .",
    "however , provided the condition @xmath84 is fulfilled , where @xmath85 is the impurity potential , the effect of the impurity scattering on the conductance is small , and our analysis for the ballistic transmission should be qualitatively valid .",
    "we expect that temperature effects are relatively small if the temperature does not exceed the fermi energy @xmath86 and the curie temperature @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "moreover , phonon and magnon assisted relaxation processes are quenched because of a large , @xmath89 @xmath90 , exchange splitting of the conduction band . the experimental observation of sharp conduction",
    "quantization steps in the nickel nanosize contacts at room temperature @xcite confirms the above expectation .    from the above analysis",
    "we conclude that our theory is consistent with the experimental data.@xcite therefore , it is reasonable to think that the origin of large fluctuations of the magnetoresistance as a function of conductance @xmath0 at the ferromagnetic alignment is the quantization of conductance , but not measurement errors or poor reproducibility of the results .",
    "the smallest number of open f - conductance channels , at which the magnetoresistance data appear , allowed us to estimate the low bound of the spin polarization of the conduction band of a ferromagnet . for a more detailed comparison of our theory with experiments more experimental data points for the magnetoresistance , as well as",
    "more experimentally determined or controlled parameters like @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 , and more information about the shape of the constriction are needed .",
    "besides the experiments by garca et al , our theory has obvious implications to future experiments with a nanocontact between two ferromagnetic islands made of a short nanowire .",

    "formally , the magnetoresistance defined by eq . ( 6 ) may diverge if the af conductance @xmath39 approaches zero , which would mean that the nanocontact with one open channel of the f - conductance serves as an ideal quantum spin - valve . however , this might be possible only if the spin of conduction electrons conserves when the electrons traverse the domain wall .",
