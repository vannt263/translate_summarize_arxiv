    "oscillation frequencies are the primary data used in seismic modelling . if oscillation spectra are rich and some regularities can be identified , then a substantial amount of information can be extracted about stellar interior and physics .",
    "this is the case for the sun , solar - like stars and some white dwarfs , for which equidistances in frequencies or periods are observed .    in recent years , we have entered the age of studying pulsating variables from space , by missions such as most , corot , kelper , which are delivering great and interesting results . but",
    "despite the tremendous number of detected pulsational frequencies , there is no main sequence pulsator showing regular structures in its oscillation spectrum .",
    "the best example is a @xmath2 scuti star , hd50844 , for which at least 1000 frequencies were detected from the corot photometry and no clear regularity in frequency spacing is seen ( poretti et al .",
    "moreover , all satellite missions observe in one wide photometric passband , therefore nothing can be said about mode identification and a support from ground - based observations is unavoidable .",
    "a hope for asterseismology of main - sequence stars can be put in the forthcoming brite mission which will make a two - passband photometry supported by ground - based spectroscopy .",
    "therefore , for the time being , an improvement in seismic modelling of main - sequence pulsators can be rather achieved by incorporating other seismic tools related to each mode frequency .",
    "one of such tools is the relative amplitude of radiative flux perturbation at the level of the photosphere , which is called the @xmath1-parameter . because of the non - adiabaticity of pulsation this quantity is complex .",
    "the @xmath1-parameter is determined in subphotospheric layers , mainly in the pulsation driving region , whereas oscillation frequencies are defined mainly by the stellar interior . therefore these two seismic probes are complementary to each other and fitting them simultaneously , which we called _ complex asteroseismology _ ( daszyska - daszkiewicz & walczak 2009 , hereafter ddw09 ) , can bring much stronger constraints on parameters of the model and theory .",
    "theoretical values of @xmath1 are obtained in the framework of linear nonadiabatic computations of stellar pulsation and their empirical counterparts are derived from multicolour time series photometry .",
    "asteroseismic potential of the @xmath1-parameter has been already proven for some @xmath2 scuti stars ( daszyska - daszkiewicz , dziembowski , pamyatnykh , 2003 , daszyska - daszkiewicz et al .",
    "2005a ) and @xmath3 cephei stars ( daszyska - daszkiewicz , dziembowski , pamyatnykh 2005 , hereafter , dd05 ) . in the case of @xmath2 scuti stars",
    ", the @xmath1-parameter appeared to be strongly dependent on the treatment of subphotospheric convection . for the b - type pulsators ,",
    "a strong sensitivity to the metal content and the opacities has been found .",
    "thus , a comparison of empirical and theoretical values of @xmath1 can yield information on the convective transport in the cooler pulsators and on opacities in the hotter ones .    in the present paper ,",
    "we make one more attempt towards seismic modelling of @xmath0 eridani , which is a b - type hybrid pulsator , i.e. , one showing both @xmath3 cephei type pulsations and frequencies typical for slowly pulsating b - type ( spb ) stars . in our study",
    "we aim at parallel fitting of pulsation frequencies and the corresponding values of the complex , nonadiabatic parameter @xmath1 , taking into account instability conditions .",
    "such studies have been done recently by us for the @xmath3 cep star @xmath4 ophiuchi ( ddw09 ) . from fitting two centroid frequencies of @xmath4 oph and the @xmath1-parameter of the radial mode ,",
    "we have found a strong preference for the opal opacity tables . in the case of @xmath0 eri",
    ", we have more useable frequencies , so that stronger constraints can be expected .",
    "our main seismic modelling is based on fitting three p - mode frequencies .",
    "then , we single out models which fit the forth p - mode frequency and two low frequencies corresponding to high - order g modes .",
    "moreover , empirical values of @xmath1 can be determined in a wide range of frequencies , i.e. , from about 0.6 to 8 c / d .",
    "another important result of the presented paper is identification of the mode degree , @xmath5 , for all frequencies detected in the recent photometric multi - site campaign ( jerzykiewicz et al .",
    "2005 , hereafter j05 ) using two methods .",
    "in section 2 , we give a brief review of @xmath0 eridani .",
    "section 3 is devoted to identifying of the spherical harmonic degree , @xmath5 , for all fourteen modes using two approaches .",
    "a discussion of empirical values of the intrinsic mode - amplitude is also included . in section 4 ,",
    "we present results of our seismic modelling of @xmath0 eri from fitting pulsational frequencies and then from reconciling corresponding values of the complex , nonadiabatic parameter @xmath1 .",
    "conclusions end the paper .",
    "@xmath0 eridani ( hd 29248 , @xmath6 mag ) is the most extensively studied main - sequence pulsator of early b spectral type ( b2iii ) .",
    "the star is a slow rotator , with the velocity of rotation of about 6 km / s derived from the rotational splitting of pulsational frequencies ( pamyatnykh , handler & dziembowski , 2004 ) . during the last few years",
    ", this variable has attracted much interest thanks to dedicated photometric ( handler et al .",
    "2004 , j05 ) and spectroscopic ( aerts et al . 2004 ) multisite campaigns .",
    "these observations allowed to detect new frequencies typical for @xmath3 cep stars as well as entirely new two peaks in the spb frequency domain .",
    "the frequency analysis revealed 14 pulsational frequencies in photometry ( handler et al .",
    "2004 , j05 ) , while 9 of them , including one spb frequency , were identified also in spectroscopy ( aerts et al .",
    "2004 ) . as a result ,",
    "@xmath0 eridani has became one of the most multiperiodic b - type main - sequence pulsator and the updated oscillation spectrum ( shown in fig.1 ) required to reclassify it from the @xmath3 cep to @xmath3 cep / spb type .",
    "recently , another @xmath3 cep / spb star rivals it in the number of pulsation frequencies . from an analysis of most photometry of @xmath7 peg , handler et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found 14 independent peaks : 8 of the @xmath3 cep type and 6 of the spb type .",
    "mode identification of the @xmath0 eri frequencies from photometric and spectroscopic observations ( ridder at el .",
    "2004 ) and from inspection of the oscillation spectrum ( j05 ) showed the well known radial , fundamental mode and three @xmath8 dipole modes , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with all components .",
    "identification of the remaining modes , including two spb frequencies , was not successful or has not been made .",
    "subsequently , several papers were devoted to seismic analysis of @xmath0 eri .",
    "pamyatnykh , handler & dziembowski ( 2004 ) encountered a problem with excitation of the high - order g mode , @xmath11 c / d , as well as the high - frequency p modes with @xmath12 c / d .",
    "as a solution , these authors proposed increasing the iron abundance in the driving region ; this excited the high frequency modes but not the g mode . from an analysis of the rotational splitting of two dipole modes , they deduced that rotation of @xmath0 eri is not uniform , with its rate in the @xmath13-gradient zone about three times faster than in the outer layers .",
    "pamyatnykh , handler & dziembowski ( 2004 ) managed to find models which reproduced the three centroid frequencies corresponding to the @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 modes but did not succeed in fitting the highest centroid frequency , a component of the @xmath17 triplet .",
    "this was done by ausseloos et al .",
    "( 2004 ) but for higher values of the overshooting parameter , @xmath18 , effective temperatures much lower than @xmath19 of the observational value or non - standard chemical composition .",
    "moreover , the problem with the @xmath17 mode excitation for models with a standard chemical composition remained .",
    "both papers relied on one source of opacity data , opal , and on the old solar chemical composition ( grevesse & noels , 1993 ) .     eridani .",
    "fourteen frequencies were detected from photometry and nine of them were found also in spectroscopic variations , marked as red peaks .",
    "the frequency region @xmath20 c / d , in which no frequencies were detected , is not shown.,width=321 ]        dd05 undertook the first attempt to fit also the @xmath1-parameter for the radial mode using both opal and op tables .",
    "they showed that , in the case of b - type pulsators , @xmath1 strongly depends on metallicity and the adopted opacity data .",
    "a comparison of empirical values of @xmath1 with theoretical ones corresponding to four seismic models with @xmath21 and 0.1 showed that no agreement is possible regardless of which opacity tables are used .",
    "more recently , seismic studies were done by dziembowski & pamyatnykh ( 2008 ) , these authors used opal and op data and included a new solar composition ( asplund et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter a04 ) . in that paper ,",
    "dziembowski & pamyatnykh ( 2008 ) abandoned the idea of iron accumulation in the @xmath22bump zone to explain the g mode excitation , because there is no evidence of an abundance anomaly in the atmosphere of @xmath0 eri .",
    "effects of differential rotation in the analysis of three @xmath8 triplets of @xmath0 eri were included by suarez et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "detection of high - order g - mode pulsation in massive stars ( @xmath23 ) creates new challenges and opportunities for theory of stellar pulsation .",
    "firstly , a problem of mode excitation in this frequency range for massive models should be solved .",
    "this can be achieved by improving opacity computations and more precise seismic modelling which should include , e.g. , chemical composition of a given star .",
    "secondly , multi - colour photometric data on modes allow to determine empirical values of @xmath1 in a wide frequency range and to compare them with theoretical counterparts .",
    "this can provide unique constraints because a dependence of the @xmath1-parameter on the mode frequency and degree , @xmath5 , is very different for p and g modes .",
    "although several years have elapsed since the second photometric campaign of @xmath0 eridani ( j05 ) , mode identification employing photometric observables for all 14 detected pulsational peaks has never been undertaken .",
    "the @xmath24 strmgran photometry and radial velocity measurements allowed us to apply two approaches to identify the degree @xmath5 of the pulsational modes . in the first case",
    ", we compare observational values of the amplitude ratios and phase differences between available passpands with their theoretical counterparts and rely on theoretical values of the @xmath1-parameter which result from linear nonadiabatic computations of stellar oscillations ( cugier , dziembowski & pamyatnykh , 1994 ) . in the second method",
    "we make use of the amplitudes and phases themselves and a value of @xmath1 is determined in the least square process together with @xmath5 . for a detailed description of this method see daszyska - daszkiewicz , dziembowski & pamyatnykh ( 2003 ) and dd05 . in the case of b - type pulsators , the second method demands radial velocity measurements to get a unique identification of the degree @xmath5 . as for input from stellar atmospheres",
    ", we use kurucz ( 2004 ) models and claret s limb darkening coefficients ( claret 2000 ) . both methods provide a discriminant as a function of @xmath5 , which we named @xmath25 or @xmath26 , according to whether theoretical or empirical values of @xmath1 were used . for definitions see ddw09 .        in this paper , we assume observational values of the effective temperature and luminosity derived by dd05 , i.e. @xmath27 to determine the values of @xmath28 for the fourteen frequencies detected in photometric variations of @xmath0 eri , we used models with various masses , luminosities , effective temperatures and metallicites within the error box , assuming the a04 chemical mixture .",
    "as an example , in fig.2 we plot @xmath28 as a function of the mode degree , @xmath5 , determined for four models with the same mass , @xmath29 , but with two values of metallicity , @xmath30 and 0.015 , two opacity tables , opal and op , and two values of the microturbulent velocity in the atmosphere , @xmath31 and 8 km / s .",
    "it is well established that the dominant frequency , @xmath32 , is the radial fundamental mode .",
    "the three dipole modes with all components , ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) , ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) and ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) , were identified in earlier papers either from photometric observables ( ridder et al .",
    "2004 ) or from the oscillation spectrum itself ( j05 ) .",
    "as one can see from fig.2 , these identifications are confirmed by the method of amplitude ratios and phase differences .",
    "identification of the degree @xmath5 for @xmath42 , @xmath43 and for two spb modes , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , is as follows . for @xmath46 c / d",
    ", @xmath25 reaches low values at all @xmath5 , except @xmath47 , but there is some indication that @xmath48 .",
    "a similar result is obtained for @xmath49 c / d , but here @xmath28 has a minimum at @xmath50 .",
    "we have to add in advance that whereas @xmath42 matches @xmath48 in seismic pulsational models , the frequency @xmath43 can be associated only with @xmath51 .",
    "the same identifications for these two frequencies were proposed by dziembowski & pamyatnykh ( 2008 ) .",
    "luckily , an unambiguous identification of @xmath5 was possible for the high - order g modes : @xmath52 c / d is an @xmath8 mode , whereas @xmath53 c / d is an @xmath48 mode . for the latter ,",
    "there is some probability of @xmath51 , but it is much smaller because visibility of this mode is much worse .",
    "now , let us discuss in more detail the values of @xmath28 for @xmath32 , the radial mode .",
    "firstly , these values are much higher than 1 whichever model is considered .",
    "this is because formal errors of the photometric amplitudes and phases are underestimated ( j05 ) ; this problem has been already discussed by dd05 .",
    "another , more relevant feature is that a value of @xmath54 decreases about twofold if the microturbulent velocity of 8 km / s is adopted instead of 2 km / s , with other parameters fixed .",
    "this result agrees with determination of @xmath55 in the atmosphere of @xmath0 eri by gies & lambert ( 1992 ) who obtained @xmath56 within the lte approximation .",
    "the second method of mode identification can be applied for nine frequencies , including one spb freqyency , which were found in multicolour photometry and in spectroscopy . from line",
    "profile variations we derived the values of radial velocity , defined as the first moment of the siiii4553 spectral line . in fig.3 , we show the @xmath26 dependence on @xmath5 for five models : for the centre and the four edges of the error box ( eq .",
    "the @xmath5 identifications for first seven frequencies , @xmath57 , and the twelfth , @xmath38 , agree with the previous ones .",
    "now , let us deal with the low frequency mode , @xmath53 c / d .",
    "as can be seen from fig.3 , the discriminant @xmath26 reaches a minimum for @xmath48 and @xmath58 .",
    "this approach excludes @xmath51 , whereas the first method excluded @xmath58 .",
    "moreover , these higher @xmath5 modes suffer from strong disc - averaging effects .",
    "thus , we regard the @xmath48 identification as most probable . a summary of our identifications of @xmath5 by the two methods for all 14 pulsational frequencies of @xmath0 eri is given in tab.1 .",
    ".most probable identification of the @xmath5 degree for the pulsational frequencies of @xmath0 eri from two approaches . [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     [ char_models ]    , plotted against the mode frequency with degrees @xmath59 .",
    "two seismic models with about the same effective temperature were considered : op1 and opal2 ( cf .",
    ", width=321 ]    the radial orders for the spb modes , estimated from our seismic models , are @xmath60 for @xmath52 c / d and @xmath61 for @xmath53 c / d .",
    "let us assume that these modes are axisymmetric @xmath62 and check whether there is a seismic model amongst those presented in fig.4 which reproduces also these high - order g modes . in fig.5 , we show the frequency values of these orders for the op seismic models as a function of the overshooting parameter @xmath63 .",
    "in the top and bottom panel we plot frequencies around @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "we can see that in each case there are two seismic models which reproduce these high - order g modes .",
    "the accuracy of these fits amounts to @xmath64 c / d .",
    "the corresponding radial orders for @xmath44 are @xmath65 and @xmath66 at @xmath67 and 0.42 , respectively . in the case of @xmath45 , we get @xmath68 and @xmath69 at @xmath67 and 0.39 , respectively .",
    "we can see that the op seismic model with @xmath67 fits simultaneously @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the next coincidence is that this is the model close to the op2 model ( see tab.3 ) which fits also the forth pressure mode , @xmath70 .",
    "a similar result has been obtained for the opal seismic models and with about the same values of @xmath63 , but none of them coincides with the opal3 model which fits @xmath70 .",
    "now , let us come back to the instability of the modes . in fig.6 we plot the normalized instability parameter , @xmath71 , as a function of frequency for two seismic models with about the same effective temperature but differing in all other parameters and the opacity data ( models op1 and opal2 in tab.3 ) .",
    "these seismic models are marked with star symbols in fig.4 .",
    "let us remaind the reader that a mode is unstable if @xmath72 .",
    "as we can see , the op seismic models are more unstable ; this results mainly from higher metallicity for the op1 model ( @xmath73 ) . in general , at the same @xmath74 , pulsation computations with the op tables give more instability for low frequency modes ( the spb modes ) whereas with the opal data we get a wider instability in the high frequency range ( the @xmath3 cep modes ) .",
    "this is because the @xmath22bump in the op tables is located in deeper layers where the thermal time scale is longer .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the three highest amplitude centroid frequencies ( @xmath75 ) are excited in most seismic models ( to the left of the vertical thick line in the left panel of fig.4 ) . in all our seismic models",
    "the frequency @xmath40 , corresponding to the @xmath76 mode , is stable .",
    "the highest values of @xmath71 for this mode are @xmath77 in the op models and @xmath78 in the opal models . as for the high - order g modes ,",
    "the frequency @xmath44 , identified as the @xmath8 mode , is stable in all seismic models , but @xmath45 , which is an @xmath79 mode , reaches instability very often .",
    "empirical values of @xmath1 were obtained from the method of simultaneous determination of @xmath1 and @xmath5 ( cf .",
    "sect.3 ) .        in fig.7",
    "we compare the empirical and theoretical values of @xmath1 for all nine frequencies of @xmath0 eri found in both photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "theoretical values of @xmath1 corresponding to the op1 and opal2 seismic models in tab.3 ( marked also with star symbols in fig.4 ) are plotted as solid and dotted lines , respectively .",
    "modes with the spherical harmonic degrees from @xmath47 to 4 were considered .",
    "as one can see , there is quite a good agreement for the most pulsational frequencies including the spb - type mode , @xmath53 c / d , which was identified as @xmath48 .",
    "unfortunately , the frequency @xmath52 c / d is not visible in spectroscopy . around @xmath80",
    "c / d we have four points which overlap , because frequencies @xmath32 and @xmath81 are very close to each other . the discrepancy for the remaining frequencies is caused by inadequate accuracy of the photometric amplitudes and phases in the case of the low - amplitude modes , e.g. , @xmath38 .",
    "having empirical values of @xmath1 in such a wide range of frequency is a big advantage . particularly because the dependence of @xmath1 on pulsational frequency and the mode degree , @xmath5 , is different for p and g modes . in general , the @xmath1-parameter is determined by pulsational frequency and the shape of eigenfunction as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the dimensionless frequency , @xmath84 is the angular frequency , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 have their usual meaning .",
    "thus , for p modes the second term dominates and @xmath1 is independent of @xmath5 . if frequencies are low ( g modes ) , the first term dominates and we have a strong dependence of the @xmath1-parameter on @xmath5 .",
    "this is clearly visible in fig.7 .",
    "we can see also that while values of @xmath1 for the p modes change rather slowly with frequency , a rapid variation of @xmath1 occurs for the g modes .",
    "the best accuracy of the values of @xmath1 was obtained for the radial mode and the three @xmath87 modes .",
    "their frequencies are very close to each other and so are their @xmath1-parameters ( cf .",
    "tab.2 ) . therefore",
    ", further consideration will concern the @xmath1-parameter of the radial mode , @xmath32 .",
    "in fig.8 we show a comparison of the empirical and theoretical values of @xmath1 of the op and opal seismic models .",
    "we consider models with effective temperatures within @xmath19 of the observational value .",
    "as can be seen from fig.8 , only with the opal tables we can get an agreement of the @xmath1-values within the errors and this is achieved for lower values of @xmath88 and lower metallicity .",
    "the same result was obtained for the @xmath3 cep star @xmath4 oph ( ddw09 ) .",
    "the opal model which fits four @xmath0 eri frequencies has the @xmath1-parameter marginally consistent with our empirical determination ( the big dot ) .",
    "we do not know whether this result is a stroke of good luck or has some physical meaning .",
    "the effect of the microturbulent velocity in the atmosphere , @xmath55 , on the values of @xmath1 is negligible ( cf .",
    "we did not examine the effect of the hydrogen abundance , @xmath89 , because , as has been shown by ddw09 , in the case of early b - type pulsators , the @xmath1-parameter is only weakly sensitive to @xmath89 .     for the radial mode , @xmath90 , with theoretical ones corresponding to the op and opal seismic models of @xmath0 eri.,width=325 ]     for the g , @xmath48 mode , @xmath45 , with theoretical ones corresponding to the op and opal seismic models of @xmath0 eri .",
    "the same radial orders , @xmath91 , as in fig.5 were considered .",
    "circles mark models which fit the frequency @xmath45 .",
    "two op models with the radial order @xmath69 are outside the @xmath19 error of the effective temperature , marked with asterisks.,width=317 ]    as we have mentioned above , it would be of particular interest to compare the theoretical and empirical values of @xmath1 also for the high - order g modes . here",
    "we can do this for the frequency @xmath45 which was detected in both photometry and spectroscopy . in fig.9",
    ", we show such a comparison using the same seismic models as those in fig.8 . with circles we marked models fitting the frequency @xmath45 and with asterisks , three op models with the radial order @xmath69 which are outside the @xmath19 error of the effective temperature .",
    "the result is quite intriguing . while in the case of the @xmath3 cep mode the empirical values of @xmath1 agree with the opal computations , for the spb mode , @xmath45 , an agreement for both real and imaginary part of @xmath1 can be achieved with the op data .",
    "moreover , one can notice that in the case of both , the p modes and the high - order g mode , theoretical values of @xmath1 of the opal and op models agree better in the real parts than in the imaginary ones .",
    "here , we have to discuss also a possibility that the frequency @xmath45 is a non - axisymmetric mode . as we mentioned in sect .",
    "2 , the rotational velocity of @xmath0 eri is very slow and the effect of the azimuthal order , @xmath92 , on @xmath1 can be entirely neglected . as for the frequency dependence of @xmath1",
    "our justification is as follows . taking the stellar radius of @xmath93 ,",
    "the rotational frequency is @xmath94 c / d .",
    "given the high - order g modes , the ledoux constant can be approximated by @xmath95 .",
    "thus for @xmath48 we get the rotational splitting of @xmath96 c / d .",
    "in so narrow frequency range , i.e. , @xmath97 c / d , both the real and imaginary parts of @xmath1 are nearly constant .",
    "therefore , although the assumption that @xmath45 is the @xmath98 mode can be invalid , it does not change above results .",
    "we presented comprehensive asteroseimic modelling of the @xmath3 cep / spb star @xmath0 eridani .",
    "we started from mode identification for all fourteen pulsation frequencies detected in the light variations from the last photometric campaign ( j05 ) . for nine frequencies ,",
    "seen also in the radial velocity variation , we were able to apply the method of simultaneous determination of the degree @xmath5 and the nonadiabatic parameter @xmath1 ( dd05 ) .",
    "we confirmed identifications of @xmath5 from previous determinations .",
    "moreover , mode degrees of the spb frequencies were unambiguously determined .",
    "we got @xmath8 for @xmath52 c / d and @xmath48 for @xmath53 c / d .    in the next step",
    ", we looked for stellar models which fit the three centroid frequencies : @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 . using opacities from the op and opal tables and the a04 chemical mixture",
    ", we found a family of seismic models with different masses , effective temperatures , metallicities and core overshooting parameters .",
    "the opal seismic models agreed better with observational values of the effective temperature , @xmath102 , and luminosity , @xmath103 . with two opacity data",
    ", we managed to find also models which fit the fourth centroid frequency , @xmath104 , but with worse accuracy in comparison with the first three ones ; these models have effective temperatures about @xmath105 cooler than the observational value .    moreover , it turned out that some of our seismic models reproduce simultaneously also the high - order gravity modes , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "this was the case for models with the overshooting parameter , @xmath63 , of about 0.2 and 0.4 , independently of which opacity data were used",
    ". additionally , the op seismic model with @xmath106 is close to the one which fits also the fourth p mode , @xmath40 .",
    "then we extended our seismic analysis by adding the requirement of fitting the @xmath1-parameter .",
    "a comparison of the empirical and theoretical values of @xmath1 for nine frequencies , which appeared in both photometry and spectroscopy , showed an overall agreement , especially for the modes which have the photometric amplitudes and phases determined with high accuracy .",
    "these nine frequencies are in the range of @xmath107 c / d , encompassing eight p modes and one high - order g mode .",
    "a very promising result is that the empirical value of @xmath1 for the spb - type mode , @xmath108 c / d , agrees with theoretical computations .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the @xmath1-parameter for the radial fundamental mode , @xmath32 , showed that a concordance could be achieved only with the opal opacity data .",
    "the same result was obtained by us for the @xmath3 cep variable @xmath4 oph ( ddw09 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the same comparison for the high - order g mode , @xmath45 , favoured the op data .",
    "this discrepancy calls for an explanation and indicates that something is still missing in the computations of opacity data .",
    "complex asteroseismology of hybrid b - type pulsators can bring us closer to a solution .",

    "<S> in particular , the concordance of the empirical and theoretical values of @xmath1 we obtained for the high - order g mode opens a new gate in seismic studies of the main - sequence hybrid pulsators . </S>",
    "<S> the most intriguing and challenging result is that whereas an agreement of the theoretical and empirical values of @xmath1 for the radial mode can be achieved only with the opal data , a preference for the op tables is derived from the analysis of the high - order gravity mode .    </S>",
