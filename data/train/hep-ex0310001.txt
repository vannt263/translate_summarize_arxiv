    "in the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model the @xmath0 process is considered as a transition @xmath4 .",
    "further the decay parameters can be related with @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "another approach to the decays is a non - relativistic quark model ( nqm ) . in this model vector mesons considered as composite from valent quark with codirected spins , while pseudoscalar mesons with opposite directed spins .",
    "the decay may be explained as spin overturn with photon emission ( magneto - dipole transition)@xcite .",
    "the study of such decays is important for understanding light mesons structure and tests of strong interactions at low energies .",
    "the experiment was made with snd detector @xcite at vepp-2 m collider@xcite .",
    "the snd detector consists of tracking system , electromagnetic calorimeter and muon veto system .",
    "the principal part of the detector is an electromagnetic calorimeter .",

    "presented work is an extension of the studies published in ref.@xcite but using additional data .",
    "the data were collected in experiments in 1998 and 2000 @xcite :    * phi98 : energy range @xmath11  gev , integrated luminosity @xmath12 ( @xmath13 @xmath14-mesons ) * ome00 : energy range @xmath15  gev , integrated luminosity @xmath16 ( @xmath17 @xmath18-mesons )",
    "the process @xmath0 was studied in the @xmath19 final state .",
    "main background sources are @xmath20 ( qed origin ) ; @xmath21 misidentified because of additional clusters from machine background ; @xmath22 , and cosmic background .",
    "for luminosity calculation events of the @xmath21 process were used .",
    "the events were accepted by first level trigger which allows two or more clusters in calorimeter , no signal in either tracking or muon system , energy deposition in calorimeter greater then some threshold ( which varied but never was greater than @xmath23 ) .",
    "preliminary selection included following cuts : no charged tracks , number of clusters in calorimeter @xmath24 , calorimeter energy deposition @xmath25 , calorimeter total momentum @xmath26 , polar angles of two most energetic clusters @xmath27 , polar angle of the next by energy cluster @xmath28 , its energy deposition @xmath29 .",
    "kinematic fit with energy and momentum conservation constraints was applied to selected events .",
    "it improved @xmath30 mass resolution from @xmath31  mev to @xmath32  mev .",
    "cut on the fit quality parameter @xmath33 was then applied .",
    "selected events were subdivided into two classes : @xmath34  mev@xmath35  mev ( class a ) and the rest ( class b ) .",
    "class b events were used to cross - check our understanding of background contribution and estimate related systematic uncertainty . for class",
    "a @xmath36 events were selected .    for luminosity calculation events",
    "were selected ( class c ) with no charged tracks , two or more clusters with calorimeter energy deposition @xmath37 , polar angles @xmath27 , acollinearity @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "events satisfying preliminary selection cuts for a and b classes were excluded .",
    "it is necessary to note significant contribution of @xmath0 events ( up to @xmath40 at @xmath18 peak ) to this class .",
    "cross section of the studied process was parametrized with usual variable width breit - wigner description @xcite .",
    "more details published in ref.@xcite .",
    "cross sections @xmath41 of the @xmath42 transitions at resonances mass ( @xmath43 ) were approximation parameters .",
    "other parameters considered were relative phases @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and constant real amplitude @xmath46 taking into account possible contribution from higher resonances decays .",
    "masses and widths of @xmath47-mesons and branching ratios of @xmath18 and @xmath14 major decay modes were taken from previous snd measurements @xcite , other external parameters were taken from review of particle physics @xcite .",
    "visible cross section of @xmath48 was calculated taking into account radiative correction @xcite and dependency on registration efficiency from the energy of initial state radiation photons .",

    "cross section approximation was done using maximum likelihood method .",
    "classes a , b , c were approximated at the same fit .",
    "integrated luminosity was recalculated at the every minimization step .",
    "four models were used for approximation : ( 1 ) no @xmath49 meson decay contribution ; ( 2 ) including @xmath49 meson contribution , with fixed @xmath50 relative phase ; ( 3 ) including @xmath49 meson contribution , @xmath44 estimated from electromagnetic @xmath50 mixing @xcite ; ( 4 ) including @xmath49 meson contribution , with electromagnetic @xmath50 mixing fixed using @xmath51 , and constant real amplitude .",
