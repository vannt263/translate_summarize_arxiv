    "the generally covariant canonical quantization of gravity has been proposed in @xcite . as a result",
    ", the well - known wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) equation has been obtained from the hamiltonian formulation of the general relativity theory ( gr ) . the main problem preventing a further development of the canonical quantum gravity",
    "is an absence of explicit evolution that is a consequence of the hamiltonian constraint ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "it is well - known , that the string theory @xcite has the hamiltonian constraint , as well , but it does not face the `` problem of time '' .",
    "the point is that either the equations of motion are quantized ( in the covariant approach ) or the time - dependent gauges are used ( in the light - cone approach ) in the quantized string theory . from the other hand ,",
    "the wdw equation is not used in the string theory although this possibility was discussed @xcite .",
    "a thought suggests itself , that the quantization of the equations of motion can be suitable also in the quantum gravity and , at the same time , the wdw equation can make sense for some kinds of strings .    in our previous works @xcite ,",
    "we have demonstrated the quantization scheme including both quantization of the equations of motion and the wdw equation for a minisuperspace model .",
    "the ideology of quantization is quite similar to that in the string theory , where some time - dependent gauge is used , except the fact that the gauge is not imposed at all times but only at the initial instant and thereafter it is permissible for operators to evolve in accordance with the equations of motion .",
    "another distinctive feature of the method proposed is that the evolvable operators ( so - called , quasi - heisenberg operators ) act in a space of the solutions of the wdw equation , which are normalized in the klein - gordon style .",
    "here we extend the quasi - heisenberg quantization scheme to the string in the curved background space that can be treated as an inhomogeneous ( 1 + 1)-dimensional toy model of the quantum gravity .",
    "we shall follow a heuristic method to obtain a spatially inhomogeneous gravity model in two space - time dimensions .",
    "the lagrangian for a gravitation and a scalar field @xmath0 can be written in the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 @xcite and @xmath3 is the planck mass , which is chosen as @xmath4 .",
    "if one restricts a metric to the form @xmath5 the resulting lagrangian becomes : [ lagr ] where a prime denotes a derivative over the time .    the last term in eq . ( [ lagr ] )",
    "can be omitted as a total divergence .",
    "the variation with respect to @xmath6 gives the hamiltonian constraint : @xmath7    hereinafter , let us consider the conformal time gauge @xmath8 .",
    "the term @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ lagr ] ) does not affect the equations of motion , which have the form m_p^2a^-m_p^2",
    "2-()^2)-2 a^3 m^2 ^ 2=0 , + ^+2 ^ -(a^2)+a^2m^2=0 .",
    "then , the time evolution of the hamiltonian constraint can be expressed as : _",
    "h= , where the momentum constraint is @xmath10 . on the contrary",
    ", the time derivative of the momentum constraint is not expressed through @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "thus , this system does not belong to the fist kind one @xcite unlike gr .",
    "nevertheless , if one considers an ( 1 + 1)-dimensional analog of ( [ lagr ] ) with a massless scalar field @xmath13 ( @xmath14 denotes the only spatial variable ) , the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) proves to correspond to a string propagating against some curved background space and , thus , it gives a completely self - consistent system of constraints like that of gr .",
    "it is believed that the superstring theory shall include the gr .",
    "nevertheless , one may try to connect the string theory with the gr directly by means of reduction of the gr lagrangian on assumption that the space - time has some symmetry @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we shall demonstrate that the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) with a nonuniform scale factor describes a string against a curved background .",
    "such a string model can be interpreted as an inhomogeneous toy model for the quantum gravity .",
    "let us write the standard form of action for a bosonic string @xcite in a background space @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "the metric tensor @xmath17 describes the intrinsic geometry of a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional manifold and @xmath18 describes the geometry of a background space .",
    "variation with respect to @xmath17 leads to the constraints @xcite : @xmath19    if one takes @xmath20 , the metric tensor @xmath21 in the form of    @xmath22 and the metric tensor @xmath23 of a background space as g= (    cc m_p^2 & 0 + 0 & -a^2    ) , [ bmetr ] it results in the lagrangian for the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional model l=(_a^2 ( n-)+m_p^2-m_p^2 +  -+a^2_^2 ( - n)+)d .",
    "[ ll ] the substitutions of @xmath24 and @xmath8 into ( [ ll ] ) reduces it to ( [ lag ] ) .",
    "thus , the constraints ( [ 9 ] ) become the hamiltonian and momentum constraints of the model considered .    in a more general case",

[ bmetr1 ]    let us denote @xmath27 and rewrite the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) in the terms of @xmath28 and a set of scalar fields :    l = e^2(-m_p^2 ^ 2+^ 2+m_p^2(_)^2-(_)^2)d = 0 , where @xmath29 .",
    "the relevant hamiltonian and momentum constraints ( [ 9 ] ) , written in the terms of momentums @xmath30 and @xmath31 take the form of @xmath32 the constraints algebra demonstrates that there are no new constraints : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the derivative of the dirac delta - function , and the poisson brackets are implied : [ pois ] .",
    "the next step is the quantization of the model presented .",
    "it is known , that the string theory demands @xmath35 to have the critical dimension , which is of 26 for a bosonic string .",
    "nevertheless , even for the critical dimension , one can not expect that the string theory gives a satisfactory quantization of the model against a curved background .",
    "the point is that the string theory provides a consistent quantization only if the ricci tensor @xmath36 of the background metric @xmath23 equals to zero @xcite . for @xmath37 given by ( [ bmetr1 ] ) ,",
    "it is nonzero if the dimension of @xmath35 is higher than two ( the scalar curvature is constant in the case considered ) .",
    "however , it was stated @xcite that an inclusion of some other fields ( e.g. , dilaton ) leads to the standard einstein equations @xmath38 for the background metric and it can be considered as a new principle of derivation of the einstein equations @xcite .    it should be noted , that the string representation arises in our paper in a quite different context than the ordinary one ( in particular , as used in @xcite ) . in our model",
    "the background space is an isospin - like space determined by the number of scalar fields ( matter degrees of freedom , whereas the physical space , where the observers and detectors could be situated ) is a @xmath39 space . on the contrary",
    ", the ordinary string theory considers a background space as `` physical '' one , whereas a @xmath40space corresponds to `` internal degrees of freedom '' .",
    "thus , the quantization resulting in the dimension constraints for a background space ( i.e. , for a number of matter fields in our case ) can be hardly acceptable in the model considered . in the next section",
    ", we shall present the quantization scheme for @xmath41 and a background space without any dimension constraints .",
    "the minisuperspace model presented in @xcite demonstrates that the quasi - heisenberg quantization consists in the following : one has to set the initial values for the operators , which evolve in accordance with the operator equations of motion .",
    "the question is to construct the representation for these operators and the space where they act . in our approach",
    "this problem is solved by consideration of the hamiltonian constraint as the wdw equation and choice of the plane @xmath42 for normalization of a wave function in the klein - gordon style . in the general case ,",
    "the momentum constraint is also should be taken into account .",
    "this requires to impose one additional gauge condition .",
    "the light cone gauge @xcite is widely used in the string theory .",
    "since it contains necessarily a nonzero mean momentum , it is hardly acceptable for our isotropic cosmological - like model .",
    "thus , it is necessary to propose some new gauge .",
    "the hint arises from the form of the momentum constraint , which reminds that in the theory of a particle moving on a sphere @xcite .    at first , let us consider a simpler problem described by the hamiltonian h=(-p_0 ^ 2+p^2)=0 , [ gp ] which is similar to that of a massless relativistic particle .",

    ". hence one may conclude , that the acceleration of the universe expansion is determined by the mean value of the difference of potential and kinetic energies of field oscillators @xcite . however , there is no accelerated universe expansion in the case considered here in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , where the quantum fields against a classical background are analyzed ( also , see @xcite where the virial theorem for a vacuum state is discussed ) .",
    "as it has been mentioned , a possible source of this problem is that a sole scalar field under consideration is mixed too strongly with the background .",
    "another reason is that the estimation is too rough and does not take into account an explicit structure of quantum states .",
    "the quantization scheme for some particular case of the string in a curved background space has been proposed .",
    "this scheme is adapted for quantization of the systems possessing a global evolution .",
    "the typical feature of such quantization is that we use the hyperplane @xmath42 and the initial condition for the quasi - heisenberg operators at the initial moment of time , that allows a considerable simplification of the wdw equation as well as the formulation of operators .",
    "one may hope , that such a method can be useful for the quantization of gr owing to solvability of the wdw equation in the vicinity of @xmath42 .",
    "it should be noted , that , if the wave function obeys the wdw equation , there exists no an equivalent schrdinger picture for this quantization scheme .",
    "although finding of a solution of operator equations for the quasi - heisenberg operators is extremely difficult task , it can be made numerically hereafter .",
    "since the constraints are imposed as the operator equations at the initial moment of time , a certain operator ordering is required in the operator equations of motion to provide the conservation of constraints during a quantum evolution .",
    "otherwise , the constraints will be violated during an evolution due to quantum noise arising from the operator noncommutativity .",
    "the heuristic estimations for a quantum string in the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional background space with the weakened constraints have been developed .",
    "it has been found , that the quantum oscillations of the scale factor compensate the oscillations of the scalar field .",
    "thus , the cosmological constant problem may not arise if the scale factor is quantized in a proper way .",
    "it has been shown , that the mean value of the universe acceleration expansion is proportional to the difference of potential and kinetic energies of field oscillators , but this topic needs more careful investigation hereafter .",
