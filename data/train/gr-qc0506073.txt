    "string theory predicts that our world has more dimensions than the 4 we see around us every day . the usual way out of this apparent discrepancy is to say that the additional dimensions are compactified and small . in the simplest case",
    "the extra dimensions are just circles .",
    "string theory is also a theory of gravity .",
    "it is therefore a natural and interesting question to ask what is the behavior of the classical solutions of general relativity in spacetimes where one or more dimensions are compactified .",
    "this question is however surprisingly hard to answer .",
    "the periodic analogue of a schwarzschild black hole in a space of topology @xmath0 has been st udied more or less independently by majumdar @xcite , papapetrou @xcite , myers @xcite , korotkin and nicolai @xcite as well as by frolov and frolov @xcite . in higher dimensions",
    "the full solution is known only implicitly @xcite .",
    "the problem becomes even more interesting when one realizes , following gregory and laflamme @xcite , that there is a competition between different gravitational configurations with the same mass and charges but with different symmetries and even of different horizon topology .",
    "which configuration is stable depends on the particular value of the mass and the charges .",
    "for instance , a long and thin black string becomes unstable and will `` decay '' into a new configuration with higher entropy . this new configuration could for instance be a nontranslationally invariant black string or an infinite array of black holes .",
    "the phase diagram of black objects in higher dimensional circle space times has a very rich structure @xcite .",
    "only parts of it is accessible to analytical methods and the most interesting pices has been calculated only numerically @xcite or using perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "it would therefore clearly be of great interest to have a better analytical understanding of the various solutions that could appear .    in this paper",
    "we perform a more modest task .",
    "we generalize the solution given in @xcite to arbitrary electric and nut charge . in doing",
    "so we find a new parameter of the solution which has not been recognized before .",
    "we analyze the physical meaning of this parameter .",
    "we also notice that adding nut charge to the solution makes it more well behaved .",
    "maybe this is a feature which would persist in higher dimensions ?",
    "our method heavily relies on weyl coordinates .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , because of symmetry reasons , weyl coordinates are expected to be useful at most in 4 and 5 dimensions .",
    "this is something which would have to be overcome if one would like to generalize our results to higher dimensions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is a general discussion of properties of the four dimensional einstein - maxwells equations important for our problem . in section 3",
    "we discuss the ( nonperiodic ) reissner - nordstrm - nut solution . in section 4",
    "we find its periodic generalization and discuss the metric in various limits . in section 5",
    "we give our conclusions .",
    "we write a general stationary metric with timelike killing vector @xmath1 as @xmath2 where @xmath3 which implies that @xmath4 and that @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are stationary fields , lie dragged by @xmath1 .",
    "we now decompose the electromagnetic field strength @xmath8 by defining the electric and magnetic fields @xmath9 and @xmath10 with respect to @xmath1 : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the dual field strength @xmath13 it then follows that @xmath14 } - \\epsilon_{ab}{}^{cd}b_c\\mu_d \\\\    * f_{ab } & = 2b_{[a}\\mu_{b ] } + \\epsilon_{ab}{}^{cd}e_c\\mu_d.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming that @xmath8 is stationary as well as source - free so that @xmath12 is closed , then both @xmath9 and @xmath10 are gradients of stationary scalars .",
    "hence we introduce electric and magnetic potentials @xmath15 and @xmath16 according to @xmath17 moreover , with the electromagnetic field being the only matter source , a twist scalar @xmath18 , likewise stationary , can be introduced by where @xmath19 . ]",
    "@xmath20 the tensor @xmath7 can be viewed as a metric on the three - dimensional manifold @xmath21 of killing orbits and we shall use that the full 4d einstein - maxwell equations are now equivalent to the 3d equations obtained from the action @xmath22,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the ricci scalar , inverse and levi - civita connection of @xmath7 .",
    "this action describes three - dimensional euclidean gravity coupled to a certain sigma model .",
    "more precisely , the effective matter part of the action is that of a wave map from @xmath21 to a four - dimensional target space with metric @xmath26 ^ 2},\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the complex ernst potentials @xmath29 this is an einstein metric , whose ricci tensor obeys @xmath30 if we use as target space coordinates @xmath31 the real variables @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the amplitude and phase of @xmath28 , @xmath35 the target metric takes the neat form @xmath36 which makes it evident that it has signature @xmath37 .",
    "now , varying the action with respect to @xmath24 gives @xmath38 while variation with respect to the target space coordinates @xmath31 leads to the wave map equation @xmath39 with @xmath40 being the christoffel symbols of @xmath41 . for our purposes",
    "it is important to note that if the @xmath31 all depend solely on one free function @xmath42 , then eqs . and become @xmath43 now , eq .   tells us that the curve @xmath44 is a geodesic , since ,",
    "as @xmath7 is supposed to be a positive - definite metric , it can not happen that @xmath45 vanishes identically unless @xmath42 is constant .",
    "using the freedom to reparametrize the geodesic , we can assume that it is affinely parametrized and arrive at the equations @xmath46 in this paper we focus exclusively on this class of solutions , which we shall refer to as geodesic solutions .",
    "let us now assume that the stationary spacetime is also axisymmetric with an axisymmetry generator @xmath47 that commutes with the timelike killing vector @xmath1 .",
    "we can then introduce coordinates @xmath48 such that @xmath49 , @xmath50 while the three - metric @xmath7 and one - form @xmath6 take the forms @xmath51 the metric functions @xmath5 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 obviously depend on @xmath55 and @xmath56 only .",
    "if we assume that @xmath42 also depends solely on @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( although it could have a linear dependence on @xmath57 with constant coefficient , a possibility which we do not consider here ) , the @xmath58-component of eq .   becomes @xmath59 making it possible to choose @xmath55 and @xmath56 such that @xmath60 , a choice well - known as weyl ( canonical ) coordinates .",
    "the great advantage of being able to use these coordinates is that the unknown metric function @xmath52 does not enter the laplace equation ( nor the more general wave map equation ) , which will thus be identical to the laplace equation in flat space , expressed in cylindrical coordinates , for an unknown function that is independent of @xmath57 ; @xmath61 with the use of this equation , the remaining components of eq .",
    "become @xmath62 \\\\    & k_{,z } = 2\\epsilon\\rho\\,\\omega_{,\\rho}\\,\\omega_{,z } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] while eq .",
    "gives @xmath63 with @xmath64 being a constant equal to the conserved geodesic momentum associated with the cyclic coordinate @xmath18 of the target space metric .",
    "explicitly , @xmath65 a recipe for finding a solution of the type considered here is thus to choose an appropriate geodesic of the target space and an appropriate solution to the flat space laplace equation .",
    "the geodesic then gives the four target space functions as functions of @xmath42 , including the metric component @xmath5 and the potentials @xmath15 and @xmath16 which completely determine the electromagnetic field via eqs .   and .",
    "what then remains is to integrate the two pairs of equations and to determine the remaining spacetime metric components @xmath52 and @xmath54 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "is the integrability condition for both pairs of equations ( when @xmath66 ) .",
    "using schwarzschild type coordinates , the reissner - nordstrm - nut ( rnn ) solution with mass @xmath67 , electric charge @xmath68 and nut ( gravitational monopole ) charge @xmath69 is @xmath70 where @xmath71 here we have defined @xmath72 while @xmath73 is a constant which should be set to @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) to make the half - axis @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) explicitly regular , leaving the other half - axis  the misner string  singular , as @xmath78 is not a well - behaved one - form at @xmath79 .",
    "however , it is well - known that both half - axes can be made regular , since changing @xmath73 from @xmath74 to @xmath75 can be mimicked by changing the time coordinate from @xmath80 to @xmath81 . the price",
    "to pay is closed timelike curves since it requires that @xmath80 and @xmath82 should both be periodic with period @xmath83 .",
    "the three - metric @xmath7 for this solution is seen to be @xmath84 and the three remaining target space scalars are given by @xmath85 since all the @xmath31 depend on @xmath86 only , this is a geodesic solution . in the non - extremal case @xmath87 ,",
    "the geodesic is spacelike ( @xmath88 ) and explicitly given by @xmath89},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the arclength parameter for the geodesic , and here the function that satisfies the laplace equation , namely @xmath91 however , we shall instead think of the geodesic as parametrized by the rescaled affine parameter @xmath92 which implies that the norm of the geodesic tangent vector has norm @xmath93 .",
    "the reason for this is that we will then straightforwardly be able to treat the extremal case  which corresponds to a null geodesic ( @xmath94 )  as the @xmath95 limit of the non - extremal case . indeed , taking this limit for the above formulae , we find that the spacelike geodesic goes over into a lightlike one ; @xmath96},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while @xmath42 goes over into @xmath97 this limiting procedure would not have worked , had we used @xmath90 as the affine parameter .",
    "moreover , @xmath42 has the large @xmath86 asymptotic behaviour @xmath98 which means that it is @xmath42 , rather than @xmath90 , that corresponds to a newtonian gravitational potential .",
    "however , although we will think of the geodesic as parametrized by @xmath42 , we will often work with @xmath90 in subsequent calculations , since the factor @xmath99 would otherwise often appear merely as an annoying appendage .    for future reference , we here finally calculate the conserved geodesic momentum @xmath64 according to the formula , to find the simple relation @xmath100      a special and somewhat surprising feature of the rnn solution is that although no sources are included for the electromagnetic field , the result of calculating the electric charge @xmath101 by integrating @xmath12 over a two - sphere of constant @xmath80 and @xmath86 and dividing by @xmath102 is not what one would naively expect from stoke s theorem , the result is not independent of the choice of two - sphere but depends on the radius ; @xmath103 we also calculate the magnetic charge @xmath104 by integrating @xmath8 over the same sphere to find @xmath105 obviously we have @xmath106 , @xmath107 asymptotically as @xmath108 , so at infinity the solution is purely electric with charge @xmath68 .",
    "it is worth noting that the relation @xmath109 holds as an identity , for all @xmath86 .",
    "the reason why it is possible that electric and magnetic charges depend on @xmath86 is that the gravitomagnetic vector potential @xmath110 enters not only the metric but also the electromagnetic field strength .",
    "thus the latter is singular on the misner string , on @xmath111 or @xmath112 ( or both ) depending on how @xmath73 is chosen .",
    "as the misner string goes through every two - sphere that we integrate over , we can not expect stoke s theorem to imply that the charges should be independent of the choice of sphere .",
    "interestingly , if we refrain from removing the singularity by introducing periodic time , the misner string must be thought of as a concrete physical object as it carries electric and magnetic charge density .      for the rnn solution",
    ", the transformation from schwarzschild type coordinates to weyl coordinates reads @xmath113 with inverse transformation @xmath114 where @xmath115 the functions @xmath42 , @xmath52 and @xmath54 are now given by @xmath116 in the non - extremal case @xmath87 , the function @xmath42 is the potential of an infinitely thin rod located at @xmath117 , @xmath118 and having a line density @xmath119 per unit length , which means that the line density can be interpreted as the mass line density . note that in the extremal case @xmath120 , the function @xmath52 vanishes identically leaving the three - metric @xmath7 flat .",
    "moreover @xmath121 reduces to @xmath122 and @xmath42 to the standard monopole solution @xmath123 .",
    "we will now construct compactified versions of the rnn solution , which generalize the compactified schwarzschild solution discussed in @xcite .",
    "the approach we take can be summerized as follows :    * for every member of the rnn family of solutions , compactify the function @xmath42 by using canonical weyl coordinates and taking the @xmath56-periodic analogue of the original solution to the laplace equation .",
    "this is straightforward due to the linearity of the latter . * insert @xmath42 into",
    "the _ same _ geodesic that defines the original rnn solution . *",
    "integrate eqs .   and to find the remaining metric functions @xmath52 and @xmath54 .    before we start , some general remarks about the first of these steps are in order . as proved by korotkin and nicolai @xcite ,",
    "if @xmath124 is a solution to the laplace equation with the asymptotic behaviour @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath67 is some constant ( in our case the mass ) , then the series @xmath127 , \\qquad a_n = \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{ll } \\ds\\frac{m}{l\\abs{n } }   & \\textrm{if $ n\\neq 0 $ } \\\\                                   0 & \\textrm{if $ n=0 $ }          \\end{array}\\right . , \\ ] ] is convergent for any @xmath128 such that @xmath129 does not coincide with a singular point of @xmath124 for any integer @xmath130 .",
    "the resulting function @xmath42 then obviously defines a @xmath56-periodic solution to the laplace equation with period @xmath131 .",
    "the constants @xmath132 are essential as they make the series converge , but one can not say that they are uniquely determined as one could add to @xmath132 any other @xmath130-dependent constant @xmath133 that falls off faster than @xmath134 as @xmath135 so that @xmath136 is a finite constant . in other words , the @xmath56-periodic analogue of the function @xmath124",
    "is only defined up to an additive constant @xmath137 .",
    "korotkin and nicolai fix this constant by taking eq .   as it stands ( @xmath138 ) to define @xmath139 , but this choice has not been made by the other workers that have studied the compactified schwarzschild black hole ; while myers@xcite makes an explicitly different choice of @xmath132 leading to a certain non - zero @xmath137 , frolov and frolov@xcite instead use a green s function method to compactify which in effect corresponds to a third choice of @xmath137 .",
    "now , since the function @xmath139 is periodic in @xmath56 , it does not make sense to study its behaviour for large @xmath140 , but for large @xmath55 it has the asymptotic behaviour @xmath141 if @xmath42 would tend to a constant in this limit , it would be natural to make that constant vanish by a suitable choice of @xmath137 .",
    "however , since @xmath42 instead diverges logarithmically ( unless @xmath142 ) , we see no physical motivation for fixing @xmath137 at any particular value and hence we will keep it as a free parameter .",
    "we will now implement the compactification scheme as outlined above .",

    "the value of @xmath170 has to be determined from the requirement that the axis be regular . starting with the off - horizon section ,",
    "regularity means absence of a conical singularity which is in turn means that @xmath52 should vanish as @xmath172 , at least if we assume that @xmath54 vanishes in that limit , which can always be achieved as we shall see below .",
    "thus , since the constant @xmath167 is zero in this case , we directly obtain @xmath173 .",

    "again , these two choices do not correspond to different physics , but are related by a change of time @xmath188 which results in time periodicity with the period @xmath83 .",

    "although it may not have been obvious from the way we introduced it , the parameter @xmath159 ( denoted the same way in @xcite but with an unbarred @xmath16 in @xcite and @xcite ) can be defined as @xmath237 @xmath159 is the value of @xmath238 evaluated at either of the poles of the event horizon , with @xmath238 being the difference between the function @xmath90 for the deformed black hole ( whether the deformation is due to compactification as in our case , or to external matter ) and the function @xmath239 for the undeformed rnn solution with the same @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 . since as @xmath240",
    ", we have @xmath241 it follows that @xmath159 is closely related to the change in horizon pole redshift factor that the deformation produces . in the schwarzschild case @xmath215 ,",
    "the relation is more direct since @xmath242 in that case .",
    "the term `` horizon redshift factor '' must not be taken too literally , however , since it normally refers to an asymptotically flat situation when the value of @xmath243 gives the redshift factor between the point of evaluation and infinity where @xmath244 .",
    "anyhow , we shall refer to @xmath159 as the _ redshift parameter_. in table [ table : ubar ] we display how @xmath159 has in effect been fixed by previous workers that have studied the compactified schwarzschild solution .",
    "as we see no reason why any one of these choices should be better than the other two , we prefer to keep @xmath159 as a free parameter .",
    "other quantities that are interesting to calculate on the horizon are the surface gravity @xmath245 and komar mass @xmath246 with respect to the killing vector @xmath1 , as well as the electric and magnetic charges and potentials .",
    "we find that these quantities are given by @xmath247 we note that the surface gravity is constant over the event horizon and thus the zeroth law of thermodynamics holds .",
    "moreover the electric and magnetic potentials are constant as well .",
    "in fact the electromagnetic charges and potentials take the exact same values as in the noncompactified case .",
    "for a discussion of further thermodynamic properties , we refer the reader to the general framwork for distorted charged black holes@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , to our knowledge no such framework exists in the case of nonzero nut charge , but providing it here would be beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      a quantity that characterizes the off - horizon section of the symmetry axis is the proper spatial separation between the poles of the black hole .",
    "it can be calculated as @xmath248 with @xmath5 evaluated at @xmath153 . to get a general idea of how this quantity depends on the choice of charges @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69",
    ", we have held the quotients @xmath249 and @xmath250 fixed at four different values and , with the redshift parameter @xmath159 set to zero , plotted @xmath251 as a function of @xmath211 ( figure [ fig : l_sep ] ) .",
    "since @xmath252 depends nontrivially on how one chooses @xmath159 to depend on @xmath211 , our plot for the case @xmath215 looks different than the one given by frolov and frolov @xcite .",
    "in particular , in @xcite @xmath252 tends to a finite value rather than zero as @xmath253 , which is counter - intuitive since in that limit the polar points reach each other as the event horizon fills the whole axis .",
    "again , this is directly related to the behaviour of @xmath159 in the same limit . however , any choice of @xmath159 which stays _ finite _ results in a vanishing @xmath252 as @xmath253 , just like for @xmath254 . to show the effect of different choices of @xmath159 , we have also plotted @xmath252 as a function of @xmath211 for the different choices of @xmath159 collected in table [ table : ubar ] , with the choice @xmath254",

    "as discussed for instance by bick @xcite , the levi - civita metric contains two essential parameters @xmath265 and @xmath266 and can be written in the standard form @xmath267 where the coordinates @xmath268 , @xmath269 and @xmath270 as well as the _ conicity parameter _ @xmath266 in general carry dimension in a nonstandard way .",
    "the conicity parameter can obviously be set to unity by rescaling the coordinate @xmath57 as @xmath271 , but since we insist that @xmath57 be a periodic coordinate with the standard range @xmath272 , the value of @xmath266 can not be viewed as a coordinate choice .",
    "in fact , since we are dealing with a compactified spacetime for which @xmath56 is also a periodic coordinate with a fixed range , the general static cylindrically symmetric solution  what one might call the _ compactified levi - civita solution _",
    " has instead three essential parameters , which for instance can be taken to be our @xmath211 , @xmath273 and @xmath274 , with @xmath211 directly corresponding to @xmath265 .    setting the electric charge @xmath68 to zero while having a non - vanishing nut charge @xmath69 makes it possible to reexpress @xmath263 as @xmath275}},\\ ] ] where ( note that @xmath276 in this case ) @xmath277 as should be expected , this vacuum solution is the `` cylindrical analogue of nut space '' that was constructed and studied by nouri - zonoz@xcite . according to nouri - zonoz ,",
    "the `` gravitomagnetic charge per unit length '' is ( up to sign ) equal to the coefficient of @xmath56 in the expression for @xmath54 , in our case @xmath278 .",
    "however , what we have constructed here is the asymptotic field of a black hole with nut charge @xmath69 in a space with a compactified dimension of ( @xmath56-coordinate ) length @xmath131 , so we expect the nut charge per unit @xmath56-length to be @xmath279 .",
    "we believe that the discrepancy of a factor of @xmath280 is only a matter of definitions ( nouri - zonoz `` gravitomagnetic charge '' is four times nut charge , when the latter is definied so that its value for the rnn metric is @xmath69 .",
    "setting @xmath281 but keeping a non - zero electric charge @xmath68 , the general asymptotic solution instead becomes the cylindrically symmetric einstein - maxwell solution with a purely electric maxwell field .",
    "this is one of the solutions constructed and studied by richterek @xcite as well as miguelote @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath263 can in this case be written as @xmath282 } } ,    \\qquad \\rho_2 = \\parfrac{r_+}{r_-}^{\\!\\!\\frac1{2\\beta}}\\rho_0.\\ ] ] note that @xmath263 diverges at a finite cylinder radius @xmath283 , indicating that there should be a curvature singularity there .",
    "this is indeed the case , as noticed in @xcite , but let us see this explicitly by calculating the energy density of the electromagnetic field with respect to the unit timelike vector field @xmath284 where @xmath285 , as before .",
    "the result , in the general case with all three charges @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 arbitrary , is @xmath286 clearly @xmath287 diverges at finite @xmath55 exactly when @xmath263 does .",
    "however , the curvature singularity at @xmath283 disappears as soon as a nut charge @xmath69 is turned on , since the denominator of the right hand side of eq .",
    "is then the sum of two squares which can not vanish simultaneously .",
    "of course , one can make the curvature grow arbitrarily large close to @xmath283 by choosing the quotient @xmath288 sufficiently small .",
    "this feature is not only present in the asymptotic solution discussed here , but also in the full compactified rnn solution with the @xmath56-dependent fourier terms turned back on .",
    "the reason for this is that the range of the function @xmath42 changes from @xmath289 to @xmath290 when we compactify the spacetime by making the coordinate @xmath56 periodic ; in both cases @xmath291 occurs at the event horizon , at @xmath117 , @xmath118 , but @xmath256 sends @xmath42 to @xmath292 rather than zero in the compactified case . in particular , for @xmath293 , the compactified @xmath90 will take on the positive value @xmath294 for which @xmath263 diverges , as can be seen from eq .  .",
    "again , this gives a curvature singularity which however is regularized by turning on a nut charge @xmath69 , however small . the difference , compared to the asymptotic solution , is that the curvature singularity now occurs on some torus @xmath295 which is not a simple flat torus @xmath296 .",
    "the asymptotic solution also has a curvature singularity on the axis @xmath117 for @xmath297 , but this is in contrast to the full compactified rnn solution which by construction is regular on that axis .",
    "another interesting feature related to the nut parameter @xmath69 is that although the spacetime metric is cylindrically symmetric in the sense that no physically measurable quantities depend on the @xmath56 , this coordiate still appears in the expression for @xmath54 .",
    "what is interesting is that if we demand that the metric be explicitly periodic in @xmath56 with period @xmath131 , then the metric must be unchanged under @xmath298 for any integer @xmath130 .",
    "this is true , granted that @xmath80 is periodic with period @xmath83 ( just like for the non - compactified rnn solution we started out with ) , since we can mimick the shift in @xmath73 by letting @xmath299 .",
    "turning finally to the extremal case @xmath300 , we must use @xmath301 instead of @xmath90 before taking the limit @xmath229 .",
    "the limit then gives @xmath302 , \\qquad u ' = \\lim_{\\beta\\rarr 0}\\beta^{-1}\\bar{u } \\\\    & k = 0 \\\\    & \\omega = \\frac{4lz}{l } + \\omega',\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so the asymptotic spacetime metric is in this case @xmath303 with , using eq .",
    ", @xmath304 ^ 2+\\left[\\dsfrac{2l}{l}\\,\\ln{\\!(\\rho/\\rho_3)}\\right]^2 } ,   \\qquad \\rho_3 = 2le^{-u'-\\gamma}.\\ ] ] just like in the nonextremal case , this asymptotic solution fails to be asymptotically flat , albeit in a weaker manner .",
    "also , the discussion concerning the curvature singularity at finite @xmath55 applies here as well . in particular , from eq .",
    "it follows that if @xmath281 , the asymptotic solution has a curvature singularity at @xmath305 , but the singularity is removed when the nut charge @xmath69 is turned back on .",
    "having constructed and analyzed what we consider to be the natural periodic analogue of the reissner - nordstrm - nut solution , a question that naturally arises is whether or not any given asymptotically flat black hole has a periodic analogue and , if so , whether or not the periodic analogue is unique , given the period @xmath131 of the compactified coordinate . by identifying the target space geodesic that the non - compactified solution defines and assuming that the very same geodesic should be used for the compactified version",
    ", we have found that the problem essentially reduces to finding the appropriate axisymmetric solution to the laplace equation in flat space , just as in the schwarzschild case .",
    "there is thus a simple superposition principle at play , which makes compactification tractable when weyl coordinates are used .",
    "however , the low dimension requires a regularization procedure which introduces a one - parameter ambiguity as there is no obvious way to fix the freedom to add an arbitrary constant to the solution to the laplace equation . in all previous works on the periodic schwarzschild solution , this constant  the redshift parameter ",
    "was always fixed at an early stage and without any physical motivation for the specific choice made .",
    "as we have seen there are three different choices in the existing papers on the subject , which we take as support for instead keeping the parameter free , or at least fixing it at a later stage from physical considerations .",
    "one way of fixing it would be to require that a set of relations that hold for horizon quantities ( for instance the relation between the horizon area and the black hole charges ) should remain the same after compactification .",
    "if one could motivate why this should be the case , our method would give a neat one - to - one correspondance between standard and periodic reissner - nordstrm - nut black holes .",
    "of course , we have not given any proof that our method is correct , in some suitably defined sense .",
    "one could perhaps argue that it is not , based on the fact that our solution family has a curvature singularity surrounding the horizon in the case of electric but no nut charge .",
    "however , we see no way of avoiding such a singularity .",
    "indeed , the singularity in question is actually a general feature not just for our full solution with a nontrivial dependence on the periodic coordinate , but also for the cylindrically symmetric solution that is approached for large cylinder radii .",
    "since there simply is no other cylindrically symmetric solution available that could work as an asymptotic solution for a compactified reissner - nordstrm black hole , it seems at least likely that the exponentially decaying corrections to the asymptotic solution can not smooth out the singularity .",
    "one can think of several ways to extend our work while staying in four dimensions .",
    "one way would be to include a dilaton field with arbitrary coupling parameter .",
    "this would be straightforward to do , as our method would still be applicable with the dilaton simply entering as an extra target space coordinate",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether the inclusion of a dilaton could prevent the above - mentioned singularity from occuring .",
    "a general framework for distorted charged dilaton black holes has been provided by yazadjiev@xcite .",
    "it would be even more interesting if the periodic analogue of the kerr solution could be constructed .",
    "some indications of how this could be done were given in @xcite , but no explicit formulae were given there , except for a few first steps .",
    "since the noncompactifed kerr solution traces out a target space two - surface rather than a geodesic , it would no longer be possible to linearize the problem and thus more sophisticated methods , such as bcklund transformations , are needed .",
    "it would of course be even more interesting if our work could give some insights into how things work in higher dimensions .",
    "consider the einstein - maxwell equations for a static @xmath306-dimensional spacetime .",
    "dimensionally reducing with respect to the static killing vector , one arrives at einstein gravity in @xmath307 euclidean dimensions , coupled to a two - dimensional ( three - dimensional if a dilaton is included ) sigma model .",
    "one question one could ask is whether or not the target space geodesic that the @xmath306-dimensional reissner - nordstrm solution corresponds to would also be traced out when the solution is compactified on a circle .",
    "the work of harmark and obers actually suggests that this could be the case , as their ansatz is such that the target space coordinates are functionally dependent , thus corresponding to geodesic solutions .",
    "this does not mean that it would be easy to make analytical progress for @xmath308 , but nevertheless it could give a coordinate invariant way of thinking about the ansatz of these authors which in turn could lead to a deeper understanding of the general problem .",
    "it would be very interesting to investigate this matter further .",
