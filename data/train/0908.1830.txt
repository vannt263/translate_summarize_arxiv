    "sphere packing problems have been studied for at least the past few centuries , since kepler and newton .",
    "the densest packing of spheres in three dimensions is easy to guess and must have been known for quite a while , and was conjectured by kepler , but the fact was only proved recently by thomas hales @xcite .",
    "( under the assumption that the centers of the spheres lie on a lattice , the problem is much easier , and the answer was already known to gauss . )",
    "hales proof famously relies on a difficult computer calculation .",
    "even the two - dimensional case of sphere packing , the densest packing of circles in the plane , is nontrivial .",
    "this problem was solved by l. fejes tth only in 1940 . since then",
    ", there has also been a wide literature on densest packing of spheres in a bounded convex region , such as a circle , triangle , or square @xcite .",
    "the case of a region with a boundary seems much harder in general .",
    "we use the words `` disc packing '' in this article to distinguish from the area of circle packings and discrete conformal geometry @xcite . as an interesting historical note on disc packings , in 1964",
    "brczky used a subtle construction to disprove a conjecture of fejes tth , that a stable arrangement of discs in the plane , one where each disc is held in place by its neighbors , must have positive density @xcite .",
    "brczky s counterexample is at the heart of what we do here .",
    "regular @xmath3-gons and equilateral triangles are well known to tile the plane vertex - transitively @xcite . if suitably scaled discs are placed at the vertices of the polygons , one obtains a stable configuration , as in figure [ fig : sparse - stable ] .",
    "apparently some have conjectured that this configuration has minimal density @xcite .",
    "one computes that these discs asymptotically cover a fraction of @xmath4 of the plane .",
    "we note another planar stable configuration in figure [ fig : rigid5-planar ] , which we discovered while preparing this article .",
    "this planar configuration has a slightly greater density of @xmath5 , but larger empty regions .",
    "we note that this configuration easily embeds isometrically in a square .         and @xmath6.,width=336 ]    besides the discrete geometry background",
    ", we are also motivated by a problem in statistical physics , and in fact this was our original motivation .",
    "hard discs in a box is one of the most basic mathematical models for matter .",
    "here one considers the space of all possible configurations of @xmath0 non - overlapping discs of radius @xmath1 in a unit square .",
    "this space has a natural probability measure , which we will not discuss here .",
    "but conceptually one could think of noninteracting particles , or particles where attractive forces are so much weaker than repulsive forces that the repulsive forces dominates , and so in the limit making a constraint to non overlapping particles makes sense .",
    "see the background and references in section 4 of @xcite .",
    "it is of theoretical interest to try to understand basic properties of phase diagrams , even in this simple mathematical model .",
    "countless hours of computer simulations have been run with hundreds of discs , and various densities of @xmath1 .",
    "( for example , see chapter 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "it has been observed that there is a phase transition when @xmath7 . in particular if @xmath8 then the discs seem to be behave more `` liquid , '' and if @xmath9 , they are more `` solid , '' according to various statistics measured , indicating action at a distance , and so on .",
    "to sample a point in @xmath10 uniformly , the metropolis algorithm and its variants are used .",
    "the most basic implementation of metropolis is to start with a particular configuration of discs , then iterates the following algorithm : choose one of the @xmath0 discs uniformly randomly , and then perturb it randomly , by moving it uniformly within a smaller disc of radius @xmath11 .",
    "if the proposed new position of the disc does not go out of the box , and does not overlap with any other discs , then accept the move .",
    "otherwise , reject it .",
    "repeat this process as necessary .    in order to make the `` as necessary '' precise , diaconis , lebeau , and michel recently established useful bounds on the mixing time of the metropolis algorithm in general , and then applied their results to the specific case of hard discs in a box @xcite . in order to meaningfully discuss mixing time questions , they must require that the discs be sufficiently small that one can move from every configuration to every other configuration , via small moves by one disc at a time ( i.e. that the metropolis markov chain is irreducible ) , and they give an upper bound on the disc radius that guarantees that this is the case .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the space of all possible configurations of @xmath0 non - overlapping discs of radius @xmath1 in a unit square .",
    "a stable configuration represents an isolated point in @xmath10 .",
    "[ irreducible ] there exists a constant @xmath12 such that the metropolis markov chain on @xmath10 is irreducible whenever @xmath13 . in particular , there are no stable configurations in this range",
    ".    one might wonder if this result can be extended to larger @xmath1 .",
    "is it still true , for example , if @xmath14 ?",
    "however , just as in fejer tth s boundary - free version of this problem , the answer is no .",
    "the result of diaconis , lebeau , and michel is is essentially best possible .",
    "[ theorem - stable ] there exists a constant @xmath15 such that for arbitrarily large @xmath0 and @xmath16 , there exist stable configurations of @xmath0 discs of radius @xmath1 .",
    "this is our main result .",
    "we prove theorem [ theorem - stable ] in the next section .",
    "a positioning of @xmath0 nonoverlapping discs of radius @xmath1 in the unit square @xmath17 ^ 2 $ ] is a _",
    "configuration_. we say that a configuration is _ stable _ if each disc is held in place by its neighbors and the walls .",
    "our main result is the following .",
    "we first describe a construction of a one - way infinite `` bridge '' in the plane , due to brczky @xcite .",
    "we follow closely pach and sharir s description in @xcite . for convenience of notation ,",
    "all of the discs for now are unit radius ; they can be rescaled as necessary later to fit in a box .",
    "first , the construction is symmetric about the @xmath18-axis , so we only describe discs with their centers on our above the axis .",
    "let @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , as in figure [ fig : bridge1 ] .",
    "let @xmath22 be strictly convex function defined for @xmath23 , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 let @xmath26 be the curve @xmath27 , and let @xmath28 , the unique sequence of distinct points on @xmath26 such that @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "now set @xmath31 to be the unique point to the right of @xmath32 such that @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "then set @xmath35 to be the point on the @xmath18-axis to the right of @xmath31 with @xmath36 .",
    "inductively define @xmath37 to be the point to the right of @xmath38 such that @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "similarly , set @xmath41 to be the point on the @xmath18-axis to the right of @xmath37 such that @xmath42 .",
    "the beginning of this construction is illustrated in the left side of figure [ fig : bridge2 ] .",
    "the details that the construction results in a well - defined , stable configuration ( except along the four discs on the left ) can be found in brczky s original paper @xcite .",
    "he needed a second idea to get a stable configuration and disprove fejer toth s conjecture .",
    "he constructed a junction where three of these bridges could meet and hold all the loose discs on the end in place .",
    "brczky s junction is shown in figure [ fig : bjunction ] .",
    "we first use a slight modification of brczky s bridge construction , due to pach and sharir @xcite . for @xmath43 , replace @xmath22 above by the strictly convex function @xmath44 we have @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , so the sequence no longer continues indefinitely . by the intermediate value theorem ,",
    "by varying @xmath11 we can insure that for any arbitrarily large @xmath47 , some @xmath48 is the last well - defined point , and its @xmath18-coordinate is one more than the @xmath18-coordinate of @xmath49 .",
    "then let @xmath50 be the vertical line through @xmath48 , as in figure [ fig : bridg2e ] , and complete the configuration using @xmath50 as a line of symmetry , as illustrated .",
    "this gives an arbitrarily long symmetric bridge .",
    "the second piece of our construction for the square is the corner `` junction '' piece in figure [ fig : junction ] .",
    "the construction is easily verified to exist .",
    "if the center of the bottom left disc has coordinates @xmath51 , then the remaining five discs in the bottom left quarter of the square have coordinates : @xmath52            then by taking four copies each of the junction and bridge , and arranging them so that they overlap along their shaded outermost disks , in figure [ fig : rigid ] , the resulting configuration is stable .     and @xmath53.,width=480 ]",
    "the configurations constructed in this article are stable , meaning that no single disc can move .",
    "this is important to know , particularly from the point of view of probability and statistical physics .",
    "but is it possible for several discs to move simultaneously ? given that one can continuously deform the strictly convex function @xmath22 in the main construction in section [ section : stable ] , and if one is careful preserve the combinatorial structure ( tangency graph ) , it would seem that there is a small amount of flexibility and that one can slightly perturb many disks at once .",
    "how much freedom is there , though ?",
    "in particular , is it possible to freely permute the discs ?",
    "the set of all configurations of @xmath0 hard discs in a unit box , @xmath10 , inherits a subspace topology from @xmath54 .",
    "persi diaconis points out in his survey article @xcite that , `` very , very little is known about the topology of these spaces . ''",
    "the question above about moving multiple discs simultaneously is most naturally phrased in terms of path components of @xmath10 .",
    "considering @xmath10 as a topological space allows us to ask many new questions , as well .",
    "for example , we could consider path components under various restrictions ( lipshitz , smooth , etc . ) . if @xmath1 is sufficiently small , it would seem that @xmath10 is not only path connected , but homotopy equivalent to the classical configuration space @xmath55 , a space well - studied in algebraic geometry and algebraic topology @xcite . what is the largest @xmath56 such that @xmath10 is homotopy equivalent to @xmath55 for @xmath57 ?",
    "one might guess that once @xmath1 is sufficiently small that @xmath10 is path connected , that if @xmath58 then @xmath59 is path connected as well . however , this is not the case .",
    "for example , the configuration in figure [ fig : rigid5 ] is stable , and in fact , it can be shown , that it is a single point component in @xmath10 .",
    "but for slightly larger radius , it would seem that @xmath10 is path connected .",
    "discs that illustrated non - monotonicity of the property `` path - connectedness . ''",
    "this configuration is an isolated point in @xmath10 , but for slightly larger radius , computer experiments suggest that @xmath60 is path connected.,width=240 ]    on the subject of non - monotonicity , we note the work of brightwell , hggstrm , and winkler , where hardcore and widom - rowlinson models are studied on graphs . in @xcite the property of having a unique gibbs measure , perhaps somewhat analogous to @xmath10 being path connected ,",
    "is shown to be non - monotone in the underlying parameter .",
    "the topological questions may be interesting for their own sake , but they may also have implications for understanding the statistical physics .",
    "for example , although we have showed that metropolis is not irreducible on this problem , even for reasonably small discs , some might complain that the stable configurations only comprise a set of measure zero in @xmath10 .",
    "suppose that one could show that @xmath10 is disconnected .",
    "then one can use a compactness argument to show that @xmath59 is still disconnected for some @xmath58 .",
    "in fact for some @xmath58 , @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the set of path components of @xmath63 .",
    "there is a natural inclusion map @xmath64 and every element of @xmath65 has positive measure in @xmath59 .",
    "for example , in figure [ fig : rigid5 ] , one can slightly shrink the discs , and there are still at least @xmath66 path components , each with small positive measure .",
    "other discrete geometry questions naturally arise .",
    "can an analogue of the construction in this article be carried out in higher dimensional cubes ?",
    "what about for an arbitrary smoothly bounded convex body in the plane ? ( the result of diaconis , et .",
    "al @xcite is much more general than we stated earlier .",
    "in particular , theorem [ irreducible ] holds for general convex domains with reasonably nice boundaries . )    the most important question in this area , from the point of view of statistical physics , is to give a mathematical explanation for the phase transition observed experimentally to occur when @xmath67 to prove that any phase transition occurs at all in the hard spheres model seems to be an open problem , although we note @xcite , where a a phase transition is proved to exist , in a similar model where the particles are nonconvex .",
    "the author thanks jackson gorham for pointing out the stable configuration in figure [ fig : rigid5 ] .",
