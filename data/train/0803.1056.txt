    "recently there has been a lot of effort going into the investigation of various quantum information inequalities . we shall present a unified view that will cover most of the already known results and add some more .",
    "the notion of metric adjusted skew information was introduced by the third author @xcite as a measure of quantum information generalizing the wigner - yanase - dyson skew informations @xcite .",
    "the metric adjusted skew information is a convex function on the manifold of states and also satisfies other requirements , suggested by wigner and yanase , for a measure of the information content of a state with respect to a conserved observable .",
    "these requirements include additivity with respect to the aggregation of isolated subsystems and time independence for an isolated system .",
    "one more requirement , super additivity , fails spectacularly @xcite for all the measures , including the wigner - yanase skew information .",
    "we introduce an order relation @xmath0 on the set of functions representing quantum fisher information that renders the set into a lattice with a maximal and a minimal element .",
    "the order relation induces an order relation on the set of metric adjusted skew informations that renders also this set into a lattice with the sld - information as maximal element .",
    "there is no minimal element .",
    "the wigner - yanase - dyson skew informations given by @xmath1[\\rho^{1-p},a]\\qquad 0<p<1\\ ] ] are shown to be increasing in the parameter @xmath2 with respect to this new order relation in the interval @xmath3 $ ] and decreasing in the interval @xmath4 there is thus maximum in the wigner - yanase skew information for @xmath5 more elementary , the function @xmath6 is increasing in @xmath7 $ ] and decreasing in @xmath8 for fixed @xmath9 and @xmath10      the metric adjusted skew information is defined by setting @xmath11 c(l_\\rho , r_\\rho)i[\\rho , a]\\ ] ] for every positive definite @xmath12 density matrix @xmath9 and every @xmath13 matrix @xmath14 the function @xmath15 of two variables is a so called regular morozova - chentsov function which may be written on the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an operator monotone function defined on the positive half - axis with @xmath18 satisfying the functional equation @xmath19 for @xmath20 the regularity condition means that @xmath21 the operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the commuting positive definite left- and right- multiplication operators by @xmath24 if we want to emphasize the dependence of the representing operator monotone function @xmath17 we may also denote the metric adjusted skew information by @xmath25 the metric adjusted skew information is thus proportional to the metric length , as measured by the quantum fisher information , of the commutator @xmath26 .",
    "$ ] in the case of the wigner - yanase - dyson information this proportionality was already noticed in @xcite .",
    "the constant is however important as it can be chosen such that the metric adjusted skew information coincides with the variance on pure states .",
    "we have tacitly extended the definition of the metric adjusted skew information to include the case where @xmath27 may not be self - adjoint .",
    "this does not directly make sense in physical applications , but it turns out to be a useful mathematical tool .",
    "the symmetry of @xmath15 implies that @xmath28 for self - adjoint @xmath27 and @xmath29 in particular , the metric adjusted skew information is convex in @xmath9 also for non self - adjoint `` observables '' .",
    "the basic quantum information inequality is given by @xmath30 where the symmetrized variance @xmath31 the inequality was stated and proved in @xcite for self - adjoint @xmath27 by noting that the metric adjusted skew information is a convex function in @xmath9 while the covariance is concave , and that the two measures coincide on pure states .",

    "* proposition 9.2 ) subsequently gave another proof .",
    "the inequality generalizes an earlier result by luo for the wigner - yanase skew information @xcite .",
    "since the symmetrized variance satisfies @xmath32 for self - adjoint @xmath27 and @xmath33 we immediately obtain the inequality ( [ basic quantum information inequality ] ) also for non self - adjoint @xmath14    the above observations effectively reduce the multi - dimensional versions of the quantum information inequalities given by a number of authors @xcite to the main inequality ( [ basic quantum information inequality ] ) .",
    "let @xmath34 be a tuple of ( possibly non self - adjoint ) matrices .",
    "we then obtain the inequality @xmath35 where @xmath36 c(l_\\rho , r_\\rho)i[\\rho , b]\\ ] ] and @xmath37 indeed , we only have to notice the identity @xmath38 for arbitrary complex numbers @xmath39 and the similar identity for the covariance matrix .",
    "this reduces the matrix version ( [ matrix inequality ] ) to the basic quantum information inequality ( [ basic quantum information inequality ] ) .",
    "in particular , we obtain the determinant inequality @xmath40 by the well known formula @xmath41 since the logarithm is operator monotone is increasing for any increasing function @xmath42 .",
    "this version has been coined the `` dynamic uncertainty principle '' .",
    "we introduce various methods to compare measures of quantum information for one observable .",
