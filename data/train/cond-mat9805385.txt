    "ising models with nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic and more distant antiferromagnetic interactions exhibit rich magnetic ordering@xcite .",
    "the competition between ferromagnetism and longer - range antiferromagnetism leads to different ordered states and an associated sequence of phase transitions as a function of these two interaction strengths .",
    "such models were originally formulated to help describe the complex magnetism of the rare earths@xcite .",
    "their unusual magnetic ordering is believed to arise from the rkky interaction@xcite , in which the exchange interaction between localized magnetic moments oscillates between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic as a function of their separation .",
    "some of the essential consequences of this complex situation seem to be captured by ising models with competing interactions .",
    "one of the simplest versions is the axial next - nearest - neighbor ising ( annni ) model in which there is an isotropic nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic interaction and a next - nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic interaction along a single axis@xcite . even in one dimension ,",
    "this system exhibits non - trivial magnetic properties . for a weak antiferromagnetic interaction ,",
    "the ground state is ferromagnetic , while for a strong antiferromagnetic interaction there is an `` antiphase '' ground state which consists of 2 spins up , followed by 2 spins down , _",
    "etc_. for a specific ratio of these two interactions , an infinitely degenerate ground state arises in which each spin domain is of length 2 or greater@xcite .",
    "given the very different natures of these ground states , one might expect that dynamical behavior is also strongly affected by such competing interactions .",
    "our goal is to understand the kinetics of an ising chain with nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic interaction @xmath5 and @xmath0-neighbor antiferromagnetic interaction @xmath6 , when the system is also endowed with single spin - flip glauber dynamics .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath7 for @xmath8 , the ground state is a sequence of @xmath1 consecutive up spins followed by @xmath1 down spins , _",
    "etc_. our basic result is that for @xmath9 the asymptotic approach of the system to this alternating ground state can be described in terms of a reactive gas of elementary excitations .",
    "the rate limiting step of the coarsening is governed by the @xmath3-particle annihilation of the dominant excitations , which implies that the system coarsens in time as @xmath4 .    to provide a context for this work ,",
    "let us recall the well - known example of zero - temperature ( @xmath10 ) coarsening in the ising - glauber chain with nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic interactions only@xcite .",
    "spin flips inside ferromagnetic domains are forbidden at @xmath10 because they cost energy , while spins at the domain interfaces can flip freely , as indicated by @xmath11 since no energy cost is involved .",
    "this spin flip is equivalent to the hopping of a domain wall `` excitation '' which lies between the neighboring misaligned spins .",
    "two domain walls can annihilate when they meet , a process which leads to a reduction of the energy in the system . in terms of the spins ,",
    "the annihilation is equivalent to a domain which shrinks to zero size via the process @xmath12 this correspondence between the ferromagnetic ising - glauber chain and a gas of domain walls which undergo nearest - neighbor hopping and single - species two - particle annihilation provides a simple way to understand the @xmath13 coarsening dynamics of the spin system@xcite . in the following sections we show that the ising - glauber chain with competing interactions can be understood through a similar picture of reactive excitations .",
    "let us now study the ising - glauber chain with competing interactions at @xmath10 . to be concrete , consider first the case @xmath15 , _",
    "i.e. _ , a near - neighbor ferromagnetic interaction @xmath5 and a second - neighbor antiferromagnetic interaction @xmath16 .",
    "we focus on the case of strong antiferromagnetic interaction , @xmath14 , as this is the case which leads to interesting dynamics . starting from an initial ferromagnetically",
    "ordered up state for simplicity , this system evolves to the @xmath17 ground state by a two - stage process .",
    "first , there is an initial nucleation of down domains within regions of up spins . within a ferromagnetically",
    "ordered region , there is an energy loss @xmath18 when a single spin flips to create an isolated down spin .",
    "this same energy loss arises for any nucleation event which occurs within a domain of length @xmath19 when the flipped spin is at least two lattice spacings from both domain walls . after this nucleation",
    ", the single - spin domain can grow to length 2 with an energy loss @xmath20 as long as the length of the neighboring domain into which this inflation occurs is greater than 2 . at the end of this nucleation stage , therefore , the system consists of ordered @xmath21 regions , as well as domains of size 1 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "further , domains of size unity exist only if both neighboring domains are of length 2 .",
    "these remaining domains now undergo a sequence of reactions which ultimately leads to the system reaching the ground state . to determine this evolution , first consider an isolated 3-domain within an otherwise stable array to 2-domains .",
    "since the spin on either edge of the 3-domain can flip without energy cost , the 3-domain can hop isotropically by two lattice sites , as indicated by @xmath22 similarly , an isolated 1-domain within a sea of 2-domains also diffuses freely , since either neighboring spin of the 1-domain can flip with no energy cost , as indicated by @xmath23 these freely diffusing 1- and 3-domains are the elementary excitations of the system .    to appreciate the consequences of this statement , consider an isolated 4-domain within an otherwise stable array of 2-domains . since there is an energy cost associated with flipping either spin in the interior of a 4-domain ,",
    "this process does not occur at zero temperature .",
    "if , however , either spin at the end of the 4-domain flips , for example , @xmath24 then the configuration becomes two adjacent 3-domains within the stable sea of 2-domains .",
    "each of these 3 domains can then diffuse freely ; the first step of this process is indicated by @xmath25 one can thus regard an isolated 4-domain as a @xmath26 $ ] resonant state which is formed whenever two 3-domains collide .",
    "this resonance is short - lived , however , since its binding energy is zero .    continuing this reasoning , consider the evolution of a @xmath27 pair within a stable sea of 2 s . since both the 3 and 4 diffuse freely , these two excitations could move apart with zero energy cost . on the other hand ,",
    "the 3-domain can shrink and the 4-domain can grow to size 5 , also with zero energy cost . if this occurs , the 5 is unstable to the nucleation event : @xmath28 . due to the fact that the 4 can be viewed as a @xmath26 $ ] resonance ,",
    "the penultimate stoichiometry of this process is @xmath29 , _",
    "i.e. _ , 3 s annihilate through triple collisions .    finally consider how isolated 1 s evolve . since 1 s diffuse freely they react only upon meeting another 1 or a 3 . in the former collision ,",
    "a 4 is formed , @xmath30 with an associated energy loss @xmath31 . because the 4 is equivalent to a pair of 3 s , the penultimate stoichiometry of this process is @xmath32 .",
    "finally if a 1 meets a 3 , they react to form a stable pair of 2 s , @xmath33 with an associated energy loss @xmath20 .",
    "this can be viewed as the two - species annihilation process @xmath34 , since the pair of 2 s that are formed become part of the stable ground state .",
    "the underlying stoichiometry of these processes can therefore be summarized by the three reactions @xmath35 since each of these processes leads to a loss of energy , they each occur at the same rate when @xmath10 .",
    "the overall effect of these reactions is that the density of these elementary excitations ultimately vanish .",
    "let us now determine the time dependence for the densities of these excitations in the mean - field limit .",
    "using @xmath36 to denote both domains of length 3 and their density , and similarly using @xmath37 for 1 s , the rate equations associated with the reaction scheme ( [ summ ] ) are @xmath38 a naive qualitative analysis of these equations indicates that @xmath36 s are asymptotically dominant . thus using @xmath39 ,",
    "the above rate equations simplify to @xmath40 subtracting eq .",
    "( [ nreb ] ) from ( [ nrea ] ) gives @xmath41 .",
    "given @xmath39 , we neglect @xmath42 to give the closed equation @xmath43 . comparing with eq .",

    "this implies @xmath45 , which agrees with @xmath46 .",
    "the end results of these considerations are @xmath47 which are confirmed by numerical integration of the rate equations .",
    "let us now adapt the rate equations to the case of one dimension . quite generally , we write @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the rate at which @xmath36 s disappear due to the triple collisions and @xmath50 is the rate at which both @xmath36 s and @xmath37 s disappear due to their mutual annihilation .",
    "these equations are at the same level of approximation as eqs .",
    "( [ nrea ] ) and ( [ nreb ] ) , as we again neglect the effect of interactions between two @xmath37 s .",
    "the rate @xmath49 can be shown to scale as @xmath51@xcite .",
    "the cubic term is just the mean - field rate of triple collisions between @xmath36 s , and the logarithmic correction arises because one dimension is the critical dimension for the three - particle reaction - diffusion processes@xcite .",
    "this reaction rate gives the rate equation @xmath52 for three - particle annihilation .",
    "this gives the asymptotic behavior for the density @xmath53 , which agrees with previous numerical and theoretical treatments@xcite .",
    "the two - species annihilation rate @xmath50 can be estimated as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the reaction time for an @xmath36 and a @xmath37 to meet by diffusion .",
    "this reaction time is proportional to the square of the distance between a @xmath37 and its nearest @xmath36 ; therefore , @xmath56 which gives @xmath57 .",
    "subtracting eq .",
    "( [ reonedb ] ) from ( [ reoneda ] ) gives @xmath58 .",
    "since we again anticipate that @xmath39 , we ignore @xmath42 to obtain @xmath59 .",
    "this relation implies that triple collisions are the dominant kinetic mechanism for elimination of @xmath36 s so that this density decays as in three - particle annihilation .",
    "the factor of 4 in @xmath60 indicates that four @xmath36 s eventually disappear after a triple collision  three particles are eliminated in the process @xmath61 , and then the newly - formed @xmath37 will eliminate another @xmath36 . to determine @xmath62 , note that eq .",
    "( [ reoneda ] ) , together with @xmath59 , imply that @xmath63 ; that is , the gain and loss terms in eq .",
    "( [ reonedb ] ) cancel .",
    "the relation @xmath64 can be rewritten as @xmath65 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the density of elementary excitations are @xmath66    = 2.5in=2.5 in 0.3 in 0.15 in    monte carlo simulations of the @xmath10 ising - glauber chain yield results which are qualitatively consistent with these predictions . as shown in fig .  1 , the densities of the various elementary excitations decay at different temporal rates .",
    "over the last 2 decades of data , linear least - squares fits give 0.56 and 0.40 for the exponent associated with the density of 1 s and 3 s , respectively . however , there is considerable curvature in the data and the linear fit is not indicative of the asymptotic behavior .",
    "in fact , the data for the density of 1 s is curved upward while that for the density of 3 s is curved downward ; these are suggestive of an asymptotic exponent of 1/2 . however , a serious quantitative test of eqs .",
    "( [ ab ] ) would require extensive simulation , since the corrections to the local exponents will vanish only as @xmath67 .",
    "we thus interpret the data as being consistent with ( [ ab ] ) .",
    "similar least - squares fits give exponents for the density of 4 s and 5 s as 0.84 and 1.42 . in this case , both sets of data exhibit downward curvature .",
    "these two features are qualitatively consistent with the hypothesis that 4 s and 5 s are equivalent to @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath68 $ ] resonances , respectively , so that their densities should scale as @xmath69 and @xmath51 .    to provide an additional insight into the basic nature of this coarsening process it is worthwhile to consider the case @xmath70 , where the chain breaks up into two independent antiferromagnetic sublattices .",
    "for each sublattice , the dynamics must coincide with the usual @xmath13 glauber coarsening .",
    "it is instructive to see how this behavior arises within our picture of elementary excitations .",
    "the crucial feature for the case @xmath70 is that the process @xmath71 now involves no energy change ( see eq .",
    "( [ summ ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , the reverse process @xmath72 occurs freely .",
    "the presence of this additional process now gives the rate equations @xmath73 the cubic term turns out to be negligible and the resulting asymptotic behavior is @xmath74 .",
    "similarly , for the one - dimensional system , the density of 1 s and 3 s become identical and both decay as @xmath13 .",
    "the presence of this additional reaction process and the corresponding change in the dominant terms in the rate equations shows clearly that the dynamics of the ising - glauber chain with competing interactions is in a different universality class than that of the purely antiferromagnetic spin chain .      to complete the discussion of the ising - glauber chain with competing interactions ,",
    "let us extend the considerations discussed above to @xmath76 .",
    "for @xmath77 , the basic new dynamical feature is that nucleation of isolated domains in energetically forbidden at @xmath10 .",
    "further , any 1 s in the initial population of elementary excitations quickly disappear through the annihilation processes @xmath71 and @xmath34 .",
    "however 3 s saturate at a finite density , as there is no mechanism for their removal .",
    "resonances such as @xmath26 $ ] , @xmath68 $ ] , _ etc .",
    "_ , form freely by collisions between 3 s",
    ". however , high - order resonances can not decay by nucleation but merely re - fragment into lower - order resonances .",
    "in the case of @xmath78 , domain walls become the basic excitations , as in the ferromagnetic ising - glauber chain .",
    "however , domain walls repel since there is an energy cost @xmath79 to bring two domain walls closer than two lattice spacings apart .",
    "interestingly , for all @xmath77 , the equilibrium ground state can not be reached via single spin - flip glauber dynamics . for @xmath80 , the alternating @xmath81 ground state",
    "can not be attained because there is no mechanism for domains of length @xmath82 to break up ; for @xmath78 , the ferromagnetic ground state can not be attained because of the repulsion of domain walls .",
    "the situations where @xmath83 and @xmath84 exhibit additional new dynamical features and each requires a separate treatment . in the former case , an arbitrary array of domains which all have lengths @xmath85 forms a ground state@xcite .",
    "the glauber single spin - flip dynamics now has the following geometrical manifestations .",
    "first , it is energetically favorable for isolated 1-domains to disappear by `` anti - nucleation '' .",
    "second , domain walls can diffuse freely as long as they are more than two lattice spacings apart .",
    "they repel each other with infinite strength at zero temperature , so they can not annihilate .",
    "most interesting is the dynamical behavior of strings of consecutive antiferromagnetic spins . in this case",
    ", the flipping of a single spin gives rise to a 3-domain .",
    "this can be viewed as the replacement of the triplet of antiferromagnetic spins by a ferromagnetic `` trimer '' .",
    "this replacement process of 3 spins by a trimer can continue inside an initially antiferromagnetic region until it is converted into a ferromagnetic domain .",
    "this dynamics is therefore equivalent to the random sequential adsorption of trimers which can overlap .",
    "the dynamics of this adsorption process can be solved according to well - known procedures@xcite .",
    "let @xmath86 denote the probability that exactly @xmath1 consecutive sites are occupied by 1-domains , that is , an antiferromagnetically ordered string of length @xmath1 .",
    "the probabilities @xmath86 evolve according to the rate equations @xmath87 the loss term arises because the adsorption of a trimer whose center coincides with any of the @xmath1 sites of the string or the two sites adjacent to the string destroys the @xmath1-string .",
    "similarly , the gain term arises from processes in which the adsorption of a trimer onto a larger string leads to the creation of an @xmath1-string .    to solve the rate equations , note that the ansatz @xmath88 transforms the infinite set of differential equations ( [ rsa ] ) into the pair of equations @xmath89 consider now an initially disordered ising chain ( corresponding to a quench from @xmath90 to @xmath10 ) .",
    "an antiferromagnetic string of length @xmath1 occurs with probability @xmath91 , which implies @xmath92 solving eqs .",
    "( [ ff ] ) subject to ( [ initial ] ) yields @xmath93.\\label{f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore domain walls inside antiferromagnetic strings quickly disappear and the total density of domain walls reaches a saturation level . since the subsequent dynamics does not allow for processes which change the number of domain walls , the system continues to explore a sector of the phase space that contains all ground states with the same number of domain walls .",
    "the system falls into its asymptotic sector exponentially in time .",
    "different sectors are mutually disconnected , and the sector eventually reached by the system depends on initial conditions .",
    "the dependence on initial conditions and exponential relaxation are outcomes of the lack of ergodicity in the glauber dynamics of the ising model with competing interactions when @xmath83 .    consider finally the marginal case @xmath84 .",
    "the crucial difference with the case of strong antiferromagnetism , @xmath14 , is that the process @xmath29 now involves no energy gain and thus the reverse process @xmath94 can also occur freely .",
    "the rate equations ( [ reoneda ] ) and ( [ reonedb ] ) are thus modified to @xmath95 to determine the asymptotic behavior , it proves convenient to transform these equations to @xmath96 we now ignore @xmath42 on the left - hand sides .",

    "( [ rbb ] ) gives @xmath97 .",
    "this implies @xmath98 , so that eq .",
    "( [ raa ] ) now gives @xmath99 , or @xmath100 .",
    "we therefore conclude that when @xmath84 the density of elementary excitations are @xmath101 thus in the marginal case of @xmath84 , the ising - glauber chain still coarsens , but at a much slower rate than in the case of strong antiferromagnetism , @xmath14 .",
    "our general approach can naturally be applied to longer range antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "we first outline basic features of coarsening for an antiferromagnetic third - neighbor interaction ; the behavior for arbitrary range antiferromagnetic interaction follows inductively .",
    "the hamiltonian now is @xmath102 and for sufficiently strong antiferromagnetic interaction the ground state consists of alternating domains of length 3 , @xmath103 .",
    "starting from the ferromagnetic up state , the evolution to the ground state again proceeds by a two - stage process when @xmath104 . while the ground state occurs when @xmath105 , we shall employ the stronger inequality @xmath104 in the following to guarantee that this ground state is accessible via single spin - flip glauber dynamics .    in the initial nucleation stage",
    ", it is energetically favorable for a spin within an large up domain to flip if this spin is three or more lattice spacings from any domain boundary .",
    "thus domains of length @xmath106 are unstable to such nucleation events .",
    "it is also energetically favorable for this isolated down spin domain to grow to size 3 , as long as the expanding domain wall remains at least 3 lattice spacings from adjacent domain walls . at the end of the nucleation stage , therefore , all domains have length @xmath107 .",
    "further , domains of length 1 or 2 must be surrounded by domains of length 3 ; otherwise the central domain would expand until its size reached 3 .",
    "a basic observation is that the true elementary excitations are domains of length 2 and of length 4 , as these are the only objects which diffuse freely within a stable sea of 3 s .",
    "all other defects are resonant states of these two elementary excitations . to determine the nature of the coarsening , first consider the resonances of 4-domains .",
    "for example , a 5-domain is formed when two 4 s meet and interact , so that one 4 shrinks to length 3 , while the other grows to length 5 .",
    "there is no energy cost associated with this process , so that a 5-domain can be viewed as a @xmath108 $ ] resonance .",
    "similarly , a 6-domain is a @xmath109 $ ] , or equivalently a @xmath110 $ ] resonance .",
    "finally , a 7-domain may be produced by the conversion of @xmath111 ; thus the 7 is a @xmath112 $ ] resonance . at the center of the 7-domain",
    ", a single spin can flip , thereby nucleating a 1-domain and two surrounding stable 3 domains .",
    "the penultimate stoichiometry of this process is therefore , @xmath113 .",
    "conversely , consider the resonances and interactions associated with 2-domains .",
    "when two 2 s , within a stable sea of 3 s , meet , a 1-domain is formed as indicated by @xmath114 since there is no energy cost associated with this process , a 1-domain is simply a @xmath115 $ ] resonance .",
    "when three 2 s meet , there are several possible zero - energy - cost outcomes .",
    "if the interior spin of the outer 2-domain flips , then the result is @xmath116 .",
    "since the 1-domain is a @xmath115 $ ] resonance , this process can be considered as the first step in separating the three initial domains . however , if one of the spins in the middle domain flips , then the outcome is @xmath117 .",
    "once a @xmath118 state is reached , it is energetically favorable for the central isolated spin to flip thus giving @xmath119 , _ i.e. _ , a @xmath110 $ ] resonance .",
    "this last step is accompanied by the energy loss @xmath120 .",
    "the outcome of more than three 2 s meeting can be obtained by grouping the 2 s into triplets and analyzing the outcome of each triplet in series . finally , when a 2 and a 4 meet , it is energetically favorable for @xmath121 and @xmath122",
    ". this can be viewed as the two - species annihilation @xmath123 , since the two 3 s formed in the reaction belong to the stable ground state .    from these basic processes ,",
    "the governing reactions for this system are @xmath124 for these reactions , the associated rate equations for the density of 4 s @xmath125 and 2 s @xmath126 are @xmath127 the structure of these equations is similar to the second - neighbor interaction case . following the same reasoning as used previously , we find @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "similarly , we may adapt the rate equation above to describe the system in one dimension by following the approach used to write eqs .",
    "( [ reoneda ] ) and ( [ reonedb ] ) .",
    "this leads to @xmath130 with the asymptotic behavior @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",

    "over the last 2 decades of data , linear least - squares fits give 0.80 and 0.25 for the exponent associated with the density of 2 s and 4 s , respectively .",
    "once again , the sense of the curvature in these two data sets is consistent with the respective asymptotic exponents of 1/3 and 2/3 .",

    "we merely point out that our picture of elementary excitations allows one to express all densities in terms of the density of 4 s .",

    "this is only marginally consistent with the data , a feature which we attribute to slow approach to asymptotic behavior .",
    "finally , we may apply a similar geometrical picture of elementary excitations to treat the general case of the ising - glauber chain with competing first- and @xmath0-neighbor interactions when @xmath9 . in this case , the basic excitations are domains of @xmath2 spins ( @xmath36 ) and domains of @xmath135 spins ( @xmath37 ) , each of which diffuses freely within a stable ground state sea of alternating ferromagnetic strings of length @xmath1 .",
    "other types of excitations are resonances of these elementary excitations .",

    "consequently , the ground state is approached as @xmath4 and the densities of the basic excitations decay according to @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",

    "the case of the competing interaction , however , is amenable to an intuitively appealing description in terms of elementary excitations which makes clear the mechanism for the new types of coarsening kinetics .",
    "it is intriguing that the nature of the elementary excitations and the spectrum of resonances of the system are not obviously connected with the microscopic interaction of the spin system .    for general @xmath0-neighbor antiferromagnetic interaction ,",

    "the marginal case @xmath140 admits additional microscopic processes which leads to even slower coarsening .",
