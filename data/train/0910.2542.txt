    "neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath0 ) is the only experiment that can probe the majorana nature of the neutrino .",
    "@xmath0 is a @xmath3 lepton number violating decay that can occur if the neutrino is a majorana particle . for an introduction see for instance @xcite .",
    "the generic effective majorana mass term can be write as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the standard model higgs doublet and @xmath6 is an effective scale . when @xmath5 takes a vev @xmath7 , the operator in eq.([l5d ] ) gives the majorana mass term @xmath8 .",
    "in general @xmath9 is an arbitrary 3 by 3 symmetric complex matrix .",
    "it has been observed @xcite that neutrino data are in very good agreement with zero a rector angle @xmath10 , maximal atmospheric angle @xmath11 and large but not maximal solar angle @xmath12 .",
    "a leptonic mixing mixing matrix with such a values is called tri - bimaximal ( tbm ) .",
    "the most generic neutrino mass matrix yielding to tbm mixing is invariant under exchanged the second family with the third family ( @xmath13 symmetry ) and the sum of the elements each row of @xmath14 is constant , namely @xmath15 .",
    "we call a neutrino mass matrix of such type tri - bimaximal form mass matrix",
    ".    we can extend the standard model by means of a flavor symmetry @xmath16 that yields a tri - bimaximal form mass matrix .",
    "examples are the group of even permutation of four objects @xmath1 @xcite or the group of all the permutation of four objects @xmath2 @xcite . we observe that @xmath1 is the smallest non - abelian group with a triplet representation allowing to arrange in one multiplet the three families . for now on we focus on @xmath1 flavor symmetry .",
    "we assume three higgs doublets transforming as a triplet @xmath17 and the lepton doublets @xmath18 , transforming as a triplet of @xmath1 .",
    "the most generic @xmath1 invariant dimension five operators are given as @xmath19 the resulting neutrino mass matrix is of tri - bimaximal form if and only if @xmath20 .",
    "such a condition can naturally be explained by adding higgs doublets or flavons carrying extra abelian symmetries , see for instance @xcite .",
    "differently the most generic @xmath2 invariant dimension five operators @xmath21 give neutrino mass matrix of tri - bimaximal form .",
    "in @xmath2 we do not need to introduce extra scalars or add symmetries in order to have tri - bimaximal in the neutrino sector .",
    "the resulting neutrino mass matrix is diagonalized by the tri - bimaximal matrix .",
    "now we study the theoretical implications for @xmath0 in models based on the two flavor groups @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the allowed ranges of @xmath22 as a function of the lightest neutrino are presented in figures([label1])and([label2 ] ) .",
    "the two bands correspond to the normal hierarchy and the inverse hierarchy with @xmath12 , @xmath11 , @xmath23 ( tri - bimaximal ) .",
    "we call this bands the _ tri - bimaximal region _ for @xmath24 .",
    "5.mm allowed range of @xmath22 as a function of the lightest neutrino mass for @xmath2 based model.,title=\"fig : \" ]    5.mm allowed range of @xmath22 as a function of the lightest neutrino mass for @xmath2 based model.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in order to simplify the discussion and to show the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath2 based models , we assume @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this could be the case if the dimension five operators arise from type - ii seesaw mechanism only .",
    "we have already said that @xmath1 gives tri - bimaximal mixing if @xmath20 .    if @xmath27 @xmath1 and @xmath2 are phenomenologically equivalent since the operators proportional to @xmath28 and @xmath29 correspond to the operators proportional to @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .    if @xmath32 , then @xmath1 and @xmath2 are not phenomenologically equivalent .",
    "for instance the @xmath2 allowed range for @xmath22 is the full tri - bimaximal region .",
    "when @xmath33 the allowed @xmath22 ranges for @xmath1 and @xmath2 are given respectively in figures([label1])and([label2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , in figure([label1 ] ) we see that @xmath1 is compatible only with normal hierarchy .",
    "the @xmath1 case has a lower bound with @xmath34 , see @xcite . in figure([label2 ] ) we see that @xmath2 is compatible only with inverse hierarchy .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have studied @xmath24 implications assuming respectively type - i and inverse / linear seesaw mechanisms with @xmath1 flavor symmetry .",
    "an effective neutrino mass model with @xmath2 flavor symmetry has been studied in @xcite . in @xcite a model with type - i seesaw with @xmath2 flavor symmetry has been studied .",
    "note that for values of the lightest mass bigger than @xmath35 ev , namely when neutrino are quasi degenerate , @xmath1 and @xmath2 allowed ranges are well separated",
    ". therefore it could be in principle possible to distinguish @xmath1 from @xmath2 in the quasi degenerate region .",
    "2.mm    in case of inverse hierarchy there is a lower limit for @xmath22 . in @xcite",
    "the dependence of such a limit as a function of the solar angle has been studied . however , in case of normal hierarchy in general there is no lower limit . if @xmath36 we have that the lower limit depends from the values of the solar and reactor angles , @xmath37 this equation gives a relation between the solar and the reactor angles and the allowed region is represented in figure([label3 ] ) with the blue band .",
    "the small red region is the range allowed by the data at @xmath38 and compatible with @xmath36 , namely eq.([b1 ] ) .",
