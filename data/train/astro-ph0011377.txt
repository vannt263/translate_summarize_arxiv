    "the large fields - of - view ( fovs ) typical of x - ray imaging instruments have long been exploited for serendipitous surveys , resulting in far - reaching and fundamental advances in our knowledge of the x - ray universe and indeed the universe as a whole ( _ e.g. _ , the einstein medium sensitivity survey ( emss , stocke et al . 1991 , maccacaro et al . 1982 ) ; the cambridge - cambridge rosat serendipitous survey ( ccrss , boyle , wilkes & elvis 1997 ) ; rosat international x - ray / optical survey ( rixos , page et al . 1996 ) ) .",
    "the next decade promises to be rich for x - ray astronomy as two major observatories , chandra and xmm , open new vistas with their deeper flux limits and superior spatial and spectral resolution .",
    "-2.0 in 3.0 in    0.85 in    to take full advantage of the rich serendipitous dataset afforded by chandra s large fovs ( acis - i : 16@xmath8 ) and to maximize the science per ksec of observing time , we have organized an extragalactic serendipitous x - ray survey , the champ and a similar galactic plane survey ( champlane ) .",
    "we estimate a champ x - ray sample of @xmath9 sources in the @xmath10 sq .",
    "degs . of champ fields in cycle-1 .",
    "@xmath7% of these are likely to be agn of various types , including those with low luminosity and/or substantial low energy x - ray absorption expected based on the spectrum of the cxrb and already being found in early results from chandra surveys ( hornschemeier et al .",
    "2000 , mushotzky et al .",
    "2000 , barger et al .",
    "2000 , giacconi et al .",
    "the remaining sources will include clusters of galaxies , stars , x - ray binaries , and supernova remnants .",
    "unlike targeted , small area , deep chandra surveys , which reach fainter flux levels , the champ provides the wide area essential for finding rare , bright and/or unexpected sources , generating statistically meaningful samples of rare source types such as bl lac objects , quiescent x - ray binaries and high - redshift clusters .",
    "as such the champ complements existing deep chandra surveys ( figure  1 ) .",
    "of prime importance in carrying out any survey is an accurate understanding of the selection effects present .",
    "we have defined a subset of chandra fields to minimize bias due to the effects of known extended sources and to include a variety of target types .",
    "each field will be analyzed as it becomes available in the archive using uniform x - ray source detection and analysis techniques ( section  2.2 ) resulting in a well - defined x - ray sample over the full survey area .",
    "the 172 fields in the champ extragalactic cycle-1 and cycle-2 lists have @xmath11 .",
    "we exclude targeted survey fields , _",
    "e.g. _ hubble deep field , lockman hole ( being studied optically by their chandra pis ) ; special instrument modes ( _ e.g. _ , grating observations , acis sub - arrays ) ; unstable detector periods ; @xmath12 acis chips and fields containing bright optical or x - ray sources covering @xmath13% of the chandra fov on the dss optical or rosat / other x - ray images .",
    "we are currently refining our source detection procedures using two methods : sliding cell search and wavelet transformation ; the former is optimized for point source detection while the latter provides efficient detection of diffuse / extended sources and those in crowded fields .",
    "the chandra point - spread - function ( psf ) is a strong function of off - axis angle and energy",
    "so we are carrying out simulations of source detection efficiency as a function of size , off - axis angle , background characteristics , source spectrum etc . to understand survey limits and minimize false sources while optimizing source detection .",
    "x - ray source properties will be derived for sources in the master ( merged ) list including : accurate positions , count rates and fluxes , spatial extent , variability and spectrum / hardness ratio when possible given the source signal .",
    "acis sources with 100 counts will constrain simple power law fits to within 25% , 30 counts provide hardness ratios adequate to distinguish between the high energy spectra of agn and typically softer stellar sources and to provide an estimate of the soft x - ray absorption . our  estimates suggest @xmath14 agn per year will yield useful hardness ratios , and @xmath15 will furnish enough counts for a spectrum .",
    "-2.0 in 3.4 in    0.6 in      the second essential ingredient for an x - ray survey , which opens up a much wider range of scientific questions , is optical identification of the x - ray sources .",
    "we are obtaining optical images of the champ fields using the same filters with matched flux limits :   @xmath16 designed to identify @xmath1790% of the normal agn population and automatically includes larger fractions of other known source types .",
    "this is very efficient , observing all the x - ray sources in one chandra field at one time , minimizing the large , ground - based telescope time required to reach the faint optical limiting magnitudes ( 21v25 , with mode of 24 ) .",
    "the choice of filters , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) g@xmath18,r@xmath18,i@xmath18 , provides direct benefit from the sdss photometric / spectroscopic database and simulations at brighter limits , allowing excellent photometric classification and redshift determination ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "1998 ) , invaluable at the faintest optical fluxes . to date",
    "we have observed 41 champ fields in 31 observing nights ( 9 nights:4-m kpno ( kitt peak national observatory ) , 6:0.9 m kpno , 3:4 m ctio ( cerro tololo inter - american observatory ) , 17:1.2 m sao ) .",
    "the uniformity of the dataset and our analysis methods will provide a well - understood and highly uniform sample .",
    "chandra s small psf and unprecendented , for x - ray telescopes , astrometric calibration minimize the number of possible optical counterparts per x - ray source .",
    "we are developing procedures to reduce and analyze the optical images , derive source lists and cross - correlate ( solving for aspect differences ) , to identify the x - ray sources . in figure",
    "2 we show preliminary results for a 110 ksec acis - i observation based on a preliminary 900 sec i@xmath18-band image taken with the 4-shooter ccd imager on the sao 1.2 m telescope , 12 feb 2000 .",
    "the flux limit , i@xmath19 , is @xmath20 brighter than the champ required limit .",
    "the 165 detected x - ray sources found using the ciao ( chandra interactive analysis of observations ) _ wavdetect _ tool and those with optical identifications @xmath21of the x - ray centroid .",
    "we will determine upper limits in optical / x - ray as appropriate for sources not detected in both bands .",
    "sources will be classified using x - ray size , optical and x - ray colors employing color - color plane methods ( newberg et al .",
    "1999 ) .      we will release a list of x - ray sources and their properties along with optical images and source lists in to a web - based public archive",
    "( the x - ray data will be available via the chandra public archive ) .",
    "the champ database will provide an invaluable , multi - wavelength database to the community , helping to ensure that the science return from chandra reaches its full potential .",
    "champlane selected 15 fields in cycle-1 such that @xmath22 and exposure time @xmath23 ksecs .",
    "the x - ray data analysis is being carried out in close collaboration with the champ ( section  2.2 ) . however optical imaging in r and h@xmath24 filters is aimed at optimizing the identification of cvs and qlmxbs , primarily black hole x - ray novae in quiescence , in order to constrain and ultimately measure their luminosity functions .",
    "secondary objectives are to determine the be x - ray binary content and stellar coronal source distributions in the galaxy .",
    "the deep chandra galactic fields will detect 2 - 6 kev fluxes ( allowing for low energy absorption ) of f@xmath25(2 - 6 kev ) = 2 @xmath26 erg s@xmath27 and thus cvs or qlmxbs with l@xmath25 = 10@xmath28 erg s@xmath5 out to @xmath67 kpc .",
    "thus most cvs and qlmxbs in the galaxy can be reached , and the champlane survey offers the best chance for constraining their formation / evolution and the stellar bh content of the galaxy .",
    "cvs and qlmxbs will be identified by their ubiquitous h@xmath24 excess as `` blue '' objects in the r vs. ( h@xmath24 - r ) plane down to r @xmath6 24 .",
    "we have demonstrated this technique for crowded fields with our hst discovery of the first cvs in globular cluster cores and have now conducted a successful pilot champlane survey at ctio .",
    "champlane has been awarded 31 4-m nights of observing time at kpno and ctio as part of the noao survey program .",
    "we have generated a preliminary  from the ciao _ wavdetect _ list of 165 background x - ray sources in the ms1137.5 + 6625 field and the 127 sources in the field of the cluster : cl 0848.6 + 4453 .",
    "our results , which assume a power law with = 1.0 , ( figure  3 ) agree well with those from rosat ( hasinger et al . 1998 ) and extend to fainter fluxes .",
    "we plan to take advantage of the new generation of large area , multi - object spectrographs to efficiently obtain spectra and provide redshifts for a subset of @xmath29 sources , sufficient to constrain to @xmath30% the points on agn luminosity functions ( lf ) for 0@xmath31z@xmath314 .",
    "currently available instruments ( _ e.g. _ the 6.5 m mmt , on which we have 10 nights per year ) limit to v22 but we plan to expand our sample beyond this once the new generation of large telescopes come on - line .",
    "initial spectra were obtained the low - resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ) on the keck telescope in director s discretionary time , 29 april 2000 .",
    "slitlets were placed at the positions of the closest optical couterparts to 12 x - ray soruces in a region of the ms1137.7@xmath326625 field several of which had a low probability due to the large separation .",
    "the resulting 3600sec spectra revealed 3 stars , 5 qsos , 2 early - type galaxies , a narrow emission line galaxy ( nelg ) , and one mystery object with very smooth continuum ( star / bl lac ? ) .",
    "four of the spectra : 3 qsos and 1 galaxy are presented in figure  4 ."
