    "in the last century the fundamental discoveries of nuclear physics have led to the understanding of the thermonuclear energy source of main sequence stars and explained the basic physical processes underlying the solar luminosity ( see e.g. m. schwarzschild @xcite ) .    the discovery of pulsars in 1968 ( see hewish et al .",
    "@xcite ) led to the first evidence for the existence of neutron stars , first described in terms of theoretical physics by george gamow as far back as 1936 @xcite .",
    "it became clear that the pulsed luminosity of pulsars , at times @xmath4 ",
    "@xmath5 larger than solar luminosity , was not related to nuclear burning and could be simply explained in term of the loss of rotational energy of a neutron star ( gold @xcite ) . for the first time it became so clear the possible relevance of strong gravitational fields in the energetics of an astrophysical system .",
    "the birth of x - ray astronomy thanks to riccardo giacconi and his group ( see e.g. giacconi and ruffini @xcite ) led to a still different energy source , originating from the accretion of matter onto a star which has undergone a complete gravitational collapse process : a black hole ( see e.g. ruffini & wheeler @xcite ) . in this case , the energetics is dominated by the radiation emitted in the accretion process of matter around an already formed black hole .",
    "luminosities up to @xmath2 times the solar luminosity , much larger then the ones of pulsars , could be explained by the release of energy in matter accreting in the deep potential well of a black hole ( leach and ruffini @xcite ) .",
    "this allowed to probe for the first time the structure of circular orbits around a black hole computed by ruffini and wheeler ( see e.g. landau and lifshitz @xcite ) .",
    "this result was well illustrated by the theoretical interpretation of the observations of cygnus - x1 , obtained by the uhuru satellite and by the optical and radio telescopes on the ground ( see fig . [ cygx1 ] ) .",
    "of @xmath2 solar luminosities points to the accretion process into a neutron star or a black hole as the energy source .",
    "the absence of pulsation is naturally explained either by a non - magnetized neutron star or a kerr - newmann black hole , which has necessarily to be axially symmetric .",
    "what identifies the black hole unambiguously is that the mass of cygnus x-1 , larger than @xmath6 , exceeds the absolute upper limit of the neutron star mass , estimated at @xmath7 by rhoades and ruffini @xcite . ]",
    "the discovery of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) sign a further decisive progress .",
    "the grbs give the first opportunity to probe and observe a yet different form of energy : the extractable energy of the black hole introduced in 1971 ( christodoulou and ruffini @xcite ) , which we shall refer in the following as the blackholic energy .",
    "the blackholic energy , expected to be emitted during the dynamical process of gravitational collapse leading to the formation of the black hole , generates x - ray luminosities @xmath8 times larger than the solar luminosity , although lasting for a very short time .",
    "the extreme regimes of grbs evidence new and unexplored regimes of theoretical physics .",
    "it is the aim of this talk to outline the progress achieved in understanding these astrophysical systems and the theoretically predicted regimes for the first time submitted to direct observational verification .",
    "it is a pleasure to present these results in brazil .",
    "while sitting at the casino de urca , george gamow and mario schoenberg in 1939 identified the basic process leading to the formation and cooling of a newly born neutron star ( see [ gamow ] ) .",
    "they called this process essentially related to the emission of neutrinos and antineutrinos the urca process .",
    "it is a welcomed coincidence that , during the preparation of my talk at the tenth marcel grossmann meeting @xcite , examining the data of the recently observed grb 030329 , we have received a confirmation of a scenario we have recently outlined in three papers giving the theoretical paradigms for the understanding of grbs ( ruffini et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we have clear evidence , first advanced in the system grb980425/sn1998bw ( ruffini et al .",
    "@xcite , fraschetti et al .",
    "@xcite ) and now confirmed also in the system grb030329/sn1003dh , that there are in these systems three different components : 1 ) the grb source , generated by the collapse to a black hole , 2 ) the supernova , generated by the collapse of an evolved star , 3 ) an additional x - ray source which is not related , unlike what is at times stated in the literature , to the grb afterglow . in honor of the work done in the town of urca by george gamow and mario schoenberg , identifying in the neutrino emission of the urca process the basic mechanism leading to the process of gravitational collapse and the formation of a relativistic compact star , we named these two x - ray sources urca-1 , the one formed in the system grb980425/sn1998bw , and urca-2 , the one formed in the system grb030329/sn2003dh . we shall now recall some of the main steps in reaching this understanding out of the grb phenomenon and explore possible explanation of the origin of these two sources .",
    "we then turn to the analysis of the short grbs .",
    "we first review some progress in the study of the general relativistic collapse of a shell of matter endowed with electromagnetic fields , which has been motivated by the study of the short grbs .",
    "we then deduce from these theoretical developments some consequences for the interpretation of the mass - energy formula of the black hole , as well as some conceptual consequences for the relation between general relativity and thermodynamics .",
    "we also apply some recent progress on the solution of the einstein - maxwell - blasov equations to the thermalization process occurring in the electron - positron plasma generated by the vacuum polarization process .",
    "we finally give a very specific theoretical prediction on the burst structure to be expected in short grbs .",
    "we then proceed to the conclusions and some general considerations about this novel astrophysical scenario .",
    "it is well known how grbs were detected and studied for the first time using the _ vela _ satellites , developed for military research to monitor the non - violation of the limited test ban treaty signed in 1963 ( see e.g. strong @xcite ) .",
    "it was clear from the early data of these satellites , which were put at @xmath9 miles from the surface of earth , that the grbs did not originate either on the earth nor in the solar system .",
    "the mystery of these sources became more profound as the observations of the batse instrument on board of the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) satellite over @xmath10 years proved the isotropy of these sources in the sky ( see fig .",
    "[ batse2k ] ) .",
    "in addition to these data , the cgro satellite gave an unprecedented number of details on the grb structure , on their spectral properties and time variabilities which became encoded in the fourth batse catalog @xcite ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ grb_profiles_eng ] ) . out of the analysis of these batse sources",
    "it soon became clear ( see e.g. kouveliotou et al .",
    "@xcite , tavani @xcite ) the existence of two distinct families of sources : the long bursts , lasting more then one second and softer in spectra , and the short bursts ( see fig .",
    "[ slb ] ) , harder in spectra ( see fig .",
    "[ tavani ] ) .",
    "we shall return shortly on this topic .",
    "s ) and long ( @xmath11 s ) grbs are represented . reproduced , by his kind permission , from tavani @xcite where the details are given . ]    . ]",
    "the situation drastically changed with the discovery of the afterglow by the italian - dutch satellite bepposax ( costa et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the possibility which led to the optical identification of the grbs by the largest telescopes in the world , including the hubble space telescope , the keck telescope in hawaii and the vlt in chile , and allowed as well the identification in the radio band of these sources .",
    "the outcome of this collaboration between complementary observational technique has led to the possibility of identifying in 1997 the distance of these sources from the earth and their tremendous energy of the order up to @xmath12 erg / second during the burst .",
    "it is interesting , as we will show in the following , that an energetics of this magnitude for the grbs had previously been predicted out of first principles already in 1974 by damour and ruffini @xcite .",
    "the resonance between the x- and gamma ray astronomy from the satellites and the optical and radio astronomy from the ground , had already marked in the seventies the great success and development of the astrophysics of binary x - ray sources ( see e.g. giacconi & ruffini @xcite ) .",
    "this resonance is re - proposed here for grbs on a much larger scale .",
    "the use of much larger satellites , like chandra and xmm - newton , and dedicated space missions , like hete-2 and , in the near future , swift , and the very fortunate circumstance of the coming of age of the development of unprecedented optical technologies for the telescopes offers opportunities without precedence in the history of mankind . in parallel ,",
    "the enormous scientific interest on the nature of grb sources and the exploration , not only of new regimes , but also of totally novel conceptual physical process of the blackholic energy , make the knowledge of grbs an authentic new frontier in the scientific knowledge .",
    "the study of grbs is very likely `` the '' most extensive computational and theoretical investigation ever done in physics and astrophysics .",
    "there are at least three different fields of research which underlie the foundation of the theoretical understanding of grbs .",
    "all three , for different reasons , are very difficult .    the first field of research is the field of special relativity . as i always mention to my students in the course of theoretical physics , this field is paradoxically very difficult since it is extremely simple . in approaching special relativistic phenomena",
    "the extremely simple and clear procedures expressed by einstein in his 1905 classic paper @xcite are often ignored .",
    "einstein makes use in his work of very few physical assumptions , an almost elementary mathematical framework and gives constant attention to a proper operational definition of all observable quantities .",
    "those who work on grbs use at times very intricate , complex and often wrong theoretical approaches lacking the necessary self - consistency .",
    "this is well demonstrated in the current literature on grbs .    the second field of research essential for understanding the energetics of grbs deals with quantum electrodynamics and the relativistic process of pair creation in overcritical electromagnetic fields .",
    "this topic is also very difficult but for a quite different conceptual reason : the process of pair creation , expressed in the classic works of heisenberg - euler - schwinger @xcite later developed by many others , is based on a very powerful theoretical framework but has never been verified by experimental data .",
    "the quest for creating electron - positron pairs by vacuum polarization processes in heavy ion collisions or in lasers has not yet been successfully achieved in earth - bound experiments ( see e.g. ruffini , vitagliano , xue @xcite ) . as we will show here , there is the tantalizing possibility of observing this phenomenon , for the first time , in the astrophysical setting of grbs on a more grandiose scale .    there is a third field which is essential for the understanding of the grb phenomenon : general relativity . in this case , contrary to the case of special relativity , the field is indeed very difficult , since it is very difficult both from a conceptual , technical and mathematical point of view .",
    "the physical assumptions are indeed complex .",
    "the entire concept of geometrization of physics needs a new conceptual approach to the field .",
    "the mathematical complexity of the pseudo - riemannian geometry contrasts now with the simple structure of the pseudo - euclidean minkowski space .",
    "the operational definition of the observable quantities has to take into account the intrinsic geometrical properties and also the cosmological settings of the source . with grbs we have the possibility to follow , from a safe position in an asymptotically flat space at large distance , the formation of the horizon of a black hole with all the associated relativistic phenomena of light bending and time dilatation .",
    "most important , as we will show in details in this presentation , general relativity in connection with quantum phenomena offers , with the blackholic energy , the explanation of the tremendous grb energy sources .    for these reasons grbs offer an authentic new frontier in the field of physics and astrophysics .",
    "it is appropriate to mention some of the goals of such a new frontier in the above three fields .",
    "we recall in the special relativity field , for the first time , we observe phenomena occurring at lorentz gamma factors of approximately @xmath13 . in the field of relativistic quantum electro - dynamics we see for the first time the interchange between classical fields and",
    "the created quantum matter - antimatter pairs . in the field of general relativity also for the first time we can test the blackholic energy which is the basic energetic physical variable underlying the entire grb phenomenon .",
    "the most appealing aspect of this work is that , if indeed these three different fields are treated and approached with the necessary technical and scientific maturity , the model which results has a very large redundancy built - in .",
    "the approach requires an unprecedented level of self - consistency .",
    "any departures from the correct theoretical treatment in this very complex system lead to exponential departures from the correct solution and from the correct fit of the observations .",
    "it is so that , as the model is being properly developed and verified , its solution will have existence and uniqueness .",
    "the ongoing dialogue between our work and the one of the workers on grbs , rests still on some elementary considerations presented by einstein in his classic article of 1905 @xcite .",
    "these considerations are quite general and even precede einstein s derivation , out of first principles , of the lorentz transformations .",
    "we recall here einstein s words : `` we might , of course , content ourselves with time values determined by an observer stationed together with the watch at the origin of the co - ordinates , and co - ordinating the corresponding positions of the hands with light signals , given out by every event to be timed , and reaching him through empty space . but",
    "this co - ordination has the disadvantage that it is not independent of the standpoint of the observer with the watch or clock , as we know from experience '' .     and the laboratory time @xmath14 .",
    "details in ruffini et al .",
    "]    the message by einstein is simply illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ttasch_new_bn ] .",
    "if we consider in an inertial frame a source ( solid line ) moving with high speed and emitting light signals ( dashed lines ) along the direction of its motion , a far away observer will measure a delay @xmath15 between the arrival time of two signals emitted at the origin and after a time interval @xmath16 in the laboratory frame .",
    "the real velocity of the source is given by : @xmath17 and the apparent velocity is given by : @xmath18 as pointed out by einstein the adoption of coordinating light signals simply by their arrival time as in eq.([vapp ] ) , without an adequate definition of synchronization , is incorrect and leads to unsurmountable difficulties as well as to apparently `` superluminal '' velocities as soon as motions close to the speed of light are considered .",
    "the use of @xmath15 as a time coordinate , often tacitly adopted by astronomers , should be done , if at all , with proper care .",
    "the relation between @xmath15 and the correct time parameterization in the laboratory frame has to be taken into account : @xmath19 in other words , the relation between the arrival time and the laboratory time can not be done without a knowledge of the speed along the entire world - line of the source . in the case of grbs ,",
    "such a worldline starts at the moment of gravitational collapse .",
    "it is of course clear that the parameterization in the laboratory frame has to take into account the cosmological redshift @xmath20 of the source .",
    "we then have , at the detector : @xmath21    in the current grb literature , eq.([tadef ] ) has been systematically neglected by addressing only the afterglow description neglecting the previous history of the source . often the integral equation has been approximated by a clearly incorrect instantaneous value : @xmath22 the attitude has been adopted that it should be possible to consider separately the afterglow part of the grb phenomenon , without the knowledge of the entire equation of motion of the source .",
    "this point of view has reached its most extreme expression in the works reviewed by piran @xcite , where the so - called `` prompt radiation '' , lasting on the order of @xmath4 s , is considered as a burst emitted by the prolonged activity of an `` inner engine '' . in these models ,",
    "generally referred to as the `` internal shock model '' , the emission of the afterglow is assumed to follow the `` prompt radiation '' phase @xcite .",
    "as we outline in the following , such an extreme point of view originates from the inability of obtaining the time scale of the `` prompt radiation '' from a burst structure .",
    "these authors consequently appeal to the existence of an `` ad hoc '' inner engine in the grb source to solve this problem .",
    "we show in the following how this difficulty has been overcome in our approach by interpreting the `` prompt radiation '' as an integral part of the afterglow and _ not _ as a burst .",
    "this explanation can be reached only through a relativistically correct theoretical description of the entire afterglow ( see section [ aft ] ) . within the framework of special relativity",
    "we show that it is not possible to describe a grb phenomenon by disregarding the knowledge of the entire past worldline of the source .",
    "we show that at @xmath4 seconds the emission occurs from a region of dimensions of approximately @xmath23 cm , well within the region of activity of the afterglow .",
    "this point was not appreciated in the current literature due to the neglect of the apparent superluminal effects implied by the use of the `` pathological '' parametrization of the grb phenomenon by the arrival time of light signals .",
    "an additional difference between our treatment and the ones in the current literature relates to the assumption of the existence of scaling laws in the afterglow phase : the power law dependence of the lorentz gamma factor on the radial coordinate is usually systematically assumed . from the proper use of the relativistic transformations and by the direct numerical and analytic integration of the special relativistic equations of motion we demonstrate ( see section [ eqaft ] ) that no simple power - law relation can be derived for the equations of motion of the system .",
    "this situation is not new for workers in relativistic theories : scaling laws exist in the extreme ultrarelativistic regimes and in the newtonian ones but not in the intermediate fully relativistic regimes ( see e.g. ruffini @xcite ) .",
    "three of the most important works in the field of general relativity have certainly been the discovery of the kerr solution @xcite , its generalization to the charged case ( newman et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the formulation by brandon carter @xcite of the hamilton - jacobi equations for a charged test particle in the metric and electromagnetic field of a kerr - newman solution ( see e.g. landau and lifshitz @xcite ) .",
    "the equations of motion , which are generally second order differential equations , were reduced by carter to a set of first order differential equations which were then integrated by using an effective potential technique by ruffini and wheeler for the kerr metric ( see e.g. landau and lifshitz @xcite ) and by ruffini for the reissner - nordstrm geometry ( ruffini @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ effp ] ) .",
    "all the above mathematical results were essential for understanding the new physics of gravitationally collapsed objects and allowed the publication of a very popular article : `` introducing the black hole '' ( ruffini and wheeler @xcite ) . in that paper",
    ", we advanced the ansatz that the most general black hole is a solution of the einstein - maxwell equations , asymptotically flat and with a regular horizon : the kerr - newman solution , characterized only by three parameters : the mass @xmath24 , the charge @xmath25 and the angular momentum @xmath26 .",
    "this ansatz of the `` black hole uniqueness theorem '' still today after thirty years presents challenges to the mathematical aspects of its complete proof ( see e.g. carter @xcite and bini et al .",
    "in addition to these mathematical difficulties , in the field of physics this ansatz contains the most profound consequences .",
    "the fact that , among all the possible highly nonlinear terms characterizing the gravitationally collapsed objects , only the ones corresponding solely to the einstein maxwell equations survive the formation of the horizon has , indeed , extremely profound physical implications .",
    "any departure from such a minimal configuration either collapses on the horizon or is radiated away during the collapse process .",
    "this ansatz is crucial in identifying precisely the process of gravitational collapse leading to the formation of the black hole and the emission of grbs .",
    "indeed , in this specific case , the born - like nonlinear @xcite term of the heisenberg - euler - schwinger @xcite lagrangian are radiated away prior to the formation of the horizon of the black hole ( see e.g. ruffini et al .",
    "@xcite ) . only the nonlinearity corresponding solely to the classical einstein - maxwell theory is left as the outcome of the gravitational collapse process .    the same effective potential technique ( see landau and lifshitz @xcite ) , which allowed the analysis of circular orbits around the black hole , was crucial in reaching the equally interesting discovery of the reversible and irreversible transformations of black holes by christodoulou and ruffini @xcite , which in turn led to the mass - energy formula of the black hole : @xmath27 with @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the horizon surface area",
    ", @xmath30 is the irreducible mass , @xmath31 is the horizon radius and @xmath32 is the quasi - spheroidal cylindrical coordinate of the horizon evaluated at the equatorial plane .",
    "extreme black holes satisfy the equality in eq.([s1 ] ) .    from eq.([em ] ) follows that the total energy of the black hole @xmath33 can be split into three different parts : rest mass , coulomb energy and rotational energy . in principle both coulomb energy and rotational energy can be extracted from the black hole ( christodoulou and ruffini @xcite ) .",
    "the maximum extractable rotational energy is 29% and the maximum extractable coulomb energy is 50% of the total energy , as clearly follows from the upper limit for the existence of a black hole , given by eq.([s1 ] ) .",
    "we refer in the following to both these extractable energies as the blackholic energy .",
    "the existence of the black hole and the basic correctness of the circular orbits has been proven by the observations of cygnus - x1 ( see e.g. giacconi and ruffini @xcite ) . however ,",
    "in binary x - ray sources , the black hole uniquely acts passively by generating the deep potential well in which the accretion process occurs .",
    "it has become tantalizing to look for astrophysical objects in order to verify the other fundamental prediction of general relativity that the blackholic energy is the largest energy extractable from any physical object .",
    "as we shall see in the next section , the feasibility of the extraction of the blackholic energy has been made possible by the quantum processes of creating , out of classical fields , a plasma of electron - positron pairs in the field of black holes .",
    "the manifestation of such process of energy extraction from the black hole is astrophysically manifested by the occurrence of grbs .      that a static electromagnetic field stronger than a critical value : @xmath34 can polarize the vacuum and create electron - positron pairs was clearly evidenced by heisenberg and euler @xcite .",
    "the major effort in verifying the correctness of this theoretical prediction has been directed in the analysis of heavy ion collisions ( see ruffini et al . @xcite and references therein ) . from an order - of - magnitude estimate , it appears that around a nucleus with a charge : @xmath35 the electric field can be stronger than the electric field polarizing the vacuum .",
    "a more accurate detailed analysis taking into account the bound states levels around a nucleus brings to a value of @xmath36 for the nuclear charge leading to the existence of a critical field . from the heisenberg uncertainty principle it follows that",
    ", in order to create a pair , the existence of the critical field should last a time @xmath37 which is much longer then the typical confinement time in heavy ion collisions which is @xmath38 this is certainly a reason why no evidence for pair creation in heavy ion collisions has been obtained although remarkable effort has been spent in various accelerators worldwide .",
    "similar experiments involving laser beams encounter analogous difficulties ( see e.g. ruffini et al .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the alternative idea was advanced in 1975 @xcite that the critical field condition given in eq.([ec ] ) could be reached easily , and for a time much larger than the one given by eq.([dt ] ) , in the field of a kerr - newman black hole in a range of masses @xmath39 . in that paper",
    "we have generalized to the curved kerr - newman geometry the fundamental theoretical framework developed in minkowski space by heisenberg - euler @xcite and schwinger @xcite .",
    "this result was made possible by the work on the structure of the kerr - newman spacetime previously done by carter @xcite and by the remarkable mathematical craftsmanship of thibault damour then working with me as a post - doc in princeton .",
    "the maximum energy extractable in such a process of creating a vast amount of electron - positron pairs around a black hole is given by : @xmath40 we concluded in that paper that such a process `` naturally leads to a most simple model for the explanation of the recently discovered @xmath41-rays bursts '' .",
    "at that time , grbs had not yet been optically identified and nothing was known about their distance and consequently about their energetics .",
    "literally thousands of theories existed in order to explain them and it was impossible to establish a rational dialogue with such an enormous number of alternative theories .",
    "we did not pursue further our model until the results of the bepposax mission , which clearly pointed to the cosmological origin of grbs , implying for the typical magnitude of their energy precisely the one predicted by our model .",
    "it is interesting that the idea of using an electron - positron plasma as a basis of a grb model was independently introduced years later in a set of papers by cavallo and rees @xcite , cavallo and horstman @xcite and horstman and cavallo @xcite .",
    "these authors did not address the issue of the physical origin of their energy source .",
    "they reach their conclusions considering the pair creation and annihilation process occurring in the confinement of a large amount of energy in a region of dimension @xmath42 km typical of a neutron star .",
    "no relation to the physics of black holes nor to the energy extraction process from a black hole was envisaged in their interesting considerations , mainly directed to the study of the opacity and the consequent dynamics of such an electron - positron plasma .",
    "after the discovery of the afterglows and the optical identification of grbs at cosmological distances , implying exactly the energetics predicted in eq.([emax ] ) , we returned to the analysis of the vacuum polarization process around a black hole and precisely identified the region around the black hole in which the vacuum polarization process and the consequent creation of electron - positron pairs occur .",
    "we defined this region , using the greek name dyad for pairs ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) , to be the `` dyadosphere '' of the black hole , bounded by the black hole horizon and the dyadosphere radius @xmath45 given by ( see ruffini @xcite , preparata et al . @xcite and fig.[dya ] ) : @xmath46 where we have introduced the dimensionless mass and charge parameters @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "the analysis of the dyadosphere was developed , at that time , around an already formed black hole . in recent months",
    "we have been developing the dynamical formation of the black hole and correspondingly of the dyadosphere during the process of gravitational collapse , reaching some specific signatures which may be detectable in the structure of the short and long grbs ( cherubini et al .",
    "@xcite , ruffini and vitagliano @xcite , ruffini et al .",
    "many details of this topic have been presented in great details in ruffini et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "after the vacuum polarization process around a black hole , one of the topics of the greatest scientific interest is the analysis of the dynamics of the electron - positron plasma formed in the dyadosphere .",
    "this issue was addressed by us in a very effective collaboration with jim wilson at livermore .",
    "the numerical simulations of this problem were developed at livermore , while the semi - analytic approach was developed in rome ( ruffini et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    the corresponding treatment in the framework of the cavallo et al . analysis was performed by piran et al . @xcite also using a numerical approach , by bisnovaty - kogan and murzina @xcite using an analytic approach and by mszros , laguna and rees @xcite using a numerical and semi - analytic approach .    although some analogies exists between these treatments , they are significantly different in the theoretical details and in the final results . since the final result of the grb model is extremely sensitive to any departure from the correct treatment , it is indeed very important to detect at every step the appearance of possible fatal errors .",
    "a conclusion common to all these treatments is that the electron - positron plasma is initially optically thick and expands till transparency reaching very high values of the lorentz gamma factor .",
    "a second point , which is common , is the discovery of a new clear feature : the plasma shell expands but the lorentz contraction is such that its width in the laboratory frame appears to be constant .",
    "there is however a major difference between our approach and the ones of piran , mszros and rees , in that the dyadosphere is assumed by us to be filled uniquely with an electron - positron plasma .",
    "such a plasma expands in substantial agreement with the results presented in the work of bisnovati - kogan and murzina @xcite . in our model",
    "the pulse of electron - positron pairs and photons ( pem pulse , see ruffini et al .",
    "@xcite ) evolves and at a radius on the order of @xmath49 cm it encounters the remnant of the star progenitor of the newly formed black hole .",
    "the pem pulse is then loaded with baryons .",
    "a new pulse is formed of electron - positron - photons and baryons ( pemb pulse , see ruffini et al .",
    "@xcite ) which expands all the way until transparency is reached . at transparency",
    "the emitted photons give origin to what we define as the proper - grb ( see ruffini et al . @xcite and fig .",
    "[ cip2 ] ) .    ) .",
    "details in ruffini et al .",
    "]    in our approach , the baryon loading is measured by a dimensionless quantity @xmath50 which gives direct information about the mass @xmath51 of the remnant . the corresponding treatment done by piran and collaborators ( shemi & piran @xcite , piran et al .",
    "@xcite ) and by mszros , laguna and rees @xcite differs in one important respect : the baryonic loading is assumed to occur since the beginning of the electron - positron pair formation and no relation to the mass of the remnant of the collapsed progenitor star is attributed to it .",
    "a marked difference also exists between our description of the rate equation for the electron - positron pairs and the ones by those authors . while our results are comparable with the ones obtained by piran under the same initial conditions , the set of approximations adopted by mszros , laguna and rees @xcite appears to be too radical and leads to very different results violating energy and momentum conservation ( see bianco et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    from our analysis ( ruffini et al .",
    "@xcite ) it also becomes clear that such expanding dynamical evolution can only occur for values of @xmath52 .",
    "this prediction , as we will show shortly in the three grb sources considered here , is very satisfactorily confirmed by observations .    from the value of the @xmath53 parameter , related to the mass of the remnant",
    ", it therefore follows that the collapse to a black hole leading to a grb is drastically different from the collapse to a neutron star . while in the case of a neutron star collapse",
    "a very large amount of matter is expelled , in many instances well above the mass of the neutron star itself , in the case of black holes leading to a grb only a very small fraction of the initial mass ( @xmath54 or less ) is expelled .",

    "@xcite ) emphasizes the importance of a global analysis of the grb phenomenon encompassing both the optically thick and the afterglow phases . since all the data are received in the detector arrival time it is essential to know the equations of motion of all relativistic phases with @xmath187 of the grb sources in order to reconstruct the time coordinate in the laboratory frame , see eq.([tadef ] ) .",
    "contrary to other phenomena in nonrelativistic physics or astrophysics , where every phase can be examined separately from the others , in the case of grbs all the phases are inter - related by their signals received in arrival time @xmath61 .",
    "there is the need , in order to describe the physics of the source , to derive the laboratory time @xmath14 as a function of the arrival time @xmath61 along the entire past worldline of the source using eq.([taddef ] ) .    the second paradigm , the interpretation of the burst structure ( ibs ) paradigm ( ruffini et al .",
    "@xcite ) covers three fundamental issues : + a ) the existence , in the general grb , of two different components : the p - grb and the afterglow related by precise equations determining their relative amplitude and temporal sequence ( see ruffini et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; + b ) what in the literature has been addressed as the `` prompt emission '' and considered as a burst , in our model is not a burst at all  instead it is just the emission from the peak of the afterglow ( see fig .",
    "[ grb991216 ] ) ; + c ) the crucial role of the parameter @xmath53 in determining the relative amplitude of the p - grb to the afterglow and discriminating between the short and the long bursts ( see fig . [ bcross ] ) .",
    "both short and long bursts arise from the same physical phenomena : the dyadosphere .",
    "the absence of baryonic matter in the remnant leads to the short bursts and no afterglow .",
    "the presence of baryonic matter with @xmath52 leads to the afterglow and consequently to its peak emission which gives origin to the so - called long bursts .    ) , are plotted as functions of the @xmath53 parameter . ]",
    "the third paradigm , the grb - supernova time sequence ( gsts ) paradigm ( ruffini et al .",
    "@xcite ) , deals with the relation of the grb and the associated supernova process , and acquires a special meaning in relation to the sources grb 980425 and grb 030329 as we will show in the following .",
    "we now shortly illustrate some consequences of these three paradigms .",
    "the order of magnitude estimate usually quoted for the the characteristic time scale to be expected for a burst emitted by a grb at the moment of transparency at the end of the expansion of the optically thick phase is given by @xmath188 , which for a @xmath189 black hole will give @xmath190 s. there are reasons today not to take seriously such an order of magnitude estimate ( see e.g. ruffini et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in any case",
    "this time is much shorter then the ones typically observed in `` prompt radiation '' of the long bursts , from a few seconds all the way to @xmath4 s. in the current literature ( see e.g. piran @xcite and references therein ) , in order to explain the `` prompt radiation '' and overcome the above difficulty it has been generally assumed that its origin should be related to a prolonged `` inner engine '' activity preceding the afterglow which is not well identified .",
    "to us this explanation has always appeared logically inconsistent since there remain to be explained not one but two very different mechanisms , independent of each other , of similar and extremely large energetics .",
    "this approach has generated an additional very negative result : it has distracted everybody working in the field from the earlier very interesting work on the optically thick phase of grbs .",
    "the way out of this dichotomy in our model is drastically different : 1 ) indeed the optically thick phase exists , is crucial to the grb phenomenon and terminates with a burst : the p - grb ; 2 ) the `` prompt radiation '' follows the p - grb ; 3 ) the `` prompt radiation '' is not a burst : it is actually the temporally extended peak emission of the afterglow ( e - ape ) .",
    "the observed structures of the prompt radiation can all be traced back to inhomogeneities in the interstellar medium ( see fig .",
    "[ grb991216 ] and ruffini et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the fundamental diagram determining the relative intensity of the p - grb and the afterglow as a function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath53 has been shown in fig .",
    "[ bcross ] .",
    "the underlying machine generating the short and the long grbs is identical : in both cases is the dyadosphere .",
    "the main difference relates to the amount of baryonic matter engulfed by the electron - positron plasma in their optically thick phase prior to transparency . in the limit of small",
    "@xmath191 the intensity of the p - grb is larger and dominates the afterglow .",
    "this corresponds to the short bursts . for @xmath192",
    "the afterglow dominates the grbs and we have the so - called `` long bursts '' . for @xmath193 we may observe a third class of `` bursts '' , eventually related to a turbulent process occurring prior to transparency ( ruffini et al .",
    "this third family should be characterized by smaller values of the lorentz gamma factors than in the case of the short or long bursts .",
    "the relation between the grbs and the supernovae is one of the most complex aspects to be addressed by our model , which needs the understanding of new fields of general relativistic physics in relation to yet unexplored many - body solutions in a substantially new astrophysical scenario .    as we will show in the two systems grb980425/sn1998bw and grb030329/sn2003dh which we are going to discuss next , there is in each one the possibility of an astrophysical `` triptych '' ] formed by : + 1 ) the formation of the black hole and the emission of the grb , + 2 ) the gravitational collapse of an evolved companion star , leading to a supernova , + 3 ) a clearly identified urca source whose nature appears to be of the greatest interest .",
    "this new astrophysical scenario presents new challenges : + a ) the identification of the physical reasons of the instability leading to the gravitational collapse of a @xmath194 star , giving origin to the black hole .",
    "such an implosion must occur radially with negligible mass of the remnant ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "+ b ) the identification of the physical reasons for the instability leading to the gravitational collapse of an evolved companion star , giving origin to the supernova .",
    "+ c ) the theoretical issues related to the urca sources , which range today in many possible directions : from the physics of black holes , to the physical processes occurring in the expanding supernova remnants , and finally to the very exciting possibility that we are observing for the first time a newly born neutron star .",
    "the main effort in the next sections is to show that the detailed understanding we have reached for the grb phenomenon and its afterglow allows us to state , convincingly , that the urca source , contrary to what established in the current literature , is not part of the grb nor of its afterglow .",
    "we will draw in the conclusions some considerations on the possible nature of the urca sources .",
    "we illustrate the application of our grb model to two different systems , which are quite different in the energetics but are both related to supernovae : grb 980425 and grb 030329",
    ". we will let the gradual theoretical understanding of the system to unveil the underlying astrophysical scenario .",
    "approaches in the current literature have always attempted to explain both the supernova and the grb as two aspects of a single phenomenon assuming that the grb takes his origin from a specially strong and yet unobserved supernova process : a hypernova ( see paczyski @xcite , kulkarni @xcite , iwamoto @xcite ) .    we have taken a very different approach , following cicero s classic aphorism `` divide et impera '' , which was adopted as the motto of the roman empire : `` divide and conquer '' . in this specific case of grbs , which are indeed a very complex system",
    ", we plan to divide and identify the truly independent physical constituents and conquer the understanding of the underlying astrophysical process .",
    "as we will see , this approach will lead to an unexpected and much richer scenario .",

    "we turn now to the most exciting search for the nature of urca-1 and urca-2 .",

    "namely , an emission from processes occurring in the early phases of the expansion of the supernova remnant or the very exciting possibility that for the first time we are observing a newly born neutron star out of the supernova phenomenon .",

    "we shall focus in the following only on this last topic .",
    "we have already recalled how the need for a rapid cooling process due to neutrino anti - neutrino emission in the process of gravitational collapse leading to the formation of a neutron star was considered for the first time by george gamow and mario schoenberg in 1941 @xcite .",
    "it was gamow who gave this process the name `` urca process '' , see [ gamow ] and [ urca ] .",
    "since then , a systematic analysis of the theory of neutron star cooling was advanced by tsuruta @xcite , tsuruta and cameron @xcite , tsuruta et al .",
    "@xcite and by canuto @xcite .",
    "the coming of age of x - ray observatories such as einstein ( 1978 - 1981 ) , exosat ( 1983 - 1986 ) , rosat ( 1990 - 1998 ) , and the contemporary missions of chandra and xmm - newton since 1999 dramatically presented an observational situation establishing very embarrassing and stringent upper limits to the surface temperature of neutron stars in well known historical supernova remnants ( see e.g. romani @xcite ) .",
    "it was so that , for some remnants , notably sn 1006 and the tycho supernova , the upper limits to the surface temperatures were significantly lower than the temperatures given by standard cooling times ( see e.g. romani @xcite ) .",
    "much of the theoretical works has been mainly directed , therefore , to find theoretical arguments in order to explain such low surface temperature @xmath623@xmath624 k  embarrassingly low , when compared to the initial hot ( @xmath625 k ) birth of a neutron star in a supernova explosion ( see e.g. romani @xcite ) . some very important steps in this direction of research",

    "the youngest neutron star to be searched for using its thermal emission in this context has been the pulsar psr j0205 + 6449 in 3c 58 ( see e.g. yakovlev and pethick @xcite ) , which is @xmath626 years old ! recently , evidence for the detection of thermal emission from the crab nebula pulsar was reported by trumper @xcite which is , again , @xmath627 years old .    in the case of urca-1 and urca-2",
    ", we are exploring a totally different regime : the x - ray emission possibly from a recently born neutron star in the first days  months of its existence , where no observations have yet been performed and no embarrassing constraints upper limits on the surface temperature exist .",
    "the reason of approaching first the issue of the thermal emission from the neutron star surface is extremely important , since in principle it can give information on the equations of state in the core at supranuclear densities and on the detailed mechanism of the formation of the neutron star itself and the related neutrino emission .",
    "it is of course possible that the neutron star is initially fast rotating and its early emission is dominated by the magnetospheric emission or by accretion processes from the remnant which would overshadow the thermal emission . in that case a periodic signal related to the neutron star rotational period should in principle be observable in a close enough grb source provided the suitable instrumentation from the earth .",
    "the literature on young born neutron star is relatively scarse today .",
    "there are some very interesting contributions which state : `` the time for a neutron star s center to cool by the direct urca process to a temperature @xmath297 has been estimated to be @xmath628^{-4}$ ] s. the direct urca process and all the exotic cooling mechanisms only occur at supranuclear densities .",
    "matter at subnuclear densities in neutron star crust cools primarily by diffusion of heat to the interior .",
    "thus the surface temperature remains high , in the vicinity of @xmath629 k or more , until the crust s heat reservoir is consumed . after this diffusion time , which is on the order of @xmath105@xmath630 years",
    ", the surface temperature abruptly plunges to values below @xmath631 k '' ( lattimer et al .",
    "`` soon after a supernova explosion , the young neutron star has large temperature gradients in the inner part of the crust .",
    "while the powerful neutrino emission quickly cools the core , the crust stays hot .",
    "the heat gradually flows inward on a conduction time scale and the whole process can be thought of as a cooling wave propagation from the center toward the surface '' ( gnedin et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the two considerations we have quoted above are developed in the case of spherical symmetry and we would like to keep the mind open , in this new astrophysical field , to additional factors , some more traditional than others , to be taken into account . among the traditional ones we recall : 1 ) the presence of rotation and magnetic field which may affect the thermal conductivity and the structure of the surface , as well as the above mentioned magnetospheric emission ; 2 ) there could be accretion of matter from the expanding nebula ; and , among the nontraditional ones , we recall 3 ) some exciting theoretical possibilities advanced by dyson on volcanoes on neutron stars @xcite as well as iron helide on neutron star @xcite , as well as the possibility of piconuclear reactions on neutron star surface discussed in lai & salpeter @xcite .",
    "all the above are just scientific arguments to attract attention on the abrupt fall in luminosity reported in this meeting on urca-1 by elena pian which is therefore , in this light , of the greatest scientific interest and further analysis should be followed to check if a similar behavior will be found in future xmm and chandra observations also in urca-2 .",
    "in addition to these very rich problematics in the field of theoretical physics and theoretical astrophysics , there are also more classical astronomical and astrophysical issues , which will need to be answered if indeed the observations of a young neutron star will be confirmed .",
    "an important issue to be addressed will be how the young neutron star can be observed , escaping from being buried under the expelled matter of the collapsing star .",
    "a possible explanation can originate from the binary nature of the newly born neutron star : the binary system being formed by the newly formed black hole and the triggered gravitational collapse of a companion evolved star leading , possibly , to a `` kick '' on and ejection of the newly born neutron star .",
    "another possibility , also related to the binary nature of the system , is that the supernova progenitor star has been depleted of its outer layer by dynamic tidal effects .",
    "in addition , there are other topics in which our scenario can open new research directions in fundamental physics and astrophysics : + 1 ) the problem of the instability leading to the complete gravitational collapse of a @xmath194 star needs the introduction of a new critical mass for gravitational collapse , which is quite different from the one for white dwarfs and neutron stars which has been widely discussed in the current literature ( see e.g. giacconi & ruffini @xcite ) .",
    "+ 2 ) the issue of the trigger of the instability of gravitational collapse induced by the grb on the progenitor star of the supernova or , vice versa , by the supernova on the progenitor star of the grb needs accurate timing and the considerations of new relativistic phenomena .",
    "+ 3 ) the general relativistic instability induced on a nearby star by the formation of a black hole needs some very basic new developments in the field of general relativity .",
    "only a very preliminary work exists on this subject , by jim wilson and his collaborators , see e.g. the paper by mathews and wilson @xcite .",
    "the reason for the complexity in answering such a question is simply stated : unlike the majority of theoretical work on black holes , which deals mainly with one - body solutions , we have to address here a many - body problem in general relativity .",
    "we are starting in these days to reconsider , in this framework , some classic work by fermi @xcite , hanni and ruffini @xcite , majumdar @xcite , papapetrou @xcite , parker et al .",

    "has also been accomplished on establishing an absolute lower limit to the irreducible mass of the black hole as well as on some critical considerations about the relations of general relativity and the second law of thermodynamics .",

    "we then analyze , using recent progress in the solution of the vlasov - boltzmann - maxwell system , the oscillation regime in the created electron - positron plasma and their rapid convergence to a thermalized spectrum .",
    "we conclude by making precise predictions for the spectra , the energy fluxes and characteristic time - scales of the radiation for short - bursts .",

    "it is now clear that if our theoretical predictions will be confirmed , we will have a very powerful tool for cosmological observations : the independent information about luminosity , time - scale and spectrum can uniquely determine the mass , the electromagnetic structure and the distance from the observer of the collapsing core , see e.g. fig .",

    "we called it the urca process , partially to commemorate the casino in which we first met , and partially because the urca process results in a rapid disappearance of thermal energy from the interior of the star , similar to the rapid disappearance of money from the pockets of the gamblers of the casino d urca . sending our article `` on the urca process '' for publication on the _ physical review _",
    "i was worried that the editor would ask why we called the process `` urca '' .",

    "<S> we here address the issue of the long grbs . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical understanding of the long grbs has led to the detailed description of their luminosities in fixed energy bands , of their spectral features and made also possible to probe the astrophysical scenario in which they originate . </S>",
    "<S> we are specially interested , in this report , to a subclass of long grbs which appear to be accompanied by a supernova explosion . </S>",
    "<S> we are considering two specific examples : grb980425/sn1998bw and grb030329/sn2003dh . </S>",
    "<S> while these supernovae appear to have a standard energetics of @xmath1 ergs , the grbs are highly variable and can have energetics @xmath2  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 times larger than the ones of the supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , many long grbs occurs without the presence of a supernova . </S>",
    "<S> it is concluded that in no way a grb can originate from a supernova . </S>",
    "<S> the precise theoretical understanding of the grb luminosity we present evidence , in both these systems , the existence of an independent component in the x - ray emission , usually interpreted in the current literature as part of the grb afterglow . </S>",
    "<S> this component has been observed by chandra and xmm to have a strong decay on scale of months . </S>",
    "<S> we have named here these two sources respectively urca-1 and urca-2 , in honor of the work that george gamow and mario shoenberg did in 1939 in this town of urca identifying the basic mechanism , the urca processes , leading to the process of gravitational collapse and the formation of a neutron star and a supernova . </S>",
    "<S> the further hypothesis is considered to relate this x - ray source to a neutron star , newly born in the supernova . </S>",
    "<S> this hypothesis should be submitted to further theoretical and observational investigation . </S>",
    "<S> some theoretical developments to clarify the astrophysical origin of this new scenario are outlined . </S>",
    "<S> we turn then to the theoretical developments in the short grbs : we first report some progress in the understanding the dynamical phase of collapse , the mass - energy formula and the extraction of blackholic energy which have been motivated by the analysis of the short grbs . in this context progress </S>",
    "<S> has also been accomplished on establishing an absolute lower limit to the irreducible mass of the black hole as well as on some critical considerations about the relations of general relativity and the second law of thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we recall how this last issue has been one of the most debated in theoretical physics in the past thirty years due to the work of bekenstein and hawking . following these conceptual progresses </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the vacuum polarization process around an overcritical collapsing shell . </S>",
    "<S> we evidence the existence of a separatrix and a dyadosphere trapping surface in the dynamics of the electron - positron plasma generated during the process of gravitational collapse . </S>",
    "<S> we then analyze , using recent progress in the solution of the vlasov - boltzmann - maxwell system , the oscillation regime in the created electron - positron plasma and their rapid convergence to a thermalized spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by making precise predictions for the spectra , the energy fluxes and characteristic time - scales of the radiation for short - bursts . if the precise luminosity variation and spectral hardening of the radiation we have predicted will be confirmed by observations of short - bursts , these systems will play a major role as standard candles in cosmology . </S>",
