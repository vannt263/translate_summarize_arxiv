    "the discovery of the higgs boson at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) in 2012 followed by a series of null results from beyond standard model ( bsm ) searches have repeatedly confirmed validity of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics at energies accessible to the lhc . in spite of being the most successful theory of particle physics till date",
    ", the sm however fails to explain many observed phenomena which include non - zero neutrino masses and mixing , dark matter and matter - antimatter asymmetry , in particular .",
    "though the higgs field in the sm is responsible for generating masses of all the charged fermions and weak vector bosons , it has no renormalisable coupling with the neutrinos due to the absence of the right handed neutrino .",
    "this keeps the neutrinos massless in the sm and hence no leptonic mixing which is ruled out by the experimental observations of non - zero neutrino masses and large leptonic mixing @xcite .",
    "the present status of neutrino parameters can be summarised by the recent global fit analysis reported in @xcite and @xcite are shown in table [ tab : data1 ] .",
    ".global fit @xmath1 values of neutrino oscillation parameters @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     c    c",
    "we have studied a minimal extension of the standard model in order to generate tiny dirac neutrino masses at one loop level such that the particles going inside a loop can also generate the correct dark matter abundance and matter antimatter asymmetry in the universe .",
    "considering the heavy dirac fermion decay as the source of lepton asymmetry , we write down the relevant boltzmann equations and solve them numerically . considering the lightest heavy fermion to have mass 5 tev , the next to lightest one to be 12 tev and equal yukawa couplings @xmath2 , we calculate the final baryon asymmetry for different values of yukawa couplings .",
    "the baryon asymmetry as a function of @xmath3 is shown in figure [ figlepto ] for two different values of yukawa couplings @xmath4 .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that for both the values of yukawa couplings , the final asymmetry @xmath5 lies in the range observed by the planck experiment .",
    "we also find the constraint on yukawa coupling from the requirement that the heavy fermion decay process freezes out before the electroweak sphaleron temperature @xmath6 gev and the lepton asymmetry gets converted into the correct baryon asymmetry observed .",
    "for the chosen masses of heavy fermions , this comes out to be @xmath7 .",
    "such yukawa couplings can naturally satisfy the constraints from the requirement of light neutrino masses .",
    "although the decay of @xmath8 can also produce an abundance of dark matter ( assumed to be the neutral component of @xmath9 here ) .",
    "however , since such scalar dark matter has large enough annihilation cross section to freeze out at a temperature much below the scale of leptogenesis @xmath10 , the final dark matter relic abundance is not sensitive to such productions from the decay of @xmath11 .",
    "we therefore calculate the dark matter relic abundance following the usual freeze out procedure outlined above .",
    "the different annihilation channels of the lighter neutral component of the doublet @xmath9 are shown as a function of its mass in the left panel of figure [ figdm1 ] . the typical annihilation cross section required to produce the correct relic abundance from the simplified formula",
    "is shown as the horizontal line .",
    "this shows two different mass ranges : one below @xmath12 , near the resonance @xmath13 and another in the heavy mass regime , in agreement with earlier works on inert doublet dark matter mentioned earlier .",
    "it is worth noting that for the maximum value of yukawa coupling @xmath4 consistent with successful leptogenesis for the chosen value of @xmath14 mass , the additional annihilation channel into neutrinos mediated by @xmath11 remains very much suppressed . in the right panel of [ figdm1 ] , we show the relic abundance by summing over all possible annihilation channels and for three different values of dm - higgs couplings .",
    "we then chose the low mass regime , allowed from relic abundance criteria and show the allowed parameter space in @xmath15 plane in figure [ figdm2 ] .",
    "it can be seen that , the latest lux bound on direct detection cross section and lhc bound on invisible higgs decay significantly constrain the parameter space , leaving out only a tiny region near the resonance @xmath13 .",
    "it should be noted that the lux 2016 bound appears as a band in the figure [ figdm2 ] after taking into the uncertainty in the higgs nucleon couplings mentioned above .",
    "finally , we calculate the contribution to charged lepton flavour violating decay @xmath16 from the charged component of the scalar doublet @xmath9 . taking the dark matter mass to be 62 gev , allowed from all existing bounds ( as seen from figure [ figdm2 ] ) , we first calculate the bound on charged scalar mass from ewpd .",
    "this together with lep bound only leaves a small allowed region shown in figure [ figlfv ] .",
    "we also show the exclusion line from meg 2016 bound on @xmath17 .",
    "we then show the branching ratio as a function of charged scalar mass for two different choices of yukawa coupling @xmath4 and the chosen value of @xmath14 mass , @xmath18 tev .",
    "it can be seen from figure [ figlfv ] that for the maximum allowed value of yukawa ( from successful leptogenesis ) , the contribution to the lfv decay remains suppressed by more than three order of magnitudes compared to the latest meg bound . however , for higher values of yukawa , the corresponding branching ratio lies very close to the meg bound and should be observed in near future .    to summarise ,",
    "we have studied a model which can simultaneously address the the problem of tiny neutrino mass , dark matter and baryon asymmetry with the new physics sector lying close to the tev scale .",
    "apart from being in agreement with all observed data , the model also offers the possibility of being verified or falsified at ongoing and near future experiments .",
    "while the lux 2016 data allow a very tiny window of dark matter mass in the low mass regime , the ewpd constraints fixes the charged scalar mass to a small range at the same time .",
    "although direct detection experiments may take a long time to rule out the resonance region completely , the lfv decay provides an alternate probe of that mass range .",
    "near future observation of @xmath16 will however rule out the scenario of leptogenesis in this minimal setup as it will imply higher values of yukawa couplings than allowed from successful leptogenesis .",
    "such high values of yukawa couplings will also lead to some unnatural fine tuning in the neutrino mass formula .",
    "another falsifiable way is the observation of @xmath19 as it will rule out the pure dirac nature of light neutrinos considered in this particular model .",
