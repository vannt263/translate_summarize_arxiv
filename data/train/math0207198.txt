    "in this paper we provide the solution to an optimization problem which has various interpretations .",
    "although we will put special emphasis on the one mentioned in the title , the underlying mathematical problem does not require any knowledge from continuum mechanics and/or finite plasticity .",
    "therefore we start with a naive formulation as an optimal factorization problem in the group @xmath1 of invertible @xmath2  by  @xmath2-matrices with determinant  @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 denote the set of @xmath2  by  @xmath2-matrices with zero trace , and let @xmath5 so @xmath6 and @xmath7 are generators for shearings along the coordinate axes in  @xmath8 .",
    "then it is well - known that every @xmath9 may be written as a product @xmath10 we want to find factorization(s ) of a given  @xmath11 such that @xmath12 is minimal .",
    "therefore we define the _ factorization cost _ @xmath13 as @xmath14{l }        k\\in{{\\mathbb n}},\\ t_k\\in{{\\mathbb r}},\\\\   a_k\\in\\{p , q\\ }      \\end{array }    } \\right\\ } } .\\ ] ] the factorization cost @xmath13 can be interpreted as the distance of  @xmath11 from the identity matrix .",
    "it can also be used to measure distances in the group @xmath15 : @xmath16 it turns out that @xmath17 , @xmath18 are metrics on  @xmath15 , by construction @xmath17 is left - invariant while @xmath18 is right - invariant : @xmath19 in the sequel we will solve the problem of computing @xmath13 through an associated optimal control problem .",
    "our technique is kind of standard in control theory in the sense that we use the pontrjagin maximum principle ( pmp ) as a necessary condition for optimality plus some adhoc comparison arguments .",
    "we will also point out how the ( pmp ) relates to the * yield surface * and * flow rule * used in the plasticity literature .      in order to give the reader an idea of the final outcome ( and the computational complexity ) we state a few consequences of our final results .",
    "[ six - factors - preview - thm ] every @xmath20 has an optimal factorization of the form @xmath21    so no more than @xmath22 factors are needed , but it is necessary to allow factors of the form  @xmath23 , too .",
    "otherwise @xmath13 will be an infimum for some matrices @xmath20 , in particular for @xmath24 with @xmath25 .    as a consequence , finding an optimal factorization is reduced to a finite problem .",
    "we will actually obtain the following , much more detailed information :    [ family-64-thm ] there exists a sufficient family consisting of  @xmath26 maps , i.e. , there exist functions @xmath27 with the following property : for every @xmath20 there exist @xmath28 and @xmath29 such that @xmath30 provides an optimal factorization of  @xmath11 .    if one is really interested in computing an optimal factorization explicitly one can exploit the symmetry of the problem and reduce the number of maps that have to be inverted to  @xmath31 ( rather than @xmath26).[64 - 13-notice ] for efficient computation of the function @xmath32 one can even reduce this to  @xmath33 maps .    to give a rough idea of the computational complexity we note that except for one map , nothing worse than solving quadratic equations is required . in this _ worst case _ the challenge consists of solving a cubic equation @xmath34 , and this needs to be done only over an @xmath35-interval where the underlying cubic polynomial @xmath36 is strictly increasing , convex , and , @xmath37 is bounded away from  @xmath38 .    finally , we will show that for any other pair of rank-@xmath3 matrices @xmath39 the solution of the associated factorization problem for @xmath40 can be obtained from @xmath13 in the following , very simple way :    [ other-2slip - thm ] let @xmath39 with @xmath41 , @xmath42\\neq0 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath43 denote the factorization cost for @xmath44 .",
    "then there exist @xmath45 and an automorphism @xmath46 such that @xmath47 .",
    "we will also show how @xmath45 and @xmath48 are obtained , given @xmath49 .",
    "thus we have determined the dissipation distance for * any @xmath2-slip system * with * symmetric dissipation functonial*.      this paper serves several purposes , therefore a few remarks concerning these seem to be in order .",
    "the main purpose is to illustrate the application of optimal control techniques and lie group methods to finite plasticity .",
    "so partly this paper is intended as a tutorial for non - specialists in optimal control on lie groups .",
    "therefore we will discuss everything in great detail and provide rigorous proofs . in this spirit",
    "this report is a successor of sussmann s and tang s paper  @xcite on the reeds - shepp - car - problem .",
    "as our factorization problem is related to the reeds - shepp - car - problem in the hyperbolic plane , our arguments and results will bear some strong resemblance with those in  @xcite .",
    "therefore we would like to stress that in this paper we put special emphasis on how to exploit the lie group structure of @xmath15 .",
    "the latter is instrumental in reducing the complexity and streamlining the discussion .",
    "moreover , it is indispensable if one s aim is to treat similar problems in @xmath15 and , eventually , in @xmath50 .",
    "as the solution of the hyperbolic reeds - shepp - car - problem requires only little extra effort , we will provide it in an appendix .",
    "although the result resembles that for the euclidean case , some aspects are different . for the geometer these are properties that distinguish hyperbolic from euclidean geometry .",
    "the interpretation as a path planning problem in the hyperbolic plane also provides a good visualization tool .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention that even if one does not care about hyperbolic geometry , one can benefit from it because some of the adhoc arguments suddenly have a simple interpretation ",
    "they might seem perfectly obscure and unmotivated , otherwise .",
    "visualization of the metric spheres ( i.e. , level sets of the factorization cost @xmath32 ) is another issue we deal with .",
    "since the group @xmath15 is three - dimensional , everything can be visualized in @xmath51 , but how ? we will use a parametrization coming from a polar decomposition , first proposed by hilgert and hofmann in  @xcite . as a set , @xmath15",
    "is identified with @xmath52 , and @xmath51 is identified with the simply connected lie group with lie algebra  @xmath4 .",
    "an advantage of this parametrization is that it immediately allows to recognize the symmetry inherent to the problem .",
    "a disadvantage is that the group operation is more complicated than matrix multiplication .",
    "the purpose of the first appendix is to collect information about this parametrization which is scattered around in the literature .",
    "this information is not necessary to understand and interprete the pictures of the metric spheres , but it is indispensible for generating them .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows :    2 . from finite plasticity to lie groups : :     +    brief outline how plasticity leads to consider metrics on lie groups .",
    "the underlying optimal control problem : : 4 .",

    "conclusion : :     +    brief outlook on future work and how to treat similar problems .",

    "then we define @xmath56 thus @xmath57 is a map from @xmath58 to @xmath53 .",
    "the map @xmath57 depends , of course , on the group @xmath53 , so one should write @xmath59 .",
    "but except for a few situations in the appendix it will always be clear from the context in which group we are working , so we omit the subscript  @xmath53 most of the time .    * acknowledgement .",
    "* this research was supported by dfg within _ sfb 404 multifield problems . _",
    "the author is grateful to alexander mielke and klaus hackl for stimulating discussions .",
    "the idea to use left - invariant metrics on lie groups in the modelling of elasto - plastic material behavior is due to mielke , cf .  @xcite . for a detailed overview of this approach",
    "we refer to  @xcite .",
    "let us quickly outline some of the main ideas of this approach .",
    "consider a body @xmath60 that undergoes a deformation @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath62 denote the deformation gradient .",
    "inelastic material behavior is described by an internal state  @xmath63 from some set @xmath64 .",
    "the whole material model is based on two scalar constitutive functions , the elastic potential  @xmath65 and the dissipation potential  @xmath66 .",
    "these give rise to an elastic storage energy and a dissipation functional .",
    "considering the evolution @xmath67 under the influence of some time - varying external forces , the total elastic and potential energy ( or gibb s energy ) at time  @xmath68 is @xmath69 the second term corresponding to the work by external forces .",
    "the dissipation  @xmath66 is supposed to depend only on the evolution of the internal state @xmath70 , i.e. , @xmath71 .",
    "one defines the dissipation distance @xmath17 as @xmath72{l } { { \\boldsymbol{z}}}(\\cdot)\\in c^1([0,1],{z}),\\\\ { { \\boldsymbol{z}}}(0)={{\\boldsymbol{z}}}_0,\\ { { \\boldsymbol{z}}}(1)={{\\boldsymbol{z}}}_1 \\end{array } } \\right\\ } } .\\ ] ] integrating over  @xmath73 one defines @xmath74 .",
    "finally the total dissipation along a path @xmath70 is defined as @xmath75)=\\sup { \\left\\ { {   \\sum_{j=1}^n { \\mathcal{d}}({{\\boldsymbol{z}}}(\\tau_j),{{\\boldsymbol{z}}}(\\tau_{j-1 } ) ) \\mid t_1=\\tau_0<\\cdots<\\tau_n = t_2 } \\right\\ } } \\ ] ] with these functionals one obtains a notion of solution processes without making any differentiability assumptions .",
    "a process @xmath67 is called a solution process over  @xmath76 $ ] if it satisfies the following two conditions : + * ( s ) stability : * @xmath77 for all @xmath78 $ ] and all comparison states @xmath79 ; + * ( e ) energy inequality : * @xmath80)\\leq { \\mathcal{e}}(t_2,{{\\boldsymbol{\\varphi}}}(t_2),{{\\boldsymbol{z}}}(t_2 ) ) -\\int_{t_1}^{t_2 } \\left\\langle \\dot{{{\\boldsymbol{\\ell}}}}(s),{{\\boldsymbol{\\varphi}}}(s)\\right\\rangle\\,{\\mathrm{d}}s.\\ ] ] this formulation does not involve any derivatives , neither of @xmath81 nor of @xmath82 . as is shown in  @xcite this formulation is consistent with classical elasto - plastic flow rules if the solution is sufficiently smooth .",
    "a particular advantage of this global formulation is that it allows to derive incremental time - stepping algorithms which are robust .",
    "so far we outlined the general approach without making any assumptions on the internal state space  @xmath64 .",
    "multiplicative elastoplasticity uses the splitting @xmath83 and considers @xmath84 as an internal variable while the elastic potential @xmath65 is supposed to depend only on @xmath85 .",
    "actually @xmath86 is used as internal state , and the internal state space  @xmath64 is a connected lie subgroup , say  @xmath53 , of @xmath87 .",
    "typically , @xmath88 , but other groups may be considered , too .",
    "the following constitutive laws are postulated :    ( sy1 ) objectivity : : :    ( frame indifference )    @xmath89    for all @xmath90 ; ( sy2 ) plastic indifference : : :    @xmath91 , +    @xmath92    for all @xmath93 ; ( sy3 ) rate independence : : :    @xmath94    for @xmath95 ;    material symmetries may be captured , for example , in a group @xmath96 . following the notation in  @xcite we postulate this as constitutive law , too :    ( sy4 ) material symmetry : : :    @xmath97 , +    @xmath98    for all @xmath99 .",
    "property  ( sy2 ) implies that the dissipation distance @xmath17 defined in the previous subsection is invariant under left - multiplication with elements from  @xmath53 , hence @xmath100 these metrics are the objects we want to study .",
    "here we dropped the material point  @xmath35 for sake of simplicity . in the sequel we will never consider dependency on  @xmath35 .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that our considerations are limited to homogeneous media .",
    "there are suitable formulations where all considerations are first limited to a fixed material point  @xmath35 , and the final result is obtained by integration over  @xmath73 , cf .",
    "@xcite      from now on we will assume that the internal state space is a connected lie group @xmath53 with lie algebra  @xmath54 .",
    "therefore we slightly change the notation .",
    "henceforth , we write @xmath101 ( instead of  @xmath102 ) . our next goal is to discuss the consequences of the constitutive laws  ( sy2 ) and  ( sy3 ) . by",
    "( sy2 ) the distance function @xmath103 $ ] is left - invariant . for the dissipation potential @xmath66",

    "therefore the definition of  @xmath111 still contains redundancy .",
    "we can reparametrize curves by their @xmath106-length .",

    "an elementary computation shows that @xmath125\\to g$ ] is parametrized by @xmath106-length , hence for @xmath126 we obtain @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 .    in the general case ( @xmath130 is possible )",
    ", @xmath118 is only monotone increasing . in that case one uses @xmath131 and shows that @xmath132 is differentiable ( although @xmath133 need not be differentiable ) .",
    "hence @xmath111 can be characterized in the following ways @xmath134{l } g\\in",

    "then the last statement says we must look for solutions of the differential inclusion @xmath136 , with boundary data @xmath137 , @xmath138 such that @xmath139 is minimal . thus computing the dissipation distance @xmath111 is equivalent to solving a time - optimal left - invariant control problem on the lie group  @xmath53 .",
    "such problems are well - studied and standard results are available , cf .",

    "the condition @xmath148 is also necessary because the set @xmath150 is nothing but the reachable set ( from  @xmath149 ) of the system @xmath136 . and if @xmath151 , this reachable set is contained in a proper subgroup of  @xmath53 .",
    "still @xmath141 for all @xmath145 may hold true under much weaker hypotheses .",
