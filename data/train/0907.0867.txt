    "the semigroup - driven ( and topologically - induced ) processes appear to have no standard langevin representation , irrespective of whether we adopt an additive or multiplicative noise . only under special circumstances",
    "a connection with the multiplicative noise has been established in ref .",
    "@xcite , but it is not a generic property of semigroup - driven processes , see e.g. also @xcite .",
    "although we formulate a framework incorporating symmetric stable processes in general , we strongly rely on a mathematical theory of the cauchy semigroup - driven processes .",
    "this theory , without any `` topological '' context , has been formulated in ref .",

    "we shall demonstrate that the langevin - driven and semigroup - driven lvy processes stay in affinity and may share common for both stationary pdf . a super - diffusive dynamical pattern of behavior is generically expected to arise .",
    "an asymptotic approach towards a stationary pdf is then in principle possible .",
    "this motivates our `` targeted stochasticity '' discussion whose original formulation for langevin - driven lvy systems can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , the reverse engineering problem being included .",
    "the necessity of considering the semigroup dynamics in this reconstruction problem points first , to an independent dynamical mechanism , and second , to the fact that only the properly tailored semigroup ( and thus the semigroup potential ) may guarantee that the prescribed invariant density actually _ is an asymptotic target of the process .",
    "this point was left aside in `` topological '' references @xcite-@xcite , where the pertinent invariant densities were postulated to have a gibbsian form , hence a tacit assumption was made about extyremely strong confining properties of the topologically - induced process . _",
    "the original reverse engineering problem reads : given a stationary pdf , can we tailor a drift function so that the system langevin dynamics would admit the predefined as an asymptotic target ?",
    "in the course of our discussion , we in fact extend the range of applicability of the original `` targeted stochasticity '' scenario and demonstrate that , for a symmetric stable driver , a priori chosen stationary pdf may serve as a target density for _ both _ langevin and semigroup - driven jump - type processes . even though their detailed dynamical patterns of behavior are different .",
    "in the near - equilibrium regime this dynamical distinction becomes immaterial .",
    "for analytically tractable and visualization insights , we shall basically refer to cauchy processes in confining potentials .    for the record we point out that the term `` equilibrium '' needs to be addressed with some care for non - gaussian processes .",
    "no physical thermalization mechanisms have ever been proposed for lvy flights .",
    "moreover , their physical `` reason '' ( origin of noise ) appears to be exterior to the physical system , with no reliable kinetic theory background , and therefore no fluctuation - dissipation response theory could have been been set for any stable noise .    to the contrary",

    "<S> we analyze confining mechanisms for lvy flights evolving under an influence of external potentials . given a stationary probability density function ( pdf ) , we address the reverse engineering problem : design a jump - type stochastic process whose target pdf ( eventually asymptotic ) equals the preselected one . to this end , </S>",
    "<S> dynamically distinct jump - type processes can be employed . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that one `` targeted stochasticity '' scenario involves langevin systems with a symmetric stable noise . </S>",
    "<S> another derives from the lvy - schrdinger semigroup dynamics ( closely linked with topologically induced super - diffusions ) , which has no standard langevin representation . for computational and visualization purposes , </S>",
