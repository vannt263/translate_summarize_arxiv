    "the possibility of achieving the control over a quantum system is the fundamental prerequisite for developing a new form of technology based on quantum effects @xcite . in particular",
    "this is an essential requirement for quantum computation , quantum communication , and more generally for all other data processing procedures that involve quantum systems as information carriers @xcite .    in many experimental settings , quantum control",
    "is implemented via an electromagnetic field interacting with the system of interest , as happens for _ cold atoms _ in optical lattices @xcite , for _ trapped ions _",
    "@xcite , for _ electrons _ in quantum dots @xcite , and actually in virtually all experiments in low energy physics . in this context",
    "the electromagnetic field can be often treated as a classical field ( in the limit of many _ quanta _ ) , allowing a semiclassical description of the control over the quantum system @xcite .",
    "furthermore in many cases of physical interest the whole process can be effectively formalized by assuming that via proper manipulation of the field parameters the experimenter produces a series of pulses implementing some specially engineered control hamiltonians from a discrete set @xmath9 .",
    "such pulses are assumed to be applied in any order , for any durations , by switching them on and off very sharply , the resulting transformation being a unitary evolution of the form @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 being the selected temporal durations ( hereafter @xmath13 is set to unity for simplicity ) @xcite . by the _ lie - algebraic rank condition _",
    "@xcite the unitary operators that can be realized via such procedure are those in the connected lie group associated to the real lie algebra @xmath14 generated by the hamiltonians @xmath9 [ where @xmath14 is formed by the real linear combinations of @xmath15 and their iterated commutators @xmath16 $ ] , @xmath17\\bm{]}$ ] , etc .",
    "] , i.e. , @xmath18 with @xmath19 . in this framework one",
    "then says that full ( unitary ) controllability is achieved if the dimension of @xmath14 is large enough to permit the implementation of all possible unitary transformations on the system , i.e. , if @xmath14 coincides with the complete algebra @xmath8 formed by self - adjoint @xmath20 complex matrices @xcite , @xmath1 being the dimension of the controlled system .    the above scheme is the paradigmatic example of what is typically identified as _ open - loop _ or _ non - adaptive _ control , where all the operations are completely determined prior to the control experiment @xcite . in other words the system is driven in the absence of an external feedback loop , i.e. , without using any information gathered ( via measurement ) _ during _ the evolution .",
    "it turns out that in quantum mechanics an alternative mechanism of non - adaptive control is available : it is enforced via quantum zeno dynamics @xcite . in this scenario , while measurements are present , the associated outcomes are not used to guide the forthcoming operations : only their effects on the system evolution are exploited ( a fact which has no analog in the classical domain ) .",
    "the underlying physical principle is the following .",
    "when a quantum system undergoes a sharp ( von neumann ) measurement , it is projected into one of the associated eigenspaces of the observable , say the space @xmath21 characterized by an orthogonal projection @xmath7 .",
    "it is then let to undergo a unitary evolution @xmath22 for a short time @xmath23 and is measured again via the same von neumann measurement . the probability to find it in a different measurement eigenspace @xmath24 orthogonal to the original one @xmath25",
    "is proportional to @xmath26 .",
    "instead , with high probability , the system remains in @xmath25 , while experiencing an effective unitary rotation of the form @xmath27 induced by the projected hamiltonian @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "accordingly , in the limit of infinitely frequent measurements performed within a fixed time interval @xmath29 , the system remains in the subspace @xmath21 , evolving through an effective _ zeno dynamics _",
    "described by the operator @xmath30    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that , by adopting the quantum zeno dynamics , the control that the experimenter can enforce on a quantum system can be greatly enhanced .",
    "for example , consider the case where the set of engineered hamiltonians contains only two commuting elements @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the associated lie algebra they generate is just two - dimensional and hence is not sufficient to induce full controllability , even for the smallest quantum system , a qubit  indeed @xmath33 = 4 $ ] . under these conditions",
    ", it turns out that for a proper choice of the projection @xmath7 it may happen that the projected counterparts @xmath34 and @xmath35 of the control hamiltonians do not commute .",
    "accordingly the lie algebra generated by @xmath36 can be much larger than the one associated with @xmath37 , and consequently the control exerted much finer .",
    "in particular the enhancement can be exponential in the system size .",
    "for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite an explicit example is given where two commuting hamiltonians @xmath31 and @xmath32 act on a chain of @xmath38 qubits , and once a proper zeno projection @xmath7 is applied on the first qubit of the chain the resulting zeno hamiltonians @xmath39 and @xmath40 generate the full algebra of traceless hermitian operators acting on the remaining @xmath41 qubits ( which is a lie algebra of dimension @xmath42 ) , thus allowing to perform any unitary operations on them .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that this is indeed a quite general phenomenon .",
    "in fact a simple argument @xcite shows that if a system is controllable for a specific choice of the parameters , then it is controllable for almost all choices of the parameters ( with respect , e.g. , to the lebesgue measure ) . in the present case",
    "it means that , for almost all choices of a rank-@xmath43 projection @xmath7 and of two commuting hamiltonians @xmath44 , the system is fully controllable in the projected subspace @xmath45 with the hamiltonians @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the aforementioned results of @xcite show that as few as two commuting hamiltonians , when projected on a smaller subspace of dimension @xmath1 through the zeno mechanism , may achieve to generate the whole lie algebra @xmath8 .",
    "the scope of the present article is to investigate the opposite question : given a set of hamiltonians @xmath48 , which are non - commuting in general , is it possible to extend them to a set of commuting hamiltonians @xmath3 from which @xmath49 can be obtained via a proper projection of the latter ( i.e. , @xmath50 ) ?",
    "we call this operation _ hamiltonian purification _ , taking inspiration from similar problems which have been investigated in quantum information . for instance",
    ", we recall that by the _ state purification _",
    "@xcite a quantum mixed state @xmath51 on a system @xmath52 is extended to a pure state @xmath53 on a system @xmath54 , from which @xmath51 can be recovered through a partial trace over the ancilla system @xmath55 .",
    "another similar result can be obtained for the _ channel purification ( stinespring dilation theorem ) _ or for the _ purification of positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) ( naimark extension theorem ) _ , according to which all the completely positive trace - preserving linear maps and all the generalized measurement procedures , respectively , can be described as unitary transformations on an extended system followed by partial trace  @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we start by presenting a formal characterization of the hamiltonian purification problem and of the associated notions of _ spanning - set purification _ and _ generator purification _ of an algebra ( see sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] ) .",
    "then we prove some theorems regarding the minimal dimension @xmath56 of the extended hilbert space needed to purify a given set of operators @xmath48 .",
    "specifically , in sec .  [ sec2 ]",
    "we analyze the case in which one is interested in purifying two linearly independent hamiltonians . in this context",
    "we provide the exact value for @xmath56 when the input hilbert space has dimension @xmath57 or @xmath58 and give lower and upper bounds for the remaining configurations . in sec .",
    "[ sec.4 ] instead we present a generic construction which allows one to put a bound on @xmath56 when the set of the operators @xmath48 contains an arbitrary number @xmath59 of linearly independent elements . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] we discuss the case in which the total number of linearly independent elements of @xmath48 is maximum , i.e. , equal to @xmath60 with @xmath1 being the dimension of the input hilbert space . under this condition",
    "we compute the exact value of @xmath56 , showing that it is equal to @xmath60 . as we shall see this corresponds to provide a spanning - set purification of the whole algebra @xmath8 in terms of the largest commutative subalgebra of @xmath61 . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : daniel ] we prove that it is always possible to obtain a generator purification of the algebra @xmath62 with an extended space of dimension @xmath63 , i.e. , in terms of the largest commutative subalgebra of @xmath64 .",
    "conclusions and perspectives are given in sec .",
    "[ sec.con ] , and the proof of a theorem is presented in the appendix .",
    "in this section we start by presenting a rigorous formalization of the problem and discuss some basic properties .",
    "let @xmath65 be a collection of @xmath59 self - adjoint operators ( hamiltonians ) acting on a hilbert space @xmath2 of dimension @xmath1 .",
    "given then a collection @xmath66 of self - adjoint operators acting on an extended hilbert space @xmath5 which includes @xmath2 as a proper subspace ( i.e. , @xmath67 ) , we say that @xmath68 provides a _ purification _ for @xmath69 if all elements of @xmath68 _ commute _ with each other , i.e. , @xmath70 = 0 ,    \\quad \\text{for all $ j , j'$ , } \\label{commm}\\ ] ] and are related to those of @xmath69 as @xmath71 where @xmath7 is the orthogonal projection onto @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the requirement ( [ commm ] ) that the operators of @xmath68 are pairwise commuting implies that such a set spans an abelian ( i.e. , commutative ) subalgebra of @xmath73 , and that @xmath15 can be simultaneously diagonalized with a single unitary operator @xmath74 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath75 with @xmath76 being real diagonal matrices .    by construction",
    ", it is clear that each one of the elements of @xmath68 in general depends upon _ all _ the operators of the set @xmath69 which one wishes to purify , and not just upon the one it extends .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath49 satisfy some special relations , identifying @xmath68 may be simpler than in the general case .",
    "for instance , if all the elements of @xmath69 admit a set of common eigenvectors , they already commute in the subspace spanned by those eigenvectors .",
    "then , we are left with the simpler problem of making the operators commute only on the complementary subspace . to keep the analysis as general as possible we will not consider these special cases in the following .",
    "we will however make use of the linearity of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) to simplify the analysis .",
    "[ lemma1 ] let @xmath77 be a collection of self - adjoint operators acting on the hilbert space @xmath2 and suppose that a purifying set @xmath78 can be constructed on @xmath5 . then",
    ":    1 .   given @xmath79 a collection of self - adjoint operators obtained by taking linear combinations of the elements of @xmath69 , i.e. , @xmath80 with @xmath81 being elements of a real rectangular @xmath82 matrix , then a purifying set for @xmath83 on @xmath5 is provided by @xmath84 with elements @xmath85 2 .",
    "any subset of linearly independent elements of @xmath69 corresponds to a subset of linearly independent elements in @xmath68 ( the opposite statement being not true in general , i.e. , linear independence among the elements of @xmath68 does not imply linear independence among the elements of @xmath69 ) ; 3 .   for @xmath86 , calling @xmath87 the identity on @xmath2 and @xmath88 the identity on @xmath5 , a purifying set for @xmath89 is given by @xmath90 4 .",
    "for any unitary @xmath91 , setting @xmath92 , a purifying set for @xmath93 is given by @xmath94    these facts are all trivially verified .",
    "property 1 of lemma [ lemma1 ] implies that a purifying set @xmath95 can be extended by linearity to a purification of any linear combinations of the elements of @xmath96 .",
    "accordingly we can say that the purification of @xmath69 by @xmath68 naturally induces a purification of the algebra spanned by the former by the algebra of the latter ( more on this in sec .",
    "[ sec : al ] ) .",
    "it is also clear that the fundamental parameter of the hamitonian purification problem is not the number of elements of @xmath69 but instead the maximum number of linearly independent elements which can be found in @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality , in the following we will assume @xmath59 to coincide with such a number , i.e. , that all the elements of @xmath69 are linearly independent .",
    "then , by property 2 of lemma [ lemma1 ] also the elements of @xmath68 share the same property . by the same token , also the normalization of the operators @xmath49 can be fixed _",
    "a priori_. property 3 can be used instead to assume that all the elements of @xmath69 be traceless ( an option which we shall invoke from time to time to simplify the analysis ) .",
    "finally property 4 can be exploited to arbitrarily fix a basis on @xmath2 , e.g. , the one which diagonalizes the first element of @xmath69 .    as we shall see in the following sections the mere possibility of finding a purification for a generic set @xmath69 can be easily proved .",
    "a less trivial issue is to determine the _ minimal _ dimension @xmath56 of the hilbert space @xmath5 which guarantees the existence of a purifying set for a generic collection @xmath69 on @xmath2 .",
    "clearly the value of @xmath56 will depend on the dimension @xmath1 of the hilbert space @xmath2 and on the number of ( linearly independent ) elements @xmath59 of the set , i.e. , @xmath97 .    by construction",
    "it is clear that this quantity can not be smaller than @xmath1 and than @xmath59 , i.e. , @xmath98 this is a simple relation which , on one side , follows from the observation that @xmath99 being an extension of @xmath2 must have dimension @xmath4 at least as large as @xmath1 . on the other side",
    "the inequality @xmath100 can be verified by exploiting the fact that the diagonal @xmath101 matrices @xmath102 entering eq .",
    "( [ diago111 ] ) must be linearly independent in order to fulfill property 2 of lemma [ lemma1 ] . actually for all",
    "non - trivial cases the inequality is strict , resulting in @xmath103 in fact when the initial hamiltonians @xmath104 do not already commute , we need to expand the dimension of the space at least by one , obtaining @xmath105 .",
    "moreover the inequality @xmath106 always holds , unless the identity @xmath87 lies in the span of @xmath104 .",
    "suppose in fact that we can purify a set of @xmath59 linearly independent hamiltonians in dimension @xmath59 ; then the linear span of the @xmath59 ( linearly independent ) diagonal matrices @xmath102 in eq .",
    "( [ diago111 ] ) includes also the identity matrix @xmath88 . because for any unitary @xmath74 we have @xmath107 , the projection of @xmath88 on @xmath2 gives the identity on that subspace , and in conclusion we have that @xmath108 .",
    "since this is not true in the general case , we obtain @xmath109 .",
    "as anticipated in the previous section the linearity property of the hamiltonian purification scheme allows us to introduce the notion of purification of an algebra .",
    "specifically there are at least two different possibilities :    [ def2 ] let @xmath110 be a lie algebra of self - adjoint operators on @xmath2 .",
    "given a commutative lie algebra @xmath111 of self - adjoint operators on @xmath5 we say that it provides    1 .",
    "a spanning - set purification ( or simply an algebra purification ) of @xmath110 when we can provide an hamiltonian purification of a spanning set ( e.g. , a basis ) of the latter in @xmath111 ; 2 .   a generator purification of @xmath110 when we can provide a hamiltonian purification of a generating set of the latter in @xmath111 .",
    "the spanning - set purification typically requires the purification of more hamiltonians than the generator purification .",
    "for instance in sec .",

    "( [ zenosequence ] ) by choosing @xmath114 to be the linear combination of commuting hamiltonians which purifies @xmath115 on @xmath116 . on the contrary , in the case of generator purification",
    ", first we have to decompose @xmath113 into a sequence of pulses of the form @xmath117 with @xmath49 being taken from the generator sets of operators for which we do have a purification .",

    "@xmath2 is finite - dimensional this implies that a purification for @xmath59 hamiltonians can always be achieved with an extended hilbert space which has at most @xmath59 times the dimension of the original one , i.e. , @xmath138 .",
    "this of course is not the best option .",
    "indeed already for @xmath57 ( qubit ) and @xmath139 , it is possible to show ( see proposition [ purif_2ops_qubit ] below ) that the purification of two arbitrary hamiltonians @xmath39 and @xmath40 is attained with a qutrit , i.e. , @xmath140 , and this is clearly the optimal solution .",
