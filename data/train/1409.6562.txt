    "dark energy ( de ) with negative pressure was considered as an exotic component causing the universe to a stage of accelerating expansion and has been widely studied  @xcite . because of the lack of knowledge about the nature of de , physicists constructed a host of viable theoretical de models . the @xmath6cdm model consisting of",
    "the cosmological constant ( @xmath6 ) and the cold dark matter ( cdm ) is the simplest one , in which de has the equation of state @xmath7 . and this elegant model is even defined as a criterion in several cosmological observations",
    ". however , the cosmological constant scenario has to face the so - called  fine - tuning problem \" and  coincidence problem \" .",
    "furthermore , different observational data are in tension with one another to some extent when constraining parameters of the @xmath6cdm model . under such circumstances ,",
    "the possibility that @xmath8 is dependent on time can not be excluded . at the present ,",
    "a number of dynamical de models have been suggested , such as quintessence  @xcite , quintom  @xcite , k - essence  @xcite , chaplygin gas  @xcite , and so on .    in face of numerous de models , it is important to discriminate various models .",
    "sahni et al .",
    "@xcite introduced the statefinder diagnostic @xmath9 , which is a geometrical diagnosis in a model - independent manner .",
    "the statefinder parameter pair @xmath9 contains the third - derivative of @xmath10 , where @xmath10 is the scale factor of the universe .",
    "since different de models exhibit different evolution trajectories in the @xmath11@xmath12 plane , and especially can be separated distinctively with the values of @xmath13 , the statefinder can be used to diagnose different de models  @xcite . besides , other diagnostics , such as @xmath14 and @xmath15  @xcite , were also used to distinguish the de models . in the previous work",
    "@xcite , we compared the holographic de models by using the statefinder pair @xmath9 . here",
    ", the holographic de models include the original holographic dark energy ( hde )  @xcite , the new holographic dark energy ( nhde )  @xcite , the new agegraphic dark energy ( nade )  @xcite , and the ricci dark energy ( rde )  @xcite , which were all proposed based on the holographic principle .",
    "all these holographic de models can be used to interpret and describe the cosmic acceleration  @xcite . by employing the statefinder diagnostic",
    "the holographic de models can be differentiated effectively in the low - redshift region  @xcite . also the holographic de models with different parameter values can be distinguished , except for the nade model .",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath17 curves of nade with different parameter values are in strong degeneracy during the whole evolution history  @xcite .    to break the degeneracy",
    ", we will take into account the statefinder hierarchy  @xcite with higher derivatives of @xmath10 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the original aim of introducing the statefinder hierarchy is to distinguish @xmath6cdm model from evolving models and to extend the null diagnostic .",
    "the statefinder hierarchy has been applied to study some dynamical de and modified gravity models ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will use this diagnostic to discriminate deeply similar dynamical de models such as the holographic type de models .",
    "today s values of statefinder parameters which can be extracted theoretically from the low - redshift observational data are helpful to differentiate de models . in this paper , the current values of the statefinders",
    "are also used to differentiate the holographic de models , and to break the degeneracy mentioned above .",
    "furthermore , the fractional growth parameter @xmath18 is also proposed as a supplement to null diagnostic  @xcite .",

    "since nade is a single - parameter model , we apply the initial condition @xmath100 at @xmath101  @xcite , and @xmath87 takes 2.5 , 2.6 and 2.7  @xcite . in rde",

    "furthermore , the difference between various values of parameter in one model can be directly identified for hde and rde in the low - redshift region , and for nhde in the range of @xmath103 . however , for nade , the cases with different parameter values degenerate highly in both the low - redshift and the high - redshift region . note that the @xmath0 diagnostic for the holographic de models has been discussed in our previous work  @xcite , and we repeat the relevant discussion in this paper for making the paper self - contained .    for breaking the degeneracy of nade , in this paper",
    "we take into account @xmath1 from the statefinder hierarchy diagnostic  @xcite , which includes the fourth - derivatives of @xmath10 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the evolutions of @xmath1 versus redshift @xmath2 for the holographic de models are plotted , and those of @xmath6cdm are also shown for comparison . from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , on one hand , the differences between the holographic de models and the @xmath6cdm model become clearer in the low - redshift region , although the curves of hde and rde degenerate with those of @xmath6cdm in the high - redshift region but which is slighter than that of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . on the other hand , it is important to see that the degeneracy in the nade model with different parameter values appearing in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is broken , and for hde , nhde , and rde models the cases with different parameter values can be discriminated more evidently in comparison with those of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the same conclusion can also be drawn from table  [ tab1 ] , in which we show the today s values of statefinders , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , and the differences of them , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , for the holographic de models , where @xmath108 and @xmath109 within one model .",
    "the current values of the statefinders also play an important role in diagnosing different de models . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] , we can see that the differences between different parameter values in one model are magnified through @xmath105 , because the values of @xmath107 are remarkably bigger than those of @xmath106 for most cases . for the nade model , @xmath110 , only slightly larger than @xmath111 , which also indicates a weak degeneracy for different parameter values .    for further comparing the statefinders @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ", we make comparisons of the holographic de models and the @xmath6cdm model in the @xmath0(@xmath2 ) plots ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) and in the @xmath1(@xmath2 ) plots ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . from these two figures , we find that the differentiable redshift region of the various de models extends from @xmath112  1 in the @xmath0(@xmath2 ) plots to @xmath112  3 in the @xmath1(@xmath2 ) plots , and @xmath1 leads to more apparent distinctions for the various de models .",
    "in addition , from table  [ tab1 ] , the current values of @xmath52 for different holographic de models separate more distinctively than those of @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , @xmath1 can diagnose different holographic de models more effectively .",
    "the above analysis shows that there still is a weak degeneracy for the nade model with different parameter values even when the @xmath1 diagnostic is employed .",
    "so we consider the conjunction of the geometrical diagnostic ( the statefinder hierarchy ) and the cosmic growth history diagnostic ( i.e. , the fractional growth parameter @xmath18 ) , instead of only using the geometrical diagnostic .",
    "acting as an alternative null diagnostic , the cnd @xmath67",
    "@xcite is studied in this paper .",
    "the evolutionary trajectories of @xmath3 for the holographic de models are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where the present - day values of @xmath113 for the models are marked by the round dots , and the fixed point @xmath56 for the @xmath6cdm model is also shown as a star for comparison .",
    "the arrows indicate the evolution directions of the models .",
    "the difference between the specific holographic de model and the @xmath6cdm model is measured by the separation of the round dot and the star , and the differences of the cases in one model with different parameter values can also be measured by the separations between the dots .",
    "we find that , by employing the cnd , @xmath3 , the differences between the evolving curves of the various holographic de models and the fixed point of @xmath6cdm are fairly evident .",
    "for the hde and the rde models , their @xmath114 values are all around 1 , but their present - day @xmath0 values are capable of differentiating their cases with different parameter values and them from @xmath6cdm . on the contrary , for the nade model , the present - day @xmath0 values are in degeneracy , but its @xmath114 values are distinctively different , so the degeneracy of nade is effectively broken by @xmath114 using the cnd @xmath3 . for the nhde model , since both the @xmath115 and the @xmath114 values are in degeneracy , discriminating the cases with different parameter values can only depend on evolutionary trajectories of @xmath113 . for a direct comparison , we also plot the evolutionary trajectories for the various holographic de models and the fixed point for the @xmath6cdm model in the @xmath0@xmath5 plane in fig .",

    "we plot the evolutionary trajectories for the holographic de models in the @xmath1@xmath5 plane in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , where the present - day values of @xmath116 for the models and the fixed point @xmath117 for @xmath6cdm are also shown as round dots and star , respectively , for directly measuring the `` effective distances '' between them .",
    "note that the dots for the current values of the nhde model are not shown in this plot owing to the fact that the present - day values of @xmath1 are too large compared to that of @xmath6cdm ( from table  [ tab1 ] , one can see that @xmath118190 for nhde ) .",
    "for the nhde model , due to the fact that @xmath119 ( see table [ tab1 ] ) , the @xmath105 values in this cnd are used to discriminate the cases of nhde with different parameter values . from this figure , one can also clearly see that , using the combination of the statefinder hierarchy @xmath1 and the fractional growth parameter @xmath5 , the degeneracy of nade can be further broken , since both @xmath107 and @xmath120 are considerable ( see also table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , employing the cnd @xmath4 , all the holographic de models under consideration can be differentiated quite well . to make a clearer comparison of them , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] the evolutionary trajectories for the various holographic de models and the fixed point for the @xmath6cdm model in the @xmath1@xmath5 plane .",
    "in this paper , we diagnose the holographic de models with the statefinder hierarchy that is essentially a series of null diagnostics . by using @xmath1 which contains fourth derivatives of @xmath10",
    ", the holographic de models are distinguished more evidently from one anther and from the @xmath6cdm model , compared to the results by using @xmath0 .",
    "the analysis of the current values of @xmath1 also indicates that the statefinder @xmath1 performs better than @xmath0 for diagnosing the holographic de models .",
    "we also consider the cnd , @xmath3 , combining the statefinder @xmath0 with the fractional growth parameter @xmath18 , and find that the cnd @xmath3 is a rather useful diagnostic approach .",
    "furthermore , we apply the cnd , @xmath4 , combining the statefinder hierarchy @xmath1 with @xmath5 , to study the holographic de models , and we find that @xmath4 is even much better than @xmath3 in discriminating the different cases within one model with different parameter values .",
    "our results demonstrate that the statefinder hierarchy containing higher derivatives of @xmath10 and the cnd are fairly useful in distinguishing the holographic de models from one another as well as from the @xmath6cdm model , and the cnd is highly efficient for breaking the degeneracies for different parameter values in one model .",

    "<S> we apply a series of null diagnostics based on the statefinder hierarchy to diagnose different holographic dark energy models including the original holographic dark energy , the new holographic dark energy , the new agegraphic dark energy , and the ricci dark energy models . </S>",
    "<S> we plot the curves of statefinders @xmath0 and @xmath1 versus redshift @xmath2 and the evolutionary trajectories of @xmath3 and @xmath4 for these models , where @xmath5 is the fractional growth parameter . combining the evolution curves with the current values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath5 , we find that the statefinder @xmath1 performs better than @xmath0 for diagnosing the holographic dark energy models . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the conjunction of the statefinder hierarchy and the fractional growth parameter is proven to be a useful method to diagnose the holographic dark energy models , especially for breaking the degeneracy of the new agegraphic dark energy model with different parameter values . </S>"
