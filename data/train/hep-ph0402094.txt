    "inclusive @xmath6-meson decays into light final - state particles , such as the semileptonic process @xmath0 and the radiative process @xmath7 , are of great importance to the determination of the cabbibo  kobayashi ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath5 and play a prominent role in the search for new physics at the @xmath6 factories .",
    "the ever increasing accuracy of experimental data on the inclusive decay rates and spectra provides a strong incentive to continuously improving the theoretical description of these processes . to keep up with the reduction of experimental errors",
    ", it will soon be necessary to have theoretical predictions for inclusive decay distributions with uncertainties below the 10% level .",
    "there are several challenges facing theorists pursuing this ambitious goal . due to experimental cuts one",
    "is generally faced with a situation where the hadronic final states are constrained to have large energy @xmath8 but only moderate invariant mass @xmath9 . in this kinematic region (",
    "called the `` shape - function region '' ) , the decay rates and spectra are obtained using a twist expansion @xcite , which is considerably more complicated than the conventional heavy - quark expansion employed in the calculation of inclusive rates for @xmath10 decays @xcite . in the twist expansion",
    ", infinite sets of power corrections are resummed into non - perturbative `` shape functions '' describing the internal structure of the @xmath6 meson . at the same time , the short - distance corrections are also more complicated than in most other applications of heavy - quark expansions , because the kinematics implies the relevance of three separated mass scales : @xmath11 ( `` hard '' ) , @xmath12 ( `` hard - collinear '' ) , and @xmath13 ( `` soft '' ) .",
    "large logarithms of ratios of these scales arise at every order in perturbation theory and must be resummed @xcite . to properly disentangle the physics associated with these scales requires a sophisticated effective field - theory machinery @xcite , which has only been fully developed recently .",
    "a systematic treatment consists of matching qcd onto soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) in a first step , in which hard quantum fluctuations are integrated out . in a second step ,",
    "scet is matched onto heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) , and hard - collinear modes are integrated out .",
    "the resulting expressions for inclusive differential decay rates have the factorized form @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath15 contains the hard corrections , the jet function @xmath16 , which describes the properties of the final - state hadronic jet , contains the hard - collinear effects , and the shape function @xmath17 accounts for the internal soft dynamics in the @xmath6 meson @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 symbol implies a convolution over a light - cone momentum variable @xmath19 associated with the residual momentum of the @xmath20 quark inside the @xmath6 meson .    up until now ,",
    "no complete next - to - leading order predictions for inclusive decay rates and spectra in the shape - function region have been presented in the literature . in the present paper we close this gap .",
    "we go beyond previous work in several important ways .",
    "first , we complete the matching calculations for the two - step matching qcd@xmath21scet@xmath21hqet at next - to - leading order in perturbation theory .",
    "we then derive renormalization - group equations governing the dependence of the functions @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 on the renormalization scale , and solve these equations analytically in momentum space .",
    "next , we derive several model - independent properties of the shape function @xmath17 , which were so far unknown .",
    "in particular , we present the precise form of the relations between renormalized shape - function moments and hqet parameters such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and we give an analytical formula for the asymptotic behavior of the shape function . an unexpected outcome of this analysis is the finding that the shape function is not positive definite , but acquires a negative radiative tail at large values of @xmath22 .",
    "we also discuss how to derive shape - function independent relations between different decay spectra , which are free of spurious landau - pole singularities .",
    "this improves on similar relations that can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "finally , we propose a new method for a high - precision determination of @xmath5 , which offers several advantages over previous approaches for extracting this important ckm parameter .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : fact ] , we present a derivation of the factorization formula for inclusive rates in the shape - function region using the position - space formulation of scet .",
    "the one - loop matching calculations needed to derive perturbative expressions for the functions @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are presented in section  [ sec : match ] . in section  [ sec : rgevol ] , we derive evolution equations for these functions and present their exact analytic solutions in momentum space .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of the properties of the shape function is given in section  [ sec : properties ] . while much of the discussion in this paper is necessarily rather technical , our results have important implications for the phenomenology of inclusive @xmath6-meson decays , including in particular the determination of @xmath5 .",
    "we have therefore organized the paper in such a way that the reader interested mainly in the applications of our formalism can skip the conceptual parts of the discussion in sections  [ sec : fact][sec : properties ] and proceed directly with section  [ sec : recap ] , where we summarize our findings and collect all formulae needed for phenomenology .",
    "the following sections  [ sec : rates ] , [ sec : relations ] , and [ sec : appls ] contain explicit predictions for various decay rates and spectra , which are of relevance to experimenters .    during the final stages of this work ,",
    "a paper by bauer and manohar appeared @xcite , which overlaps with parts of our analysis .",
    "these authors derive expressions for the hard - scattering kernels , the jet function , and the renormalized shape function which agree with our results reported in ( [ hres ] ) , ( [ jrescale ] ) , and ( [ sonshell ] ) below .",
    "they also obtain an expression for the anomalous dimension of the shape function , which coincides with our result in ( [ ourgamma ] ) .",
    "in many other aspects our analysis goes beyond that of @xcite .",
    "in particular , using a technique published some time ago by two of us @xcite , we succeed to obtain an exact analytic solution of the evolution equation for the shape function in momentum space . at",
    "leading - logarithmic order we confirm an expression found earlier by balzereit , mannel , and kilian ( apart from a small mistake ) @xcite .",
    "while in @xcite resummed expressions are only given for large-@xmath23 moments of decay spectra , we present results for arbitrary decay distributions in physical phase space .",
    "we also disagree with bauer and manohar on the conclusion that moments of the renormalized shape function can not be related to hqet parameters .",
    "in fact , we derive the explicit form of such relations .",
    "using the optical theorem , the hadronic physics relevant to the inclusive semileptonic decay @xmath0 can be related to a hadronic tensor @xmath24 defined via the discontinuity of the forward @xmath6-meson matrix element of a correlator of two flavor - changing weak currents @xmath25 @xcite .",

    ", the current correlator can be evaluated using a short - distance expansion .",
    "the simplest case arises if all components of @xmath34 . integrating out the light - quark propagator then produces bilocal operators of the form @xmath35 with @xmath36 , which can be expanded in terms of local operators @xmath37 multiplied by coefficient functions @xmath38 .",
    "performing the integration over @xmath39 gives functions @xmath40 depending on the different short - distance scales @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6-meson matrix elements of the local operators @xmath37 can be evaluated using techniques of hqet @xcite .",
    "thus , the operator product expansion produces an expansion in inverse powers of the heavy - quark mass .",
    "this expansion is relevant to the computation of inclusive decay rates without restrictive cuts on kinematic variables .",
    "such rates are governed by parton kinematics as imprinted through the dependence on the jet momentum @xmath41 .",
    "the unique operator of lowest dimension is @xmath42 ( with @xmath43 the effective heavy - quark field in hqet ) , whose forward matrix element between @xmath6-meson states is unity .",
    "the wilson coefficient of this operator has been computed to @xmath44 in @xcite . at next - to - leading order in the heavy - quark expansion",
    "two new operators arise , which correspond to the kinetic energy and chromo - magnetic interaction of a heavy quark .",
    "their wilson coefficients have been computed at tree level in @xcite .",
    "a more complicated situation arises in the region of phase space in which the energy of the hadronic final states is much larger than its invariant mass , meaning that some components of the vector @xmath45 are much larger than others . in this case",
    ", the current correlator can be expanded in non - local light - cone operators @xcite .",
    "the formalism is most transparent when presented using the language of soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite . to simplify the kinematics",
    "it is convenient to work in the @xmath6-meson rest frame , where @xmath46 , and to choose the lepton momentum @xmath47 along the negative @xmath48-axis , so that @xmath49 points in the @xmath48 direction .",

    "we refer to a momentum with these scaling properties as `` hard - collinear '' . the appropriate effective field theory for integrating out the short - distance fluctuations associated with the hard scale @xmath63",
    "is called scet@xmath64 and has been discussed in detail in the literature @xcite . here",
    "we use the coordinate - space formulation of scet developed in @xcite .    below a matching scale @xmath65",
    ", the semileptonic current can be expanded as @xmath66 where the dots denote higher - order terms in the scet expansion , which can be neglected at leading power in @xmath67 .",
    "the soft heavy - quark field @xmath68 and the hard - collinear light - quark field @xmath69 are scet building blocks that are invariant under a set of homogeneous soft and hard - collinear gauge transformations @xcite .",

    "soft fields in scet are multi - pole expanded and only depend on the minus component of the position vector @xmath39 .",
    "finally , the position - space wilson coefficient functions @xmath72 depend on the variable @xmath73 defining the position of the hard - collinear field . here and below we denote functions in position space with a tilde , which is omitted from the corresponding fourier - transformed functions in momentum space . a convenient basis of dirac structures in ( [ current ] ) is @xmath74 the current correlator in ( [ wandtdef ] ) then becomes @xmath75 in a second step , the hard - collinear fluctuations associated with the light - quark jet can be integrated out by matching scet onto hqet at an intermediate scale @xmath76 . at leading order the scet lagrangian ( when written in terms of the gauge - invariant fields such as @xmath77 ) does not contain interactions between hard - collinear and soft fields .",
    "since the external @xmath6-meson states only contain soft constituents , we can take the vacuum matrix element over the hard - collinear fields , defining a jet function @xmath78 where @xmath79 are color indices , and we have used translational invariance to determine the dependence on the coordinate vectors . at higher orders in scet power counting , additional jet functions would arise , but their contributions can be neglected at leading power .",
    "shifting the integration variable from @xmath39 to @xmath80 , with @xmath81 , and introducing the fourier - transformed wilson coefficient functions @xmath82 we then obtain @xmath83 in the next step , we rewrite the bilocal heavy - quark operator as @xcite @xmath84 where @xmath85 may be an arbitrary ( even @xmath48-dependent ) dirac structure , and we have used the property @xmath86 of the soft wilson line @xmath70 , where @xmath87 is the covariant derivative with respect to soft gauge transformations . when this expression is used in ( [ t1 ] ) , the resulting formula for the correlator involves the fourier transform of the jet function , @xmath88 however with @xmath45 replaced by the combination @xmath89 . in defining the momentum - space jet function @xmath90 we have taken into account that the matrix element in ( [ jdef ] )",

    "the derivation presented above is equivalent to a proof of this formula presented in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the limits of integration in the convolution integral are determined by the facts that the jet function defined in ( [ jetdef ] ) has support for @xmath106 , and the shape function defined in ( [ sdef ] ) has support for @xmath107 with @xmath108 , where @xmath1 is the heavy - quark pole mass .",
    "the argument @xmath109 of the jet function can be rewritten as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the 4-momentum of the hadronic final state , and the variable @xmath112 .",

    "the usefulness of this variable has also been emphasized in @xcite .",
    "we shall see below that expressing the convolution integral in terms of the new variable @xmath114 eliminates any spurious dependence of the decay spectra on the @xmath20-quark pole mass .",
    "it follows that in the shape - function region the hadronic tensor is most naturally written as a function of the `` parton variable '' @xmath115 and the `` hadron variable '' @xmath116 , and the inclusive spectra are governed by a combination of parton and hadronic kinematics .",
    "using the fact that the wilson coefficients @xmath117 are real and hence @xmath118 is symmetric in its indices , we find @xmath119 this result may be compared with the general lorentz decomposition of the hadronic tensor given in @xcite : @xmath120 we see that the structure function @xmath121 is not generated at leading order in the scet expansion . since only the wilson coefficient @xmath122 is non - zero at tree - level , the structure function @xmath123 receives leading - power contributions at tree level , whereas @xmath124 and @xmath125 receive leading - power contributions at @xmath126 . the function @xmath127 receives leading - power contributions only at @xmath128 , which is beyond the accuracy of a next - to - leading order calculation .",

    ", we should therefore omit the term in ( [ bermuda ] ) , which can be done by replacing all occurrences of @xmath508 in upper integration limits in ( [ ftrian ] ) and ( [ g2g3 ] ) with @xmath509 . only in that way",
    "we ensure that our calculations provide the unique leading - power contribution in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "we will use this prescription in our numerical analysis in section  [ sec : appls ] .    because of the presence of power corrections from a region in phase space where the collinear expansion breaks down , it is not clear to us how one would construct a systematic heavy - quark expansion for the fraction @xmath505 beyond the leading order .",
    "clarification of this point deserves further study .",
    "bauer et al .  have proposed to reduce the sensitivity to shape - function effects in the extraction of @xmath5 by combining a cut on hadronic invariant mass with a cut @xmath510 on the invariant mass squared of the lepton pair @xcite .",

    "it is straightforward to study the effects of such a combined cut in the approximation where radiative corrections are neglected . for the corresponding event fraction at tree level ,",
    "we obtain @xmath511 where @xmath512 , and @xmath491 as above . for a fixed hadronic - mass cut @xmath513 , the effect of the cut on @xmath514 is to broaden the support of the first integral , while at the same time reducing its weight due to the prefactor .",
    "to illustrate this point , we show in the second plot in figure  [ fig : combined ] the weight functions under the integral with the shape function for three different choices of @xmath515 .",
    "the sensitivity to the precise form of the shape function is reduced because the weight functions become progressively more shallow as the value of @xmath516 is raised . however",
    ", this reduction comes at the price of a significant reduction of the rate , raising questions about the validity of the assumption of quark  hadron duality .",
    "we will see in section  [ sec : appls ] that the _ relative _ uncertainty due to shape - function effects is not strongly reduced when imposing an additional cut on @xmath514 .",
    "we are therefore not convinced that it is worth paying this price .      before concluding this section ,",
    "let us comment on results for inclusive @xmath6-decay spectra in the shape - function region previously published in the literature .",
    "detailed predictions for @xmath0 decay distributions including shape - function effects were presented in @xcite and @xcite . in these papers , @xmath44 corrections",
    "were included at the level of the underlying parton spectra . in the last reference",
    "fully differential distributions are presented , which can be used to calculate arbitrary spectra and implement experimental cuts .",
    "dedicated studies of the hadronic invariant mass spectrum can also be found in @xcite .",
    "similar analyses for the photon energy spectrum in @xmath7 decays were presented in @xcite . in all these works ,",
    "shape - function effects are implemented by convolving parton - model distributions with a primordial structure function , typically by replacing the @xmath20-quark mass in expressions for the parton spectra by a new variable @xmath517 @xcite .",
    "this procedure is correct at tree level .",
    "however , it is no longer fully consistent when radiative corrections are included , because part of the @xmath44 corrections in the expressions for parton - level spectra are absorbed into the renormalization of the shape function .",
    "in particular , this changes the sign of the leading sudakov logarithm , as can be seen by comparing the coefficients of the @xmath518 terms in ( [ fulvia ] ) and ( [ jres ] ) .",
    "this point has also been emphasized in @xcite .",
    "an attempt to include radiative corrections to the spectra in a systematic way was made in @xcite , where in particular the evolution of the shape function has been addressed .",
    "since our evolution equation does not agree with the one found by this author @xcite , our results for decay spectra are also in disagreement .    in @xcite ,",
    "an expression has been presented for the double differential rate in the variables @xmath412 and @xmath519 , which ( apart from a typo ) is consistent with our findings . however , in this paper no distinction between @xmath520 and @xmath521 has been made in the next - to - leading order corrections , which entails significant perturbative uncertainties . also , the important question of a physical definition of the @xmath20-quark mass has not been addressed .",
    "whereas in our case all quantities are defined in a physical subtraction scheme and no reference to the @xmath20-quark mass is left in the final expressions for decay distributions ( except as arguments of running couplings ) , the results of @xcite contain explicit reference to the @xmath20-quark pole mass .",
    "the decay spectra and event fractions discussed in the previous section are given in terms of weighted integrals of perturbative expressions with a non - perturbative shape function , which encodes hadronic physics related to the bound - state properties of the @xmath6 meson .",
    "to use these formulae , one must take recourse to a model for the shape function , or ( better ) extract the shape function from a fit to experimental data .",
    "alternatively , it is possible to derive model - independent relations between different decay distributions in which the shape function has been eliminated @xcite .",
    "this makes use of the fact that at leading power in @xmath67 shape - function effects in inclusive decays to light hadronic final states are described by a single universal ( i.e. , process independent ) function .",
    "the most promising strategy is to relate event fractions in semileptonic @xmath0 decays to a weighted integral over the @xmath7 photon spectrum , which at present provides the most direct access to the shape function .",
    "while it is straightforward to derive such relations at tree level , radiative corrections introduce non - trivial complications @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we illustrate with a concrete example how such shape - function independent relations can be derived systematically within our framework . since our formalism has yet to be applied to the @xmath7 photon spectrum , we will instead derive a relation between the charged - lepton energy spectrum and a weighted integral over the @xmath424 spectrum in @xmath0 decays .",
    "this relation serves as a prototype for all other shape - function independent relations between partially integrated decay rates .",
    "note that the properties of the @xmath424 distribution are very similar to those of the @xmath7 photon spectrum in the sense that , at tree level , both spectra are directly given in terms of the shape function , e.g.@xmath522 .",
    "this connection , and its potential usefulness for an extraction of @xmath5 , has been noted earlier in @xcite .",
    "specifically , we wish to construct a _ perturbative _ weight function @xmath523 such that at leading power in @xmath67 @xmath524 this relation is independent of the shape function and hence insensitive to hadronic physics .",

    "the weight function is formally independent of the scale @xmath201 , because there is nothing to cancel a potential @xmath201 dependence in ( [ raterel ] ) .",
    "this fact can also be shown explicitly using the formulae given above . expanding the resummed result for the weight function to first order in @xmath131 , we obtain the simple expression @xmath530 , \\ ] ] in which the dependence on @xmath201 has canceled .",
    "however , since this formula contains a large logarithm and the scale to be used in @xmath131 is undetermined , it should not be used for phenomenological applications .",

    "the three curves refer to different values of the scale @xmath201 .",
    "the stability with respect to variations of the intermediate scale is very good except for the case of a very low scale ( @xmath532gev ) , for which the convergence of perturbation theory is expected to be poor .",

    "have presented a form for the weight function in a relation between the resummed @xmath7 and @xmath0 decay rates , in which the kinematic variables corresponding to @xmath424 and @xmath533 above enter in a most complicated form @xcite .",
    "their result has the unattractive feature that the integral over the weight function contains a landau - pole singularity , which must be avoided by introducing a cutoff on the @xmath424 integral on the right - hand side of ( [ raterel ] )",
    ". a simpler form of the weight function , which is equivalent to ( [ w1loop ] ) and contains only a single logarithm of the kinematic variables , has been promoted in @xcite .",
    "our exact result ( [ wfun ] ) obtained after renormalization - group improvement retains a simple form with only a single logarithm .",
    "note , in particular , that our result does not exhibit any unphysical landau singularities .",
    "we believe the resolution of the discrepancy has to do with the choice of the intermediate matching scale @xmath201 .",
    "since the weight function is formally independent of @xmath201 , we are free to choose any value @xmath76 . taking the particular choice @xmath534 would eliminate the logarithmic term in ( [ wfun ] ) , however at the price of introducing a very complicated dependence on the kinematic variables @xmath533 and @xmath424 via the dependence of the weight function on the quantity @xmath535 $ ] .",
    "also , with this choice the weight function would develop a landau pole singularity at the point where the coupling @xmath536 gets strong , which happens for @xmath537 .",
    "all these unwanted features are avoided by using a fixed value for the intermediate scale , as we did in ( [ wfun ] ) .",
    "we are now ready to study the implications of our analysis for phenomenology .",
    "we start by deriving the numerical values for the shape - function mass and kinetic energy including errors .",
    "we then present a model for the shape function which satisfies all theoretical constraints , and study its behavior under renormalization - group evolution .",
    "finally , we present numerical results for the various decay rates and spectra investigated in section  [ sec : rates ] .    throughout this paper",

    "a value for the shape - function mass can be obtained by combining the relations ( [ msfmpole ] ) or ( [ msfmps ] ) with existing predictions for the @xmath20-quark mass in the relevant renormalization schemes .",
    "the potential - subtracted mass at the scale @xmath548gev has been determined from moments of the @xmath549 cross section and the mass of the @xmath550 state @xcite . using the first relation in ( [ msfmps ] ) , the result of this paper implies @xmath551gev . from a similar analysis",
    "the kinetic mass has been determined at the scale @xmath548gev to be @xmath552gev @xcite . from the second relation in ( [ msfmps ] ) it then follows that @xmath553gev . using relation ( [ mustar ] ) to compute the scale dependence of the shape - function mass , we obtain at the intermediate scale the values @xmath554gev and @xmath555gev , respectively .",

    "it is quite remarkable that these different determinations of the shape - function mass , which use rather different physics input , give highly consistent results . combining them ,",
    "we quote our default value for the shape - function mass at the intermediate scale @xmath540gev as @xmath558 the corresponding @xmath2 parameter is @xmath559gev .",

    "we report the fractions of the contained @xmath0 events and indicate how these fractions vary under the variation of the shape - function models . in all cases the goal is to reject the charm background as efficiently as possible , while preserving a sufficiently large fraction of the signal events so as to obtain a reliable determination of the ckm matrix element @xmath5 .",
    "we emphasize that our results refer to the leading term in the heavy - quark expansion , and that the rates are expected to be modified somewhat by power corrections .",
    "the uncertainties quoted on the contained event fractions reflect their sensitivity to shape - function effects only .",
    "no other theoretical uncertainties are included in these estimates .",
    "the first portion of the table contains results for the event fractions with a cut on hadronic invariant mass .",
    "the first line corresponds to the `` ideal '' cut @xmath486 , which in theory eliminates the charm background entirely .",
    "this cut retains about 80% of all @xmath0 events . in practice ,",
    "spill - over from final states containing charm hadrons in a realistic measurement requires to lower the cut on hadronic invariant mass to values slightly below @xmath487 .",
    "two typical choices are also covered in the table .",
    "lowering the cut reduces the contained event fraction by modest amounts , while the sensitivity to shape - function effects increases markedly . yet ,",
    "even with a cut at 1.55gev the uncertainty on @xmath5 would still amount to only 4% .",
    "the second portion of the table shows two examples of cuts on the hadronic light - cone momentum @xmath424 . with",
    "the `` ideal '' cut @xmath430 about 80% of all events are contained , which is as good as with the hadronic invariant mass cut .",
    "the sensitivity to shape - function effects is somewhat more pronounced but still at a very acceptable level .",
    "the corresponding uncertainty on @xmath5 is about 5% .",
    "since the @xmath424 spectrum is directly related to the photon energy spectrum in @xmath7 decays , this uncertainty can be reduced further by using experimental information on the photon spectrum . due to the fact that there is a `` buffer zone '' separating the signal events from the charm background , we expect less spill - over than in the case of a cut on hadronic invariant mass .",
    "it may therefore be experimentally feasible to implement the cutoff near the optimal value .",
    "however , even if the value of @xmath467 must be lowered by a small amount , the efficiency remains high and the shape function sensitivity at an acceptable level ( see the second entry in the table ) .",
    "the third portion of the table shows results for the case of a cut on the energy of the charged lepton .",
    "the efficiency is obviously much reduced in this case , even if the cut can be relaxed into the region where some charm background is present ( second entry ) .",
    "the theoretical calculations are therefore more prone to uncertainties from other effects such as weak annihilation @xcite .    in the lower portion of the table we give results for some combined cuts on hadronic and leptonic invariant mass , which have been briefly discussed in section  [ sec : comb ] .",
    "contrary to the other cases , these numbers refer to the tree - level approximation and so should be taken with caution .",
    "for reference , we quote again the ( tree - level ) result for the pure hadronic invariant mass cut , which differs significantly from the corresponding result including radiative corrections .",
    "while the additional cut on leptonic @xmath514 reduces the shape - function sensitivity , it comes along with a strong reduction of the efficiency .",
    "for instance , the combined cut @xmath577gev and @xmath578gev@xmath561 employed in a recent analysis of the belle collaboration @xcite has an efficiency of about 33% ( at tree level and leading order in @xmath67 ) , which is much smaller than the efficiency of the pure hadronic invariant mass cut @xmath577gev . however , the sensitivity to shape - function effects is only slightly better in the case of the combined cut .    as a final remark ,",
    "let us comment on the applicability of the theoretical framework developed in this work .",
    "according to figure  [ fig : phase ] most of the @xmath0 events are located in the shape - function region of large @xmath422 and small to moderate @xmath424 .",
    "our approach is based on a systematic heavy - quark expansion valid in that region of phase space .",
    "it allows us to calculate inclusive decay rates integrated over domains @xmath579 and @xmath580 , where typically @xmath581 .",
    "( in the examples above , @xmath582 , @xmath467 , or @xmath583 , respectively . )",
    "while the corresponding predictions for decay spectra and event fractions are sufficient to analyse experimental data over most of the phase space relevant to measurements of the ckm matrix element @xmath5 , it would be of interest to extend the validity of the theoretical description outside the shape - function region . in the case where @xmath584 are both large",
    ", the decay spectra can be computed using a local operator product expansion .",
    "an interesting question is whether it will be possible to match these two approaches in some intermediate region of @xmath585 values that are numerically ( but not parametrically ) large compared with @xmath13 .",
    "if the two predictions were to agree in an overlap region , this could be used to construct a theoretical description of inclusive @xmath0 decay distributions that is valid over the entire phase space .",
    "while this is an exciting prospect , we note that performing a systematic operator product expansion in the overlap region is far from trivial . because of the hierarchy of scales @xmath586 , again a two - step procedure is in order .",
    "an example of such an approach can be found in @xcite .",
    "we have calculated differential spectra and partially integrated event fractions for the inclusive semileptonic decays @xmath0 at next - to - leading order in renormalization - group improved perturbation theory , and at leading power in the heavy - quark expansion .",
    "the hadronic tensor entering the differential decay rates has been factorized into perturbatively calculable hard and jet functions , @xmath118 and @xmath16 , which we give to one - loop order , and a universal shape function @xmath17 containing non - perturbative physics below an intermediate scale @xmath76 .",
    "this factorization has been obtained by matching qcd onto soft - collinear effective theory to integrate out hard fluctuations of order @xmath1 , and by matching the result further onto heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) to integrate out hard - collinear modes at the intermediate mass scale .",
    "large logarithms have been resummed by solving the renormalization - group equation for the hard kernels , evolving the functions @xmath118 from the hard scale @xmath65 down to the intermediate scale @xmath201 . in order to make use of the resulting expression for the hadronic tensor ,",
    "the shape function is needed at this intermediate scale @xmath201 .",
    "we have derived the anomalous dimension of the shape function at one - loop order and given an exact analytic solution of the resulting renormalization - group equation .",
    "our solution can be applied to any model for the shape function obtained at any scale . alternatively , if the shape function is treated as a phenomenological quantity , renormalizing it at the scale @xmath201 avoids doing perturbation theory at a low hadronic scale .",
    "moments of the shape function are often identified with hqet parameters such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this identification was so far only understood at tree level .",
    "we have discovered the appearance of a radiative tail of the shape function that vanishes slower than @xmath587 .",
    "this feature renders all shape - function moments ( including the normalization integral ) ultra - violet divergent .",
    "to define the moments consistently we have introduced a hard ultra - violet cutoff @xmath315 on the integrals over @xmath19 .",
    "this is natural , since in any physical process the shape function will only be integrated over a finite interval .",
    "the dependence of the moments on this cutoff can be controlled using a local operator product expansion , which has enabled us to derive reliable perturbative relations between shape - function moments and hqet parameters .",
    "we have also obtained a formula for the normalization integral over the shape function as a function of @xmath315 , and from it a model - independent prediction for the asymptotic behavior of the shape function for large values of @xmath22 .",
    "surprisingly , this analysis reveals that the shape function has a negative tail and so is not positive definite , contrary to common expectation .    due to the fact that the @xmath20-quark pole mass , and with it the hqet parameter @xmath2 , suffers from infra - red renormalon ambiguities ,",
    "it is favorable to replace @xmath341 by a short - distance mass defined in a physical subtraction scheme .",
    "we have argued that the most natural definition for applications to inclusive spectra is to define a `` shape - function mass '' @xmath588 by enforcing that the first moment of the renormalized shape function vanish for any given value of the cutoff @xmath315 .",
    "the dependence of the shape - function mass on the cutoff @xmath315 and on the dimensional regularization scale @xmath194 is controlled by evolution equations , which can be trusted as long as both scales are much larger than @xmath13 .",
    "using a similar approach , we have defined a running kinetic - energy parameter @xmath589 in the shape - function scheme , which can be used to replace the ( ambiguous ) hqet parameter @xmath3 .",
    "we relate our new parameters to some previous , physical definitions of @xmath1 and @xmath371 .",
    "all of these new insights restrict model building of the shape function drastically .",
    "we give expressions for some model shape functions that are fully consistent with all constraints , albeit leaving enough freedom to accommodate future experimental constraints from the @xmath7 photon spectrum .    in the second part of the paper we have applied our results to make predictions for several interesting @xmath0 decay distributions and spectra in the shape - function region of large hadronic energy ( @xmath8 ) and small hadronic invariant mass ( @xmath590 . we have presented results for event fractions with cuts on the charged - lepton energy , hadronic invariant mass , or hadronic light - cone momentum @xmath4 , where in each case the cuts are chosen so as to reject background from @xmath10 decays . these formulae are presented as convolution integrals of weight functions with the shape function renormalized at the intermediate scale @xmath201 .",
    "our results are valid at next - to - leading order in renormalization - group improved perturbation theory and at leading power in the heavy - quark expansion .",

    "an important outcome of our phenomenological analysis is the finding that a cut @xmath476gev on the hadronic light - cone momentum eliminates the charm background while containing the vast majority of all @xmath0 events . at",
    "leading power in @xmath67 this cut has an efficiency of about 80% , which is almost as efficient as the cut @xmath486 on hadronic invariant mass .",
    "a cut on @xmath424 offers several advantages over a cut on hadronic invariant mass .",
    "first , it provides a `` buffer zone '' against charm background , which borders the signal region at only a single point in phase space .",
    "secondly , the hadronic physics affecting the @xmath424 spectrum is directly related to the hadronic physics affecting the @xmath7 photon energy spectrum ( the two spectra are identical at tree level ) .",
    "this implies that a simple , shape - function independent relation between the two distributions can be derived , which could be used to eliminate hadronic uncertainties ( at least at leading power in @xmath67 ) .",
    "finally , as we have pointed out , the calculation of the hadronic invariant mass distribution suffers from the fact that it includes a region in phase space where the collinear expansion breaks down .",
    "while this region gives only a power - suppressed contribution to the rate , its presence might cause complications if the calculation is taken beyond the leading power .",
    "the @xmath424 spectrum , on the other hand , can be accurately calculated beyond the leading order using the methods developed here .",
    "it would be a most useful quantity to measure .",
    "using our formalism , shape - function independent relations between different decay distributions can be derived in a systematic way , and they are free of unphysical landau singularities . as an example , we have derived a relation between the charged - lepton energy spectrum and a weighted integral over the @xmath424 spectrum in @xmath0 decays .",
    "this formula serves as a prototype for other relations , including the more useful relation between the @xmath424 spectrum and the photon energy spectrum in @xmath7 decays , which can be used for a new , high - precision determination of @xmath5 once the technology developed in this paper has been applied to @xmath7 decays .",
    "finally , let us reiterate that the results presented here are valid at leading power in @xmath67 .",
    "while it may be laborious to calculate the next term in the expansion , this can be systematically done in our formalism ( with the possible exception of the hadronic invariant mass spectrum ) , and we believe it must be done in order to achieve a theoretical accuracy in the prediction of decay spectra at the 10% level .",
    "if this level of precision can be achieved , it would for the first time lead the way toward a precision measurement of the ckm matrix element @xmath5 with a theoretical error at the 5% level .",
    "this would be worth the effort .",
