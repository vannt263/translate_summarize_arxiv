    "presently , it is well known that information has become the most important resource leading to many major paradigm shifts . the realization has now emerged that the processing of information can not be separated from the underlying fundamental physics and that the physical aspects of information processing must be taken into consideration .",
    "this has led to a new understanding of the information processing , cryptography , and the methods and techniques used for communication @xcite that is based on the rules of quantum theory @xcite .",
    "a venue where information plays a central role is in the playing of games for which the established branch of mathematics called game theory binmore , rasmusen , osborne provides the necessary analytic tools , methods , and solution concepts .",
    "any analysis of games is based on some fundamental assumptions relating to what information is available to each participating player at a particular stage of the game .",
    "the finding that physical aspects can have crucial role in the information processing has natural implications for playing of games and considerations of the underlying fundamental physics become important also for game theory .",

    "is that quantum strategies result in outcomes that can defy our classical intuition .",
    "the speed with which new quantum technologies are emerging suggest that soon it would be usual to take full advantage of quantum theory and using quantum strategies in order to beat an opposing player at some realistic game that uses quantum technology .",
    "also , there are suggestions that quantum games can potentially provide new insights into the rise of complexity and self - organization at the molecular level where the rules are dictated by quantum mechanics @xcite .    in the area of quantum games a well known quantization scheme for bimatrix games",

    "@xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "the players s strategies or actions , are particular local unitary transformations performed on an initial entangled state @xmath0 in @xmath1 hilbert space .",

    "players payoff relations contain four quantum probabilities obtained by projecting the final quantum state onto the basis vectors and are expressed in terms of players local unitary transformations and the projection postulate of quantum mechanics .",
    "consideration of the four quantum probabilities in the player payoff relations leads to the question of whether the payoff relations in the quantum game can also be understood terms of player mixed strategies in the classical game .",
    "this is reminiscent of the situation when quantum probabilities are factorizable where one can express the quantum probabilities in terms of player mixed strategies .",
    "it turns out that factorizability of quantum probabilities presents a set of strong relations . in this paper",

    "<S> a quantum game - theoretic setting enables the analysis of strategic interaction among agents with access to quantum resources . </S>",
    "<S> one of the original motivations for re - expressing quantum algorithms , and quantum communication protocols , in terms of competing quantum agents was to provide new insights into their workings . </S>",
    "<S> looking closely , one finds that quantum strategic interactions utilize quantum probabilities and such probabilities are realizable in quantum mechanical experiments that allow implementation of unitary transformations , quantum measurements etc . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents a perspective on a quantum game - theoretic framework involving quantum probabilities , which are not subject to the strong factorizability constraints that classical probabilities are found to possess . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that a quantum version of a classical game can be obtained more directly if we replace the factorizability relations for probabilities in a classical game with two weaker constraints that are also obeyed by the quantum probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions of symmetric bimatrix games with such ` non - factorizable ' probabilities are then analyzed and compared to the solutions that appear in the standard version of a quantum game . </S>"
