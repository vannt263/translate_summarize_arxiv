    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is a unique machine designed to create a very high energy density over an extended region as a result of nuclei collisions .",
    "this process enables to investigate the collective phenomena in quantum chromodynamics .",
    "in particular , one hopes to create the quark - gluon plasma which is the state of deconfined quarks and gluons . according to cosmology such state existed at the very early universe .",
    "rhic machine is capable of accelerating and colliding different hadronic systems : proton - proton , nucleus - nucleus , deutron - nucleus at a wide range of centre - of - mass energies , from @xmath0 to @xmath1 per nucleon pair . just after the collision",
    ", a very high quantity of quarks and gluons is created .",
    "it is estimated that , the formation time for the initial density is about @xmath2 .",
    "after that , the system thermalizes very quickly and reaches thermodynamic equillibrium .",
    "estimates suggest that this happens rather quickly , with very short thermalization times of the order of @xmath3 .",
    "the assumption of thermalization is vital for the application of the hydrodynamics @xcite which is used to describe the expansion of the system .",
    "when the system expands and cools down , the quarks and gluons form hadrons which finally reach the detectors .",
    "the phase transition from the quark - gluon plasma to hadrons occurs at rather large value of strong coupling which is beyond the applicability of the perturbative methods .",
    "nevertheless , one can explore thermodynamic properties of qcd using lattice methods , see for example @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ karsch ] we show the result of the lattice calculations @xcite for the energy density divided by @xmath4 as a function of temperature .",
    "the results clearly show the phase transition at the critical temperature @xmath5 of about @xmath6 .",
    "the critical energy density corresponding to this temperature is about @xmath7 .",
    "the energy density at rhic @xcite can be calculated from the transverse energy density at midrapidity via bjorken formula : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the overlap area for the colliding nuclei .",
    "the average energy density depends crucially on the estimates of the time @xmath10 at which it is evaluated . for thermalization times in the range",
    "@xmath11 the average energy density is about @xmath12 .",
    "this is well above the critical density obtained from lattice calculations , compare fig .",
    "[ karsch ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that , the energy density of the cold nuclear matter is about @xmath13 . in fig .",
    "[ karsch ] the energy densities probed by rhic and lhc are also indicated .",
    "notably , the calculations signal that already at sps energies , the transition from hadron phase to quark - gluon plasma occured .",
    "lattice calculations enable to probe the phase diagram of qcd , shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ phase_diagram ] .",
    "the vertical axis is the temperature @xmath14 and the horizontal one is the baryo - chemical potential .     as a function of the temperature .",
    "the blue arrow with @xmath15 is the stefan - boltzman limit .",
    "figure by f.  karsch @xcite.,width=283 ]    the region above the dashed - solid lines is the quark - gluon plasma phase , whereas the region below , at small temperatures and baryo - chemical potential , is the hadron phase .",
    "the transition between the two is a smooth crossover .",
    "both rhic and lhc probe the quark - gluon phase and the transition region at small values of the baryon chemical potential .",
    "further to the right , for higher values of the baryo - chemical potential the critical endpoint is expected and the transition becomes of the 1st order . at high values of the baryo - chemical potential and smaller temperatures ,",
    "new phase appears , the color superconductor .",
    "this phase is not accessible at the high energy colliders .",
    "the fact that rhic reached quark - gluon plasma domain in the nucleus - nucleus collisions suggest that , at least in some of the measured observables , one can expect to see dramatic effects as compared with proton - proton collisions . in reality",
    "the situation is quite complicated .",
    "indeed , large differences are seen , for example the suppression of @xmath16 distributions at large values of the transverse momenta with respect to the ( scaled ) proton - proton collisions . on the other hand ,",
    "bulk properties , like total multiplicities and rapidity distributions , have quite similar shapes and energy dependences as compared with the scaled proton - proton measurements .",
    "we are going to review some of the observations performed at rhic and discuss the phenomenological descriptions .",
    "in fig .  [ tot_mult ] from @xcite the measurements of the total multiplicity in @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 collisions , scaled by the number of participating nucleon pairs @xmath20 are shown as a function of the increasing energy .",
    "the smooth rise with energy is well described by the @xmath21 behavior over wide range of the energies .",
    "what is striking , is the fact that the data for scaled multiplicity for nucleus - nucleus collisions lie on top of the data points for @xmath19 collisions .",
    "proton - proton data lie lower , most probably due to the leading particle effect . in the @xmath22(@xmath23 ) collisions , lots of the energy is taken by the quark spectators into the forward region , and only a fraction of the energy is used for the production of the secondary particles .",
    "the proton - proton data can be superimposed onto the nucleus - nucleus and @xmath19 data when the energy is rescaled by a factor of @xmath24 .",
    "this universality of the multiplicites indicates that the bulk of the produced particles depends only on the total energy ( and @xmath25 ) and not the species of the colliding particles .    , @xmath18 , @xmath17 and @xmath26 collisions .",
    "figure by phobos collaboration from @xcite.,width=321 ]    the measured multiplicity at mid-(pseudo)rapidity in nucleus - nucleus collisions increases slower with energy , as @xmath27 .",
    "this simple linear in @xmath27 extrapolation to the lhc energies predicts that @xmath28 .",
    "various theoretical predictions for lhc energy are larger than this simple estimate and span a wide range , up to nearly @xmath29 for the value at midrapidity .",
    "this is probably connected to the fact that in most of these calculations some semi - perturbative component is present which results in a power - like increase of the multiplicity rather than the logarithm .",
    "this large uncertainty of the phenomenological extrapolations reflects our rather limited theoretical understanding of the energy dependence of multiplicities .",
    "phobos collaboration performed measurements of the rapidity distributions for various energies ( and systems ) and found that the distributions exhibit limiting fragmentation property which is also called extended longitudinal scaling @xcite .",
    "this means that when viewed in the rest frame of one of the projectiles the ( pseudo)rapidity distribution becomes a function of only @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the rapidity of the beam . therefore the rapidity distribution in the regime around @xmath32 is dominated by the fragments of the broken target whereas the fragments of the projectile move with increasing velocity as the energy is further increased ( to study these fragments one has to go to the rest frame of the projectile @xmath33 ) .",
    "the limiting fragmentation also requires that the interaction between the target and the projectile does not depend appreciably on the energy .",
    "this scaling means that the rapidity distributions must be determined very early in the collision , most probably by the initial state .     for various center - of - mass energies .",
    "curves are from calculation using the cgc nonlinear equations @xcite.,width=283 ]    fig .",
    "[ rap_distr ] illustrates this phenomenon .",
    "the curves shown in figure are obtained from the calculation @xcite based on the @xmath34-factorization approach together with the evolution via nonlinear equation for the gluon density . in this approach",
    "the rapidity distribution is evaluated as the convolution of two parton densities corresponding to the target and the projectile respectively . in the fragmentation region ,",
    "the target parton density is evaluated at rather large values of bjorken @xmath35 whereas the projectile density at rather small values of @xmath35 .",
    "the essential part of this calculation , which enables to reproduce the observed scaling , is the fact that the rapidity distribution in the target fragmentation region is dominated by the initial state parton density of the target , probed at large values of the bjorken variable @xmath35 . at these values",
    "the parton density possesses bjorken scaling , i.e .",
    "does not depend on the scale at which it is evaluated .",
    "the projectile density , which depends on rather small values of @xmath35 and small scales , is saturated since it is evaluated from the evolution equation which takes into account nonlinearities important at high parton densities .",
    "therefore this density does not depend much on the @xmath35 values and hence the center of mass energy .",
    "we see that even though the approach is semi - perturbative it does capture the essential physics features necessary to reproduce the limiting fragmentation phenomenon .",
    "to explore the properties of the quark - gluon plasma created in the high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions experiments at rhic measured the suppression of the production of the high @xmath16 particles and heavy quarks .",
    "these are excellent probes of the produced medium , and due to the large difference in scales ( high @xmath16 as compared to the bulk of low @xmath16 particles ) , it should be in principle possible to employ the perturbative methods .",
    "one usually quantifies the effect of the medium by evaluating the ratio @xmath36 . as seen from fig .",
    "[ pt_had_raa ] from @xcite the @xmath37 ratio is significantly below @xmath38 even at the very high values of @xmath16 .",
    "this phenomenon is called the jet quenching which is interpreted as the interaction of the produced jet ( or rather leading high @xmath16 particle ) with the produced medium .",
    "the interaction results in the significant energy loss of the leading high @xmath16 particle .",
    "in fact the effect is so large that it indicates that the high @xmath16 particles which reach the detectors are emitted from a relatively thin outer shell of the high density region .     for the produced hadrons as a function of their transverse momentum .",
    "figure from @xcite.,width=283 ]    to describe the jet quenching one usually starts from the standard collinear factorization formula for the exclusive hadron production in the vacuum @xmath39 where @xmath40 are parton distribution functions evaluated at scale @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the partonic cross section and @xmath43 is the fragmentation function from parton @xmath44 to hadron @xmath45 . to evaluate the production in the medium one",
    "convolutes the above expression with the so called quenching weight @xcite @xmath46 which depends on the length of the medium and the parameter @xmath47 which acts as a transport coefficient for the medium .",
    "one has to emphasize that although in the proton - proton collisions the factorization formula ( [ eq : coll_vac ] ) is well established , ( up to higher twist corrections ) it is not proven to hold in form ( [ eq : coll_med ] ) for collisions which involve large nuclei .",
    "final state interactions could in principle affect the partonic cross section @xmath42 in a non - factorizable way .",
    "it is therefore an assumption , that after the partons have been produced in the hard scattering process , one can further factorize their interactions into one universal function @xmath48 .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "[ pt_had_raa ] are from * ? ? ?",
    "* which is calculation based on the theoretical framework described above .",
    "the quenching parameter @xmath47 was fitted to get the best description of the data .",
    "the production of the heavy quarks is another excellent process . in principle",
    "the calculation framework is the same as above .",
    "one does expect some differences due to the fact that in the vacuum the radiation patter for heavy quarks is different from the light quarks .",
    "due to the their mass heavy quarks should radiate less than the light quarks at angles smaller than @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the mass of the heavy quark and @xmath51 is its energy .",
    "this is called the dead cone effect @xcite .",
    "therefore the net effect would be less supression ( larger @xmath37 ) than for the light quarks . the measured suppression for the heavy quarks is of the same order as for the light quarks , and the theoretical predictions ( for example @xcite ) do not quite predict such a large value .",
    "one has to emphasize that the heavy quark production in @xmath22 ( from electrons emerging from semi - leptonic decays ) is underestimated by the nlo perturbative qcd calculation by a factor of about @xmath52 for phenix data and by about factor @xmath53 for the star data .",
    "therefore the process with the heavy quarks calls for better understanding , possible taking into account various effects : collisional energy loss , bottom / charm ratio or factorization breaking .",
    "we conclude our discussion of the hard probes with the description of the new calculational methods which employ the ads / cft correspondence to evaluate the jet quenching parameter . in this approach @xcite , the expectation value of the wilson loop , as an average over the medium",
    "is evaluated using the string / gauge duality in the limit of the strong coupling constant .",
    "this expectation value is obtained as an exponential of the string action evaluated at the minimum @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the nambu - goto action with the metric on the @xmath56 dimensional ads space . in the case of the finite temperature ,",
    "the corresponding metric is that of the ads schwarzschild black hole . in the strong coupling and the multicolor",
    "limit the problem becomes classical , i.e. reduces to finding the extremum of the action .",
    "it is possible , using this method , to evaluate the value of the jet quenching parameter which in this case is @xmath57 .",
    "we note however , that all these results can be derived only for the case of the n=4 sym theory .",
    "the processes described above clearly indicate the presence of the dense medium in the final state .",
    "the natural question arises whether one can also observe the effects coming from the initial state , namely the wave function of the colliding nuclei .",
    "brahms collaboration performed a measurement of the high @xmath16 suppression as a function of rapidity for @xmath26 collisions @xcite . whereas at midrapidity no suppression is observed for this process",
    ", the @xmath58 clearly shows a decreasing trend when moving into forward rapidity .",
    "this phenomenon was quite successfully described by the models which involve saturation effects in the gluon density or in general by the color glass condensate model @xcite . in cgc",
    "the basic object is the wave function of the nucleus .",
    "obviously the complete knowledge of such wave function requires methods which go beyond that known in preturbation theory .",
    "one can nevertheless calculate the variation of this wave function with energy .",
    "this is governed by the renormalization group equation which can be derived from the feynman graphs in the leading logarithmic approximation . at very small values of bjorken @xmath35 one",
    "expects the fast growth of the gluon density within the nucleus .",
    "cgc model together with the renormalization group equations predicts that this growth should be tamed whenever the @xmath35 becomes sufficiently small .",
    "the transition between the fast growth and the regime where the recombination effects for the gluons become important is governed by the saturation scale @xmath59 which is a function of the bjorken @xmath35 .",
    "thus the saturation scale provides with a dynamical cutoff at low values of @xmath35 and at low scales .",
    "it is the prediction of the cgc model that the @xmath58 ratio should decrease at forward rapidities @xcite .",
    "cgc model has been successfully used to describe various observables in heavy ion collisions : multiplicites , rapidity distributions ( mentioned already in the previous section ) @xcite and also @xmath58 ratio .",
    "one has to emphasize though that there are several questions concerning strict applicability of this approach to the rhic data .",
    "the values of @xmath35 are not very small for the rhic kinematics , the formalism correctly incorporates only gluons and it has been so far only used at leading order whereas higher orders are known to be very large .",
    "nevertheless , the cgc approach , mostly due to its interesting properties in the infrared regime , remains a very attractive approach both theoretically and phenomenologically and its predictions should be further confronted with the experimental data .",
    "we have discussed a selection of the phenomena measured at the relativistic heavy ion collider .",
    "clearly , due to our space and time limitations the list presented here is by no means exhaustive .",
    "the bulk properties as shown in the measurements of the multiplicities are very similar to that measured in the simpler systems : proton - proton or even in @xmath19 collisions .",
    "the extended longitudinal scaling of rapidity distributions indicate the importance of the initial state . hard probes in form of the high @xmath16 particles or heavy quarks signify the presence of the strongly interacting medium .",
    "this is further corroborated by the observation of the strong elliptic flow in peripheral collisions .",
    "the theoretical descriptions based on hydrodynamics have been quite successful in describing the hadron spectra and the anisotropy .",
    "also calculations which employ the perturbative methods supplemented by the rescattering or recombination(saturation ) effects are able to describe the bulk of the data at large values of the transverse momenta .",
    "nevertheless , despite these incontrovertible successes in phenomenology , the rhic data still constitute a significant challenge for a theory and call for a more complete and coherent description within qcd .",
