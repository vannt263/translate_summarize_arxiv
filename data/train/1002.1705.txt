    "an intense interest in populating the smbh database was sparked by observed correlations between @xmath0  and fundamental properties of their host bulges .",

    "it is important to only use these galaxies as there are no @xmath1=400 km  s@xmath14galaxies at 1  mpc , for example .",
    "second , random @xmath0  estimates are applied to each galaxy , i.e. , no galaxy is assumed to intrinsically fall on the @xmath4  relation .",
    "this ensures no pre - selection of galaxies that lie on the @xmath4  relation . throughout",
    ", a distinction is made between the _ observed _",
    "@xmath4  relation ( published values ) and the _ observable _",
    "@xmath4  relation ( the relation that can be fitted using the data simulated here ) .",
    "in short , these simulations take a galaxy with a known @xmath1  and distance , assign a @xmath0 , then calculate @xmath3 . the @xmath3 argument",
    "is then applied ; if @xmath3 is unresolved the galaxy is removed from the sample ( the low mass cut ) .",
    "if the assigned @xmath0  generates a galaxy that lies above the _ observed _ @xmath4  relation , it is also removed from the sample ( the high mass cut ) .",
    "the _ observable _",
    "@xmath4  relation is then fit to the remaining galaxies using a levenberg - marquardt least - squares add - on to idl .    an sql search of the hyperleda catalog was performed .",
    "all galaxies with a kinematical distance modulus less than 35.0 ( 100  mpc ) were found . of",
    "the 49740 galaxies returned , 2518 have published values of @xmath1 .",
    "the incompleteness of this sample , due to difficulties in measuring @xmath1  in faint galaxies , is noted .",
    "values of @xmath3 ( in arcsecs ) were then calculated for each galaxy by assigning a @xmath0 .    in the first cases ,",
    "the low mass cut was made by applying @xmath12 to represent the _ hst _ psf .",
    "however , several values of @xmath15 are applied later .",
    "the high mass cuts were then made by considering the _ observed _ distribution of galaxies in the @xmath4  plane ; there is a clear absence of over - massive smbhs , i.e. , there are no @xmath1=50 km  s@xmath14  dwarf spheroids in the local group with @xmath0@xmath16",
    ". such a nearby over - massive smbh population would have been detected , and therefore it is assumed that these objects do not exist .",
    "galaxies selected for the high mass cuts were determined by assigning a scatter ( @xmath17  dex ) and upper limits to the @xmath4  relation , @xmath18 .",
    "galaxies with @xmath19 were removed from the sample , where @xmath20m_\\odot$ ] .",
    "each galaxy was first assigned 90 separate values of @xmath0  using a step size of @xmath21 from @xmath22 to @xmath23 . in this case , the high mass cut was made by applying the @xmath24 relation of g09 and the @xmath25 relation of ff05 .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows the distribution of _ observable _ galaxies in the @xmath4  plane assuming every galaxy within 100  mpc can host any @xmath0 and that @xmath12 .",
    "the fit to this sample ( red line ) is @xmath26 .",
    "however , galaxies host single ( or binary ) smbhs , therefore it is shrewd to assign each galaxy a single ( uniformly sampled ) random value for @xmath0  in the range @xmath27 .",
    "the distribution of _ observable _ galaxies in the @xmath4  plane using a random sample of @xmath0  is shown in figure  [ fig:3 ] using the red open circles . in this case , the low cut was made using @xmath12 , and the high mass cut was made using a @xmath18  relation of @xmath28 ( g09 ) .",
    "the @xmath4  relation fit to these _ observable _ galaxies ( red line ) is @xmath29  dex .",
    "an _ observable _",
    "@xmath4  relation of @xmath30  dex is found using the high mass @xmath18  relation of ff05 .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] also shows all _ observed _ galaxies based on the combined catalogs of @xcite , @xcite and g09 .",
    "no distinction is made between `` good '' and `` bad '' @xmath0  estimates , or differences in quoted @xmath1 ; all estimates are plotted ( 143 total ) .",

    "however , as this result derives from a single random sampling of @xmath0 , it represents a single possible _ observable _",
    "@xmath4  relation .",
    "if galaxies intrinsically have random @xmath0  values , then the range of _ observable _ smbhs could have a distribution given by figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "therefore , 50 separate random @xmath0  samplings were then made for each galaxy , and in each case a fit to the _ observable _",
    "@xmath4  relation was performed .",
    "in addition , as the previously used value of @xmath12 only applies to _ hst _ observations , the analysis was repeated for a range of @xmath3 lower cut offs .",
    "finally , as the high mass cuts may not actually be defined by the g09 and ff05 fits , values of @xmath47 from 7.8 to 8.7 ( in 0.1 steps ) and @xmath48 from 3.6 to 5.4 ( in 0.2 steps ) were used to create an addition 100 individual @xmath18  cutoffs .",
    "the mean values of @xmath49 and @xmath11 , derived by applying these different @xmath15 criteria , and from using these variable upper limits , are presented in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "table  [ tab:1 ] has several notable features .",
    "first , as @xmath15 rises @xmath11 falls .",
    "this is expected because the range of _ observable _ smbhs decreases with larger values of @xmath15 .",
    "second , the slope ( @xmath50 ) remains consistent .",
    "finally , in the case of the variable upper limits , the zero - point ( @xmath51 ) remains constant and is consistent with the mid - value of the @xmath18  limits imposed on the sample . to test whether these values of @xmath51 are a consequence of the high mass cut conditions , the analysis was repeated using @xmath47 limits of 7.0 and 8.8 ( in 0.2 steps ) . applying a @xmath12 low mass cut , an _",
    "observable _ relation with @xmath52 was found .",
    "again , the values of @xmath51 are consistent with the mid - value of the imposed limits .",
    "however , an estimate of the _ observed _",
    "@xmath18  relation can be made . the _ observed _ smbh sample in figure  [ fig:3",
    "] was used to define an upper limit by fitting all _ observed _ smbhs that fall above the ff05 and g09 relations , and above @xmath17 .",
    "the fit to these over - massive smbhs produce an upper limit of @xmath53 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "this @xmath18  fit was then applied to 50 random values of @xmath0  in each galaxy , and the _ observable _",
    "@xmath4  relations were then fitted in each case .",
    "the average of these fits are also presented in table  [ tab:1 ] . in this case , the fitted values of @xmath51 and @xmath50 are consistent with the variable upper limits , but the values of @xmath11 are significantly larger .",
    "this is expected , as these fits were applied to data that had the maximum range in the @xmath4  plane due to the high _ observed _ values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "in summary , as a result of applying the @xmath3 argument , a @xmath4  relation consistent with _ observed _ values ( @xmath54  dex ) can be fitted to a sample of galaxies that contain random mass smbhs , and as a consequence do not follow a @xmath4  relation .",
    "the @xmath3 argument removes low mass smbhs where @xmath3 would not be resolved , and high mass smbhs where @xmath3 should have been resolved if such a population were present . therefore , for scaling relations to be of value in constraining galaxy evolution models , @xmath0  estimates must not be solely proposed on the basis of critically resolving values of @xmath3 derived from @xmath1 .",
    "it is unlikely that an intrinsic @xmath4  relation has been _ observed _ as a result of critically sampling @xmath3 in the @xmath4  plane , and it will be some time until we are able to sample a significant area rightward of the _ observed _ @xmath4  relation ( e.g. , ff05 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore , it is clear that caution must be used in the application of the _ observed _",
    "@xmath4  relation until this issue can be resolved .",
    "the possibility of there being no tight intrinsic @xmath4  relation , and that the distribution of _ observed _ galaxies in the @xmath4  plane determine an upper limit only , is now discussed . as the same @xmath0  estimates are used to define the other @xmath0  scaling relations",
    ", this also implies that all _ observed _ scaling relations are upper limits .",
    "there are a number of questions arising from this possibility , beginning with the most fundamental .",
    "why do _ observed _ smbhs fall on the @xmath4  relation ?",
    "there are several smbhs with such high quality @xmath0  estimates ( sgr a * , ngc  4258 , m87 ) , that there clearly is a relation between @xmath0  and @xmath1  in some galaxies .",
    "however , the @xmath4  plane has been increasingly populated with less certain @xmath0  estimates that have potentially been included on the assumption that @xmath3 is spatially resolved , i.e. , that they follow a previously estimated @xmath4  relation defined by higher quality @xmath0  estimates . in these cases , as the simulations presented here show , an _ observed _",
    "relation will arise simply as a result of the @xmath3 selection effect , even if @xmath0  is randomly distributed within galaxies .",
    "does a population of under - massive smbhs exist , and have they been detected ? if the @xmath4  relation is an upper limit , then there should be galaxies that host low mass smbhs , as suggested by simulations @xcite .",
    "indeed , both the simulations presented here , and the observations plotted in figure  [ fig:3 ] , show that under - massive smbhs can be , and have been , detected .",
    "some notable cases are that of ngc  4435 @xcite , a sample of barred galaxies @xcite and narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies @xcite .",
    "in fact , the evidence to suggest the presence of under - massive smbhs is not matched by any evidence for a significant population of over - massive smbhs leftward of the _ observed _",
    "@xmath4  relation .",
    "it is important to note some intricacies with the two dominant techniques for measuring @xmath0  ( stellar and gas dynamics ) . in the case of stellar dynamics , there are systematics to the models that may allow a large range of @xmath0  in a given bulge @xcite . in the case of gas dynamics , it is unclear what the inclination of the nuclear gas disk may be ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "both methods allow the potential for many of the current @xmath0  estimates to in fact be upper limits , i.e. , the true @xmath4  plane may have a large distribution of under - massive smbhs .",
    "therefore , under - massive smbhs may have been observed , their mass over - estimated , and their impact over - looked .",
    "all smbh models allow stringent upper limits to be placed on @xmath0  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , these @xmath0  upper limits will also be dependent on the available spatial resolution .",
    "any kinematical data will have two velocity points spatially separated on a scale of @xmath15 .",
    "an upper limit to @xmath0  is estimated by including an increasing dark mass until the derived model becomes inconsistent with the data , i.e. , a higher upper limit to @xmath0will be estimated using a lower @xmath15 .",
    "there are still important constraints that can be added to the @xmath4  plane from estimates of @xmath0  upper limits , however , as upper limits that fall below the _ observed _",
    "@xmath4  relation provide the same evidence for under - massive smbhs as would a tightly constrained low mass @xmath0 . at present , most @xmath0  upper limits are based on data derived from gas dynamics .",
    "consequently , these limits generally fall above the _ observed _",
    "@xmath4  relation due to unknown amounts of line broadening from non - gravitational processes , and uncertainties in the inclination if the nuclear gas disk .",
    "if the @xmath4  relation represents an upper limit in the @xmath4  plane , then what is this limit ? in   [ mands ]",
    "an upper limit of @xmath53 was found based on the distribution of _ observed _ smbhs leftward of the _ observed _",
    "@xmath4  relation .",
    "this is likely a good approximation to the @xmath18  limit as there are no reports of a steeper relation .",
    "however , this estimate does not include the potential over - massive smbhs from the upper limits calculated by @xcite . including these limits to the upper limit sample",
    "gives values of @xmath55 to @xmath18 .",
    "as expected , due to the addition of smbh limits at lower @xmath0 , this @xmath18  limit is more shallow with a higher zero - point . including these limits at the lower @xmath0  end of the @xmath4   plane addresses , in part , a limitation of the sample used here .",
    "as already noted , the @xmath1  catalog used here is likely incomplete due to the difficulty of measuring @xmath1  in faint galaxies at greater distances .",
    "in addition , the @xmath1  catalog likely contains inhomogenuous measurements that may not translate from bulge to bulge .",
    "what are the consequences to galaxy evolution models if there is only a @xmath18  relation ?",
    "first , galaxies will no longer be required to obey the @xmath4  relation , and could host a smbh with any @xmath0  below @xmath18 .",
    "models that include feedback from the smbh to the galaxy will then need to be carefully reconsidered . while the smbh will undoubtedly have some influence on a portion of the host galaxy",
    ", it would not need to affect large scale properties ; evolution of the smbh would be a result of host galaxy evolution .",
    "an upper limit in the @xmath4  plane would also represent the pinnacle of smbh evolution as a function of @xmath1 , in which galaxies evolve up to the @xmath18  limit .",
    "a signature of such a scenario could be a cosmic variation in @xmath11 ( the scatter would increase with redshift ) and an _ observed _ @xmath4  relation that does not exceed @xmath18 .",
    "if the distribution of @xmath0  is random within bulges , then when compared with the local _ observed _ @xmath4   relation , @xmath0  estimates from higher redshift could fall to the left or the right .",
    "@xcite find a population of z=0.36 seyfert 1 galaxies that lie above the local _ observed _",
    "@xmath4  relation by @xmath56@xmath0@xmath57 , but this population still lies below the @xmath18  limit estimated here . finally , if smbhs can reside anywhere below the @xmath18  limit , then the local black hole mass function may have been over - estimated .",
    "this would relax the observation that merging is not important and that smbh growth is dominated by accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this potentially allows anti - hierarchical smbh growth to no longer present problems for hierarchical galaxy formation models .    the use of the hyperleda database ( http://leda.univ-lyon1.fr ) is acknowledged .",
