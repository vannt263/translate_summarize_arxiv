    "the analytic treatment of quenched disordered systems in condensed matter physics invokes many concepts from statistical theory . among these , we shall be concerned in this paper with the connection between the probability distribution of lyapunov characteristic exponents for the ( equilibrium ) problem of low - lying magnetic excitations in spin glasses , and the fokker - planck ( f - p ) equation  @xcite , which is a key element in the description of non - equilibrium stochastic processes .",
    "links between an f - p equation and stationary distributions of physical quantities in a transfer - matrix ( tm ) description have been established , usually in the context of calculating the probability distribution functions ( pdf ) of electronic conductance , in one - dimensional ( 1d ) or quasi-1d noninteracting electronic systems with disorder ( anderson localization )  @xcite . specifically , one considers the distribution of the tm itself ( or , equivalently , its transmission eigenvalues ) , between the left and right extremes of a wire of length @xmath0 lattice spacings .",
    "the f - p equation is set up to account for the infinitesimal changes in the tm , caused by a small length variation @xmath1 .",
    "the quantities whose pdf is calculated are , therefore , aggregate in the sense that they explicitly incorporate all contributions for the tm , say , from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , i.e. , they represent _ global _ lyapunov exponents .",
    "this is in contrast with the approach we take here ; as shown below , we shall concentrate on the pdf of _ local _ lyapunov exponents , which appear not to have been as thoroughly exploited as their global counterparts ( at least in the condensed - matter context of localization and similar problems ) .    as a model system to apply the ideas developed here , we consider spin waves ( magnons ) in a simplified spin glass model , the so - called heisenberg - mattis spin glass ( hmsg )  @xcite . in 1d ,",
    "the dynamics of hmsgs turns out to exhibit many non - trivial features  @xcite , including dynamic exponents  @xcite different from the standard hydrodynamic predictions  @xcite .    in 1d , all eigenstates are localized for any amount of disorder , though as energy @xmath4 , the localization length @xmath5 diverges continuously .",
    "this , in turn , suggests the applicability of scaling concepts in the low - frequency , long - wavelength limit .",
    "operationally , one can obtain @xmath5 in one - dimensional systems by using a tm approach , and extracting the smallest lyapunov exponent ( whose inverse corresponds to the largest localization length ) which arises from repeated iteration of the tm .",
    "this has been done for hmsg chains  @xcite , and can be extended to hmsg in @xmath6 and @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "lyapunov exponents are well defined quantities in the sense that , for @xmath8 iterations of the tm , the width of the distribution of their corresponding estimates shrinks to zero  @xcite ( as @xmath9 in many cases of interest , as a consequence of the central limit theorem ) .",
    "however , it has been shown  @xcite that the so - called _ local _ lyapunov exponents ( lle , to be defined more accurately below ) exhibit non - trivial distributions whose width remains finite even as @xmath10 becomes fairly large ( compared , e.g. , with the localization length ) .",
    "furthermore , lles may provide a wealth of information specific to the dynamics of the associated physical system , which does not manifest itself in the aggregated , @xmath11-function like behavior of their global counterparts .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the statistical properties of local lyapunov exponents in the 1d hmsg at zero temperature , by means of a connection to a suitable version of the f - p equation .",
    "in section  [ sec:2 ] we recall pertinent aspects of the hmsg , specializing to 1d . in section  [ sec:3 ] , we first consider the aggregate effects which characterize the ( global ) lyapunov exponents for the system under study ; then we investigate local exponents ( lle ) , in particular the case of _ instantaneous _ lle .",
    "we establish a connection between the tm - iterated recursion relation for the problem , and a suitable f - p equation governing the evolution of the probability distribution of the instantaneous lle .",
    "we show that the closed - form ( stationary ) solutions to the f - p equation are in excellent accord with numerical simulations , for both the unmagnetized and magnetized versions of the 1d hmsg .",
    "scaling properties for non - stationary conditions are derived from the f - p equation in a special limit ( in which diffusive effects tend to vanish ) , and also shown to provide a close description to the corresponding numerical - simulation data .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conc ] , concluding remarks are made .",
    "we consider heisenberg spins on sites of a hypercubic lattice , with nearest - neighbor couplings : @xmath12 the bonds are randomly taken from a quenched , binary probability distribution , @xmath13 here we shall mainly consider @xmath14 ( unmagnetized spin glass ) .    the mattis model ascribes disorder to sites rather than bonds ( @xmath15 ) , so that the hamiltonian reads : @xmath16 where @xmath17 with probability @xmath18 , ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "then @xmath14 is the mattis spin glass while @xmath20 corresponds to a magnetized mattis model .",
    "this way , the overall energy is minimized by making @xmath21 , which constitutes a ( classical ) ground state of the hamiltonian eq .  ( [ eq:3 ] ) .",
    "consideration of the spin - wave equations of motion ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) gives , with @xmath22 : @xmath23 where the @xmath24 are mattis - transformed local ( on - site ) spin - wave amplitudes , and the sum is over sites @xmath25 which are nearest neighbors of @xmath26 .",
    "for the eigenmodes with frequency @xmath27 ( in units of the exchange constant @xmath28 ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) leads to @xmath29 the relationship of frequency to wave number , @xmath30 ( in the context of localization , this corresponds to @xmath31 ) , at low energies is characterized by the dynamic exponent @xmath32 : @xmath33 for @xmath34 in 1d , it was predicted analytically  @xcite , and verified by numerical calculations  @xcite , that @xmath35 .",
    "still in 1d , but at general @xmath18 , eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) becomes @xmath36 a tm approach@xcite can be formulated , giving  @xcite : @xmath37 the procedure for calculating lyapunov exponents in this case is the same as that used for anderson localization problems  @xcite . indeed , in both cases",
    "the tm is symplectic , and one can use oseledec s theorem and dynamic filtration  @xcite to extract the smallest lyapunov exponent , whose inverse is the largest localization length .",
    "the lyapunov exponent emerging from iteration of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1dtm ] ) is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an arbitrary initial vector of unit modulus .",
    "the lle , @xmath41 , is defined  @xcite as the finite-@xmath10 version of eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.1 ] ) . for the sake of completeness , before going further we exhibit the evolution of the statistics of @xmath41 ( hereafter referred to as @xmath42 for short ) against increasing @xmath10 .",
    "we consider the tm given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1dtm ] ) , with @xmath14 and @xmath43 ( fixed ) , for which case existing numerical results  @xcite give @xmath44 lattice spacings , i.e. , @xmath45 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lleb ] , one sees that the probability distribution function ( pdf ) , @xmath46 , of @xmath42 takes on an approximately gaussian shape only for @xmath47  .",
    "[ fig : llen ] ( a ) provides a quantitative check on the increasing narrowness of the pdf for @xmath48 , and on the convergence process @xmath49 .",
    "one can infer the accuracy of the single - sample estimate corresponding to @xmath50 ( denoted by an arrow pointing to the vertical axis in fig .",
    "[ fig : llen ] ( a ) ) , by extrapolating the @xmath10-dependence of the width @xmath51 of the pdf against @xmath52 ( shown in the main diagram ) .",
    "the result is @xmath53 , hence the associated error bar would be invisible on the scale of the figure .",
    "the simplest quantitative indicator of whether the pdf actually turns gaussian with increasing @xmath10 [ in the process of becoming a @xmath54 function , characteristic of the self - averaging property just demonstrated ] is its skewness  @xcite , @xmath55 .",
    "one must bear in mind that , because the number of samples @xmath56 is finite ( incomplete sampling ) , @xmath57 itself will have a distribution . while this is true also for @xmath58 and @xmath51 , the effects on @xmath57 are much more prominent since it is the ratio of two quantities which , in the present case , both vanish as @xmath59 .",
    "indeed , we have checked that , for the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : llen ] ( a ) , corresponding to @xmath60 , estimates of @xmath58 and @xmath51 from distinct sequences of pseudo - random numbers usually differ only by a few parts in @xmath61 . on the other hand , it is known  @xcite that , for an incompletely sampled gaussian distribution , the width of its own skewness distribution is approximately @xmath62 ( @xmath63 here ) . since our own large-@xmath10 pdfs",
    "are , to zeroth - order , gaussian , we shall use this value as a lower bound to the uncertainty of our estimates for @xmath57 .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : llen ] ( b ) . given the trend exhibited by the calculated @xmath57 for the three largest values of @xmath10 used ( especially in contrast with the smaller-@xmath10 region ) ,",
    "it appears safe to conclude that the skewness is in fact approaching zero , within the pertinent error bars .",
    "thus , the overall evidence is compatible with a limiting gaussian form for the pdf of the lles as @xmath64 .",
    "we now turn to the opposite limit , which is our main concern here . instead of considering the aggregate effect of contributions to @xmath42 , we shall analyse the pdfs of such contributions separately .    the case @xmath65 of eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.1 ] ) is often denoted as `` instantaneous '' lle  @xcite . here",
    ", we shall use the term in the following way .",
    "the _ instantaneous lle at _",
    "@xmath66 , to be denoted by @xmath67 , is the local contribution to the lle , given at @xmath66 , of the multiplying process denoted in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.1 ] ) .",
    "one then has : @xmath68 for a one - dimensional mapping , the instantaneous lle , as defined above , would be simply the local stretch factor  @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "where even in 1d the tm is @xmath69 , it is known that the eigenvectors ( lyapunov basis ) of a product of random matrices are only _ local _ properties , as opposed to the corresponding eigenvalues ( i.e. , the lyapunov spectrum ) which are global ones  @xcite .",
    "thus , one has a rotation of the local lyapunov basis as the tm is repeatedly iterated .",
    "as the tm is symplectic , in 1d this means that the ( two ) local eigenvalues are inverse of each other , so @xmath67 can be extracted by suitable analysis of the growth factor associated to a given member of the lyapunov basis .",
    "the connection with the f - p equation proceeds as follows .",
    "one gets , by taking the continuum limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1d ] ) : @xmath70 where @xmath71 stands for position along the axis .",
    "one sees that @xmath72 is the result of accumulated contributions from the instantaneous lyapunov exponent @xmath73 , @xmath74 : @xmath75 therefore , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cont1 ] ) turns into : @xmath76 eq .",
    "( [ eq : cont1 ] ) then yields the following equation for the stochastic variable @xmath77 : @xmath78 in the general case @xmath79 is a binary - distributed variable with mean @xmath80 and variance @xmath81 .",
    "the f - p equation corresponding to the evolution of the probability distribution of @xmath82 is , with @xmath71 naturally assuming the role of time - like variable  @xcite : @xmath83      in this subsection we take the special case of an unmagnetized hmsg ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "( [ eq : fp - mag ] ) then becomes : @xmath84 assuming stationarity , @xmath85 ( which corresponds to the regime @xmath86 ) , the equation to solve is : @xmath87 thus , one gets : @xmath88 it is immediate to see that the @xmath89 power , referred to in connection with eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) , arises in the scaling variable .",
    "furthermore , it is clear from the derivation of the present results that they apply only in the scaling regime , i.e. , @xmath4 , small @xmath90 , @xmath91 .    with @xmath92 , the normalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp3 ] ) implies @xmath93    the numerical verification of the ideas just presented begins by checking the behavior of the pdfs for @xmath94 , against varying @xmath10 .",
    "selected data are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : inst ] .",
    "one can see that , for the ranges of @xmath10 considered in the figure , the overall shape of the pdfs remains roughly constant , though a slight narrowing and shifting of the central peak take place as @xmath10 increases .",
    "this is in contrast with the lles exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : lleb ] , for which variation of @xmath10 in the same range was accompanied by a pronounced change in shape and width of the respective pdfs . for @xmath95",
    "[ not shown in the figure ] , the pdf for @xmath94 starts nearly flat at @xmath65 , and gradually develops both the central peak , and the small `` wings '' at the ends ( whose relevance in fig .",
    "[ fig : inst ] is overemphasized by the logarithmic scale on the vertical axis ) .",
    "the very good superposition of the @xmath96 and @xmath97 data in the figure indicates the predicted trend towards a fixed , @xmath10-independent form , which corresponds to stationarity of the f - p equation [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp2 ] ) ] .",
    "this has been confirmed by examination of numerical pdfs for @xmath98 .",
    "recalling that the localization length for @xmath43 , as is the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : inst ] , is @xmath44 lattice spacings , we see that the condition for an @xmath10-independent pdf is indeed @xmath47 .",
    "we now test whether the form given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp3 ] ) describes our numerical data .",
    "figure  [ fig : exfit ] shows that the agreement is excellent , in the region @xmath99 , which is where scaling is expected to hold .",
    "note that there are no adjustable parameters in the fit , all scale factors being provided by normalization and scaling considerations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : scale ] we test for consistency of scaling among numerical data for different energies  @xmath27 , as suggested by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp3 ] ) .",
    "again , the agreement with predictions is excellent , provided that the conditions upon which eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp3 ] ) was derived are obeyed .      for the magnetized case @xmath20",
    "we return to the general form of the f - p equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp - mag ] ) , whose stationary solution is given by : @xmath101 where @xmath102 in analogy with sec .",
    "[ sec:3c ] , we first check whether eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp - mag2 ] ) gives a faithful description of simulational data , for given @xmath18 and @xmath27 .    in figure  [ fig",
    ": exfitp8 ] , calculated data for @xmath103 , @xmath43 are shown , together with the analytical result from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp - mag2 ] ) for the same values of @xmath18 and @xmath27 .",
    "apart from an overall normalization factor which affects only the vertical scale , there are no adjustable parameters .",
    "again , the agreement is very good .    in order to emphasize the degree to which the shape and range of the pdfs are affected by variations in the physical parameters ,",
    "figure  [ fig : exfitp8 ] also shows the pdf for the unmagnetized case , at the same energy @xmath43 .",
    "as @xmath18 increases from @xmath104 , the general trend is towards reduction of the skewness ( which is @xmath105 at @xmath14 , @xmath106 at @xmath107 , and [ in absolute value ] @xmath108 at @xmath109 ) .",
    "the peak of the distribution , which is about one standard deviation away from the origin at @xmath14 , approaches @xmath110 as @xmath18 approaches unity .",
    "this process is accompanied by a broadening of the pdf .",
    "we now proceed to framing the preceding observations within a crossover description .",
    "one sees that , because @xmath111 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp - mag3 ] ) is a polynomial in @xmath112 , for @xmath20 it is not possible to develop scaling arguments ( over the whole range of the variable @xmath82 ) similar to those invoked for @xmath14 , and graphically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : scale ] .",
    "nevertheless , analysis of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp - mag3 ] ) shows that the crossover away from unbiased ( @xmath14 ) behavior is governed by the dimensionless ratio @xmath113 ( @xmath114^{1/2}$ ] away from @xmath115 ) .",
    "this way , @xmath82 scales with @xmath116 for @xmath117 , and with @xmath118 for @xmath119 .",
    "analysis of the asymptotic behavior of @xmath120 , as given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fp - mag2 ] ) and  ( [ eq : fp - mag3 ] ) , shows that , with @xmath32 defined as above and @xmath121 , one has for the tails of the distribution : @xmath122 where @xmath123 , and ( for @xmath119 ) the normalization constant @xmath124 .",
    "numerical checks of eq .",
    "( [ eq : asymp1 ] ) against simulational data must be carried out for suitable ranges of @xmath18 , @xmath27 , @xmath82 ( equivalently , @xmath32 , @xmath125 ) , such that ( i ) asymptotic behavior has already set in ( i.e. large @xmath90 , @xmath126 ) , and ( ii ) one is still within the scaling regime ( which implies small @xmath90 ) .",
    "thus one expects eq .",
    "( [ eq : asymp1 ] ) to hold only within windows of varying width , which may or may not be easy to identify against statistical noise .    in figure",
    "[ fig : asymp ] we show that it is indeed possible to find intervals of @xmath125 along which a plot of @xmath127 is rather flat , as suggested by eq .",
    "( [ eq : asymp1 ] ) .",
    "while the evidence is somewhat smeared for the upper set of data ( corresponding to @xmath109 , @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath128 ) , it is clear for the lower one ( for which @xmath107 , @xmath129 , i.e. @xmath130 ) .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of the averages of @xmath127 ( each denoted by a horizontal line in the figure ) along the respective flat sections [ these latter defined with an inevitable degree of arbitrariness ] is @xmath131 .",
    "this compares reasonably well with the predicted value @xmath132 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : asymp1 ] ) and the comments immediately below it .",
    "given that the latter result is expected to hold for @xmath119 , one may infer that the small discrepancy found is due to @xmath133 , @xmath134 not being large enough .",
    "finally we remark that the pure - ferromagnet limit is somewhat subtle , because in order to reach the stationary regime of the f - p equation where the @xmath10-independent pdf forms hold , the condition @xmath47 must be obeyed . however , as @xmath115 , and for the low energies where scaling is valid , @xmath135 diverges as one approaches the pure - system magnon band ( located at @xmath136 , in the current units ) .",
    "for example , at @xmath109 and @xmath43 , one gets @xmath137 .      still for the magnetized case @xmath20",
    ", one can learn more by considering selected aspects of the non - stationary regime .",
    "going back to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp - mag ] ) , one sees that , in the limit @xmath138 , i.e. , @xmath119 , the diffusive term becomes small and this regime is associated with just streaming in leading order .",
    "the non - stationary equation to be solved is thus : @xmath139 with @xmath140^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and defining @xmath143 such that @xmath144 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp - mag - ns ] ) turns into : @xmath145 whose general solution is : @xmath146 in order to have the condition @xmath138 fulfilled to a good extent , so that the scaling behavior predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : q2 ] ) could be unequivocally demonstrated , we used @xmath147 , @xmath148 .",
    "for such a choice , the localization length is @xmath149 .",
    "this allowed us to take values of @xmath10 equal to several hundred lattice spacings , which are both much larger than unity ( so discrete - lattice effects are negligible ) , and still much shorter than @xmath135 ( thus guaranteeing non - stationarity by a broad margin ) .    figure  [ fig : nsraw ] shows the region close to the central peaks of the pdfs ( where scaling is expected to hold ) , for @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nsscale ] the same data are shown in a scaling plot , as suggested by eq .  ( [ eq : q2 ] ) .",
    "note that the number of samples @xmath56 is one order of magnitude larger than , e.g. , that used in earlier sections of this work .",
    "this was necessary , in view of the relatively wide scatter of the pdfs : typically , they displayed almost flat tails running out to @xmath154 , so the relevant data as far as scaling is concerned were a small subset of the total gathered ( compare the horizontal scale in fig .",
    "[ fig : nsraw ] ) .",
    "even so , one can see , close to the bottom of the scaling curve in fig .  [",
    "fig : nsscale ] , that a non - negligible degree of fluctuation - induced spread still remains .",
    "nevertheless , overall agreement with the scaling predictions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : q2 ] ) is remarkable .",
    "we have investigated scaling properties of the probability distribution functions ( pdf ) of lyapunov exponents for the one - dimensional heisenberg - mattis spin glass .",
    "in section  [ sec:3a ] we showed that , for a given energy @xmath27 ( small enough , such that the localization length @xmath5 is sufficiently large for scaling concepts to apply ) , the pdf of the local lyapunov exponent ( lle ) @xmath155 , takes on a shape which , for @xmath156 , is increasingly close to a gaussian . in the limit @xmath64 , the pdfs turn into @xmath11 functions , in conformity with the central limit theorem .",
    "thus , such aggregate effects reflect only general statistical properties of fluctuations in systems with many ( almost- ) independent degrees of freedom .",
    "the connection with the underlying physical problem is traced exclusively through the dependence of the numerical value of the ( asymptotic ) lyapunov exponent with energy ( and ferromagnetic bond concentration ; though this latter aspect was not exploited here , it has been investigated before  @xcite ) .    on the other hand , the pdfs for the instantaneous lyapunov exponents , as defined via eq .",
    "( [ eq : instdef ] ) , display the following properties of interest , exhibited in sections  [ sec:3b ] , [ sec:3c ] , and  [ sec:3d ] : ( i ) for @xmath156 they approach a fixed , non - trivial shape with nonvanishing width ; ( ii ) such specific shape can be predicted through a connection with the stationary state of a fokker - planck ( f - p ) equation ; and ( iii ) the shape is a  fingerprint \" shared by all the systems in the universality class in which the statistical properties of the system lie .",
    "furthermore , the f - p equation providing the link can be set up directly from , and closely reflects , the physical features of the system under investigation [ see especially eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cont1])([eq : fp1 ] ) ] .",
    "the applicability of a description via an f - p equation goes beyond the stationary state , as shown in section  [ sec:3e ] .",
    "there , it is shown that the scaling of non - stationary pdfs in a specific regime ( in which diffusion effects are expected to be negligible ) closely follows predictions drawn from the corresponding form of the f - p equation .    in the present work we have demonstrated that an f - p approach can be successively applied to both stationary and non - stationary properties of the pdf of instantaneous lyapunov exponents for heisenberg - mattis spin glasses .    as a final remark , we believe that the scaling properties of the pdf of lyapunov exponents described here are identical to those pertinent to the zero - temperature random - bond ( @xmath157 ) classical heisenberg chain .",
    "this comes via the identification of the scaling properties of the low - energy excitations of the hsmg chain with those of the classical heisenberg model in 1d @xcite , plus the general applicability of the f - p equation in the continuum  @xcite .",

    "<S> we investigate the statistical properties of local lyapunov exponents which characterize magnon localization in the one - dimensional heisenberg - mattis spin glass ( hmsg ) at zero temperature , by means of a connection to a suitable version of the fokker - planck ( f - p ) equation . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the local lyapunov exponents ( lle ) , in particular the case of _ instantaneous _ lle . </S>",
    "<S> we establish a connection between the transfer - matrix recursion relation for the problem , and an f - p equation governing the evolution of the probability distribution of the instantaneous lle . </S>",
    "<S> the closed - form ( stationary ) solutions to the f - p equation are in excellent accord with numerical simulations , for both the unmagnetized and magnetized versions of the hmsg . scaling properties for non - stationary conditions </S>",
    "<S> are derived from the f - p equation in a special limit ( in which diffusive effects tend to vanish ) , and also shown to provide a close description to the corresponding numerical - simulation data . </S>"
