    "for the last decades , the investigation of the maximum excitation energy that a nuclear system can hold has remained as much a challenge as the description of the decay of a hot collision remnant , excited beyond the limits of nuclear binding .",
    "it is commonly assumed that other decay modes than fission and evaporation prevail at high excitation energy .",
    "these modes are often described as a simultaneous break - up of the hot system in many parts , named `` multifragmentation '' .",
    "the excitation energy above which multifragmentation appears is still a source of intense theoretical and experimental research .",
    "a point of particular interest is to recognise the distinguishing traits denoting this decay mode when the excitation is just sufficient for its onset . in line with this investigation ,",
    "one foremost aspect of intense discussion is the connection of the kinematics of the residues to the kind of equilibration process involved in the earliest stages of the decay .",
    "this question is related to the complementary effort in constructing physical models to deduce the formation cross sections of the residues when the excitation energy of the system is taken as initial condition .",
    "especially light residues are suited for this purpose .",
    "several details of the deexcitation mechanism could emerge from the kinematics of light fragments , due to the high sensitivity in probing the coulomb field of the decaying system .",
    "moreover , the distribution of their isotopic cross sections carry additional signatures connected to different decay modes .",
    "the experimental data exploited in this work are part of a vast experimental campaign devoted to the collection of nuclear data for the design of accelerator - driven subcritical reactors  @xcite and to the investigation of spallation reactions in the cosmos  @xcite .",
    "the full set of production cross sections and fragment mean recoil velocities measured in this framework for the reaction @xmath0fe@xmath3 and @xmath0fe@xmath4ti at energies ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6 mev is presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "light residues can be generated in several kinds of processes .",
    "one of these , the binary decay of an excited greatly thermalised complex , named compound nucleus , was widely studied  @xcite .",
    "we might also recall that evaporation of nucleons and light nuclei and symmetric fission are just the opposite extremes of the manifestation of this process : there is a gradual transition from very asymmetric to symmetric configurations in the division of decaying compound nuclei , and thus all binary decays of a greatly thermalised system can be named fission in a generalized sense .",
    "this generalization was introduced by moretto  @xcite .",
    "a compound system far below the businaro - gallone point  @xcite ( like iron - like nuclei ) undergoes very asymmetric fission , resulting in a characteristic u - shape in the mass distribution of the yields .",
    "a minimum located at symmetry in the yield mass spectrum corresponds to a maximum placed at symmetry in the ridge lines of the potential . in configurations where a heavy partner is present , the whole decay process is dominated by the binary decay , and an additional evaporation of single nucleons would not disturb the kinematics remarkably .",
    "such a process exhibits the typical feature of the population of the shell of a sphere in velocity space , in the reference frame of the mother nucleus .    at high excitation , multifragmentation becomes the competing process to compound - nucleus reactions .",
    "there is a fundamental difference between the binary decay of a compound nucleus and the simultaneous disintegration of a hot collision remnant in several constituents .",
    "the difference is in the kind of instabilities which are the reason for the decay , and is reflected in the kind and in the time evolution of the consequent equilibration process followed by the system .",
    "a hot nucleus with an excitation energy above the threshold for emission of particles or clusters ( including fission ) has the possibility to decay by any of the open channels .",
    "if the excited system is not too hot , the favoured process is a reordering of its configurations : a great number of arrangements are available where all nucleons remain in states below the continuum , occupying excited single - particle levels around the fermi surface .",
    "oscillations in fission direction are included in this picture as well , but too rarely the fission barrier is reached . rather seldom , compared with this thermal chaotic motion of the system ,",
    "one nucleon acquires enough energy to pass above the continuum and may eventually leave the nucleus . this picture might be extended to cluster decay and to fission . since this decay is a rare process , one evaporation event , or fission event , proceeds after the other , sequentially . in this process",
    ", the compound system follows a dynamic trajectory in deformation space , which is governed by the potential - energy surface and the dynamic properties of the compound system , related , for instance , to the inertia tensor and dissipation tensor .",
    "all decays are binary .     at ground state .",
    "system configurations are drawn as possible final results of the expansion phase .",
    "when the thermalization path leads to the coexistence region , out of the spinodal region , damped density fluctuations occur .",
    "in the spinodal region density fluctuations are unstable and lead to cracking . at low density freeze - out",
    "is attained with different possible partition configurations : fragments are free to leave the system . ]",
    "if the system becomes drastically more unstable , this picture is not valid anymore .",
    "the exploration of possible states of the excited system includes numerous unstable configurations .",
    "thus , the disintegration can not be understood as a sequence of binary decays , but rather portrayed as a simultaneous break - up in several constituents  @xcite .",
    "the disintegration is simultaneous in the sense that it evolves in so short a time interval ( @xmath7-@xmath8s ) that the ejected fragments can still exchange mutual interactions during their acceleration in the coulomb field of the system . in heavy - ion collisions , part of the excitation",
    "could be introduced in the system in the form of compressional energy . according to the impact parameter and the incident energy ,",
    "the interaction might result in a very complex interplay between dynamic effects ( beside compression , also deformation and rotation degrees of freedom ) and thermal excitation .",
    "this is the case of central collisions in the fermi - energy range . on the contrary ,",
    "peripheral heavy - ion collisions at relativistic energies may be rather pictured according to an `` abrasion '' process  @xcite , where the remnant is formed by the spectator nucleons , heated by mainly thermal energy . in this case , the role of compressional energy has minor incidence . even with proton projectiles , the multifragmentation regime might be accessible when very high excitation is introduced in the nucleus . in reactions induced by relativistic protons ( but also by very light nuclei ) , the dynamic effects of the collision have even smaller importance .",
    "the excitation energy is almost purely thermal .",
    "some authors even attributed the specific name of `` thermal multifragmentation '' to this particular process ( see the review articles  @xcite ) .",
    "it might be suggested that proton - induced relativistic collisions are better suited than ion - ion collisions for investigating thermal properties of nuclear matter ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in finite nuclei , the transition from the fission - evaporation mode to multifragmentation manifests rather smoothly .",
    "this opening of break - up channels even inspired interpretations in line with the liquid - gas phase transition of nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "the similarity of the nucleon - nucleon interaction with the lennard - jones molecular potential suggests that infinite neutral nuclear matter resembles a van - der - waals fluid  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , also in the phase diagram of nuclear matter an area of liquid - gas coexistence can be defined . in this region ,",
    "the `` dense '' phase of nuclear droplets is in equilibrium with the `` gaseous '' phase of free nucleons and light complex particles . within the hartree - fock approximation , according to the type of skyrme force chosen for obtaining the nuclear equation of state , the critical temperature @xmath9 was calculated to vary in a range of around 15 to 20 mev for nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "( one of the latest investigations , based on an improved fisher s model  @xcite indicated @xmath10 for finite nuclear systems .",
    "this value is source of controversy , e.g.  @xcite ) . during the reaction process",
    ", the system explores different regions of the phase diagram . since at relativistic energies",
    "the collision is related to short wavelengths , the hot remnant should reach high positive values of pressure @xmath11 due to thermal energy ( rather than mechanical compression , characteristic of fermi - energy collisions ) without deviating sensibly from the initial density @xmath12 .",
    "it is commonly assumed that at this stage the system is still not thermalised and it undergoes expansion in order to attain equilibrium ( there exist also opposite interpretations assuming thermalization already before expansion and a successive `` big - bang - like '' expansion out of equilibrium  @xcite ) .",
    "if the initial pressure is high enough , the subsequent expansion could lead to rather low densities , and the system , after dissipating the incoming momentum , could reach a point belonging to the spinodal region . due to the inverse relation between pressure and density @xmath13 , this region is unstable , and",
    "density fluctuations are magnified .",
    "the nucleus breaks apart due to spinodal instability .",
    "the system disassembles also due to coulomb instability .",
    "the inclusion of the long - range coulomb interaction in the equation of state was introduced by levit and bonche  @xcite , with the result that the solution of the coexistence equation vanishes above a `` limiting temperature '' @xmath14 , in general much lower than @xmath9 , depending on the conditions taken for the calculation ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "density fluctuations reflect a continuous evolution of the size and number of nuclear droplets from a configuration to another  @xcite .",
    "if the average mutual distance among the nucleons exceeds the strong nuclear interaction range ( i.e. about @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the average nucleon - nucleon collision cross section ) , the break - up configuration `` freezes '' and the formed nuclei and nucleons fly away freely , all carrying signatures of the so - called freeze - out temperature of their common source . from comparing results from different experimental approaches e.g.  @xcite this temperature is found to be restricted to a range of 5 to 6 mev ( corresponding to a range of excitation energy per nucleon around 2.5 to 3.5 mev ) , quite independently of the reaction .",
    "this finding , not directly compatible with the phase diagram of ideal nuclear matter even suggested to search for a `` characteristic temperature '' of fragmentation  @xcite . the break - up configuration at freeze - out is expected to reflect the excitation energy of the system .",
    "the dense phase of highly heated systems should have the aspect of an ensemble of copious almost - equal - size light fragments . at reduced excitation ,",
    "just sufficient for attaining the freeze - out , the break - up partition might evolve to more asymmetric configurations , where the formation of a heavy fragment close to the mass of the hot remnant is accompanied by one or more light fragments and clusters . as an extreme",
    ", this configuration might even reduce to a binary asymmetric decay . in the case of a very asymmetric split of the system ,",
    "the partition multiplicity has minor influence on the kinematics of the light ejectiles .",
    "the emission of light particles populates spherical shells in velocity space and can not be easily distinguished by the kinematics from a binary decay when large mass - asymmetries characterize the partition .",
    "a binary or binary - like decay issued from a break - up configuration is a `` fast '' process .",
    "compared to asymmetric fission , asymmetric break - up decays should result in a similar u - shape of the mass spectra of the yields .",
    "on the other hand , break - up decays should be reflected in the higher magnitude of the yields , and in the emission kinematics that , still mostly governed by the coulomb field , should exhibit an additional contribution due to the eventual expansion of the source .",
    "great part of the information on light - particle emission at high excitation energies was collected in 4-@xmath17-type experiments , suited for measuring the multiplicity and the correlations of intermediate - mass fragments  @xcite . still , the measurement of correlations and the linear - momentum - transfer was the basis for pursuing intense researches on the transition from the formation of compound nuclei to multifragmentation  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we discuss additional results derived from new inclusive measurements of the reactions @xmath0fe@xmath3 and @xmath0fe+@xmath1ti at 1 @xmath2 gev , effectuated in inverse kinematics with the fragment separator ( frs )  @xcite at gsi ( darmstadt ) .",
    "the experimental set - up was not intended to measure multiplicity and correlations , but to provide formation cross sections and high - resolution velocity spectra for isotopically identified projectile - like residues .",
    "the excitation of the @xmath0fe@xmath3 system consists of purely thermal energy , and it is just high enough to approach the conditions for the onset of multifragmentation . on the basis of these data we search for the properties of the early appearance of break - up events and their competition with compound - nucleus emission .",
    "the system @xmath0fe+@xmath1ti is compatible with an abrasion picture .",
    "the excitation energy deposited in the projectile spectator , still mostly of thermal nature , establishes the dominance of multifragmentation in the decay process .",
    "we will especially discuss the differences in the kinematics of light - fragment emission in the two systems , conditioned by two different levels of excitation magnitude .",
    "the experiment was performed at gsi ( darmstadt ) .",
    "a primary beam of @xmath0fe was delivered by the heavy - ion synchrotron sis at an energy of 1 @xmath2 gev .",
    "the target was constituted of liquid hydrogen ( with a thickness of @xmath18 mg/@xmath19 ) contained in a cryostat with thin titanium windows ( @xmath20 mg/@xmath19 in total ) , wrapped in thin mylar foils ( c@xmath21h@xmath22o@xmath23 , total thickness : @xmath24 mg/@xmath19 ) for thermal insulation . in the target area ,",
    "other layers of matter intersected the ion - beam : the accelerator - vacuum window of titanium ( @xmath25 mg/@xmath19 ) and the beam - current monitor composed of aluminium foils ( @xmath26 mg/@xmath19 ) . in order to disentangle the production and the physical results related to the interaction with hydrogen from the contribution associated to the other materials",
    ", the whole experimental runs were repeated in identical conditions , after replacing the target by titanium foils having the same thickness of the cryostat windows and wrapped in mylar foils having the same thickness of the cryostat insulation .",
    "this procedure did not only determine the disturbing contributions in the measurement of the @xmath0fe@xmath3 system , but it also provided additional experimental data on an other reaction system . with some arbitrariness we name `` titanium target ( @xmath1ti ) '' the ensemble of the titanium foils replacing the cryostat window , the mylar wrapping , the accelerator - vacuum window and the beam - current monitor .",
    "unfortunately , the measurement of the @xmath0fe+@xmath1ti system accounts also for non - titanium nuclei , the pollution of which corresponds to their portion in the total number of target nuclei per area and is equal to 25.9%  ( al )  +  7.2%  ( mylar )  =  33.1% .",
    "it should be remarked that these components are not placed at the same distance from the entrance of the spectrometer .",
    "fragments produced in the beam - current monitor or in the accelerator - vacuum window could have lower probabilities to be registered in the experiment since the angular acceptance is reduced by factors of 0.33 and 0.25 , respectively , compared to products from the titanium foils replacing the cryostat .",

    "the reaction products were analysed with the high - resolution magnetic spectrometer frs , constituted of four dipoles set in an achromatic mode .",
    "the horizontal positions of the reaction products were deduced from two plastic scintillators , the first positioned in a dispersive plane after the first two dipoles , the second installed in the final achromatic plane . from the time of flight ( @xmath30 ) , evaluated between the two scintillators , the relative velocity @xmath31 and the @xmath32-factor were obtained .",
    "the particle charge @xmath33 was measured with an ionisation chamber placed in front of the achromatic plane .",
    "since the reaction products were fully stripped , the nuclear charge @xmath34 was deduced directly .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] , the raw data collecting all the events measured in the experiment are shown .",
    "events are ordered according to the measured @xmath42 and @xmath40 so as to obtain an isotopic identification plot .",
    "the measurement of the time of flight is precise enough for an accurate identification of the mass of the fragments .",
    "nevertheless , mainly due to the resolution and additionally due to a slight dependence on the trajectory  @xcite it is not suited for a fine measurement of the velocities of the fragments . on the other hand , once an isotope is identified in mass and charge , a much more precise measurement of the velocity is obtained directly from the magnetic rigidity of the particle @xmath43 in this case , the precision of @xmath44 depends only on @xmath36 , that has a relative uncertainty of @xmath45 ( fwhm ) for individual reaction products . the absolute calibration of the deflection in the magnet in terms of magnetic rigidity @xmath36 is performed at the beginning of the experiment with a dedicated calibration run using the primary beam .",
    "since one single magnetic configuration of the frs selects only a @xmath36 range of about @xmath46 1.5% , several overlapping runs have been repeated imposing different magnetic fields . while for the heavy residues close to the projectile one or few settings were sufficient to cover the whole velocity spectrum , the light fragments often required more than ten runs .",

    "we should note that the spectrometer accepts only the fragments emitted in a cone of about @xmath49 mr around the beam - axis in the laboratory frame , when the reaction occurs in the hydrogen - target position . as a consequence ,",
    "a light residue like , for example , @xmath47li , generated in a collision at a beam energy of 1 @xmath2 gev can be detected only if emitted with small transverse momentum .",
    "the experimental spectrum represents the part of the density distribution in the velocity space selected by the angular acceptance of the spectrometer , projected on the longitudinal axis .",
    "unfortunately , the angular acceptance depends on the magnetic rigidity of the particles .",
    "as pointed out in the work  @xcite , for a given set - up of the spectrometer , the more the intersection of the trajectory of a particle with the dispersive or the achromatic planes is displaced from the centers , the lower is the acceptance angle of the frs .",

    "[ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "we also consider that the fragments slowed down in the remaining half of the target and , therefore , were emitted at higher velocity than the one we observed .",
    "the analysis so far illustrated was repeated for all the isotopes produced in the interaction with the target of liquid hydrogen enclosed in the cryostat .",
    "successively , the same procedure was applied to the corresponding isotopes produced in the interaction with the @xmath1ti target . as all spectra are normalized to the same beam dose , by subtracting the velocity spectra of the residues produced in @xmath0fe+@xmath1ti ( indicated by the hatched area in the plot ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) from those of the corresponding isotopes produced in the target of hydrogen stored in the cryostat , we could obtain the measured velocity distributions for the reaction with the liquid hydrogen .",
    "the resulting yields are unambiguously disentangled from any disturbing contributions produced by other material present in the target area .",
    "finally , the velocity spectra obtained for the @xmath0fe@xmath3 system were divided by the number of nuclei per area of the proton target .",
    "the resulting spectrum is shown in the diagram ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] . in the case of the @xmath0fe+@xmath1ti system",
    ", we should consider that the target is constituted of three components , the titanium foils replacing the cryostat , the beam - current monitor and the accelerator - vacuum window , having a number of nuclei per area equal to @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "we should also recall that these components are placed at different distances from the entrance of the spectrometer and are subjected to different values of the angular acceptance , that is about @xmath56 mr , @xmath57 mr , and @xmath58 mr , for the layers @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "thus , the cross sections given in this work for the `` titanium '' target are calculated using a target composition where the different layers are weighted by the corresponding estimated transmission values @xmath50 , assuming identical production cross sections in the different target components . in particular ,",
    "the velocity spectra obtained for the @xmath0fe+@xmath1ti system should be divided by the quantity @xmath59 .",
    "the experimental data are already complete enough to let us recognise an important signature of the coulomb repulsion : the double - humped spectrum reveals that the velocity of @xmath47li nuclei emitted at small angles has two components : one appreciably higher and one appreciably lower than the beam . according to the references  @xcite , where similar structures have been observed for fission fragments , we may connect the double - humped spectrum to the action of the coulomb field of a heavy partner in the emission process .",
    "once changed to longitudinal velocities in the beam - frame @xmath60 , the shift of the barycenter of the spectrum with respect to zero is equal to the mean reaction recoil @xmath61 .",
    "also this quantity , studied in the lower diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , carries a valuable information about the reaction mechanism , and it can be related to the friction suffered by the projectile in the collision , according to a given impact parameter  @xcite . due to the limited angular acceptance of the frs which favours the detection of heavier nuclei , a depletion of the statistics for the measurement of the lightest nuclei",
    "is expected when , as in this case , the light fragments are measured together with the heaviest in the same magnetic setting . due to these problems , the mean velocities of the light residues can only be determined with relatively large uncertainties . with these large uncertainties ,",
    "the information from the mean velocities could not be exploited .",
    "although these mean velocities also enter into the evaluation of the cross sections , the uncertainties they introduce are comparable to those from other sources .",
    "we preferred to deduce the mean recoil velocities of lithium , beryllium , boron and carbon by extrapolation from the systematics of the data relative to the ensemble of the heavier residues .",

    "the cross sections related to the latter system are scaled of a factor 0.07 .",
    "numerical values are collected in table  [ tab : tab1 ] . ]        when a fragment is emitted with a large absolute velocity @xmath62 in the center of mass , not all the angles of the corresponding velocity vector @xmath63 are selected by the finite angular acceptance of the spectrometer . as a result of the data analysis detailed in the previous section , we obtain the measurement of the apparent cross section @xmath64 as a function of the longitudinal velocity @xmath65 .",
    "this observed cross section differs from the real cross section due to the angular acceptance .",
    "the detection of a particle depends on the perpendicular velocity @xmath66 in the center - of - mass frame , the angle of rotation around the beam direction @xmath67 , and the velocity @xmath68 of the center of mass with respect to the laboratory .",
    "the dependence on @xmath67 comes about because the beam pipe inside the quadrupoles is not cylindrical .",
    "to reconstruct the full velocity distribution , independent of the angular acceptance of the spectrometer , an assumption on the angular distribution is necessary .",
    "it was concluded from experiments , to which the full angular range was accessible , that the data are in satisfactory agreement with an isotropic emission ( see , for example , the treatment of `` moving source analysis '' presented in  @xcite ) .",
    "this assumption has been corroborated by a vast collection of data for reactions of very different nature .",
    "isotropic emission has been observed either for lowly excited fissioning systems  @xcite , or even for very highly excited nuclei undergoing expansive flow in thermal multifragmentation  @xcite .",
    "at least the @xmath0fe@xmath3 system can be safely included in this range .",
    "slightly less justified is the assumption for @xmath0fe+@xmath1ti , since some effects of dynamical multifragmentation could disturb the isotropy .",
    "thus , if we assume isotropic particle emission in the center - of - mass frame , the variation of the cross section @xmath69 , as a function of the absolute velocity @xmath70 , is related to the variation of the apparent cross section @xmath71 as a function of @xmath65 by the equation ( see appendix  [ appendix : v_transmission ] ) : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the highest value of @xmath74 selected by the angular acceptance of the spectrometer , and @xmath67 is the rotation angle around the beam direction . as demonstrated in the appendix  [ appendix : v_inversion ] ,",
    "it is possible to reverse the relation  ( [ eq : equation3 ] ) and extract @xmath75 by the straightforward solution of a system of geometric relations .",

    "the extension of the production appears rather similar and , in particular , despite the expected difference in excitation energy reachable in the collisions with the two different targets , the cross - section distributions of the residues of the two reactions do not manifest drastic differences in their features . a more quantitative revelation of this similarity is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] , where the mass distributions are compared .",
    "the difference in the shape of the mass spectra is significant only for the intermediate masses : the cross section of the residues of @xmath0fe@xmath3 decreases from @xmath76 to @xmath77 by about one order of magnitude , while we observe only a slight decrease by about a factor of two for @xmath0fe+@xmath1ti .",
    "the data reveal that higher excitation energy introduced by the interaction with titanium , with respect to proton - induced spallation , results in decreasing the slope of the mass - spectra in the imf - range and depleting the cross section for heavy residues in favour of an enhanced production of light fragments .",
    "however , the portion of the mass spectra corresponding to light - particle emission follows a very similar exponential slope for both systems .      in the previous section",
    ", the full velocity distributions were reconstructed from the data and employed to obtain the residue formation cross sections for the reactions induced by the proton and titanium target , respectively .",
    "though , the cross sections did not yield any unambiguous distinction between the two reactions that , indeed , should result into rather different deexcitation pictures on the basis of the different thermal excitations reached in the two systems . on the contrary ,",
    "the particularity of the proton - induced spallation compared to the titanium - induced fragmentation arises strikingly when the kinematics of the light - particle emission is investigated .",

    "thus , when we compare the @xmath0fe@xmath3 system to the @xmath0fe+@xmath1ti system on the basis of the recoil velocity , we find that substantially distinct mechanisms should be involved in the light - fragment emission in the two systems . in the fragmentation reaction induced by the titanium target , all the residues are emitted according to a bell - shape velocity spectrum .",

    "the latter is calculated according to the model of karol  @xcite .",
    "the production cross - section ratio scales with the total cross - section ratio only in the region of higher masses , presumably coming from more peripheral collisions , while it deviates for lighter masses .",
    "the deviation must be related to the different mean multiplicities in the two reactions : lighter masses are more populated in the @xmath0fe+@xmath1ti reaction , and great part of this increase might be related to higher multiplicities .",
    "the observation of the gradual increase of multiplicity with the excitation of the system , verified in the calculation of different yield spectra associated to different energy ranges of hot remnants , could be followed further when extending to the @xmath0fe+@xmath1ti reaction . as pictured in the lower plots of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig19 ] , this behaviour is well reproduced by calculations with smm . in this respect",
    ", the light - residue production characterizing the @xmath0fe@xmath3 system might just be interpreted as the early onset of the process that will govern the decay of the @xmath0fe+@xmath1ti system .    to conclude this section on model calculations , we focus once more on the velocity spectra of the light fragments shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig16 ] .",
    "we already discussed the difficulty to combine the wide shapes of the velocity spectra and their mean values with a fission barrier .",
    "we inferred that the extensions of the velocity distributions to very high velocities might reflect higher kinetic energies than an asymmetric fission process could release . consistently with this expectation , on the basis of model calculations we could connect the production of light residues to very high excitation energies of the source . above around @xmath127 mev of excitation energy per nucleon , the process of light - residue production is still presumably dominated by binary decays , but the contribution of disintegration in more fragments is not excluded . in this case , parts of the distribution corresponding to smaller velocities should be more populated than in a purely binary split . in the representation of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig16 ] , this contribution would fill more central parts of the spectra when lower asymmetry characterizes the break - up partition . in a statistics of events",
    "where three about - equal - size fragments are produced simultaneously , the velocity spectrum of any of them will be gaussian - like .",
    "if three fragments are produced , of which two are considerably lighter than their heavy partner , the velocity spectra @xmath128 of the two light ejectiles will be double humped .",
    "another contribution in populating lower velocities could be associated to different break - up configurations , where the partner or the partners of the light residue have different masses . in this case , the spectrum is the folding of several binary - like components characterized by different spacing between the two maxima and different widths around the maxima , all this resulting in the superposition of two ( backward and forward ) triangular - like distributions that could eventually merge in a general bell - shape .",
    "we might also consider standard evaporation cooling down the break - up residues , emitted in some excited states . in this case , the secondary `` slow '' emission process operates outside of the common coulomb field of the fragmenting remnant , and would produce a general widening of the spectrum around its maxima .",
    "as portrayed in the second row of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig16 ] , smm describes very consistently the experimental spectra . in the third row",
    "the effect of the coulomb interaction and eventually the expansion is illustrated by referring to the center of mass of the system formed right after the intra - nuclear cascade and the preequilibrium , if included .",
    "smm calculates the coulomb interaction between fragments by placing them inside the freeze - out volume @xmath124 .",
    "contrarily to gemini , it takes into account different positions of the fragments , including two - body and many - body partitions .",
    "some multifragmentation channels may resemble a two - body process even at relatively high excitation energy .",
    "these channels can also include additional small fragments which may look like evaporation ones .",
    "however , these additional small fragments can essentially change the coulomb interaction in the volume and the thermal energy in the system , and influence the kinetic energies of the main two fragments .",
    "the binary character characterizing the experimental results is properly reproduced and the velocity distributions calculated with smm are wider than those obtained from gemini .",
    "li , as calculated by smm .",
    "the representation is the same as in the second column of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig16 ] . ]    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig20 ] , the gradual filling of the center of the spectra could be related to different break - up configurations and to possible multibody disintegration .",
    "the abrupt change of shape in passing from @xmath87c to @xmath88c ( correctly reproduced by smm ) might be related to the more favoured evaporation channel toward the formation of @xmath88c , that could collect several different decay processes and evaporation decays from neighbouring nuclei .",
    "this preferential decay toward @xmath88c smears out any binary character of the spectrum . as",
    "the break - up configuration varies with the mass and the charge of the end - product , it varies also with the excitation energy available for the disassembly of the hot remnant .",
    "this was evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig17 ] , where we compared the production cross sections of the residues , and it is also evident in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig16 ] , by analysing the velocity spectra .",
    "it is evident that the suppression of the preequilibrium induces a smearing effect on the spectra .",
    "this effect is dramatic for @xmath47li as the double - humped spectrum is completly smeared out in one large single hump with a flat top , and it becomes similar to the velocity spectrum of @xmath47li produced in the even more excited @xmath0fe+ @xmath1ti system .",
    "the mechanisms of light - particle emission from two systems , @xmath0fe@xmath3 and @xmath0fe+ @xmath1ti at 1 @xmath2 gev , have been investigated .",
    "the latter was regarded as a baseline for very high - energy processes ( multifragmentation ) .",
    "we focused mainly on the proton - induced reaction .",
    "the certain understanding that we could attain from the analysis of the @xmath0fe@xmath3 system is that light residues are produced in the decay of highly excited remnants .",
    "furthermore , from a more quantitative discussion , we inferred that the emitting source should also be heavy and close to the projectile mass .",
    "the magnitude of the coulomb repulsion , together with the very high formation yields even suggested that an asymmetric break - up process , hardly connected to asymmetric fission or statistical cluster emission , might be the favoured channel of light - residue production .",
    "these findings were derived from experimental observables like the isotopic cross sections measured for the whole ensemble of the residues , and the velocity distributions of the emitted fragments in the projectile frame along the beam axis .",
    "especially the shape of the velocity spectra offered us a microscopic insight into the mechanisms of light - particle emission . in analysing the features of the velocity spectra , we failed in describing the kinematics within a general systematics of fission total - kinetic - energy release . a complete simulation of the whole reaction process , where sequential fission - evaporation decays govern the deexcitation , could not consistently describe the gross experimental features of the decay .",
    "we suggested that the characteristics of the kinematics and the production of light particles could carry indications of fast asymmetric splits .",
    "a novel description of the complete reaction process , including channels of fast break - up decays revealed to be more adapted in depicting the decay of the most highly excited remnants , and was compatible with the high yields for light residues and the complex shapes of the velocity spectra .",
    "encouraged by this consistency and , first of all , on the basis of previous theoretical and experimental results ( see references in the section  [ sec : discussion ] ) , we suggested that protons at incident energies of 1 @xmath2 gev traversing iron - like nuclei can introduce very high thermal excitation energy per nucleon in the system , even above 2.5 mev .",
    "such a thermal excitation could lead to attain freeze - out conditions .",
    "we assume that if the excitation energy is high but not sufficient to lead to freeze - out , the system might still expand , but without reaching the break - up phase , the expansion subsequently reverses to compression in a path toward the formation of a compound nucleus .",
    "this behaviour might occur before the nucleus cools down by fission - evaporation decays . on the contrary , when the excitation energy is just sufficient to access break - up channels , partitions with low multiplicity of intermediate - mass fragments and high asymmetry",
    "are favoured : the decay results mainly in the simultaneous formation of one heavy residue , with mass close to the hot remnant , and one or more light clusters and nucleons . as an extreme case",
    ", two fragments rather asymmetric in mass may be formed in the same fast break - up process .",
    "the formation of light fragments in the @xmath0fe@xmath3 reaction could be explained by this picture .",

    "if the value is known on the right non - overlapping extremity , the variation between the two adjacent @xmath130 bins delivers the value on the left non - overlapping extremity .",
