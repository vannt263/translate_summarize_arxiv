    "half - doped perovskite manganites re@xmath3a@xmath3mno@xmath4 ( re - rare earth , a - alkaline earth ) exhibit very specific properties quite different from manganites with other @xmath5 electron concentrations.@xcite generally , for large size re and a cations or when external pressure is applied@xcite these compounds are in the a - type antiferromagnetic ( af ) , metallic state at low temperatures showing no or only weak sign of charge ordering , and the occupied @xmath5 electron states are predominantly @xmath6 like .",
    "recently it has been reported that the a - phase may develop an intrinsic charge - stripe modulation , which controls the transport properties.@xcite with decreasing size of the cations , which implies a decrease of the bandwidth , charge ordering is observed which at lower temperatures is accompanied by the formation of peculiar ferromagnetic ( fm ) zigzag chains@xcite that are staggered antiferromagnetically .",
    "this ce spin order , a notation introduced in the pioneering work of wollan and koehler@xcite and goodenough@xcite , is accompanied by a checkerboard charge order ( co ) and directed occupied orbitals on the mn@xmath7 sites amplifying double exchange ( de ) along one lattice diagonal .",
    "the ce - structure is a particularly fascinating manifestation of the control of magnetic order due to the orbital degree of freedom@xcite in combination with charge ordering .",
    "although a number of approaches have been followed to explain this structure , the mechanism for its stability is still not clear and hotly debated with emphasis put on the role of the de,@xcite the coulomb interaction,@xcite or the coupling to the lattice degrees of freedom.@xcite    the ce phase has been observed experimentally both in cubic ( nd , pr)@xmath3(sr , ca)@xmath3mno@xmath4@xcite and in layered lasr@xmath8mn@xmath8o@xmath9@xcite and la@xmath3sr@xmath10mno@xmath11@xcite manganites . in some cases",
    "it can coexist with the a - type af spin ordering.@xcite regarding co in the ce phase , some experiments are interpreted in terms of almost perfect co @xcite while others@xcite are considered to be consistent with a smooth charge density wave ( cdw ) of the @xmath5 electron density . although , it is plausible that the complex spin and orbital arrangement in the charge - ordered manganites can result from the competition between de@xcite and af superexchange interactions ( @xmath12 ) , the role played by the co and jahn - teller ( jt ) interactions@xcite in the system is still unclear .",
    "finally in systems like e.g. pr@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath4 co and ce - type orbital correlations are found to develop well above the neel temperature@xcite or even coexist with fm spin state,@xcite which indicates that these orbital correlations are not primarily driven by magnetic interactions .",
    "this work focuses on a microscopic understanding of the stability of the ce - phase which appears to be the ground state of narrow band manganites at and near quarter - filling .",
    "we argue here that the key interaction , apart from the nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion @xmath13 which supports the charge ordering,@xcite is the next - nearest neighbor jt interaction . this interaction between orbitals at next - nearest neighbor mn@xmath7 ions emerges from the jt - distortions of the mn@xmath7 octahedra which is amplified by the breathing distortion of the intermediate mn@xmath14 octahedra .",
    "we show that this interaction generates a narrow regime in the @xmath13-@xmath15 phase diagram where the ce - phase ( and sometimes the c - phase ) is stable .",
    "otherwise one encounters a homogeneous fm phase at small @xmath15 fully controlled by de and a conventional nearest - neighbor af phase at larger @xmath15 .",
    "an important feature of further neighbor jt interactions are the displacements of the mn@xmath14 ions .",
    "we are only aware of work by radaelli _ _ et al.__@xcite where detailed lattice coordinates for the ce - phase in la@xmath3ca@xmath3mno@xmath4 are reported .",
    "in particular they observed that the 4 planar o(2 ) move towards the mn@xmath14 ion and the mn@xmath14 ions are found to be displaced from their regular perovskite positions , while the mn@xmath7 ions are not shifted .",
    "this observation confirms the importance of the breathing distortion and also shows the mechanism of the further neighbor jt - distortion in the ce - phase . as a consequence the appearance of new bragg reflections in the ce - phase would be associated not primarily with quadrupolar electronic orbital order but rather with the displacements of ions associated with the ce orbital order.@xcite    an alternative long - ranged jt based interaction was recently proposed by khomskii and kugel@xcite and by calderon , millis and ahn.@xcite they employ elasticity theory to derive the orbital interaction between jt - distorted mn@xmath7o@xmath16 octahedra for the perfectly charge ordered case .",
    "we have also investigated the consequences of this interaction .",
    "our numerical simulations confirm the estimate presented in ref .",
    "that for perfect charge ordering the af ce phase is stable .",
    "yet in this model this requires large nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion @xmath13 , while for moderate values of @xmath13 the ce phase gets unstable .    the finite temperature diagonalization@xcite used in our study allows to include the full interplay of spin and orbital states , and to monitor the onset of different orders as function of temperature .",
    "this gives us the ability for an unbiased investigation of the formation of different spin - orbital orderings emerging from all multi - electron configurations in the cluster . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the stability and temperature dependence of spin , orbital , and charge ordered states in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) realistic model for half - doped manganites . in",
    "our microscopic spin - orbital model co develops as a result of nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion @xmath13 and as a consequence of further neighbor jt interactions , while the spin - orbital order results from the competition between de ( i.e. kinetic energy ) , af superexchange and further neighbor jt interactions . as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : nnnjt ] the latter interaction can lead to a co state at low temperatures even in the absence of inter - site coulomb repulsion . furthermore we argue that a topological sign in the hopping amplitudes of @xmath5 orbitals@xcite invoked in one - dimensional ( 1d ) models for the ce phase is not sufficient to explain the formation of ce spin - orbital structure in the 2d model studied by us .",
    "further motivations to put effort in a better understanding of the interplay of spin , charge , orbitals and lattice in the formation of the ce - phase are the following : it has been argued that the intrinsic mechanism that leads to colossal magnetoresistance are tendencies towards ce - type charge and orbital ordering in the vicinity of @xmath17.@xcite furthermore a ce - insulator to fm - metal transition has been observed in relatively small magnetic field , which is accompanied by a major change of the optical conductivity on a surprisingly large energy scale ( @xmath18 ev).@xcite such dramatic changes in relatively weak magnetic fields are a clear manifestation of the subtle interplay between spin , orbital and co. the present study provides a basis for further investigations of the temperature dependence of e.g. the optical conductivity and the study of spin and orbital excitations in the ce - phase , as well as the effect of doping into the quarter filled state .",

    "the @xmath40 part of the total hamiltonian alone represents the de mechanism and yields a fm ground state with @xmath41 orbitals being occupied which is favored by the kinetic energy in 2d model .",
    "such a fully spin polarized case at finite @xmath42 leads to _ the orbital @xmath43-@xmath44 model _ as considered in refs .  .",
    "here , we are interested in the more complex case where both spin and orbital degrees of freedom play an active role . therefore , an af ( @xmath45 ) coupling between nearest - neighbor @xmath0 spins is also incorporated , @xmath46 in our numerical studies we assume @xmath47 for the core spins which decreases the resulting hilbert space considerably .",
    "we have tested that this assumption gives similar results as in the @xmath36 case when @xmath19 is renormalized@xcite by the factor @xmath48 . moreover , to promote the charge ordering as observed experimentally in half - doped manganites we include the coulomb repulsion ( @xmath49 ) between @xmath5 electrons on neighboring sites,@xcite @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "this term reduces the probability of occupancy of neighboring sites by @xmath5 electrons .",
    "the form of the inter - site oo interactions included in the @xmath52 term of the hamiltonian will be specified in the following section .      to investigate the possible spin and orbital orderings in our spin - orbital model ( [ eq : h_total ] )",
    "we have calculated the temperature dependence of different two - site correlation functions given by the operator expectation value : @xmath53 of two - site operators , @xmath54 with @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , or @xmath58 with @xmath59.@xcite here , @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the number of basis states @xmath62 that span @xmath63 , @xmath64 number of sites in the cluster and @xmath65 is the partition function .",
    "the calculation of ( [ eq : a_r_exact ] ) would , however , require a complete diagonalization of a @xmath66 matrix of the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , we use for the calculation of @xmath67 a generalization of the exact diagonalization technique developed by jakli and prelovek.@xcite in this approach the trace of the thermodynamic expectation value is performed by a monte carlo sampling leading to the following approximate expression : @xmath68 where the first sum is performed over a restricted number @xmath69 of random states @xmath70 being initial states in the lanczos algorithm to generate a set @xmath71 of eigenfunctions of @xmath63 with respective eigenvalues @xmath72 .",

    "we begin the description of our calculations with a simplified model ( without @xmath87 term ) but including the crystal - field splitting of @xmath5 orbitals @xmath88 , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the @xmath91 component of the pseudospin operator .",
    "this orbital splitting accounts for the elongation of octahedra along the c - axis in layered compounds , which favors @xmath92 over @xmath41 orbital occupation , and also counterbalances the trend towards occupation of @xmath41 orbitals , which is strongly favored by the kinetic energy in the 2d - model .",

    "this leads to a @xmath320 matrix problem : @xmath321 \\left(\\begin{array}{c } d_{b , k}\\\\ d_{x , k}\\\\ d_{z , k}\\end{array } \\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath322 ( @xmath323 ) and @xmath324 ( @xmath325 ) are the hopping elements for the ce ( c ) phase , respectively , in the @xmath28 orbital basis .",

    "for the degenerate band model ( @xmath328 ) the c phase is metallic while in the ce phase a gap opens due to the _",

    "when the degeneracy between @xmath41 and @xmath92 states at the corner sites ( @xmath329 ) is lifted , the c phase becomes insulating as well and for sufficiently large @xmath5 level splittings it can have a _ lower _ energy than the ce phase when the chain is doped with one electron per two mn sites [ see fig .

    "thus , in the 1d model the relevant part of the phase diagram ( fig .  [ fig:1d_phase ] ) is the region with @xmath333 and @xmath334 , i.e. , where the ce structure dominates .    to relate our mean - field considerations to the model from sec .",
    "[ sec : nnjt ] the stability of the ce phase versus c was also considered with level splitting at the corner sites defined with respect to the orbital basis @xmath327 .",

    "[ fig:1d_phase](b ) the ce phase is stable for small splittings ( @xmath336 ) and in the @xmath335 , @xmath330 region .",
    "the latter is the relevant parameter range in the case of nearest neighbor jt interactions , and hence the model suggests the ce phase as stable phase .",
    "this , however , is in conflict with our numerical study of the 2d model , where only the c phase was found to be stable . as in 2d the nearest neighbor jt interaction stabilizes the c structure , whereas this interaction is frustrated in the ce phase .",
