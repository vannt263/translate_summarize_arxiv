    "effective lagrangians @xcite have been used for a long time as a systematic method to incorporate the known symmetries of a problem into the quantum field theory language . however , with the advent of yang - mills theories and the higgs mechanism , which allowed the construction of physically interesting renormalizable theories , they were used only for those problems that could not be treated in any other way . particularly important have been its applications to low - energy strong interactions in the form of the so - called chiral perturbation theory @xcite and more recently the heavy quark effective field theory @xcite .",
    "its application to weak interactions has been less intensive , since in the last decade the main effort has been in the direction of building complete renormalizable theories that could serve as alternatives or extensions of the standard model , by just enlarging the number of fermions , gauge bosons and scalars .",
    "renormalizability was considered to be a main point and completely linked to predictability , because non - renormalizable models need an infinite number of parameters to be completely described .",
    "the striking confirmation of many of the standard model predictions in lep experiments has started to change this point of view .",
    "almost every one now thinks that the standard model correctly describes physics at present energies and perhaps also up to energies close to the tev range .",
    "of course , supersymmetric particles and other elusive particles , such as neutral heavy leptons or right - handed neutrinos , with some hidden interactions and masses much lighter than 1 tev , are not excluded . on the other hand ,",
    "the theoretical developments achieved since the beginning of the seventies have brought a new interpretation of renormalizability @xcite .",
    "nowadays renormalizability is not understood as a calculational requirement or a consistency requirement .",
    "in fact one knows how to calculate , for example , with the fermi lagrangian , as long as one does not try to use it beyond the fermi scale .",
    "the key idea is that one does not expect a quantum field theory , even a renormalizable one , to be valid up to arbitrarily large energy scales .",
    "renormalizability is then seen as the physical requirement that physics at low energies can not dramatically depend on the physics at some large scale",
    ". there could be effects of the heavy particles on the low - energy physics , but all of them must be suppressed by some power of the scale @xmath1 at which the new physics starts .",
    "then , for each range of energies one expects that physics is described by a lagrangian of the form : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a renormalizable lagrangian that describes the low - energy physics and @xmath4 are linear combinations of non - renormalizable operators of dimension @xmath5 . for processes involving energies @xmath6 much smaller than @xmath1 ,",
    "the effects of the non - renormalizable operators are suppressed by @xmath7 and can systematically be computed .",
    "of course , they depend on more arbitrary parameters , but , if the underlying theory is known and if it is renormalizable , they can , in principle , be computed in terms of the few renormalizable couplings of the underlying theory by matching the calculation of several observables or green functions done with both theories : the full theory and the effective one . this picture is known as the decoupling case @xcite , as the effects of heavy particles decouple from the low - energy physics , and a well - known example is physics in the 580  gev range . there",
    ", physics can be well described by a @xmath8-@xmath9 renormalizable gauge - invariant lagrangian involving the five light quarks and the leptons , supplemented by four - fermion non - renormalizable interactions that take into account the effects of weak interactions .",
    "these non - renormalizable couplings can be computed in terms of the standard model couplings by matching some green functions at the fermi scale .",
    "but once this matching is done all calculations , including @xmath8 and @xmath9 radiative corrections , can be performed at the effective lagrangian level . since the full standard model is @xmath8 and @xmath9 gauge invariant one obtains that all the effective couplings must also be @xmath8 and @xmath9 gauge invariant .",
    "following the previous reasoning one can then expect that the standard model is not valid for an arbitrarily large range of energies and that it is just a low - energy approximation of a more complete theory .",
    "there are many arguments suggesting that this is the case .",
    "in particular , the so - called naturalness problem of the standard model , which will be discussed later on in the context of our effective lagrangian , and the large amount of arbitrary input parameters needed to describe the standard model are among the most popular ones .",
    "if the standard model is just a low - energy approximation of a more complete theory , one would expect that new non - renormalizable couplings suppressed by the scale of the new physics should arise . in complete parallelism",
    "one would also expect these non - renormalizable interactions to be gauge invariant with respect to the standard model gauge group .",
    "however , a complication arises since the @xmath10 gauge symmetry of the standard model is spontaneously broken to @xmath11 .",
    "then , when building an effective theory for physics beyond the standard model , there are two possibilities :    * the gauge symmetry is linearly realized .",
    "this means that radial excitations of the scalar field are relatively light ; then , for energies larger than the mass of these excitations , the symmetry is effectively restored .",
    "this is the simplest situation , in which the effective lagrangian is constructed with exactly the same particle content as the standard model particle spectrum and non - renormalizable interactions are required to be @xmath10 gauge invariant .",
    "* the gauge symmetry is non - linearly realized . that is , the physics of spontaneous symmetry breaking is non - linear .",
    "the radial excitations are heavy with respect to the fermi scale ; then , there is a wide range of energies between the fermi scale and the scale of new physics in which the full standard gauge symmetry is present , but realized in a non - linear way . in this region of energies one can still write an effective lagrangian , but the first term of that lagrangian is a non - renormalizable non - linear sigma model @xcite .",
    "there is a big difference between these two possibilities .",
    "the second one assumes that the new physics is responsible for spontaneous symmetry breaking ; as a consequence it must start not far away from the fermi scale , since it must correct the bad behaviour of the standard model without higgs particles . in the first one ,",
    "however , the higgs mechanism is fully implemented .",
    "low - energy physics decouples completely from high - energy physics and the only way to get some hint on the scale of the possible new physics ( apart from naturalness arguments ) is just by looking at the size of the non - renormalizable interactions .",
    "experimental bounds are then the only source of information .",
    "a very simple and instructive illustration of the use of effective lagrangians to bound new physics is the so - called see - saw mechanism for the generation of neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the only @xmath10 gauge - invariant operator of dimension five that can be built with the field content of the standard model is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the standard left - handed doublet of leptons , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the charge conjugation operator ) , @xmath17 is the higgs doublet and @xmath18 ; @xmath19 is a complex symmetric matrix in flavour space ( @xmath20 and flavour indices have been suppressed ) .",
    "it is clear that this lagrangian does not conserve generational lepton numbers , but in addition it does not conserve the total lepton number , which is violated in two units .",
    "this kind of operator will be generated in any theory that does not conserve lepton number .",
    "when the higgs develops a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , it will generate a neutrino majorana mass matrix given by @xmath21 if we take the largest eigenvalue of @xmath19 to be of order 1 , the higgs vev @xmath22=  174  gev and use the experimental bound on the @xmath23-neutrino mass , @xmath24  mev , we find that @xmath25  gev",
    ". should one take the cosmological bound @xcite on neutrino masses , @xmath26  ev , one would obtain @xmath27  gev .",
    "these bounds are really impressive . but",
    "what is @xmath1 ?",
    "the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ see - saw1 ] ) seems to be generated by the exchange of a scalar triplet with hypercharge 1 between the leptons and the higgses .",
    "then , @xmath1 should be the mass of that triplet .",
    "however this is not the only possibility .",
    "in fact , eq .  ( [ see - saw1 ] ) can be identically rewritten , after a @xmath20 fierz transformation , as @xmath28 which suggests the exchange of a neutral heavy majorana fermion ; then @xmath1 should be the mass of that fermion .",
    "indeed , the original formulation of the see - saw mechanism@xcite was based on this possibility .",
    "this simple example shows the power and the limitations of the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "one can set impressive bounds on the scale of new physics , but one can not completely disentangle its origin , at least by taking into account only the lowest - order operators .    it must also be remarked that in the effective lagrangian approach it is essential to know what the low - energy particle spectrum is .",
    "one generally assumes that it is just the standard model particle spectrum , but there could exist light particles , completely neutral under the standard model gauge group , that interact with the standard model particles only through the exchange of new heavy particles .",
    "this is not at all an exotic situation since it is what happened with weak interactions : neutrinos are singlets under @xmath9 and @xmath8 ; however , they can not be ignored in building an effective lagrangian that describes weak interactions .    keeping in mind all these limitations",
    ", one can very efficiently use the effective lagrangian approach to new physics to set bounds on operators that violate some of the global symmetries of the standard model : lepton number conservation , baryon number conservation or flavour symmetries @xcite .",
    "these bounds are naturally implemented at tree level in the effective lagrangian ( although the effective operators could be generated through loops in the full theory ) . during the last years , using the precise data obtained from experiment , people have started to consider the possibility of bounding operators that do not violate any symmetry of the standard model @xcite .",
    "this task is much more complicated because the number of operators of a given dimension is very large @xcite ( after using the equations of motion and without taking into account flavour , buchmller and wyler @xcite found 80 @xmath10 gauge invariant dimension - six operators constructed from the standard model fields ) .",
    "especially interesting is the analysis of effective operators contributing to trilinear gauge - boson couplings , since they could have important consequences at lep2 , the ssc and lhc @xcite .",
    "some of these operators also contribute to lep1 observables at tree level and they are strongly bounded by the lep very precise measurements .",
    "others do not contribute at tree level to lep1 observables , but only in loops @xcite .",
    "the next step is to use the effective lagrangian at the one - loop level and try to set bounds on all operators by using radiative corrections .",
    "this analysis is even more complicated since the effective theory is non - renormalizable in the standard sense and care must be taken with divergences , especially when the full theory is not known . if the full theory is known , it is not difficult to find the right prescription to absorb all infinities in the effective theory .",
    "all couplings must be renormalized , and matching to the full theory fixes all the counterterms .",
    "if the full theory is not known , the theory still has to be renormalized and infinities absorbed in the various couplings ; however , the finite parts of the counterterms remain arbitrary and can not be determined .",
    "the way this is done has created some controversy in the literature . the most general trilinear interaction among vector bosons",
    "can be constructed by imposing only lorentz invariance and qed gauge invariance @xcite . in the last years",
    "several groups have used such interactions in loops .",
    "calculations were performed by using a momentum cut - off that was identified with the scale of new physics . then , large effects were found since , in some cases , the diagrams were quadratically or even quartically divergent .",
    "this approach is not always correct , because the effective theory also has to be renormalized , couplings must be defined at some scale and they must satisfy some renormalization group equations .",
    "criticisms to this treatment of effective lagrangians have already been raised by several groups @xcite ; however , the emphasis was put on different aspects .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite stressed the importance of the gauge invariance of the effective lagrangian under the standard model gauge group . while , for example , in refs .  @xcite the emphasis was put on the incorrect use of cut - offs in previous calculations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study some of the questions that arise when the effective lagrangian approach to new physics is used by working out completely an example of possible new physics .",
    "we consider the simplest non - trivial extension of the standard model we could write down : a standard model supplemented by a singly charged scalar singlet coupled to leptons @xcite . we construct the full model and obtain a low - energy effective field theory by integrating out , at the one - loop level , the heavy scalar singlet . by construction , since the full theory is @xmath10 gauge invariant and we integrate out a complete scalar multiplet , we automatically obtain a @xmath10 gauge invariant effective theory .",
    "therefore , we do not discuss the role of gauge invariance in the construction of the effective theory .",
    "we use this example to study the renormalization of the effective lagrangian and to study the matching conditions that relate the parameters of the effective lagrangian to the parameters of the full lagrangian ensuring agreement between the two theories at low energies .",
    "the possibility of using the equations of motion before or after spontaneous symmetry breaking is illustrated as well .",
    "the model is also phenomenologically interesting because the presence of the scalar gives rise to very interesting phenomena @xcite such as , for example , the processes @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath31 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath31 .",
    "there are also additional contributions to the masses of the gauge bosons , new neutral current interactions , etc .",
    "of course , this analysis is quite far from being general , it is a very specific model that leads to a linearly realized gauge symmetry , but in spite of its simplicity it leads , already at the one - loop level , to many of the operators classified in refs .",
    "it can also help us to understand some of the tricky points discussed in the literature .    in section [ fulllagrangian ]",
    "we will introduce the notation and write down the lagrangian of the full theory . in section [ intscalar ]",
    "we obtain the tree - level and the one - loop contributions to the effective lagrangian of diagrams with only heavy scalars in internal lines by using functional methods .",
    "when using the tree - level effective interactions at the one - loop level in the effective lagrangian , new effective operators appear as counterterms that must be computed by matching the full theory results with the effective lagrangian results ; we do this job in section [ matching ] .",
    "renormalization of our effective lagrangian and the possibility of using effective lagrangians in general at the one - loop level to bound new physics are discussed in section [ renormalization ] . in section [ ssb ]",
    "we discuss the use of the classical equations of motion to rewrite the effective lagrangian in a convenient form for phenomenological analyses .",
    "we also discuss the impact of spontaneous symmetry breaking on this lagrangian and extract the relevant interactions in terms of the physical fields . in section [ pheno ] we shortly comment on some of the most interesting phenomenological consequences of the model by using the effective lagrangian we have obtained .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusion ] we review what we have learned about the use of effective lagrangians with our example .",
    "we include in appendix [ det ] the calculation of the determinant of the fluctuation operator , in appendix  [ heavy - light ] the calculation of the diagrams with heavy - light lines , and finally in appendix [ fcdecay ] we calculate the amplitudes for @xmath36 in both the full and the effective theory .",
    "[ fulllagrangian ]    the complete renormalizable model we are considering is an extension of the standard model , which contains a singly charged scalar singlet in addition to the standard model particles .",
    "this model is one of the simplest extensions one could imagine , but in spite of its simplicity , it already includes many interesting features common to any extension of the standard model containing a large mass scale compared with the fermi scale . for completeness",
    "we list below the particle spectrum of the full model and give the corresponding transformation properties with respect to the gauge group @xmath37 + 0.5 cm    [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     0.5 cm all possible @xmath20 and generational indices are suppressed above .",
    "the full lagrangian can be split into two parts : @xmath38 the first part , @xmath39 , represents the standard model lagrangian : @xmath40 where the covariant derivative can be written in the general form @xmath41 by @xmath42 and @xmath43 we denote the generators of the @xmath20 and the @xmath44 groups , accordingly , which are acting on the proper representations of the groups . in the case of @xmath20 doublets @xmath45 , where @xmath46 are @xmath47 pauli matrices . for @xmath44-triplets @xmath48 , where @xmath49 are @xmath50 gell - mann matrices . in the lagrangian ( [ smlagrangian ] ) the yukawa couplings , @xmath51 , are arbitrary complex matrices in flavour space .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath52 contains the interactions of the scalar singlet : @xmath53 and the covariant derivative in eq .",
    "( [ lsinglet ] ) has the form @xmath54 , because the @xmath55-scalar is an @xmath20 singlet with hypercharge @xmath56 .    for further applications it is convenient to rewrite the @xmath55-dependent part of the lagrangian , using integration by parts for the covariant derivative , in the following form : @xmath57    the quantum numbers of the scalar singlet are such that there is no interaction between the scalar singlet @xmath55 and the quarks in the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ lsinglet ] ) .",
    "it is also important to note that its coupling to the leptons , @xmath58 , is an antisymmetric complex matrix in flavour space .",
    "the antisymmetry of this matrix is a consequence of fermi statistics and the fact that the current @xmath59 is an @xmath20 scalar .",
    "then , one can write @xmath60 , from which the antisymmetry of the coupling easily follows .",
    "this property of the scalar - lepton coupling is very important since it naturally leads to a violation of the generational lepton numbers and all the interesting phenomenology related to it .",
    "however , if every lepton carries a total lepton number of 1 , we can assign a total lepton number of 2 to the scalar @xmath55 and , then , the lagrangian ( [ lsinglet ] ) is invariant with respect to a global symmetry , which can be identified as conservation of the total lepton number . as a consequence ,",
    "the neutrinos remain massless at all orders .",
    "models very similar to the one defined in eq .",

    "[ intscalar ]    if the mass @xmath61 of the scalar @xmath55 is much larger than the energy available to experiment , the only effects of this particle on the low - energy observables come through virtual corrections .",
    "these effects can be taken into account by using an effective lagrangian of the form ( [ firsteq ] ) , containing only the `` light '' fields of the model and where the effects of the `` heavy '' particle are included in the non - renormalizable terms of dimension larger than four , which are suppressed by inverse powers of the heavy mass @xmath61 .",

    "[ conclusion ]    in this paper we have studied some questions related to the construction and the use of effective lagrangians , by considering an extension of the standard model that includes a heavy charged scalar coupled to the leptonic doublet .    starting from the full renormalizable model , we have built a low - energy effective field theory by integrating out the heavy scalar .",
    "this was done at the one - loop level and keeping only operators of dimension six or less .",
    "functional methods were used to obtain , in a compact and gauge - invariant form , all operators generated by tree - level and one - loop diagrams containing only heavy scalars in the internal lines .",
    "the result includes only diagrams which are one - particle - irreducible with respect to the light particles . in appendix  [ det ]",
    "we give a detailed explanation of this calculation .",
    "this is not the complete answer for the effective lagrangian , since there are many one - loop diagrams in the full theory , with heavy and light particles in the loop that are not completely taken into account by one - loop diagrams involving tree - level effective couplings . to obtain these additional contributions",
    "we have calculated several green functions in both the full and the effective theories and required that the results of both calculations match for small momenta compared with the heavy scalar mass .",
    "the result can be expressed as a linear combination of gauge - invariant operators , which must be included in the effective lagrangian .    adding both contributions , from the operators corresponding to the diagrams with only heavy lines and from those with heavy and light internal particles , we have obtained the complete bare one - loop effective lagrangian , including operators up to dimension six .",
    "it contains several operators with infinite coefficients ( dimensional continuation was employed to regularize all divergent integrals , then uv divergences appear as poles in @xmath272 ) . by using an @xmath162 scheme to renormalize both the full and the effective theories",
    ", we obtained the matching conditions for the running couplings , which express the renormalized couplings of the effective theory in terms of the renormalized couplings of the full model . to avoid large logarithms ,",
    "these matching conditions should be evaluated at a scale around the heavy scalar mass and then the renormalization group used to bring the couplings to any other lower scale .",
    "we used this simple example to discuss the behaviour of the couplings of a generic effective lagrangian .",
    "in general all the operators in the effective lagrangian with the same quantum numbers mix under the renormalization group .",
    "the effective couplings obey a standard renormalization group first - order differential equation controlled by the anomalous - dimension matrix .",
    "it is clear that the only information that can be extracted from the effective lagrangian , without knowing the full theory , is this anomalous - dimension matrix .",
    "however , to obtain the couplings it is necessary to solve the renormalization group equations , and this requires the knowledge of @xmath273 boundary conditions ( if @xmath273-operators are involved in the mixing ) .",
    "one - loop calculations with the effective lagrangian can only be used to relate the couplings of operators at different scales , but give no information at all on the actual value of those couplings . only experiment , or a more complete theory , can give new information on the values of the effective lagrangian couplings .",
    "this trivial observation is of importance when using the effective lagrangian approach to classify the sort of new physics one could find in future experiments .",
    "after renormalization we obtain an effective lagrangian that can be split in three pieces . the first one , @xmath39 , is just the standard model lagrangian ( expressed in terms of effective couplings ) ; the second one is the four - lepton interaction obtained from the full theory at tree level , @xmath158 ; the third piece , @xmath252 contains all dimension - six operators generated at the one - loop level in the full model .",
    "this effective lagrangian was rewritten by using the standard model classical equations of motion in order to display its physical content more transparently .",
    "some caution is needed when using the equations of motion , especially for operators that are going to be inserted in loop diagrams . in our case , however , the equations of motion are used only in operators that are generated at one loop in the full theory and that are supposed to be used only at tree level in the effective lagrangian . then , the use of equations of motion is completely legitimate .",
    "we used them for the unbroken theory , but it is worth while to stress that the equations of motion might also be used after ssb ( or might not be used at all ) and this would not change any physical result .",
    "we also discussed the consequences of ssb on our effective lagrangian by substituting the vev of the doublet and neglecting all higgs interactions .",
    "apart from a negligible modification of the relation between the masses of the vector bosons , the most interesting consequence of the model is due to the different operators contributing to processes with violation of the generational lepton numbers .",
    "we made a short review of some processes generated by our one - loop effective lagrangian , @xmath274 , @xmath275 , etc ( where @xmath276 are different flavour indices ) .",
    "a more detailed phenomenological analysis will be presented elsewhere .    finally , to see how one can use our effective lagrangian ,",
    "we have calculated the decay width of the @xmath0 gauge boson to a pair of different leptons .",
    "it contains contributions from one - loop diagrams with one insertion of the tree - level four - fermion operator and direct contributions from operators generated at the one - loop level .",
