    "the magnetic properties of the high @xmath9 superconductors ( htcs ) have attracted much interest also because these compounds are experimental realizations of a 2d heisenberg antiferromagnet.@xcite in undoped la@xmath10cuo@xmath2 the cu@xmath11 spins order into a 3d antiferromagnetic ( af ) state below @xmath12k with the staggered magnetization in the @xmath13 plane.@xcite when doping by substituting sr for la , the long range af order is rapidly suppressed and around @xmath14 the nel temperature drops to 0  k. in the long range af region @xmath15 follows a power law relationship with @xmath16 , interpreted as an indication that the holes introduced by doping form walls separating domains of undoped material.@xcite later work indicated that the spin degrees of freedom associated with the doped holes are distinct from the in - plane cu@xmath17 spin degrees of freedom that order themselves below @xmath18 , and the localization of the doped holes allows the associated spins to progressively slow down and freeze.@xcite the state in which the doped spins freeze is usually referred to as a spin glass ( sg ) state , and occurs below @xmath19 . for @xmath20",
    "there is no long range af order , but approaching @xmath21  k@xmath22 af correlations develop within domains separated by charge walls , with the easy axes of the staggered magnetization uncorrelated between different clusters .",
    "this picture corresponds to a cluster spin - glass ( csg ) state .",
    "the formation of the sg and csg states are inferred from sharp maxima in the @xmath23la nqr@xcite and @xmath24sr@xcite relaxation rates , which indicate the slowing of the af fluctuations below the measuring frequency ( @xmath25  hz in those experiments ) , and from the observation of irreversibility , remnant magnetization , and scaling behavior in magnetic susceptibility experiments.@xcite also anelastic spectroscopy can provide useful information about the magnetic properties of high htcs . above @xmath26 , the elastic energy loss coefficient shows a rise below a temperature @xmath27 close to the @xmath28 for freezing into the csg state.@xcite the absorption is not peaked near @xmath29 , but is step - like or at least displays a plateau , and therefore does not directly correspond to the peak in the dynamic spin susceptibility due to the spin freezing ; rather , it has been attributed to the stress - induced changes of the sizes of the spin clusters , or equivalently to the motion of the domain walls.@xcite    recently , matsuda _ et al .",
    "_ reported a neutron scattering study of the magnetic correlations in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 for @xmath30 , which suggests a different picture of the spin glass phase.@xcite in fact , they found that also at @xmath30 the 3d af ordered phase coexists below @xmath31 k with domains of  diagonal  stripe phase ( with the hole stripes at @xmath32 with respect to the cu - o bonds ) , as observed for @xmath20 . according to these authors ,",
    "the hole localization starting around 150  k involves an electronic phase separation into regions with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the volume fraction of the @xmath35 phase changes as a function of the sr doping , in order to achieve the average @xmath16 .    in the following",
    "we will report on anelastic spectroscopy measurements of lightly doped la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , where the anelastic spectra for @xmath36 present the same features attributed to the domain wall motion into the csg phase , although attenuated .",
    "the step - like rise of dissipation occurs near 10  k , as for @xmath37 , supporting the view of an electronic phase separation , at least for @xmath38 .",
    "the samples where prepared by standard solid state reaction as described in ref .   and cut in bars approximately @xmath39  mm@xmath40 . in the as - sintered state",
    "all the samples contained small amounts of interstitial o , which was outgassed by heating in vacuum up to @xmath41k .",
    "the complex young s modulus @xmath42 , whose reciprocal is the elastic compliance @xmath43 , was measured as a function of temperature by electrostatically exciting the flexural modes .",
    "the vibration amplitude was detected by a frequency modulation technique .",
    "the vibration frequency , @xmath44 , is proportional to @xmath45 , while the elastic energy loss coefficient ( or reciprocal of the mechanical @xmath46 ) is given by@xcite @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 , and was measured by the decay of the free oscillations or the width of the resonance peak .",
    "the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility @xmath50 is related to the spectral density @xmath51 @xmath52 of the macroscopic strain @xmath53 through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , @xmath54 @xmath55 .",
    "magnetoelastic coupling can couple strain to the spin degrees of freedom , so that pseudodiffusive spin excitations ( with null characteristic frequency ) or the motion of magnetic boundaries can contribute to @xmath56 .",
    "an elementary relaxation process with a thermally activated relaxation time @xmath57 contributes with @xmath54 @xmath58 $ ] , peaked at the temperature at which @xmath59 ( which therefore increases with increasing @xmath60 ) , while the relaxation of extended and interacting structures like domain walls generally gives rise to a broader dissipation curve .",
    "the nominal compositions of the samples were : @xmath61 @xmath62 , 0.016 , 0.018 , 0.024 and 0.030 .",
    "the final sr contents were checked from the temperature position of the step in the young s modulus @xmath63 due to the tetragonal ( htt ) / orthorhombic ( lto ) transition , which occurs at a temperature @xmath64 decreasing with doping approximately as @xmath65  k ( ref .  ) .",
    "the shape of the anomaly in @xmath63 can not be completely fitted by a simple model , since it includes both contributions from the coupling of the spontaneous strain with the soft mode@xcite and from the domain wall motion,@xcite but its position in temperature provides information about the level of doping . figure 1 presents the logarithmic derivative of the young s modulus with respect to temperature , @xmath66 /dt$ ] , so that the steps become peaks whose widths provide upper limits to the spread of the local sr concentration ; the peaks are fitted with lorentzians .",
    "the sr concentrations estimated from the peak positions and from @xmath64 are @xmath67 , 0.0155 , 0.0183 , 0.0227 and 0.0273 respectively ; the sample with @xmath68 results to be less doped than the one with @xmath69 and with a broader transition .",
    "there is considerable overlapping of the peaks of the samples with @xmath70 , but this should not be simply interpreted as a distribution of local @xmath16 spanning 0.015 - 0.018 for all these samples .",
    "in fact , the peaks in the derivative of @xmath71 can not be interpreted as the distribution function of the local @xmath16 after the @xmath72 scale is converted into an @xmath16 scale inverting @xmath73 , since the step of @xmath71 has an intrinsic width due to the progressive phonon softening above @xmath74 and to the relaxational character of the domain wall motion below @xmath74 .",
    "the undoped samples , for example , certainly do not have a spread of sr concentration , but the widths of their lorentzians ( not shown here ) are @xmath75  k , compared to 10  k of the sample with @xmath68 . in the following we will refer to the doping level obtained from the position of the step in the young s modulus .",
    "figure 2 presents the anelastic spectra of the five samples measured exciting the first flexural mode , around 1  khz .",
    "the sharp rise of dissipation at the lowest temperatures is the tail of an intense peak attributed to the tunneling - driven tilt motion of a fraction of the o octahedra.@xcite the shift of the peak to lower temperature with increasing doping would be due to a direct coupling between the hole excitations and the tunneling - driven local tilts of the o  octahedra :  the more the hole excitations and the faster the local tilting.@xcite we are concerned with the steplike feature at @xmath76 for @xmath77 , and below @xmath78  k for @xmath79 . that such a dissipation rise occurs at @xmath29 and is steplike or at least consists of a plateau rather than a peak is particularly evident at higher doping , when the influence of the tail of the peak at lower temperature is less important;@xcite here only two curves with @xmath80 are presented .",
    "the dissipation rise has been attributed to the stress - induced movement of the boundaries between the clusters of quasi - frozen antiferromagnetically correlated spins which form the csg phase.@xcite the main result is that also the samples with @xmath79 present a similar feature around 10  k. with lowering @xmath16 below 0.02 , the position of the dissipation step remains unchanged , while its intensity decreases ; this is more difficult to see for the sample with @xmath81 , since the tail of the low temperature peak is shifted to higher temperature ( consistent with the lowest doping in spite of the nominal @xmath16 ) .",
    "considering also previous data@xcite , it appears that , starting from high doping and lowering it , the dissipation step first rises in temperature according to @xmath82 and increases in intensity down to @xmath37 ; below that doping its temperature remains unchanged and the intensity decreases .",
    "one would expect that the dissipation rise near 10  k for @xmath79 corresponds to the peak in the spin susceptibility occurring when the magnetic fluctuations slow down below the measuring frequency during the freezing process into the sg phase , as in the nqr measurements;@xcite also the temperature region would be as expected , since , according to the generally accepted phase diagram,@xcite at @xmath83 both @xmath84 and @xmath82 merge at @xmath85  k. _  _ however , there are two features signalling the different nature of the absorption rise below @xmath86  k : one is the shape , certainly different from the sharp peak of the nqr relaxation rate , and the other is the total absence of the expected linear shift toward lower temperature when the doping is reduced .",
    "this is better demonstrated by the derivatives of the @xmath87 curves in fig .",
    "3 , where the negative peaks at high temperature , labelled with the estimated doping values , correspond to the steps in @xmath88 . the three peaks with @xmath79 even shift to higher temperature with decreasing @xmath16 ,",
    "although the effect is very small and most likely attributable to the increasing influence of the tail of the peak at lower temperature . instead ,",
    "according to the generally adopted phase diagram with @xmath89 the three peaks should display an overall shift by 2.3  k in the opposite direction ; it is therefore clear from fig .",
    "3 that there is no relation between the acoustic dissipation step and @xmath90 .",
    "the spectra of the samples with @xmath79 strictly resemble those for @xmath77 , and the latter have been successfully interpreted in terms of onset below @xmath91 of the motion of the domain walls between different spin clusters in the csg phase .",
    "the decrease of the amplitude @xmath92 of the absorption step above @xmath93 has been semiquantitatively explained considering a simple model of the csg phase , with the sr atoms acting as pinning points for the domain walls , which coincide with the hole stripes.@xcite the relaxation strength is expected to be of the form @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the volume concentration of the domain walls , @xmath96 is the distance between pinning points , and @xmath97 turns out @xmath98 , intermediate between the case of the motion of dislocations and of walls between ferromagnetic domains.@xcite it was also possible to observe the pinning of the walls by the low - temperature tetragonal lattice modulation in samples doped with ba instead of sr.@xcite the mechanism of dissipative motion of the domain walls is well known for ferromagnetic materials,@xcite and is possible also for an af state , if an anisotropic strain is coupled with the easy magnetization axis . in this case , the elastic energy of domains with different orientations of the staggered magnetization are differently affected by a shear stress , and the lower energy domains grow at the expenses of the higher energy ones providing the coupling between strain and domain wall motion .",
    "the same mechanism could not be applied to the sg state , even admitting the existence of hole stripes below 10  k , since they would move into a uniform long - range ordered af matrix , instead of separating inequivalent domains , and other more subtle mechanisms should be invoked .",
    "it has to be concluded that the anelastic spectra for @xmath79 ( fig .",
    "2a ) can not be justified in terms of the spin - glass phase with @xmath99 increasing linearly with @xmath16 ; rather , they can be explained in a straightforward way within the physical picture derived from the inelastic neutron scattering measurements.@xcite according to these observations , there is an electronic phase separation below @xmath93 , where domains with fixed @xmath35 coexist with regions of undoped material with @xmath100 .",
    "such domains have sizes estimated in several hundreds of   within the cuo@xmath101 planes , and display the same  diagonal stripe  correlations which are observed in the csg state for @xmath80 .",
    "the volume fraction of these domains has also been verified to increase linearly with @xmath16 , as expected . in this phase separation picture",
    ", the elastic energy dissipation curves for @xmath79 simply contain the step - like increase due to the motion of the hole stripes within the @xmath102 domains , whose sizes are sufficiently large that they appear as the homogeneous phase @xmath103 with the same @xmath104  k. the reduced volume fraction at lower doping simply results in a reduced amplitude of the elastic energy absorption .    the fact that the temperature at which our measurements reveal the presence of spin domains is much lower than the temperature of 30  k reported by matsuda _",
    "et al._@xcite also agrees with what is observed in the csg state.@xcite in fact , the onset temperature for freezing toward the glass state , @xmath27 , depends on the time scale at which the experimental technique probes the system , and decreases as the angular frequency @xmath60 of the probe decreases . in neutron scattering experiments",
    "@xmath60 is of the order of @xmath105  s@xmath106 , whilst for the anelastic spectroscopy @xmath107  s@xmath106 , resulting in a factor 2.5 between the two @xmath27 for at @xmath108;@xcite this is consistent with the @xmath27 @xmath109  k deduced from the curves of fig .",
    "the dissipation curves of fig .",
    "2a clearly indicate that the same dissipation mechanism of the csg phase is operative also at @xmath79 , and therefore are in good agreement with the phase separation picture from the neutron scattering experiment;@xcite however , these curves alone are not sufficient for clearly discriminating between a neat phase separation into @xmath110 and @xmath111 or a situation with a smooth transition from the csg to the sg state over a wide concentration range around 0.02 . for example , according to the theoretical model proposed by gooding _",
    "et al.,_@xcite at low temperature the holes localize near the sr dopants and circulate over the four cu atoms neighbors to sr , inducing a distortion of the surrounding cu spins , otherwise aligned according to the prevalent af order parameter .",
    "the spin texture arising from the frustrated combination of the spin distortions from the various localized holes produces domains with differently oriented af order parameters , which can be identified with the frozen af spin clusters . in this model",
    "there is no clear boundary between the sg and csg state , and the present data could also fit into such a description .",
    "the possibility has also to be considered that the discrepancy between the present results below @xmath37 and the canonical phase diagram is due to inhomogeneous doping of the samples at a microscopic level .",
    "errors in evaluating the actual doping and inhomogeneous doping would produce particularly large shifts and uncertainty in the determination of @xmath112 and @xmath29 , since these temperatures appear to merge around the value @xmath113  k at @xmath114 , where they strongly depend on doping .",
    "indeed , there is a wide scattering of experimental data in that region of the phase diagram,@xcite which can be due to uncertainties in @xmath16 , but also to the fact that the transition between sg and csg is not as sharp as supposed .",
    "the present data support the second explanation .",
    "in fact , we can not exclude the possibility of inhomogeneous doping of our samples with certainty , only based on the width of the htt / lto phase transition , because we are not able to carry out a rigorous analysis of the curves of fig . 1 .",
    "still , we note that if the high temperature of the step of samples with average @xmath79 is due to regions with @xmath77 , then we should expect a similar spread of the local doping also for the samples with @xmath77 , since all the samples have been prepared in the same way .",
    "then , the sample with @xmath115 should exhibit a partial onset of dissipation already above 10  k , due to regions with @xmath37 . the sample with @xmath116 , instead , displays a neat rise below 8  k , excluding the presence of regions with @xmath117 .",
    "it can be concluded that the present measurements demonstrate the presence of csg domains also for @xmath79 , and the insensitivity of the temperature of the acoustic anomaly on doping supports the proposal@xcite of an intrinsic phase separation at @xmath79_. _",
    "we measured the anelastic spectra of la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2  for both @xmath118  and @xmath77 , spanning the region of the phase diagram where the transition from the sg to the csg phase is expected . the same step - like feature in the elastic energy loss function that has been attributed to the domain wall motion in the csg state is also found for @xmath38 .",
    "the step can not be related to the sg phase whose onset is usually assumed to be @xmath119 , since its temperature remains locked at the value found for @xmath93 .",
    "the present data clearly show that csg regions exist also for @xmath118 and therefore there is no neat separation between the sg and csg regions .",
    "they can be naturally interpreted in the framework of the phase separation model for @xmath79 , recently proposed by matsuda _",
