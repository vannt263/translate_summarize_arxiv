    "in @xcite an epidemic - affected one species metapopulation model with fixed size and immigrations depending inversely on the crowding of the arrival environment has been introduced , along lines that allow disease consideration in fragmented habitats , @xcite . here ,",
    "we add reproduction capabilities and specialize the system to two particular cases , when the migrations can occur only in one direction , or when infected are too weak to undertake any migrating effort .",
    "assume it is not possible to return to patch 1 from the second one .",
    "the system is pictured in figure [ fig : graf_interr_migr_2_1 ] left .",
    "the model reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 represent the net reproduction rates of the population in each environment , which is assumed to have different ecological characteristics .",
    "the other parameters have the following meanings @xmath3 is the infected mortality rate in each patch , @xmath4 the disease contact rate , @xmath5 is the disease recovery rate , @xmath6 is the half saturation constant for the susceptibles , and @xmath7 the one for the infected ; finally the migration rates from patch @xmath8 into patch @xmath9 are @xmath10 for the susceptibles and @xmath11 for the infected .",
    "the equilibria are the origin , trivially , possibly the coexistence in both patches with an endemic disease , and the point with only the arrival patch populated by both susceptibles and infected , @xmath12 , @xmath13 which is clearly unconditionally feasible , and the point @xmath14 , with the first patch disease - free , @xmath15 @xmath16 this equilibrium is feasible for @xmath17 \\ge ( \\delta_2+\\mu_2)r_1r_2.\\ ] ]    for the equilibrium with both patches populated and with endemic disease , let us sum the first and third equations of ( [ model_1 ] ) as well as the second and fourth one , to obtain @xmath18 adding these equations further and solving for @xmath19 as function of @xmath20 we substitute it into the second one of ( [ eq2piu4 ] ) to get @xmath21 necessary conditions for the feasibility of this equilibrium are either one of the following two sets of inequalities @xmath22 @xmath23 but we need also to ensure that @xmath24 , so that finally we also get either one of the inequalities @xmath25    the jacobian of ( [ model_1 ] ) is @xmath26\\ ] ] where @xmath27    the origin is unstable , since the eigenvalues are @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",

    "the points @xmath32 , @xmath37 and coexistence can stably be achieved respectively by the following parameter choices @xmath44",
    "in this case the model with @xmath45 is shown in figure [ fig : graf_interr_migr_2_1 ] right and reads @xmath46    in addition to the origin and ecosystem survival with the endemic disease in both patches , we find two more points @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 solve the equations @xmath50 the first is an intersection problem of the curves @xmath51 , @xmath52 , with @xmath53 the parabola @xmath54 has roots @xmath55(2a_2 \\gamma_1)^{-2}$ ] and an intersection for @xmath56 is possible only for @xmath57 . but the existence of the intersection is not ensured , since the cubic has positive coefficient , @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "similar remarks hold for the point @xmath60 .",

    "the generic equilibria share common properties in both models .",
    "namely , instability of the origin means ecosystem permanence .",
    "the systems allow also survival of the population in both patches , with endemic disease .    within the unidirectional migration model ,",
    "the patch from which migrations occur could become completely depleted , or else it may be populated , but disease - free . as these are mutually exclusive equilibria , it is possible that bistability phenomena arise as for @xcite .",
    "the basins of attraction of the equilibria could be determined using the algorithms being developed , @xcite .",
    "for the model in which infected do not migrate , specific equilibria are the situations in which either patch becomes epidemic - free .",
    "these considerations could be very useful in practical situations for disease eradication in some environments .",
