    "for forty years quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has served as one of the pillars of the standard model .",
    "early doubts about the existence of quarks were dispelled by the discovery of the @xmath3 , while  following a suggestion due to ellis , gaillard , and ross  gluons were confirmed by the discovery of three jet events at desy in 1979@xcite .",
    "although gluons are now firmly established as the carriers of the strong force , their nonperturbative behavior remains enigmatic .",
    "this unfortunate circumstance is chiefly due to two features of qcd : the theory is notoriously difficult to work with in the nonperturbative regime , and experimental manifestations of glue tend to be hidden in the spectrum and dynamics of hadrons .",
    "hadrons that carry valence quark and gluonic degrees of freedom are one such experimental manifestation that has been postulated since the early days of qcd@xcite .",
    "these states are called _ hybrids _ and a review of their experimental and theoretical status is the purpose of this article .    that discovering explicit nonperturbative glue is difficult can be gleaned from the history of the development the quark model and qcd .",
    "all the well - established mesons have @xmath4 equal to @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , etc , which can be created with fermion - antifermion pairs in an given orbital momentum state .",
    "this strongly suggests that quarks are spin-1/2 , while the spectrum ordering suggests that energy increases with orbital angular momentum .",
    "furthermore , the absence of mesons with isospin or strangeness greater than unity supports the idea that mesons are fermion - antifermion states .",
    "thus the simple quark model of mesons ( and baryons ) was partly motivated by the _ absence _ of  exotic \" hadrons such as multiquark or gluonic states .",
    "it is thus perhaps no surprise that qcd exotics have been difficult to observe .",
    "the simplest explanation for this observation is that gluonic degrees of freedom are somewhat  stiff \" and therefore difficult to excite . of course",
    ", with the increasing energy , luminosity , and capabilities of modern accelerators and detectors one might hope that this regime can be explored .",
    "the interesting question then is : can an analogous spectroscopy of glue be discerned in the data ?",
    "a basic question that the data and its interpretation must address is what is meant by the notion of valence glue . as an example of the importance of choosing correct degrees of freedom , we mention the simple problem of determining the number of components of a constituent gluon .",
    "for example , one might suppose that a massive constituent gluon ( of mass @xmath8 ) should be transverse so as to maintain consistency with yang s theorem .",
    "however , this is inconsistent with the requirements of lorentz invariance .",
    "thus , for example , @xmath9 glueballs are expected to exist and lattice calculations indicate that they are quite heavy ( roughly 3 gev)@xcite .",
    "such a state may not be constructed from two transverse constituent gluons ( due to yang s theorem ) and therefore may be expected to have a mass of roughly @xmath10 .",
    "however massive vector gluons have no such constraint and one therefore expects them to have a mass of approximately @xmath11 .",
    "clearly the assumed active degrees of freedom play a large role in determining the gross features of the spectrum .",
    "there are two broad ideas concerning soft glue : it is some sort of string or flux tube or it is an effective constituent confined by a bag or potential . in different language ,",
    "nonperturbative glue can be thought of as collective , nonlocal degrees of freedom , or as a local quasiparticle degree of freedom . lattice gauge theory and experiment",
    "are the two main methods which permit resolving this longstanding issue .",
    "of course the primary task is to experimentally verify that such excitations of qcd exist .",
    "then a thorough investigation of the hybrid spectrum and its production and decay mechanisms must ensue ; this must be compared to lattice gauge and model computations , and a qualitative picture must be built before we can claim to fully understand the enigmatic gluonic sector of the standard model .",
    "we will start with a review of properties of hybrids and related gluonic systems as determined by lattice gauge computations .",
    "this will serve to set terminology and establish a base to which models can be compared .",
    "this is followed by brief summaries of the ideas and main results in string - based models , bag models , and constituent glue models .",
    "we then summarize the current status of the experimental search for hybrid mesons .",
    "finally , future experimental prospects and an outlook on what is required and expected from theory is presented .    before starting",
    ", it will be useful to note that valence gluonic degrees of freedom increase the quantum numbers that are available to fermion - antifermion systems .",
    "the parity and charge conjugation that are available to @xmath12 systems are specified by @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the @xmath12 total angular momentum and spin .",
    "this means that @xmath17 , odd@xmath18 , and even@xmath19 are not available to simple quark - antiquark systems .",
    "hadrons with these quantum numbers are called ",
    "( quantum number ) exotic \" .",
    "a variety of notations have developed over the years for hybrids .",
    "terminology appears to have settled on using standard pdg notation to describe the flavor of a hybrid , a subscript to denote the total spin , with parity and charge conjugation following that of the named hadron .",
    "thus , for example , a @xmath20 isovector hybrid would be denoted @xmath21 .",
    "the use of a lattice regulator for euclidean field theories permits the numerical evaluation of path integrals .",
    "thus all correlation functions can , in principle , be computed under controlled approximations .",
    "historically , this brilliant promise has been compromised by various technical issues including large quark masses , the difficulty in computing  hairpin \" fermion lines , difficulty in computing the excited spectrum , and most prominently , difficulty in computing the determinant of the dirac operator .",
    "the latter issue was handled by ignoring it ( this is called the  quenched approximation \" ; it is , in fact , not an approximation , but a truncation that renders a quantum field theory inconsistent ) .",
    "the root problem of all of these issues is that they introduce excessive noise into observables  however , to some extent all of them have been overcome in the past decade .",
    "thus modern lattice computations are made on large lattices , are not quenched ( they include the effects of virtual quarks ) , incorporate large bases of interpolating fields ( which permits the extraction of excited states ) , and employ sophisticated stochastic methods to compute hairpin fermion propagators .",
    "the remaining issues are chiefly quark masses that tend to be too large and the necessity of incorporating continuum interpolating operators . both of these are rapidly becoming things of the past .",
    "lattice investigations of soft gluonic matter date to an investigation of the adiabatic gluonic spectrum by griffiths , michael , and rakow @xcite .",
    "the idea is that gluons are a",
    " fast \" degree of freedom with respect to heavy quarks . in the static limit",
    "the quark and antiquark serve as a color source and sink at a distance @xmath22 and the gluonic field arranges itself into configurations described by various quantum numbers .",
    "these quantum numbers match those of diatomic molecules : the projection of the gluonic angular momentum onto the @xmath12 axis ( denoted @xmath23 ) , the product of gluonic parity and charge conjugation @xmath24 , and @xmath25-parity , which represents the reflection of the system through a plane containing the @xmath12 axis .",
    "the notation    @xmath26 will be used in the following , where @xmath27 is denoted @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ; @xmath32 is labelled @xmath33 ( negative ) or @xmath34 ( positive ) ; and @xmath35 . for @xmath36",
    "the two @xmath25-parity eigenstates are degenerate and the @xmath25 quantum number is not given .",
    "griffiths _ et al .",
    "_ sought to compute the adiabatic configuration energies , @xmath37 as a function of the distance between the color source and sink .",
    "this computation was made in su(2 ) quenched gauge theory on an @xmath38 lattice and rough results for the lowest two surfaces were obtained .",
    "subsequent work was carried out by the ukqcd collaboration @xcite and juge , kuti , and morningstar@xcite .",
    "et al . _ performed a large scale computation with many basis states and were able to obtain many excited states out to large distance .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ vrplot ] ; here @xmath39 is approximately 0.5 fm and the potentials have been renormalized by subtracting the value of @xmath40 at @xmath39",
    ".    an interesting feature of the spectrum is that the adiabatic surfaces tend to finite values at small interquark separation .",
    "this may be a surprise because the expected perturbative behavior at small @xmath22 for a pair of quarks in a color octet is    @xmath41    alternatively , quarks in a color singlet should have an energy    @xmath42 at very small distances .",
    "the figure shows that this distance scale is evidently smaller than 0.1 fm .",
    "the actual behavior of the adiabatic potentials at small distance is problematic : lattice gauge computations diverge at the origin and must be regulated in some way .",
    "furthermore , level crossing is expected to occur ; namely , it will become energetically favorable for a configuration to emit a scalar glueball and convert to a @xmath12 color singlet state at some distance .",
    "this surface and the level crossings are indicated by the dashed line in the figure . of course the quantum numbers must agree for the transition to occur and",
    "the mixing matrix element must be large enough to resolve it at the temporal extent used in the lattice computation .",
    "the large distance behavior of the adiabatic surfaces is of interest because it is widely held that this behavior is governed by string dynamics@xcite .",
    "the simplest geometric string model is described by the nambu - goto action    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is a massless vector field with two transverse components . in @xmath45 dimensions",
    "this gives rise to a spectrum ( computed with fixed ends ) of@xcite ( the string tension is denoted @xmath46 ) is required for consistent quantization , but this problem is not relevant for large @xmath22 . ]",
    "@xmath47    the fact that this formula works quite well for the ground state surface for @xmath48 fm has been traditionally taken as an indication for the robustness of the string description of gluodynamics@xcite .    at large distances",
    "the nambu - goto action predicts splittings between adiabatic surfaces that behave as @xmath49",
    ". detailed comparison to large distance lattice results by juge _",
    "_ reveal that the expected universal behavior is achieved , but only for quark separations greater than 2 fm ; furthermore residual deviations from string behavior indicate the presence of fine structure in the interaction , so that an effective string interaction is more appropriate for the description of gluonic excitations at large distances@xcite .",
    "a  gluelump \" is a hadronic state comprised of a static source in the octet representation with accompanying glue , such that the resulting state is a singlet under gauge transformations .",
    "investigation of gluelumps was motivated by interest in the properties of bound states of massive gluinos and gluons@xcite .",
    "the initial lattice investigation was made by michael in 1985 in quenched su(2 ) gauge theory@xcite .",
    "we note that the gluelump spectrum can be determined up to an infinite self energy due to the static adjoint gluon . thus",
    "energy differences can be unambiguously extracted .",
    "absolute energies can also be obtained under specified renormalization schemes . here",
    "we present the results of bali and pineda@xcite , which were obtained in quenched su(3 ) gauge theory .",
    "absolute gluelump energies were obtained by employing a renormalon subtraction scheme@xcite with a matching scale set to @xmath50 gev .",
    "results for the lowest lying eight levels are shown in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the authors of ref . @xcite have examined a large set of quantum numbers and non - octet sources , with results similar to those presented here .",
    ".low lying gluelump spectrum@xcite . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      with so little experimental evidence for this high - mass state , it is difficult to say much .",
    "we note that the observed decays , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are those expected for a hybrid meson .",
    "we also note that the production of this state is consistent ( natural parity exchange ) for both of the observed final states . in the case",
    "that the @xmath54 is associated with the lowest - mass hybrid state , one possible interpretation of the @xmath51 would be an excited state ( as suggested by recent lqcd calculations  @xcite ) .",
    "the mass splitting is typical of radial excitations observed in the normal mesons . in the case that the @xmath54 is identified as something else , the @xmath51 would be a prime candidate for the lightest mass hybrid .",
    "hybrid mesons should be observed in nonets , and lattice qcd has recently made quite clear predictions that several of these nonets should have exotic quantum numbers .",
    "the lightest supermultiplet of hybrids , @xmath55 , contains one exotic quantum number nonet ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "excitations of these should contain another @xmath56 nonet , in addition to a single spin-0 ( @xmath57 ) and two spin-2 ( @xmath58 ) nonets .",
    "experimentally , we have seen evidence for up to three isospin-1 , spin-1 exotic states : @xmath59 , @xmath54 and @xmath60 .",
    "as we noted it seems unlikely that the lightest of these is a hybrid , while the heavier two states could map onto the isospin-1 members of the two @xmath56 nonets predicted by lattice qcd .",
    "unfortunately , lacking experimental evidence for other members of these nonets , it is difficult to draw solid conclusions .",
    "in particular , observation of one or both isospin-0 members of either nonet is needed . beyond the spin-1 exotic hybrids ,",
    "observation of states with quantum numbers @xmath58 and or @xmath57 is needed .",
    "as we move forward over the next several years , new experimental efforts will join compass in searching for these states . at jefferson lab",
    ", the gluex experiment expects to take first physics data in late 2015 .",
    "gluex will use linearly polarized photons incident on a hydrogen target to produce these states . in the next five years or so ,",
    "panda at fair will join these efforts with antiproton beams  hopefully dramatically new information will be gleaned from these experimental efforts .",
    "keeping pace with experiment will require a number improvements in theory .",
    "it is hoped , for example , that lattice gauge theory will be able to provide predictions for light and charmonium hybrid masses on unquenched lattices with physical pion masses and multihadron operators relatively soon .",
    "conclusive and comprehensive computations of strong and electromagnetic transitions of light and charmonium hybrids would also be most welcome .    a new breed of models that is capable of reproducing central lattice results is also required .",
    "ideally these models will reproduce the gluonic adiabatic potentials and the spectrum of heavy and light hybrids reasonably well .",
    "presumably this will require a formalism that captures short range and long range dynamics in an approximate fashion without double counting or other conceptual issues .",
    "perhaps a promising approach would be a model based on coulomb gauge qcd with a variable number of constituent gluons and many - body interactions .",
    "such a model should also be able to describe strong and electromagnetic decays reasonably accurately .",
    "these are demanding criteria , but new experimental and lattice data should provide many valuable clues , which will hopefully lead to a quantitative and qualitative understanding of this enigmatic sector of the standard model .",
    "the authors would like to thank many people for useful discussions , especially j.  j.  dudek and c.  j.  morningstar .",
