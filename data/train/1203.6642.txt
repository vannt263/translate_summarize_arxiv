    "data from particle colliders may reveal new states of matter or evidence for new forms of interactions , or disprove theories of such new phenomena .",
    "when no evidence of new phenomena is seen , the experimental collaborations who collect and analyze the data communicate the non - observation in terms of statistical limits on theories which predict the new states or interactions .",
    "the space of possible theoretical models is impossibly vast ; therefore experimental results are typically communicated as limits on a few benchmark models of particular or historical interest .",
    "however , the data can provide tight constraints on many other models not included in the experimental analysis  such as models not yet constructed .",
    "one solution would be for the experiments to provide a rapid mechanism for testing new models against previously analyzed datasets .",
    "currently , however , the experiments are not capable of ( or perhaps not interested in ) responding to an exhaustive list of models ; furthermore , experimental re - analysis typically occurs on a timescale of weeks or months rather than hours or days .",
    "some ideas have been proposed to smoothen this process , such as recast  @xcite , which elegantly connects the individual experimental experts to the theoretical models , but does not remove the lengthy experimental review process and so does not provide a rapid and certain solution  the experiment may still choose to not provide limits on the requested models .    to date , it has been impossible for those outside the experimental collaborations to reinterpret the published results on benchmark models in order to set limits on new models , except in a single restrictive case .",
    "when experimental analysis is performed as a simple selection of events ( e.g.  @xcite ) , it can be imagined as a counting experiment and the information needed to derive limits on new models is often included in the experimental publication . to calculate a statistical upper limit on the number of events from a new source , @xmath5 , which is compatible with the data , all that is needed are the expected contributions from standard model ( sm ) backgrounds ( with uncertainties ) and the observed collider event yield .",
    "one can then calculate an upper limit on the production cross section of the new source , @xmath6 , using    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the efficiency of the experimental detection and selection and @xmath9 is the integrated luminosity of the dataset .",
    "reasonable methods exist for estimating @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "access to only single - bin analysis for reinterpretation is an unfortunately restrictive condition , as many of the most powerful and important results are those which perform a multi - bin fit to a spectrum , taking advantage of distinct signal and background shapes ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "use of a multi - bin histogram can greatly improve the sensitivity , but makes reinterpretation difficult , as one needs access to the bin - to - bin correlations for all background components and each of the systematic correlations  @xcite .",
    "multi - bin data may be reinterpreted directly in terms of new theoretical models but these rely on simple detector simulation tools which may not accurately describe the reconstructed variable .",
    "it is also difficult to describe all the systematic uncertainties , especially in a multi - bin analysis where a systematic uncertainty may also distort the shape of the template .",
    "such an approach is suited for comparing features in the data against specific new models  @xcite but can not be reliably used to to calculate realistic limits in the manner of the experimental collaborations .",
    "the result is that a large fraction of published results are unusable for reinterpretation",
    ".    a solution to this problem would be experimental publication of all the details of the limit calculation , for example the complete likelihood used to analyze the final binned data .",
    "this is not currently provided by the experiments , though there are prospects for future mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "we present a novel solution to this problem , which allows for the reinterpretation of published limits derived from multi - bin analysis .",
    "if the binned distribution of a new theoretical model can be expressed as a linear combination of the models for which published limits exist , a simple relationship allows the calculation of the limit on the new model as a simple combination of the limits on the published models .",
    "this allows a large swath of previously un - usable experimental results to confront a nearly arbitrary space of possible models without involvement by the experiment .    in the following ,",
    "we introduce `` the basis - limit hypothesis '' , demonstrate its effectiveness in simple artificial scenarios , show self - consistency by using published results to reproduce other published results on the same spectrum , and provide a reinterpretation of a search for chiral down - type heavy quarks ( @xmath0 ) in terms of a search for an exotic heavy quark ( @xmath1 ) with similar but distinct phenomenology .",
    "for a specific experimental dataset and background model which is analyzed using a binned likelihood in a variable @xmath10 , there are a set of @xmath11 signal hypotheses described by binned distributions ( `` templates '' ) @xmath12 . in the case",
    "that the data prefer the background model , each signal template has an associated cross - section upper limit , which can be expressed relative to the theoretical prediction for that signal hypothesis : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the cross section used to normalize the template @xmath15 , such that    @xmath16    and @xmath17 is the selection efficiency for the @xmath18-th signal hypothesis .    given a new , untested signal hypothesis template , @xmath19 , which may be expressed as a linear combination of @xmath20 , as    @xmath21    our hypothesis is that an upper limit on the cross - section of the new signal hypothesis , @xmath22 can be calculated from the limits ( @xmath13 ) associated with each @xmath20 , as @xmath23^{-1}\\ ] ]    stated briefly , given limits on a set of basis templates , we claim to be able to calculate limits on any new signal template which can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis templates .",
    "the idea is expressed diagrammatically in fig  [ fig : diag ] .",
    "we demonstrate the application of the basis - limit hypothesis using a simple toy scenario : a 3-bin analysis with two signal hypotheses , shown in figure  [ fig : f123 ] .",
    "the two signal templates are the basis templates and are generated with an arbitrary but equal signal cross - section , @xmath24 .",
    "( _ top _ ) , @xmath25 ( _ center _ ) and a linear combination @xmath26 .",

    "table  [ tab : example ] gives an example for a single case .",
    ".demonstration of basis - limit application in a toy scenario .",
    "a new signal hypothesis , @xmath27 , is formed from a linear combination of @xmath30 and @xmath25 using the coefficients @xmath31 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : f123 ] ) . the limits ( @xmath32 ) on the @xmath15 and the coefficients @xmath31 can be used to predict the limit on the new hypothesis , @xmath27 , using equation  [ eq : egl ] .",

    "the theoretical prediction is at approximate next - to - next - to - leading - order  @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "while the basis - limit hypothesis is an intuitive and effective construction , it is a heuristic formula .",
    "we do not provide its derivation from basic statistical axioms .    in some scenarios",
    ", it may fail to provide an accurate prediction of the limit on a new model , as mentioned above .",
    "indeed , we have observed some artificial scenarios in which the basis templates have very little overlap that a bias may occur in the prediction . some corrections may be calculable in this scenario , leading to modification of the @xmath31 coefficients based on the _ a priori _ overlap of the basis templates . in most cases , where the signal templates come from new physics processes with single slow - varying parameter , such as the mass of a new particle ,",
    "the templates have substantial overlap and the correction is negligible .    alternatively , we might express eq .",
    "[ eq : egl ] in another form , as @xmath34^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the bin content of the @xmath18-th bin for an @xmath11-bin analysis , and @xmath36 is an unknown constant which depends only on the background and data in the @xmath18-th bin . rather than expressing the new signal in terms of basis templates , we could solve for the @xmath36 given a set on @xmath11 limits on @xmath11 signal templates .",
    "this would allow the calculation of a limit on an arbitrary signal template without concern for an overlap correction as discussed above .",
    "we leave this for future investigation .",
    "the basis - limit hypothesis provides a tool for reinterpretting the results of experimental analysis using multi - bin data .",
    "previously , only single - bin analyses could be reinterpreted .",
    "some technical hurdles remain ; for example , if the published analysis uses a complex technique ( such as a multi - variate analysis tool ) and does not publish enough detail , then the selection can not be reproduced .",
    "this also applies to a single - bin analysis .",
    "superior solutions to the one we propose here are :    * archiving and streamlining by the experiments of published analysis , allowing for a rapid re - interpretation in terms of a new model .",
    "this has the disadvantage that it places the burden on the experiments . *",
    "publication by the experiments of all of the details necessary to reproduce the analysis .",
    "this has the disadvantage that it requires use of an approximate publicly - available simulation .    as neither of these",
    "are currently available , the basis - limit approach makes a wide range of results available for constraining current and future models .",
    "we use this approach to interpret an atlas search for @xmath37 to set the strongest limit on an exotic heavy quark @xmath1 which decays @xmath38 at @xmath2 gev at 95% confidence level .",
