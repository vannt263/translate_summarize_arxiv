    "the off - shell field content of @xmath2-dimensional super - yang ",
    "mills theory has an excess of seven fermionic degrees of freedom as compared to the number of gauge invariant bosonic degrees of freedom . to balance this mismatching ,",
    "it was proposed in @xcite to add to the supersymmetry transformation laws a set of seven auxiliary scalar fields @xmath3 , together with a @xmath4 term in the action . in order for the algebra to close off - shell",
    ", the parameters associated with the supersymmetry transformations must obey some identities .",
    "however , there is no linear solution to these identities , and thus no conventional supersymmetric formulation which permits the algebra to completely close .",
    "it has been demonstrated in @xcite that it is impossible to construct more than nine consistent solutions of these identities .",
    "thus , only nine supersymmetry generators can generate an algebra that closes off - shell .",
    "these nine supersymmetry generators in ten - dimensional super - yang  mills are related to the octonionic division algebra in the same manner that the supersymmetry generators in three- , four- , and six - dimensional super - yang  mills are related to the real , complex , and quaternionic division algebras .",
    "however , the non - associativity of octonions makes the ten - dimensional supersymmetry algebra more complicated than in the other dimensions .    on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath5 twisted @xmath6-dimensional super - yang  mills theory , which is a particular dimensional reduction of the @xmath2-dimensional theory , has been determined in @xcite by the invariance under a subalgebra of the maximal yang  mills supersymmetry .",
    "this subalgebra is small enough to close independently of equations of motion with a finite set of auxiliary fields , and yet is large enough to determine the yang ",
    "mills supersymmetric theory .",
    "it is also made of nine generators .",
    "the latter can be geometrically understood and constructed as scalar and vector topological yang  mills symmetries .",
    "this @xmath6-dimensional topological symmetry can be built independently of the notion of supersymmetry , but , surprisingly , the latter symmetry with 16 generators can be fully recovered at the end of the construction .    the aim of this paper is to make a bridge between the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we will find that in @xmath2-dimensional flat space with lorentz group @xmath7 reduced to @xmath8 , the supersymmetry algebra can be twisted such that the @xmath2-dimensional super - yang  mills theory is determined by a supersymmetry algebra with 9 generators , which is related by dimensional reduction to the twisted @xmath5 @xmath6-dimensional super - yang  mills theory .",
    "reciprocally , the extended curvature equation of the @xmath5 8-dimensional supersymmetric theory can be  oxidized \" into an analogous 10-dimensional equation that determines the supersymmetry algebra and @xmath2-dimensional super - yang  mills action .",
    "we argue that the largest symmetry group that can preserve an off - shell subalgebra of supersymmetry is @xmath8 , and we obtain the most general @xmath8 covariant solution of the identities defined in @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetry algebra that we derive is exactly the one obtained by the twist operation .",
    "we then define a superspace involving nine grassmann @xmath1 variables such that the off - shell supersymmetry subalgebra acts in a manifest way on the super - yang  mills superfields . using these off - shell superfields ,",
    "a superspace action is constructed which reproduces the ten - dimensional super - yang  mills action including the seven auxiliary scalar fields @xmath3 .",
    "although this superspace action is manifestly invariant under only a @xmath9 subgroup of @xmath10 , it is manifestly invariant under nine supersymmetries as well as gauge transformations .",
    "this can be compared with the light - cone superspace action for ten - dimensional super - yang ",
