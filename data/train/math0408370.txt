    "the cone field @xmath163 is therefore eventually strictly invariant , and this concludes the proof of lemma  [ ref2 ] .",

    "a broken segment @xmath307 is _ horizontal in @xmath306 _ if some component of @xmath308 connects the vertical sides of @xmath306 ; we have a dual definition of @xmath307 being _ vertical in @xmath306_. a simple geometric reasoning shows that if @xmath307 is horizontal in some @xmath306 , then @xmath309 $ ] is horizontal in all @xmath306 s , for every @xmath310 ( if at least one of @xmath311 is @xmath312 , then @xmath313 is sufficient ) .",

    "the length of @xmath316 $ ] goes to infinity as @xmath322 increases . since the twists @xmath119 and",
    "@xmath129 `` go in the same direction '' ( as in case  1 of  ( * ? ? ?",
