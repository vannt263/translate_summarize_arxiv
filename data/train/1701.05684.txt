    "various effective theoretical methods have been adopted , e.g. , exact diagonalization  @xcite , perturbation expansion@xcite , ultra - short life - time expansion  @xcite , dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite .    in x - ray scattering with",

    "in fact , excitations with 500 mev energy and characteristic momentum dependence were observed in the cu @xmath0-edge rixs for la@xmath3cuo@xmath4  @xcite , and have been identified as two - magnon excitations , based on the agreement with theoretical calculations  @xcite . in those previous theoretical works they adopted heisenberg spin hamiltonians and the spin - wave ( sw ) approximation .",

    "<S> we propose a new microscopic mechanism of two - magnon rixs , based on the hund s rule coupling @xmath5 between the @xmath6 and @xmath7 electrons at cu sites . </S>",
    "<S> a pair of magnons is excited through second - order processes in @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> calculated momentum dependence of rixs spectra agrees well with experimental one . </S>",
    "<S> a notable difference from previous calculations based on the heisenberg spin models is that rixs spectra have a sizable two - magnon weight at the zone center , which may be hidden by or subtracted with the elastic line in experiments . </S>"
