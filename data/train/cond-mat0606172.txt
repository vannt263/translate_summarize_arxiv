    "optimization problem is an important topic in vast area of science .",
    "the most typical example is searching the ground state of random spin system such as the spin glass .",
    "the free energy landscape of random spin system is very complex .",
    "therefore , we encounter the difficulty that the system does not reach the ground state but stays in the metastable one . there are two types of slowing down .",
    "one is the case where the state is trapped at a energetically metastable state .",
    "an energy barrier prevents the state from escaping to the equilibrium state .",
    "this is _energetic slowing down_. on the other hand , though there is no energy barrier , the system can not reach the equilibrium state in a short time which has been found in the regularly decorated bond system @xcite,@xcite .",
    "we called this situation _entropic slowing down_. in the latter case , we have found that effective time scale @xmath0 of the ordering process becomes extremely long and the relaxation process is practically frozen . in this case",
    "it is difficult to find the energy minimam stracture using the thermal annealing process .",
    "kadowaki and nishimori @xcite have proposed the quantum annealing method for the energetic slowing down system .",
    "afterward , the efficiency of the quantum annealing method has been confirmed in the energetic slowing down system @xcite,@xcite .",
    "our aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficiency of the quantum annealing method in the entropic slowing down system .",
    "we study the decorated bond system depicted in fig .",
    "1 as an example of systems with `` entropically slowing down '' . the hamiltonian of this system is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of the decorated spin @xmath3 .",
    "the effective coupling @xmath4 between @xmath5 and @xmath6 is defined @xmath7 . in the case of fig .",
    "1 , the contributions through the decoration spins are canceled out each other and @xmath8 due to the direct interaction .",
    "however , the dynamics is not simple as the case of the single bond . if the system is trapped at the state depicted in fig .",
    "1-(b ) , it does not easily reach the equilibrium state due to the entropy effect @xcite . in this case , the thermal annealing is not efficient and the relaxation time is about @xmath9 for this system to reach the ground state @xcite . here",
    ", we introduce quantum annealing using the time dependent transverse field @xmath10 , and we change the transverse field as @xmath11 .     and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the dotted lines denote the antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath13 .",
    "the black triangles denote @xmath14 spin and the gray spins are not fixed ( @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) spin .",
    "( a ) the ground state with the correlation function @xmath16 .",
    "( b ) the _entropically metastable state_ with @xmath17 . in order to relax to ( a ) from this configuration , all the gray spins must be align to cancel the interaction from the black spins .",
    "but the probability of happening of this situation is very small .",
    "this is entropic slowing down . ]",
    "we study the real time dynamics of the decorated bond system with the time dependent transverse field . here",
    ", the time evolution of the state vector @xmath18 is determined by the schrdinger equation .",
    "the initial state @xmath19 is the ground state of the initial hamiltonian @xmath20 .",
    "figure 2 shows the energy as a function of the transverse field , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . it should be noted that there are two - fold evident degeneracy because of the up - down symmetry of spin . in fig .",
    "2 , we find that the ground state at @xmath25 is connected to that of @xmath26 .",
    "thus the adiabatic motion leads the system to the true ground state of @xmath26 . in this sense ,",
    "the success of quantum annealing is insured .",
    "now we study properties of the quantum annealing .",
    "first , the @xmath27 dependence of the probability @xmath28 to reach the ground state of @xmath29 . fig .",
    "3 shows @xmath28 as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "there we find that the slower the speed of the sweep , the larger @xmath28 . in the quantum mechanical system",
    ", we have several method to obtain the ground state such as the power method , lanczos method _ etc_. these methods are also possible processes to obtain the ground state .",
    "we will compare these methods as the annealing process and be reported elsewhere .    ) as a function of transverse field . ]",
    "here we assume ferromagnetic interaction between @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "thus the fig .",
    "1(a ) gives the ground state .",
    "however if @xmath30 and @xmath31 are antiparallel initially , the decorated spins denoted by rightward triangles align upwards and the decorated spins denoted as the right half of the triangles remain disorder . in order to change @xmath30 and @xmath31 antiparallel to parallel , all of the left half of the triangle must align , which is difficult .",
    "this is called `` entropically slowing down '' .",
    "here we treated an easy example to find the ground state and to demonstrate the efficiency of the quantum annealing .",
    "the decorated bond systems with larger number of @xmath2 ( _ e.g. _ @xmath32 ) have been studied to research the temperature dependent structure @xcite .",
    "when @xmath2 increases the energy levels are much closer and the annealing becomes more difficult , which will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
