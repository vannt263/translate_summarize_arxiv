    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) contains multiple cp - violating complex phases .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the standard model which has only one phase in the ckm matrix . since the standard model does not provide sufficient cp violation to account for the observed baryon asymmetry of our universe , this new contribution to cp violation is welcomed",
    "however , even with the additional sources of cp violation available in the mssm , it is non - trivial to achieve a sufficient baryon asymmetry .",
    "numerous groups have made detailed quantitative analyses of the asymmetry .",
    "for example , see @xcite .",
    "these studies have placed stringent constraints on the allowed parameters of the mssm .",
    "data from lep further eliminate a large part of this parameter space .",
    "the starting point for our analysis is the constrained region of parameter space that satisfies bounds from lep and produces a sufficient baryon to photon ratio .",
    "we discuss the allowed parameter space in section [ sec : status ] . assuming that the mssm baryogenesis scenario is correct , and we lie in this region of parameter space",
    ", we investigate the consequences that would be accessible in collider physics .",
    "because @xmath0-physics has been viewed as a potential proving ground for theories of baryogenesis , we pay particular attention to the @xmath0-physics consequences of the scenario , addressing them in sections [ sec : bsg ] and [ sec : bmixing ] .",
    "we find an overall enhancement in @xmath1 and @xmath2 mixing to be the signature of baryogenesis in @xmath0 physics .",
    "however , the effect is rather subtle , with no new effects in cp violation contrary to naive expectations .",
    "the observation of light scalar top quark , charginos and higgs boson are necessary conditions to confirm the scenario .",
    "however , the mere observation will not provide the proof of new cp violating phases necessary for the baryogenesis .",
    "we find that a linear collider represents the best tool for determining whether a complex phase in the mssm is responsible for the cosmological baryon asymmetry .",
    "in this section , we discuss the mssm spectrum that is selected by the constraint that the mssm provides a large enough baryon asymmetry .",
    "the literature @xcite is in good agreement on qualitative features of the spectrum selected out relevant to collider signatures . while there is not a complete quantitative agreement on the amount of baryon asymmetry that can be generated in this scenario , recent calculations do agree within an order of magnitude , which is impressive considering that they take very different approaches in calculating the baryon asymmetry .",
    "the crucial cp violation responsible for the baryon asymmetry is in the chargino sector .",
    "if we write the chargino mass matrix as @xmath3 the complex phase @xmath4 represents a source of cp violation not present in the standard model . as explained in @xcite , this phase leads to the dominant contribution to the baryon asymmetry . as the universe undergoes a first - order electroweak phase transition , bubbles of the true vacuum ( where the gauge bosons are massive ) nucleate .",
    "charginos in the unbroken phase can then scatter off the expanding bubble walls .",
    "the complex phase gives rise to a classical force that separates @xmath5 from @xmath6 .",
    "this , in and of itself , does not create a baryon asymmetry .",
    "however , the asymmetry between higgsinos can be transformed into a chiral quark asymmetry through higgsino scatterings off gluinos or stops .",
    "then the chiral quark asymmetry can be further transformed into a baryon asymmetry through the electroweak anomaly , which only acts on the left - handed fields and violates @xmath7 .",
    "the qualitative picture outlined above only achieves quantitative success for specific regions of susy parameter space .",
    "one significant constraint is that the phase transition must be first - order . without a first - order transition ,",
    "the bubble picture is not valid at all . only after including two - loop corrections to the effective potential",
    "does it become possible to achieve a first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "moreover , the right - handed stop must be as light as possible .",
    "in particular , the right - handed stop mass should be less than @xmath8 @xcite . while there have been searches for the stop at both lep and the tevatron , the limits are somewhat model dependent .",
    "limits from lep indicate that the lightest stop is heavier than roughly 90 gev , while the limit from cdf indicates @xmath9 gev if the lightest neutralino is not too heavy @xcite . in either case , the current limit is still consistent with the requirement to have a stop light enough to achieve a first order phase transition .",
    "electroweak baryogenesis also constrains @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath11 is too large , the cp asymmetry vanishes . to see this",
    ", note that as @xmath12 , an entry in the chargino mass matrix of equation ( [ eqn : massmatrix ] ) vanishes , and the phase of @xmath13 can be rotated away with impunity . taking these considerations into account , it is suggested in @xcite that a value of @xmath14 is preferred .",
    "the group of @xcite has suggested that @xmath15 is necessary @xcite .",
    "taking these values into account , on the other hand , it is not trivial to avoid the bounds on the lightest higgs mass from lep ii @xcite . at the tree - level ,",
    "the lightest higgs mass is smaller for smaller @xmath16 , and needs to be boosted by the radiative correction that goes approximately as @xmath17 where @xmath18 gev .",
    "since @xmath19 must be light , @xmath20 is also light , and the correction will be small unless @xmath21 is somewhat sizeable . to evade the higgs mass bound from lep",
    ", we take @xmath22 to be 1 tev . according to reference",
    "@xcite , this is the minimum value necessary , and even heavier values are necessary over most of the parameter space",
    ". nevertheless , our conclusions regarding @xmath0 physics are unchanged for the case of even heavier stops .",
    "a non - zero @xmath4 generically has important consequences for phenomenology .",
    "in particular , one expects susy contribution to electric dipole moments ( edm ) to be too large .",
    "this constrains the masses of first two generations of superpartners .",
    "reference @xcite finds that @xmath23 10 tev is necessary to avoid the edm constraint for @xmath24 . because the baryon asymmetry results from the chargino scattering at the time of phase transition , charginos can not be too heavy .",
    "reference @xcite finds that @xmath25 gev to provide sufficient asymmetry , but the chargino masses must also satisfy the lep bound @xmath26 103.5 gev @xcite . for simplicity , we set the @xmath27-terms to zero for quantitative analyses because it is not important .",
    "this is an extremely well - defined scenario .",
    "we investigate the consequences of this scenario in the following sections .",
    "it is important to note that the phase @xmath4 is the key to baryogenesis , and not the phase of @xmath28 .",
    "this causes a qualitative change in the possible @xmath0-physics signatures .",
    "many previous analyses @xcite , concentrated on the phase of the susy - breaking parameter @xmath28 found in the stop mixing matrix .",
    "one place where one might expect evidence for this scenario to show up is in the @xmath29 decay . indeed , this turns out to be a good place to put a constraint on the charged higgs boson in the mssm , but not particularly useful to find evidence for or exclude the scenario .",
    "there is an extensive literature on the effects of supersymmetry on this process @xcite .",
    "a notable result is that the branching ratio is always enhanced by the charged higgs boson exchange .",
    "however , given the moderate values of @xmath16 required to achieve sufficient baryon asymmetry in the scenario and lep constraint on the lightest higgs boson mass , the charged higgs boson is preferred to be heavy and its effect is negligible . on the other hand ,",
    "if the lightest higgs boson will not be discovered soon , the requirement that sphaeleron erasure not wash out the baryon asymmetry could force a somewhat lighter charged higgs boson mass @xcite .",
    "it is still possible to have a relatively light charged higgs consistent with the lep constraint , if we allow multi - tev left - handed stop . in this case , the tension with the @xmath29 branching ratio is exacerbated . in our numerical studies ,",
    "we take the charged higgs to be somewhat heavy , 1 tev , to alleviate some of this tension with @xmath29 , and assume that the lightest higgs boson will be discovered soon .",
    "a contribution to @xmath30 @xmath31 that is necessarily there in this scenario , independent of the charged higgs mass , is the chargino exchange .",
    "as long as the left - handed stop is sufficiently heavy @xcite , the phase of @xmath13 drops out , and this diagram has a definite sign , opposite to the sign of the standard model and charged higgs contributions .",
    "therefore , the chargino contribution tends to help agreement between the prediction @xcite and the branching ratio measured at cleo @xcite .",
    "we plot the branching ratio in figure [ fig : cleo ] .",
    "the message is that this scenario is perfectly consistent with the @xmath30 @xmath32 branching ratio constraint .",
    "@xmath31 branching ratio .",
    "we have shown the one - sigma region for the cleo measurements , combining all errors in quadrature .",
    "also shown is the region excluded by the lep bound , @xmath33 gev .",
    "we set @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "other third generation sparticles are at a tev , and the first and second superpartners are at 10 tev .",
    "we neglect the gluino contribution not required by baryogenesis , and set the scalar trilinear coupling to zero.,title=\"fig:\"][fig : cleo ]    there is also a potentially important contribution from gluino exchange if there is flavor mixing among the squarks .",
    "this is a contribution generically possible in the mssm ( currently with only mild constraint ; see @xcite ) and not required in the baryogenesis .",
    "therefore , we do not regard the gluino contribution as a signal of baryogenesis and neglect it in the rest of the paper .    as alluded to above ,",
    "if the lightest higgs boson is not discovered soon , smaller values of the charged higgs boson mass may be necessary .",
    "however , the @xmath37 @xmath31 branching ratio constrains how light the charged higgs boson can be .",
    "in particular , to be consistent with cdf bound on stop , assuming @xmath38 , we find that @xmath39 gev to have a small enough branching ratio for @xmath29 . to be consistent with the lep bound on stop ( which is slightly less dependent on the neutralino masses ) the charged higgs mass can be as light as 380 gev . to get",
    "a much lighter value of the charged higgs mass would require a model dependent gluino contribution to cancel off some of the @xmath30 @xmath31 amplitude .",
    "as we have already stated , @xmath4 decouples from the chargino exchange diagram when there is large splitting between the stops .",
    "this means that there is no chance to induce a large asymmetry @xmath40 for this decay .",
    "other studies @xcite have found potentially observable cp asymmetries , but they looked over much larger regions of parameter space , and allowed a large phase for @xmath28 , which is not an essential feature of the mssm baryogenesis scenario . using the formalism of @xcite , we have investigated the possibility of an an asymmetry @xmath41 . we find that in the mssm baryogenesis picture , where only the right - handed stop is light , and the only complex phase is @xmath4 , the asymmetry @xmath41 is less than 1% .",
    "another potential arena for finding deviations from the standard model is @xmath0 mixing measurements . in particular",
    ", @xmath0 factories are making precise measurements of @xmath42 mixing , while run ii at the tevatron should allow vastly increased sensitivity to @xmath43 mixing . the main difficulty with using these two measurements as a probe of new physics lies with the large theoretical errors involved in their calculation .",
    "the deviations in @xmath43 mixing in this scenario are shown in figure 2 .",
    "we take @xmath44 .",
    "we set @xmath45 for simplicity , but this is a good assumption  the region @xmath46 is favored to get sufficient baryon asymmetry in any case . in the figure , we have set the charged higgs mass to be relatively heavy , at 1 tev because large charged higgs masses are favored , to increase the the lightest higgs mass .",
    "this , in effect , isolates the chargino contribution to the mixing .",
    "we see that the maximal deviation is about @xmath47 .",
    "the plot in the figure is for @xmath48 , but we have checked that as long as the lightest chargino mass is kept fixed , there is not a great deal of sensitivity to @xmath49 .",
    "this is due to the large splitting between the @xmath50 and the @xmath19 states .     mixing in the mssm baryogenesis scenario .",
    "we have plotted contours of @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the magnitude of the amplitude for the @xmath53 mixing hamiltonian in the full theory and standard model , respectively .",
    "we take @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 tev.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig : bmixing ]    the additional amplitude has the same phase as the standard model contribution .",
    "this is because the @xmath58 does not couple to wino and hence its contribution singles out the higgsino coupling in the chargino state",
    ". therefore the coupling is given by @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "as a result , no significant deviation in cp - violating observables induced by @xmath0-mixing is expected .",
    "this is a direct result of the higgs mass bound , which forces the left - handed stop to be heavy in the mssm baryogenesis scenario .",
    "we should note that there is a potential for gluino box diagrams to contribute .",
    "however , the point of this exercise is to capture the essential signals of the baryogenesis scenario .",
    "a large gluino contribution is not essential in this framework , so we choose to neglect these contributions",
    ". its presence may be an evidence for supersymmetry , but not the mssm baryogenesis .    given the enhancement in @xmath0-mixing amplitudes in the scenario , the problem is that current theoretical errors make it difficult to identify this enhancement in @xmath0 mixing amplitudes .",
    "there are two major sources of theoretical error for calculating @xmath0-mixing in the standard model .",
    "first , there is imperfect knowledge of the relevant ckm matrix elements . in the standard model , @xmath61",
    "is indirectly determined from @xmath0-mixing , which is not appropriate in the presence of new physics contribution .",
    "other constraints on @xmath61 come from @xmath62 and future measurements of @xmath63 .",
    "however , these constraints will remain relatively weak in the foreseeable future .",
    "another approach is to assume unitarity of the ckm matrix . in this case , the relatively poor knowledge of @xmath64 makes constraining @xmath61 difficult . a more precise determination of @xmath64 ( possibly down to 510% level @xcite ) and @xmath65 ( to the few % level at either lhc - b , b - tev , or superbabar @xcite ) in the future could determine @xmath61 to a sufficient accuracy .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath66 , the relevant parameter for @xmath43 mixing , is essentially determined by unitarity @xmath67 possibly down to 23% level in the future @xcite .",
    "the second major source of theoretical error in @xmath0-mixing calculations comes from hadronic matrix parameters which are found from lattice calculations . @xmath42-mixing depends on the combination @xmath68 , while @xmath43-mixing depends on @xmath69 .",
    "the latest unquenched evaluation from jlqcd @xcite , quotes an error for @xmath69 of roughly @xmath70 .",
    "although the enhancement is not presently observable given current theoretical errors , there is hope . over the next few years , it should be possible to reduce the errors on @xmath69 to approximately 5% in a quenched calculation in the next few years .",
    "similar errors for the unquenched calculation should be available on the 5 to 10 year time scale @xcite .",
    "when such a calculation is available , the enhancement of @xmath43-mixing could be discernible .",
    "we also note that , as long as the model - dependent gluino contributions are neglected , the ratio of @xmath43-mixing to @xmath42-mixing is identical to the standard model prediction . because some lattice uncertainties cancel in this ratio , it should be able to confirm this prediction , particularly once advances are made in the determination of @xmath71 .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that in the case where the charged higgs boson mass is lighter , it serves to enhance the @xmath0-mixing by a few additional per cent at most .",
    "the reason is that the biggest enhancement to this process comes from the exchange of charginos and the very light right - handed stop squark .",
    "although @xmath43 mixing may indirectly indicate light charginos and a light stop , it will leave many questions unanswered .",
    "first , is @xmath4 non - zero ?",
    "because it is this phase that provides the new source of cp violation , we should not be convinced that the mssm explains baryogenesis unless we have produced evidence of a non - zero @xmath4 .",
    "obviously , it will be desirable to observe the light super - partners directly . in this scenario ,",
    "only the right - handed stop and the charginos may be observable at the tevatron run - ii , lhc and the next linear collider .",
    "however , even if the light superpartners are observed at the tevatron or lhc , it seems unlikely that one could discern that there is a non - zero phase for the @xmath13 parameter .",
    "it seems that a linear collider , where one can make precision measurements of the chargino system , is the best bet for observing this phase .",
    "it has been shown that a complete reconstruction of the mass matrix ( [ eqn : massmatrix ] ) is possible at a linear collider where the charginos are accessible .",
    "for example , see @xcite . to be explicit",
    ", the phase can be written in terms of other observables as @xcite : @xmath72 where @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath75 , and @xmath76 are mixing angles that arise in the diagonalization of the matrix of equation  ( [ eqn : massmatrix ] ) .",
    "the angles @xmath77 and @xmath78 can be extracted from measuring chargino production cross sections .",
    "the great precision to which a linear collider can measure the masses and the mixings of the charginos allows access to the phase @xmath4 , proving the origin of the baryon asymmetry in the electroweak phase transition .",
    "it would also be satisfying to observe this cp - violating phase through the measurement of a cp - odd quantity .",
    "the prospects for such measurements at a linear collider have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "while there are any number of ways to disprove the mssm baryogenesis scenario , it seems a non - trivial task to verify it .",
    "circumstantial evidence could be found for the correct spectrum through measurements of @xmath43 mixing , which could indicate the presence of a light stop and light charginos .",
    "the absence of a light stop or a fairly light higgs would immediately spell trouble for this scenario , and if they are not found at the tevatron or the lhc , it seems reasonable to dismiss the mssm as the source of baryon number in our universe .",
    "however , even if these particles are present , we should not be convinced that the mssm provides the baryogenesis mechanism unless we have evidence of a new cp violating phases .",
    "it is unlikely to observe this phase by looking for cp violation at the @xmath0-factories . to ultimately determine that a phase is present in the chargino matrix",
    "would fall upon a future linear collider .",
