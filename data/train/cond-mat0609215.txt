    "@xcite all the structures consist of two units : a pentagonal bipyramid and a distorted octahedron connecting to each other with different angles .",
    "as we shall see , the existence of these nearly degenerate structures have a bearing on the shape of the specific heat curve at low temperatures . in high energy structures ,",
    "the octahedron is destroyed first ( figs .",

    "so far as li@xmath0 is concerned , a single al atom replaces one of the li atoms in one unit of the pentagonal bipyramids in the gs geometry of li@xmath0al ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 - 2]c(i ) ) .",
    "this causes the li atoms in another unit to rearrange in the form of antiprism , with al atom at the center . as shown in figs .",

    "the equilibrium structures of li@xmath0al@xmath2 do not show the pentagonal bipyramidal structure any more .",

    "this is because two al atoms share li atoms equally to fill their unoccupied _ p_orbitals .",
    "the nearly degenerate structure shown in fig .",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite the stability of two nearly degenerate structures has been verified by carrying out a vibrational analysis .",
    "the structures with broken symmetry have higher energies ( figs .  [ fig1 - 2]d(iv ) @xmath18 [ fig1 - 2]d(vi ) ) .    2.8 in    we used the deformation parameter @xmath19 to examine the shape of the clusters .",
    "@xmath19 is defined as , @xmath20 where @xmath21 are eigenvalues of the quadrupole tensor @xmath22 with @xmath23 being _",

    "a spherical system has @xmath19 = 1 ( @xmath26 ) , while @xmath27 1 indicates a deformation .",
    "the calculated @xmath19 for the gs geometry of the clusters are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "it can be seen that doping reduces the deformation considerably .",
    "we also show the binding energies of these clusters in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "clearly the increase in the binding energy by adding al atom ( 0.2  ev / atom ) is much higher than that by adding li atom ( 0.04  ev / atom ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the increase of the binding energy in the mixed clusters is mainly due to the formation of strong li  al bonds .    2.6 in    we examine the change in the nature of the bonding due to the presence of al atoms via the total electron charge density , and the molecular orbitals ( mo s ) .",
    "in addition , we have also calculated the difference charge density between electron charge densities of mixed cluster li@xmath0al@xmath15 ( @xmath16=1,2 ) and separated units of li@xmath0 and al@xmath15 ( @xmath16=1,2 ) , by keeping the atomic positions the same as those in the mixed cluster .",
    "we first examine the charge distribution in al@xmath2 dimer and li  al diatomic cluster .",
    "evidently , there is a covalent bond in al@xmath2 dimer as expected , while li ",
    "al diatomic cluster shows a polar bond .",
    "this can be explained on the basis of electronegativity difference between li(0.98 ) and al(1.61 ) , which is not large enough to establish an ionic bond .",
    "we note that the bond lengths of these clusters are 2.68    for al  al and 2.88    for li  al .",
    "the isovalued surface of total charge density in li@xmath0al and li@xmath0al@xmath2 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and [ fig3](b ) , respectively . in figs .",
    "[ fig4](a ) to [ fig4](d ) , we show the isosurface of difference charge density for these al  doped clusters .",
    "when we add one al atom to the li@xmath0 cluster , the total charge distribution shows a mixed character of localization near al atom and delocalization on the pentagonal bipyramid in li@xmath0al ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ) .",
    "it can be seen that the charge , localized around al atom in the antiprism part , is nearly spherical .",
    "this is due to a significant charge transfer from nearby li atoms to the al atom to fill its unoccupied @xmath28orbitals however , there is an insignificant charge transfer from the li atoms to the al atom , forming the pentagonal bipyramidal unit .",
    "this leads to a delocalized charge distribution in this unit .    3.0 in    this observation",
    "is confirmed by the examination of figs .",
    "[ fig4](a ) and [ fig4](b ) , depicting the constant density contour of the difference charge density .",
    "it may be noted that the values of the maxima in the difference charge density are 0.042 and 0.051 , and those of the minima are -0.037 and -0.084 in li@xmath0al and li@xmath0al@xmath2 , respectively . figs .",
    "[ fig4](a ) to [ fig4](d ) show the isosurfaces for the value of 0.017 for the charge gain , and -0.008 for the charge loss .",
    "it can be seen that a ring shape region in between li and al ( around al ) gains charge in li@xmath0al ( fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) ) .",
    "further , most of the charge is lost by li atoms nearer to the al atom ( fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ) .",
    "this charge transfer from li to al causes li atoms to be positively charged .",
    "these positively charged li atoms pull the charge distribution around al atom to polarize it .",
    "this leads to a multicentered bonding between al atom and nearby li atoms .",
    "the addition of one more al atom changes the charge density distribution from a mixed localized and delocalized one to a mainly localized one . in li@xmath0al@xmath2 , the charge distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ) is mainly around two al atoms polarized by nearby li atoms .",
    "the difference charge density shows a very symmetric charge gain region in between li and al atoms ( fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) ) and loss of charge at each atomic site ( fig .",
    "[ fig4](d ) ) .",
    "these difference in the bonding between li@xmath0al and li@xmath0al@xmath2 are also seen in molecular orbitals ( figures not shown ) .",
    "for example , in li@xmath0al three highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) show a delocalized charge distribution , while only the homo shows a delocalization in li@xmath0al@xmath2 . as noted earlier , since electronegativity difference of li and al is not very high ,",
    "the li atoms donate their charge to al atom(s ) partially .",
    "we expect this charge transfer to result in weakening of li  li metallic bond in the system .",
    "this feature has also been noted in li@xmath11sn cluster .",
    "@xcite further , this partial charge transfer also results in the sharing of charge between two al atoms to fill their unoccupied @xmath28orbitals in li@xmath0al@xmath2 .",
    "as we shall see , this difference in the bonding leads to a different thermodynamic behavior in two clusters .    2.8 in        to investigate the melting behavior of the clusters , we calculate the canonical specific heat using multiple histogram technique .",
    "the calculated ionic specific heats for all the clusters are shown in fig .",
    "it is well known that a small cluster exibits a broad melting transition .",
    "our observatios are consistent with this observation .",
    "in addition , in li@xmath0 the ionic specific heat also shows a remarkable premelting feature between 150  k and 225  k , whose maximum value is close to that of the main peak around 575  k. the examination of the ionic motion reveals that the two structures shown in figs.[fig1 - 1]a(i ) and [ fig1 - 1]a(ii ) are observed in the temperature range of 150  k @xmath18225  k. the system visits these two isomers in the time spent of a few pico seconds at 175  k , indicating that this premelting feature is due to the isomerization . at higher temperature of 260  k , we observe the structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 - 1]a(iii ) . at still higher temperatures",
    ", the cluster visits these three isomers frequently .",
    "it is difficult to identify the melting temperature for this cluster because liquidlike behavior develops over a wide range of temperature ( 300  k to 700  k ) .",
    "mean  square bond length fluctuation ( @xmath29 ) is another indicator for studying a melting transition . according to the lindemann criteria ( for bulk ) solid ",
    "liquid transition is signified when the value of @xmath29 exceeds 0.1 .",
    "however , it is generally observed that for clusters a liquidlike behavior is seen when @xmath29 exceeds 0.25@xmath180.3 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , @xmath29 increases in two steps . at 175",
    "k it exceeds the value of 0.1 , which corresponds to maximum specific heat of the shoulder . however , as discussed earlier , the cluster is not in the liquidlike state .",
    "@xmath29 increases from 200  k again until it saturates about 0.3 at 575  k where we observe the maximum value of the specific heat .",
    "the specific heat of li@xmath1 shows a weak shoulder around 125  k before it increases gradually .",
    "this shoulder is related to the existence of five degenerate isomers . at low temperatures up to 150  k ,",
    "the motion is dominated by vibrations and the cluster visits the low energy isomers . as temperature increases , the liquidlike behavior evolves over a very wide range of temperature . at 175  k ,",
    "we observe high energy isomers where the octahedral structure is absent ( two of them are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 - 1]b(iv ) and [ fig1 - 1]b(v ) ) . with further increase of temperature to 375  k , we observe that the pentagonal bipyramidal structure is destroyed ( one of these structures is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 - 1]b(vi ) ) . it can be seen that @xmath29 also increases continuously from 125  k to 500  k ( fig .  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that even though the isomerization is seen in both the clusters li@xmath0 and li@xmath1 , evidently the isomerization in li@xmath0 leads to a prominent shoulder in its specific heat .",
    "this is related to the nature of the process by which their ground state visits the isomer(s ) . in the case of li@xmath0",
    ", there is a barrier at about 175  k. the system overcomes this barrier with sudden increase in the accessible density of states . for li@xmath1 ,",
    "since the different isomers differ only in the angle between two constituent units , the ground state visits them almost continuously , aided by the vibrational motion .",
    "this results in different specific heat curves .",
    "2.8 in      in can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] that li@xmath0al shows a premelting feature in the low temperature region around 150  k. this may be caused by a weakening of the li ",
    "li metallic bond due to the charge transfer from li atoms to the al atom in antiprism unit .",
    "this effect has also been observed in li@xmath11sn .",
    "@xcite the li atoms in this unit break the li  li bonds at low temperature and one of them moves towards the pentagonal bipyramidal unit .",
    "this is the way the cluster visits the other low energy isomers shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 - 2]c(ii ) and [ fig1 - 2]c(iii ) . for the temperatures above 175  k ,",
    "we observe the motion of li atoms around the al atom without destroying the overall shape of the structure .",
    "however , the four li atoms consisting of pentagonal bipyramidal unit do not interchange their position with others till about 575  k. at this temperature , the system shows a diffusive liquidlike behavior .",
    "we calculate the root ",
    "mean  square bond length fluctuation ( @xmath29 ) for li  li , li ",
    "al , and al ",
    "al separately , to see the difference between their fluctuations .",
    "@xmath29 is defined as , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the distance between @xmath32 and @xmath33 ions with @xmath34 and @xmath35 for relevant bonds , and @xmath9 is the number of bonds . @xmath36 ... @xmath37 denotes a time average over the entire trajectory .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] that in the low temperature region @xmath29 of li ",
    "al is much lower than that of li  li .",
    "this is because of relatively stronger li  al bond .",
    "interestingly , the specific heat of li@xmath0al@xmath2 at low temperature also shows a shoulder which is very similar to the specific heat of li@xmath0 .",
    "after this premelting feature , the specific heat remains flat .",
    "this is due to the presence of al dimer in the cluster .",
    "when we compare its molecular orbitals with those of pure al dimer , they looked alike even though their bond lengths are different .",
    "the bond length of al  al in li@xmath0al@xmath2 is 2.97 , while that of pure al dimer is 2.68 .",
    "thus , there is a weak covalent bond between al atoms .",
    "this covalent bond between them restricts the motion of al atoms .",
    "we observe that al - al bond does not break at least up to the temperature of about 800  k. as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , @xmath29 of li  li and li  al saturate to a value of about 2.5 at 500  k , while that of al  al reaches a value of 0.1 at 800  k. the saturation values of @xmath29 for li  li and li  al are lower than corresponding @xmath29 of other clusters , indicating the motion of atoms in li@xmath0al@xmath2 is more restricted than other systems at comparable temperature .",
    "we have employed _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics to study the equilibrium geometries , the electronic structure , and the finite temperature properties of pure lithium clusters li@xmath0 and li@xmath1 , and al  doped lithium clusters li@xmath0al and li@xmath0al@xmath2 .",
    "we find that there is a substantial structural change upon doping with two al atoms , while the addition of one al atom results in a rearrangement .",
    "the analysis of the total charge density and the molecular orbitals reveal that there is a partial charge transfer from li atoms to al atom(s ) in al ",
    "doped clusters , forming a polar bond between them .",
    "this leads to a multicentered bonding and weakens the li ",
    "li metallic bonds in these clusters . in li@xmath0al@xmath2 , al atoms also form a weak covalent bond .",
    "these changes in the nature of bonding upon doping affect the finite temperature properties of pure host cluster .",
    "we observe that the presence of dimer  like al atoms with weak covalent bond confines the motion of li atoms around them .",
    "thus , a substitution of two li atoms by al atoms in li@xmath1 leads to a surface melting only , showing a continuous phase change over a very broad range of temperature .",
