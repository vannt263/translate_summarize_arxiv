    "the study of dynamics and pattern formation in nonlinear spatially extended dynamical systems continues to attract considerable attention @xcite , with potential solution behaviors ranging from attracting steady states to complex spatiotemporal dynamics including spatiotemporal chaos ( stc ) , which is characterized by temporally chaotic dynamics with decaying spatial correlations and a finite density of positive lyapunov exponents @xcite .    in the search for general principles ,",
    "much effort has gone into the derivation and study of simplified model equations to highlight and clarify pattern - forming properties of more complicated `` full '' systems .",
    "such paradigmatic models , such as the ginzburg - landau equation for the slow evolution of modulations of an underlying pattern , have been remarkably fruitful in predicting the leading - order scaling behavior and stability of patterns , by comparison with numerical or experimental results .",
    "the identification of relevant scaling laws forms an integral part of the asymptotic procedures used to derive such reduced model systems .",
    "the successful application of such methods rests on the expectation that the leading - order truncation obtained subject to a consistent scaling assumption indeed captures the dominant scaling of the full problem , in the sense that the perturbative effects of neglected terms are `` small '' and occur at the scaling implied by the dominant balance . in this paper , we present an example which appears to challenge this expectation .    it is known from various examples that the stability of finite - wavelength pattern or wave phenomena may be complicated through interaction with a mean flow ; for instance , in convection with free - slip boundary conditions @xcite , in some reaction - diffusion systems @xcite and elsewhere , such coupling can lead to unusual instability mechanisms of the underlying pattern or flow , whose analysis may display mixing of scales in the perturbation parameter and require higher - order terms in the perturbative expansions for a complete understanding @xcite .    in the present work we study a model for one - dimensional pattern formation in the presence of continuous symmetry , for which the interaction of modes with two well - separated length scales leads to spatiotemporal chaos .",
    "focussing in this case on characterizing the long - term chaotic regime rather than on its onset via the initial stability problem , for the statistics of the long - wave mode we find a scaling discrepancy between predictions of leading - order multiple - scale analysis and computations of the full system .",
    "unexpectedly , though , the agreement in scaling is restored by including next - order corrections in the amplitude equations .",
    "we investigate the nikolaevskiy partial differential equation ( pde ) , given in canonical ( derivative ) form as @xmath0 u\\ ] ] ( where @xmath1 ) , which was originally proposed as a model for longitudinal seismic waves in viscoelastic media @xcite , and has more recently been obtained in the context of phase dynamics in reaction - diffusion systems @xcite and finite - wavelength transverse instabilities of traveling fronts @xcite .",
    "in fact , the nikolaevskiy equation has a continuous symmetry  in the form it is galilean - invariant , and preserves the spatial mean  and appears to be a paradigmatic model for short - wave pattern formation with such symmetry @xcite .",

    "we show that nikolaevskiy stc exhibits yet more unexpected scaling : amplitudes and correlation times of the large - scale mode @xmath16 have an anomalous dependence on @xmath21 , seemingly inconsistent with leading - order multiple - scale analysis , though recovered with the addition of next - order terms to the amplitude equations",
    ". in particular , in the chaotic regime the mean - square amplitude of @xmath16 appears to scale as @xmath22 , rather than the predicted @xmath23 .",
    "we numerically computed ( mean - zero ) solutions of the nikolaevskiy equation on an @xmath24-periodic domain in the chaotic regime , over a wider @xmath25-range than in earlier studies : @xmath26 .",
    "the system size @xmath24 was chosen so that the number of fourier modes in the unstable band of the dispersion relation @xmath27 , about @xmath28 , sufficed to capture the large - system limit ; to minimize system size effects across our computations , we fixed the domain length in the slow space variable @xmath10 , at @xmath29 with @xmath30=1 and 2 ( about 12 and 25 unstable modes , respectively ) , and checked our results with @xmath30=4 .",

    "however , for sufficiently `` small '' @xmath25 , we observe the distinct gap between the @xmath39 and @xmath40 energetic modes which characterizes `` nikolaevskiy chaos '' @xcite .",
