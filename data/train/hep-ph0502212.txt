    "= 10.00 cm    in fig .",
    "[ fig_lambda_nf ] we show our results for @xmath96 together with recent experimental values from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it appears that the lattice results extrapolate smoothly to the experimental values at @xmath200  @xcite and @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "however , our @xmath27 result lies two standard deviations below the corresponding phenomenological value ( open triangle ) .",
    "( the reader should be aware that the sometimes called experimental numbers imply a good deal of modelling and , thus , should be regarded as phenomenological numbers . )",
    "= 10.00 cm    in order to compare @xmath28 from various experiments and theory , it must be evolved to a common scale . for convenience",
    "this is taken to be the mass of the @xmath7 boson , @xmath201 .",
    "having computed @xmath96 for @xmath27 flavours , we may use the 4-loop expansion of @xmath28 and the 3-loop matching condition at the quark thresholds  @xcite to determine @xmath202 .",
    "we take the charm and bottom thresholds to be at @xmath203 and @xmath204 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we choose the charm and bottom quark masses to be @xmath205 and @xmath206 , respectively . varying the charm and bottom quark masses within reasonable limits has a neglible effect on the final result .",
    "we then obtain @xmath207 this is to be compared with the world average value  @xcite @xmath208 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_alphalat ] we compare our result for @xmath209 with other lattice results and experiment .",
    "we find agreement with previous lattice calculations using wilson fermions .",
    "it occurs that the wilson results lie systematically below the mean experimental value . on the other hand ,",
    "calculations using staggered fermions ( albeit from the same group ) show a better agreement with experiment .",
    "our result for @xmath210 agrees also with that of the alpha collaboration  @xcite , which does not quote a number for @xmath209 .",
    "our result for @xmath209 lies two standard deviations below the phenomenological value .",
    "due to substantial improvements of the performance of our hybrid monte carlo algorithm  @xcite , we were able to extend our dynamical simulations to smaller quark masses and to larger values of @xmath22 .",
    "our smallest lattice spacing now is @xmath211 .",
    "this enabled us to perform a chiral and continuum extrapolation of the lattice data . because the calculation involves a perturbative conversion from the lattice coupling constant to the ( mass independent ) @xmath15 constant",
    ", it was important to first extrapolate the lattice data to the chiral limit .",
    "we have discussed basically two approaches of converting the lattice coupling constant to the @xmath15 one .",
    "they differed mainly in how the non - perturbative improvement ( clover ) term was incorporated in the perturbative expansion .",
    "it was reassuring to see that both methods led to the same result in the continuum limit .",
    "this indicates once more that a reliable extrapolation to the continuum limit is very important .",
    "we could also improve on our quenched result , because data at smaller lattice spacings became available .",
    "there are several sources of systematic error in our calculation .",
    "the main error comes from setting the scale , followed by the continuum extrapolation .",
    "as better dynamical data become available , the uncertainty in setting the scale will be gradually reduced .",
    "simulations at smaller lattice spacings will become possible with the next generation of computers , which should facilitate the extrapolation to the continuum limit .",
