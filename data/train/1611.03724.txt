    "the transition metal - chalcogenide compounds t@xmath0pdch@xmath3 , where _ t _ = nb or ta and _ ch _ = s or se , are quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) superconductors with a remarkably high upper critical field@xcite , which surpasses by far the expected pauli limiting field ( _ _ h__@xmath8 = 1.84@xmath5)@xcite .",
    "these compounds achieving superconducting temperatures up to 6 k are proposed to be multi - band superconductors@xcite .",
    "band structure calculations@xcite show that the fermi surface of nb@xmath0pds@xmath3 is composed of multiple sheets , i.e. , two - dimensional sheets with hole character and q1d sheets with both electron and hole character , and this system may be in proximity to a magnetically- or charge density wave- ( cdw- ) ordered state , owing to the nesting properties of those q1d fermi surface sheets .",
    "the increase in the @xmath9 electron population on the pd site is expected to flatten the q1d fermi surface sheets ; thus , it may enhance the nesting properties and an unconventional superconducting pairing scenario is suggested@xcite .",
    "it is shown that partial substitution of pd by ni@xcite or ir@xcite leads to slightly enhanced _ _",
    "t__@xmath10 , but superconductivity is suppressed in the cases of pt - for - pd doping @xcite or ag - for - pd doping@xcite , and se - for - s doping @xcite .",
    "however , the feature of large _ _ h__@xmath4 relative to @xmath5 is found to be robust against these substitutions , providing strong experimental evidence of unconventional superconductivity in this system .",
    "as is often the case , high superconducting critical field can be attributed to the multi - band effect@xcite , strong - coupling@xcite , spin ",
    "triplet pairing@xcite , or strong spin ",
    "orbit coupling ( soc)@xcite . a study on the effect of selenium doping on nb@xmath0pds@xmath3 rules out the strong - coupling as well as spin  triplet pairing as the origin of the exotic superconductivity@xcite .",
    "in contrast , it is suggested that the large _ _ h__@xmath4 can be attributed to the strong soc associated with the heavy pd element@xcite .",
    "moreover , electronic structure calculations for ta@xmath11pds@xmath12 show that the large @xmath7 is a result of a combination of strong coupling and multi - band effects in the extreme dirty limit@xcite .",
    "these experimental and theoretical studies have verified the importance of the presence of pd irons with a large z number to the unconventional properties , where z is the atomic mass number .",
    "recently , it has been reported that the charge carrier density ( or band filling ) , which can be modulated by hole(electron)-type doping , could be a crucial factor for tuning superconductivity in this system@xcite . so far , the origin of the large _ _ h__@xmath4 and exotic superconductivity in t@xmath0pdch@xmath3 has not been understood .    in this paper",
    ", we report on a detailed investigation of the hole - type ru doping effect on superconductivity and compare with the case of similar ir doping .",
    "both ru and ir doping on pd site can be considered as a hole - type doping , but less heavy ru should have a weaker soc compared with ir or pt doping ; thus , it may help with distinguishing the different effects of charge carrier density and soc upon superconductivity .",
    "we make a comparison of the cases of ir , ag , ni , and pt doping and it turns out that @xmath6 and _ _ h__@xmath4 can be slightly enhanced by hole - type doping such as ru or ir doping , but that ir doping has a more significant effect owing to its stronger soc . our work implies that there could be a close relationship between the extremely large _ _ h__@xmath4 and soc in this q1d superconducting system .",

    "the data for three samples ( _ x _ = 0 , 0.2,and 0.3 ) are presented in the upper right inset of fig.2 .",
    "strong diamagnetic signals were observed , and meanwhile the onset temperature of magnetic transitions obviously varies with the ru content , which is consistent with the resistivity measurements .    in order to get an insight into the evolution of transport properties , the temperature dependence of the hall coefficient at various doping levels was measured . as shown in fig .",

    "r__@xmath15 as a function of temperature allows us to suggest that hole carriers dominate the transport properties at low temperature , owing to the different temperature dependence of mobility for different types of charge carriers , or possible reconstruction of the fermi surface as reported in the cuprates@xcite .",

    "it is interesting to compare the effects of ru doping with ir doping , as both are regarded as hole - type dopants .",
    "since the strength of soc is proportional to @xmath23 , ru doping should hardly change the soc associated with the pd site , while ir or pt ( ni ) doping could increase ( decrease ) the soc in the system @xcite .",

    "ru and ir doping are indicated by hollow symbols standing for hole doping ; ag doping is indicated by solid characters . it can be found that superconductivity is enhanced with a maximum _ _ t__@xmath10@xmath26 of 6.86 k by ru ( _ x _ = 0.2 ) doping , and 7.73 k by ir ( _ x _ = 0.4 ) doping .",
    "both ru and ir doping are expected to increase the hole - type carrier density , which may drive the system far away from the magnetic order or a possible cdw order and thus favor superconductivity , while the electron - type doping ( i.e. , ag doping ) has an opposite effect . in this scenario",
    ", we could understand why _ _ t__@xmath10 initially increases for both ru doping and ir doping .",
    "however , the maximum @xmath6 is even higher and the superconducting range ( up to @xmath27 of 0.8 ) is wider for the ir doping case .",
    "we propose that the enhanced soc strength owing to heavier ir may account for this difference .",
    "this result implies that not only the charge carrier density but also soc could play an important role in controlling superconductivity of nb@xmath0pds@xmath3 . as in the case of pt or ni doping , superconductivity can be easily suppressed , which may be ascribed to the positive internal pressure effect corresponding to the shrinking of the @xmath28-axis by the isovalent substitution of pd , in spite of the enhanced soc in the pt case .",
    "it should also be noted that superconductivity can survive up to very high doping level in the cases of ru or ir doping despite the disorder , which demonstrates that @xmath6 is quite robust in the hole - type doping , as compared with the iron - based superconductors lafe@xmath1co@xmath29aso and bafe@xmath30ni@xmath29as@xmath11 .",
    "careful studies on the single - crystalline nb@xmath0pd@xmath29s@xmath31 revealed that superconductivity occurs in a wide range of pd ( @xmath32 ) and s ( @xmath33 ) contents@xcite , suggesting again that superconductivity in this system is very robust .    since a previous study proposed that changes in the soc may affect the large upper critical field ( @xmath7)@xcite , it is very helpful to compare the ratio of @xmath7 to @xmath6 for different doping cases .",

    "h__@xmath4/@xmath19 tendency in the pt and ni doping cases , reported by zhou et al.@xcite these findings again suggest that charge carrier as well as the large soc in this system have significant effects on superconductivity .",
