    "in his seminal essay , `` the science of the artificial''@xcite the economist herbert simon suggested that biological systems , including those involving humans , are `` satisficing '' rather than optimising .",
    "the process of adaptation stops as soon as the result is deemed good enough , irrespective of the possibility that a better solution might be achieved by further search . in reality",
    ", there is no way to find global optima in complex environments , so there is no alternative to accepting less than perfect solutions that happen to be within reach , as ashby sustained in his `` design for a brain''@xcite .",
    "we shall present results on a schematic `` brain '' model of self - organized learning and adaptation that operates using the principle of satisficing .",
    "the individual parts of the system , called synaptic connections , are modified by a negative feedback process until the output is deemed satisfactory ; then the process stops .",
    "there is no further reward to the system once an adequate result has been achieved : this is learning by a stick , not a carrot ! the process starts up again as soon as the situation is deemed unsatisfactory , which could happen , for instance , when the external conditions change .",
    "the negative signal may represent hunger , physical pain , itching , sex - drive , or some other unsatisfied physiological demand .    formally , our sceme is a reinforcement - learning algorithm ( or rather de - inforcement learning since there is no positive feedback ) , @xcite where the strengths of the elements are updated on the bases of the signal from an external critic , with the added twist that the elements ( neuronal connections ) do not respond to positive signals .",
    "superficially , one might think that punishing unsuccessful neurons is the mirror equivalent to the usual hebbian learning where successful connections are strengthened @xcite .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "the hebbian process , like any other positive feedback , continues ad infinitum , in the absence of some ad hoc limitation .",
    "this will render the successful synapse strong , and all other synapses relatively weak , whereas the negative feedback process employed here stops as soon as the correct response is reached .",
    "the successful synaptic connections are only barely stronger than unsuccessful ones .",
    "this makes it easy for the system to forget , at least temporarily , its response and adjust to a new situation when need be .",
    "the synaptic landscapes are quite different in the two cases /citearaujo .",
    "positive reinforcement leads to a few strong synapses in a background of weak synapses .",
    "negative feedback leads to many connections of similar strength , and thus a very volatile , noncommittal structure .",
    "any positive feedback will limit the flexibility and hence the adaptability of the system .",
    "of course , there may be instances where positive reinforcement takes place , in situations where hard - wired connection have to be constructed once and for all , without concern for later adaptation to new situations .",
    "the process is self - organized in the sense that no external computation is needed .",
    "all components in the model can be thought of as representing known biological processes , where the updating of the states of synapses takes place only through local interactions , either with other neighboring neurons , or with extracellular signals transmitted simultaneously to all neurons .",
    "the process of suppressing synapses has actually been observed in the real brain and is known as long term depression , or ltd , but its role for actual brain function has been unclear @xcite . we submit that _ depression _ of synaptic efficacy is the fundamental dynamic mechanism in learning and adaptation , with ltp , the long term potentiation of synapses usually associated with hebbian learning , playing a secondary role .",
    "although we did have the real brain in mind when setting up the model , it is certainly not a realistic representation of the overwhelming intricacies of the human brain .",
    "its sole purpose is to demonstrate a general principle that is likely to be at work , and which could perhaps lead to the construction of better artificial learning systems .",
    "the model presented here is a `` paper airplane '' . which indeed can fly but is completely inadequate to explain the complexity of real airplanes .",
    "most neural network modelling so far has been concerned with the artificial construction of memories , in the shape of robust input - output connections .",
    "the strengths of those connections are usually calculated by the use of mathematical algorithms , with no concern for the dynamical biological processes that could possibly lead to their formation in a realistic `` in vivo '' situation . in the hopfield model ,",
    "memories are represented by energy minima in a spin - glass like model , where the couplings between ising spins represent synaptic strengths .",
    "if a new situation arises , the connection have to be recalculated from scratch .",
    "similarly , the back - propagation algorithm underlying most commercial neural networks is a newtonian optimization process that tunes the synaptic connections to maximize the overlap between the outputs produced by the network and the desired outputs , based on examples presented to the network .",
    "all of this may be good enough when dealing with engineering type of problems where biological reality is of no concern , but we believe that this modelling gives no insight into how real brain - like function might come about .",
    "intelligent brain function requires not only the ability to store information , such as correct input output connections .",
    "it is mandatory for the system to be able to adapt to new situations , and yet later to recall past experiences , in an ongoing dynamical process .",
    "the information stored in the brain reflects the entire history that it has experienced , and can take advantage of that experience .",
    "our model illustrates explicitly how this might take place .",
    "the extremal dynamics allows one to define an `` active '' level , representing the strength of synapses connecting currently firing neurons .",
    "the negative response assures that synapses that have been associated with good responses in the past have strengths that are barely less than the active ones , and can readily be activated again by supprerssing the currently active synapses .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section defines the general problem in the context of our ideas .",
    "the model to be studied can be defined for many different geometries . in section iii",
    "we review the layered version of the model @xcite , with a single hidden layer .",
    "it will be shown how the correct connections between inputs are generated , and how new connections are formed when some of the output assignments change . in section",
    "iv we introduce selective punishment of neurons , such that synapses that have never been associated with correct outputs are punished much more severely than synapses that have once participated in the generation of a good output .",
    "it will be demonstrated how this allows for speedy recovery , and hierarchical storage , of old , good patterns . in multi - layered networks , and in random networks , recovery of old patterns takes place in terms of self - organized switches that direct the signal to the correct output . also , the robustness of the circuit towards noise will be demonstrated .",
    "section v shows that the network can easily perform more complicated operations , such as the exclusive - or ( xor ) process , contrary to recent claims in the literature @xcite .",
    "it can even solve the much more complicated parity problem in an efficient way . in the parity problem ,",
    "the system has to decide whether the number of binary 1s among n binary inputs is even or odd . in those problems ,",
    "the system does not have to adapt to new situations , so the success is due to the volatility of the active responses , allowing for efficient search of state space without locking - in at spurious , incorrect , solutions .",
    "in the same section we show how the model can readily learn multi - step tasks , adapt to new multi - step tasks , and store old ones for later use , exactly as for the simple single step problems .",
    "finally section vi contains a few succinct remarks about the most relevant points of this work .",
    "the simple programs that we have constructed can be down - loaded from our web - sites@xcite . for an in - depth discussion of the biological justification , we refer the readers to a recent article @xcite .",
    "schematically , we envision intelligent brain function as follows :    the brain is essentially a network of neurons connected with synapses . some of these neurons are connected to inputs from which they receive information from the outside world @xcite .",
    "the input neurons are connected with other neurons .",
    "if those neurons receive a sufficiently strong signal , they fire , thereby affecting more neurons , and so on .",
    "eventually , an output signal acting on the outside world is generated .",
    "all the neurons that fired in the entire process are `` tagged '' with some chemical for later identification @xcite .",
    "the action on the outside is deemed either good ( satisfactory ) or bad ( not satisfactory ) by the organism .",
    "if the output signal is satisfactory , no further action takes place .",
    "if , on the other hand , the signal is deemed unsatisfactory , a global feedback signal - a hormone , for instance - is fed to all neurons simultaneously .",
    "although the signal is broadcast democratically to all neurons , only the synapses that were previously tagged because they connected firing neurons react to the global signal",
    ". they will be suppressed , whether or not they were actually responsible for the bad result .",
    "later , this may lead to a different routing of the signals , so that a different output signal may be generated .",
    "the process is repeated until a satisfactory outcome is achieved , or , alternatively , until the negative feedback mechanism is turned off , i.e. , the system gives up . in any case , after a while the tagging disappears .",
    "the time - scale for tagging is not related to the time - scale of transmitting signals in the brain but must be related to a time scale of events in the real outside world , such as a realistic time interval between starting to look for food ( opening the refrigerator ) and actually finding food and eating it .",
    "it is measured in minutes and hours rather than in milliseconds .",
    "all of this allows the brain to discover useful responses to inputs , to modify swiftly the synaptic connection when the external situation changes , since the active synapses are usually only barely stronger than some of the inactive ones .",
    "it is important to invoke a mechanism for low activity in order to selectively punish the synapses that are responsible for bad results .",
    "however , in order for the system to be able to recall past successes , which may become relevant again at a later point , it is important to store some memory in the neurons . in accordance with our general philosophy , we do not envision any strengthening of successful synapses . in order to achieve this",
    ", we invoke the principle of selective punishment : _ neurons which have once been associated with successful outputs are punished much less than neurons that have never been involved in good decisions .",
    "_ this yields some robustness for successful patterns with respect to noise , and also helps constructing a tool - box of neuronal patterns stored immediately below the active level , i. e. their inputs are slightly insufficient to cause firing .",
    "this `` forgiveness '' also makes the system stable with respect to random noise - a good synapse that fires inadvertently because of occasional noise is not severely punished .",
    "also , the extra feature of forgiveness allows for simple and efficient learning of sequential patterns , i. e. patterns where several specific consecutive steps have to be taken in order for the output to become successful , and thus avoid punishment .",
    "the correct last steps of will not be forgotten when the system is in the process of learning early steps .    in the beginning of the life of the brain ,",
    "all search must necessarily be arbitrary , and the selective , darwinian , non - instructional nature of the process is evident .",
    "later , however , a tool - box of useful connections has been build up , and most of the activity is associated with previously successful structures - the process appears to be more and more directional , since fewer and fewer mistakes are committed .    roughly speaking , the sole function of the brain is to get rid of irritating negative feedback signals by suppressing firing neurons , in the hope that better results may be achieved that way .",
    "a state of inactivity , or nirvana , is the goal",
    "! a gloomy view of life , indeed !",
    "the process is darwinian , in the sense that unsuitable synapses are killed , or at least temporarily suppressed , until perhaps in a different situation they may play a more role .",
    "there is no direct `` lamarckian '' learning by instruction , but only learning by negative selection .",
    "it is important to distinguish sharply between features that must be hardwired , i. e. genetically generated by the darwinian evolutionary process , and features that have to be self - organized , i. e. , generated by the intrinsic dynamics of the model when subjected to external signals .",
    "biology has to provide a set of more or less randomly connected neurons , and a mechanism by which an output is deemed unsatisfactory , a `` darwinian good selector '' , transmitting a signal to all neurons ( or at least to all neurons in a sector of the brain ) .",
    "it is absurd to speak of meaningful brain processes if the purpose is not defined in advance .",
    "the brain can not learn to define what is good and what is bad . in our model",
    "this is given at the outset .",
    "biology also must provide the chemical or molecular mechanisms by which the individual neurons react to this signal . from there on , the brain is on its own !",
    "there is no room for further ad hoc tinkering by `` model builders '' .",
    "we are allowed to play god , not man !    of course , this is not necessarily a correct , and certainly not a complete , description of the process of self - organized intelligent behaviour in the brain .",
    "however , we are able to construct a specific model that works exactly as described above , so the scenario is at least feasible .",
    "superficially , one would expect that the severe limitations impose by the requirements of self - organization will put us in a straight - jacket and make the performance poor .",
    "surprisingly , it turns out that the resulting process is actually very efficient compared with non - self - organized processes such as back - propagation - in addition to the fact that it executes a dynamical adaptation and memory process not performed by those networks at all .",
    "the amount of activity has to be sparse in order to solve the `` credit ( or rather blame ) assignment '' problem of identifying the neurons that were responsible for the poor result .",
    "if the activity is high , say 50% of all neurons are firing , then a significant fraction of synapses are punished at each time step , precluding any meaningful amount of organization and memory .",
    "one could accomplish this by having a variable threshold , as in the work by alstrom and stassinopoulos@xcite , and by stassinopoulos and bak@xcite . here , we use instead `` extremal dynamics '' , as was introduced by bak and sneppen ( bs)@xcite in a simple model of evolution , where it resulted in a highly adaptive self - organized critical state .",
    "_ at each point in time , only a single neuron , namely the neuron with the largest input , fires .",
    "_    the basic idea is that at a critical state the susceptibility is maximized , which translates into high adaptability . in our model ,",
    "the specific state of the brain depends on the task to be learned , so perhaps it does not generally evolve to a strict critical state with power law avalanches etc . as in the bs model .",
    "nevertheless , it always operate at a very sensitive state which adapts rapidly to changes in the demands imposed by the environment .",
    "this `` winner take all '' dynamics has support in well documented facts in neurophysiology .",
    "the mechanism of lateral inhibition could be the biological mechanism implementing extremal dynamics .",
    "the neuron with the highest input firing rate will first reach its threshold firing potential sending an inhibitory signal to the surrounding , competing neurons , for instance in the same layer , preventing them from firing . at the same time it sends an excitatory signal to other neurons downstream .",
    "in any case , there is no need to invoke a global search procedure , not allowed by the ground rules of self - organization , in order to implement the extremal dynamics .",
    "the extremal dynamics , in conjunction with the negative feedback , allows for efficient credit assignment .    one way of visualizing the process is as follows .",
    "imagine a pile of sand ( or a river network , if you wish ) .",
    "sand is added at designated input sites , for instance at the top row .",
    "tilt the pile until one grain of sand ( extremal dynamics ) is toppling , thereby affecting one or more neighbors .",
    "we then tilt the pile again until another site topples , and so on .",
    "eventually , a grain is falling off the bottom row .",
    "if this is the site that was deemed the correct site for the given input , there are no modifications to the pile . however ,",
    "if the output is incorrect , then a lot of sand is added along the path of falling grains , thereby tending to prevent repeat of the disastrous result . eventually the correct output might be reached .",
    "if the external conditions change , so that another output is correct , the sand , of course , will trickle down as before , but the old output is now deemed inappropriate . since the path had just been successful , only a tiny amount of sand is added along the trail , preserving the path for possible later use . as the process continues , a complex landscape representing the past experiences , and thus representing the memory of the system , will be carved out .",
    "in the simplest layered version , treated in details in ref.@xcite , the setup is as follows ( fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] ) .",
    "there is a number of input cells , an intermediate layer of `` hidden '' neurons , and a layer of output neurons .",
    "each of the input neurons , @xmath1 is connected with each neuron in the middle layer , @xmath2 , with synaptic strength @xmath3 .",
    "each hidden neuron , in turn , is connected with each output neuron , @xmath4 with synaptic strength @xmath5 . initially , all the connection strengths are chosen to be random , say with uniform distribution between 0 and 1 .",
    "each input signal consists ( for the time being ) of a single input neuron firing . for each input signal",
    ", a single output neuron represents the pre - assigned correct output signal , representing the state of the external world .",
    "the network must learn to connect each input with the proper output for any arbitrary set of assignments , called a map .",
    "the map could for instance assign each input neuron @xmath1 to the output neuron with the same label .",
    "( in a realistic situation , the brain could receive a signal that there is some itching at some part of the body , and an output causing the fingers to scratch at the proper place must be generated for the signal to stop ) . at each time step ,",
    "we invoke `` extremal dynamics '' equivalent with a `` winner take all '' strategy : only the neuron connected with the largest synaptic strength to the currently firing neuron @xmath1 will fire at the next time step .",
    "the entire dynamical process goes as follows : + i ) an input neuron @xmath1 is chosen to be active .",
    "+ ii ) the neuron @xmath6 in the middle layer which is connected with the input neuron with the largest @xmath3 is firing .",
    "+ iii ) next , the output neuron @xmath7 with the maximum @xmath8 is firing .",
    "+ iv ) if the output @xmath4 happens to be the desired one , * nothing * is done , + v)otherwise , that is if the output is not correct , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are both depressed by an amount @xmath11 , which could either be a fixed amount , say 1 , or a random number between 0 and 1 .",
    "+ vi ) go to i ) .",
    "another random input neuron is chosen and the process is repeated . + that is all !",
    "the constant @xmath11 is the only parameter of the model , but since only relative values of synaptic strengths are important , it plays no role .",
    "if one finds it un - aesthetic that the values of the connections are always decreasing and never increasing , one could raise the values of all connections such that the value of the largest output synaptic strength for each neuron is @xmath12 .",
    "this has no effect on the dynamics .",
    "we imagine that the synapses @xmath13 and @xmath14 connecting all firing neurons are `` tagged '' by the activity , identifying them for possible subsequent punishment . in real life ,",
    "the tagging must last long enough to ensure that the result of the process is available - the time - scale must match typical processes of the environment rather than firing rates in the brain . if a negative feedback is received all the synapses which were involved and therefore tagged are punished , whether or not they were responsible for the bad result .",
    "this is democratic but , of course , not fair .",
    "we can not imagine a biologically reasonable mechanism that permits identification of synapses for selective punishment ( which could of course be more efficient ) as is assumed in most neural network models .",
    "the use of extremal dynamics solves the crucial credit assignment problem , which has been a stumbling block in previous attempts to model self organized learning , in a simple and elegant way .",
    "eventually , the system learns to wire each input to its correct output counterpart .",
    "the time that it takes is roughly equal to the time that a random search for each input would take . of course",
    ", no general search process could in principle be faster @xcite in the absence of any pre - knowledge of the assignment of output neurons .",
    "it is important to have a large number of neurons in the middle layer in order to prevent the different paths to interfere , and thus destroy connections that have already been correctly learned .",
    "figure [ fig : morebetter ] shows the results from a simulated layered system with 7 input and 7 output nodes , and a variable number of intermediate nodes .",
    "the task was simply to connect each input with one output node ( it does not matter which one ) . in each step",
    "we check if the seven pre - established input - output pairs were learnt and compute over many realizations the average time to learn all input - output connections .",
    "the figure shows how the average learning time decreases with the number of hidden neurons .",
    "more is better !",
    "biologically , creating a large number of more or less identical neurons does not require more genetic information than creating a few , so it is cheap .",
    "on the other hand , the set - up will definitely loose in a storage - capacity beauty contest with orthodox neural networks - that is the price to pay for self - organization !",
    "we are not allowed to engineer non - interfering paths - the system has to find them by itself .    at this point all that we have created is a biologically motivated robot that can perform a random search procedure that stops as soon as the correct result has been found .",
    "while this may not sound like much , we believe that it is a solid starting point for more advanced modelling .",
    "we now subject the model to a new input - output map .",
    "this reflects that the external realities of the organism have changed , so that what was good yesterday is not good any more .",
    "food is to be found elsewhere today , and the system has to adapt .",
    "some input - output connections may still be good , and the synapses connecting them are basically left alone .",
    "however , some outputs which were deemed correct yesterday are deemed wrong today , so the synapses that connected those will immediately be punished .",
    "a search process takes place as before in order to find the new correct connections .",
    "figure  [ fig : wrong ] shows the time sequence of the number of `` wrong '' input - output connections , i. e. , which is a measure of the re - learning time , when the system is subjected to a sequence of different input - output assignments .",
    "for each re - mapping , each input neuron has a new random output neuron assigned to it . in general ,",
    "the re - learning time is roughly proportional to the number of new input - output assignments that have changed , in the limit of a very large number of intermediate neurons .",
    "if the number of intermediate neurons is small , the re - learning time will be longer because of `` path interference '' between the connections . in a real world",
    ", one could imagine that the relative amount of changes that would occur from day to day is small and decreasing , so that the re - learning time becomes progressively lower .",
    "suppose now that after a few new maps , we return to the original input - output assignment .",
    "since the original successful synapses have been weakened , a new pathway has to be found from scratch .",
    "there is no memory of connections that were good in the past .",
    "the network can learn and adapt , but it can not remember responses that were good in the past . in sections 4 and 6 we shall introduce a simple remedy for that fundamental problem , which does not violate our basic philosophy of having no positive feedback .      the set - up discussed above can trivially be generalized to include more intermediate layers .",
    "the case of multi - layers of neurons that are not fully connected with the neurons in the next layer is depicted in figure 1b .",
    "each neuron in the layer connects forward to three others in the next layer .",
    "the network operates in a very similar way : a firing neuron in one layer causes firing of the neuron with the largest connection to that neuron in the subsequent layer and so on , starting with the input neuron at the bottom . only when the signal reaches the top output layer will all synapses in the firing chain be punished , by decreasing their strength by an amount @xmath11 as before , if need be .",
    "interestingly , the learning time _ does not _ increase as the number of layers increases .",
    "this is due to the `` extremal dynamics '' causing the speedy formation of robust `` wires '' .",
    "in contrast , the learning time for back - propagation networks grows exponentially with the number of layers -this is one reason that one rarely sees backprop networks with more than one hidden layer .",
    "in addition to layered networks , one can study the process in a random network , which may represent an actual biological system better .",
    "consider an architecture where each of @xmath15 neuron is arbitrarily connected to a number @xmath16 of other neurons with synaptic strengths @xmath17 .",
    "a number of neurons ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) are arbitrarily selected as input and output neurons , respectively .",
    "again , output neurons are arbitrarily assigned to each input neuron .",
    "initially , a single input neuron is firing . using extremal dynamics , the neuron that is connected with the input neuron with the largest strength is then firing , and so on .",
    "if after a maximum number of firing events @xmath20 the correct output neuron has not been reached , all the synapses in the string of firing neurons are punished as before .",
    "summarizing , the entire dynamical process is as follows : + i ) a single input neuron is chosen .",
    "+ ii ) this neuron is connected randomly with several others , and the one which is connected with the largest synaptic strength fires .",
    "the procedure is repeated a prescribed maximum number of times @xmath20 , thereby creating and labelling a chain of firing neurons .",
    "+ iii ) if , during that process , the correct output has not been reached , each synapse in the entire chain of firings is depressed an amount @xmath11 .",
    "+ iv ) if the correct output is achieved , there is no plastic modification of the neurons that fired .",
    "go to i ) + a system with @xmath21 , @xmath22 behaves like the layered structure presented above ( and is actually the one shown in the figure .",
    "this illustrates the striking development of an organized network structure even in the case where all initial connections are absolutely uncorrelated .",
    "the model creates wires connecting the correct outputs with the inputs , using the intermediate neurons as stepping stones .",
    "we observed that there was not much memory left the second time around , when an old assignment map was re - employed - the task had to be re - learned from scratch .",
    "this turns out to be much more than a nuisance , in particular when the task was complicated , like in the case of a random network with many intermediate neurons , where the search became slow .",
    "we would like there to be some memory left from previous successful experiences , so that the earlier efforts would not be completely wasted .",
    "there is an analogous situation in the immune system , where the lymphocytes can recognize an invader faster the second time around .",
    "the location and activation of memory in biological systems is an important , but largely unresolved problem .",
    "speaking about the immune system , it has in fact been suggested in a series of remarkable papers by polly matzinger that the immune system is only activated in the presence of `` danger '' @xcite .",
    "this is the equivalent of our learning by mistakes .",
    "in fact , matzinger realizes that the identification of danger has to be pre - programmed in the innate immune system , and must have evolved on a biological time scale- this is the equivalent of our `` darwinian good '' ( or rather `` bad '' , or `` danger '' selector or indicator that decides if the organism is in a satisfactory state .",
    "it turns out @xcite that one single modification to the rules describedabove allows for some fundamental improvements of the system s ability to recognize old patterns : + iii a ) when the output is wrong , a firing synapse that has at least once been successful is punished much less than a synapse that has never been successful . + for instance , the punishment of the `` good '' synapse could be of the order of @xmath23 , compared with a depression of order unity for a `` bad '' synapse .",
    "the neuron has earned some forgiveness due to its past good performance .",
    "biologically , we envision that a neuron that does not receive a global feedback signal after firing , relaxes its susceptibility to a subsequent negative feedback signal by some chemical mechanism .",
    "it is important to realize that the synapse `` knows '' that it has been successful by the fact that it was not punished , so no non - local information is invoked .",
    "note that we have not , and will not , include any positive hebbian enforcement in order to implement memory in the system - only reduced punishment .",
    "we have applied this update scheme to both the layered and the random version of the model . for the random model ,",
    "we choose 200 intermediate neurons , plus 5 designated input neurons and 5 output neurons .",
    "each neuron was connected randomly with 10 other neurons .",
    "first , we arbitrarily assigned a correct output to each input , and ran the algorithm above , until the map had been learned .",
    "after unsuccessful firings , punishment was applied ; an amount of 0.001 to previously successful neurons , and a random number between 0 and 1 for those that had never been successful .",
    "then we arbitrarily changed one input - output assignment , and repeated the learning scheme .",
    "a new random reassignment of a single input - output pair was introduced , and so on .    in the beginning , the learning time is large , corresponding roughly to the time for a random search for each connection .",
    "new connections have to be discovered at each input - output assignment . however ,",
    "after several switches , the time for adaptation becomes much shorter , of the order of a few time steps .",
    "figure [ fig : learntimes ] shows the time for adaptation for hundreds of consecutive input - output reassignments .",
    "the process becomes extremely fast compared with the initial learning time .",
    "typically , the learning time is only 0 - 10 steps , compared with hundreds or thousands of steps in the initial learning phase .",
    "this is because any `` new '' input - output assignment is not really new , but has been imposed on the system before .",
    "the entire process , in one particular run with 1000 adaptations , involved a total of only 38 neurons out of 200 intermediate neurons to create all possible input - output connections , and thus all possible maps .    in order to understand this , it is useful to introduce the concept of the  active level \" , which is simply the strength of the strongest synaptic output connection from the neuron which has just been selected by the extreme dynamics . for simplicity , and without changing the firing pattern whatsoever",
    ", we can normalize this strength to unity .",
    "the strengths of the other output synapses are thus below the active level . whenever a previously successful input - output connection is deemed unsuccessful , the synapses are punished slightly , according to rule iii a ) , only until the point where a _",
    "single _ synapse in the firing chain is suppressed slightly below the active level defined by the extremal dynamics , thus barely breaking the input - output connection .",
    "thus , connections that have been good in the past are located very close to the active level , and can readily be brought back to life again , by suppression of firing neurons at the active level if need be .",
    "figure [ fig : landscapea ] shows the synaptic landscape after several re - learning events for a small system with 3 inputs , 3 outputs , and 20 neurons , each connected with 5 other neurons .",
    "the arrow indicates a synapse at the active level , i. e. , a synapse that would lead to firing if its input neuron were firing .",
    "altogether , there are 7 active synapses for that particular simulation , representing the correct learning of the current map .",
    "note that there are many synaptic strengths just below the active level .",
    "the memory of past successes is located in those synapses !    the single synapse that broke the input output connection serves as a self - organized switch , redirecting the firing pattern from one neuron chain to another , and consequently from one output to another .",
    "the adaptation process takes place by employing these self - organized switches , playing the roles of `` hub neurons '' , assuring that the correct output is reached .",
    "thus , when an input - output connection turns unsuccessful , all the neurons in the firing chain are suppressed slightly , and it is likely that an old successful connection re - appear at the active level .",
    "perhaps that connection is also unsuccessful , and will be suppressed , and another previously successful connection may appear at the active level .",
    "the system sifts through old successful connections in order to look for new ones .    every now and then",
    ", there is some path interference , and re - learning takes longer time , indicated by the rare glitches of long adaptation times in figure [ fig : learntimes ] .",
    "also , now and then previously unused synapses interfere , since the strength of the successful synapses slowly becomes lower and lower .",
    "thus even when successful patterns between all possible input - output pairs have been established , the process of adaptation now and then changes the paths of the connections .    perhaps this mimics the process of thinking :    _ `` thinking '' is the process , where unsuccessful neuronal patterns are suppressed by some `` hormonal '' feedback mechanism , allowing old successful patterns to emerge .",
    "the brain sifts through old solutions until , perhaps , a good pattern emerges , and the process stops .",
    "if no successful pattern emerges , the brain panics : it has to search more or less randomly in order to establish a new , correct input - output connection .",
    "_    the input patterns do not change during the thinking process : one can think with closed eyes .",
    "figure [ fig : paths]a shows the entire part of the network which is involved with a single input neuron , allowing it to connect with all possible outputs .",
    "the full line indicates synapses at the active level , connecting the input with the correct output .",
    "the broken lines indicate synapses that connect the input with other outputs .",
    "they are located just below the active level .",
    "the neurons marked by an asterisk are switches , and are responsible for redirecting the flow .",
    "similarly , fig .",
    "[ fig : paths]b shows all the synapses connecting a single output with all possible inputs . the neurons with the asterisks are `` hub neurons '' , directing several inputs to a common output .",
    "once such neuron is firing , the output is recognized , correctly or incorrectly .",
    "a total of only 5 intermediate neurons are involved in connecting the output with all possible inputs .",
    "note that short - term and long - term memories are not located at , or ever relocated to , different locations .",
    "they are represented by synapses that are more or less suppressed relative to the currently active level selected by the process of extremal dynamics , and can be reactivated through self - organized switches as described above .",
    "the system exhibits aging at a large time scale : eventually all or most of the neurons will have been successful at one point or another , and the ability to selectively memorize good pattern disappears .",
    "the process is not stationary .",
    "if one does not like that , one can let the neurons die , and replaced by fresh neurons with random connections at a small rate .",
    "the death of neurons causes longer adaptation times now and then since new synaptic connections have to be located .",
    "it is also interesting to consider the effect of noise .",
    "suppose that a small noise @xmath15 , randomly distributed in the interval @xmath24 , is added to the signal sent to the neurons .",
    "this may cause an occasional wrong output signal , triggered by synapses with strengths @xmath25 that were close to that of the correct one , i. e. the one that would be at the active level in the absence of noise .",
    "however , those synapses will now be suppressed , since they lead to an incorrect result . after a while",
    ", there will be no incorrect synapses @xmath25 left , such that the addition of the noise can cause it to exceed the strength of the correct synapse @xmath9 , so no further modifications will take place , and the input - output connections will be perfect from then on .",
    "the system deals automatically with noise !",
    "_ figure [ fig : landscapeb ] shows all the input - output connections for one input neuron in a simulation with three input neurons , three output neurons , and a total of 50 neurons each connected with 5 neurons .",
    "the noise level is 0.02 , and the punishment of previously successful neurons is 0.002 .",
    "the numbers are the strengths of the synapses .",
    "note that the incorrect synapses connected with the switches are suppressed by a gap of at least 0.02 - the level of the noise - below the correct ones .",
    "note also that some of the incorrect synapses not connected with switches are much less suppressed .",
    "they are cut - off by switches elsewhere and need not be suppressed in order to have the signal directed to the correct output .",
    "the price to be paid in order to have perfect learning with noise is that adaptation to new patterns takes longer , because the active synapses have to be suppressed further to give way for new synapses .",
    "figure [ fig : noise ] shows the learning time for 700 successive re - mappings , as in fig .   [ fig : learntimes ] , but with noise added .",
    "note that indeed adaptation is much slower .",
    "so far we have considered only simple input - output mappings where only a single input neuron was activated . however , it is quite straightforward to consider more complicated patterns where several input neurons are firing at the same time . in the case of the layered network ,",
    "we simply modify the rule ii ) above for the selection of the firing neuron in the second layer as follows :",
    "+ ii b ) the neuron @xmath6 in the middle layer for which the sum of the synaptic connections @xmath3 with the active input neurons @xmath1 is maximum is firing . + for the random network one would modify the rule for the firing of the first intermediate neuron similarly .",
    "since the hey - days of minsky and papert@xcite who demonstrated that only linearly separable functions can be represented by simple -one layer- perceptrons , the ability to perform the exclusive - or ( xor ) operation has been considered a litmus test for the performance of any neural network .",
    "how does our network measure up to the test ? following klemm et al .",
    "@xcite we choose to include three input neurons , two of them representing the input bits for which we wish to perform the xor operation , and a third input neuron which is always active .",
    "this bias assures that there is a non - zero input even when the response to the 00 bits is considered .",
    "the two possible outputs for the xor operation determines that the network have two output neurons .",
    "the inputs are represented by a string of @xmath26 binary units @xmath27 , @xmath28 . as explained in section 3 , neurons are connected by weights @xmath29 from each input ( @xmath2 ) to each hidden ( @xmath1 ) unit and from each hidden unit to each output(@xmath4 ) unit .",
    "the dynamics of the network is defined by the following steps .",
    "one stimulus is randomly selected out of the four possible ( i.e.,001,101,011,111 ) and applied to @xmath30 .",
    "each hidden node @xmath2 then receives a weighted input @xmath31 .",
    "the state is chosen according to the winner - take - all rule i.e. , the @xmath6 neuron with the largest @xmath32 fires ( i. e. , @xmath33 .",
    "since there is only one active intermediate neuron , the output neuron is chosen as before to be the one connected with that neuron by the largest strength @xmath34 .",
    "adaptation to changing tasks is not of interest here , so we choose to simulate the simplest algorithm in section 3 without any selective punishment ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xora ] , networks with the minimum number of intermediate neurons ( three for this problem ) are able to solve the task in as few as tens of presentations . of course , networks with larger middle layers learn significantly faster , up to an asymptotic limit which for this problem is reached for about 20 nodes .    even in the present of noise , the tolerant version of the model presented above , and in our previous paper @xcite",
    "allows for perfect , but slightly slower learning .",
    "klemm et al introduced forgiveness in a slightly different , and much more elaborate way , by allowing the synapses a small number of mistakes before punishment .",
    "we do not see the advantage of this ad hoc scheme over our simpler original version , which also appear to be more feasible from a biological point of view .",
    "indeed much harder problems of the same class as the xor , can be learned by our network without any modification .",
    "xor belongs to the `` parity '' class of problem , where for a string of arbitrary length @xmath35 there are @xmath36 realizations composed of all different combinations of 0 and 1 s . in order to learn to solve the parity problem",
    "the system must be able to selectively respond to all the strings with odd ( or even ) number of 1 s ( or zeros ) .",
    "the xor function is the simplest case with @xmath37 .",
    "we used the same network as for the xor problem , but now with increasing @xmath35 up to string lengths of 6 .",
    "for all cases we chose a relatively large intermediate layer with 3000 neurons .",
    "figure[fig : xorb ] shows the results of these simulations . in panel",
    "a the mean error ( calculated as in klemm et al . for consistency ) is the ratio between those realizations which have learned the complete task and those that have not , as a function of time . for each n ,",
    "a total of 1024 realizations was simulated , each one initiated from a different random configuration of weights .",
    "notice that the time axis ( for presentation purposes ) is in logarithmic scale .",
    "at least for the sizes explored here , the network solves larger problems following not very explosive power - law scaling relationship .",
    "panel b of fig .",
    "[ fig : xorb ] shows that learning time scales with problem size with an exponent @xmath38 . in conclusion",
    ", the nonlinearity does not appear to introduce additional fundamental problems into our scheme .",
    "the general focus of most neural network studies has been on the ability of the network to generalize , i.e. , to distinguish between classes of inputs requiring the same output . in general , the task of assigning an output to an input which has not been seen before is mathematically ill - defined , since in principle any arbitrary collection of inputs might be assigned to the same output .",
    "practically , one would like to map `` similar '' inputs to the same output ; again `` similar '' is ill - defined .",
    "we believe that similarity is best defined in the context of ( biological ) utility : similar inputs are by definition inputs requiring the same reaction ( output ) on order to be successful ( this is circular , of course ) . for a frog , things that fly",
    "requires it to stick its tongue out in the direction of the flying object , so all things that fly might be considered similar ; there is not much need for the frog to bother with things that do nt fly . actually , a frog can only react to things that move as demonstrated in the classical paper by lettvin , maturana , mcculloch and pitts @xcite almost half a century ago .",
    "roughly , the generalization problem can be reduced to the problem of identifying useful ( or dangerous ) features in the input that have consequences for the action that should be taken .",
    "so how does our network learn to identify useful features in the input ?",
    "suppose ( fig .",
    "[ fig : generalize ] ) , that we present two different inputs to , for instance , the random network , one where input neurons @xmath12 and @xmath39 are firing , and another one where inputs @xmath39 and @xmath40 are firing .",
    "consider the two cases a ) where the output neuron for the two inputs should be the same , and b ) where the assigned outputs are different .    in the case",
    "where the outputs should be different , say , @xmath12 , and @xmath39 , respectively the algorithm solves the problem by connecting the input @xmath12 to @xmath12 and the input @xmath40 to the neuron @xmath39 through different intermediate neurons , while ignoring the input @xmath39 .",
    "the brain identifies features in the input that are _ different_. the irrelevant feature @xmath39 is not even `` seen '' by our brain , since it have no internal representation in the form of firing intermediate neurons . in the case where the assigned outputs for the two inputs are the same , say @xmath12 , the problem is solved by connecting the common input neuron @xmath12 with the output neuron with a single string of synaptic connections .",
    "the network identifies a feature that is _ the same _ for the two inputs , while ignoring the irrelevant outputs @xmath12 and @xmath40 , that are simply not registering in the brain.in a simulation , it was imposed that when inputs @xmath12 or @xmath40 were active without @xmath39 being active , success was achieved only if the output was not @xmath12 : the frog should not try to eat non - flying objects .",
    "this mechanism can supposedly be generalized to more complicated situations : depending on the task at hand , the brain identifies useful features that allows it to distinguish , or not to distinguish ( generalize ) between inputs .",
    "suppose the system is subsequently presented to a pattern that in addition to the input neurons above includes more firing neurons . in case",
    "the additional neurons are irrelevant for the outcome , the system will take advantage of the connections that have already been created and ignore the additional inputs . if some of the new inputs are relevant , in the sense that a different output is required , further learning involving the new inputs will take place in order to allow the system to discriminate between outputs .",
    "we envision that this process of finer and finer discrimination between input classes allows for better and better generalization of inputs requiring identical outputs .",
    "the important observation to keep in mind is that the concept of generalization is intimately connected with the desired function , and can not be pre - designed .",
    "we feel that , for instance with respect to theories of vision , there is an undue emphasis on constructing general pattern detection devises that are not based on the nature of the specific problem at hand . whether edges , angles , contrasts , or whatever are the important feature must be learned , not hardwired .",
    "in general , the brain has to perform several successive tasks in order to achieve a successful result .",
    "for instance , in a game of chess or backgammon , the reward ( or punishment ) only takes place after the completion of several steps .",
    "the system can not `` benefit '' from immediate punishment following trivial intermediate steps , no matter how much the bad decisions contributed to the final poor result .",
    "consider for simplicity a set - up where the system has to learn to present four successive outputs , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , following a single firing input neuron , 1 .",
    "in general , the output decision at any intermediate step will affect the input at the next step .",
    "suppose , for instance that in order to get from one place to another in a city starting at point 1 , one first has to choose road 1 to get to point 2 , and then road 2 to go to point 3 , and so on .",
    "thus , the output represents the point reached by the action , which is then seen by the system and represents the following input .",
    "we represent this by feeding the output signal to the input at the next step .",
    "thus , if output number 5 fires at an intermediate step , input neuron @xmath41 will fire at the next step : this is the outer worlds reaction to our action .",
    "we will facilitate the learning process by presenting the system not only with the final problem , but also with the simpler intermediate problems : we randomly select an input neuron 1 to 4 . if the neuron 4 is selected , the output neuron 4 must respond . otherwise the firing neurons are punished",
    ". if the input neuron 3 is selected , the output neuron 3 must first fire .",
    "this creates an input signal at input neuron 4 .",
    "then the output neuron 4 must fire . for any other combination ,",
    "all the synapses participating in the two step operation are punished . in case",
    "the input 2 is presented , output neuron 2 must first fire , then output neuron 3 , and finally output neuron 4 must fire , otherwise all synapses connecting firing neurons in the three step process are punished . when the input 1 is presented , the four output neurons must fire in the correct sequence .",
    "of course , we never evaluate or punish intermediate successes !    for this to work properly , it is essential to employ the selective punishment scheme where neurons that have once participated in correct sequences are punished less than neurons that have never been successful , in order for the system to remember partially correct end games learned in the past .",
    "in one typical run , we choose a layered geometry with 10 inputs , 10 outputs , and 20 intermediate neurons .",
    "after 4 time steps , the last step @xmath42 was learned for the first time . after 35 time steps , the sequence @xmath43 was also learned , after 57 steps the sequence @xmath44 was learned , and finally , after 67 steps the entire sequence had been learned .",
    "these results are typical .",
    "the brain learned the steps backwards , which , after all , is the only logical way of doing it . in chess , one has to learn that capturing the king is essential before the intermediate steps acquire any meaning !    in order to imitate a changing environment ,",
    "we may reassign one or more of the outputs to fire in the sequence . as in the previous problems",
    ", the system will keep the parts that were correct , and learn the new segments .",
    "older sequences can be swiftly recalled .",
    "finally we added uniform random noise of order @xmath45 to the outputs ; this extended the learning time in the run above to 193 time steps .",
    "the employment of the simple principles produces a self - organized , robust and simple , biologically plausible model of learning .",
    "it is , however , important to keep in mind in which contexts these ideas do apply and in which they do not .",
    "the model discussed is supposed to represent a mechanism for biological learning , that a hypothetical organism could use in order to solve some of the tasks that must be carried out in order to secure its survival . on the other hand",
    "the model is not supposed to solve optimally any problem - real brains are not very good at that either .",
    "it seems illogical to seek to model brain function by constructing contraptions that can perform tasks that real brains , such as ours , are quite poor at , such as solving the travelling salesman problem .",
    "the mechanism that we described is not intended to be optimal , just sufficient for survival .",
    "extremal dynamics in the activity followed eventually by depression of only the active synapses results in preserving good synapses for a given job .",
    "in contrast to other learning schemes , the efficiency also scales as one should expect from biology : bigger networks solve a given problem more efficiently than smaller networks . and",
    "all of this is obtained without having to specify the network s structure - the same principle works well in randomly connected , lattices or layered networks .    in summary , the simple action of choosing the strongest and depressing the inadequate synapses leads to a permanent counter - balancing which can be analogous to a critical state in the sense that all states in the system are barely stable , or `` minimally '' stable using the jargon of ref .",
    "this peculiar meta - stability prevents the system from stagnating by locking into a single ( addictive ) configuration from which it can be difficult to escape when novel conditions arise .",
    "this feature provides for flexible learning and un - learning , without having to specifically include an ad - hoc forgetting mechanism - it is already embedded as an integrated dynamical property of the system . when combined with selective punishment , the system can build - up a history - dependent tool box of responses that can be employed again in the future .",
    "un - learning and flexible learning are ubiquitous features of animal learning as discussed recently by wise and murray@xcite .",
