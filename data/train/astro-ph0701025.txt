    "white dwarfs ( wds ) can be associated with three types of x - ray sources : ( 1 ) photospheric x - ray emission from the wd itself , ( 2 ) accretion of material from a close binary companion , as in cataclysmic variables , and ( 3 ) coronal x - ray emission from a late - type binary companion , such as dme stars .",
    "the latter two types of sources originate from wds in binary systems and commonly show x - ray emission at 1 kev .",
    "in contrast , the photospheric x - ray emission from wds is much softer , well below 0.5 kev .",
    "no hard x - ray emission is expected from single wds .",
    "inspired by the hard x - ray emission from wd2226@xmath1210 , the central star of the helix nebula @xcite , we made a systematic search for hard x - ray emission from wds using the wd catalog compiled by @xcite and the second _ rosat _ source catalogs of pointed observations with the pspc with and without the boron filter ( 2rxf and 2rxp ) . among the 124 x - ray sources that are found coincident with wds ,",
    "22 show hard x - ray emission peaking near 0.8 - 0.9 kev . after identifying binary systems and extraneous x - ray sources , we find two wds , kpd0005 + 5106 (= wd0005 + 511 ) and pg1159 (= wd1159@xmath1034 ) , that are associated with hard x - ray emission and appear to be single @xcite .    the hard x - ray emission from these three apparently single wds",
    "is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) images in the 0.62.4 kev energy band show clearly point sources coincident with the wds , and the pspc spectra show distinct emission near 1 kev .",
    "kpd0005 + 5106 was detected in the _ rosat _ all sky survey , and the analysis of its soft x - ray emission led to the suggestion of a ( 23)@xmath210@xmath3 k corona @xcite .",
    "the 1 kev hard x - ray emission was detected in a pointed _ rosat _ pspc observation made with the boron filter @xcite .",
    "kpd0005 + 5106 has been observed with the _ chandra _ low energy transmission grating spectrometer .",
    "this observation detected only the soft x - ray emission , and the spectrum can be described well by non - lte photospheric models that contain some fe , but the models can not reproduce the 1 kev emission detected by _",
    "rosat _ @xcite .",
    "kpd0005 + 5106 does not have any known companion .",
    "its photometric measurements ( @xmath4=13.32 , @xmath5=13.93 , @xmath6=14.13 , @xmath7=14.18 ) do not show an ir excess @xcite . the lack of ir excess and the presence of hard x - ray emission together place even more stringent constraints against the existence of a late - type companion @xcite .",
    "the _ rosat _ pspc count rate , 0.005@xmath80.001 counts s@xmath9 in the 0.42.0 kev band with the boron filter is estimated to correspond to roughly an x - ray luminosity of @xmath10 = ( 0.44)@xmath210@xmath11 ergs s@xmath9 . if this hard x - ray emission originates from the corona of a late - type companion with a canonical @xmath12 = 10@xmath1310@xmath14 , this companion should have @xmath7=1112 , but this is much brighter than the observed @xmath7=14.18 .",
    "therefore , the hard x - rays of kpd0005 + 5106 can not originate from the corona of a late - type companion .",
    "kpd0005 + 5106 had numerous high - dispersion spectroscopic observations . using _",
    "observations , @xcite reported average velocities of the photospheric nv and civ lines ( 36.2 km  s@xmath9 ) , circumstellar nv , siiv , and civ lines ( @xmath16.2 km  s@xmath9 ) , and interstellar ni , cii , siii , and sii lines ( @xmath17.5 km  s@xmath9 ) . recently , using _ fuse _ observations , @xcite discovered an ovi - emitting nebula around kpd0005 + 5106 .",
    "@xcite have analyzed the nebular environment of kpd0005 + 5106 , using radial velocities of all lines and spatial distributions of the emission lines .",
    "they show that kpd0005 + 5106 resides in a photoionized interstellar hii region with a density of @xmath15 h - atom cm@xmath13 .",
    "this interstellar hii region is responsible for the high - ionization  circumstellar \" lines reported by @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is no evidence of a circumstellar nebula or wind outflow from kpd0005 + 5106 .    while the _ rosat _ pspc resolution can not exclude the possibility of a chance superposition of a background agn x - ray source near kpd0005 + 5106 , the stellar oviii emission @xcite places a strong constraint on the location of the hard x - ray source .",
    "the oviii line is emitted from recombinations of o@xmath17 . as the excitation potential of o@xmath17 is 871 ev ,",
    "energetic photons are needed ; thus , the hard x - ray source must be local to kpd0005 + 5106 .",
    "the origin of the hard x - ray emission from kpd0005 + 5106 is most puzzling .",
    "pg1159 is a bright soft x - ray source .",
    "its hard x - ray emission was detected in two independent _ rosat _ pspc observations , rp701202n00 ( 13.6 ks ) without the boron filter and rf200430n00 ( 9.8 ks ) with the boron filter .",
    "each observation detected 12@xmath83 counts in the 0.62.4 kev band .",
    "pg1159 does not have any known companion .",
    "its photometric measurements ( @xmath4=14.89 , @xmath5=15.58 , @xmath6=15.87 , @xmath7=15.78 ) do not show an ir excess @xcite .",
    "pg1159 is a pulsator ; therefore , a stellar companion can be definitively ruled out by high - precision measurements of its pulsation modes @xcite .",
    "both the presence of hard x - ray emission and the single - star status of pg1159 are well established .",
    "the point spread function of the _ rosat _ pspc has a fwhm of 30@xmath1840@xmath18 .",
    "both the spectral shape and the spatial coincidence between the hard x - ray source and pg1159 can be improved by a deep _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "wd2226@xmath1210 is the central star of the helix nebula .",
    "chandra _ acis - s observations show a point x - ray source coincident with the star within 05 .",
    "the acis spectrum can be fitted by a thin plasma emission model with a temperature of ( 78)@xmath210@xmath19 k and an x - ray luminosity of @xmath10 = 3@xmath210@xmath20 ergs  s@xmath9 in the 0.32.0 kev range .",
    "these x - ray properties and the 25% decline of the x - ray luminosity during the period of _ chandra _ observation prompted @xcite to suggest the existence of a dme companion .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the observed variability of the stellar h@xmath21 emission line profile @xcite .",
    "an _ hst _ search for companions of wd2226@xmath1210 has yielded null results , indicating that no companion earlier than m5 exists @xcite .",
    "if there is a late type companion , its luminosity has to be lower than 4.2@xmath210@xmath22 ergs  s@xmath9 .",
    "if this hypothetical companion is responsible for the hard x - ray emission , its @xmath12 is @xmath237@xmath210@xmath13 , much higher than the canonical 10@xmath1410@xmath13 .",
    "it is uncertain whether wd2226@xmath1210 indeed has a late - type dme companion .",
    "it is also puzzling how a late - type dme star can have such a high @xmath12 .",
    "excess emission at near - ir wavelengths is often used to diagnose the presence of a late - type companion .",
    "the helix central star has no near - ir excess ; however , a mid - ir excess is revealed by observations made with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "irac at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath24 m and mips at 24 , 70 , and 160 @xmath24 m @xcite .",
    "the central star , wd2226@xmath1210 , is detected at all except the 160 @xmath24 m mips band .",
    "figure 2 presents the _ spitzer _ images of the helix at 3.6 , 8.0 , 24 , and 70 @xmath24 m .",
    "the 24 @xmath24 m band shows a prominent point - like source at the central wd , superposed on an extended region of diffuse emission .",
    "a _ spitzer _",
    "irs spectrum of the diffuse emission region shows that the [ oiv ] 25.89 @xmath24 m line is the major contributor to the flux in the 24 @xmath24 m band ( see figure 3a ) .",
    "no irs spectrum of the central point - like source is available .    to determine whether the central point - like source is also dominated by the [ oiv ] 25.89 @xmath24 m line emission in the 24 @xmath24 m band , we compare the 24 @xmath24 m image with a heii @xmath254686 image .",
    "the excitation potential of oiv , 54.9 ev , is similar to the ionization potential of heii , 54.4 ev ; therefore , regions emitting [ oiv ] 25.89 @xmath24 m line should emit heii @xmath254686 line , too .",
    "the heii image of the helix nebula @xcite shows a central diffuse emission region similar to that seen at 24 @xmath24 m , but not a point - like central source .",
    "thus , we conclude that the [ oiv ] line does not contribute to the central point - like source in the 24 @xmath24 m band .",
    "it is possible that the central source is dominated by the [ nev ] 24.32 @xmath24 m line in the 24 @xmath24 m band , then the emission in the 70 @xmath24 m band would have to be dominated by high - ionization lines , but the 70 @xmath24 m band contains only low - ionization lines .",
    "thus , it is most likely that the central point - like source detected in the mips 24 and 70 @xmath24 m bands is a continuum source",
    ".    the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of wd2226@xmath1210 is presented in figure 3b .",
    "the optical and near - ir emission follows the rayleigh - jeans tail , but the mid - ir emission rises sharply at 24 @xmath24 m and remains high at 70 @xmath24 m .",
    "this mid - infrared excess is consistent with a 100130 k blackbody emitter .",
    "no stars have such a low temperature .",
    "if this ir excess emission is re - processed stellar emission , the emitting material must be several tens of au from wd2226@xmath1210 , which has a stellar effective temperature of @xmath0110,000 k. for a distance of 210  pc @xcite , the 24 @xmath24 m band luminosity , @xmath26 ergs  s@xmath9 , requires an emitting area of almost 10 au@xmath27 .",
    "the temperature and distribution of the emitting material suggest that it is a dust disk .",
    "dusk disks have been observed around wds , such as gd362 and g29 - 38 @xcite , but these dust disks are at smaller distances from their central wds and have higher temperatures .",
    "hard x - ray emission from the three apparently single wds , kpd0005 + 5106 , pg1159 , and wd2226@xmath1210 , is puzzling .",
    "the discovery of a dust disk around wd2226@xmath1210 opens up the possibility that the accretion of disk material gives rise to the hard x - ray emission .",
    "the detailed process is still unknown .",
    "high - quality x - ray observations of kpd0005 + 5106 and pg1159 can provide spectral and temporal properties of their hard x - rays and shed light on the origin of the x - ray emission .",
    "mid - ir observations of these two wds are also needed to see whether they also have a dust disk .",
