    "the wounded nucleon model  @xcite and its extensions  @xcite have become the basic tool in an analysis of relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "this is essentially the bare framework of the traditional glauber model  @xcite , with all the quantum mechanics reduced to its simplest form  @xcite .",
    "the original glauber model develops into the purely classical , geometric picture used for present - day data analysis .",
    "the glauber monte carlo calculations have been used for description of the bulk properties of the data  @xcite .    in the wounded nucleon model",
    "the basic entity is the nucleon - nucleon collision profile , @xmath0 , defined by the probability density @xmath1 of inelastic nucleon - nucleon collision at the impact parameter @xmath2 .",
    "it is normalized to the total inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section : @xmath3 in most glauber monte carlo codes it is assumed that @xmath0 is a simple step function @xmath4 with @xmath5 and probability density distribution @xmath6 .",
    "the importance of the shape of the nucleon - nucleon collision profile was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . following  @xcite , where the cern isr experimental data for pp cross section were properly parametrized with a combination of gaussians , in ref .",
    "@xcite the profile function was proposed in the form @xmath7 with parameter @xmath8 .    in this work",
    "we demonstrate the convenient way to model hadronic collision profile is by introducing the cross section fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to discuss a particular model of cross section fluctuations and its impact on measurements .",
    "the glauber formalism offers a convenient scheme for the calculation of various observables measured in the hadron - nucleus ( or nucleus - nucleus ) scattering at high energies such as the total and elastic cross sections @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the nuclear nuclear impact parameter elastic amplitude .",
    "the origin of the cross section fluctuations can be traced down to the fact that hadrons have internal degrees of freedom ( color - carrying quarks and gluons ) and can therefore collide in different internal configurations resulting in different cross sections  @xcite .",
    "considering the incoming wave as a coherent superposition of eigenstates of the scattering operator , each eigenstate interacts with the target with its own cross section  @xcite .",
    "since , in general , these cross sections ( eigenvalues ) are different , the final state contains not only the initial particle but also other states .",
    "it is important to note that the formalism of scattering eigenstates is based on the assumption that one can represent scattering as a superposition of the components with different interaction strengths .",
    "the use of this assumption and the completeness of the set of scattering states allows to obtain compact formulas . introducing the probability of interaction with a given cross section @xmath11 , @xmath12 ,",
    "the expressions for the total and elastic hadron - nucleus cross sections become @xmath13 at small impact parameters and large @xmath11 , the nuclear scattering amplitude saturates , @xmath14 , and becomes independent of @xmath11 .",
    "therefore cross section fluctuations indicate how close to the black body limit regime one is . in equations  ( [ eq6 ] )",
    "the scattering amplitude @xmath15 depends on the eigenvalue @xmath11 rather than on the total cross section @xmath16 , and the cross sections are sensitive not only to the first moment of @xmath12 , @xmath17 but also to the higher moments @xmath18 .",
    "the distribution over cross sections @xmath12 has the following properties : @xmath19 where @xmath20 measures the broadness of cross section fluctuations around the average value .    as a first estimate a gaussian distribution modified to give the correct asymptotic behavior for @xmath21",
    "was considered  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the parameters , and @xmath25 is the normalization constant .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that cross section fluctuations lead to nonexponential attenuation of hadrons .",
    "as was shown  @xcite fluctuations given by the gamma distribution @xmath26 with @xmath27 being euler gamma function inevitably lead to the quasi power - law distribution of hadron free path @xmath28^{1/\\omega } \\label{eq12}\\ ] ] characterized by the mean free path @xmath29 and the parameter @xmath30 reflecting the amount of fluctuations of cross section .",
    "notice , that asymptotically ( for @xmath31 ) the gamma distribution ( [ eq11 ] ) becomes delta function @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "fluctuation of cross section , given by equation  ( [ eq11 ] ) , results geometrically in fluctuations of nucleon radius . in the picture of hard - sphere approximation ,",
    "the radius @xmath34 fluctuate as @xmath35 equations  ( [ eq1 ] ) and  ( [ eq8 ] ) result in equalities : @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 finally we can write @xmath39 integrating distribution  ( [ eq11 ] ) with @xmath40 we have @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the incomplete gamma function .    profile function ( [ eq19 ] ) ranges from the hard sphere @xmath43 to the gaussian shape @xmath44 non - physical shapes for @xmath45 ( large fluctuations in comparison with experimentally expected maximal values @xmath46 )",
    "@xcite are also possible in this scenario .",
    "nucleon - nucleon profile functions  ( [ eq19 ] ) for different values of fluctuation parameter @xmath24 are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "for @xmath47 we have profile for hard sphere ( cf .",

    "it is interesting to notice that profile function @xmath55 given by equation  ( [ eq21 ] ) with parameters @xmath56 is numerically consistent with @xmath0 as given by equation  ( [ eq19 ] ) .     for different cross section fluctuations characterised by @xmath50 .",

    "recently , the totem collaboration published results on elastic differential proton - proton cross section at @xmath65  tev  @xcite .",

    "the concept of cross section fluctuations takes into account all different configurations , regardless of their particular structure . whether a configuration is `` small '' or `` large ''",
    "is not determined exclusively by the spatial distribution of the partons .",

    "the use of different values of @xmath24 may affect various observables which can be measured experimentally .",
    "as example we demonstrate that cross section fluctuations lead to modification of the distribution of the number of nucleons in inelastic nucleus - nucleus collision .",
    "we show in figure  [ figomegatarg ] a scaled variance of number of target participants as a function of number of projectile participants for pb+pb minimum bias collisions at @xmath66  mb for three values of @xmath24 , almost hard sphere ( @xmath76 ) , almost gaussian ( @xmath77 ) , and @xmath67 obtained from the fit of totem data  @xcite .",
    "there is about @xmath78 difference in magnitude of scaled variance between hard sphere and gaussian approximation .",

    "roughly , @xmath86 with @xmath87 and for increasing @xmath24 the second term in equation  ( [ eq : varnptarg ] ) decrease .",
    "it is remarkable that for increasing fluctuations of cross section ( increasing @xmath24 ) , the scaled fluctuations of @xmath79 decrease .",
    "although constrains on the production cross section imposed by the observed bahavior of multiplicity distributions have been investigated already long time ago  @xcite , this subject is not pursued at moment . in ref .",
