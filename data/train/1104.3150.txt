    "analysis of the lyapunov exponent plays an important role in the problems of propagation of waves .",
    "much attention in recent years has been given to periodic and disordered one - dimensional structures ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "application of such structures include photonic crystals , coupled - resonator optical waveguides , slow - light devices , metamaterials , semiconductor superlattices with given transmission properties and more .",
    "characteristics of real materials , however , may be considerably different from predicted ones due to inevitable disorder of geometric and material parameters . structural perturbation and manufacturing inaccuracies may lead to a substantial reduction of performance @xcite , @xcite and even to complete suppression of wave propagation @xcite , @xcite . in the strongest form the disorder may manifest itself in the anderson type localization , which is a general wave phenomenon for classical and quantum waves in disordered systems . due to multiple scattering , destructive interference occurs , so that the wave amplitude decreases exponentially in the medium . the rate of decay of the solution is defined by the lyapunov exponent , @xmath0 ( the inverse of the localization length ) .",
    "the lyapunov exponent is of major importance in the problems of slowing down light by orders of magnitude , a phenomenon which has been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "such a possibility can be useful in a variety of optical and microwave applications .",
    "choosing wave frequency near stationary points of the electromagnetic dispersion relation allows one to reduce the group velocity by two orders of magnitude @xcite-@xcite .",
    "another model for slowing down light proposed in @xcite is based on the periodic necklace - type waveguide .",
    "an essential common feature of such devices is that the frequency of propagating wave must be located near the spectral band edge or degenerate band edge of the corresponding medium .",
    "one of the major factor , however , limiting performance of optical waveguides is their structural imperfection , and investigation of the influence of different kinds of disorder on the lyapunov exponent becomes of primary importance in manufacturing of optical devices .",
    "papers @xcite-@xcite performed sensitivity analysis of photonic crystals near degenerate and regular spectral band edge under perturbations of geometrical and material parameters , and the impact of these perturbations was compared .",
    "numerical simulations were used to investigate the sensitivity of field enhancement effects at fabry - perot resonances against the bandwidth of the excitation . the gigantic amplitude increase produced by such resonances",
    "was observed , which dramatically deteriorates under small perturbations of the thickness of layers . in particular , the peak field intensity of a 16 layer stack regular band edge photonic crystal decreases by an order of magnitude under @xmath3 perturbation of the layer thicknesses .",
    "the central idea of chaotic behaviour of dynamical systems is widely seen as strong dependence on initial conditions @xcite . in a chaotic system ,",
    "a very small change in the initial conditions can cause a big change in the trajectory .",
    "quantitative criterion for sensitivity is characterized by the lyapunov exponent ( also called the maximal lyapunov exponent ) which measures exponential growth rate of the solution .    in all the applications ,",
    "the influence of the strength of perturbation @xmath1 is essentially different depending on how close the frequency @xmath2 is to the band edge . while @xmath4 in the bulk of the band , it has order @xmath5 near the band edges . therefore , it is important to construct uniform two - parameter asymptotic expansion of the lyapunov exponent for all frequencies of wave propagation .",
    "let @xmath6 be the lyapunov exponent of the optical equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the strength of perturbation of either the value of the periodic refraction index @xmath9 or the length of its period , and @xmath10 is located in an @xmath11-neighbourhood of a non - degenerate band edge .",
    "let also @xmath12 be the lyapunov exponent of the schrdinger equation @xmath13 with the white noise potential @xmath14 and the frequency @xmath2 located near the spectral edge @xmath15 .",
    "the frequency @xmath2 is defined by @xmath10 using the relation @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the transfer matrix of ( [ oe ] ) .",
    "then in @xcite it was shown that @xmath18 and @xmath0 estimate each other uniformly .",
    "that means @xmath19 where positive constants @xmath20 and @xmath21 depend only on @xmath22 and @xmath11 but not on the values of @xmath1 and @xmath10 .",
    "thus , a uniform two - parameter asymptotic expansion of the lyapunov exponent of the schrdinger equation ( [ sche ] ) provides a uniform estimate of the lyapunov exponent of the wave equation ( [ oe ] ) .",
    "because of this , we consider in details the schrdinger equation with different relations between the intensity of noise @xmath1 and the frequency @xmath2 .",
    "we will obtain a uniform asymptotic expansion of @xmath0 followed by numerical evaluation of @xmath0 to determine the range of parameters for which the asymptotic formulas can be used .",
    "in this paper we study the asymptotic behaviour of the lyapunov exponent @xmath23 of the random one - dimensional schrdinger operators @xmath24 \\psi(0 ) = \\cos { \\vartheta}_0 , \\quad { \\displaystyle}\\frac{\\psi^\\prime ( 0)}{\\omega } = \\sin { \\vartheta}_0 , \\end{array } \\label{h}\\ ] ] as a function of the energy @xmath25 and the coupling constant ( intensity ) @xmath1 of the white noise potential . here",
    "@xmath26 ( equations with any real @xmath25 will be considered ) .",
    "the white noise @xmath14 can be understood as the limit of a stationary gaussian process @xmath27 with independent increments on intervals of length @xmath28 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath29 an equivalent alternative approach to define the operator with a white noise potential ( which is used in the present paper ) is based on the reduction of ( [ h ] ) to a system of it stochastic differential equations of the first order for the phase @xmath30 and amplitude @xmath31 of @xmath32 . in what follows",
    "we will denote @xmath33 . then the it and stratonovich representations of ( [ h ] ) coincide in coordinates @xmath34 and both give the same result ( see @xcite ) .",
    "after the standard substitution ( in the prffer form ) @xmath35 equation ( [ h ] ) takes the form @xmath36 usually the reduction of the schrdinger equation to a system of two first order equations is accompanied by the phase - amplitude formalism , i.e. , by using the polar coordinates @xmath37 { \\displaystyle}v=\\frac{\\psi^\\prime}{{\\omega } } =   r ( x ) \\cos { \\vartheta}(x ) , \\end{array } \\label{pol}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 .    the lyapunov exponent @xmath39",
    "is defined by @xmath40 this limit exists _",
    "on the probability space @xmath41 defined by the white noise @xmath42 in ( [ h ] ) ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . we will discuss the limit behaviour of @xmath39 in the different regimes when @xmath43 or @xmath44 ( small and large disorder ) and @xmath45 or @xmath46 ( long and short waves ) .",
    "we also introduce some combinations of @xmath47 and @xmath48 to describe the intermediate asymptotics .",
    "asymptotic behaviour of @xmath0 for @xmath49 and fixed @xmath50 was established in papers @xcite and @xcite where it was shown that @xmath51 paper @xcite contains the formula @xmath52 for fixed @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we show that in fact @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is a function of @xmath58 .",
    "thus , ( [ gam0 ] ) is also valid for arbitrary @xmath1 and @xmath2 such that @xmath59    in this paper we suggest a simple approach to obtaining the asymptotic expansion for @xmath0 as @xmath60 as well as @xmath61 . therefore , different combinations of large and small perturbations and frequencies are covered .",
    "we show that @xmath62 .",
    "in particular , it provides low frequency asymptotics of @xmath0 when @xmath1 is fixed and @xmath63 .",
    "the case of @xmath64 is also considered .",
    "the next section contains an exact formula for @xmath0 followed by a section with derivation of its asymptotics expansion .",

    "thus from ( [ genf ] ) with @xmath97 we obtain @xmath98    the right - hand side of the latter equation does not depend on @xmath31 .",
