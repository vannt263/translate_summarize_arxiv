    "in this article , we study the discrete painlev equations over finite fields .",
    "the discrete painlev equations are non - autonomous , integrable mappings which tend to some continuous painlev equations for appropriate choices of the continuous limit @xcite . when we treate a discrete painlev equation over a finite field , we encounter the problem that its time evolution is not always well defined",
    ". this problem can not be solved even if we extend the domain from @xmath1 to the projective space @xmath2 , because @xmath2 is no longer a field ; we can not determine the values such as @xmath3 and so on .",
    "there may be two strategies to define the time evolution over a finite field without inconsistencies .",
    "one is to reduce the domain so that the time evolution will not pass the indeterminate states , and the other is to extend the domain so that it can include all the orbits .",
    "we take the latter strategy and adopt two approaches .",
    "the first approach is the application of the theory of space of initial conditions developed by okamoto @xcite and sakai @xcite .",
    "we show that the dynamics of the equations over finite fields can be well defined in the space of initial conditions .",
    "the second approach we adopt is closely related to the theory of arithmetic dynamical systems , which concerns the dynamics over arithmetic sets such as @xmath4 or @xmath5 or a number field that is of number theoretic interest @xcite . in arithmetic dynamics , the change of dynamical properties of polynomial or rational mappings give significant information when reducing them modulo prime numbers .",
    "the mapping is said to have good reduction if , roughly speaking , the reduction commutes with the mapping itself @xcite .",
    "linear fractional transformations in @xmath6 are typical examples of mappings with a good reduction .",
    "recently bi - rational mappings over finite fields have been investigated in terms of integrability @xcite . since all the orbits are cyclic as far as the mapping",
    "is closed over the ( projective ) space of a finite field and the integrable mapping has a conserved quantity , one can estimate the distribution of orbit length by using hesse - weil bounds or numerical calculations .",
    "the qrt mappings @xcite over finite fields have been studied in detail by choosing the parameter values so that indeterminate points are avoided @xcite .",
    "they have a good reduction over finite fields .",
    "we prove that , although most of the integrable mappings with singularities do not have a good reduction modulo a prime in general , they have an _ almost good reduction _ , which is a generalization of good reduction .",
    "we apply the method to the @xmath0-discrete painlev ii equation ( @xmath0p ) .",
    "the time evolution of the discrete painlev equations can be well defined generically , even when not defined over the projective space of the field . in particular , the reduction from a local field @xmath7 to a finite field @xmath8 is shown to be well defined and is used to obtain some special solutions directly from those over fields of characteristic zero such as @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "a discrete painlev equation is a non - autonomous and nonlinear second order ordinary difference equation with several parameters .",
    "when it is defined over a finite field , the dependent variable takes only a finite number of values and its time evolution will attain an indeterminate state in many cases for generic values of the parameters and initial conditions .",
    "for example , the dpequation is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are constant parameters @xcite .",
    "let @xmath14 for a prime @xmath15 and a positive integer @xmath16 .",
    "when is defined over a finite field @xmath17 , the dependent variable @xmath18 will eventually take values @xmath19 for generic parameters and initial values @xmath20 , and we can not proceed to evolve it . if we extend the domain from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , @xmath2 is not a field and we can not define arithmetic operation in . to determine its time evolution consistently",
    ", we have two choices : one is to restrict the parameters and the initial values to a smaller domain so that the singularities do not appear .",
    "the other is to extend the domain on which the equation is defined . in this article",
    ", we will adopt the latter approach .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite as : @xmath23 where @xmath24",
    ". then we can regard as a mapping defined on the domain @xmath25 . to resolve the indeterminacy at @xmath26",
    ", we apply the theory of the state of initial conditions developed by sakai @xcite .",
    "first we extend the domain to @xmath27 , and then blow it up at four points @xmath28 to obtain the space of initial conditions : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the space obtained from the two dimensional affine space @xmath31 by blowing up twice as @xmath32,[u_1:v_1 ]   \\right)\\ \\big|\\ \\right .",

    "note that @xmath39 is well - defined in the case @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath52 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 can be identified with the lines @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "therefore we have found that , through the construction of the space of initial conditions , the dpequation can be well - defined over finite fields .",
    "however there are some unnecessary elements in the space of initial conditions when we consider a finite field , because we are working on a discrete topology and do not need continuity of the map .",
    "let @xmath40 be the space of initial conditions and @xmath58 be the number of elements of it .",
    "for the dpequation , we obtain @xmath59 , since @xmath2 contains @xmath60 elements .",
    "however an exceptional curve @xmath46 is transferred to another exceptional curve @xmath61 , and @xmath62 \\in e_2^{\\sp}$ ] to @xmath62 \\in e_2^{\\sp'}$ ] or to a point in @xmath61 .",
    "hence we can reduce the space of initial conditions @xmath40 to the minimal space of initial conditions @xmath63 which is the minimal subset of @xmath40 including @xmath64 , closed under the time evolution . by subtracting unnecessary elements",
    "we find @xmath65 . in summary",
    ", we obtain the following proposition :    the domain of the dpequation over @xmath1 can be extended to the minimal domain @xmath63 on which the time evolution at time step @xmath66 is well defined .",
    "moreover @xmath67 .    in figure [ figure1 ]",
    ", we show a schematic diagram of the map @xmath39 on @xmath40 , and its restriction map @xmath68 on @xmath63 with @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we can also say that the figure [ figure1 ] is a diagram for the autonomous version of the equation when @xmath72 . in the case of @xmath69 , we have @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the above approach is equally valid for the other discrete painlev equations and we can define them over finite fields by constructing isomorphisms on the spaces of initial conditions . thus we conclude that a discrete painlev equation can be well defined over a finite field by redefining the initial domain properly . however , for a general nonlinear equation , explicit construction of the space of initial conditions over a finite field is not so straightforward @xcite and it will not help us to obtain the explicit solutions . in the next section ,",
    "we show another extention of the space of initial conditions : we extend it to @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath15 be a prime number and for each @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) write @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 and @xmath81 are coprime integers neither of which is divisible by @xmath15 .",

    "we define the reduction of @xmath89 modulo @xmath90 as @xmath91 : @xmath92 .",
    "note that the reduction is a ring homomorphism .",
    "the reduction is generalized to @xmath93 : @xmath94 which is no longer homomorphic .",
    "for a rational map of the plane @xmath95 defined on some domain @xmath96 , @xmath97 is defined as the map whose coefficients are all reduced . the rational system @xmath98 is said to have a _ good reduction _ ( modulo @xmath90 on the domain @xmath96 ) if we have @xmath99 for any @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "we have defined a generalized notion in our previous letter and have explained its usefulness ;    a ( non - autonomous ) rational system @xmath101 : @xmath102 @xmath103 is said to have an almost good reduction modulo @xmath90 on the domain @xmath104 , if there exists a positive integer @xmath105 for any @xmath106 and time step @xmath66 such that @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "if we can take @xmath109 , then the mapping has a good reduction .",
    "let us first review some of the previous findings in order to see the significance of the notion of _ almost good reduction_. let us consider the mapping @xmath110 : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a non - negative integer parameter .",
    "the map is known to be integrable if and only if @xmath113 .",
    "when @xmath113 , the map belongs to the qrt family and is integrable in the sense that it has a conserved quantity .",
    "we also note that the system can be seen as an autonomous version of the @xmath0-discrete painlev i equation for @xmath113 .",

    "[ propqrt ]    in the previous work , the dpequation , too , has been proved to have almost good reduction .",
    "it is reasonable to postulate that almost good reduction is closely related to the integrability of maps of the plane .",
    "we further clarify this point by demonstrating that @xmath0-discrete analogue of the painlev ii equation also has almost good reduction .",
    "the @xmath0-discrete analogue of painlev ii equation ( @xmath0pequation ) is a following @xmath0-difference equation : @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath0 are parameters @xcite .",
    "it is also convenient to rewrite as a system form @xmath117 where @xmath118 .",
    "we can prove the following proposition :    suppose that @xmath119 are integers not divisible by @xmath15 , then the mapping has an almost good reduction modulo @xmath90 on the domain @xmath120 .",

    "in @xcite it has been proved that over @xmath139 with @xmath140 @xmath141 is solved by the functions given by @xmath142 where @xmath143 is a solution of the @xmath0-discrete airy equation : @xmath144 as in the case of the dpequation , we can obtain the corresponding solutions to over @xmath138 by reduction modulo @xmath90 according to the proposition [ propqp2 ] .",

    "in this article we investigated the two types of the discrete painlev ii equations and their reduction modulo a prime . to avoid indeterminacy , we examined two approaches .",
    "one is to extend the domain by blowing up at indeterminate points .",
    "according to the theory of the space of initial conditions , this approach is possible for all the discrete painlev equations .",
    "an interesting point is that the space of initial conditions over a finite field can be reduced to a smaller domain resulting from the discrete topology of the finite field .",

    "we defined the notion of _ almost good reduction _ which is an arithmetic analogue of passing the singularity confinement test , and proved that the @xmath0-discrete painlev ii equation has this property .",
    "thanks to this property , not only the time evolution of the discrete painlev equations can be well defined , but also a solution over @xmath9 ( or @xmath7 ) can be directly transferred to a solution over @xmath155 .",

    "we conjecture that this approach is equally valid in other discrete painlev equations .",

    "however , we have little results for other interesting equations , such as chaotic maps , linearizable maps , and generalised painlev systems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we expect that this ` almost good reduction ' criterion can be applied to finding higher order _ integrable _ mappings in arithmetic dynamics , and that a similar approach is also useful for the investigation of discrete partial difference equations such as soliton equations over finite fields @xcite .",
