    "pair formation between fermions is one of the most rich and active fields of investigation in condensed matter systems , occuring in contexts as varied as exciton formation in quantum well structures @xcite to its most well - studied realization , the superconducting state @xcite .",
    "indeed , the possibility of pair formation has many even wider implications , including the early speculation that it might dominate the nature of interior of neutron stars @xcite . by far",
    "the most commonly studied situation is one in which the populations of the two fermion species ( normally up and down spins ) are balanced , and cooper pairs form with zero center of mass momentum @xcite . soon after the development of the bcs theory @xcite of superconductivity ,",
    "the question of pair formation in polarized superconducting systems , _",
    "i.e. _ when the populations of the two spin states are imbalanced , was addressed independently by fulde and ferrel @xcite ( ff ) , larkin and ovchinnikov @xcite ( lo ) and sarma @xcite .",
    "the question was motivated by interest in the nature of superconductivity in the presence of a magnetic field , which induces spin polarization .",
    "ff and lo ( henceforth fflo ) proposed similar , yet not identical , mechanisms whereby the cooper pairs form with non - zero center of mass momentum equal to the difference of the now - unequal fermi momenta of the two species . as a consequence , in the fflo scenario",
    "the order parameter is not homogeneous ; the system has pair - rich regions separated by regions depleted in pairs but with an excess of the majority , unpaired fermion species . in the competing proposal by sarma ,",
    "the fermi surfaces deform to allow pair formation with zero center of mass momentum .",
    "this means that the system remains uniform ; it is a homogeneous mixture of pairs and unpaired fermions from the majority population . in other words , in the fflo mechanism , the momentum distribution of pairs has its peak at a momentum equal to the difference between the two fermi momenta , @xmath0 . on the other hand , the sarma mechanism would result in a pair momentum distribution with @xmath1 .",
    "deciding between these two scenarios experimentally proved to be very difficult ; the observation of the fflo phase in solids was only achieved relatively recently in heavy fermion systems @xcite .",
    "this question has recently taken on added importance .",
    "interest in the astrophysical community has continued to grow and broaden .",
    "it is now believed that at extreme conditions of pressure , for example in the interior of supermassive stars , quark matter forms and pairing between the quarks could lead to color superconductivity @xcite .",
    "more immediate experimental systems where these effects may be observed , and are indeed sought , are ultra - cold atoms confined in traps where two hyperfine states of fermionic atoms play the role of up and down spins .",
    "such experiments have now reported the presence of pairing in the case of unequal populations @xcite in three - dimensional cigar shaped traps and in one dimensional traps @xcite .",
    "however , the precise nature of the pairing has not yet been elucidated experimentally .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "much effort has been put into understanding the pairing mechanism .",
    "calculations using mean field theory @xcite , effective lagrangian @xcite and bethe ansatz @xcite studies have been performed for the uniform system , with extensions to the trapped system using the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "extensive numerical work for the one dimensional system using quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) @xcite , and the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite ) has demonstrated that , in the ground state , population imbalance leads to a robust fflo phase over a very wide range of polarization and interaction strengths .",
    "in addition to the above case of population imbalance , the case of mass imbalance has been addressed theoretically @xcite and numerically @xcite .",
    "this case is relevant to color superconductivity , where the quark masses are not equal , and also to ultra - cold @xmath2k-@xmath3li atomic mixtures .",
    "the stability of the fflo phase at finite temperatures remains an open question .",
    "mean field calculations @xcite possibly shed some light but can be less reliable in low dimension where quantum fluctuations are large .",
    "this question is of paramount importance for experiments , especially in trapped atomic systems , since difficulties in cooling fermionic atoms raise concerns about whether the currently attainable temperatures are low enough for a thorough investigation of fflo physics .",
    "the present paper reports on qmc studies of this issue which provide an exact treatment of interaction effects on lattices of finite size .",
    "the key result is that , when the polarization is sufficiently large , the paired phase can exist up to temperatures of order one tenth of the fermi energy , even in the presence of a confining potential .",
    "current experiments on trapped atoms are likely in this temperature range .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will discuss the model and the numerical methods used . in section iii , we discuss our results for the phase diagram of the uniform one - dimensional system at finite temperature .",
    "in section iv we discuss the trapped one dimensional system followed by our conclusions in section v.",
    "in order to study the pairing mechanism of fermions in an optical lattice , we consider the one - dimensional fermionic hubbard hamiltonian , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are fermion creation and annihilation operators on lattice site @xmath7 satisfying the usual anticommutation relation , @xmath8 .",
    "the fermionic species are labeled by @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the corresponding number operator .",
    "the energy scale is set by taking the hopping parameter @xmath11 .",
    "the contact interaction strength is @xmath12 which is negative since we are interested in pair formation in the attractive model . in the grand canonical ensemble ,",
    "the populations are fixed by tuning the chemical potentials for the two species , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , whereas in the canonical ensemble this term is absent and the populations are fixed simply by choosing the number of particles . as we discuss below , both ensembles will be used in this work .",
    "the last term describes the confining harmonic trap which is centered at the midpoint , @xmath15 , of the @xmath16-site lattice .",
    "we take periodic boundary conditions .",
    "our quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) results are obtained using two different methods : the determinant qmc algorithm @xcite ( dqmc ) and the stochastic green function ( sgf ) technique @xcite . in dqmc",
    ", the interaction term in the hamiltonian , which is quartic in the fermionic operators , is decoupled via the hubbard - stratonovich ( hs ) transformation .",
    "this allows the fermion operators to be traced out , giving an expression for the partition function as an integral over the configurations of the auxiliary hs field .",
    "we employ the grand canonical formulation of dqmc .",
    "the statistical weight of these configurations is given by the product of the spin up and down determinants , each of which can change sign depending on the hs configuration .",
    "when the populations are balanced , @xmath17 , it is well known that dqmc does not suffer from the sign problem for an attractive interaction ( @xmath18 ) : the two determinants are identical and thus their product is always positive .",
    "this is no longer the case when the populations are imbalanced , @xmath19 ( or for @xmath20 ) , resulting in the appearance of the sign problem .",
    "the severity of this problem depends on several factors such as the size of the system , the coupling constant , the temperature and the imbalance in the populations . for the systems and parameters we consider in this work ( see below ) the average sign did not fall below @xmath21 , which allowed us to obtain good statistical precision in our simulations .",
    "we used this algorithm for the uniform system ; it has the advantage of rather fast convergence rates , but to perform simulations at fixed particle numbers , the chemical potentials need to be tuned .",
    "a typical simulation for @xmath22 sites and @xmath23 with an imaginary time step @xmath24 runs for about @xmath25 to @xmath26 days on a desktop computer and yields error bars of the order of @xmath27 for the peak of the pair momentum distribution , a central quantity of interest in this work .",
    "the sgf algorithm @xcite with directed update @xcite can be used both in the grand canonical or canonical modes .",
    "we describe it in more detail than dqmc since it has been developed much more recently .",
    "first , the hamiltonian is written as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is diagonal in the occupation number basis of the direct space , and @xmath30 is the remaining non - diagonal part .",
    "the algorithm samples an extended partition function represented in the interaction picture , @xmath31,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the time - ordering operator and the time dependence of any operator @xmath33 is given by the interaction representation @xmath34 .",
    "the  green operator \" @xmath35 is defined by its matrix elements , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the number of creations and destructions of particles that transform the ( occupation number ) state @xmath39 into @xmath40 .",
    "the matrix @xmath41 is a decreasing function of @xmath42 @xcite",
    ". the extended partition function ( [ extendedz ] ) is expanded in @xmath30 yielding operator strings of the form : @xmath43 the green operator updates the operator string ( [ operatorstring ] ) by propagating in imaginary time , while inserting and removing @xmath30 operators . from its definition ,",
    "the green operator contains terms that do not conserve the number of particles .",
    "however if the hamiltonian commutes with the operator that measures the total number of particles , @xmath44 , for example the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , then only conservative terms of @xmath35 have non vanishing contributions since the trace imposes the same number of particles both at the begining and the end of the operator string .",
    "as a consequence the number of particles remains strictly constant and the sgf algorithm works in the canonical ensemble by nature .",
    "however , a simple trick can be used in order to simulate exactly the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "the idea is to add a non conservative part @xmath45 to the hamiltonian , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is an optimization parameter , and allows the green operator to insert at most one @xmath45 operator in the string .",
    "this allows the number of particles to fluctuate , while the addition of the usual term @xmath48 to the hamiltonian determines the mean number of particles via the chemical potential @xmath49 . when measuring physical quantities , ignoring configurations in which the operator string contains a @xmath45 operator , corresponds to integrating over these configurations the probability of going from a given configuration with @xmath50 particles and no @xmath45 to another one with @xmath51 particles and no @xmath45 , via intermediate configurations with @xmath45 .",
    "this integrated probability corresponds exactly to the probability of going from one configuration with @xmath50 particles to another one with @xmath51 particles . as a result ,",
    "the configurations of the grand - canonical partition function @xmath52 are generated with the correct boltzmann weight .    to use this algorithm to simulate fermions in one dimension",
    ", we first use the jordan - wigner transformation to map the system onto a system of hard core bosons .",
    "consequently , this algorithm does not suffer from the sign problem but , clearly , it can not be used in higher dimensions where the jordan - wigner transformation fails to solve the sign problem .",
    "we used this algorithm in the canonical ensemble mainly for the confined system where it is very convenient to control the populations directly rather than tune the chemical potentials .",
    "a typical simulation for @xmath53 and @xmath54 runs for about @xmath26 days on a desktop computer and yields an error of the order of @xmath27 for the peak of the pair momentum distribution ..    as part of our code verification , the grand canonical sgf and dqmc were compared for the same parameters and found to yield the same results within the error bars .",
    "furthermore , we verified that dqmc and grand canonical sgf both agreed with the canonical sgf when the chemical potentials in the grand canonical cases were tuned to give the same populations as the canonical cases , see for example ref .",
    "the results presented below were obtained with these three algorithms ; the choice being dictated by the specific measurement we were after . because of the equivalence of the three algorithms , we will not comment below on which results were obtained with which algorithm .    using these algorithms ,",
    "we calculate both the real space green functions of the species , @xmath55 , and the pair green function , @xmath56 , @xmath57 where @xmath58 destroys a pair on site @xmath59 .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath60 yields the momentum distributions @xmath61 and the transform of @xmath62 leads to the pair momentum distribution , @xmath63 , a central quantity in this work . in the non - interacting limit , the fermi momentum of a population is given by @xmath64 , where @xmath16 is the length of the system and @xmath65 the number of particles .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the physics in the absence of a confining potential , @xmath66    as discussed in the introduction , it is now generally agreed that the ground state of a fermi system with attractive interactions and imbalanced populations is the fflo state . the mismatch in the fermi momenta results in pair formation with nonzero center - of - mass momentum @xmath67 .",
    "consequently the pair momentum distribution , the fourier transform of the pair green function eq.([pairgfct ] ) , peaks at this value of the momentum .",
    "this peak at nonzero momentum serves as the principal diagnostic indicating the presence of the fflo state @xcite .",
    "the situation at finite temperature , which is important experimentally , is less clear .",
    "approximate methods , such as mean field , do not always yield the same phase diagram .",
    "in this section we will map out the phase diagram in the polarization - temperature plane where the polarization is defined by , @xmath68 where @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) is the majority ( minority ) population and @xmath71 is the total number of particles . to this end , we study , at fixed @xmath72 , the behaviour of the pair momentum distribution , @xmath73 , as a function of the temperature @xmath74 . for very low @xmath74 , @xmath63 peaks at @xmath75 and",
    "the system is in the fflo state .",
    "as @xmath74 is increased , the peak in @xmath76 gets lower and shifts to @xmath77 .",
    "the temperature at which this first happens is the cross - over temperature , @xmath78 .",
    "note that in this one - dimensional system , transitions at finite temperature are not true phase transitions , but rather cross - overs .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : finitetpairmom ] where we show qmc results for @xmath63 as a function of @xmath79 for several values of the inverse temperature @xmath80 .",
    "the simulations were done for fixed populations , @xmath81 and @xmath82 on a system with @xmath83 lattice sites and an attractive interaction @xmath84 .",
    "the figure shows clearly that as @xmath80 decreases from @xmath54 , the height of the fflo peak decreases and , in fact , shifts to lower @xmath79 values .",
    "the shift to lower @xmath79 values is made more evident by simulating larger systems since this gives more @xmath79 grid points .",
    "when the peak at nonzero @xmath79 is equal to @xmath85 to within @xmath86 , we consider the peak to have shifted to @xmath77 and the fflo state to have disappeared . in the fig .",
    "[ fig : finitetpairmom ] this happens for @xmath87 .",
    "reducing @xmath80 further leads to continued decrease of the height of the peak , which remains at @xmath77 .",
    "the question then arises as to how the fflo peak behaves as a function of @xmath12 at fixed @xmath80 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( and consequently fixed @xmath72 ) .",
    "clearly , for @xmath88 there is no pairing and no fflo peak ; then , as @xmath89 is increased , the peak at nonzero @xmath79 forms and its height increases .",
    "however , we found that as @xmath89 continues to increase , the fflo peak will reach a maximum height and then start to decrease .",
    "we also found that the peak is more sensitive to @xmath89 at higher @xmath74 .",
    "we believe the reason the peak starts to go down at high values of @xmath89 is that with increasing attraction , the pairing becomes increasingly localized in space and eventually the paired fermions form a very tightly bound bosonic molecule and the system resembles closely a usual bose - fermi mixture which does not exhibit fflo peaks .",

    "a peak at non - zero momentum is a signature of the fflo state .",

    "the error bars are of the order of the symbol size.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the peak of @xmath63 at @xmath91 means that the system is , in fact , not homogenous : the spatial pair green function , eq.([pairgfct ] ) , oscillates as a function of distance with a period given by @xmath92 .",
    "these oscillations have been discussed , for example , in the context of mean field theory @xcite .",
    "physically , they indicate that the system has regions which are rich in pairs separated by regions poor in pairs but rich in the excess fermion species .",
    "such oscillations are shown in fig .",

    "note that the oscillations disappear at the higher temperature.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the question then arises as to the nature of the phase at @xmath95 .",
    "two possibilities are : ( 1 ) at @xmath95 the pairs are broken and the system is a mixture of two fermi liquids or ( 2 ) pairs are still present but the system has been homogenized by thermal agitation . a first indication is given by the energy scales involved .",
    "the binding energy of the pairs at very low temperature is of the order of @xmath89 and in our system here @xmath96 .",
    "so , to break the pairs , an equivalent amount of thermal energy is needed which means @xmath97 . for the case discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig : finitetgreenf ] , the crossover from fflo to the uniform phase happens at @xmath87 not @xmath98 .",
    "this means that @xmath78 is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the temperature needed to break the pairs .",
    "this , then , favors the conclusion that when fflo first disappears , the pairs have not yet been broken and the system is in a homogeneous polarized paired phase ( ppp ) .",
    "another piece of evidence is provided by studying the average double occupancy of the sites given by @xmath99 in the absence of pairing , @xmath100 while if pairing is perfect , _",

    "figure  [ fig : phasediag ] shows the resulting phase diagrams for @xmath110 ( half filling ) and @xmath111 ( quarter filling ) .",
    "we mention again that the phase boundaries represent crossover behaviour , not phase transitions since this one - dimensional quantum system does not have phase transitions at finite temperature .",
    "the fermi temperatures shown in the figure are calculated assuming equal populations using @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the fermi energy .",
    "the phase diagrams show clearly that the fflo phase is quite robust , persisting over a wide range of polarizations and to rather high temperatures . for @xmath110",
    ", it persists up to @xmath115 and for @xmath111 up to @xmath116 .",
    "we also see that , in both cases , the crossover temperature increases with the polarization up to a maximum value after which it decreases again .",
    "this can be understood physically as follows : when @xmath72 is small , the fermi `` surfaces '' of the two populations are so close to matching that very little thermal energy is needed to get them to match .",
    "thus even at very low finite temperature , pairing takes place at zero center - of - mass momentum .",
    "therefore , larger polarizations have a stabilizing effect on the fflo phase .",
    "there are numerical difficulties with the determination of the phase diagram at very low and very high polarizations . at very high polarization",
    ", there is a very small number of minority particles , making the fflo signal difficult to discern clearly .",
    "we were therefore not able to examine @xmath117 in our simulations .",
    "for that reason , some symbols on the phase boundary at high polarization are open , indicating that up to this polarization , the system is in the fflo phase .",

    "in addition , at small polarization , very low temperature is needed to observe the fflo phase .",

    "the general shape of the fflo phase obtained there ( fig .",
    "@xcite ) is similar to what we found here .",
    "however there are very important differences .",
    "for example , unlike mft , we have found that there is no direct transition from the fflo phase to the fermi liquid phase ( broken pairs ) : the fflo phase is destroyed at a temperature which is much lower than that required to break the pairs and is replaced by the ppp .",
    "reference @xcite predicts phase separation between the fflo and ppp at low @xmath72 and @xmath74 ( fig .  9 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in order to examine this possibility , we study the density histograms in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the idea is as follows : starting in , say , the ppp , we increase the polarization by tuning the chemical potentials , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . for each choice of @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    ", we accumulate the histograms of the particle populations .",
    "if phase separation is present , then as the system approaches the phase separation region , the density histogram of _ each _ species should develop a double peak structure .",
    "if no such structure develops , it means that there is no phase separation as the system crosses from the ppp to the fflo .",
    "we first verify the correct behaviour of the obtained histogram as the size of the system is changed . in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogramfs ] we show the histograms for two system sizes at half filling but with all other parameters fixed .",
    "we see that the histograms for the two system sizes agree very well ; the main difference is that the larger system size ( obviously ) allows for a finer grid of densities which redistributes the values a little and exhibits the main peak more clearly . in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram ] we show , for fixed inverse temperature @xmath93 , the histograms for three cases at half filling : in the top panel the system is just inside the ppp phase , the middle panel the system is at the ppp - fflo boundary and the bottom panel the system is just inside the fflo phase .",
