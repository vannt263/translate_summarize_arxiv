    "traditional cantor sets are generated by iterations of an operation of down - scaling by fractions which are powers of a fixed positive integer .",
    "for each iteration in the process , we leave gaps .",
    "for example , the best - known ternary cantor set is formed by scaling down by @xmath1 and leaving a single gap in each step .",
    "an associated cantor measure @xmath2 is then obtained by the same sort of iteration of scales , and , at each step , a renormalization . in accordance with classical harmonic analysis",
    ", these measures may be seen to be infinite bernoulli convolutions .",
    "our present analysis is motivated by earlier work , beginning with @xcite .",
    "we consider recursive down - scaling by @xmath3 for @xmath4 and leave a single gap at each iteration - step .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the associated cantor measures @xmath5 have the property that @xmath6 possesses orthogonal fourier bases of complex exponentials ( i.e. fourier onbs ) .",
    "more recently , it was shown in @xcite that the scales @xmath3 are the _ only _ values that generate measures with fourier bases .    given a fixed cantor measure @xmath2 , a corresponding set of frequencies @xmath7 of exponents in an onb is said to be a _ spectrum _ for @xmath2 .",
    "for example , in the case of recursive scaling by powers of @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath8 , a possible spectrum @xmath7 for @xmath9 has the form @xmath7 as shown below in equation .",
    "a spectrum for a cantor measure turns out to be a _ lacunary _",
    "( in the sense of szolem mandelbrojt ) set of integers or half integers .",
    "we direct the interested reader to @xcite regarding lacunary series and their riesz products .",
    "when @xmath10 and @xmath2 are fixed , we now become concerned with the possible variety of spectra .",
    "given @xmath7 some canonical choice of spectrum for @xmath2 , then one possible way to construct a new fourier spectrum for @xmath9 is to scale by an odd positive integer @xmath11 to form a set @xmath12 .",
    "while for some values of @xmath11 this scaling produces a spectrum , it is known that other values of @xmath11 do not yield spectra .",
    "this particular question is intrinsically multiplicative : since @xmath2 is an infinite bernoulli convolution , the onb questions involve consideration of infinite products of the riesz type . despite this intuition",
    ", we show here ( theorem [ thm : main ] ) that there is a connection between this multiplicative construction and a construction of new onbs with an additive operation .",
    "we are then able to produce even more examples of these additive - construction spectra .",
    "throughout this paper , we consider the hilbert space @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the @xmath0-bernoulli convolution measure .",
    "this measure has a rich history , dating back to work of wintner and erds @xcite .",
    "more recently , hutchinson @xcite developed a construction of bernoulli measures via iterated function systems ( ifss ) .",
    "the measure @xmath14 is supported on a cantor subset @xmath15 of @xmath16 which entails scaling by @xmath0 . in 1998 ,",
    "jorgensen and pedersen @xcite discovered that the hilbert space @xmath13 contains a fourier basis  an orthonormal basis of exponential functions  and hence allows for a fourier analysis .",
    "for ease of notation , throughout this paper we will write @xmath17 for the function @xmath18 and for a discrete set @xmath7 we will write @xmath19 for the collection of exponentials @xmath20 .",
    "there is a self - similarity inherent in the @xmath0-bernoulli convolution @xmath21 which yields an infinite product formulation for @xmath22 : @xmath23    exponential functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 are orthogonal when @xmath26 a collection of exponential functions @xmath19 indexed by the discrete set @xmath7 is an orthonormal basis for @xmath13 exactly when the function @xmath27 is the constant function @xmath28 .",
    "we call the function @xmath29 the _ spectral function _ for the set @xmath7 .",
    "the fourier basis for @xmath14 constructed in @xcite is the set @xmath30 , where @xmath31    if @xmath19 is an orthonormal basis ( onb ) for @xmath13 , we say that @xmath7 is a _ spectrum _ for @xmath14 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that if @xmath7 is a spectrum for @xmath14 and @xmath11 is an odd integer , then @xmath32 is an orthogonal collection of exponential functions . in many cases , we find that @xmath32 is actually another onb @xcite .",
    "this is rather surprising , or at least very different behavior from the usual fourier analysis on an interval with respect to lebesgue measure .",
    "we often refer to the spectrum in equation as the _ canonical spectrum _ for @xmath13 , while other spectra for the same measure space can be called _ alternate spectra_.",
    "in this section , we describe two naturally occurring isometries on @xmath13 which are defined via their action on the canonical fourier basis @xmath19 .",
    "observe from equation that @xmath7 satisfies the invariance equation @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the disjoint union .",
    "we then define    @xmath35    since @xmath36 and @xmath37 map the onb elements into a proper subset of the onb , they are proper isometries . therefore ,",
    "for @xmath38 we have @xmath39 and @xmath40 is a projection onto the range of the respective operator .",
    "the adjoints of @xmath41 are readily computed ( see @xcite for details ) : @xmath42 and @xmath43    it is shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) that the definitions of @xmath36 and @xmath37 extend to all @xmath44 for @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46    for every integer @xmath47 , there is a @xmath48-algebra with @xmath49 generators called the cuntz algebra , which we denote by @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "we will describe representations of @xmath51 which are generated by two isometries on @xmath13 satisfying the conditions below .",

    "when these relations hold , @xmath56 generate a representation of the cuntz algebra @xmath57 .    from @xcite",
    ", we know that @xmath36 and @xmath37 defined in equation satisfy the cuntz relations for @xmath58 , hence yield a representation of the cuntz algebra @xmath51 ( in fact , an irreducible representation ) within the algebra of bounded operators @xmath59 .",
    "as we mentioned above , given a spectrum @xmath7 , the frequencies @xmath12 , for @xmath11 an odd integer , generate an orthonormal collection of exponential functions in @xmath9 .",
    "given @xmath7 from equation , one question of interest is the characterization of the odd integers @xmath11 for which the scaled spectrum @xmath12 generates an onb . as a means of exploring this question , we let @xmath60 be the operator @xmath61 since @xmath60 maps an onb to an orthonormal collection , @xmath60 is an isometry and is unitary if and only if @xmath32 is an onb .    the following lemmas provide useful relationships between the isometries @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath60 .",
    "[ lem : vp ] let @xmath36 and @xmath37 be the isometry operators from equation .",
    "if @xmath62 is a @xmath63-automorphism on @xmath59 , then the operator @xmath64 is unitary .",
    "assume @xmath62 is a @xmath63-automorphism .",
    "the cuntz relations on @xmath36 and @xmath37 give @xmath65    a similar computation proves that @xmath66 , hence @xmath67 is unitary .",
    "[ lem : us1 ] let @xmath68 be the multiplication operator @xmath69 . given @xmath70 such that @xmath60 is unitary , we define the map @xmath71 on @xmath59",
    ". then @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that @xmath60 commutes with @xmath36 for all odd @xmath11 , so @xmath72 .",
    "since @xmath60 is unitary , we have @xmath74 .",
    "we prove that @xmath75 , which is thus equivalent to the statement of the lemma .",
    "@xmath76 therefore , @xmath77    we now discover a connection between the scaled spectrum @xmath12 and what we call an _ additive spectrum _",
    "@xmath78 . it will turn out that this connection tells us more about the additive spectra than the scaled spectra .",
    "[ thm : main ] given any odd natural number @xmath11 , if @xmath32 is an onb then @xmath78 is also an onb .    since @xmath32 is an onb , we have that the operator @xmath60 from equation is a unitary operator .",
    "we define the map on @xmath79 @xmath80 since @xmath60 is unitary , it is straightforward to verify that @xmath81 is a @xmath63-automorphism on @xmath59 .",
    "if we apply @xmath81 to our operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we have by lemma [ lem : us1 ] , @xmath82 define the operator @xmath83 then @xmath84 is unitary by lemma [ lem : vp ] .",
    "we see that if @xmath85 , i.e. @xmath86 for some @xmath87 , that @xmath88 since @xmath89 and @xmath90 by the cuntz relations . similarly , if @xmath91 , hence @xmath92 for some @xmath87 , then @xmath93 .",
    "in fact , @xmath84 maps @xmath94 bijectively onto @xmath95 . therefore , since @xmath84 is unitary , we can conclude that @xmath78 is an onb for @xmath13 .",
    "we now address the spectral functions  recall equation for our additive sets .",
    "we can use the splitting @xmath96 to divide the spectral function for @xmath7 into the corresponding terms @xmath97 denote the sums on the right - hand side of the equation above by @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively .",
