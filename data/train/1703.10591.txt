    "since the seminal work by skyrme @xcite , where the first three - dimensional topological defect solution arising from a nonlinear field theory was presented in the context of particle physics , a very large number of studies reporting the impact of some kind of topological defect has appeared in the physics literature and , in recent years , this area of research remains one the most active fields in many areas of the physics , including condensed matter physics @xcite , field theory topological - ft , and cosmology @xcite .",
    "for instance , in an astrophysical scenario , topological defects arises largely from grand unified theories ( guts ) of elementary particles . in this case",
    ", it is expected that the known local gauge symmetry group @xmath0  resulted from an underlying symmetry group @xmath1after a series of spontaneous symmetry breakings .",
    "thus , the early universe has gone through a number of phase transitions , with one or more several types of topological defects possibly being left behind .",
    "another interesting background , where we can find topological configurations , is high energy physics @xcite . in this context",
    ", topological structures are found for example in the massive thirring model @xcite , in nonlinear chiral theories duff - isham , in the gross - neveu model @xcite , in a chiral @xmath2  @xmath3  @xmath2  model @xcite , in an artificial spin - ice lattice @xcite , and where the peccei - quinn symmetry is broken after inflation @xcite .",
    "nowadays we know that the carbon is the key ingredient in the called organic chemistry . from the viewpoint of condensed matter physics , the carbon plays a crucial role in the formation of new classes of topological materials casprp09 with a large variety of physical properties @xcite .",
    "in particular , the material named in the literature as graphene is the most famous due to their great potential for technological applications .",
    "those materials are a two - dimensional ( 2d ) allotrope of carbon , which consists of a monotonic layer of carbon atoms on a honeycomb lattice .",
    "its abundant electronic properties was studied for the first time using the tight - binding approximation @xcite , where the structure of the electronic energy bands and brillouin zones for graphite has been calculated .",
    "although it is a nonrelativistic system , because the fermions move with a speed @xmath4 , which is 300 times smaller than the speed of light @xmath5 , the most remarkable feature of the graphene is that electronic properties can be described by the relativistic dirac equation , as initially pointed by semenoff @xcite .",
    "thus , we can use the well - established methods of quantum field theory in order to study the physics and topological properties of the graphene@xcite .    a special point of interest in graphene",
    "are the topological excitations , which are a direct consequence of its strong chemical bonding @xcite responsible for assuring a stability in the geometrical properties of the underling lattice .",
    "topological defects in graphene can lead to the appearance of an effective gauge field , which can be induced by wrinkles or ripples in its structures @xcite , when the graphene sheet is under tension @xcite , and by displacements along bond directions chamon .",
    "topological excitations of the 2d lattice have its counterpart in the electronic properties of the material .",
    "one example , is the jackiw - pi theory that predicts a dirac zero mode , associated with vortex solutions of the gauge field coupled to the electrons , leading to charge fractionalization @xcite .",
    "the jackiw - pi theory was further generalized to non - chiral models @xcite , where the implications of different gauge groups in the gap formation , considering scalar , vector , and fermion excitations were studied .",
    "in addition the finite - energy vortex solutions of the gauge models having the flux of the electromagnetic fields quantized leads to the bohm - aharonov effect even in the absence of external electromagnetic field . furthermore , we can find an interesting supersymmetric model for graphene in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another example , of interest , is the possibility of solitonic excitations in the 2d lattice from the nonlinear solutions of the field equations in nanoribboins ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the static deformation of the scalar field forming a domain wall in a graphene layer has been analyzed in @xcite , where it was discovered an electronic domain wall spectrum associated with localized electronic states transverse to the wall , and progating only in one dimension .",
    "they studied gapped graphene and found three confined states , one the zero - mode and one in the conducting and valence band . in strained graphene nanoribbon",
    "it was also studied a soliton trap which has electronic states confined to the wall associated with a dirac zero mode solution in the trap @xcite .",
    "the topological confinement of electrons in bilayer graphene was proposed in @xcite , where also the associated spectrum was computed numerically ( for a recent review on the electronic properties of bilayer graphene see @xcite ) .",
    "such theoretical proposal was experimentally verified by observing the valley transport properties at the bilayer graphene domain wall @xcite , and quite recently @xcite it was possible to control these one - dimensional conducting channels in a gapped set up .",
    "the imaging of the confined states was done in @xcite by using scanning tunnelling microscopic , and it was found that the associated conducting channels are mainly located close to the two edges of the domain wall .    we should remind that jackiw and rebbi @xcite in 1976 proposed that fermions can couple to bosonic soliton configurations in non - linear theories in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions . in that work , it was concluded that there is a zero - energy bound state , where the solitons are degenerate doublets with fermion number @xmath6 . following this seminal paper ,",
    "several works have been done with theories involving fermionic fields coupled to topological defects , such studies have included fermions and vortex solutions in abelian and nonabelian gauge theories @xcite , monopoles paolonpb1977 , supersymmetric field theories @xcite , condensed matter and relativistic field theories @xcite , nanorings @xcite , dense quark matter @xcite , aharonov - bohm and aharonov - casher problems @xcite , and topological superconductors @xcite .",
    "motivated by the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , chu and vachaspati chuprd2008 obtained the full spectrum of fermion bound states on a scalar z@xmath7 kink in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "indeed , a decade before in davisprd1988 , it was speculated that the presence of possible fermionic bound states would inhibits the decay of cosmic strings .",
    "the method developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to solve the dirac equation on a kink background has been shown to be extremely powerful .",
    "it enables to obtain analytically the bound state solutions .",
    "later on , dutra and correa @xcite have extended such method to study fermion bound - states and zero modes in the background of kinks within models presenting a structure with a false and a true vacuum .",
    "the spectrum of fermion bound - states of a class of asymmetrical scalar field potentials was analytically obtained in that work .",
    "therefore , the findings of chuprd2008,rafaelplb2010 , in one - dimensional theory , suggest that a domain wall , or a soliton trap for electrons in 2d materials , should also presents an analytical representation of the rich spectrum and the corresponding states adding this feature to the previous finding of @xcite and @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we generalize the analytical methods developed in chuprd2008 for field theories of fermions coupled to scalar kinks in ( 1 + 1 ) to ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions in order to obtain the electronic spectrum in the presence of such topological defect .",
    "we found analytically the excited states trapped by this domain wall , adding those to the ones previously obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we will explore the properties of the spectrum under the influence of constant external fields coupled to the fermions and also the associated impact due to the change of the kinetic term of the scalar field , which is given by lorentz symmetry violation terms in the lagrangian .",
    "our motivation is to check the robustness of the electron spectrum when the properties of scalar field associated with modes of the 2d lattice are modified , in particular with respect to the propagation speed .",
    "in fact , in a pioneer work , kostelecky and samuel @xcite proposed lorentz symmetry violation ( lsv ) in string theories , that was explored in several other physical scenarios ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , some works have explored topological defects in the presence of lsv .",
    "for instance , we can find investigations using monopole and vortices @xcite , in a gauged @xmath8  sigma model @xcite , on topological defects generated by two real scalar fields @xcite , in the propagation of electromagnetic waves @xcite , and in traveling solitons systems lv48 , lv51 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present the theoretical framework of the sme which is going to be analyzed and we find the classical field configurations associated to it . in section iii we compute the full spectrum of two - dimensional fermion states . in section",
    "iv we present our conclusions and final remarks .",
    "in this section , we will show the general form of the relativistic lagrangian for a free spin-@xmath9 dirac fermion @xmath10 of mass @xmath11 in the so - called standard - model extension . at this point",
    "it is important to remark that this theory is based on the idea of spontaneous lorentz breaking in an underlying theory and has been used for various investigations placing constraints on possible violations of lorentz symmetry , several of which depend crucially on the nonrelativistic physics of free massive fermions .",
    "our development is a generalization of the work @xcite , where it was studied the kink - fermion coupling in @xmath12 dimension without lorentz breaking .",
    "we extend the @xmath12 theory studied in @xcite to @xmath13 dimensions including lorentz breaking terms in the model in order to study the electronic properties of 2d materials in the presence of a kink .",
    "the extended lagrangian density , adopted in the present work , has the following form : @xmath14    where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is a real scalar field , @xmath10 is a two - component spinor , @xmath17 is the potential , given in terms of a real scalar field , defining the bosonic sector of the specific model under analysis , @xmath18 is the corresponding yukawa coupling , @xmath19 is a dimensionless coefficient for lorentz violation that preserves _ _",

    "the polarization tensor @xmath19 in the context of 2d materials , represents the change in the scalar mode propagation with the direction , and its speed can be different from the electron fermi velocity .    furthermore , the quantities @xmath20 and @xmath21 are parameters that control the extent of lorentz and _ cpt _ violation in the theory . at this point , it is important to remark that , in the context of the standard - model and quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) extensions , these parameters are determined by expectation values of lorentz tensors arising from spontaneous lorentz breaking in a more fundamental theory . finally , in the above lagrangian density , the @xmath22 are the dirac matrices , which in this work will be written as @xmath23 \\ , \\ \\",

    "moreover , there is reflectional symmetry since @xmath35 and the vacuum manifold has two - fold degeneracy . at this point",
    ", it is important to remember that , in this model , the vacumm has an expectation value @xmath36 @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , in such a vacuum , the elementary fermion will have a mass @xmath38 , where we are taking @xmath39 and @xmath36 @xmath40 . on the other hand ,",

    "thus , the above equation becomes @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "we observe that the dimensionless factor @xmath52 renormalizes the propagation velocity of the scalar mode with respect to the fermion maximum speed , namely @xmath53 this trivially breaks the covariance of the theory under lorentz boosts , but applying it to 2d materials , seems rather natural , as the propagation speed of perturbations in the lattice is not required to be the same as the one for electrons , which in the massless case , corresponds to the fermi velocity , that for graphene is @xmath54 .",

    "there are other interesting topological models of superposition of kinks @xcite , which could generate a potential closer to the experimental set up , however it is not yet known the analytical solutions of the trapped fermionic modes in these non - trivial kink backgrounds .",

    "as it is well known from quantum mechanics in one - dimension , a time - independent attractive potential that tends to zero asymptotically will have at least one bound state .",
    "in addition , the schrdinger - like equation derived for the upper component , has a particular combination of the kink and its derivative , which gives a zero mode @xcite . in general grounds ,",
    "the zero mode solution of the dirac equation for a scalar domain wall presents a zero mode ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and was theoretically discovered in the graphene layer near the wall in @xcite . later on , in ref .",
    "sasnjp10 the zero mode solution was found for the dirac electron for strained graphene nanoribbons in a soliton trap .",
    "therefore , it is guaranteed that @xmath83 has at least one bound state for every @xmath18 , which is the zero mode . moreover , since @xmath83 gets deeper with increasing @xmath18 , there are more and more bound states that appear with larger values of @xmath18 @xcite . the domain wall created by a kink in 2d materials can present a rich spectrum near the wall driven by the effective potentials @xmath87 , illustrated in fig .",

    "the trapping potential gives a width to the charge distribution along the @xmath46 direction , as carried the @xmath147 term .",
    "the lv term in the scalar field lagrangian changes only the velocity of the scalar particle @xmath148 , and in the zero mode solution it only modifies the @xmath149 and the net effect is to broaden or shrink the wave function , as one sees in fig .",

    "for example , by decreasing @xmath149 from the increase of the scalar mode velocity with respect to @xmath163 , the domain wall becomes softer the charge carrier density swallows .",
    "in this work we have investigated the full spectrum of two - dimensional fermion states in a scalar soliton trap with a lorentz breaking background .",
    "it is important to remark that in the context of the novel 2d materials , the lorentz symmetry should not be strictly valid for a field theory that aims to represent the charge carriers close to the dirac points and the collective modes of the lattice represented by bosonic fields .",
    "the dirac electron and bosonic fields reflect the non - relativistic dynamics of the electrons and lattice . in that sense , it is natural that the bosonic fields have propagation velocities different from @xmath163 , and the effect of this kind of lorentz violating effect should be expected when modelling the electronic and lattice excitations in 2d materials , like graphene .",
    "therefore , it is necessary that the lorentz symmetry breaking should be taken into account in the chosen field theory model . having that motivation , we have performed an analysis of this particular lorentz violation effect in a 2d material with a relativistic model of the electrons and fields .",
    "we explore theoretically , the asymmetry between the fermi and scalar mode velocities , in the wave function of the trapped electrons in a kink background . to accomplish",
    "that , we extended the analytical methods developed in the context of 1 + 1 field theories to study the role of confined fermions to the stability of cosmic strings ( see @xcite ) , to explore the effect of the lorentz symmetry breaking in the charge carrier density of 2d materials in the presence of a domain wall with a kink profile .",
    "the width and the depth of the trapping potential from the kink in the presence of the lorentz violating effect associated with the asymmetry of the fermi and scalar mode velocities can be manipulated , and is reflected in the band structure and properties of the levels localized along the kink axis and propagating in the transverse direction .",
    "the present model provides an analytical form for the rich spectrum enlarging a previous findings of the edge states obtained with domain wall @xcite and in particular in strained graphene nanoribbon in a chiral gauge theory @xcite . in future",
    "it will be interesting to generalize our analysis , when transitions between the two valleys are allowed in the field theoretical model , which leads a four dimensional representation of the spinor .    in summary ,",
    "the bound states solutions of dirac equation in the kink background are not destroyed by the lorentz violation due to the different velocities of the dirac electron and boson modes .",
    "one should also expect that theories with gauge fields that aims to describe electronic properties of 2d materials are not necessarily covariant , and lorentz symmetry breaking effects should be taken into account .",
    "we found that by tuning the lorentz breaking parameter , it is possible to change the density of trapped states and make the associated charge carrier density wider or narrow , which may be of interest in actual applications of 2d materials to electronic devices .",
    "reversely , one could also search the consequences of lorentz violation in controlled table top experiments with 2d materials , which could be relevant to understand subtle phenomena in the universe .",
