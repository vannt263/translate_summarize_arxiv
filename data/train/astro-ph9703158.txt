    "present - day galaxies  or their underlying dark matter haloes  are usually considered to be discrete objects , since their densities are `` non - linear '' ( much greater than the average matter density ) .",
    "effective discreteness , due to non - linearity , may play a role on larger length scales . during the period of galaxy formation , many small length - scale perturbations superimposed on high amplitude large length - scale perturbations should have their overdensities boosted into the non - linear regime , whilst small scale perturbations in other regions remain linear .",
    "such ( temporary ) restriction of halo ( or galaxy ) formation to discrete regions may overwhelm the spatial correlation function , @xmath9 expected from linear fluctuation theory , so that the evolution of @xmath10 for haloes ( or galaxies ) during this period may be very different to the linear expectation .",
    "high power on large length scales can thus lead to an effective discreteness which causes a temporary period of `` biassed '' galaxy formation .",
    "other regionally - dependent galaxy formation criteria ( e.g. , a gas cooling condition ) could similarly cause `` biassed '' galaxy formation .",
    ": : : :    if the period of such conditional galaxy formation continues to observable epochs , then existing observations may reveal such an effect .",
    "the purpose of this article is to alert the reader to the degree to which this effect could be important in the interpretation of observations of the normalisation of the faint galaxy angular correlation function , @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are a fixed angle and apparent magnitude respectively .",

    "if the slope , @xmath14 of the initial perturbation spectrum on galaxy scales is similar to that in the cdm model ( @xmath15 ) , then there is relatively more `` power '' on large ( length ) scales than on small scales .",

    " should appear within isolated `` clusters '' in the high density large length - scale perturbations ( cf .",

    "the lack of haloes between these `` clusters '' lowers the mean halo number density .",
    "since the normalisation , @xmath16 ( see eqn  [ e - eps_nu ] ) , of @xmath10 for haloes ( or galaxies ) depends on the mean halo ( or galaxy ) number density , the objects in the `` clusters '' yield high values of @xmath0 i.e. , a very high initial bias , @xmath17 as objects in other regions successively reach the turnaround density ( @xmath18 , @xcite  1968 ; @xcite  1980 , eqn  19.50 ) @xmath19 successively decreases to the near - unity values expected from present - day galaxy observations .",

    "our present ignorance of the redshift distribution of the galaxies in the hdf ( at @xmath83 ) and uncertainty regarding the spatial correlation function behaviour at redshifts lower than @xmath6 mean that the constraints on @xmath6 presented above should not be considered definitive .",

    "these median values are bracketted by our canonical values of @xmath47 ( a ) and @xmath88 ( b ) ( except for @xcite s low redshift component ) , so our estimate of @xmath6 would probably only change a little using more accurate redshift distributions .",
    "more of concern is the low redshift spatial correlation growth , parametrised by @xmath34 .",
    "although the cfrs estimate ( @xcite  1996 ) , based on galaxies with @xmath89 can be summarised by stating that @xmath90 use of the correlation length of @xmath91  mpc and the median redshift ( @xmath92 ) of the `` zero redshift '' stromlo - apm survey ( @xcite  1992 , 1995 ) would imply that @xmath93 ( cf .",
