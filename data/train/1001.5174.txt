    "the understanding of the meson - nucleon interaction as well as studies of meson structure and production mechanisms constitute one of the basic issues of the contemporary hadron physics .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath0 mesons constitute a mixture of the su(3 ) singlet and octet states with almost the same relative contributions of various quark flavours . nevertheless , they have unexpectedly different properties , e. g. as regards the mass @xcite , branching ratios @xcite or production cross sections @xcite .",
    "these differences indicate that also the interaction of @xmath3 and @xmath0 mesons with nucleons may be different . +",
    "up to now , the proton-@xmath3 interaction was studied intensively but still rather large range of values of the scattering length is reported depending on the analysis method @xcite .",
    "the proton-@xmath0 interaction is much less known .",
    "it is only qualitatively estimated ( based on the @xmath4 excitation function ) to be much weaker than for the proton-@xmath3 system  @xcite . in principle , studies of @xmath5 reactions permit information about the proton - meson interaction to be gained not only from the shape of the excitation function but also from differential distributions of proton - proton and proton - meson invariant masses . therefore , in order to investigate the proton-@xmath3 interaction the cosy-11 collaboration performed a measurement  @xcite of the proton-@xmath3 and proton - proton invariant mass distributions close to the threshold at q = 15.5 mev , where the outgoing particles possess small relative velocities . indeed a large enhancement in the region of small proton-@xmath3 and large proton - proton relative momenta was observed .",
    "however , the observed effect can not be univocally assigned to the influence of the proton-@xmath3 interaction in the final state  @xcite , since it can also be explained by the admixture of higher partial waves in the proton - proton system @xcite , or by the energy dependence of the production amplitude  @xcite .",
    "the endeavor to explain the origin of the observed enhancement motivated the measurement of the proton - proton and proton-@xmath0 invariant mass distributions for the @xmath1 reaction presented in this article .",
    "if the enhancement observed in the proton - proton invariant mass distributions for the @xmath2 reaction would be due to the proton@xmath3 interaction then it is expected to be significantly lower for the @xmath1 reaction since the proton-@xmath3 interaction is stronger than the proton-@xmath0  @xcite .    in order to make a model independent comparison of the spectra in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 systems we performed a measurement of the @xmath1 reaction , nominally at the same excess energy as previously measured for the @xmath2 reaction .",
    "invariant mass spectra determined at the same excess energies allow for the comparison without a need for a correction of kinematical factors in the outgoing system .",
    "it is important to stress that the invariant mass distributions for the @xmath1 reaction have not been measured so far .",
    "this is because the total cross section for the @xmath0 meson production in hadron collisions is by more than a factor of 30 smaller than the one for the @xmath3 meson at the same excess energy and additionally the total cross section for the production of the multi - pion background grows by three orders of magnitude when the beam energy increases from the @xmath3 to the @xmath0 production threshold  @xcite .",
    "a determination of the invariant mass spectra reported in this letter was made possible due to stochastic cooling of the proton beam of the cosy synchrotron @xcite and the good momentum resolution ( @xmath8 = 4 mev / c ) @xcite achieved with the cosy-11 detector setup designed especially for measurements near the kinematical threshold .",
    "sufficient statistics were collected to allow the background to be subtracted from the invariant mass distributions .",
    "detailed description of the cosy-11 method used for the @xmath1 reaction measurements can be found in @xcite , therefore , here we concentrate on the background subtraction procedure crucial for the determination of invariant mass distributions .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath1 reaction was conducted using the cooler synchrotron cosy @xcite and the cosy-11 detector setup  @xcite at the proton beam momentum of @xmath9  =  3.260  mev / c , which corresponds to an excess energy of q  =  16.4  mev .",
    "it was based on the registration of the two outgoing protons and reconstruction of their momenta .",
    "the @xmath0 meson is identified using the missing mass technique .",
    "+ figure [ fig : setup ] illustrates a schematic view of the cosy-11 apparatus with a topology of the @xmath10 reaction .",
    "two outgoing protons possessing smaller momenta than the beam momentum are bent in the dipole magnetic field towards the detector system leaving the vacuum chamber through the exit window .",
    "afterwards , they are detected in the two drift chambers , d1 and d2 , in the scintillator hodoscopes s1 and s2 , and in the scintillator wall s3 .",

    "the scintillation detector s4 and the silicon pad detector si are used in coincidence with the d1 , d2 and s1 detectors for the registration of the elastically scattered protons . ]",
    "the target cluster target specifications are described in references @xcite . ]",
    "used during the experiment , was realized as a beam of @xmath11 molecules grouped inside clusters of up to about @xmath12  atoms .",
    "the average density of the target was around @xmath13 atoms/@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "it was installed in front of the dipole magnet as it can be seen schematically in figure [ fig : setup ] .",
    "+ in order to determine the absolute values of the differential cross sections , the time integrated luminosity ( @xmath15 ) has been established by the concurrent measurement of the angular distribution of the elastically scattered protons @xcite .",
    "the extracted value of the integrated luminosity amounts to @xmath16 @xcite .    in order to search for small effects like proton - meson interaction",
    "it is of importance to account for smearing of the measured distributions due to the finite resolution of the detector system , which may alter the shape of the spectrum especially close to the kinematical limit .",
    "therefore , as has been done previously in the analysis of the @xmath2 reaction @xcite , a kinematical fitting of the data has been performed @xcite in order to improve resolution . to this end",
    ", the momenta of the protons were varied demanding that the missing mass of the unregistered particle equals the known mass of the @xmath0 meson exactly .",
    "furthermore , as a result of the fit , only those proton momentum vectors which were closest to the vectors determined from the experiment have been chosen .",
    "the inverse of the covariance matrix was used as a metric for the distance calculation .",
    "the kinematical fit improves the resolution by a factor of 1.5 , as can be seen in figure [ fig : delta_p ] .",
    "after the kinematical fit each event can be characterized by both : experimentally determined momentum vectors and kinematically fitted momenta . in the subsequent analysis",
    "the fitted momenta were used to group events into @xmath17 and @xmath18 intervals and then in order to subtract the background , for each group separately , a missing mass spectrum was determined from experimental momentum vectors .",
    "the available range of @xmath17 and @xmath18 was divided into 22 bins .",
    "the width of the bins ( 0.003  gev@xmath19/c@xmath20 ) was chosen as a compromise between statistics and the experimental resolution .",
    "then , for each bin , the missing mass spectrum was reconstructed and the number of the @xmath1 events was calculated separately for each interval of @xmath17 , @xmath18 . + in figure [ fig : gauss_pol ] , examples of missing mass spectra for two intervals of the invariant proton - proton mass are presented . a clear signal from the @xmath0 meson production is seen on top of a continuous spectrum from the multi pion background .",
    "a  smooth behaviour of the background allows one to interpolate its shape under the @xmath0 peak with polynomial functions that match the data below and above the peak .",
    "the smooth behaviour of the multi - pion background in the peak region was verified by monte carlo simulations @xcite .     as indicated in the figure .",

    "an equally good approximation of the background was also achieved by a fit of the sum of two gaussian distributions  @xcite .",
    "the parameterizations were performed in the entire range of missing mass outside of the @xmath1 signal , and obviously reproduce the background very well .",

    "+ in order to increase the confidence in the estimation of the background behaviour near the kinematical boundary and to estimate the systematic uncertainties due to the choice of the background parameterizations , these distributions were described in an independent way with a second order polynomial divided by the fermi function for the description of the rapid slope at the end of the distributions . to this end",
