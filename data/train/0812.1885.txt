    "a thermodynamically well - posed formulation of plasticity models can be based on the definition of the helmholtz free energy and of the so - called pseudo - potential , from which the flow rules are derived from the generalized normality assumption ( orthogonality principle ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it has been proven in @xcite that the use of pseudo - potentials with an additional dependence on _ state variables _ allows to describe classical plasticity models like prandtl - reuss , non - linear kinematic hardening models @xcite as well as generalized plasticity @xcite and endochronic theory @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the results concerning endochronic theory are recalled in order to expose the proposed approach and then a new description of the model of mrz @xcite is suggested .",
    "under the assumption of infinitesimal and isothermal transformations , the second principle of thermodynamics states that the _ intrinsic _ or _ mechanical  dissipation _",

    "then , let us introduce the _ dissipative _ thermodynamic forces vector @xmath11 belonging to the dual space @xmath12 , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 hence , the inequality ( [ clausiusduhem ] ) can be written as follows @xmath15 where the symbol @xmath16 indicates the scalar product of two objects having the same structure ( * ? ? ?",
