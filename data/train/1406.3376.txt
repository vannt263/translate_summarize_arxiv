    "cells communicate with each other and their surroundings in order to maintain tissue architecture , allow cellular movement , transduce signals and heal wounds  @xcite .",
    "important components in many of these processes are cell adhesion molecules ",
    "proteins on cell surfaces that recognize and bind to ligands on other cells or the extracellular matrix @xcite .",
    "for example , adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelial cells of the blood vessel is a vital step in rolling and capturing of blood cells in wound - healing , and is mediated by the selectin class of receptor proteins  @xcite .",
    "the functional responses of cell adhesion molecules are often mechanically transduced by shear stresses and forces arising from focal adhesions to the cytoskeleton or simply the flow of blood in the vasculature . under stress , molecules undergo conformational changes , triggering biophysical , biochemical , and gene regulatory responses that have been the subject of intense research  @xcite .",
    "lifetimes of adhesion complexes are typically expected to decrease as forces increase  @xcite .",
    "however , the response of certain complexes to mechanical force exhibits a surprisingly counterintuitive phenomenon .",
    "lifetimes increase over a range of low force values , corresponding to `` catch - bond '' behavior  @xcite . at high forces ,",
    "the lifetimes revert to the conventional decreasing behavior , characteristic of a `` slip - bond ''  @xcite .",
    "in retrospect , the plausible existence of catch - bonds was already evident in early experiments by greig and brooks , who discovered that agglutination of human red blood cells using the lectin concanavalin a , increased under shear  @xcite .",
    "although not interpreted in terms of catch - bonds , their data showed lower rates of unbinding with increasing force on the complex .",
    "given the importance of mechanotransduction in cellular adhesions , a quantitative and structural understanding of this surprising phenomenon is imperative .    direct evidence for catch - bonds in a wide variety of cell adhesion complexes have come from flow and afm experiments in the last decade @xcite , along with examples from other load - bearing cellular complexes like actomyosin bonds  @xcite and microtubule - kinetochore attachments  @xcite .",
    "the catch - bond lifetime exhibits non - monotonic biphasic behavior  increasing up to a certain critical force and decreasing at larger forces .",
    "the structural mechanisms leading to catch - bond behavior have largely been elusive , though experiments have provided key insights for selectins  @xcite and integrins  @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "the rupture rate of the ligand from the receptor depends on an angle between two domains in the receptor molecule ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) . conformations with smaller angles detach more slowly than those with large angles . in the case of integrins ,",
    "multiple conformations at varying angles have been crystallized  @xcite , while for selectins , only two ( see fig .  [ f1 ] ) have been found so far in the crystal structures  @xcite . in the absence of an external force",
    ", the molecule fluctuates between conformations corresponding to a variety of angles , including the larger angles from which the ligand can rapidly detach . with the application of force",
    ", the two domains increasingly align along the force direction , restricting the system to small angles and longer lifetimes , until large forces again reduce the barrier to rupture .",
    "previously , theories based on kinetic models with the assumption of a phenomenological bell - like coupling of rates to force  @xcite have been used to explain catch - bond behavior .",
    "however , the parameters extracted from these kinetic models can not be easily related to microscopic physical processes in specific catch - bond systems .",
    "more importantly , such models merely rationalize the experimental data , and do not have predictive power .",
    "the large scale of catch - bond lifetimes , @xmath1 ms , makes it impossible to directly observe unbinding in a realistic all - atom simulation , much less the macroscopic consequences of mutations .    here",
    ", we solve the difficulties alluded to above by creating a new theoretical approach . by building on the insights from the structures of cell adhesion complexes , we introduce a microscopic theoretical model that captures the essential physics of the angle - dependent detachment , and its implications for catch - bond behavior .",
    "taking cue from the crystal structures of selectin and integrin , we construct a coarse - grained energy function for receptor - ligand interactions .",
    "the model yields an analytic expression for the bond lifetime as a function of force , which gives excellent fits to a broad range of experimental data on a number of systems .",
    "the extracted parameters have clear structural interpretations , and their values provide predictions for energetic and structural features like strength of hydrogen bonding networks at the receptor - ligand interface . where estimates of these properties can be directly obtained from crystal structures , our predictions are in remarkable agreement .",
    "the energy scales identified through the model are specific enough to allow predictions for structures not yet crystallized , and suggest novel mutation experiments that would modify catch - bond behavior in quantifiable ways . for the selectins , we predict how a specific mutation in the psgl-1 ligand will alter its unbinding from p - selectin under force , and provide new interpretation of data from l - selectin mutants  @xcite . interestingly , the experimental fits suggest that both p- and l - selectin have a characteristic , ligand - independent energy scale , determined by the chemistry of their binding interfaces . for integrins , we predict the strength of extra interactions that should be observed in a crystal structure of the @xmath0fibronectin complex in an open state .",
    "the generality of the theory is further established by obtaining quantitative agreement for the catch - bond behavior in actomyosin complex .",
    "our theory provides the first structural link between the catch to slip bond transition in cell adhesion complexes , covering a broad range of forces and lifetimes .",
    "* structural basis of catch - bond model : * we now define our model using the structures of p - selectin , which has been crystallized in two conformations : a `` bent '' [ fig .",

    "although ligands can bind to lectin in both conformations , co - crystallization with the ligand ( the truncated n - terminal portion of the glycoprotein psgl-1 ) was achieved only for the extended state . in this latter case , there are two major regions of the lectin domain ( b@xmath2 and b@xmath3 , colored purple in figs .",
