    "hadron interactions are strong and , in principle , should be described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "however , experimental data show that their main features originate from the non - perturbative sector of qcd .",
    "only comparatively rare processes with large transferred momenta can be treated theoretically rather successfully by perturbative methods due to the well - known property of the asymptotical freedom of qcd .",
    "hence , in the absence of methods for a rigorous solution of qcd equations , our understanding of the dynamics of the main bulk of strong interactions is severely limited by model building or some rare rigorous relations .",
    "in fact , our approach to high - energy hadronic processes at present is at best still in its infancy .",
    "as has been learned from experiment , strong interactions of colliding high - energy particles give rise to inelastic and elastic processes . some new particles ( mostly pions )",
    "are produced in inelastic processes , which are the most probable ones , comprising 75@xmath0 to 80@xmath0 of all processes at high energies .",
    "most created particles have comparatively small transverse momenta .    at the same time , in 25@xmath0 to 20@xmath0 of events , the colliding particles do not change their nature and scatter elastically , declining at some angle from their initial trajectories . the only information about this process available from experiment is obtained by the measurement of the differential cross section ( proportional to the probability ) of elastic scattering at some angle at a given energy .    in a very tiny range of extremely small angles ,",
    "the charged particles scatter due to electromagnetic forces .",
    "but the dominant process of elastic scattering due to strong interactions proceeds at somewhat larger angles in the so - called diffraction cone .",
    "the differential cross sections are heavily weighted toward small transferred momenta exhibiting a huge peak .",
    "the scattering angle is still rather small there and becomes smaller and smaller as the energy increases .",
    "the probability of scattering at a given angle in this region decreases steeply , similarly to a gaussian exponential",
    ". noticeably less than one percent of particles are elastically scattered to larger angles outside this diffraction cone .",
    "the gaussian behavior is replaced there by a simple exponential one with some shoulders and ( or ) dips . at ever larger angles ( or transferred momenta ) , a power - like decrease has been observed . at angles close to @xmath2",
    ", some additional flattening is seen .",
    "the elastic cross section ( the integral of the differential distribution over angles or transverse momentum ) depends on the energy of the colliding partners . at high energies",
    ", it shows a steady tendency to become larger with an increase in energy .",
    "we note that the inelastic cross section also increases , such that their sum ( the total cross section ) increases as well .",
    "the process of elastic scattering of hadrons has been studied experimentally in a wide energy region with different initial particles . at high energies of colliding partners ,",
    "the most detailed results are available for the scattering of protons ( @xmath3 ) and antiprotons ( @xmath4 ) on protons .",
    "we mainly discuss these data , sometimes referring to other colliding partners of protons such as pions and kaons .    some surprises in the behavior of the differential cross sections appeared in the 1960s when the very first experimental data on elastic @xmath3 and @xmath5 scattering were obtained at energies between 6.8 and 19.2 gev in the laboratory system @xcite",
    "( the total energy in the center - of - mass system ( cms ) is only @xmath6 4 - 6 gev ! ) .",
    "the diffraction cone behavior changed at larger transferred momenta @xmath7 to a slower @xmath8-dependence .",
    "somewhat later , the energy range was extended to 50 gev @xcite . with the advent of new accelerators , the data for @xmath3 scattering at energies @xmath9 19 , 20 , 23 , 28 , 31 , 45 , 53",
    ", 62 gev were published @xcite and the data for @xmath4 at 31 , 53 , 62 , 546 , 630 , 1800 , 1980 gev @xcite appeared .",
    "the early results are reviewed in refs @xcite .",
    "the compilation of the data can be found in @xcite .",
    "only recently , the results of the totem collaboration at the lhc on elastic @xmath3 scattering processes at @xmath10 = 7 tev were published @xcite .    surely , these results asked for their understanding and theoretical interpretation .",
    "the most important task is to acquire some knowledge about the internal structure of colliding particles by deciphering the information supplied by experimental data about the dependence on energy and transferred momentum .",
    "the transferred momentum is directly related to the size and the structure of those regions inside the hadron that participate in the interaction .",
    "many phenomenological models have been proposed .",
    "most of them aspire to be `` a phenomenology of everything''@xmath11 related to elastic scattering of hadrons in a wide energy range .",
    "doing so in the absence of applicable laws and methods of the fundamental theory , they have to use a large number of adjustable parameters .",
    "the free parameters have been determined by fitting the model results to the available experimental data . even then",
    ", their predictions often fail when a new energy domain becomes available . and",
    "`` the verse''@xmath11 does not grow anymore !",
    "( if not recultivated . )",
    "independent of their success and failure , we are sure that , `` in the long run , the physical picture may be expected to be much more important than most of the detailed computations '' @xcite . in what follows , we mention and discuss many of them .    the scattering of charged particles at extremely small angles is completely dominated by the coulomb amplitude .",
    "the absolute value of the born amplitude is well known .",
    "the phase of the coulomb amplitude varies depending on the model chosen .",
    "however , this variation is rather mild in the considered tiny region of extremely small angles . the interference of the coulomb amplitude with the strong - interaction ( nuclear ) amplitude in the transition region where they are almost equal has been used for the experimental determination of the ratio of the real to imaginary parts of the latter .",
    "this interference also depends on the chosen form of the nuclear amplitude .",
    "theoretically , this ratio can be estimated with the help of dispersion relations .",
    "we briefly discuss this problem and show how the obtained results influence our analysis of scattering at somewhat larger angles .",
    "the most numerous group of models deals with phenomenological attempts to describe the main bulk of elastic scattering at small angles in the diffraction cone . in general , they are based on some geometrical models of particle substructure , with peripheral regions playing the decisive role . the approach using the reggeon ( pomeron ) exchanges is the most popular among them .",
    "the approximately gaussian ( in angles ) shape of the experimentally measured differential cross section in this region has been fitted just in this way .",
    "in addition to it , the simplest classical expressions for diffractive processes and results on the electromagnetic form factors are also used . however , the bold extension of the obtained results to larger angles is usually not very successful , even though some new parameters are introduced .",
    "particles scattered at larger angles give insight into the deeper internal regions of particle structure .",
    "the multiple iteration ( rescattering ) of diffractive processes may explain the region of angles that are somewhat larger than the diffractive ones .",
    "without any additional model building , it can be described as a consequence of the unitarity condition .",
    "the only necessary input is the experimentally known energy behavior of the diffraction cone slope and the total cross section .",
    "it predicts the observed exponential fall - off with angles and damped oscillations imposed on it , which , depending on their amplitudes , lead to shoulders or dips of the differential cross sections .    at somewhat larger angles ,",
    "the elastic processes may be considered to be dominated by the innermost constituents of the colliding particles .",
    "the perturbative qcd approach to hard parton scattering convoluted with some results on the parton structure of colliding particles is then used to describe experimental data .",
    "this approach predicts the power - like angular dependence of the differential cross sections .",
    "it has been seen in experiment .",
    "the dimensional ( or quark ) counting of the number of participating partons has been successful .",
    "the convolution with the internal structure of particles implies some coherence in the behavior of its constituents : all of them should coherently turn at the same angle .",
    "a particle should not be destroyed during the collision , and its internal wave function must be left intact . therefore we can call such processes coherent large - angle scattering .    at angles close to @xmath2 ,",
    "the effects of symmetrization of the corresponding amplitudes may become important and lead to some flattening of the differential distribution .",
    "there are no strict definitions of the lower and upper bounds of these regions .",
    "the diffraction peak shrinks with energy , such that the exponential fall - off with squared transferred momenta @xmath8 terminates at ever smaller values .",
    "correspondingly , the dip after it shifts to smaller values of @xmath7 as does the @xmath12-exponential . at low energies , this regime approximately occupies the interval between 0.8 and 2 gev@xmath13 , while in the lhc , it has moved to 0.4 - 1.5 gev@xmath13 . according to the qcd prejudice",
    ", the scale for parton scattering should be set above 1 gev@xmath13 .",
    "this is actually observed with a power - like decrease starting somewhere around @xmath141.5 - 2 gev@xmath13 at the lhc .",
    "hence , we can speak , at least , about five subregions of elastic scattering .",
    "we mainly discuss three of them : the diffraction cone , the orear regime and coherent hard parton scattering .",
    "the diffraction cone is well known to us from semiclassical effects .",
    "the regions beyond it became noticeable only at energies of colliding particles above several gev , where processes of scattering at sufficiently large angles or transferred momenta are observable .",
    "they persist up to the present lhc energy of 7 tev . who ordered them and whether they will they survive at ever higher energies are also the questions to be discussed in this review .",
    "its structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "the main relations between different characteristics of elastic scattering are presented in section 2 .",
    "then , in section 3 , their global dependences on energy and transferred momenta are discussed , together with our attempts to understand their implications within the simplest approaches .",
    "a more detailed analysis of experimental data in the framework of different theoretical ideas and approximations is the content of section 4 .",
    "finally , the general picture is briefly discussed in section 5 .",
    "we do not consider the scattering of polarized particles , and the spin structure of the amplitude is ignored .",
    "as discussed above , the measurement of the differential cross section is the only source of experimental information about a process .",
    "hence , the main characteristics of hadron interactions directly related to the elastic scattering amplitude , such as the total cross section , the elastic scattering cross section , the ratio of the real to the imaginary part of the amplitude , and the slope of the diffraction cone , are obtained .",
    "the first two are functions of the total energy only , while the others depend on two variables : the total energy and the transferred momentum ( or the scattering angle ) .    the dimensionless elastic scattering amplitude @xmath15 defines the differential cross section as @xmath16 where the ratio of the real to imaginary parts of the amplitude is defined : @xmath17 in what follows",

    "therefore , the masses of the colliding particles can be neglected , and we use the expression @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the energy and the momentum in the center - of - mass system .",

    "the elastic scattering cross section is given by the integral of the differential cross section ( [ dsel ] ) over all transferred momenta : @xmath24    the total cross section @xmath25 is related by the optical theorem to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude as @xmath26    elastically scattered hadrons escape from the interaction region declining mostly at quite small angles within the so - called diffraction cone is described below . ] .",
    "therefore the main focus has been on this region .",
    "as known from experiment , the diffraction peak has a gaussian shape in the scattering angles or exponentially decreases as a function of the transferred momentum squared : @xmath27 in view of relations ( [ sel ] ) , ( [ sigt ] ) , ( [ diff ] ) , any successful theoretical description of the differential distribution must also work in fitting the energy dependences of the total and elastic cross sections .",

    "as we see , the ratio @xmath88 in ( [ rho ] ) is approximated by @xmath89 in the fit ( [ inter ] ) .",
    "this implies that both real and imaginary parts of the nuclear amplitude exhibit the same purely exponential @xmath8-dependence in the interference region ( with the dominance of the imaginary part for small @xmath34 ) .",

    "then we compare this with some trends in present experimental data .    more than half a century ago , it was claimed @xcite that according to the general principles of field theory and ideas about hadron interactions , the total cross section can not increase with energy faster than @xmath92 .",

    "the heisenberg uncertainty relation shows that such a regime favors an exponentially bounded spatial profile of the matter density distribution @xmath96 in colliding particles , such as @xmath97 .",
    "because the energy density is @xmath98 and there should be at least one created particle with mass @xmath99 in the overlap region , the condition @xmath100 leads to @xmath101 and , consequently , to the functional dependence in ( [ asymp ] ) .",

    "after some corrections and glauber model calculations , it results in the @xmath3 inelastic cross section @xmath139 mb . some models @xcite extrapolate their predictions for the total cross section to this energy and obtain a value of about 135 mb .",
    "hence , the ratio of the inelastic to the total cross section could become equal to 0.67 , which is smaller than 0.75 at 7 tev . however , it is premature to reach any definite conclusions because of large errors in the cosmic ray data and the underestimated value of the total cross section predicted at 7 tev by the model @xcite .",
    "the extrapolation to infinite energies done in the same model leads to this ratio estimated as 0.509 , which is compatible with the black - disk predictions .",
    "still , asymptopia is but an elusive concept !",

    "the diffraction peak shrinks about twice from energies about @xmath143 gev , where @xmath144 gev@xmath145 , to the lhc energy , where @xmath146 gev@xmath145 . at isr energies , the slope @xmath147 increases logarithmically .",
    "accounting for lhc data requires a stronger dependence than a simple logarithmic one .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath92 are usually added in phenomenological fits .",
    "even then , predictions @xcite are not completely satisfactory . at present energies , in connection with the power - like preasymptotic behavior of @xmath25",
    ", we could also expect a faster - than - logarithmic shrinkage of the diffraction peak .",
    "the tendency in peak behavior at larger @xmath7 also changes with an energy increase . in the energy region up to isr , it becomes less steep near its end ( see figs 4 , 5 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but its slope increases at the lhc energies . both the minimum and maximum following the peak shift to smaller @xmath7 .",
    "as regardss the behavior of the differential cross section in the function of the transverse momentum behind the maximum , the @xmath8-exponential of the diffraction peak is replaced , according to experimental data , by the @xmath148-exponential at the intermediate angles : @xmath149 the slope @xmath150 in this region also increases with energy , and the whole orear region shifts to the ever lower transferred momenta .    in this connection",
    ", we also note an intriguing property of the ratio @xmath121 , which is closely related to the value of the slope @xmath28 . from table 2 , we see that it is about 1 at @xmath10 = 4 gev , increases to 1.5 at isr energies and then again drops to around 1 at 7 tev .",
    "this ratio , in combination with values of @xmath91 at different angles , determines the slope in the @xmath7-region beyond the diffraction peak at any @xmath30 ( see ref . @xcite and the discussion in the subsection 4.2.2 ) . according to eqs ( [ cst ] ) , ( [ wid ] ) , @xmath127 should decrease and be asymptotically equal to 1/2 for the black disk limit , such that the relation @xmath151 be asymptotically fulfilled . at the lhc energy",
    "7 tev , the coefficient in the right - hand side is still half as much .",
    "however , if the preasymptotic power - like increase in the total cross section accompanied by a slower increase in the slope persists , the tendency to this limit looks quite promising .",
    "the relation between @xmath25 and @xmath28 is also discussed in refs @xcite . in particular , the fits in @xcite correspond to the value @xmath152 at auger energies 57@xmath1536 tev , i.e. lower than 1 at 7 tev .    \\4 . as a function of energy ,",

    "we conclude that even though the qualitative trends may be considered rather satisfactory , we are still quite far from the asymptotic regime , even at lhc energies .",
    "this feature may be connected @xcite with the strong evolution of the parton content of strong interactions at present energies , revealing itself in an increase in the number of active parton pairs inside each proton with energy increase ( higher density ) and a softening of the structure functions , which leads to lower energy shares @xmath163 for each parton pair ( larger radii ) .",

    "the simplest models are demonstrated in table 1 .",

    "the multiperipheral approach developed , for instance , in the framework of the bethe - salpeter equation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) can be considered an attempt to account for the @xmath8-channel unitarity .",
    "nowadays , it is commonly believed that , at very high energies , the total cross section is dominated by peripheral events . in modern parlance , this is related to the long - range nature of the field of `` perturbatively massless '' gluons .",
    "the exchanged boson mass may mimic a nonperturbative mass gap in qcd with the `` effective '' gluon mass of the order of 1 gev and a gluon - gluon correlation length about 0.3 fm .",
    "the pion mass scale is rather small , and more general `` boson '' exchange is preferred .",
    "the weight factors of different mass scales take the impact parameter distribution of the particle opacity into account .",
    "the role of inelastic channels in describing elastic scattering can be revealed by understanding the origin and prescribing a definite shape to the overlap function @xmath171 in the @xmath30-channel unitarity condition ( [ unit ] ) or , equivalently , to its fourier transform in the impact parameter picture . the scattering is mainly diffractive , i.e.",
    ", it is due to the absorption of incoming waves in many open inelastic channels .",
    "its quantitative field - theory treatment presents a serious unsolved problem .",
    "the overlap function contains the sum of products of a matrix element of the inelastic process with a particular final state and the complex conjugate matrix element with the same final particles content .",
    "however , their kinematical difference must be taken into account , due to the fact that the two final protons are scattered at an angle @xmath22 relative to the initial ones .",
    "correspondingly , the overlap of the momentum distributions of the intermediate inelastic @xmath172-particle states is nontrivial kinematically and , what is especially important , the phases of these matrix elements become crucial .",
    "the phases are related to the position in space where particles are produced .",
    "it has been pointed out in many papers @xcite that only the phase cancellation effect , which is closely related to particle correlations in inelastic processes , can lead to a realistic shape of the diffraction cone . the problem of properly accounting for them has not yet been solved .    at the same time",
    ", elastic scattering should be less peripheral because of a larger number of exchanged objects if regarded as an @xmath30-channel iteration of the overlap function .",
    "the great difficulty in transferring large momenta reveals itself already in the sharp shape of the forward diffraction peak .",
    "there have been numerous attempts to understand it in terms of the peripheral approach ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "the interesting predictions of the @xmath8-behavior of @xmath88 at nonforward transferred momenta for different energies are presented .",
    "they are discussed in more details in subsection 4.2.4 .",
    "the regge - pole model is beyond dispute one of the most explored .",
    "it has already been noticed that the notion of regge trajectories has been used in the preceding subsections as well . the only reason to discuss these models there separately was their stronger inclination to the use of nonexponential electromagnetic form factors and geometric pictures in the @xmath30-channel approach . at the same time , reggeon models appeal mostly to the @xmath8-channel approach .",
    "the amplidutes with reggeon exchanges in the @xmath8-channel are the natural candidates for explaining the exponential decrease of the differential cross section ( [ diff ] ) with the squared transferred momentum @xmath230 inside the diffraction cone .",
    "just this shape is typical for them , because it follows from the linearity of regge trajectories .",
    "moreover , they predict the logarithmical increase of the hadronic radii as the energy increases , i.e. , the logarithmical increase in the cone slope @xmath28 or the corresponding shrinkage of the width of the diffraction cone . this prediction is also supported by experiment . in the common regge - pole models ,",
    "the disk becomes larger and slightly more transparent as energy increases .",
    "the standard regge - type models @xcite use the combination of contributions due to the exchange by the ( multicomponent ) pomeron , odderon , and secondary reggeon trajectories corresponding to @xmath231 and @xmath187 mesons with or without the form factors chosen in a simple exponential form or as power - like expressions resembling the electromagnetic structure of colliding partners discussed in the preceding subsection . the price to be paid",
    "is the increased number of adjustable parameters at each step of sophistication . to be more or less realistic , one has to use the knowledge about some of them from other ( independent ? ) experimental results . but even under this condition",
    ", the ambiguity of their choice and sensitivity to fitted parameters leave some freedom in the conclusions .",
    "the amplitudes of @xmath3 and @xmath4 scattering are approximated by the sum of terms corresponding to the leading ( pomeron and odderon ) and nonleading ( @xmath231 and @xmath187 meson ) regge trajectories : @xmath232 , \\label{appbar}\\ ] ] where the labels @xmath233 stand for the relevant contributions .",

    "their nonlinearity may be connected with the two - pion threshold following from the @xmath8-channel unitarity @xcite .",
    "however , there could be double counting of the graphs with pomerons attached on both sides to the pion loop .",
    "this is well known from old peripheral models of inelastic processes , where the self - consistent bethe - salpeter equation had to be used for the proper account of the pion - nucleon vertices .",
    "different forms of nonlinear trajectories are in use .",
    "for instance , the pomeron trajectory is chosen in @xcite with four free parameters as @xmath240 the more complicated nonlinearity was used in @xcite .",
    "however , the use of the pion mass as a scale there is questionable in view of the above discussion .",

    "even the fits with three pomerons are sometimes used @xcite .",
    "the soft pomeron contributes a term with the energy dependence @xmath241 to hadron - hadron total cross sections , and the hard pomeron makes a small ( at present energies ) contribution with a stronger energy dependence @xmath242 .",

    "although the hard - pomeron exchange was unnecessary for describing hadron - hadron total cross sections up to energies @xmath10 below 1 tev , it may reveal itself at lhc energies , as argued in @xcite .",
    "the model in @xcite uses only two terms in the expansion for opacity : @xmath243 where @xmath244 stands for the contribution from single exchanges of reggeons ( two pomerons , @xmath231 , and @xmath187 ) with the adjustable parameter @xmath245 as well as for the triple - gluon exchange of the form @xmath246 needed at larger values of @xmath247 and matched at some @xmath248 to exponential shapes of the diffraction peak and to the dip region . certainly , adding such a term allows fitting the total cross section value at 7 tev , but there is a suspicion that the sharp increase of the hard - pomeron contribution will overpredict the cross sections at higher energies .",
    "the unitarization will become mandatory once again .",
    "the quality of the fit of the differential cross section beyond the diffraction peak is no better than of those fits shown in fig .",

    ", it is often assumed that part of them are known from fits of other characteristics of hadron or electromagnetic interactions at various energies and can therefore be considered known beforehand .    for example , it is claimed that the model in @xcite contains about 15 parameters . in this case , it is quite difficult to find the proper minima for the matrix of @xmath251 values .",
    "it is well known how unstable the final results can be : one has to choose the step - by - step procedure for doing this and use some special computer codes .",
    "there are 25 adjustable parameters shown in table 1 in papers @xcite .",
    "however , they include some values assumed to be apriori fixed in @xcite . at the same time",
    ", additional form factors were inserted in the formulas , albeit with preliminary `` fixed '' parameters .",
    "they were used to fit 982 @xmath3 and @xmath4 data points in a wide energy range . besides the elastic differential cross sections , the total cross sections and the ratios @xmath34 were considered .",
    "the fit in the interference region of coulomb and hadronic amplitudes with the same parameters helped in choosing among the different coulomb phases proposed previously .",
    "a similar situation is seen in the fits in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is claimed that the number of parameters is much less ( 5 only ! )",
    ". however , there are many others ( in particular , concerning the energy behavior and form factors ) that are hidden parameters .",
    "they are held fixed from the very beginning , as was discussed in subsection 4.1.3 .    as mentioned before",
    ", the simple exponential form of the differential cross section in the diffraction cone is quite well described .",
    "this becomes possible mainly due to the @xmath8-shape of the pomeron trajectory ( [ apom ] ) and other reggeons contributions in ( [ areg ] ) .",
    "the fits in this region at the different energies shown , e.g. , in @xcite , are quite impressive .",
    "the evolution of the diffraction cone slope with energy is reproduced ( as described by @xmath252 in ( [ apom ] ) ) .",
    "unfortunately , the variety of forms of pomeron trajectories with different intercepts , slopes , and shapes of residues unitarized in different ways and/or substituted by regge - cuts is so large that it is impossible to show all of them in this review due to the limited space .",
    "the cuts with nonlinear trajectories mimic hard scattering @xcite .",
    "a common problem appears in predicting them at larger angles .",
    "the fit according to the model in @xcite seems to be most successful in predicting the position of the dip and the shape at large @xmath7 but exceeds the absolute value approximately twofold .",
    "the model in @xcite strongly underestimates it , with the wrong position of the dip and much slower decrease at @xmath253 gev@xmath13 .",
    "this is well demonstrated in fig . 2 and is also discussed below .",
    "we mention that all these papers follow the general approach proposed much earlier @xcite .",
    "they just deal with more detailed fits of newly available experimental data .",
    "each incident particle consists of a superposition of fock states with @xmath172 partons @xcite , which are scattered instantaneously and simultaneously by the other particle .",
    "some qcd - inspired models using this statement have been developed .",
    "the role of partons is played by quarks and gluons .",
    "the two competing mechanisms of hadron interactions , the increase in the density ( @xmath125 in table 1 ) and in the radius @xmath106 , determine their specific features .",
    "in qcd , they can be respectively ascribed to the leading order solution of the bfkl equation @xcite and to the long range ( weizscker - williams ) nature of the field of massless gluons .",
    "the density increase due to the bfkl - evolution leads to a power - like increase of the total cross section , which is nonunitary and violates froissart bound ( [ asymp ] ) .",
    "therefore , at the critical density of the order @xmath254 , the density saturation must be taken into account @xcite .",
    "the qcd evolution in all orders in the gluon density but in the leading logarithmic approximations is treated by the jimwlk equations @xcite . with account of multiple scattering effects ,",
    "they can be simplified in the large @xmath255 limit to a single nonlinear bk equation for the gluon density @xcite when the induced field density is small .",
    "the density growth effects are preasymptotic . according to @xcite ,",
    "they are described by a hard pomeron , while the growth of the size of the black saturated regions ( the radius ) is attributed to a soft pomeron .",
    "the hard pomeron manifests itself in small systems or in small subregions inside hadrons .",
    "the soft pomeron appears in hadronic systems of the typical size and is related to an increased size in the impact parameter space .",
    "only the increase due to the perturbative expansion in the transverse plane remains effective .",
    "there is no common consensus about this scenario proposed in ref .",
    "the soft pomeron is often used @xcite in attempts to explain the preasymptotic power growth of cross sections by an additional nonperturbative mechanism superimposed on the bfkl scenario of hard pomeron .",
    "it is ascribed mainly to the density growth of gluon clouds around quarks and not to the spatial scale of the interaction .",
    "even though the size of gluon clouds increases , it is still limited by a short separation from their source",
    ". the proton looks like three valence quarks surrounded by gluon clouds or spots with mean sizes about 0.3 fm , smaller than the proton radius , of the order of 1 fm .",
    "radiation of any additional gluon from the cloud adds the factor @xmath256 to the interaction cross section , and hence their sum gives a power - like term of the form @xmath257 with a large constant term @xmath258 and small @xmath259 . using the standard dipole form factors of protons and quasieikonal unitarization in the impact parameter space , the authors of this two - scale model @xcite fit many distributions with 10 parameters for @xmath8-dependence ( subject to 2 additional constraints ) and some parameters for the @xmath30-dependence .",
    "such fits are , of course , aimed at high energies of colliding protons where the effects of secondary regge - trajectories die out .",
    "they are mainly successful in the diffraction cone and , consequently , in describing the energy dependence of the total and elastic cross sections .",
    "such a form of the total cross section with an energy - independent term @xmath258 was proposed a long time ago @xcite and actively developed later @xcite in the framework of the parton model and semihard qcd , with the gluon - gluon interaction playing the main role .",
    "the main role of gluons is also incorporated in @xcite .",
    "the profile is chosen in a form containing the @xmath260-terms : @xmath261 where the impact parameter distribution functions are @xmath262 and the gluon - gluon interaction cross section is @xmath263 with @xmath264 .    the froissart bound for the total cross section is reproduced with @xmath265 the parameter @xmath266 describes the area occupied by gluons in the colliding protons ( the size effect ) , and @xmath267 is defined via their gluonic structure functions and , therefore , controls their soft gluon content ( the density effect ) .",
    "again , being successful in the diffraction peak with its shape and normalization , the model in @xcite fails to predict the correct behavior of the differential spectrum outside it @xcite . its prediction is more than three times larger than the experimental value at the dip and subsequent maximum , while falling too steeply at ever higher @xmath230 above 1.5 gev@xmath13 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) .    attempts to consider the semihard scattering of quarks and gluons can be found in refs @xcite .    the traditional partonic description of the process is considered in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "the partonic approach with a hard bfkl pomeron can be merged into the domain regulated by the soft pomeron .",
    "the transition from hard to soft is induced by absorptive multi - pomeron effects in a limited energy range .",
    "the evolution produces parton cascades , not strongly ordered in transverse momenta , with hot spots of a relatively small size in @xmath62-space .",
    "the saturation is driven by the enhanced multi - pomeron graphs , also regulating the high - mass dissociation .",
    "the calculations are done with a 3-channel quasi - eikonal unitarization using the opacity formalism .",
    "they reproduce the shapes of the differential cross sections from isr to lhc within the diffraction cone .",
    "another picture was considered in the framework of the functional integral approach in refs @xcite using the model of the stochastic vacuum and making the assumption that the proton has a quark - diquark structure of the color dipole i.e. two quarks out of three are close together in the transverse directions .",
    "a matrix cumulant expansion is used for vacuum expectation values of wegner - wilson loops @xcite related to hadronic amplitudes .",
    "the qcd vacuum parameters ( the gluon condensate or the string tension , the vacuum correlation length , and the parameter due to the non - abelian tensor structure ) , as well as the hadron size , have been used .",
    "the imaginary part of the amplitude in the @xmath62-representation was calculated . its contribution to experimentally measured quantities",
    "was shown to describe the isr and tevatron data in the diffraction peak reasonably well .",
    "a more phenomenological approach to the quark - diquark model was attempted in refs @xcite .",
    "as above , the correlated quark and diquark constituents are considered . according to the detailed analysis performed in @xcite from isr to lhc energies in the region @xmath268 gev@xmath13 ,",
    "the model is able to describe the data quite well , even outside the diffraction peak , except the narrow strip around the dip .",
    "but it shows a much stronger dip ( by several orders of magnitude ) there than the experimentally observed one .",
    "moreover , similarly to the abovementioned calculations , the model ignores the contributions to the real part of the elastic scattering amplitude . as we saw previously",
    ", such contributions can smooth this dip .",
    "if so , their shape should drastically differ from that of the imaginary part , at least in this strip , as happened , for example , in the models with electromagnetic form factors @xcite .",
    "as long ago as the 1960s , experiments on elastic @xmath3- and @xmath5-scattering at comparatively low energies between 6.8 and 19.2 gev in the laboratory system @xcite showed that the steep exponential fall - off of the differential cross section as a function of the squared transferred momentum @xmath7 is replaced by a slower dependence at larger @xmath7 .",
    "they showed that just after the diffraction cone a shoulder was observed and , even more surprising , a behavior exponentially decreasing with the angle or with @xmath12 , which was called the orear regime after its investigator @xcite .",
    "the special session was devoted to these findings at the 1968 rochester conference in vienna .",
    "the shoulder evolved later into the minimum or dip at higher isr energies .",
    "it has also been observed at the lhc , as seen in figs 2 and 3 .",
    "it is interesting that at fnal - isr energies , @xmath10=6 - 60 gev , the exponential fall - off with an increase of @xmath269 was observed up to quite large values of @xmath229 10 gev@xmath13 @xcite , with the exponent in the range from 6.2 to 7 gev@xmath270 ( see table 7 in ref .",
    "it is even larger at the lhc ( about 8 - 9 gev@xmath270 ) .",
    "the region becomes more narrow and shifts to lower values of @xmath7 from 0.5 to 1.5 gev@xmath13 .",
    "the power - like regime already shows up at about @xmath2292 - 2.5 gev@xmath13 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .      from the very beginning ,",
    "it was noticed @xcite that it is possible to fit the differential cross sections at intermediate values of the momentum transfer by the dependence exponential in @xmath12 ( or @xmath22 ) except the relatively small shoulder region .",
    "to take that into account as well , it was primarely proposed @xcite to use fits with gaussian functions with alternating signs of the coefficients directly in the expression for the amplitude .",
    "the similar approach was later advocated in @xcite . in this way",
    ", both the diffraction peak and larger @xmath7-behavior could be described .",
    "no reference to any phenomenological model is given . from the geometrical point of view",
    ", one can imagine an internal structure with envelopes of alternating density .",
    "such an empirical approach has been recently used @xcite for fits of experimental data at isr energies .",
    "the following parameterization of the amplitude is proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath271 , \\label{fms11}\\ ] ] where @xmath272 . the fits at different energies give information about the ratio of the real to imaginary part of the amplitude @xmath273 , besides the values of adjustable parameters @xmath274 .",
    "two different methods were used . in total , there are 14 to 16 free parameters .",
    "the results of nonlinear fits are rather unstable , and the conclusions are somewhat controversial .",
    "in particular , the numbers of zeros in @xmath275 and @xmath276 differ in these methods .",
    "the dominance of the real part of the amplitude at intermediate values of the momentum transfer in one of the methods is not confirmed when the other method is used .",
    "a similar fit was recently attempted and applied to totem data in refs @xcite . the earlier proposal in ref .",
    "@xcite with phenomenologically chosen two @xmath8-exponentials and the relative interference phase responsible for the dip was applied to totem data . using five parameters , it is possible to describe these data in the whole interval of transferred momenta .",
    "we note that , similarly to the model in @xcite , the slope of the second exponential term is chosen several times smaller than that of the main term .",
    "moreover , when the electromagnetic form factors were tried in place of simple exponentials , the fit became worse .",
    "two exponentials without the interference term inside the diffraction peak and a tsallis - type distribution outside it were used in @xcite .",
    "it was possible , with the help of nine free parameters , to fit the data at energies from 19.4 gev to 7 tev .    in some way",
    ", this fit business with no reference to any theoretical model looks more like art than science , especially if no conclusions about the hadron structure are obtained .",
    "such an approach will hardly be conclusive in the future .",
    "theoretical indications of the possibility of a new regime with an increase in transferred momenta were obtained even earlier @xcite .",
    "it was treated as a consequence of the simple iteration of processes approximated by a gaussian within the diffraction cone .",
    "the term @xmath277 in unitarity condition with gaussians inserted into the integrand gives rise to a gaussian with a width , that is twice as big , i.e. to a shape twice as wide as the diffraction cone .",
    "further iterations lead to further widening .",
    "therefore , multiple exchanges were considered .",
    "however , the results did not fit new experimental findings .",
    "this failure was explained as resulting from the improper treatment of the unitarity requirements and incorrect choice of the overlap function .",
    "the droplet model relations between form factors and the elastic amplitude for hadronic scattering at infinite energy ( see eqs ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in ref .",

    "it was predicted that the dip should even disappear at energies higher than @xmath280 gev but , probably , can reappear again at ever higher energies . as we know",
    "now , it is clearly seen at 7 tev .",
    "the imaginary part has been chosen in such a way that it has a zero at the dip .",
    "the absence of additional dips is explained as the deviation of the eikonal from a simple gaussian with some flattening at small impact parameters ( see subsection 4.2.3 ) .",
    "that shows strong sensitivity to the choice of tiny details of the phenomenological eikonal and also agrees with the properties of the overlap function to be discussed in more detail below .",

    "there are oscillations directly imposed on the exponential fall - off with the same exponent",
    ". they should be well pronounced .",
    "so far , no such oscillations have been observed .    a less strong statement about some saturation of the diffraction cone due to multiple pomeron exchanges",
    "is made in refs @xcite .",
    "a theoretical explanation based on the consequences of the unitarity condition in the @xmath30-channel has been proposed in refs @xcite .",
    "the careful fit to experimental data showed good quantitative agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the same approach helps explain the totem findings @xcite ( see fig . 5 below ) .",
    "we consider the left - hand side and the integral term @xmath277 in unitarity condition ( [ unit ] ) at the angles @xmath22 outside the diffraction peak . because of the sharp fall - off of the amplitude with the angle , the leading contribution to the integral arises from a narrow region around the line @xmath284 .",
    "therefore , one of the amplitudes should be inserted at small angles within the cone as a gaussian , while the other is kept at angles outside it .",
    "integrating over one of the angles yields the linear integral equation : @xmath285 where @xmath286 .",
    "it can be solved analytically ( see @xcite for more details ) with two assumptions : that the role of the overlap function @xmath57 is negligible outside the diffraction cone and the function @xmath287 can be approximated by a constant , i.e. , @xmath288=const .",
    "both assumptions are discussed in the next subsections .",
    "it is esay to check that the eigensolution of this equation is @xmath289 with @xmath290 this expression contains the term exponentially decreasing with @xmath22 ( or @xmath250 ) ( orear regime ! ) with oscillations strongly damped by their own exponential factors imposed on it .",
    "these oscillating terms are responsible for the dip .",
    "just this formula was used in refs @xcite for fits of experimental data in a wide energy range .",
    "the ratio @xmath91 was approximated by its average values in and outside the diffraction cone , with @xmath291 , where @xmath292 is treated as the average value of @xmath91 in the orear region .",
    "the fits at comparatively low energies @xcite are consistent with @xmath293 , i.e. , with small values of @xmath292 close to zero .",
    "the great surprise of the fit in @xcite of totem data shown in fig .",
    "5 was the necessity of using the negative value of @xmath294 large in modulus .",
    "being model - independent , this solution suffers from some limitations that are inherent for the unitarity relation , in general , and for the unitarity equation ( [ linear ] ) , in particular .",
    "first , it predicts the dependence on transferred momenta @xmath295 but not the dependence on the collision energy .",
    "second , it is applicable in a restricted ( and not rigorously defined ) range of angles in the orear region .",
    "the elastic scattering differential cross section outside the diffraction cone ( in the orear regime region ) is @xmath296 it has been used for the fit in fig .",
    "only the very first oscillating term in ( [ solut ] ) is taken into account in this expression , because other terms are more strongly damped with @xmath7 .",
    "it is important that the experimentally measured values of the diffraction cone slope @xmath28 and the total cross section @xmath25 of the same experiment mostly determine the shape of the elastic differential cross section in the orear region of transition from the diffraction peak to large - angle parton scattering .",
    "the value @xmath121 is so close to 1 at 7 tev that the fit is extremely sensitive to @xmath287 because @xmath297 in the first term determines the slope in this region .",
    "therefore , it becomes possible for the first time to estimate the ratio @xmath292 outside the diffraction cone directly from fits of experimental data .",

    "( [ linear ] ) is in fact an equation for @xmath298 .",
    "the factor @xmath299 was omitted in this review and all previous papers because it was assumed that `` retaining it would exceed the accuracy of the derivation '' of the equation .",
    "however , it will be worthwhile to take it into account in the future as well , multiplying the right - hand side of ( [ fit ] ) by @xmath300 .",
    "this would slightly improve the fit in fig .",
    "we note that this shape of differential cross section ( [ fit ] ) differs from formula ( [ adya ] ) , first of all , because of the suppression of oscillations by the exponential factors in front of them , which decrease much more strongly than the leading exponent . in ( [ adya ] ) ,",
    "the exponent is common for main and oscillating terms , while in ( [ fit ] ) , the oscillations are strongly damped .",
    "they may give rise to the dip adjusted to the diffraction cone if their amplitude is sufficiently large .",
    "the small secondary damped oscillations at larger values of @xmath7 have been seen at comparatively low energies ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) but have not yet been noticed at the lhc .",
    "we stress that the fit ( [ fit ] ) contains only three adjustable parameters : the overall normalization @xmath301 , the amplitude of oscillations @xmath302 , which determines the depth of the dip , and @xmath287 , which helps find the ratio @xmath292 outside the diffraction peak from the slope of the differential cross section there .      both the overlap function and the eikonal are subject to the unitarization procedure , albeit in somewhat different approaches .",
    "therefore , it is instructive to compare their different forms .",
    "we discuss what shapes of the overlap function can be considered as suitable for further use .",

    "the quantitative comparison with experimental data is more difficult because of much smaller values of the differential cross sections in this region and , correspondingly , larger error bars .",
    "the new experimental data of the totem collaboration at the lhc about elastic scattering of protons at an energy of 7 tev have revived interest to these processes .",
    "the picture of very short - wavelength hadron collisions has become available , adding to our insight into the spatial structure of colliding particles and providing new intrinsic information pertaining to very short - distance interactions .",
    "the total and elastic cross sections show a stable increase with energy . the share of elastic processes increases .",
    "the differential cross section has very intriguing properties .",
    "the exponential @xmath7-decrease persists at small transferred momenta , analogously to lower - energy data .",
    "but the diffraction cone slope is larger compared with low energies ; it is stable up to transferred momenta @xmath338 gev@xmath13 , then this peak steepens and a dip appears at @xmath167 gev@xmath13 , with a subsequent maximum at @xmath168 gev@xmath13 . at somewhat larger angles ,",
    "the exponential in @xmath12-regime prevails .",
    "it is replaced by the @xmath169-behavior at ever larger transferred momenta @xmath399 gev@xmath13 . at the same time , we are waiting for measurements at extremely small angles in the interference region of coulomb and nuclear amplitudes to gain some knowledge about the real part of the forward scattering amplitude .",
    "it would be extremely interesting to learn its energy behavior and check our predictions from the dispersion relations .",
    "the steeper slopes of the diffraction peak and of the orear region at higher energies , and , correspondingly , their smaller extensions clearly demonstrate that it becomes more and more difficult for a high - energy particle to preserve its identity when scattering at larger transverse momenta .",
    "this increase in the total cross section and , especially , in the share of the elastic cross section , as well as the peculiar change of regimes in the @xmath7-behavior of the differential cross section , require a theoretical interpretation .",
    "short of a complete theory of hadron dynamics , we have to turn our attention to phenomenological models and some rare rigorous theoretical relations .",
    "the region of large transferred momenta became an occam razor for them , as explained above .",
    "the geometric picture of the internal structure of protons and their collisions requires larger disk radii increasing with energy .",
    "their blackness increases as well .",
    "some separate subregions of different sizes and opacity are considered .",
    "the impact parameter approach is decisive in deciphering this structure . at isr energies ,",
    "the increase of the total cross section was attributed to some peripheral regions of nucleons .",
    "it is important to juxtapose these findings with the lhc data .",
    "the approach to the black - disk asymptotic limit has become very interesting .",
    "the proposal of geometrical scaling reducing the number of independent variables is under investigation . at the same time",
    ", the scaling law may happen to be different from the geometrical scaling .",
    "there are many phenomenological models , at our disposal , but it is still difficult to choose any particular one among them .",
    "most of them are quite successful , albeit with many adjustable parameters , in describing the energy behavior of the cross sections and the main bulk of the elastic processes in the diffraction cone , but fail in their predictions outside it",
    ". the dynamical origin of many assumptions is still missing .",
    "the small details of the suspected break at small @xmath8 , of the steepened slope and of possible weak oscillations over a smooth exponential behavior of the diffraction peak are under investigation .",
    "there are predictions of several dips and/or visible oscillatory behavior imposed on the trend of a generally decreasing dependence on @xmath7 , which appear at larger transferred momenta . as an example , in fig .",
    "11 borrowed from @xcite the results of some model predictions for the differential cross section of proton - proton scattering at @xmath400 tev are shown up to quite high values of @xmath401 gev@xmath13 .",
    "they differ significantly , and further accurate experimental data expected to be obtained in 2015  2016 will surely be decisive in the choice of a model ( if any ! ) .",
    "the experience with unsuccessful predictions at 7 tev in the region outside the diffraction cone is not very encouraging .",
    "the problem of the behavior of the real part of the elastic scattering amplitude at nonforward transferred momenta is becoming very important . while the imaginary part of the amplitude dominates at small angles in the diffraction cone , there are indications that just the real part prevails at high transferred momenta .",
    "the unitarity condition indicates some ways to solve this problem . however , there are other approaches with different conclusions .",
    "another important unsolved problem is the behavior of the overlap function .",
    "it certainly dominates in the diffraction cone , but seems to become negligibly small outside it .",
    "the phases of matrix elements of inelastic processes must play an important role in attempts to recover its shape .",
    "however , this presents the extremely difficult theoretical task of modeling them .",

    "<S> colliding high energy hadrons either produce new particles or scatter elastically with their quantum numbers conserved and no other particles produced . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the latter case here . </S>",
    "<S> although inelastic processes dominate at high energies , elastic scattering contributes considerably ( 18 - 25@xmath0 ) to the total cross section . </S>",
    "<S> its share first decreases and then increases at higher energies . </S>",
    "<S> small - angle scattering prevails at all energies . </S>",
    "<S> some characteristic features are seen that provide informationon the geometrical structure of the colliding particles and the relevant dynamical mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> the steep gaussian peak at small angles is followed by the exponential ( orear ) regime with some shoulders and dips , and then by a power - law drop .    </S>",
    "<S> results from various theoretical approaches are compared with experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> phenomenological models claiming to describe this process are reviewed . </S>",
    "<S> the unitarity condition predicts an exponential fall for the differential cross section with an additional substructure to occur exactly between the low momentum transfer diffraction cone and a power - law , hard parton scattering regime under high momentum transfer . </S>",
    "<S> data on the interference of the coulomb and nuclear parts of amplitudes at extremely small angles provide the value of the real part of the forward scattering nuclear amplitude .    </S>",
    "<S> the real part of the elastic scattering amplitude and the contribution of inelastic processes to the imaginary part of this amplitude ( the so - called overlap function ) at nonforward transferred momenta are also discussed . </S>",
