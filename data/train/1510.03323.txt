    "let @xmath0 be a real - analytic levi - nondegenerate hypersurface .",
    "the celebrated theory due to chern and moser ( see also earlier work of poincar @xcite and cartan @xcite ) gives a beautiful exposition of the fact that only a very rare such @xmath1 is locally biholomorphically equivalent to the 3-dimensional sphere @xmath2 . it also demonstrates the exceptional role of the sphere @xmath3 as the _ model _ for all levi - nondegenerate hypersurfaces in @xmath4 .",
    "one of the central questions arising in connection with that is the problem of an _ effective _ identification of those levi - nondegenerate hypersurfaces which are locally biholomorphically equivalent to @xmath3 ( so - called _ spherical hypersurfaces _ ) .",
    "chern and moser provide a certain answer in this direction .",
    "first , the differential - geometric construction of chern ( see also @xcite ) gives an algorithm for computing the _ cr - curvature _ of a levi - nondegenerate hypersurface , vanishing of which is equivalent to the sphericity .",
    "( we note that the local sphericity of a real - analytic levi - nondegenerate hypersurface is equivalent to its global sphericity , see , e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", moser provides a ( convergent ) normal form construction for a real - analytic levi - nondegenerate hypersurface . in this language",
    ", the sphericity reads as vanishing of all the `` resonant '' terms @xmath5 moser s distinguished coordinates ( see the formula in section 4 below ) .",
    "one of the remaining problems in chern - moser s theory is to find an _ elementary geometric _ characterization of sphericity of a real hypersurface .",
    "that is , we are searching for elementary geometric properties of a real hypersurface @xmath0 , guaranteeing its sphericity on the one hand , and not requiring a transfer to any special coordinates on the other hand .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , _ no _ results in this direction exist till present , and it was commonly expected that the sphericity can _ not _ be characterized any simpler than via chern s tensor invariants or moser s normal form .",
    "an elementary geometric characterization under discussion is not only interesting by itself , but is also motivated by the fact that both chern s curvature and moser s normal form constructions are usually difficult to carry out for a concrete levi - nondegenerate hypersurface due to their very high computational complexity . checking the sphericity even of very simple hypersurfaces ( e.g. , real - algebraic ones ) remains a very difficult task in general ( the complexity of chern s approach can be seen , for example , from the respective computation for real ellipsoids @xcite ) .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to provide such a , very unexpected , geometric characterization of sphericity .",
    "the associated geometric object that we use is a useful tool due to segre and webster which we address as _ the segre - webster family _ of a real hypersurface ( note that the latter object is often addressed in the literature as merely _ the segre family _ ; we refer to below for the history and terminology , and to section 2 for details of the concept and properties ) .",
    "our main result below further demonstrates the exceptional role of segre - webster families for cr - geometry . informally speaking",
    ", the result says that a real - analytic levi - nondegenerate hypersurface @xmath0 is spherical near a point @xmath6 if and only if its segre - webster family near @xmath7 ( which is a @xmath8-parameter family of planar complex curves ) satisfies one of the configuration theorems of projective geometry : the _ desargues theorem_. for convenience of the reader , we provide below a picture illustrating the desargues theorem .",
    "the lines on the picture are arbitrary real or complex lines in @xmath9 or @xmath10 respectively .",
    "the assertion of the theorem is that the three points @xmath11 obtained from the three distinct lines @xmath12 with @xmath13 and three pairs of points @xmath14 as shown on the picture ,    _ must lie on the same line @xmath15 . _    here the seven points @xmath16 are assumed to be pairwise distinct .    in what follows",
    ", we call the latter property of a configuration of seven points _ the desargues property_.    let us now consider a more general ( local ) setting , where the family of lines on the plane is replaced by a ( local ! ) @xmath8-parameter holomorphic family of complex curves , behaving similarly to the family of lines on the plane . more precisely , we consider a family of complex curves @xmath17 parameterized by a parameter @xmath18 running an open set @xmath19 , such that :    \\(i ) each of the curves @xmath20 is defined in a polydisc @xmath21 centered at a point @xmath7 ;    \\(ii ) the holomorphic parameter @xmath18 lies in a polydisc @xmath22 centered at a point @xmath23 , @xmath24 and the parameterization map @xmath25 is holomorphic and one - to - one in @xmath26 ;    \\(iii ) for all @xmath27 and all slopes @xmath28 sufficiently close to the slope @xmath29 of @xmath30 at @xmath7 , there exists one and only one curve @xmath31 from @xmath32 , passing through @xmath33 and having the slope @xmath28 at @xmath33 .    in other words ,",
    "the lifting of the @xmath8-parameter family @xmath32 to the bundle of @xmath34-jets of planar complex curves forms a foliation near a point in the @xmath34-jet bundle corresponding to @xmath35 .    in what follows",
    "we call every family satisfying ( i)-(iii ) _ a transverse family_.    as a well known fact ( e.g. , @xcite,@xcite ) ,    _ the segre - webster family of a real - analytic levi - nondegenerate hypersurface @xmath0 near every point @xmath6 is a transverse family_.    as follows from the definition of a transverse family , after possibly shrinking the polydiscs @xmath36 , we have the following property : through every two points @xmath37 there exists at most one curve of the family passing through @xmath38 .",
    "thus , we can correctly define the unique intersection point @xmath39 of two curves @xmath40 in a transverse family @xmath32 , as well as the unique curve @xmath41 passing through two given points @xmath37 , if the latter objects exist .",
    "we call a configuration of seven distinct points @xmath42 in @xmath43 _ an admissible configuration _ , if each of the triples of points @xmath44 belongs to some curve in @xmath32 , all the intersections @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are non - empty , and all the three curves @xmath48 , and @xmath49 are non - empty .",
    "it then makes a complete sense , replacing `` lines '' by `` cuves of a transverse family @xmath32 '' , to ask whether an admissible configuration has the desargues property in the above sense ( that is , whether @xmath50 lie in the same curve in the family @xmath32 ) .",
    "we now do the following simple observation : if a transverse family of curves is locally mappable onto the family of straight lines , then ( after shrinking the basic neighborhood ) for all admissible configurations for @xmath32 the desargues property must hold ( as it holds for the transformed family ) . in particular , if @xmath32 is the segre - webster family of a real hypersurface @xmath1 , then in the new coordinates the segre - webster varieties are straight lines and , as a well known fact , the image of @xmath1 lies in a real hyperquadric in @xmath10 . hence @xmath1 is spherical , and we conclude that    _ the desargues property is necessary for the sphericity_.    our main result says that , in fact , the desargues property is also sufficient here .    [ theor1 ]",
    "let @xmath0 be a real - analytic levi - nondegenerate hypersurface , and @xmath51 .",
    "then the germ @xmath52 is spherical if and only if the segre - webster family of @xmath1 near @xmath33 has the desargues property for all admissible configurations .",
    "[ web ] segre - webster families ( normally addressed in the literature as merely _ segre families _ ) were discovered in the work @xcite of segre , and revisited more recently by webster @xcite .",
    "webster used them in @xcite for proving several celebrated theorems in cr - geometry concerning mappings of algebraic hypersurfaces . since the work @xcite , segre families is a key tool for modern cr - geometry ( see , e.g. , @xcite,@xcite and references therein ) . during the conference in madison ,",
    "wisconsin in march 2015 dedicated to the 70th anniversary of webster , we agreed with my colleagues that , taking into account the exceptional role of webster in discovering and pursuing segre families as one of the central objects in cr - geometry , it would be fair to address segre families as _ segre - webster families_. thus , throughout the paper we use the latter term only .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a background information on segre - webster families . in section 3",
    "we show that any transverse family having the desargues property admits a special family of symmetries , generalizing a certain @xmath34-parameter group of projective transformation ( these symmetries are in fact _",
    "parabolic maps _ , in the dynamical terminology ) .",
    "finally , in section 4 we show that symmetries of the segre - webster family obtained in section 3 can not exist for a non - spherical hypersurface , and this proves .",
    "importantly , the symmetries we deal with here are _ not _ automorphisms of the hypersurface @xmath1 but are merely that of the segre - webster family , that is why one needs to develop here a rigidity theory _ for transverse families of planar curves _ ( rather than real hypersurfaces ) .",

    "as was explained in the introduction , the necessity of the desargues condition in is obvious , that is why the rest of the paper is dedicated to the proof of sufficiency of the desargues condition in .    throughout this section",
    "we consider a transverse family @xmath32 in a polydisc @xmath43 centered at @xmath7 such that all admissible configurations of seven points in @xmath43 for @xmath32 have the desargues property . in the latter",

    "( here we keep the notations from the introduction ) .",
    "the curves of the family @xmath32 are called in what follows _",
    "@xmath32-lines_.    we then construct a family of automorphisms of @xmath32 , _ preserving the distinguished @xmath32-line @xmath15_. the idea behind that is to think of @xmath15 as the `` line at infinity '' , so that automorphisms preserving @xmath15 become analogues of affine transformations .",

    "we emphasize again that @xmath110 is defined so far on @xmath134 only . clearly , @xmath110 is holomorphic wherever it is defined ( as follows from the fact that the family @xmath32 is holomorphic and from the implicit function theorem ) .        to extend @xmath110 to @xmath127",

    "since all @xmath183 are distinct , and neither of them is the identity ( for a fixed @xmath188 and various @xmath189 ) , we get a @xmath34-parameter family of local automorphisms of @xmath32 , fixing @xmath7 , different from the identity , having the identity linear part at @xmath7 , and fixing each point in @xmath15 . from here",

    "we further observe that any automorphism @xmath216 of the segre - webster family @xmath32 preserving the origin and the @xmath32-line @xmath217 generates a ( unique ! ) similar transformation @xmath218 in the space of parameters such that the resulting product transformation @xmath219 preserves @xmath214 .",

    "any such map , preserving the origin and satisfying , is clearly given by .",
    "at the same time , it is easy to check that the product map @xmath288 preserves the `` model '' manifold @xmath289 corresponding to the family of straight lines in @xmath4 .",
    "thus ,      we continue the proof , still considering the initial automorphism of @xmath214 satisfying with some @xmath265 , as well as an automorphism of the model @xmath290 _ corresponding to the same value of @xmath291_. note that , since @xmath214 and @xmath290 coincide up to weight @xmath292 , the weight @xmath236 equations to compute @xmath285 are the same for the model and the non - model cases respectively , and we conclude that each collection @xmath285 with @xmath293 simply _ coincides with that for the map _ with the same value of @xmath291 .",
    "this gives the desired answer for @xmath285 with @xmath286 .",
    "next , for @xmath294 and @xmath295 is is straightforward to check that the equations to obtain @xmath285 are identical to that for the case of @xmath290 , so that the corresponding collections of weighted polynomials again _ coincide _ ( the resonant terms @xmath296 cancel each other in the @xmath241-th and @xmath297-st identity respectively ) .",
    "finally , we consider the weight @xmath298 .",
    "let us consider first the weight @xmath299 identity for the model @xmath290 .",
    "it has the form : @xmath300 where @xmath270 is the above linear operator , and @xmath301 is some precise polynomial of @xmath302 and their derivatives , exact form of which is of no interest to us .",
    "now , returning to the case of the non - model manifold @xmath214 and considering the weight @xmath299 in , we obtain : @xmath303 ( in this step the cancellation of resonant terms does not happen thanks to the non - linear terms in @xmath237 ! ) .",
    "importantly ,        to show now that the identities , can not hold simultaneously , we make a simple observation that the difference of the two collections @xmath276 ( having the same @xmath265 ) corresponding to @xmath214 and @xmath290 respectively belongs to the above space @xmath275 ( since this difference satisfies with @xmath266 ) .",
    "hence , subtracting from and using the notations of , we get an identity in which the left - hand side is in @xmath277 , while the right hand side is in @xmath281 .",
    "( the latter follows from the fact that , as the explicit description of @xmath281 and the normal form show , we have the inclusions @xmath305 this , in view of and the fact that @xmath265 , implies @xmath306 and gives a contradiction ."
