    "quantum coherence at the macroscopic and mesoscopic scales is a topic of interest in a variety of fields .",
    "a well - known example is the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) formed in a dilute gas of identical atoms , when the temperature is dropped below a transition temperature @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "one interesting question is , at temperatures above and within the same order of magnitude of @xmath0 , whether the atoms may possess quantum coherence more than that expected for thermal atoms .",
    "in fact , at temperatures a little above @xmath0 , the stochastic - gross - pitaevskii - equation approach predicts that a fraction of the atoms may lie in a bec - type state @xcite .",
    "some other approaches give more or less similar predictions , restricted to the region around @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , for temperatures several - times higher than @xmath0 , these theoretical approaches do not give a clear prediction for the above - mentioned quantum coherence .",
    "interestingly , on the other hand , experimental evidence exists for the above - discussed quantum coherence .",
    "it is given by a recent experiment , in which contrasts of the interference patterns formed by a dilute gas of atoms were measured @xcite .",
    "it was observed that , at some temperatures above @xmath0 and under some values of controlling parameters , the measured contrasts are obviously higher than those predicted for thermal atoms .",
    "this implies the existence of quantum coherence more than that expected for thermal atoms .",
    "theoretical explanation to this extra coherence is still absent and a purpose of this paper is to take a first step to it .    to explain the approach we are to take ,",
    "let us first consider a gas of thermal ( identical ) atoms at a temperature much higher than @xmath0 . at such a high temperature ,",
    "the indistinguishability of the atoms usually do not have a significant effect and , as a result , the atoms can be treated effectively as distinguishable particles . as an approximation , a single atom in the gas can be treated as a quantum brownian particle interacting with a thermal bath .",
    "below , we call this approximation the distinguishable - particle approximation",
    ". behaviors of a quantum brownian particle have been studied extensively in passed years ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "due to environment - induced decoherence @xcite , the reduced state of the particle may approach an approximately - diagonal form in a basis given by gaussian wave packets @xcite , which is usually referred to as preferred ( pointer ) basis @xcite .",
    "this implies that the atom can be effectively described by a mixture of gaussian packets .",
    "the width of a gaussian wave packet discussed - above gives a measure to the coherence length of the related atom .",
    "it can not keep constant due to wave - packet expansion @xcite , in other words , it should be distributed over some finite region .",
    "an intriguing question is what may happen to those atoms whose coherence lengths are of the scale of the mean neighboring - atomic distance .",
    "the above - discussed distinguishable - particle approximation fails for these atoms , since the related gaussian packets usually have non - negligible overlap with those of the neighboring atoms",
    ". it would be reasonable to expect that these atoms , at least some of them , may possess coherence more than that expected for thermal atoms .    at high temperatures , the proportion of the above - discussed atoms with long coherence lengths should be too small to induce any notable effect in most cases .",
    "however , when the temperature drops to the order of @xmath0 , attention should be paid to them .",
    "in fact , as well known , when the temperature becomes close to @xmath0 , the thermal de broglie wavelength reaches the scale of the mean neighboring - atomic distance @xcite .",
    "in addition , the mean coherence length of the atoms , given by the mean width of the related gaussian wave packets , is of the order of the thermal de broglie wavelength @xcite .",
    "these two points suggest an intuitive picture for a gas to enter into a bec state , that is , loosely speaking , it may happen when the mean coherence length obtained under the distinguishable - particle approximation reaches the scale of the mean neighboring - atomic distance .",
    "based on this picture , it would be reasonable to assume that ( part of ) the atoms with sufficiently long coherence lengths may lie in some bec - type state .    in this paper",
    ", we show that , making use of the above - discussed assumption about the existence of some bec - type state for some atoms , a semi - quantitative explanation can be gained to main features of the experimentally - observed , unexpectedly - high contrasts discussed above . specifically , the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sect - ana ] , we discuss two models for a gas at temperatures above @xmath0 : a simple thermal model , in which the atoms are treated as thermal atoms , and a hybrid model , in which most of atoms are thermal atoms while a small proportion of the atoms lie in a bec - type state . based on decoherence arguments , we derive an expression for the temperature - dependence of the proportion of the atoms with long coherence lengths . in sec.[sect - expm ] , we discuss predictions of the hybrid model for the contrasts of the interference patterns observed in the experiments in ref.@xcite and compare the predictions with experimental results . finally , concluding remarks and discussions are given in sec.[sect - conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we discuss two models for a gas of @xmath1 identical atoms : a simple thermal model for high temperatures in sec.[sect - simple - model ] and a hybrid model for temperatures above and of the order of the bec - transition temperature @xmath0 in sec.[sect - hybrid - model ] .",
    "the temperature - dependence of the small proportion of the atoms with long coherence lengths is discussed in sec.[sect - pcon ] .",
    "we neglect the internal motion of the atoms . at high temperatures with @xmath2 , as discussed in sec.[sect - intro ] , one may take the distinguishable - particle approximation . at the end of this section , we discuss that this approximation leads to a self - consistent picture for the motion of most of the atoms .",
    "we use @xmath3 to denote a considered , central atom and use @xmath4 to denote the rest of the atoms , as the environment of @xmath3 .",
    "the state of the total system is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "assuming that the environment can be regarded as a heat bath , the central atom behaves like a particle undergoing a quantum brownian motion , which has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "coherent states are known to give approximate preferred states , in which the reduced density matrix ( rdm ) of the central particle , @xmath6 , approaches an approximate diagonal form beyond some finite time scale @xcite , @xmath7 here , @xmath8 indicates a coherent state , which is a gaussian wave packet in the case studied here , centered at @xmath9 in the phase space , with a fixed dispersion @xmath10 in the coordinate space .",
    "this form of the rdm suggests that , effectively , the central atom may be described by a mixture of gaussian wave packets , with probabilities @xmath11 .",
    "if further assuming that @xmath12 has reached a stationary solution with a boltzmann form , one gets a simple thermal model for the atoms in an equilibrium state , which has been used in ref.@xcite .    in eq.([rho - diag ] ) , the fixed dispersion @xmath10 is temperature - dependent @xcite , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the thermal de broglie wavelength . here ,",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the planck constant and the boltzmann constant , respectively .",
    "as pointed in ref.@xcite , due to wave packet expansion , the dispersion of the packet in fact can not keep constant .",
    "the above - discussed fixed - value @xmath10 can be regarded as corresponding to the mean value of the dispersion . at @xmath2",
    ", @xmath10 is much smaller than the mean distance between neighboring atoms , denoted by @xmath17 in what follows . as a result , most of the gaussian packets of neighboring atoms have negligible overlap in the coordinate space .",
    "this justifies validity of the distinguishable - particle approximation .",
    "when the temperature @xmath18 drops to the order of @xmath0 , the dispersion of the packets discussed above reaches the order of @xmath17 on average , hence , its variation can no longer be neglected . to study properties of the central atom in this case ,",
    "we expand the state vector of the total system in the following form , with the dispersion as a variable , denoted by @xmath19 , @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the corresponding components of the environment .",
    "we assume that decoherence has happened , such that gaussian wave packets are approximately preferred states @xcite and the components @xmath21 of the environment satisfy @xmath22 for @xmath23 not close to @xmath24 and for @xmath19 not close to @xmath25 .",
    "then , the rdm has approximately the following ` diagonal ' form , @xmath26 where @xmath27 according to eq.([rho - ax ] ) , effectively , the atom can be regarded as lying in a mixed state , i.e. , in a mixture of @xmath28 with probabilities @xmath29 .    in the mixed - state description",
    "discussed above , those gaussian wave packets @xmath30 with large dispersions , @xmath31 , may induce a problem .",
    "that is , they usually have non - negligible overlap with gaussian wave packets of the neighboring atoms , as a result , symmetrization of the whole wave function does not allow to treat the corresponding atoms as distinguishable particles .",
    "this is in confliction with the distinguishable - particle approximation , which is the starting point of the above approach .",
    "this confliction suggests that the related atoms may possess quantum coherence more than that expected for uncorrelated thermal atoms .",
    "then , what type of quantum coherence may the corresponding atoms have ?",
    "as discussed in the section of introduction , for temperatures a little above @xmath0 , some fraction of the atoms may lie in a bec state .",
    "it would be natural to expect that , at temperatures not so close to @xmath0 but still of the order of @xmath0 , a small proportion of the atoms may still lie in some bec - type state .    to be specific",
    ", we recall that , as discussed previously , loosely speaking , bec transition happens when the mean coherence length of the atoms obtained in the distinguishable - particle approximation , which is of the order of the thermal de broglie wavelength , reaches the order of the mean neighboring - atomic distance @xmath17 .",
    "based on this understanding of bec transition , we make the following conjecture , which is the basic assumption of this paper . that is , approximately",
    ", a bec - type state may develop among those atoms connected by the relation of mutual - coherence . here",
    ", two atoms are said to have a _ mutual - coherence _",
    "relation , if they are associated with two gaussian wave packets whose coherence lengths are longer than the distance between the centers of the two packets .",
    "two atoms in mutual - coherence with a same third atom are regarded as being in mutual - coherence , too .    to be quantitative ,",
    "the probability for an atom to have a coherence length characterized by @xmath19 is written as @xmath32 we use @xmath33 to denote the probability for an atom to lie in a bec - type state .",
    "the above conjecture implies that this probability should be proportional to the probability for the gaussian wave packets to have dispersions of the order of or larger than @xmath17 .",
    "hence , it can be written as @xmath34 where , @xmath35 is of the order of @xmath17 . in what follows , for simplicity in discussion ,",
    "we assume that @xmath36 , since generalization of the results to be given below to the case of @xmath35 not equal to @xmath17 is straightforward .    in eq.([p - con ] ) , we introduce a parameter @xmath37 , since according to the above conjecture only atoms connected by the relation of mutual - coherence may lie in the same bec - type state .",
    "obviously , @xmath38 . at temperatures @xmath18",
    "not high , there exists only one big body of the atoms that are connected by the mutual - coherence relation . in this case , @xmath37 is approximately temperature - independent . in",
    "what follows , we discuss this case @xcite .    for @xmath39 ,",
    "there exist atoms associated with gaussian wave packets possessing large dispersions , which do not contribute to the bec - type state .",
    "since the population of these atoms is small and the coherence among them is not as strong as that in the bec - type state , it would be reasonable to expect that these atoms should give small contribution to the contrast of the interference pattern formed by the gas .",
    "hence , to simplify the discussion , as an approximation , we assume that these atoms can be treated as thermal atoms .",
    "finally , we get the following hybrid model for a gas in an equilibrium state with a temperature @xmath18 above and of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "that is , part of the atoms associated with @xmath30 of @xmath31 lie in a bec - type state , while , other atoms are thermal atoms described by the simple thermal model discussed in the previous section . here",
    ", to be specific , some atoms lying in a bec - type state means that they can be described by a same single - particle wave function when computing the interference pattern they generate .      in this section , we discuss dependence of @xmath33 on the temperature @xmath18 .",
    "let us first discuss the time variation of @xmath40 in eq.([p - xi ] ) .",
    "it is mainly determined by competition of the following two aspects of the schrdinger evolution of @xmath41 on the right hand side of eq.([psi - ax ] ) .",
    "on one hand , expansion of the wave packet @xmath30 converts @xmath42 in eq.([rho - ax - p ] ) to @xmath43 with a larger dispersion @xmath44 . on the other hand ,",
    "the interaction between the central atom and other atoms may induce decoherence , changing @xmath45 to a superposition of @xmath46 with smaller dispersions @xmath47 and with almost orthogonal @xmath48 .",
    "this decoherence process converts @xmath42 to @xmath43 with smaller dispersion @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the probability @xmath40 at a time @xmath49 has two sources : the first is due to wave - packet expansion from @xmath50 with @xmath47 at some previous time @xmath51 , and the second is due to decoherence from @xmath52 with @xmath53 at some previous time @xmath54 .    in eq.([p - con ] ) , only those @xmath40 with @xmath55 contribute to @xmath33 . at temperatures",
    "@xmath18 obviously higher than ( still of the order of ) @xmath0 , @xmath17 is obviously larger than the mean value of @xmath19 .",
    "physically , one can assume that @xmath40 decreases sufficiently fast with increasing @xmath19 beyond @xmath56 .",
    "( later we show that this assumption leads to a self - consistent result . )",
    "then , for @xmath40 with @xmath55 , the above - discussed contribution from the second source is small , compared with that from the first one , and can be neglected .    then , for large @xmath19 , we get the following expression of @xmath40 , in terms of @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 , the second term on the right hand side represents the effect of decoherence which converts @xmath46 to superpositions of narrower wave packets of the central atom , and @xmath62 indicates the rate of this decoherence process .",
    "the two variables @xmath19 and @xmath25 are connected by the relation @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the expanding speed of the packet .",
    "the speed @xmath64 is determined by the width of the initial packet whose expansion gives contributions to both @xmath40 and @xmath57 , hence , @xmath64 is @xmath19-independent . since as discussed above the dispersion @xmath19 has a mean value given by @xmath10 in eq.([xi0 ] ) , in most cases @xmath64",
    "is approximately determined by @xmath10 , hence , it is temperature - dependent . according to standard textbooks",
    "[ see eq.([sp ] ) to be cited below ] , @xmath65 , as a result , @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , we write @xmath67 with @xmath68 approximately temperature - independent .    in an equilibrium state , the probability @xmath40 is time - independent , denoted by @xmath69 . for large @xmath19 , eq.([delta - p ] ) shows that this distribution satisfies @xmath70 where @xmath67 has been used .",
    "equation ( [ dp - dxi ] ) has a solution , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is an integration constant .",
    "we assume that the decoherence rate @xmath73 has the following dependence on @xmath19 and @xmath18 , @xmath74 with a parameter @xmath75 independent of @xmath19 and @xmath18 . to get the values of @xmath76 and @xmath77",
    ", we note that the decoherence is induced by collisions among the atoms .",
    "this implies that , approximately , @xmath78 should be proportional to the number of collisions per time unit .",
    "first , it should be proportional to the mean speed of the atoms , hence , @xmath79 , giving @xmath80 .",
    "second , since the collision number is approximately proportional to the cross sections of the gaussian packets , one has @xmath81 , giving @xmath82 . for @xmath80 and @xmath83 , eq.([p - xi - int ] ) gives @xmath84 equation ( [ p - xi-2 ] ) shows that our previous assumption about the fast decay of @xmath40 for large @xmath19 is self - consistent .    as to the parameter @xmath72",
    ", we note that due to the @xmath18-dependence of the decoherence rate @xmath73 with @xmath85 , the variation rate of @xmath69 in eq.([dp - dxi ] ) with respect to @xmath19 is in fact @xmath18-independent .",
    "this suggests that the parameter @xmath72 may be @xmath18-independent .",
    "below , we assume that @xmath72 is either @xmath18-independent or changes slowly with @xmath18 .",
    "now , we compute the proportion @xmath33 . substituting eq.([p - xi - int ] ) with eq.([eta - t ] ) into eq.([p - con ] ) , direct derivation shows that , in terms of @xmath86 , @xmath33 can be written as @xmath87 in the experiment we are to discuss , the mean atomic distance @xmath17 is proportional to @xmath88 , therefore , we write @xmath89 [ see eq.([da - app ] ) to be given later for an explicit expression of @xmath17 ] .",

    "even we change the value of @xmath208 as well , no obvious improvement has been observed .",

    "a hint to a possible origin of the above - discussed transition behavior of the contrast lies in an observation made in ref.@xcite .",

    "in this paper , we study the conjecture that , in a gas at a temperature above but not much above the bec transition temperature , there may exist a small proportion of the atoms lying in a bec - type state .",
    "we show that experimental support to this conjecture exists , that is , in a hybrid model based on this conjecture , some unexplained experimental results reported in ref.@xcite can be explained .",
    "what is left unexplained is a transition behavior of the contrast , from a relatively - low temperature region , in which the atoms behave like thermal atoms , to a relatively - high temperature region , in which some of the atoms show quantum coherence like that in some bec - type state . in order to understand this transition behavior , further investigations , both experimental and theoretical , are needed .",
    "a key point may lie in the role played by a velocity - selection feature of the bragg beams .    in the experimental aspect",
    ", it would be useful to study possible connection between the transition region discussed above and the velocity - selection effect of the bragg beams , for example , in the case of @xmath219 .",
    "in addition , study of the contrasts at temperatures higher than those reported in ref.@xcite should be of interest , too . in the theoretical aspect ,",
    "a key problem is whether there may exist any relation between the velocity - selection effect of the bragg beams and the formation of a bec - type state among some atoms . to solve this problem is a challenging task .",
    "in fact , the mechanism of the formation of bec is a topic that has not been fully understood , yet , though lots of efforts have been seen and important progresses have been achieved @xcite .",
