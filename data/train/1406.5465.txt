    "it is evident that the fluid particles are densely packed close to the wall at the wall - liquid interface due to hard - sphere effects . in particular , the transition between the wall - vapor interface and the wall - liquid interface seems to lead to a quasi step - like increase of the density .",

    "packing close to the wall becomes even more pronounced .",

    "let us now look at the results for the film heights @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "we can make two main observations .",
    "first , there seems to be a reasonable agreement between height profiles @xmath147 and @xmath156 in figs .",
    "[ fig:2014_1_7_17_31_disjoiningpressurex ] ( a ) , ( c ) and ( e ) . a more accurate means to compare the behavior of the height profiles is through their corresponding disjoining pressure profiles in figs .",
    "[ fig:2014_1_7_17_31_disjoiningpressurex ] ( b ) , ( d ) and ( f ) .",
    "note that the corresponding disjoining pressure plots correspond to the rescaled curvatures of the height profiles , in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ eq : filmheightanddisjoiningpressure ] ) .",
    "we observe that the maximal curvature of both height profiles @xmath147 and @xmath156 agree very well . also , the curvature of both height profiles @xmath147 and @xmath156 changes sign , which is more evident in fig .",
    "[ fig:2014_1_7_17_31_disjoiningpressurex ] ( f ) .",
    "in contrast , @xmath148 exhibits a lower curvature than @xmath147 and @xmath156 and it does not change its sign . furthermore , @xmath148 approaches an isodensity line for @xmath168 around @xmath169 , i.e.  much greater than @xmath170 .",
    "we note that the results for @xmath148 are similar to results obtained in ref .   for fluids with short - ranged interactions and using mc computations in that the height profile @xmath148 approaches isodensity lines @xmath171 for large @xmath24 .",
    "at the same time the results are surprising for two reasons .",
    "first , the height profile @xmath147 is defined through the disjoining pressure @xmath157 , which is based on computations of planar wall - fluid interfaces .",
    "hence , it loses some of the physics associated with the true 2d contact line region profiles in that it does not include any nonlocal effects in the direction parallel to the substrate , or effects due to the slope of the liquid - vapor interface .",
    "nevertheless , it does give a good prediction of the adsorption height profile @xmath156 for contact angles up to @xmath2 .",
    "second , the height profile @xmath148 , which is based on the disjoining pressure @xmath158 , seems to behave very differently in the vicinity of the contact line compared to the dft - fmt computations , even though it contains information from the full 2d density distribution .",
    "the computations of height profiles through a three - phase contact line bring us a considerable step closer to addressing one of the main questions posed in the discussion papers that appeared in  _ eur .",
    "j. : spec .",
    "_ , special issue ` wetting and spreading science - quo vadis ? ' ,  @xcite which is : considering the disjoining pressure based on the normal force balance @xmath146 , which is the correct choice of order parameter @xmath106 , if indeed there is one , that gives an accurate local function @xmath172 ? in this special issue , henderson  @xcite noted that the disjoining pressure is inherently non - local , and that there is no unique pair @xmath173 , in accordance with parry  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite in this context , macdowell  @xcite notes that the nonlocality of the disjoining pressure can only matter very close to the contact line , as far enough from the contact line young s equation must be satisfied .",
    "the computations presented in this study are a decisive first step towards addressing the question of universality of the disjoining pressures @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "in particular , we show that for the cases considered here , the disjoining pressure obtained from the adsorption isotherm seems to accurately predict the height profile even very close to the contact line .",
    "however , we also note that the disjoining pressure based on the adsorption isotherm apparently does not correspond to the excess pressure acting on the substrate obtained from a normal force balance .",
    "one way to test if there is a unique pair @xmath173 would be by comparing static nanodroplets with each of the two disjoining pressures and compare the results to those obtained from dft - fmt , but this is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "we have computed the density distribution in the vicinity of a three - phase contact line at equilibrium using a dft - fmt theory with a mean - field barker - henderson approach for long - range particle interactions for three different substrate strengths , corresponding to contact angles of @xmath174 , @xmath114 and @xmath175 .",
    "we have confirmed that the results satisfy basic sum rules to a good accuracy .",
    "the computations allow us to probe the fluid structure in the immediate vicinity of the contact line : fluid particles are closely packed close to the contact line due to hard - sphere effects .",
    "this packing leads to a quasi - stepwise increase of the density as the wall is approached . for smaller contact angles , i.e. as the attraction of the wall increases , the stepwise structure of the density is amplified .",
    "furthermore , we have employed numerical results of adsorption isotherms for different substrate strengths to define a disjoining pressure in the spirit of derjaguin - frumkin adsorption theory .",
    "we have also used the results from our equilibrium dft computations of the density profile to define a disjoining pressure based on the normal force balance at the contact line . via an effective mean - field",
    "hamiltonian approach , both disjoining pressures were employed to define height profiles to describe the three - phase contact line .",
    "these were compared with the height profile defined by the adsorption of the equilibrium density obtained from dft .",
    "the results of the comparison of the two disjoining pressures can be summarized as follows : the disjoining pressure based on the adsorption isotherm following the derjaguin - frumkin theory shows good agreement with the dft adsorption height profile in terms of maximal curvature and behavior for large film heights .",
    "in contrast , the height profile defined through the disjoining pressure based on a normal - force balance shows a very different behavior , in particular , its maximal curvature is lower than that obtained from dft and derjaguin - frumkin , and it shows a different behavior for large film heights compared to the other height profiles .",
    "our results hence show that the disjoining pressure definition which gives the better prediction for the adsorption film thickness is based on the adsorption isotherm and does not correspond to the excess pressure acting on the substrate , thus contradicting the classical notion of what the disjoining pressure stands for .",
    "one important restriction of the model used in this work is that it is of a mean - field type which does not take into consideration thermal fluctuations .",
    "@xcite while we do not expect this to alter the general results of this work , fluctuations can not be neglected generally .",
    "for example , fluctuations were observed when modeling a contact line using an mc algorithm for a fluid with short - range fluid - fluid interactions .",
    "@xcite we note that including fluctuations in the fluid description calls for an amended hamiltonian theory , in which the liquid - vapor interface has to be assumed to depend on the film thickness , such as suggested by macdowell  _ et  al . _ for long - range fluid - fluid interactions .",
    "@xcite however , incorporating fluctuations in a dft model is highly nontrivial  @xcite and beyond the scope of this work .    clearly , there are many future directions that can be explored . for instance , how chemically and/or topographically heterogeneous substrates , which are known to influence wetting characteristics substantially ,  @xcite affect the fluid structure in the vicinity of the contact line . of particular interest would also be the much more involved dynamic case . for this purpose , the dynamic dft approach developed recently for colloidal fluids  @xcite should serve as a basis for the accurate modeling of moving contact lines as it takes into account both microscale inertia and hydrodynamic interactions , two effects which strongly influence nonequilibrium properties .",
    "we shall address these and related issues in future studies .",
