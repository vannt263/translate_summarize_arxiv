    "the fundamental scattering mechanisms governing hot - electron spin transport in magnetic materials over a wide energy regime is a subject of intense research .",
    "@xcite experimental techniques or devices that employ hot - electron transport , generally comprise of a schottky barrier at a metal - semiconductor ( m / s ) interface and a ferromagnetic ( fm ) metal base into which hot electrons are injected .",
    "hot - electron transmission in the fm layer depends exponentially on its thickness and is influenced by the choice of the m / s interface , which acts both as an energy and momentum filter .",
    "the scattering processes during transmission depend on the energy - dependent inelastic mean - free path , elastic and quasielastic scattering processes , as well as on the group velocity of the states above the fermi level into which the hot electrons propagate .",
    "@xcite + from transport experiments with hot electrons , the energy dependent attenuation length in several fms such as co , nife , cofe etc . has been determined .",
    "@xcite the sensitivity of the hot - electron attenuation length to the momentum distribution of the injected electrons in co was also demonstrated .",
    "@xcite using identically prepared metal base , it was seen that the attenuation length in co was found to be a factor of 2 larger for hot electron injection across an amorphous al@xmath0o@xmath1 tunnel barrier as compared to an ideal vacuum tunnel barrier . +     schematic layout and energy band diagram of a beem experiment .",
    "a ptir tip is used to inject hot electrons over the vacuum barrier , in a au(nisi@xmath0)/ni / au base .",
    "the transmitted electrons are then collected in an n - si(111 ) semiconductor .",
    "au and nisi@xmath0 layers on n - si(111 ) give rise to two different sbhs @xmath2 or @xmath3 as depicted . ]    in spite of the aforementioned studies , our overall understanding of the processes governing hot - electron transmission and attenuation length in fm metals is still incomplete . in this work",
    "we investigate the energy dependence of the hot - electron attenuation length in ni and extricate the influence of different scattering processes on it by using two different schottky interfaces , namely , a polycrystalline si(111)/au and an epitaxial si(111)/nisi@xmath0 schottky interface .",
    "we employ ballistic electron emission microscopy ( beem ) for this purpose .",
    "identical si(111 ) surface preparation and deposition conditions for ni ensured a similar injection profile of the hot electrons injected into the metal layers .",
    "we find that the beem transmission is lower in ni across the polycrystalline si / au interface for all ni thicknesses studied .",
    "however , the hot - electron attenuation length in ni is measured to be the same for both the interfaces .",
    "our work highlights the dominant contribution of inelastic volume scattering to the hot - electron transmission in such ferromagnetic thin films .",
    "+ based on hot electrons , ballistic electron emission microscopy ( beem ) is an ideal technique to directly measure the attenuation lengths in thin metal films .",
    "beem , developed by bell and kaiser in 1988 @xcite , is the three terminal extension of a scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) where a tip ( emitter ) is used to inject non - equilibrium electrons ( energy few ev above the fermi level ) across a vacuum - tunneling barrier into a metallic overlayer ( base ) deposited on top of a schottky interface ( collector ) .",
    "depending on the scattering in the base , a fraction of the injected hot electrons propagates to the m / s interface and are collected as beem current @xmath4 when the necessary energy and momentum criteria to overcome the schottky barrier height ( sbh ) are satisfied ( fig .",
    "1 ) . from @xmath4 , measured in different regions , the local sbh can be determined using the bell - kaiser ( bk ) model . @xcite by fitting the decrease in @xmath4 with metal layer thickness , it is possible to extract the hot electron attenuation length in different materials .",
    "@xcite + in this work we investigated the hot - electron attenuation length in ferromagnetic ni films using two different sandwich structures of au / ni(t)/au and nisi@xmath0/ni(t)/au with ni thickness varying from 2 - 10 nm .",
    "the top au layer provides a chemically inert surface for _ ex situ _ sample transfer , and the bottom au and nisi@xmath0 layers on si(111 ) form the polycrystalline and epitaxial schottky interfaces , respectively .",
    "the choice of the two schottky interfaces was determined by the fact that au on si is the canonical polycrystalline schottky interface for hot electron studies , whereas the epitaxial schottky interface of nisi@xmath0 on si acts as a good energy and momentum filter for hot electrons , as established by our earlier work .",
    "@xcite @xmath4 was recorded at a fixed injection current , over a wide energy range and for each ni thickness , on both the schottky interfaces .",
    "the exponential decay of @xmath4 with varying ni thickness allowed us to extract the hot - electron attenuation length in ni at different energies .",
    "our device structures involved the preparation of atomically flat n - si(111 ) substrates onto which the metal layers were deposited using an ultrahigh - vacuum molecular beam epitaxy ( uhv mbe ) system .",
    "substrates consisted of buffered hydrofluoric acid ( hf)-etched n - si(111 ) with a lithographically defined area of 150 @xmath5 m diameter surrounded by a thick oxide insulator .",
    "the si surface was h - terminated using 1% hf followed by a second anisotropic etching step using 40@xmath6 ammonium fluoride ( nh@xmath7f ) solution .",
    "this anisotropic etching step resulted in well - terminated si(111 ) planes at the surface.@xcite the substrates were then immediately loaded into the mbe system at a base pressure of 10@xmath8 mbar .",
    "two different sets of samples were fabricated : for the first set , a thin epitaxial nisi@xmath0 was grown on an atomically flat si(111 ) substrate following the well - established method described elsewhere .",
    "@xcite further deposition of the ni thin films of varying thicknesses ( t ) and of the au cap layer ( 4 nm ) were performed at rt . for the second",

    "too , ni layers of varying thicknesses ( t ) were deposited , followed by a 4 nm au cap at rt .",

    "the hot - electron attenuation length can be written as the sum of inelastic [ @xmath25 and elastic ( @xmath26 ) scattering lengths as @xmath27 the collected current @xmath4 is a cumulative effect of the hot - electron transmission in au , ni and nisi@xmath0 layers , elastic scattering at the ni / au and ni / nisi@xmath0 interfaces , and the transmission probability at the si / au and si / nisi@xmath0 schottky interface .",

    "( 3 ) . assuming that the injected hot electrons are similarly attenuated in the top au and ni layers for both cases , we now analyze the other contributions to the observed difference in @xmath4 . in a recent study , the hot - electron attenuation length @xmath21 in nisi@xmath0 at v@xmath19 = -1.4 v @xcite , is determined to be 12 nm , similar to that in au.@xcite we have used a thinner nisi@xmath0 ( 4 nm ) film than au ( 8 nm ) at the schottky interface ; however , we find from a simple calculation that @xmath4 would still be larger at the epitaxial interface , even for an 8 nm nisi@xmath0 film , using the values of @xmath21 as stated above .",
    "we consider next the attenuation on both sides of the schottky interface for both si(111)/au / ni and si(111)/nisi@xmath0/ni .",
    "the good match of the electronic band structure at the ni / au interface is expected to result in minimal attenuation of the hot electrons at this interface.@xcite in the absence of band - structure calculation for nisi@xmath0 , we can not analyze the interface attenuation at the ni / nisi@xmath0 interface . however , the lattice mismatch between ni and nisi@xmath0 is larger than between au and ni , thus qualitatively suggesting that interface attenuation is larger in the former . in spite of the above interface attenuation in the base layers ( viz .",
    "au / ni / au and au / ni / nisi@xmath0 ) , the beem transmission for the entire device structure is found to be always larger for the epitaxial interface .",
    "this can be understood by the differences in the transmission probability across the schottky interface .",
    "the epitaxial si(111)/nisi@xmath0 schottky interface will have a higher transmission probability as compared to the polycrystalline si(111)/au schottky interface , where momentum mismatch of the transmitted hot electrons with that of the available states in si could lead to a large reduction in the beem transmission .",
    "@xcite + the similar values of the hot - electron attenuation length in ni for both interfaces , while @xmath4 is different , thus points to the fact that @xmath21 strongly depends on the electron - electron inelastic scattering in bulk ni and is less sensitive to elastic scattering or other momentum scattering events in the entire device structure .",
    "as described earlier in the text , the measurement temperature for both cases is not the same ( 300 k for the polycrystalline interface and 100 k for the epitaxial interface ) . to rule out the influence of temperature to the extracted @xmath21 values",
    ", we also performed beem transmissions for the polycrystalline interface at 100 k. although the electron - electron inelastic scattering is temperature independent @xcite , electron - phonon scattering is not . at 100 k ,",
    "no significant changes to the beem transmission was found , thus suggesting that the influence of acoustic - phonon scattering on the hot electron transmission is insignificant .",
    "our finding of almost similar @xmath21 in ni for different schottky interfaces is different from that in ref.@xcite where a factor of two difference in @xmath21 was found in co , for identical schottky interfaces but different injection interfaces .",
    "our experiments reveal interesting insights into hot - electron transport in ferromagnetic ni and the relative contribution of the different scattering processes to the extracted hot - electron attenuation length in ni . by changing the schottky interface at the collector while keeping the other layers and their thicknesses the same",
    ", we see that the overall beem transmission is reduced for the polycrystalline interface . the hot - electron attenuation length in ni , however , does not change significantly across both the interfaces for all the energies measured .",
    "this work underpins the dominant contribution of inelastic scattering to the hot - electron attenuation length in bulk ni for both the device structures .",
