    "generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite and their crossed version , i.e. , the generalized distribution amplitudes ( gdas ) @xcite appear in the perturbative description of certain hard exclusive processes , e.g. , in the leptoproduction of photon and mesons or in the production of hadron pairs in two photon annihilation . although the first systematic study of gpds and gdas was done for more than one decade @xcite , their physical significance has been widely realized in connection with the proton spin puzzle .",
    "namely , these distributions incorporate , besides other non - perturbative information that is not encoded in forward parton densities or form factors , also gravitational form factors from which the quark orbital angular momentum fraction contributing to the nucleon spin can be read off @xcite . this perception induced then intensive theoretical and experimental studies , in which it has been fully realized that gpds and gdas are a new concept to study the structure of hadrons and nuclei , contain a link between exclusive and inclusive processes and open a new window for the exploration of non - perturbative qcd . in the following a mini review about these developments",
    "is given , for comprehensive ones see refs.@xcite .    in sect .",
    "[ sec - feagenpardis ] the basic properties of gpds and their partonic interpretation are presented . in sect .",
    "[ sec - modlatcal ] gpd anstze are shortly discussed and is then devoted to the non - perturbative evaluation .",
    "the exclusive processes , which allow to gain access to these distributions , are listed in sect .",
    "[ sec - excrealo ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec - beylo ] results from the evaluation of radiative and power suppressed corrections beyond leading order ( lo ) are reported and finally , the conclusions are given .",
    "gpds are defined as fourier transform of light - ray operators , sandwiched between the initial and final hadronic states .",
    "there is a whole compendium of gpds : corresponding to the species of hadrons , the initial and final states can have different quantum numbers ( transition gpds ) , and even we might replace the hadrons by nuclei ( nucleus gpds ) . specified the initial and final states , gpds are classified with respect to the twist of the operators and the spin content of fields . at leading twist - two",
    "level three different types of quark and gluon gpds can be defined ( here the gauge link is omitted ) : @xmath0 with @xmath1 . in the first ( vector ) and second ( axial - vector ) entry the in- and outgoing partons have the same helicities , where its sum or difference of left- and right - handed partons is taken , respectively . for the third entry , called transversity , a helicity flip appears .",
    "gpds depend on the momentum fraction @xmath2 , conjugated to the light - cone distance @xmath3 , the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath4 in the @xmath5-channel , the momentum transfer @xmath6 , and the renormalization scale @xmath7 .",
    "the latter is induced by the renormalization prescription of the operators , which is part of the gpd definition . to deal with the polarization of the hadronic states",
    ", one might introduces a form factor decomposition @xcite .",
    "for instance , for the nucleon gpd dirac and pauli - like form factors appear in the vector case @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "definitions ( [ def - gpd - q])([def - forfacdec ] ) imply the basic properties :    * gpds reduce in the forward limit @xmath10 to parton densities @xcite , e.g. , @xmath11 while the helicity flip contribution @xmath12 decouples . *",
    "the @xmath7-dependence is governed by linear evolution equations @xcite , which can be derived from the renormalization group equation of the light - ray operators @xcite .",
    "* hermiticity together with time reversal invariance leads to a definite symmetry with respect to the skewness parameter @xmath13 , e.g. , @xmath14 * the mellin moments of gpds are expectation values of local twist - two operators : @xmath15 lorentz covariance induces that they are polynomials in @xmath13 , which are even in ( [ def - mellmom ] ) .    furthermore , gpds are constrained in the region @xmath16 by the positivity of the norm in the hilbert space of states .",
    "the most general form of such positivity bounds @xcite , known so far , are given as an infinite set of constraints @xcite . since gpds are implicitly scheme dependent , positivity bounds are a request on both the gpd model and scheme .",
    "note also that gpds can be represented as overlap of light - cone wave functions @xcite .",
    "let us give a partonic interpretation of gpds .",
    "a generic quark gpd , e.g. , in the vector case , @xmath17 is decomposed in its quark @xmath18 and anti - quark @xmath19 part . in the central ( exclusive or er - bl ) region",
    "@xmath20 , @xmath21 might be interpreted as probability amplitude to have a meson like configuration inside the hadron , while the outer ( inclusive or dglap ) region @xmath22 can be viewed as probability amplitude for emission and absorbing a quark with momentum fraction @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "lorentz invariance ties this both regions , which can be read off from the representation ) , where @xmath25 might be derived by means of a partonic fock state decomposition and the so - called @xmath26-representation for feynman diagrams . ] that ensures polynomiality ( valid for @xmath27 ) : @xmath28 obviously , in the central region the gpd is given by @xmath29 from which the outer region , determined by the antisymmetric function @xmath30 , can be restored , see fig .",
    "[ figparint ] .",
    "the uniqueness of this continuation procedure was shown in connection with the support extension of evolution kernels @xcite .",
    "gpds simultaneously possess a longitudinal and transversal momenta dependence and so they encode the three dimensional distribution of partons in the considered hadron or nucleus @xcite . indeed",
    ", a partonic density interpretation holds in the infinite momentum frame as long as @xmath31 @xcite , see also refs .  @xcite . in this kinematics the central region , i.e. , the parton number violating contributions , drops out .",
    "thus , it could be shown that in the impact parameter space within the infinite momentum frame @xmath32 has the probabilistic interpretation to find a parton species @xmath33 in dependence on the momentum fraction @xmath2 and the relative distance @xmath34 from the proton center .",
    "it is noted that an interpretation of the three dimensional fourier transform of gpds in the rest frame has been suggested within the concept of phase space ( wigner ) distributions @xcite .",
    "gpds are mostly unknown functions with a complex variable dependence , which must satisfy the basic properties .",
    "because of the lack of further knowledge , gpd anstze , needed for the estimation of cross sections and asymmetries , are constructed so far by simplicity and intuition @xcite .",
    "such an ansatz , given at the input scale @xmath35 , is based on the assumption of @xmath36 and @xmath37 factorization and is now widely used in phenomenology : @xmath38 here @xmath39 are partonic form factors , partially fixed by sum rules .",
    "the reduced gpd @xmath40 is given in terms of a factorized ansatz for the so - called double distribution @xmath41 with the parton density @xmath42 and an unknown profile function @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "this ansatz might be refined by a regge - like ansatz for the parton densities at small @xmath2 : @xmath44 @xcite . to repair an artifact in the relation among gpd and dd @xcite a so - called @xmath45-term",
    "is added in ( [ ansgpd ] ) , intuitively understood as meson exchange contribution in the @xmath5-channel @xcite .    in the region @xmath46 for small @xmath2",
    "it also has been proposed to equate the reduced gpds with the parton densities at the input scale and so skewness is purely generated by evolution @xcite .",
    "we note that in this region , where gluon and sea quark contributions are dominating , the parameterization of the hard - scattering amplitude convoluted with a gpd drastically simplifies . here , the skewness effect at the input scale effectively enters the normalization @xcite .",
    "a further proposal for the gpd parametrization is based on their representation as an infinite sum of @xmath5-channel exchange contributions @xcite .",
    "the gpd parameterizations , proposed so far , do not simultaneously satisfy the needs :    * basic properties must be automatically fulfilled .",
    "* flexible parametrization of the degrees of freedom that are left .",
    "* simple numerical treatment of evolution and convolutions .",
    "these requests can be mostly satisfied within a generalization of the mellin representation for parton densities by adopting the concept of complex angular momentum to the conformal spin expansion of gpds @xcite",
    ".    the poor knowledge about gpds might be improved by non - perturbative model calculations , done at a low @xmath7 scale .",
    "the resulting gpds can then be evolved to the scale that is relevant for their phenomenological use . however",
    ", the scheme dependence of gpds leads to uncertainties in this matching procedure , which should be considered as part of the model . because of limited space",
    ", all the efforts can not be reviewed here in detail , however , at least it should be mentioned a few of them , namely , calculations within the mit bag model @xcite , chiral quark soliton model @xcite , constituent quark model @xcite , and bethe - salpeter and light - cone wave function approaches @xcite .",
    "more recently , the first few mellin moments ( [ def - mellmom ] ) for proton gpds have been measured on the lattice @xcite . especially , the quark orbital angular momentum fraction of the proton spin , the second moment of a certain gpd combination , could be extracted .",
    "also the correlation of the @xmath37 dependence with the order @xmath47 of moments leads to a valuable insight in the nucleon gpds .",
    "the slope of the @xmath37 dependence decreases with increasing @xmath47 and so the transversal size of the proton shrinks with increasing @xmath2 , which has been argued in ref .",
    "@xcite . from this one concludes that the factorized ansatz ( [ ansgpd ] ) is oversimplified .",
    "it might be also possible to rich from lattice results a better understanding of the skewness dependence .",
    "so far the common gpd anstze leads always to an enhancement of the ( reduced ) gpds , compared to parton densities , at the crossing point @xmath48 . for the phenomenology",
    "it is highly desired to have a more rigorous understanding of this issue .",
    "( 80,20)(0,0 ) ( 10,-8 )    hadronic variables : + @xmath49 , + @xmath50 +   + scaling limit : + @xmath51  fix + @xmath52  fix    gpds appear in the perturbative description of the hard photon or meson leptoproduction : @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the final baryon state and @xmath55 stands for the photon or the observed meson .",
    "the virtuality @xmath56 of the intermediate photon must be sufficiently large .",
    "this implies that the hadronic scattering amplitude factorizes into a hard - scattering one convoluted with gpds and eventually a meson distribution amplitude ( da ) , see fig.[fig - harmesleppro ] @xcite .",
    "usually , one defines this factorization in such a way that the collinear divergencies are removed within a ( modified ) minimal subtraction scheme . obviously , this procedure is ambiguous and induces , e.g. , the factorization scale dependence .",
    "if the same factorization scheme is applied for all processes , gpds and das are universal in the sense that they are process independent , however , they depend on the scheme and of the order at which the perturbation theory is truncated . thus , gpds serve at the first place as a tool that _ connect _ physical observables measured in different processes . concerning their probabilistic interpretation",
    ", one must conclude that the number of measured partons depends on the scheme conventions ( even in untruncated perturbation theory ) .",
    "this problem , appearing also for parton densities , might be resolved by choosing a reference process , e.g. , the leptoproduction of photons , in which all radiative corrections ( order by order ) are absorbed in the gpd definitions .",
    "let us first consider the leptoproduction of a meson .",
    "so far the quantum numbers allow such a process and the virtual photon is longitudinally polarized , the process is for sufficient large @xmath57 perturbatively described as shown in fig.[fig - harmesleppro ] .",
    "the initial and final hadron state might have different quantum numbers and so it is applicable for several processes , namely , the production of neutral and charged vector @xcite and pseudo scalar @xcite mesons and or even for exotic states like the pentaquark @xcite or hybrid mesons @xcite . besides the cross section also the transversal target spin asymmetry is described within the perturbative framework , which might be justified at a lower scale @xmath57 as for the cross section itself @xcite . to lo the convolution of gpds and meson da",
    "are separated @xmath58   \\phi^{f\\bar{f}}_m(y,{{\\cal q}}^2)\\ , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 and @xmath60 refers to the ( transition ) gpd and meson da , respectively .",
    "@xmath61 are the partonic charge factors , corresponding to the flavor content of the observed meson .",
    "hence , the produced meson serves as a flavor filter and so a flavor decomposition for gpds can be reached , e.g. , by measuring the processes @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath64 scales with @xmath65 , which leads to a scaling law @xmath66 for the cross section .",
    "however , this canonical scaling is logarithmically modified by evolution effects , mainly arising from gpds .",
    "several of these processes have been measured or a planned in fixed target ( hermes , jlab , compass ) and collider ( h1 , zeus ) experiments , for a review see the contributions of f.  sabatie and l.  favart in this proceedings .",
    "i only like to give a short attention to the electroproduction of neutral ( longitudinally polarized ) vector mesons , measured in the small @xmath67 region up to rather large @xmath57 by the h1 and zeus collaborations . here",
    "the amplitude ( [ pre - pro ] ) drastically simplifies , since now it is dominated by gluon exchange , and thus such experiments are an ideal testing ground of the perturbative framework and the study of the gluonic gpd .",
    "let me remind that under the assumption of su(3 ) symmetric meson das the ratio of cross sections should be : @xmath68 , which is in fair agreement with experimental data ( plotted with respect to the scale @xmath69 ) .",
    "another class of hard exclusive processes , in which gpds are accessible , are those in which the struck parton is purely probed within the electromagnetic interaction via the absorbtion and emission of photons @xcite : photo leptoproduction @xcite , see fig.[cspro ] , lepton pair photoproduction @xcite and lepton pair leptoproduction @xcite . in the first two processes the photon virtuality is space- and time - like respectively , while in the third one both photons are virtual .",
    "the latter one is experimentally most challenging , however , it is the only one in which a deconvolution of the gpds is possible . in all these processes",
    "there are two interfering subprocesses , the hard virtual compton scattering and the bethe - heitler ( bh ) bremsstrahlungs process , given in terms of the electromagnetic form factors . for the case",
    "that at least one photon has a large virtuality , the compton scattering process factorizes , shown in fig .",
    "[ cspro ] to lo .",
    "hence , the cross section has a rich azimuthal angular dependence and the interference term is linear in the gpds .",
    "this offers the possibility to unreveal the gpds by measuring asymmetries that are dominated by the interference term : charge , single beam and target spin asymmetries , while double spin asymmetries require the subtraction of the bh contribution . in collider experiments",
    "it is even possible to extract the deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) cross section , since the bh amplitude is sufficiently small .",
    "a detailed compendium of asymmetries and their relations to gpds is given in ref .",
    "the first measurements of single beam spin and charge asymmetries and cross sections are compatible with the oversimplified gpd ansatz ( [ ansgpd ] ) .",
    "it was also argued that the amplitudes of the photon and meson photoproduction at large @xmath70 and @xmath71 factorize to lo in terms of the inverse gpd moments @xmath72 @xcite . for these processes",
    "also a perturbative treatment is used in which all valence partons are resolved via hard gluon exchanges @xcite . in this conjecture here",
    "only the struck parton is resolved while all spectators are contained in the gpd .",
    "this is somehow analogous to the mechanism proposed by feynman for the description of elastic form factors .",
    "unfortunately , no factorization theorem could be established , since power corrections are uncontrolled .",
    "this problem has been attempted to resolve by the assumption that the virtuality of the partons in the initial and final state is always small @xcite .",
    "note that the perturbative framework is also applicable for the photon @xcite and meson @xcite leptoproduction off nuclei .",
    "this opens a new window for the study of nucleus binding effects , especially , for the deuteron @xcite .",
    "to gain insight in the validity of the perturbative framework and to improve it , it is necessary to calculate higher order perturbative and power suppressed corrections or at least to estimate them .",
    "a large amount of work has been done in this direction during the last few years .",
    "the factorization theorems , derived to leading power accuracy , state that the perturbative corrections are systematically calculable in this approximation . the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections for the hard - scattering amplitude of both compton scattering processes @xcite and for leptoproduction of mesons have been completed @xcite .",
    "while for the former process the perturbative corrections , which depends on the gpd ansatz , turn out to be moderate , the size of nlo corrections for the latter is rather large .",
    "however , these corrections partly cancel in the transversal proton spin asymmetry @xcite .    employing conformal consistency predictions @xcite ,",
    "the evolution kernels have been evaluated to nlo @xcite and are implemented in numerical codes @xcite .",
    "note that conformal symmetry in the minimal subtraction scheme is broken in a subtle manner , which can be removed by a finite renormalization , providing the conformal subtraction ( cs ) scheme @xcite .",
    "in such a scheme the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) corrections to both the dvcs hard - scattering amplitude and evolution kernels can be borrowed from the known results in deep inelastic scattering , for a first discussion see ref .",
    "@xcite .    whether power suppressed contributions can be calculated within perturbative qcd depends on the process in question . for hard exclusive",
    "leptoproduction the exchange of a transversal polarized photon yields @xmath73 suppressed contributions . however , they are affected by non - integrable singularities , which appear to lo in @xmath74 and are induced by large size quark - antiquark configurations of the produced meson @xcite . in the case of photon leptoproduction",
    "@xmath65 suppressed contributions are calculable to lo @xcite and nlo @xcite accuracy .",
    "in fact , they complete the azimuthal angular dependence of the cross section @xcite .",
    "interesting to remark , that within an appropriate definition of observables they do not interfere with the twist - two prediction , appearing at leading power .",
    "twist - two predictions will be affected by @xmath75 power suppressed contributions appearing at twist - four level .",
    "such contributions have been perturbatively calculated to lo by neglecting multi - particle operators @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this approximation suffers from an ambiguity in the choice of the multi - particle operator basis , which shows up in the violation of current conservation .",
    "this problem is not resolved so far .",
    "upper bounds of the power corrections to the hard electroproduction have been estimated within the renormalon approach and found to be large @xcite .",
    "the fact that perturbative and non - perturbative corrections for leptoproduction of mesons are much larger as for photons indicates that the onset of the scaling region for the former process will be at a higher scale as for the latter one . for photon leptoproduction one would expect that , as in the case of deep inelastic scattering , a scale of few @xmath76 is sufficient to apply perturbative qcd",
    "in the last decade the concept of generalized parton distributions and distribution amplitudes has been enormously developed : a partonic interpretation has been given in depth , factorization theorems has been derived , predictions for numerous processes has been worked out , radiative corrections are calculated to nlo accuracy , including the evolution equations , first measurements on the lattice has been performed , and experimental accessibility has been demonstrated in pioneering experiments .",
    "gpds and also gdas can be explored within measurements of hard exclusive , however , inelastic processes in fixed target and collider experiments , where a deconvolution with respect to the momentum fraction is practically impossible .",
    "only the leptoproduction of a lepton pairs allows to scan the central region of gpds .",
    "these functions are hybrids that incorporate parton densities , form factors , and distribution amplitudes .",
    "thus , they form a link between exclusive and inclusive processes and encode information about non - perturbative qcd , which can not be obtained from inclusive or elastic exclusive processes .",
    "gpds / gdas are a new tool that allows to study the structure of hadrons and nuclei from a new perspective .",
    "so for instance , their knowledge would provide the quark orbital angular momentum contributing to the hadron spin and the three dimensional distribution of partons inside hadrons and nuclei .",
    "moreover , they can serve for the study of flavor and chiral symmetry breaking or nucleus binding effects , to name a few .",
    "as it has been stressed , gpds are scheme dependent quantities and , thus , their probabilistic interpretation should be done within an appropriate scheme convention .",
    "the solution of several open problems will require a large effort .",
    "the most challenging issue for the theory is whether factorization is applicable for the photon virtuality reached in present experiments . here",
    "higher order calculations beyond the nlo accuracy might give some insight .",
    "also the growing amount of experimental data will help to answer this question .",
    "a further issue concerns the appropriate and realistic parametrization of gpds . from the first photon leptoproduction measurements it becomes also clear that high precision data are needed to distinguish between gpd models .",
    "certainly , in the last decade a huge , however , first step has been taken in reaching a deeper understanding of the hadron and nuclei structure within the concept of gpds / gdas .",
