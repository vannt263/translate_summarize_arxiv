    "recently it has been proposed @xcite that the asymptotic behavior of the high overtone black hole quasinormal frequencies captures important information about the spectrum of black hole observables and about quantum gravity in general .",
    "more precisely , it has been suggested that the asymptotic real part of the black hole quasinormal frequencies coincides with the frequency emitted by a black hole whose area decreases by an amount that is natural from the point of view of discrete approaches to quantization of gravity such as loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) .",
    "while such approaches remain highly speculative , it is nevertheless interesting to understand how far this argument can be pushed ; moreover , even if this particular line of inquiry has to be abandoned , the asymptotic spectrum of black hole excitations is a fundamental property of the black hole which should eventually be good for something .",
    "this paper is an attempt to simplify and extend the calculations of the relevant `` experimental data . ''",
    "let us briefly review the recent developments in loop quantum gravity which have led us to investigate this asymptotic spectrum .",
    "( see @xcite for increasingly lengthy reviews of lqg and @xcite for the original derivations of the area quantization law in lqg . ) in lqg , the natural quantum @xmath4 of the horizon s area is proportional to the so - called barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath5 @xcite , a parameter in lqg which is arbitrary from the point of view of the microscopic definition of the theory , but whose value must be chosen in such a way that the black hole entropy comes out correctly .",
    "this comes about as follows : one imagines that each quantum of area @xmath4 carries a piece of discrete information .",
    "it can be found in @xmath6 different microstates , and therefore it carries entropy @xmath7 .",
    "this must be equal to the known contribution of this area quantum to the black hole entropy , namely . ] @xmath8 , so we find that lqg predicts that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the minimal allowed spin carried by the spin networks .",
    "this means that @xmath11 if the basic gauge group of lqg is taken to be @xmath12 , or @xmath13 if the gauge group is @xmath14 .",
    "however , from the lqg point of view there seems to be no reason to choose this strange number @xmath15 or @xmath16 ( more precisely , @xmath17 or @xmath18 ) for the barbero - immirzi parameter .    on the other hand ,",
    "seemingly unrelated , one can consider the `` quasinormal modes '' of the black hole background .",
    "quasinormal modes are perturbations of the background which are allowed to have complex frequency but whose boundary conditions must be `` purely outgoing '' both at the horizon _ and _ at infinity ; we will review their precise definition in section [ formu ] .",
    "this boundary condition singles out discrete complex frequencies @xmath19 . as @xmath20 ,",
    "the quasinormal frequencies of gravitational perturbations are known to behave as ( varying from the usual convention in general relativity , we parameterize the frequencies in terms of @xmath21 , which is equal to @xmath22 for a four - dimensional schwarzschild black hole . )",
    "the imaginary part of is not hard to understand .",
    "the quasinormal modes determine the position of poles of a green s function on the given background , and the euclidean black hole solution converges to a thermal circle at infinity with the inverse temperature @xmath23 ; therefore it is not too surprising that the spacing of the poles in coincides with the spacing @xmath24 expected for a thermal green s function .",
    "however , we are not aware of a similar classical explanation of the term @xmath16 in .",
    "this term is remarkable because , as was first observed in @xcite , it is precisely the same strange number one needs to occur in the barbero - immirzi parameter of lqg if the gauge group is taken to be so(3 ) .",
    "there are also some heuristic arguments which suggest that there might indeed be a reason to relate the two , identifying the quasinormal mode with a process in which the black hole ejects a single spin - network edge and thus reduces its area by @xmath4 .",
    "the result was originally obtained by numerical calculations ten years ago @xcite . at that time",
    "the term @xmath16 was only known to an accuracy of six decimal places . in 1998 ,",
    "hod conjectured @xcite that this number was exactly @xmath16 .",
    "his conjecture was recently proven in @xcite , using the methods of continued fractions initiated by leaver @xcite and further refined by nollert @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we would like to reproduce the results of @xcite , using simpler functional methods which also allow us to extend the analysis to the cases of charged and higher - dimensional black holes .",
    "we will find that the answer @xmath25 is in fact universal for schwarzschild black holes in all dimensions , at least for scalar and some gravitational perturbations . for reissner - nordstrm in @xmath3 we will find a more complicated generically aperiodic behavior , both for scalar and electromagnetic - gravitational perturbations .",
    "our computation depends on an analytic continuation in the radial coordinate @xmath26 , so it is worth mentioning that analytic continuation in @xmath26 has been applied to the determination of quasinormal modes many times before ; in particular , it was the basis of the numerical calculations in @xcite which confirmed that @xmath27 for schwarzschild",
    ". a review of the use of complex coordinate methods to compute black hole quasinormal frequencies has recently appeared in @xcite , to which we refer the reader for more extensive references .",
    "we note that in our calculation of the leading - order asymptotic frequencies no phase integral technology will be required ; it will be enough to use simply the first - order wkb approximation .",
    "we believe that this puzzling behavior of the green s functions at large imaginary frequencies should contain some important information about black holes and perhaps even quantum gravity .",
    "in this section we will be concerned with properties of certain perturbations of a four - dimensional schwarzschild geometry , described by solutions of the differential equation @xcite @xmath28 ^ 2 + v(r ) -   \\omega^2 \\right ) \\psi(r ) = 0\\ ] ] on the interval @xmath29 , with the `` regge - wheeler '' potential @xmath30 the equation describes the radial dependence of a spin-@xmath31 perturbation of the background , with orbital angular momentum @xmath32 and time dependence @xmath33 .",
    "we have set @xmath34 ; in these units the horizon is at @xmath35 .",
    "the numerator @xmath36 which appears in characterizes the spin @xmath31 of the perturbation for @xmath37 , i.e. for perturbations by scalar or electromagnetic test fields as well as perturbations of the metric itself .",
    "( actually , in the cases @xmath38 , one has to expand in tensor spherical harmonics and then is only correct if we consider an `` axial '' perturbation ; see e.g. @xcite . ) it is nevertheless interesting to study the problem for general @xmath31 , because our calculation relates this coefficient to bessel s equation and shows that it is very natural to write the numerator in this form",
    ". it might be useful to summarize its values for the most important examples of @xmath31 :    the factor @xmath39 which occurs in , is the `` warp factor '' in the schwarzschild geometry , which in schwarzschild coordinates is simply the time component @xmath40 of the metric .",
    "we wish to study on the physical region @xmath29 and we begin by describing the asymptotic solutions . to simplify the differential operator which appears it is convenient to define",
    "the `` tortoise coordinate '' @xmath41 with the property that @xmath42 integrating gives @xmath43 then @xmath41 takes values @xmath44 , and becomes @xmath45 - \\omega^2 \\right ) \\psi = 0.\\ ] ] since @xmath46 \\to 0 $ ] as @xmath47 , the solutions behave as @xmath48 at infinity .",
    "in our analysis we will find that it is essential to extend beyond the usual physical region @xmath29",
    ". continued to the whole complex @xmath26-plane , is an ordinary differential equation with regular singular points at @xmath49 , @xmath35 and an irregular singular point at @xmath50 ; and by the general theory of differential equations , any solution of in the physical region extends to a solution on the @xmath26-plane .",
    "however , this solution may be multivalued around the singular points @xmath49 , @xmath35 .",
    "this multivaluedness will play a crucial role in our analysis , which is essentially concerned with the computation of the monodromy around a particular closed contour in the @xmath26-plane . for convenience , to avoid having to deal with multivalued functions , we can put branch cuts in the @xmath26-plane from @xmath49 and @xmath35 and require that @xmath51 satisfy everywhere except at the cuts . in this approach",
    "the monodromy is defined by the discontinuity across the cut .",
    "the @xmath26-plane , with regions where @xmath52 denoted by a darker color , and a convenient choice of branch cuts shown .",
    "we will find it very convenient to exploit the simpler representation for the differential equation .",
    "after passing to complex @xmath26 this introduces an extra complication , since the relation between @xmath41 and @xmath26 is itself multivalued because of the term @xmath53 . as a result , as we travel around a contour in the @xmath26-plane , the corresponding contour in the @xmath41-plane may not be closed . in the language of branch cuts",
    "we would say that @xmath41 jumps when @xmath26 crosses the branch cut which emanates from @xmath35 .",
    "although @xmath41 is not uniquely defined as a function of @xmath26 , the ambiguity is only in the imaginary part , so @xmath54 still makes sense",
    ". it will be important for us to know the sign of @xmath54 in the various regions of the @xmath26-plane ; the structure is as shown in figure 1 .",
    "we also show a convenient choice of branch cuts ( to economize , one should take the branch cut to be the same for @xmath51 and for @xmath55 ) although nothing we say will depend on this choice .      because the potential @xmath56 is positive and decays to zero at both ends",
    ", there are no discrete normalizable bound states .",
    "nevertheless we may look for discrete _ quasinormal _ states , counterparts of quasistationary states in quantum mechanics because their frequency is also allowed to be complex .",
    "the mathematical theory of these quasinormal modes is more intricate than for ordinary normal modes ; see e.g. @xcite for a more precise discussion than we will give here , as well as an excellent review of the substantial literature on quasinormal modes of black holes .",
    "roughly , a quasinormal mode with frequency @xmath57 is supposed to be a solution of where we require `` outgoing '' behavior at both ends of the physical region : @xmath58 since the differential operator in would be self - adjoint acting on normalizable wavefunctions , and hence would have to have real eigenvalues , there are no quasinormal modes with @xmath59 .",
    "so we take @xmath60 , and then in , we are asking for the exponentially decreasing component to be absent at both ends .",
    "it is actually quite delicate to define exactly what this means !",
    "if @xmath46 $ ] were strictly vanishing at @xmath47 then one could just require that @xmath61 be strictly proportional to @xmath62 as appropriate , but for more general @xmath46 $ ] we do not know any way of defining the boundary condition using only the behavior of @xmath61 on the real line .",
    "this problem was also discussed in @xcite where it was suggested that the appropriate condition would be obtained by finding an analytic extension of @xmath61 to @xmath63 and demanding exponential _ decrease _ there ; this was further shown to be equivalent to looking for poles in an appropriate green s function . in @xcite",
    "another criterion was given in terms of the coefficients of a power series representation for @xmath61 ; this criterion is what was used in the analytical calculation of the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies in @xcite .",
    "here we wish to use another way of defining the boundary condition , by analytic continuation in @xmath26 instead of @xmath57 .",
    "( the method we describe below has been studied before , e.g. in @xcite ; see also @xcite for a recent discussion and additional references . ) by considering complex @xmath26 we can easily define the boundary condition at the regular singular point @xmath35 , because the functions @xmath62 are distinguished by their monodromy there .",
    "namely , @xmath64 , so to get @xmath65 near @xmath35 we simply require that @xmath51 have monodromy @xmath66 on a counterclockwise circle around @xmath35 .",
    "what is more subtle is to define the boundary condition at @xmath50 , but this can be done by analytically continuing @xmath51 via `` wick rotation '' to the line @xmath67 , where the asymptotic behavior of the solutions is purely oscillatory and hence one can really pick out a particular solution by specifying its asymptotics . in the limit where @xmath57 is almost pure imaginary , the line @xmath67 is slightly tilted off the line @xmath68 .",
    "there are two possible directions for the wick rotation and we choose the rotation through an angle smaller than @xmath69 . for the time being we assume @xmath70 ; in this case @xmath71 gets rotated to @xmath72 , so our boundary condition `` at @xmath73 '' is actually @xmath74      having defined the quasinormal modes we now proceed to study their frequencies , in the limit @xmath75 . indeed , until the end of this computation we will behave as if @xmath57 were purely imaginary .",
    "we will compute in two different ways the monodromy of @xmath51 around the contour shown in figure 2 , beginning and ending at the point marked a.    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _   contour for the calculation of quasinormal frequencies , shown in terms of @xmath26 and in terms of @xmath76 .",

    "clockwise just multiplies @xmath51 by @xmath113 , but it multiplies @xmath104 by @xmath114 , so the coefficient of @xmath104 in the asymptotics of @xmath51 must be multiplied by @xmath115 after the full round trip .",
    "comparing with gives @xmath116    note that if we had chosen @xmath117 we would have had to wick rotate in the opposite direction , hence set our boundary conditions at b instead of a , and run the contour in the opposite direction ; hence we would have gotten with @xmath118 instead of @xmath115 .",
    "this is as expected since if @xmath57 is a quasinormal frequency then @xmath119 must also be one ; the corresponding wave functions are simply complex conjugates of one another .",
    "the two possibilities can be summarized by the equation implying @xmath120 in the case @xmath121 we recover the numerical result of @xcite which was so important for @xcite : @xmath122 if our analysis of the dependence on @xmath123 is correct , it implies @xmath124 .",
    "hence for @xmath125 , there can not be any asymptotic quasinormal modes , with the possible exception of the case @xmath126 .",
    "( this case is exceptional in our analysis for another reason as well : if @xmath127 , then our form for the leading singularity vanishes .",
    "a more careful analysis would be desirable to check whether our results still hold in this case . )",
    "we should mention that is equivalent to a more complicated equation derived in @xcite , namely this equivalence can be shown by multiplying by and expressing the sines and cosines in terms of exponentials .",
    "for later convenience we now describe the preceding computation in a more compact notation .",
    "first write @xmath128 and @xmath129    then the asymptotic matching through the bessel region which we did by comparing and shows that a 3@xmath130 clockwise rotation in @xmath83 transforms the asymptotic behavior by @xmath131 where the swap between @xmath132 and @xmath133 arises because of the swap @xmath134 needed to compare and .",
    "in the case of four - dimensional schwarzschild we read off the initial asymptotics from as @xmath135 . since the coefficient of @xmath136 had to vanish at a we got the constraint @xmath137 the @xmath138 rotation gave @xmath139 so following the coefficient of @xmath140 back around the semicircle gives its monodromy as @xmath141 , which we computed using the constraint , obtaining @xmath142",
    "having reproduced the result of @xcite for @xmath3 schwarzschild , we now apply the same technology to two other classes of black hole .",
    "the generalizations are surprisingly straightforward .",

    "now we want to describe the tortoise coordinate in @xmath145 spacetime dimensions . from the warp factor",
    "we get the requirement which can be integrated to give where we chose the additive constant so that @xmath151 for @xmath49 . from",
    "we obtain the behavior of @xmath150 as shown in figure 3 .",
    "unlike the situation in @xmath3 , includes phases multiplying the logarithms which come from the fictitious `` horizons '' @xmath152 , so that @xmath150 is not well defined for arbitrary @xmath26 ; but so long as we stay in the right part of the @xmath26-plane it is well defined .    near @xmath49 ,",
    "@xmath153 terms in the taylor expansion of near @xmath49 cancel and generalizing the behavior in the @xmath3 case .",
    "actually , this cancellation can be seen directly from , by neglecting the term @xmath154 on the right hand side .",
    "now we can express the singularity of the potential in terms of @xmath83 ; combining and we find simply @xmath155 \\sim -\\frac{1}{4z^2}\\ ] ] note that this is exactly the same as the behavior for scalar perturbations in @xmath3 ; namely , it agrees with at @xmath156 . the other case for which we know the potential is a particular family of tensor metric perturbations studied in @xcite , which exist only in @xmath144",
    "; for these the leading singularity corresponds again to @xmath156 .",
    "( one might have expected @xmath157 , but in our final result @xmath31 appears only in @xmath158 , so that @xmath156 and @xmath157 are indistinguishable . ) we conjecture that with some suitable interpretation this form for the potential will actually persist for all @xmath31 , so that the @xmath159 may be replaced by @xmath160 in , but the skeptical reader may just set @xmath156 in the rest of this section .    at any rate ,",
    "writing the potential in this form the bessel function behavior of the solutions near @xmath49 , expressed in terms of @xmath83 , is just as it was in @xmath3 , and again we have plane wave behavior away from a neighborhood of @xmath49 . furthermore , although the left part of the @xmath26-plane is rather complicated , the behavior of @xmath54 on the right part is essentially unchanged from @xmath3 .",
    "so we can repeat the argument from the previous section .",
    "the calculation of the monodromy by matching asymptotics in the @xmath83-plane works exactly as in four dimensions , while the factor @xmath115 from the monodromy around @xmath35 is modified to @xmath161 , because of the coefficient @xmath162 multiplying @xmath163 in .",
    "fortunately , this same factor appears in the formula for the hawking temperature of a @xmath145-dimensional black hole .",
    "namely , recall that the hawking temperature can be computed as the surface gravity of the black hole : giving @xmath164 .",
    "hence the monodromy of the coefficient of @xmath140 around the contour is @xmath165 , and comparing this to the result from bessel asymptotics gives @xmath166 as desired .",
    "in fact the agreement between the surface gravity and the coefficient of the logarithm in the tortoise coordinate is not a coincidence and holds more generally .",
    "this is because a horizon is characterized by the condition @xmath167 , and the tortoise coordinate near @xmath168 then obeys @xmath169 while the surface gravity is @xmath170 .",
    "our result implies that for scalar and some gravitational perturbations @xmath171 in the revised version of @xcite , considerations of bohr - sommerfeld quantization ( as originally proposed by bekenstein and amplified e.g. in @xcite ) led to the conjecture that @xmath172 for some @xmath6 ; our calculation establishes this conjecture and furthermore determines the integer @xmath13 .",
    "finally we want to extend our results to non - extremal reissner - nordstrm black holes in @xmath3 . in this case",
    "the warp factor is @xmath173 where we have fixed our units by setting @xmath174 , @xmath175 , so that the outer horizon is at @xmath35 and the inner horizon is at @xmath176 .",
    "the tortoise coordinate is therefore determined by @xmath177 which integrates to @xmath178 where we have again fixed the constant so that @xmath78 at @xmath77 .",
    "then near @xmath179 we find @xmath180 the form of the potential can be found in @xcite : both for scalar perturbations and for axial electromagnetic - gravitational perturbations ( which are coupled in this background , so we can not talk about electromagnetic or gravitational perturbations separately ) the potential is singular only near @xmath77 , and the leading singularity is @xmath181 using we can rewrite this in the familiar form @xmath182",

    "however , in this case we must use a slightly more complicated contour , going around a `` lobe '' as shown in figure  4 ; the point is that we want to capture only the outer horizon at @xmath35 , where we know the boundary conditions and hence know the monodromy , and avoid the inner horizon at @xmath185 . as a result this computation is only valid in the non - extremal case @xmath186 .",
    "the corresponding picture in the @xmath83-plane looks rather complicated because a given @xmath83 may or may not lie in a `` bessel region '' depending on whether or not the @xmath26-plane contour is passing near @xmath49 ( the potential is a multivalued function of @xmath83 but an ordinary function of @xmath26 . ) in figure  4 this is indicated by letting the contour pass over or under the blue circles when @xmath83 is _ not _ passing through a bessel region ; it is easiest to understand that figure by redrawing it yourself , following the given @xmath26-plane contour starting at a and tracing out the corresponding @xmath83-plane behavior .",
    "the matching of asymptotic expansions in this case can be done following the recipe given in section [ notation ] .",
    "as before , we begin at the point marked a with the asymptotic behavior @xmath135 , and we have the boundary condition @xmath187 going through a @xmath188 rotation in @xmath83 gives ( compare ) @xmath189 which is in this case @xmath190 .",
    "then we can go out along the lobe where in our approximation the behavior is purely oscillatory .",
    "after going around the lobe we have to return to the bessel region a second time . however , the asymptotics in terms of @xmath83 will be different this time : we chose the branch of @xmath83 so that the first time we entered the bessel region it was at @xmath151 , but now we have traveled an additional distance in @xmath83 ( from changing branches of the second logarithm in ) , namely @xmath191 so we may write the solution as @xmath192 introducing a slight modification of our previous notation , we write @xmath193 then from we obtain @xmath194 , giving the constraint @xmath195 making the second @xmath188 rotation we get @xmath196 , so the asymptotics near the point b are @xmath197 . now running over the big semicircle to get back to the point a , as before",
    ", the wkb approximation allows us to claim the coefficient of the exponentially big component @xmath104 is unchanged .",
    "so over the full round trip this component is multiplied by @xmath198 . between",
    "and we have three homogeneous linear constraints on the four coefficients @xmath199 , so we can determine this ratio ; it turns out to be @xmath200 the contour encloses only the singularity at @xmath35 ( the outer horizon ) , so the monodromy comes only from the multivaluedness of @xmath61 and @xmath104 around @xmath35 . as discussed in the previous section , this monodromy",
    "is determined by the surface gravity of the horizon at @xmath35 , namely @xmath201 also note that @xmath202 . then matching the monodromies we obtain the final result",
    ", @xmath203 the first term looks exactly like the result from schwarzschild , and then there is a correction term which came from the phase shift @xmath204 .",
    "actually , this term can also be written in terms of a hawking temperature , but this time the hawking temperature of the inner horizon : @xmath205 at any rate , substituting @xmath206 or @xmath207 , from , gives the same answer in each case : @xmath208 so this is our result for the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies of scalar or axial electromagnetic - gravitational perturbations of reissner - nordstrm in @xmath3 .",
    "this result suggests a somewhat more complicated asymptotic behavior for the quasinormal frequencies than we found in the case of schwarzschild ; in particular , the asymptotic frequencies seem to be aperiodic unless @xmath209 is rational , and the real parts do not settle down to a simple value .",
    "we note that by taking @xmath6 slightly imaginary it would be possible to get rid of the last term in the asymptotic limit , and in this case one would obtain asymptotically @xmath210 .",
    "this may not be an unreasonable thing to do , since @xmath6 is related to the charge and mass of the black hole , and the mass should be considered as slightly imaginary ( the black hole eventually evaporates . ) indeed , if @xmath211 is real and fixed , then @xmath212 is a decreasing function of @xmath6 , so the expected small negative imaginary part of @xmath212 corresponds to a small positive imaginary part of @xmath6 , which is the correct sign to suppress the last term . following @xcite and identifying this @xmath213 with a quantum of energy emitted by a black hole",
    ", we note that this corresponds precisely to the black hole reducing its outer horizon area by @xmath214 while keeping @xmath211 fixed .",
    "one might be concerned that our result for reissner - nordstrm is incompatible with the known results for schwarzschild because it does not reduce to @xmath25 as @xmath215 .",
    "there is no inconsistency ; rather , there is an order - of - limits issue .",
    "for extremely small @xmath6 , @xmath216 will be approximately @xmath25 for a large range of @xmath217 but then eventually switch over to the reissner - nordstrm behavior determined by ; the value of @xmath217 at which the crossover occurs goes to @xmath218 as @xmath215 .",
    "we can make a rough estimate of the critical value @xmath219 above which the reissner - nordstrm description becomes more appropriate than the schwarzschild description ; namely , it is the point where the leading term @xmath220 is of the same order as the term @xmath221 which would be leading for the schwarzschild black hole . to compare these two terms",
    "the relevant @xmath26 is the place where we patch the plane wave with the bessel function solution , namely @xmath222 . to relate @xmath83 to @xmath26",
    "we can use either the relation @xmath223 from schwarzschild or @xmath224 from reissner - nordstrm . with either choice , requiring @xmath225 , i.e. @xmath226",
    ", we obtain finally @xmath227 i.e. @xmath228 if @xmath229 , the asymptotic reissner - nordstrm formula is appropriate ; if @xmath230 the schwarzschild result is appropriate .",
    "after the preprint version of this paper appeared , the formula as well as the order - of - limits issue discussed above were confirmed explicitly in the numerical analysis of @xcite ( see also @xcite for some discussion . )",
    "this work suggests various possible directions for further study :    * the machinery developed here may be applicable more generally , e.g. to charged black holes in @xmath144 , and perhaps even to general rotating black holes .",
    "some work in this direction is in progress for the kerr black hole in @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in addition one could consider the case of black holes in de sitter or anti - de sitter space ; quasinormal frequencies in these backgrounds have recently been studied @xcite , and recently some exact results have been obtained in the limit where the schwarzschild horizon nearly coincides with the de sitter horizon @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies in these backgrounds are related to properties of the holographic dual theory @xcite .",
    "the method will however require some modification , since the potential no longer vanishes at infinity , and the expected answer is quite different ( the real part is expected to diverge along with the imaginary part @xcite . ) * our results so far only give the asymptotic real part of the frequency in the limit of infinite imaginary part .",
    "it may be possible to extend the technique to obtain a systematic expansion including corrections in @xmath231 .",
    "after the preprint version of this paper appeared , the @xmath31 and @xmath32 dependence of the first correction for arbitrary @xmath31 appeared in @xcite , and the exact correction for @xmath157 including numerical coefficient was computed in @xcite .",
    "* it would be desirable to have some numerical calculations of the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies in the cases we considered above , to confirm or reject our proposed analytic solution . in the case of reissner - nordstrm , after the preprint version of this paper appeared , such calculations were indeed done @xcite and confirmed our solution in detail ( the agreement is also discussed in @xcite . )",
    "however , the case of higher - dimensional black holes remains numerically unstudied as far as we know .",
    "* in @xmath144 schwarzschild we could only give results for certain types of perturbation , because so far a good theory of more general perturbations in these dimensions is apparently lacking .",
    "it would be nice to understand how the leading term in the potential depends on the type of perturbation .",
    "* according to our calculation , the asymptotic real part of the frequency depends only on the coefficient of the leading term in the potential .",
    "this leading term becomes important only near the singularity at @xmath49 , but it still affects the transmission amplitude in the physical region between the horizon and infinity . although the importance of the singularity at @xmath49 was purely mathematical in our approach , there could be a more physical explanation of why our procedure works .",
    "can we view it as a manifestation of the complementarity principle , reflecting some kind of duality between what happens inside and outside the horizon ? *",
    "the occurrence of the hawking temperature for the inner horizon of the reissner - nordstrm black hole is surprising . how can the quasinormal modes know about the behavior of the black hole in the causally disconnected interior ? * the original motivation for this work was the lqg explanation @xcite of the @xmath16 in @xmath3 schwarzschild in terms of a spin network with links of spin 1 . if lqg is correct , perhaps the more complicated behavior for reissner - nordstrm should have a similar explanation .",
    "the possible appearance of @xmath15 in the asymptotic frequencies could support some recent claims @xcite that the gauge group of lqg should be su(2 ) despite the @xmath16 for schwarzschild . * similarly , can spin foam models or other models explain the fact that the @xmath16 for schwarzschild black holes seems to be independent of dimension ?    we have answered some questions about the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies of black holes , but many more remain open .",
