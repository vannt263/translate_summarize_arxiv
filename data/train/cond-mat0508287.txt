    "defects in crystals influence the physical properties of almost all materials significantly . in the last decades",
    ", defect engineering has been developed as a part of modern semiconductor technology .",
    "there is also an increasing interest in studying defects and their related strain fields in ferroelectrics , in particular in low dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "the influence of defects on the phase transition is one of key - like topics in the context of recent studies of ferroelectrics .",
    "the permanent attention attracted to ferroelectric ( fe ) material , is related to its role played in real ferroelectrics concerning fundamental problems as well as the broad variety of applications based on thin fe films , especially due to their suitability for application in nonvolatile fe random access memories @xcite .",
    "it is well known that localized spin excitations can arise in fe and magnetic systems with broken spatial translational symmetry , i.e. due to the presence of boundary surfaces , interfaces , impurities and other defects in the crystal .",
    "these localized modes appearing in the above mentioned structures are experimentally observed using the neutron and raman scattering @xcite or , more recently , far infrared absorption @xcite . from more theoretical point of view",
    "the green s function theory has been extensively employed to describe these modes in semi - infinite transverse ising models @xcite and fe thin films @xcite .",
    "in addition to bulk spin waves there may occur localized modes associated with the impurity layer @xcite and with the surface @xcite .",
    "more phenomenologically the influence of molecular impurity ions on fe phase transitions is studied by vikhin and maksimova using the landau theory @xcite .",
    "the relaxation ( damping ) of polarization motion is a result of microscopic fluctuations of the spins by means a coupling to other degrees of freedom such as phonons , impurities , defects etc .",
    "the mechanism behind can be originated by different reasons . once there could be realized a direct coupling of the elementary spin wave excitations to a thermal bath or to phonons manifested by a spin - phonon scattering .",
    "otherwise more complicated microscopic processes , such as `` slow relaxing '' impurities could control the fluctuations and the relaxation processes of the system . in that case",
    "the impurity modes are damped which leads to a relaxation of the polarization motion due to a direct coupling . in the present paper",
    "we want to study such a mechanism in detail based on an ising model in a transverse field .",
    "there are two kind of relaxation processes : inherent ( pure bulk material ) and non - inherent ( due to defects , impurities , surface , finite size ) .",
    "each microscopic relaxation mechanism predicts its own temperature and frequency dependencies .",
    "the damping can also depend on defect / impurity concentration and the sample size . using x - ray diffraction",
    "it is shown that too many structural defects can produce an excessive line broadening @xcite , e.g. defects contribute to the line width and consequently the damping increases .",
    "doping of thin films with different ions yields to variable increase of the damping @xcite .",
    "ingvarsson et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the relaxation mechanism in thin films could be realized in analogy to the bulk relaxation , where the phonon scattering process in the bulk should be replaced by surface and defect scattering in thin films .    a first attempt to find out the influence of defects on the polarization of fe thin films are elucidated by alpay et al",

    "the aim of the present paper is to study the damping effects and the relaxation times in fe thin films with different structural defect layers . to that purpose a previous paper @xcite",
    "is extended and modified in order to obtain the temperature dependence of the soft modes and their damping within fe thin films .",
    "it was obtained that with increasing film thickness the frequency increases likewise and the damping is larger for thin films than that for the bulk material .",
    "this is in agreement with different experimental observations @xcite . using raman",
    "spectroscopy the temperature dependence of the phonon modes for thin fe films of pbtio@xmath0 is discussed by taguchi et al .",
    "@xcite and fu et al .",
    "it was shown that in comparison with the single crystal spectra , the raman frequencies for the thin film are shifted remarkably to low frequencies and that the raman lines are broadened .",
    "similar results were obtained for pbtio@xmath0 fine particles by ishikawa et al .",
    "let us consider a three dimensional ferroelectric system on a simple cubic lattice composed of @xmath1 layers in z - direction .",
    "the layers are numbered by @xmath2 , where the layers @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent the two surfaces of the system .",
    "the bulk is established by the remaining @xmath5 layers .",
    "the specific surface effects are included by additional coupling parameters between bulk and surface layers . in particular , we start with the hamiltonian of the ising model in a transverse field which includes both , bulk and surface properties : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are components of spin-@xmath9 operators , @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent transverse fields in the bulk and surface layers , and the sums are over the internal and surface lattice points , respectively .",
    "@xmath12 is an exchange interaction between spins at nearest - neighbor sites @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and @xmath15 between spins on the surface layer , otherwise it is @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that one or more of the layers can be defect , since @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the exchange interaction and the transverse field of the defect layer .",
    "the ordered phase is characterized by the non zero mean values @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",

    "the substitution of la led to a marked decrease in @xmath62 to 180@xmath89c ( @xmath90=0.5 ) , because the induced a - site vacancies weaken the coupling between neighboring bo@xmath91 octahedra @xcite .",

    "the damping increases with decreasing of the film thickness , what is in agreement with our previous calculations without defects @xcite and with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the thinner the films the larger is the damping .",
    "based on a modified transverse ising model and using a green s function technique , the damping and the phase transition temperature for ferroelectric thin films with structural defects are calculated for the first time .",
    "the dependence on temperature , film thickness and interaction constants is discussed .",
    "it is shown that defect layers in fe thin films , layers with impurities or vacancies , as well as layers with dislocations , can induce strong increase or decrease of the critical temperature of fe phase transition due to different exchange interactions in the defect layers .",
    "we obtain that the damping in the thin films is always larger in comparison to the corresponding bulk values or to films without defects .",
    "there are different mechanisms in thin films which contribute additive to the damping , due to spin - spin , spin - phonon , surface , defects scattering etc .",
    "the damping in thin films is greater compared to the bulk case for example due to surface effects @xcite then due to spin - phonon interactions @xcite and to defects which are considered in the present paper .",
    "the damping is related to the width of the half - maximum for the raman scattering lines .",
    "it can be concluded , that if we want to obtain and to explain the large line broadening effects observed experimentally in thin films and nanoparticles @xcite all contributions to the damping must be taken into account and that the defects play an important role .",
