    "in conventional optics for light waves , goos - hnchen in 1947 discovered that a light beam under the condition of total reflection can experience a lateral shift ( or displacement ) along the surface of a dielectric boundary @xcite .",
    "this pioneering work has stimulated a large volume of studies @xcite  , concerning the goos - hnchen shift of reflected or transmitted @xcite light beams of different polarizations @xcite in different media characterized with , for example , periodic structures @xcite , ( left or right ) handedness @xcite , multilayers @xcite , weakly absorbing @xcite , lower - index @xcite or negative - index of refraction @xcite , etc .",
    "the key physics behind the goos - hnchen shift is the nature of wave interference .  from the perspective of wave optics ,",
    "the incident beam of a finite transverse width can be viewed as composed of plane wave components , each of which has a slightly different transverse wavevector .",
    "each wave component , after the total internal reflection , undergoes a different phase shift , and the superposition of all the reflected wave components gives rise to the lateral shift of the intensity peak in the reflected beam @xcite .    in this sense",
    ", it is not so much the total internal reflection but rather the phase modulations for different plane wave components that remains the true mechanism behind the lateral shift .",
    "thus , the goos - hnchen shift is expected to occur in matter waves where particles have finite masses .  as is known , under the usual conditions ( or temperatures ) ,",
    "electrons possess a de broglie s wavelength much longer than atoms because the latter is much heavier in mass than the former .  thus , it is much easier to demonstrate the goos - hnchen shift with electrons @xcite or even neutrons @xcite than with atoms .",
    "the situation , however , has been rapidly changed over the last two decades . nowadays ,",
    "ultracold atoms with a relatively long de broglie s wavelength can be routinely made available , thanks to the rapid advancement of the laser cooling and trapping technology .",
    "motivated by the fact that ultracold atoms have led to many important applications in atom optics @xcite , we explore , in this paper , the matter wave analog of goos - hnchen effect within the framework of atom optics where matter waves of ultracold atoms are manipulated by laser fields .",
    "an important difference between the matter waves in atom optics and the light waves in conventional optics is that atoms have internal electronic structures while photons are structureless .",
    "thus , an accurate description of the goos - hnchen effect in atom optics must regard atoms as particles possessing internal spins ( energy states ) .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , our work here represents the first that is seriously devoted to the problem of goos - hnchen effect with cold atoms .  as such",
    ", we limit our goals to establishing a general theoretical framework and to applying it for a basic understanding of the goos - hnchen effect in matter waves with cold two - level atoms , while at the same time hoping that our work can draw significant attentions from experimentalists for future applications .",

    "[ model ] , we derive a set of coupled 1-d schrdinger equations to describe the scattering of two - level atoms by a super - gaussian laser beam in a 2-d setting .  in the same section ,",
