    "any calculation in a gauge theory should be checked for its gauge dependence .",
    "unfortunately , nonperturbative calculations in light - front qed  @xcite have been limited to a single gauge , usually light - cone gauge .",
    "this is due to the need to solve the constraint equation for the nondynamical part of the fermion field , which is entangled with the photon field . a careful use of pauli ",
    "villars ( pv ) regularization  @xcite has been shown  @xcite to allow the use of feynman gauge , by providing cancellation of the photon - field dependence in the constraint equation .",
    "what is remarkable , however , is that this cancellation is actually not unique to feynman gauge but holds for any gauge .",
    "thus , nonperturbative calculations can be done in any gauge , provided the free - photon part of the hamiltonian can be constructed . here",
    "we provide such a construction for an arbitrary covariant gauge and apply the formalism to a calculation of the dressed - electron eigenstate and its anomalous magnetic moment , in order to investigate the gauge invariance of the result .",
    "this builds on earlier work on yukawa theory  @xcite and qed  @xcite , where pv particles are used to regulate a light - front hamiltonian and the eigenstates of the hamiltonian are computed in one or more charge sectors of the theory .",
    "the eigenstate is expanded in a truncated fock basis .",
    "the eigenvalue problem becomes a coupled set of integral equations for the wave functions , which are the coefficients of the fock states in the expansion .",
    "truncation keeps the coupled set finite in size , and the pv regularization keeps the integrations finite . for severe truncations ,",
    "the coupled set can be solved analytically . in general , the set is solved numerically  @xcite . the renormalization can be handled in a standard way , with the bare parameters of the original lagrangian fixed by physical constraints , or by a sector - dependent parameterization , where the bare parameters become dependent on the fock sectors connected by the terms in the hamiltonian  @xcite . however , in a weakly coupled theory such as qed , such an approach can not be expected to compete with high - order perturbation theory , due to numerical errors .",
    "consideration of qed is a test for a method intended for strongly coupled theories .",
    "light - cone coordinates  @xcite are used in order to have well - defined fock - state expansions , which are at the heart of the method .",

    "the mass - shell condition @xmath6 relates these as @xmath7 .",
    "the positivity of @xmath8 keeps the vacuum simple and prevents vacuum contributions to the fock expansions , except for the possibility of zero modes  @xcite .",
    "these modes of zero @xmath8 can be neglected in theories where symmetry breaking does not occur .",
    "our new construction of the hamiltonian is based on a light - front analog of the equal - time stueckelberg quantization of a massive vector field  @xcite .",
    "the stueckelberg quantization is known to allow for a zero - mass limit .",
    "it is also useful as a way to treat the physical and pv photons on an equal footing , consistent with the need to maintain the pv regularization .",
    "the quantization adds a fourth ( unphysical ) polarization to the three physical polarizations .",
    "the unphysical polarization is the only one that does not satisfy the lorentz gauge condition @xmath9 .",
    "however , it does satisfy the euler  lagrange field equation , because its four - momentum is placed on a different , gauge - dependent mass shell , chosen in just such a way as to satisfy the field equation .",
    "the key to the light - front analog is that the chosen mass shell is invoked for the minus component of the momentum , rather than the zero component .",
    "the details of this can be found below , in sec .",
    "[ sec : lightfrontqed ] .    with this new quantization , we can formulate mass eigenvalue problems for the eigenstates of qed in an arbitrary covariant gauge and test for the gauge invariance of physical quantities computed from the eigenstates .",
    "we expect that gauge invariance will be broken by approximations made in solving the eigenproblems .",
    "one such approximation is the fock - space truncation used to reduce the eigenproblem to a finite size .",
    "another is retention of finite values for the regulating pv masses ; the regularization is constructed with use of flavor - changing currents that explicitly break gauge invariance  @xcite and are removed only in the infinite - pv - mass limit , which may not be possible in a numerical calculation .    as a first test",
    ", we apply this formalism to a calculation of the dressed - electron eigenstate .",
    "fock space is truncated to include only the bare - electron state and the one - electron / one - photon states , plus their pv analogs .",
    "this leads to an analytically solvable problem , reduced to an effective @xmath10 matrix problem in the one - electron sector . from the solution ,",
    "the anomalous moment can be computed , from the zero - momentum - transfer limit of the spin - flip transition amplitude .    to obtain meaningful results ,",
    "it is important to maintain the chiral symmetry of the massless - electron limit .",
    "this is achieved by adjusting the coupling strengths of the pv photons , to ensure that the dressed mass is zero when the bare mass is zero . as will be seen below , in sec .",
    "[ sec : dressedelectron ] , this requires two pv - photon flavors in any gauge . however , one flavor is sufficient if the limit of infinite pv - fermion mass is taken .",
    "this also holds for the sector - dependent approach  @xcite , as we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : dressedelectron ] . in general , the constraint of chiral - symmetry restoration and the pv - photon couplings are gauge dependent .",
    "there are , of course , other nonperturbative methods .",
    "lattice gauge theory  @xcite is particularly successful , and use of dyson ",
    "schwinger equations  @xcite has produced notable results .",
    "however , these lack the direct access to wave functions in minkowski space , which light - front hamiltonian methods provide  @xcite .",
    "thus , the methods are quite complementary , particularly now that light - front calculations can be done in an arbitrary gauge .",
    "there are also a light - front lattice method , the transverse lattice  @xcite ; a light - front approach in terms of effective fields  @xcite ; and a supersymmetric formulation for discrete light - front hamiltonians specifically for supersymmetric theories  @xcite .",

    ", the normalization @xmath118 does have a singular contribution of the form @xmath119 .",
    "this comes from a combination of the last two terms of the curly bracket in ( [ eq : m1limit ] ) for @xmath15 and @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , the normalization contains an ir divergence in addition to its usual uv divergence , except in feynman gauge , where there is only a uv divergence .",
    "these divergences are the characteristic `` uncanceled divergences '' caused by fock - space truncation  @xcite .",
    "they arise in both the standard and sector - dependent parameterizations , although in the latter case the ir divergence is present even in feynman gauge  @xcite . for the standard parameterization used here , we find the divergences in the normalization factor .",
    "for the sector - dependent parameterization , the divergence is most easily seen by considering the probability for the one - electron / one - photon sector .",
    "this should be between zero and one , but the renormalization of the sector - dependent coupling absorbs the divergence in the normalization factor @xmath121 and allows the probability of the one - electron / one - photon sector to diverge . in this case , the overall norm of the eigenstate is maintained only because the probability for the bare - electron sector goes to negative infinity in such a way that the sum of probabilities is formally one .    because of the uncanceled divergences , not all of the pv masses can be taken to infinity and , except for our standard parameterization in feynman gauge , the physical photon mass can not be taken to zero .",
    "as argued in @xcite , the errors introduced by these limitations are to be minimized by seeking ranges of mass values over which results do not change significantly .",
    "this strikes a balance between the errors caused by the presence of unphysical pv fields and a nonzero photon mass and the errors associated with fock - space truncation .",
    "the former decrease with increasing pv masses ( as the pv fields are removed from the spectrum ) and decreasing photon mass ; the latter , the truncation errors , increase with increasing pv masses as the uncanceled divergences assert themselves .",
    "we have developed a formalism whereby nonperturbative calculations can be done for light - front qed in an arbitrary covariant gauge . the formalism combines a light - front stueckelberg quantization for the free photon field with a pauli  villars regularization that simplifies the constraint equation for the nondynamical part of the fermion field .",
    "the stueckelberg quantization allows the physical and pv photons to be handled in the same way , which facilitates the regularization and the preservation of symmetries . in feynman gauge , this quantization is equivalent to the gupta ",
