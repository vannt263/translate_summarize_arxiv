    "intergalactic hydrogen is almost completely ionized by @xmath2 @xcite , but the sources responsible for reionization are still not known ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews of the theoretical possibilities ) .",
    "a low neutral - hydrogen fraction is found at lower redshift even in relatively over - dense systems , despite the short ( compared to the hubble time ) recombination time - scale in those systems .",
    "this implies a continued supply of ionizing photons after reionization completed .",
    "measurements of the intensity of the ionizing background below @xmath3 @xcite are consistent with an ionizing background produced by observed quasars @xcite . at higher redshifts ,",
    "however , the declining abundance of bright quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that they can not provide an ionizing background sufficient to reionize the universe @xcite , and this conclusion is supported by deep x - ray surveys @xcite .",
    "recent results from the _ wmap _ satellite imply that reionization was substantially underway by @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "however , quasar absorption studies at @xmath5 @xcite suggest a dramatic evolution in the ionizing background around that redshift .",
    "some authors have reconciled the _ wmap _",
    "evidence for early reionization with the quasar result that reionization is just finishing at @xmath5 by postulating two reionizations of the universe @xcite , generally invoking a hard  stellar spectrum for the early reionization and a  stellar spectrum for the final reionization at @xmath5 .",
    "the most direct technique to ascertain the sources responsible for the ionizing background at high redshift is to take a census of all sources that contribute ionizing photons .",
    "the advantage of this technique is that the relative contribution of different types of sources are measured directly , as are the spatial distributions and other properties of the populations .",
    "unfortunately , the large luminosity distance to high redshift means that only the most luminous sources can be detected with current observational methods .",
    "for example , @xcite measure a power - law high - redshift quasar luminosity function with a steep slope , but estimate that the traditional power - law break of the quasar luminosity function would occur more than one magnitude below their survey limit : there is little constraint on the faint end of the quasar luminosity function from direct source detection .    a complementary method to direct detection is measurement of the properties of the integrated ionizing background .",
    "although this technique does not identify ionizing sources directly , it is effective at detecting ionization due to a very abundant population of low - luminosity sources .",
    "moreover , the shape of the integrated ionizing background is dictated by the combination of sources responsible for it ; different spectra arise from various possible contributors , such as quasars @xcite ,  ob stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the easiest way to make a crude measurement of the shape of the ionizing background is through the ionization state of photoionized igm gas ; in the next section we show explicitly how the background spectrum is related to the ionization state .",
    "atoms and ions with at least one bound electron in the ground state have strong bound - bound transition cross - sections , typically located at uv or soft x - ray energies .",
    "consequently , even small amounts of these species on the line of sight to a background source produce strong absorption features . the most common extragalactic application of this technique uses uv - bright quasars as the background sources ( for a recent review see * ?",

    "we examine the first ionization states of hydrogen and helium ; they are the most abundant elements in the igm , and are responsible for most of the uv opacity toward high - redshift quasars .",
    "specifically , we will investigate the relative neutral fractions of hydrogen and helium , which have first ionization potentials of 13.6 and 24.6  ev , respectively . since the photoionization cross - sections for  and  are peaked at threshold ,",

    ", down to the first ionization threshold of helium , at 504   .",
    "these wavelengths are the rest - frame values ; the observed wavelengths of these transitions depend on the redshift of the absorbing gas .",

    "is from the cumulative continuous absorption due to many absorbers at different redshifts , named the ` valley ' by @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated for in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ; once lyman limit absorption begins ( shortward of @xmath14   , where @xmath15 is the quasar redshift ) , the forest typically gives way to almost complete absorption .",
    "in such cases it is very difficult to observe helium forest lines because of the small residual continuum flux at short wavelengths . in rare cases",
    "the valley is not very pronounced , and the continuum is strong enough that the  584    forest region may be observed .",
    "we call the region of the  584    forest red - ward of  537  the `  band . '",
    "the identification of absorption features in spectra like those in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] can be difficult , especially in low - resolution spectra , except in the region red - ward of the ly@xmath16 forest , where the only possible absorption feature from hydrogen or helium is the hydrogen ly@xmath12  line .",

    "the  band is the analogous region for , where the  584  lines are the only source of helium opacity ; however , this region also may contain absorption due to all of the  lyman transitions , confusing the assignment of any individual line to . in principle ,",
    "unsaturated  lines could be identified because they are twice as narrow as unsaturated ly@xmath12  lines .",
    "however , line blending and the expected weakness of the  lines complicate a practical implementation of that criterion , and spectroscopy of sufficiently high resolution would require an extremely bright target .",
    "even after hydrogen reionization is complete at @xmath17 , the filamentary nature of the clumpy igm leads to significant ly@xmath12opacity in regions with neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath18 .",
    "a line of sight through the universe pierces many of these filaments at different redshifts , resulting in the ly@xmath12  forest described above .",
    "helium is expected to be singly reionized ( 24.6  ev ionization threshold ) at a similar redshift to hydrogen , for almost any expected ionizing spectrum .",
    "consequently , absorption by neutral helium at @xmath19 should be confined to the same filaments that give rise to hydrogen absorption .",
    "this justifies a one - to - one search for 584    lines at the same redshift as lines identified in the ` ly@xmath12band ' region , where the ly@xmath12  band is defined as the spectral region where absorbers with a  584    line in the  band exhibit ly@xmath12  absorption ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) .",
    "the application of absorption line studies of the igm is limited by the supply of suitable background sources , primarily quasars .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is a large photometric and spectroscopic survey of the northern sky that will identify and measure redshifts for almost all quasars brighter than 20th magnitude over one quarter of the sky . at the current discovery rate of the survey , it will find approximately 1000 quasars at @xmath20 , and about 200 at @xmath21 @xcite . as we will demonstrate",
    "( section [ sec : qsosel ] ) , rest - frame extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) absorption line study of @xmath0 quasars requires a large sample of quasars , and could only be realized with the large catalog of @xmath0 quasars that the sdss will provide .",
    "next we consider the relationship between the ionization state of igm absorbers and the ionizing background .",

    "thus predictions for  absorption from these systems can be easily made from calculations of the relative ionization states of helium and hydrogen .",
    "first we assume that the relative abundance of neutral helium to neutral hydrogen in an absorbing system with high  and fractions @xcite , and @xcite predict that the full helium reionization happens over a narrow redshift interval .",

    "the most important absorbers for measuring @xmath36 are systems where the observed equivalent widths of the ly@xmath12  forest absorption lines are roughly equal to the spectral resolution obtained in the ly@xmath12forest spectrum . for a typical spectral resolution of 0.27    ( a choice justified in section [ sec : losqso_sa ] )",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath37 at @xmath38 . at such column densities ,",
    "the optical depth to photons at the hydrogen ionization threshold is @xmath39 , thus the optically - thin approximation should be valid .",
    "however , optically thick absorbers can have a substantial impact on the spectrum of the ionizing background , both through absorption and emission .",
    "@xcite find that the mean uv background is attenuated by roughly a factor of 3 at both @xmath40 and @xmath41 ; additionally , much of the flux shortward of 228  is absorbed by  and re - emitted at 304    ( see * ? ? ?",
    "these changes to the unabsorbed spectrum have important implications for the  abundance , but do not affect the abundance ratio of  to .    because we are only concerned with the relative rate of neutral - helium ionizations to hydrogen ionizations ,",
    "we approximate the ionizing background by a power law , @xmath42 using a continuous star - formation history with metallicity @xmath43 and a salpeter imf from 1 to 100  m@xmath44 @xcite , the effective power - law index is @xmath45 . also of interest is the spectrum of very massive metal - free stars , which represent the most extreme expectation of the stellar imf at very high redshift : these stars are well approximated by a blackbody spectrum with temperature @xmath46 @xcite .",

    "one complication to the application of absorber statistics determined from other quasar samples to the population of quasars discovered by sdss is the quasar selection techniques employed .",
    "the sdss quasar selection primarily uses observed optical colors to generate a well - defined selection function @xcite ; by contrast , the quasars studied in absorption line surveys were culled from heterogeneous catalogs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "these observations require very long integrations with a 10-meter class telescope instrumented with a blue - sensitive low - dispersion spectrograph and an optical intermediate - resolution spectrograph .    finally , we examined the selection of the best quasar / los combination on which to perform our proposed experiment from the expected 200 sdss quasars at @xmath1 .",

    "we also consider the possibility that a quasar / los combination will be so good for our purposes that it falls outside of the sdss quasar color selection criteria .",
    "this is very unlikely for quasars with @xmath173 per cent or lower transmission , but about half of all quasars with 20 per cent transmission , should any exist , would be brighter in @xmath163 than the sdss quasar color selection limit of 22.6 .",

    "<S> we find that rest - frame extreme - uv  absorption will be detectable in deep spectral observations of some rare @xmath1 quasars ; the ratio of  to  absorption reflects the shape of the ionizing background in the photon energy range between 13.6 and 24.6  ev . </S>",
