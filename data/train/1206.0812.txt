    "over the past few decades the existence of neutrino oscillations has been confirmed in a number of experiments .",

    "we will discuss the two - neutrino oscillation as a specific example of our formalism and then , it will be much clearer about how such corrections influence the dependence of transition probabilities on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in general the number of massive neutrinos can be larger than 3 , for instance , the existence of sterile neutrinos is largely discussed ( see  @xcite for a brief review ) .",
