    "the understanding of neutrino propagation in matter is also important for astrophysics , cosmology and even geology applications .",
    "the use of heavy nuclear targets in neutrino experiments is motivated by the need to collect a statistically significant number of interactions .",
    "for this reason , the understanding of nuclear effects is of primary importance for a correct interpretation of experimental results and for the evaluation of the corresponding uncertainties .",
    "an example of such synergy is provided by the precision electroweak measurements from neutrino interactions .",
    "the role of nuclear corrections to neutrino structure functions has recently been emphasized  @xcite in the context of the anomalous measurement of the weak mixing angle ( @xmath2 ) reported by the nutev collaboration  @xcite .",
    "an accurate account of nuclear effects is not only important in the determination of electroweak parameters in neutrino scattering experiments , but also for the understanding of neutrino masses and mixing .",
    "the next generation experiments would imply precision measurements to disentangle small oscillation signals from neutrino and antineutrino interactions on nuclei .",
    "this in turn would require us to improve our knowledge of @xmath3-nucleus cross - sections in order to reduce systematic uncertainties .",

    "the construction of a neutrino factory  @xcite would then allow a further step forward , finally reaching the ultimate precision of the neutrino probe .    in this work we present a calculation of inelastic neutrino - nucleus structure functions ( sf ) and differential cross sections in a wide kinematical range of the bjorken variable @xmath4 and momentum transfer squared @xmath5 .",
    "our goal is to develop a quantitative model incorporating existing data , which would be useful in interpreting @xmath3 experiments .    scattering experiments with charged leptons",

    "we extend this approach to neutrino - nucleus inelastic scattering .",
    "although nuclear scattering mechanisms for high - energy charged leptons and neutrinos are similar in many respects ( especially in the impulse approximation ) , there are important differences due to the presence of the axial - vector current in neutrino interactions .",

    ", we separate the contributions to different sf according to their @xmath7-parity .",
    "we examine in detail the dependence of nuclear effects on @xmath7-parity and show that it is particulary important in the nuclear shadowing region . results are then used to predict nuclear structure functions for neutrino and antineutrino interactions , respectively .    in contrast to the electromagnetic current",
    ", the axial current is not conserved , and for this reason the neutrino structure functions in the region of low @xmath5 and small @xmath4 are rather different from those of electroproduction .",
    "in particular , the neutrino longitudinal sf @xmath9 ( as well as @xmath10 ) does not vanish at low @xmath5 .",
    "its value is determined by the divergence of the axial - vector current which is linked to the virtual pion cross - section ( adler relation @xcite ) .",

    "we also address the phenomenological implications of this relation in the description of low-@xmath5 and low-@xmath4 neutrino differential cross sections .",

    "note that the approach discussed was successfully applied in the analysis of charged - lepton nuclear data ( the nuclear emc effect ) @xcite .",
    "the comparison with neutrino data provides an independent verification of our model and also allows a compatibility check between ( anti)neutrinos and charged leptons .",
    "in general , we observe good agreement between data and our predictions for all nuclei .",
    "we note that this also includes the lowest @xmath5 data points , which in the case of chorus are at @xmath384 .",
    "the @xmath5 dependence in the low @xmath4 bins is also reproduced , as can be seen from the @xmath385 distributions and by comparing different ( anti)neutrino energies .",
    "the existing cross - section data in the low @xmath4 and low @xmath5 region support the presence of the pcac term in the longitudinal structure function .",
    "a value of the scale @xmath386 gev seems to provide the best agreement with data .    after verifying the consistency of our cross - section model with ( anti)neutrino data ,",
    "it is interesting to use the model to examine the compatibility of data from different experiments and nuclear targets . at small and intermediate values of @xmath4 the three experiments are in agreement for both the neutrino and antineutrino samples . at large values of @xmath387",
    "the nutev data seem to be systematically above calculations for most neutrino energies . on the other hand ,",
    "the corresponding predictions for @xmath388c and @xmath330pb at large @xmath4 are in agreement with nomad and chorus data , respectively .",
    "the low-@xmath5 and low-@xmath4 behaviour of the ( anti)neutrino cross section is dominated by the divergence of the axial current and pcac relation . however , as discussed in section  [ sec : sf : low - q ] , the scale controlling the pcac contribution to the longitudinal structure function is not well known .",
    "the use of heavy targets introduces additional uncertainties .",
    "the miner@xmath0a experiment  @xcite , recently proposed at fermilab and currently under construction , has the possibility to address pcac effect ( as well as other nuclear effects ) in heavy nuclei .",
    "to this end , the possibility to have cryogenic hydrogen and deuterium targets would greatly enhance the corresponding physics potential .",
    "we discussed inelastic inclusive scattering of high - energy ( anti)neutrino off nuclei and developed a quantitative model for nuclear structure functions using an approach which takes into account the qcd treatment of the nucleon structure functions and addresses the basic nuclear effects including nuclear shadowing , fermi motion and nuclear binding , nuclear pions and off - shell corrections to bound nucleon structure functions .",
    "the presence of both the axial and the vector currents in neutrino interactions results in contributions with different @xmath7-parity to neutrino cross sections .",
    "the interference between the vector and the axial current is described by the structure function @xmath8 which is not present in charged - lepton scattering .",
    "we discussed in detail how the nuclear effects depend on the structure function type ( @xmath10 vs @xmath178 ) and on the @xmath7-parity of structure functions ( @xmath7-even @xmath277 and @xmath7-odd @xmath278 combinations ) .",
    "the axial - vector current plays a special role in neutrino scattering in the region of low @xmath5 and low @xmath4 . in this region",
    "the cross sections are dominated by contributions from the divergence of the axial current which is linked to the virtual pion cross section via the adler relation .",
    "using pcac we examined the derivation of low @xmath5 and low @xmath4 limit for neutrino structure functions and discussed the scale in @xmath5 at which the adler relation can be applied .",
    "we studied this problem phenomenologically using low-@xmath5 and low-@xmath4 neutrino cross - section data .",
    "we examined the adler and the gross  llewellyn - smith sum rules for nuclear structure functions .",
    "a remarkable cancellation between nuclear shadowing and off - shell corrections was found , underlying the conservation of isospin and valence quark number in nuclei .",
    "this fact was used to constrain the effective scattering amplitude controlling the nuclear shadowing for different @xmath7-parity and isospin states .",
    "we applied our results to calculate nuclear structure functions for the targets and kinematical conditions typical for recent neutrino experiments .",
    "our predictions for the ( anti)neutrino inelastic differential cross - sections agree well with the recent data on @xmath388c @xcite , @xmath389fe @xcite , and @xmath330pb @xcite .",
    "we conclude by commenting that the nuclear corrections prove to be particularly important for qcd phenomenology of @xmath3 data on heavy targets , where they significantly affect the fit results  @xcite .",
    "we thank s. alekhin , a. butkevich , a. kataev , and s. mishra for useful discussions and comments , j. panman for providing the tables of chorus cross - section data , m. tzanov for useful information about the nutev cross sections , and the nomad collaboration for the use of their preliminary data .",

    "the parametrization of the pion  nucleon forward scattering amplitude based on a regge fit to @xmath357 scattering data is given in ref.@xcite : @xmath390 + \\frac{y_1}{2 } s^{-\\eta_1 }      \\left[i-\\cot\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}({1-\\eta_1})\\right)\\right ] , \\\\",
