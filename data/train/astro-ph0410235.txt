    "one of the primary goals of modern cosmology is to answer the question :  when did galaxies begin to form in the early universe and how did they form ? \"",
    "theorists predict that the formation of galaxies is a gradual process in which progressively larger , virialized masses , composed mostly of dark matter , harbor star formation as time elapses .",
    "these dark - matter halos , which harbor stellar populations , then undergo a process of hierarchical merging and evolution to become the galaxies that make up the local universe . in order to understand what are the earliest building blocks of galaxies like our own , one must detect and identify  first light \" sources , i.e , the emission from the first objects in the universe to undergo star formation .",
    "the standard picture is that at zero metallicity the jeans mass in star forming clouds is much higher than it is in the local universe , and , therefore , the formation of massive stars , say , 100 m@xmath1 or higher , is highly favored .",
    "the spectral distributions of these massive stars are characterized by effective temperatures on the main sequence ( ms ) around @xmath2  k ( _ e.g. , _ tumlinson & shull 2000 , bromm _ et al . _  2001 ,",
    "marigo _ et al . _",
    "2001 ) . due to their temperatures",
    "these stars are very effective in ionizing hydrogen and helium .",
    "it should be noted that zero - metallicity ( the so - called population iii ) stars of all masses have essentially the same ms luminosities as , but are much hotter than their solar metallicity analogues .",
    "note also that only stars hotter than about 90,000  k are capable of ionizing he twice in appreciable quantities , say , more than about 10% of the total he content ( _ e.g. , _ oliva & panagia 1983 , tumlinson & shull 2000 ) . as a consequence",
    "even the most massive population iii stars can produce heii lines only for a relatively small fraction of their lifetimes , say , about 1  myr or about 1/3 of their lifetimes .",
    "the second generation of stars forming out of pre - enriched material will probably have different properties because cooling by metal lines may become a viable mechanism and stars of lower masses may be produced ( bromm _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the metallicity is lower than about @xmath3z@xmath1 , build up of h@xmath4 due to self - shielding may occur , thus continuing the formation of very massive stars ( oh & haiman 2002 ) .",
    "thus , it appears that in the zero - metallicity case one may expect a very top - heavy initial mass function ( imf ) , whereas it is not clear if the second generation of stars is also top - heavy or follows a normal imf .",
    "the high effective temperatures of zero - metallicity stars imply not only high ionizing photon fluxes for both hydrogen and helium , but also low optical and uv fluxes . as a result",
    ", one should expect the rest - frame optical / uv spectrum of a primordial hii regions to be largely dominated by its nebular emission ( both continuum and lines ) , so that the best strategy to detect the presence of primordial stars is to search for the emission from associated hii regions .        in panagia _",
    "et al . _  ( 2004 , in preparation ) we report on our calculations of the properties of primordial , zero - metallicity hii regions ( _ e.g. , _",
    "figure  1 ) .",
    "we find that the electron temperatures is in excess of 20,000 k and that 45% of the total luminosity is converted into the ly-@xmath5 line , resulting in a ly-@xmath5 equivalent width ( ew ) of 3000  ( bromm , kudritzki & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "the helium lines are also strong , with the heii @xmath61640 intensity comparable to that of h@xmath7 ( tumlinson _ et al . _  2001 ,",
    "panagia _ et al . _  2004 , in preparation )",
    ". an interesting feature of these models is that the continuum longwards of ly-@xmath5 is dominated by the two - photon nebular continuum .",
    "the h@xmath5/h@xmath7 ratio for these models is 3.2 .",
    "both the red continuum and the high h@xmath5/h@xmath7 ratio could be naively ( and _ incorrectly _ ) interpreted as a consequence of dust extinction even though no dust is present in these systems .    from the observational point of view one will generally be unable to measure a zero - metallicity but will usually be able to place an upper limit to it . when would such an upper limit be indicative that one is dealing with a population iii object ? according to miralda - escud & rees ( 1998 ) a metallicity z@xmath8 can be used as a dividing line between the pre- and post - re - ionization universe .",
    "a similar value is obtained by considering that the first supernova ( sn ) going off in a primordial cloud will pollute it to a metallicity of @xmath9  ( panagia _ et al . _  2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "thus , any object with a metallicity higher than @xmath10 is not a true first generation object .",
    "we have also computed model hii regions for metallicities from three times solar down to @xmath11  ( panagia _ et al . _",
    "2004 , in preparation ) . in figure  1 the synthetic spectrum of an hii region with metallicity @xmath12 ( third panel from the top ) can be compared to that of an object with zero metallicity ( top panel ) .",
    "the two are very similar except for a few weak metal lines .",
    "it is also apparent that values of ew in excess of 1,000 are possible already for objects with metallicity @xmath10 .",
    "this is particularly interesting given that ly-@xmath5 emitters with large ew have been identified at z=5.6 ( rhoads & malhotra 2001 ) .",
    "@xmath13 / h@xmath7 is plotted as a function of metallicity for three different stellar temperatures : 30,000k ( open squares and lower line ) , 50,000k ( solid diamonds ) , and 100,000k ( solid squares and upper line ) .",
    ", width=264 ]    the metal lines are weak , but some of them can be used as metallicity tracers . in figure",
    "2 the intensity ratio of the [ oiii]@xmath13 line to h@xmath7 is plotted for a range of stellar temperatures and metallicities .",
    "we notice that for @xmath14 this line ratio traces metallicity linearly .",
    "our reference value @xmath15 corresponds to a ratio [ oiii]/h@xmath7 = 0.1 .",
    "the weak dependence on stellar temperature makes sure that this ratio remains a good indicator of metallicity also when one considers the integrated signal from a population with a range of stellar masses .",
    "another difference between zero - metallicity and low - metallicity hii regions lies in the possibility that the latter may contain dust . for a @xmath16 hii region dust may absorb up to 30 % of the ly-@xmath5 line , resulting in roughly 15 % of the energy being emitted in the far ir ( panagia _ et al . _",
    "2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "it is natural to wonder whether primordial hii regions will be observable with the generation of telescopes currently on the drawing boards . in this section",
    "we will focus mostly on the capabilities of the james webb space telescope ( _ jwst _ ; _ e.g. _  stiavelli _ et al . _  ) . here",
    "we consider a starburst with @xmath17 m@xmath1 in massive stars(which corresponds to a ly-@xmath5 luminosity of @xmath18 l@xmath1 ) as our reference model .",
    "starburst object at z=15 containing @xmath19 m@xmath1 in massive stars ( thin line ) compared to the imaging limit of @xmath20 at r=5 ( thick line ) .",
    "the @xmath20 sensitivity refers to @xmath21 s exposures with s / n=10 .",

    "the @xmath20 sensitivity refers to @xmath22 exposures with s / n=10 .",
    ", width=264 ]    the synthetic spectra , after allowance for igm hi absorption of the ly-@xmath5 radiation ( _ e.g. _  miralda - escud & rees 1998 , madau & rees 2001 ) and convolution with suitable filter responses are compared to the  _ jwst _ imaging sensitivity for @xmath21s exposures in figure  3 .",
    "it is clear that  _ jwst _ will be able to easily detect such objects . due to the high background from the ground ,  _ jwst _",
    "will remain superior even to 30 m ground based telescopes for these applications .",
    "the synthetic spectra can also be compared to the  _ jwst _ spectroscopic sensitivity for @xmath22 exposures ( see figure  4 ) .",
    "it appears that while the ly-@xmath5 line can be detected up to @xmath23 , for our reference source only at relatively low redshifts ( z@xmath24 ) can  _ jwst _ detect other diagnostics lines lines such as heii 1640 , and balmer lines .",
    "determining metallicities is then limited to lower redshifts or to brighter sources .",
    "luminosity of the ionizing stars ( left - hand scale ) and top - heavy imf star formation rate ( right - hand scale ) to detect various emission lines using @xmath20 spectroscopy , with s / n=10 in integrations of 100 hours , as a function of the source redshift .",
    ", width=253 ]    we can reverse the argument and ask ourselves what sources can  _ jwst _ detect and characterize with spectroscopic observations",
    ". figure  5 displays , as a function of redshift , the total luminosity of a starburst whose lines can be detected with a s / n=10 for a @xmath21s exposure time .",
    "the loci for ly-@xmath5 , heii 1640 , h@xmath7 , and [ oiii ] 5007 are shown .",
    "it appears that ly-@xmath5 is readily detectable up to z@xmath2520 , the heii 1640 line may also be detected up to high redshifts , whereas  metallicity \" information , _",
    "i.e. _ the intensity ratio i([oiii])/i(h@xmath7 ) , can be obtained at high z only for sources that are @xmath26 times more massive or that are magnified @xmath26 times by gravitational lensing .",
    "even if _ jwst _ can not detect individual massive population iii stars , supernova explosions may come to the rescue . in the local universe supernovae ( sne )",
    "can be as bright as an entire galaxy ( _ e.g. _ , type ia supernovae ( snia ) at maximum light have m@xmath27 - 19.5 ) and are detectable up to large distances .",
    "however , snia , originating from moderate mass stars , are not expected to occur during the first 1 billion years after big bang .",
    "in addition , snia are efficient emitters only at rest frame wavelengths longer than 2600a , which makes them hard to detect at high redshifts ( panagia 2003a , b ) . type ii supernovae ( snii ) are much more efficient uv emitters but only rarely they are as bright as a snia . as a consequence , they will barely be detected at redshifts higher than 10 , or , if they are exceptionally bright (  la sn 1979c or sn 1998s ) they would be rare events ( panagia 2003a , b ) .",
    "on the other hand , massive population iii stars are much more massive than pop ii or pop i stars , and the resulting supernovae may have properties very different from those of local universe sne .",
    "heger et al ( 2001 ) have considered the fate of massive stars in conditions of zero metallicity and have found that for stellar progenitors with masses in the range 140 - 260 m@xmath1 the sn explosions would be caused by a pair - production instability and would be 3 to 100 times more powerful than core - collapse ( type ii and type ib / c ) sne , so that a pop  iii sn at a redshift of z = 20 could attain a peak flux of about 100 njy at 5 @xmath28 .",
    "such a high flux would be easily detectable with _ jwst _ observations made with an integration time of a few hours .",
    "next point to consider is :  do pop  iii sne occur frequently enough to be found in a systematic search ? \" for a standard cosmology ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , h@xmath31 , @xmath32 ) , and assuming that at z=20 a fraction @xmath33 of all baryons goes into stars of 250 m@xmath1 , heger _",
    "( 2001 ) predict an overall rate of 0.16 events per second over the entire sky , or about @xmath34 events per second per square degree . since for these primordial sne",
    "the first peak of the light curve lasts about a month , about a dozen of these sne per square degree should be at the peak of their light curves at any time . therefore , by monitoring about 100 nircam fields with integration times of about 10,000 seconds at regular intervals ( every few months ) for a year should lead to the discovery of three of these primordial supernovae .",
    "we conclude that , with a significant investment of observing time ( a total of 4,000,000 seconds ) and with a little help from mother nature ( to endorse our theorists views ) ,  _ jwst _ will be able to detect _ individually _ the very first stars and light sources in the universe .    baraffe i. , heger a. , woosley s. e. , 2001 , apj , 550 , 890 bromm v. , ferrara a. , coppi p. s. , larson r. b. , 2001 , mnras , 328 , 969 bromm v. , kudritzki r. p. , loeb , a. , 2001 , apj , 552 , 464 heger a. , woosley s. e. , baraffe i. , abel t. , 2001 , astro - ph 0112059 madau p. , rees m. j. , 2001 , apj , 551 , l27 marigo p. , girardi l. , chiosi c. , wood p. r. 2001 , a&a 371 , 252 miralda - escud j. , rees m. j. , 1998 , apj , 497 , 21 oh s. p. , haiman z. , 2002 , apj , 569 , 558 oliva e. , panagia n. , 1983 , ap&ss , 94 , 437 panagia n. , 2003a , in  supernovae and gamma - ray bursters \" , ed . k. w. weiler ( berlin : springer - verlag ) , p. 113",
