    "the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions has been the subject of an intense experimental research that confirmed its predictions for the interactions between fermions and vector bosons @xcite .",
    "however , some elements of the sm , such as the symmetry breaking mechanism and the interaction among the gauge bosons , have not been the object of direct experimental observation yet . in particular ,",
    "the structure of the triple and quartic vector - boson couplings is completely determined by the @xmath1 gauge structure of the model , and a detailed study of these interactions can either further confirm the local gauge invariance of the theory or indicate the existence of new physics beyond the sm .    presently only hadronic colliders have directly studied the triple vertex @xmath6 @xcite ; however , their constraints on this coupling are very loose .",
    "one of the main goals of lep ii at cern will be the investigation of the reaction @xmath7 , which can furnish direct bounds on anomalous @xmath6 and @xmath8 interactions @xcite .",
    "future hadron @xcite and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 @xcite colliders will also provide information on these couplings and improve significantly our knowledge of possible anomalous gauge - boson interactions .    direct studies of quartic vector - boson interactions can not be performed at the colliders in operation since the available centre - of - mass energy is not sufficient for multiple vector - boson production .",
    "this crucial test of the gauge structure of the sm will be possible only at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) through the reaction @xmath12 @xcite or at the next linear collider ( nlc ) through the processes @xmath13 @xcite , @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath16 @xcite , and @xmath17 @xcite , where @xmath18 @xmath0 , @xmath19 or @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "however , these machines will not operate in the near future , and consequently we will have to rely on indirect information on the quartic vertices for quite some time .",
    "valuable information on anomalous interactions can also be gathered from the low energy data @xcite and the results of the @xmath0 physics @xcite , which can also constrain substantially the possible deviations of the gauge boson self - interactions from the sm predictions through their contributions to the electroweak radiative corrections .",
    "so far all the analyses have concentrated on operators which generate tree - level modifications to the gauge - boson two - point or three - point functions .    in this work ,",
    "we obtain the constraints on quartic vector - boson self - interactions arising from the precision measurements at lep and the slc .",
    "we focus our attention on genuinely anomalous quartic operators , _",
    "i.e. _ operators that do not modify the trilinear vertices .",
    "these anomalous interactions can not be constrained by the direct lep ii analysis of the vertices @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in general ,",
    "anomalous quartic couplings arise as the low - energy limit of heavy state exchange , whereas trilinear couplings are modified by integrating out heavy fields .",
    "therefore , deviations on the triple gauge - vector couplings should be harder to observe than the ones on the quartic couplings , since the former are suppressed by factors of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is even possible to conceive extensions of the sm where the trilinear couplings remain unchanged , while the quartic vertices receive new contributions .",
    "for instance , the introduction of a new heavy scalar singlet , which interacts strongly with the higgs sector of the sm , enhances the quartic vector - boson interaction without affecting either the triple vector - boson couplings or the sm predictions for the @xmath27 parameter @xcite .    at the one - loop level ,",
    "anomalous quartic vector - boson interactions contribute to the @xmath0 pole physics through universal corrections to the gauge - boson self - energies .",
    "in general , the oblique radiative corrections can be parametrized in terms of three observables @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 @xcite , or equivalently @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "we shall obtain the constraints on anomalous quartic vertices by imposing that their one - loop contributions are compatible with the @xmath0 pole data @xcite . since the slc and lep i achieved a precision of the order of a per mille in some observables ,",
    "the @xmath0 pole physics is the best available source of information on quartic vector - boson interactions .",
    "if the electroweak symmetry breaking is due to a heavy ( strongly interacting ) higgs boson , which can be effectively removed from the physical low - energy spectrum , or to no fundamental higgs scalar at all , one is led to consider the most general effective lagrangian which employs a nonlinear representation of the spontaneously broken @xmath1 gauge symmetry @xcite .",
    "the resulting chiral lagrangian is a non - renormalizable non - linear @xmath34 model coupled in a gauge - invariant way to the yang - mills theory .",
    "this model independent approach incorporates by construction the low - energy theorems @xcite , that predict the general behavior of goldstone boson amplitudes irrespective of the details of the symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "notwithstanding , unitarity implies that this low - energy effective theory should be valid up to some energy scale smaller than @xmath35 tev , where new physics would come into play .    to specify the effective lagrangian",
    "one must first fix the symmetry breaking pattern .",
    "we consider that the system presents a global @xmath36 symmetry that is broken to @xmath4 . with this choice",
    ", the building block of the chiral lagrangian is the dimensionless unimodular matrix field @xmath37 , which transforms under @xmath36 as @xmath38 : @xmath39 where the @xmath40 fields are the would - be goldstone fields and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) are the pauli matrices .",
    "the @xmath45 covariant derivative of @xmath46 is defined as @xmath47 at this point , it is convenient to introduce the following auxiliary quantities @xmath48 which are @xmath49-covariant and @xmath50-invariant .",
    "notice that @xmath29 is not invariant under @xmath4 custodial due to the appearance of @xmath51 in its expression .",
    "the lowest - order terms in the derivative expansion of the effective lagrangian are @xmath52 + \\beta_1 g'^2\\frac{v^2}{4 } \\left ( \\hbox{tr } \\left [ t v_\\mu \\right ] \\right ) ^2 \\ ; . \\label{lagran2}\\ ] ] the first term of the above equation is responsible for giving mass to the gauge bosons @xmath19 and @xmath0 for @xmath53 .",
    "the second term violates the custodial @xmath4 symmetry and contributes to @xmath54 at the tree level , being strongly constrained by the low - energy data .",
    "this term can be understood as the low - energy remnant of the high - energy custodial symmetry breaking physics , which has been integrated out above a certain scale @xmath55 .",
    "moreover , at the one - loop order , it is also required in order to cancel the divergences in @xmath54 , arising from diagrams containing a hypercharge boson in the loop @xcite .",
    "this subtraction renders @xmath54 finite , although dependent on the renormalization scale .    at the next order in the derivative expansion @xmath2 ,",
    "there are many operators that can be written down @xcite .",

    "we used dimensional regularization @xcite to evaluate the one - loop contributions from the effective interactions ( [ eff:4 ] )  ( [ eff:10 ] ) , in order to preserve gauge invariance and to keep the ordering of the different contributions simple .",
    "in analogy to what happens for chiral lagrangians applied to low - energy qcd @xcite , the electroweak chiral lagrangian leads to an expansion in powers of the momentum @xmath84 and the weak coupling constant @xmath68 . this @xmath68 dependence is due to the introduction of new degrees of freedom associated to the gauge bosons . at a given order in @xmath68 and @xmath84",
    ", there are just a finite number of operators and loop diagrams that contribute to a process .",
    "therefore , the effective theory renormalization can be carried out by renormalizing the coupling constants of the operators that appear in the process at the order that the analysis is being done . in this work ,",
    "we evaluate the one - loop contributions from @xmath2 interactions , where @xmath85 counts the number of derivative plus the numbers of gauge bosons in the operator , which lead to @xmath86 corrections . in a complete calculation",
    ", we should also include the effects of two - loop graphs of @xmath87 operators and tree - level contributions from @xmath88 operators . at the end of the day , the experimental results for the oblique parameters would constrain combinations of the coupling constants appearing in the @xmath87 , @xmath2 , and @xmath88 operators @xcite .",
    "however , this next - to - next - to - leading order calculation contains a large number of free parameters that reduces its usefulness .",
    "notwithstanding , we can bound the anomalous quartic interactions from their oblique corrections under the naturalness assumption that no cancelation takes place amongst the @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 contributions that appear at the same order in the expansion .",
    "the motivation for this assumption is that the effects of the new physics and states from higher - energy scales must manifest themselves in a very clear way , otherwise they are very hard to observe .",
    "our procedure to bound the operators ( [ eff:4 ] )  ( [ eff:10 ] ) is the following : first we evaluate their oblique corrections using dimensional regularization .",
    "then , we use the leading non - analytic contributions from the loop diagrams to constrain the quartic interactions  that is , we keep only the terms proportional to log@xmath92 , dropping all others . the contributions that are relevant for our analysis",
    "are easily obtained by the substitution @xmath93 where @xmath55 is the energy scale which characterizes the appearance of new physics .    using the above procedure",
    ", we obtained that @xmath94 and that only @xmath72 is non - vanishing for all the quartic anomalous interactions , being given by @xmath95 for @xmath61 , @xmath96 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 e @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "our calculation has been done in a general @xmath3 gauge and we have explicitly verified the cancellation of the @xmath97-dependent terms , indicating that our result is gauge - invariant .",
    "ward identities relate the two- and three - point functions , and consequently the anomalous contributions to the two - point functions are gauge - independent since there is no one - loop three - point contribution due to the effective quartic interactions .",
    "our first step towards obtaining the bounds on the anomalous quartic vertices is to determine the sm contribution to @xmath31 . as discussed above",
    ", the gauge - boson contribution to this parameter is infinite as a consequence of the absence of the elementary higgs . on the other hand",
    ", we must also include the tree level effect due to the @xmath98 operator in eq .",
    "( [ lagran2 ] ) , which absorbs this infinity through the renormalization of the @xmath98 constant .",
    "if the renormalization condition is imposed at a scale @xmath55 , we are left with the contribution due to the running of @xmath98 from the scale @xmath55 to @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , the sm contribution without the higgs boson will be the same as that of the sm with an elementary higgs , with the substitution @xmath100 .",
    "we show in table [ limits ] the 90% cl constraints on the quartic anomalous vector - boson interactions which are obtained from eq.([epsilons ] ) assuming that @xmath101 tev . in this case",
    "the sm contribution to @xmath31 is in the range ( @xmath102@xmath103)@xmath104 for @xmath105@xmath106 gev .",
    "our bounds for @xmath107 and @xmath108 agree with the ones in ref.@xcite which were obtained in the unitary gauge .",
    "it is interesting to notice that our analysis does not show any indication of new physics beyond the sm since all the anomalous couplings are compatible with zero at 90% cl .",
    "a natural order of magnitude of the anomalous couplings @xmath109 in a fundamental gauge theory is @xmath110 @xcite , since the quartic anomalous interactions can be generated by tree diagrams .",
    "thus , we might expect that the size of the @xmath78 s should be of the order of @xmath111 . from our results",
    "we see that only the operators that break the custodial @xmath4 symmetry , ( @xmath112 ) get limits close to this expectation .",
    "future colliders will be able to search for anomalous quartic interactions through multiple gauge - boson production .",
    "assuming , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , that an anomalous coupling is observable at the lhc if it induces a 50% change in the integrated cross section for the production of pairs @xmath113 ( @xmath114 , @xmath0 ) , it will be possible to detect the couplings @xmath107 and @xmath108 provided they satisfy @xmath115 . these constraints are stronger than the limits obtained from the @xmath0 physics , as also concluded in ref.@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the capabilities of the nlc to study quartic anomalous couplings via the production mechanisms @xmath116 and @xmath117 are analysed , this last mechanism being the one yielding stronger constraints . using their values for the @xmath118 cross section associated with the couplings @xmath119",
    ", we translated their results into 90% cl limits @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 .",
    "these future direct bounds are weaker than the limits already imposed by the lep data for most of the quartic anomalous couplings .",
    "therefore , we can see that our results show that only the lhc can improve what we have learned from the radiative corrections at the @xmath0 pole .    summarizing , we have analyzed the effects of possible anomalous quartic vector - boson interactions that appear in a scenario where there is no particle associated to the symmetry - breaking sector in the low - energy spectrum . using a chiral lagrangian at the order @xmath2 and an arbitrary gauge @xmath3 , we draw the limits on the anomalous interactions @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath123 arising from the precision measurements at the @xmath0 pole .",
    "we extended previous results by considering all possible anomalous couplings that appear at order @xmath2 and by working in an arbitrary @xmath3 gauge .",
    "our analysis shows that , with the present limits , these anomalous couplings are already out of reach of a 500 gev @xmath9 collider for most of the values of @xmath83 .",
