    "fig.[fig2 ] shows the dos as a function of energy for different polarization @xmath94 and magnetization angle @xmath5 .",
    "it is clearly observed that the dos displays a dip structure with the energy . for nonzero energy ,",
    "the dos increases with increasing @xmath94 , however decreases with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "this is caused by the different tunneling rates for up and down spins owing to the splitting of dos of the ferromagnetic leads .",
    "this splitting acts as an effective magnetic field@xcite reaching values much larger than externally applied magnetic field@xcite .",
    "this results in a spin dependence of the dos in the central region . while at the zero energy point , the dos is independent of @xmath94 and @xmath5 .",
    "this stems from the nature of dirac point in the graphene .",
    "the bias dependence of the electrical current and the differential conductance @xmath95 are shown in fig.[fig3 ] for parallel electrodes magnetizations and for the different polarization @xmath94 , the nonlinear behaviour of @xmath96 and the strong dip at zero bias are in line with the experimental observations @xcite , and are at variance with the typical behaviour when a fermi liquid were in central region instead of graphene . in that case",
    "the electrical current is proportional to the applied voltage at small bias and obey the ohmic law@xcite .",
    "the results obtained here resemble rather the ferromagnet - insulator - ferromagnet(fm - i - fm ) junctions@xcite@xcite .",
    "the reason is that : the dos in graphene diminishes at the fermi level .",
    "hence , graphene sheet can be viewed as a tunneling barrier at the zero energy point , similar to fm - i - fm system . with increasing the polarization @xmath94 , the portion of spin - up electron states increases while for the spin - down electrons decreases .",
    "however , the scattering of the former is larger than that of the latter , thus we conclude that the conductance @xmath96 decreases with increasing @xmath94 at nonzero bias ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] ( b ) ) . while @xmath96 is almost independent of @xmath94 at zero bias , which stems from the fact that the spin transport through the dirac point of graphene is ballistic due to its insulator - like properties .    the bias dependence of the conductance at different temperatures @xmath97 and angles @xmath5 are shown in fig.[fig4 ] : the conductance is roughly independent of @xmath97 at large bias . near @xmath98",
    "the conductance increases with increasing @xmath97 .",
    "this behavior is also in contrast to usual fermi liquids where the conductance decreases with increasing temperature because thermal fluctuations enhance the scattering of conduction electrons and thereby contributes to the resistance of system @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the graphene is equivalent to a barrier at the zero energy point . near zero bias voltage ,",
    "the thermally excited electrons are dominant in tunneling process .",
    "therefore , with increasing temperatures , the increase of the thermally excited electrons enhances the conductance . on the other hand for large bias , the contributions to the conductance stem mainly from electrons with excess energies well above the fermi level ( as dictated by the applied voltage ) which leads to a very weak dependence of the conductance on the temperature at large bias .",
    "the conductance as a function of @xmath5 ( fig.[fig4 ] ( b ) ) follows the conventional behaviour of magnetic junctions such as the ferromagnet - quantum dot - ferromagnet system @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "when @xmath99 changes from @xmath100 to @xmath101 the number of spin - up and spin - down electrons is rearranged .",
    "fig.[fig5 ] shows tmr ratio as a function of the applied voltage for different polarizations @xmath94 and temperatures @xmath97 .",
    "a pronounced cusp - like feature appears at zero bias in line with experimental observations@xcite .",
    "we assign this behaviour to the result of a non - trivial combined effect of graphene and conventional spin - valve properties , evidenced by the dependence of tmr on the polarization @xmath94 at a fixed bias voltage ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig5](a ) ) . when increasing the polarization @xmath94 the contribution of spin - up states relative to the spin - down is increased resulting in an increase of tmr for the entire bias range",
    "however , the tmr changes in a non - linear manner : the tmr value at zero bias becomes larger than that at nonzero bias .",
    "this is because for a small bias graphene behaves as an insulator .",
    "in contrast , for a large bias graphene behaves more like a metal , which is an essential difference between graphene and other materials in the central region . the spin tunneling is ballistic through an insulator in contrast to a metal , whence the tmr is more enhanced around zero bias .",
    "there is almost no changes with the temperature @xmath97 for large bias ( see fig.[fig5 ] ( b ) ) . with increasing temperatures more thermally excited electrons",
    "contribute to the electrical currents for the parallel and the antiparallel configurations , in fact , the increase of the electrical current is faster for the antiparallel configuration .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the tmr decreases at higher temperatures and the zero - bias anomaly diminishes in this situation .",
    "the bias and the magnetic field dependencies of the differential conductance @xmath96 for the different temperature in the parallel configuration of magnetization is shown in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "@xmath96 versus the applied voltage exhibits an oscillating behaviour .",
    "each conductance peak corresponds to resonant transport through a landau level . as bias voltage increases , the distance between two neighboring peaks decreases due to the decrease of the distance between neighboring landau levels .",
    "the differential conductance oscillates as a function of the magnetic field , as shown in fig.[fig6 ] ( b ) .",
    "this is due to resonant transport through the landau levels at a particular magnetic field strength and the applied bias values . with increasing temperatures ( fig.[fig6](a ) ) the differential conductance deceases for all bias voltages . in particular , at zero bias the temperature dependence of the differential conductance is different from the magnetic field - free case .",
    "the explanation for this phenomena is as follows : the magnetic field lifts the insulator behavior at dirac point in graphene , and thus thermal fluctuations suppress the conductance .",
    "fig.[fig7 ] shows the tmr as a function of the bias voltage and the magnetic field strength for different polarizations p. tmr reaches a minimal value at bias voltages corresponding to the conductance peaks and increases with increasing @xmath94 which is nothing but a spin - valve effect .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the spin - dependent transport through a graphene spin valve device for a non - collinear configuration by means of keldysh s nonequilibrium green s function method .",
    "it is found that at a zero magnetic field , the current - voltage curves show a nonlinear behaviour .",
    "the corresponding differential conductance exhibits a strong dip near zero bias .",
    "the tmr shows a zero - bias anomaly that depends on the leads - spin polarization . increasing the bias tmr follows a behaviour akin to a metallic or an insulating system depending on the value of the bias . in the presence of an external magnetic field ,",
