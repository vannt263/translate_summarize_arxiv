    "it has been well known since the seminal works of sinai , ruelle , and bowen ( srb ) @xcite that the strongest chaotic systems ( smale s axiom a and anosov systems ) have srb measures with exponentially decaying mixing rates ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for these systems ,",
    "the difference between temporal and spatial averages is statistically described by a gaussian distribution ( the central limit theorem ) and the convergence of both averages towards a unique value is assured . on the other hand",
    ", there is a wide range of systems where mixing rates and other related correlation functions decay as power laws .",
    "such class of dynamical systems , dubbed weakly chaotic in the physics literature , typically exhibits weak statistical properties when compared with the chaotic ones .",
    "examples of weakly chaotic systems include maps with indifferent fixed points @xcite , billiards @xcite , and hamiltonian systems with sticky islands in phase space @xcite , among others .",
    "these systems have in common an intermittent dynamical behavior , exhibiting a transition from regular to chaotic regimes which has attracted the attention of physicists and mathematicians in the last 20 years .",
    "we recall that the so - called mixing rate of a pair of phase space observable functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 for maps of the type [ map ] x_t+1=f(x_t ) is defined as being the correlation function @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the invariant measure under the map @xmath4 .",
    "a map is said to be mixing if @xmath5 as @xmath6 for any pair of phase space smooth observables @xmath7 .    since correlation functions as the mixing rate ( [ mix ] ) might characterize the transition from strong to weak chaos , the attempt to relate them to more fundamental dynamical quantities is a goal that looks , at first glance , really promising . in ref .",
    "@xcite , for instance , the finite time lyapunov exponents [ lyap ] _",
    "t(x)=_k=0^t-1|f(f^k(x))| , were considered for one - dimensional maps like ( [ map ] ) for which @xmath8 , _",
    "i.e. _ , for strongly chaotic cases . essentially , they show that if there exist two positive constants @xmath9 and @xmath10 such that @xmath11 where @xmath12 stands for the distribution of finite time lyapunov exponents for the system in question , then we also have the following upper bound for the mixing rates @xmath13 of any pair of hlder continuous observables @xmath7 . in other words , they have proved rigorously that if the finite time lyapunov exponents tail probability is bounded by @xmath14 for large @xmath15 , then correlations will be also bounded asymptotically by @xmath16 .",
    "these important results have inspired a recent work @xcite in which a related conjecture is made for weakly chaotic systems , _",
    "i.e. _ , irrespective of having @xmath8 . the main results of @xcite can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "they argue that scrutinizing the way in which @xmath17 decays for large @xmath15 provides an `` extremely efficient way '' of studying quantitatively the decay of correlations .",
    "2 .   they conjecture , in view of recent results of @xcite , that the estimates of ( [ distlamb ] ) and ( [ corupp ] ) are not optimal , and the decay properties of @xmath17 and of @xmath18 should be , in fact , both polynomial with the same exponent .",
    "they check numerically such a conjecture for an one - dimensional intermittent map with two indifferent fixed points of the pomeau - manneville type @xcite , for which the polynomial decay rates of correlations are known exactly .",
    "two other types of two - dimensional intermittent maps are also numerically considered to support the conjecture .    here , we show that this conjecture is false by presenting an explicit class of counter - examples",
    ". we will consider a general class of pomeau - manneville maps @xcite and show that their lyapunov exponents tail probability ( [ distlamb ] ) decay faster than any power law , whereas their correlations ( [ mix ] ) do exhibit a power law decay .",
    "our approaches are firmly based on rigorous results , particularly on the aaronson - darling - kac theorem @xcite , and are also confirmed by exhaustive numerical simulations . for all maps in this class , correlation functions decay slowly than the lyapunov exponents tail probability , suggesting that bounds of the type ( [ distlamb ] ) and ( [ corupp ] ) can be physically relevant also for weakly chaotic systems .",
    "our counter - examples consist in a general class of pomeau - manneville ( pm ) intermittent dynamical systems of type ( [ map ] ) with @xmath19\\rightarrow[0,1]$ ] , where [ pmap ] f(x)~x(1+ax^z-1 ) for @xmath20 , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the global form of @xmath4 is irrelevant , provided it respects the axioms of an afn - system @xcite . for maps of the type ( [ pmap ] )",
    ", @xmath23 is an indifferent ( neutral ) fixed point , _ i.e. _ , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "such systems are known to have power law invariant measures near their indifferent fixed points .",
    "more specifically , we have @xmath26 , where @xmath27 near the fixed point @xmath23 , with @xmath28 @xcite . as consequence ,",
    "such systems have diverging invariant measure near this points for @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , finite invariant measure ( @xmath30 ) implies ergodicity and the usual lyapunov exponential instability , whereas the diverging case ( @xmath29 ) implies nonergodicity and subexponential instability .",
    "we will consider each of these cases separately and show that the conjecture proposed in @xcite fails for both .",
    "let us first consider the statistics of finite time lyapunov exponents ( [ lyap ] ) for randomly distributed initial conditions @xmath31 $ ] , in the case of finite invariant measure cases ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "it is well known that ergodicity properties can determine completely such statistics .",
    "for instance , birkhoff theorem @xcite states that , in an ergodic regime , the time average of an arbitrary observable function @xmath32 , @xmath33 , converges uniformly to the spatial average @xmath34 .",
    "then , for almost all initial conditions @xmath35 $ ] , the local expansion rate @xmath36 in ( [ lyap ] ) converges to the unique positive lyapunov exponent @xmath37 as @xmath38 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath15 is finite , @xmath36 assumes different values depending on the initial condition @xmath39 .",
    "the corresponding probability density function @xmath40 is given by [ plamb ] ( , t)=(_t(x)-)d(x ) .",
    "for large @xmath15 , @xmath41 takes the scaling form @xcite [ pesc ] ( , t)~(_,t ) , where @xmath42 is a concave function with minimum at @xmath43 .",
    "then we have @xmath44 and @xmath45 , with @xmath46 .",
    "now , a simple calculation by using laplace s method leads to [ mt0 ] m_t~ ( ) , where @xmath47 .",
    "the decaying properties of eq .",
    "( [ mt0 ] ) are definitively different than those ones predict by @xcite .",
    "in fact , one has [ mt1 ] m_t~ , for @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "it is important to stress that there are many rigorous results in the literature establishing polynomial bounds for the decay of correlations of pomeau - manneville maps in the regime @xmath30 , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "most notably , sarig @xcite and gouzel @xcite have achieved optimal polynomial bounds for such correlations in this regime .",
    "therefore , contrary to the conjecture proposed in @xcite , polynomial decay of correlations can occur simultaneously with exponential decay of lyapunov tail probability distributions .",
    "in fact , any conjecture stating that @xmath50 should decay as a power law is generically violated for ergodic regimes . for the pm map with @xmath30 ,",
    "this is indeed predicted by theorem 2 ( exponential level i result ) of @xcite .",
    "let us consider now the cases for which the invariant measure diverges locally at the indifferent fixed point @xmath23 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath29 .",
    "for such cases , the system typically exhibits a nonergodic behavior and , hence , time averages do not converge to a unique constant value .",
    "nevertheless , the aaronson - darling - kac ( adk ) theorem @xcite ensures that a suitable time - weighted average does converge uniformly in distribution terms towards a mittag - leffler distribution of unit first moment .",

    "i.e. _ , eq . ( [ mt1 ] ) .",
    "this shows that the way in which @xmath50 decays does not provide significant information on key aspects of weakly chaotic dynamics .",
    "in order to test and illustrate the conclusions of the last section , we perform an exhaustive numerical analysis of two particular afn - maps of the type ( [ pmap ] ) , namely the thaler map @xcite , defined for @xmath70 as @xmath71^{-1/(z-2 ) } , \\label{tmap}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] mod 1 , and the modified bernoulli map @xcite , defined also for @xmath29 as [ bern ] f(x ) = \\ {    ll x + 2^z-1x^z , & 0 x , + x - 2^z-1(1-x)^z , & < x 1 .    . the thaler map ( [ tmap ] ) is very convenient here because its invariant measure density is explicitly known , namely @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath28 , allowing in this way the explicit evaluation of the adk averages like ( [ lac ] ) .",
