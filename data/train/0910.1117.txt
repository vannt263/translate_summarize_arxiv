    "astrophysical flows are known to be turbulent and magnetized .",
    "the specific role played by mhd turbulence in different branches of astrophysics is still highly debated , but it is generally regarded as important . in particular , for the interstellar medium ( ism ) and star formation , the role of turbulence has been discussed in many reviews ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the opinion on the role of magnetic field in these environments vary from magnetic field being regarded as absolutely dominant in the processes ( see @xcite ) to moderately important , as in super - alfvnic models of star formation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the vital question that frequently permeates these debates is the diffusion of the magnetic field in astrophysical fluids .",
    "the conductivity of most of the astrophysical fluids is high enough to make the ohmic diffusion negligible on the scales involved , which means that the `` frozen - in '' approximation is a good one for many astrophysical environments .",
    "however , without considering diffusive mechanisms that can violate the flux freezing , one faces problems attempting to explain many observational facts .",
    "for example , simple estimates show that if all the magnetic flux is brought together with the material that collapses to form a star in molecular clouds , then the magnetic field in a proto - star should be several orders of magnitude higher than the one observed in t - tauri stars ( this is the `` magnetic flux problem '' , see @xcite and references therein , for example ) .",
    "to address the problem of the magnetic field diffusion both in the partially ionized ism and in molecular clouds , researchers usually appeal to the ambipolar diffusion concept ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the idea of the ambipolar diffusion is very simple and may be easily exemplified in the case of gas collapsing to form a protostar .",
    "as the magnetic field is acting on charged particles only , it does not directly affect neutrals .",
    "neutrals move under the gravitational pull but are scattered by collisions with ions and charged dust grains which are coupled with the magnetic field .",
    "the resulting flow dominated by the neutrals will be unable to drag the magnetic field lines and these will diffuse away through the infalling matter . this process of ambipolar diffusion becomes faster as the ionization ratio decreases and therefore , becomes more important in poorly ionized cloud cores .",
    "@xcite have explored the accretion phase in low - mass star formation and concluded that there should exist an effective diffusivity about 4 orders of magnitude larger than ohmic diffusivity in order to an efficient magnetic flux transport to occur .",
    "they have argued that ambipolar diffusion could work , but only under rather special circumstances like , for instance , considering particular dust grain sizes . in other words , at the moment it is unclear if ambipolar diffusion is really high enough to solve the magnetic flux transport problem in collapsing flows .",
    "does magnetic field remain absolutely frozen - in within highly ionized astrophysical fluids ?",
    "the answer to this question affects the description of numerous essential processes in the interstellar and intergalactic gas .",
    "magnetic reconnection was appealed in @xcite as a way of removing magnetic flux from gravitating clouds , e.g. from star - forming clouds .",
    "that work referred to the reconnection model of @xcite and @xcite for the justification of the concept of fast magnetic reconnection in the presence of turbulence .",
    "the advantage of the scheme proposed by @xcite was that robust removal of magnetic flux can be accomplished both in partially and fully ionized plasma , with only marginal dependence on the ionization state of the gas .",
    "the concept of `` reconnection diffusion '' introduced in @xcite is relevant to our understanding of many basic astrophysical processes . in particular",
    ", it suggests that the classical textbook description of molecular clouds supported both by hourglass magnetic field and turbulence is not self - consistent .",
    "indeed , turbulence is expected to induce `` reconnection diffusion '' which should enable fast magnetic field removal from the cloud . however , in the absence of numerical confirmation of the fast reconnection , the scheme of magnetic flux removal through `` reconnection diffusion '' as opposed to ambipolar diffusion stayed somewhat speculative .",
    "fortunately , it has been recently shown numerically ( see @xcite ) that three - dimensional magnetic reconnection in turbulent fluid follows the predictions of the reconnection model of @xcite and therefore , is fast .",
    "this naturally increased the interest to the `` reconnection diffusion '' ( see @xcite ) .",
    "motivated by this fact , here we perform simulations aiming to gain understanding of the diffusion of magnetic field induced by turbulence . as @xcite tested magnetic reconnection in fully ionized gas in the present paper we shall focus our efforts on one fluid mhd simulations .",
    "we shall compare `` reconnection diffusion '' with the ambipolar diffusion and discuss the effects of ambipolar diffusion qualitatively focusing on the comparison of our results on `` reconnection diffusion '' with those on `` ambipolar turbulent diffusion '' described in @xcite .",
    "the latter study reported the enhancement of ambipolar diffusion in the presence of turbulence , which raised the question of how important is the simultaneous action of turbulence and ambipolar diffusion and whether turbulence alone , i.e. without any effect from ambipolar diffusion , can equally well induce de - correlation of magnetic field and density .    our work on `` reconnection diffusion '' should also be distinguished from the research on the de - correlation of magnetic field and density within compressible turbulent fluctuations .",
    "@xcite performed three - dimensional mhd simulations and reported the existence of separate turbulent cascades of alfvn and fast modes in strongly driven turbulence as well as a cascade of slow modes driven by alfvnic cascade .",
    "slow modes in magnetically dominated plasma are associated with density perturbations with marginal perturbation of magnetic fields , while the same is true for fast modes in weakly magnetized or high beta plasmas . naturally , these two modes de - correlate magnetic fields and density on the crossing time of the wave .",
    "this was the effect studied in more detail in one - dimensional both analytically and numerically by @xcite , who stressed that the enhancements of magnetic field strength and density may correlate and anti - correlate in turbulent interstellar gas within the fluctuations and this can introduce the dispersion of the mass - to - flux ratios within the turbulent volume .",
    "each of the fluctuations provide a _ transient _ change of the pointwise magnetization . in the absence of other effects , e.g. related to the thermal instability ,",
    "the de - correlation is reversible . in comparison ,",
    "the `` reconnection diffusion '' , similar to the ambipolar diffusion , deals with the _ permanent _ de - correlation of magnetic field and density . acting alone ,",
    "the `` reconnection diffusion '' increases entropy making magnetic field - density de - correlation irreversible .",
    "what are the laws that govern _ magnetic field diffusion _ in turbulent magnetized fluids ? could those affect our understanding of basic interstellar and star formation processes ?",
    "these are the questions that we address in this paper .    in this study",
    ", we try to understand the diffusion of magnetic field in a couple of idealized models in the presence of turbulence .",
    "we explore setups both with and without gravity and compare the diffusion of magnetic field with that of a passive scalar . in the context of star formation an important issue that we will address is an alternative way of decreasing the magnetic flux - to - mass ratio without appealing to ambipolar diffusion .",
    "we claim that since turbulence in astrophysics is really ubiquitous , our results should be widely applicable .",
    "we also perform simulations including turbulent heat diffusion , which allow us to compare results obtained with our code with those in the literature .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we draw the theoretical grounds about fast magnetic reconnection . in section 3",
    ", we describe the numerical code employed . in section 4 , we present the results concerning the diffusion of magnetic field in a setup without external gravitational forces . in section 5 , we present the results of our experiments of diffusion of magnetic field in the presence of a gravitational field . in section 6 , we discuss our results and compare with previous works . in section 7",
    ", we discuss the accomplishments and limitations of our present study . in section 8",
    ", we discuss our findings in the context of strong turbulence theory , and finally in section 9 , we summarize our conclusions . while our work is focused on the diffusion of magnetic fields , we address in the appendix the heat transport in magnetized turbulent plasma .",
    "we confirm with higher resolution the results in @xcite that the heat advection within turbulent flows in the presence of magnetic fields is very similar to that induced by hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "the dynamical response of magnetic fields in turbulent fluids , as we discussed above , depends on the ability of magnetic fields to change their topology via reconnection .",
    "we know from observations that magnetic field reconnection may be both fast and slow .",
    "indeed , a slow phase of reconnection is necessary in order to explain the accumulation of free energy associated with the magnetic flux that precedes eruptive flares in magnetized coronae .",
    "thus it is important to identify the conditions for the reconnection to be fast .",
    "different mechanisms prescribe different necessary requirements for this to happen .",
    "the problem of magnetic reconnection is most frequently discussed in terms of solar flares . however ,",
    "this is a general basic process underlying the dynamics of magnetized fluids in general .",
    "if the magnetic field lines in a turbulent fluid do not easily reconnect , the properties of the fluid should be dominated by intersecting magnetic flux tubes which are unable to pass through each other .",
    "such fluids can not be simulated with the existing codes as magnetic flux tubes readily reconnect in the numerical simulations which are currently very diffusive compared to the actual astrophysical flows .    the famous sweet - parker model of reconnection ( @xcite ; see figure  [ recon1 ] , upper panel ) produces reconnection rates which are smaller than the alfvn velocity by a square root of the lundquist number , i.e. by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 in this case is the length of the current sheet .",
    "astrophysical values of @xmath2 can be as large as @xmath3 or @xmath4 , thus this scheme produces reconnection at a rate which is negligible for most of the astrophysical circumstances .",
    "if the sweet  parker were proven to be the only possible model of reconnection , it would have been possible to show that mhd numerical simulations do not have anything to do with real astrophysical fluids .",
    "fortunately , faster schemes of reconnection are available .",
    "the first model of fast reconnection proposed by @xcite assumed that magnetic fluxes get into contact not along the astrophysically large scales of @xmath1 , but instead over a scale comparable to the resistive thickness @xmath5 , forming a distinct x - point , where magnetic field lines of the interacting fluxes converge at a sharp point to the reconnection spot .",
    "the stability of such a reconnection geometry in astrophysical situations is an open issue .",
    "at least for uniform resistivity , this configuration was proven to be unstable and to revert to a sweet  parker configuration @xcite .",
    "recent years have been marked by the progress in understanding some of the key processes of reconnection in astrophysical plasmas .",
    "in particular , a substantial progress has been obtained by considering reconnection in the presence of the hall - effect @xcite .",
    "the condition for which the hall - mhd term becomes important for the reconnection is that the ion skin depth @xmath6 becomes comparable with the sweet - parker diffusion scale @xmath7 .",
    "the ion skin depth is a microscopic characteristic and it can be viewed as the gyroradius of an ion moving at the alfvn speed , i.e. @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the cyclotron frequency of an ion . for the parameters of the ism ( see table  1 in @xcite ) ,",
    "the reconnection is collisional ( see further discussion in @xcite ) .    to deal with both collisional and collisionless plasma (",
    "* henceforth lv99 ) proposed a model of fast reconnection in the presence of weak turbulence when magnetic field back - reaction is extremely important .",
    "we stress that the lv99 model does not assume that the magnetic field can be easily bent by fluid motions , which is a usual assumption to `` justify '' the _ erroneous _ concept of turbulent diffusivity in the mean field dynamo .",
    "the middle and bottom panels of figure  [ recon1 ] illustrate the key components of lv99 model is an idealization of the reconnection process as the actual reconnection region also includes reconnected open loops of magnetic field moving oppositely to each other .",
    "nevertheless , the cartoon properly reflects the role of the three - dimensionality of the reconnection process , the importance of small - scale reconnection events , and the increase of the outflow region compared to the sweet  parker scheme . ] .",
    "the reconnection events happen on small scales @xmath10 where magnetic field lines get into contact .",
    "as the number of independent reconnection events that take place simultaneously is @xmath11 the resulting reconnection speed is not limited by the speed of individual events on the scale @xmath10 . instead , the constraint on the reconnection speed comes from the thickness of the outflow reconnection region @xmath12 , which is determined by the magnetic field wandering in a turbulent fluid .",
    "the model is intrinsically three dimensional as both field wandering and simultaneous entry of many independent field patches , as shown in figure  [ recon1 ] , are three - dimensional effects . in lv99 model",
    "the magnetic reconnection speed becomes comparable with @xmath13 when the scale of magnetic field wandering @xmath12 becomes comparable with @xmath1 .",
    "for a quantitative description of the reconnection , one should adopt a model of mhd turbulence ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the most important for magnetic field wandering is the alfvnic component . adopting the ( * ? ?",
    "* henceforth gs95 ) scaling of the alfvnic component of mhd turbulence extended to include the case of weak turbulence , lv99 predicted that the reconnection speed in a weakly turbulent magnetic field is @xmath14 where the level of turbulence",
    "is parameterized by the injection velocity ; the combination @xmath15 is the velocity of the largest strong turbulence eddies @xmath16 , i.e. , the velocity at the scale at which the alfvnic turbulence transfers from the weak to the strong regimes .",
    "thus equation  ( [ recon ] ) can also be rewritten as @xmath17 ; @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the turbulence injection scale .",
    "the scaling predictions given by equation  ( [ recon ] ) have been tested successfully by three - dimensional mhd numerical simulations in @xcite .",
    "this stimulates us to adopt the lv99 model as a starting point for our discussion of magnetic reconnection",
    ".    how can @xmath10 be determined ?",
    "in lv99 model , as many as @xmath20 localized reconnection events take place , each of which reconnects the flux at the rate @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the velocity of local reconnection events at the scale @xmath10 .",
    "the individual reconnection events contribute to the global reconnection rate , which in three dimensions becomes a factor of @xmath23 larger , i.e. , @xmath24    the local reconnection speed , conservatively assuming that the local events are happening at the sweet ",
    "parker rate , can be easily obtained by identifying the local resistive region @xmath7 with @xmath25 and using the relations between @xmath10 and @xmath25 that follow from the mhd turbulence model .",
    "the corresponding calculations in lv99 provided the local reconnection rate @xmath26 .",
    "substituting this local reconnection rate in equation  ( [ global ] ) one estimates the global reconnection speed , _ if this speed were limited by ohmic resistivity _ , which is larger than @xmath13 by a factor @xmath27 .",
    "as a result , one has to conclude that the reconnection does not depend on resistivity .",
    "the lv99 model is applicable to situations when plasma effects are included , e.g. the hall - mhd effect , which increases effective resistivities for local reconnection events .",
    "while the latter point is difficult to test directly with existing plasma codes , e.g. , with pic codes , due to the necessity of simulating both plasma microphysics effects as well as macrophysical effects of magnetic turbulence , @xcite simulated the action of plasma effects by parameterizing them via anomalous resistivities .",
    "the values of such resistivities are a steep function of the separation between oppositely directed magnetic field lines , which also determines the current separating magnetic fluxes .",
    "with anomalous resistivities , the structure of the fractal current sheet of the turbulent reconnection changed substantially , but no significant changes of the reconnection rate were reported , which agrees well with the theoretical expectations of lv99 . within the model the explanation of this stems from the fact that the reconnection is already fast ( i.e. , independent of resistivity ) even when small - scale reconnection events are mediated by the ohmic resistivity , while the bottleneck for the reconnection process is provided by magnetic field wandering .",
    "thus the increase of the local reconnection rate does not increase the global reconnection speed .    in this work ,",
    "we address the problems which are relevant to the reconnection in a partially ionized , weakly turbulent gas . the corresponding model of reconnection",
    "was proposed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth lvc04 ) .",
    "the extensive calculations summarized in table 1 in lvc04 show that the reconnection for realistic circumstances varies from @xmath28 to @xmath29 , i.e. , is also fast , which should enable fast diffusion arising from turbulent motions .",
    "the fact that magnetic fields reconnect fast in turbulent fluids ensures that the large - scale dynamics that we can reproduce well with numerical codes is not compromised by the difference in reconnection processes in the computer and in astrophysical flows .",
    "this motivates our present study in which we investigate diffusion processes in turbulent magnetized fluids via three - dimensional simulations .",
    "we feel that the issue of the dimension of the simulations is crucial for the turbulence dynamics and the reconnection and , as a result , for our final results .",
    "visualization of turbulent diffusion of heat or any passive scalar field is easy within the gs95 model , which can be interpreted as a model of kolmogorov cascade perpendicular to the local direction of the magnetic field ( lv99 and more discussion in section 8) .",
    "the corresponding eddies are expected to advect heat similarly to the case of the hydrodynamic heat advection ( see appendix a )",
    ". the corresponding visualization of the magnetic field diffusion is more involved .",
    "every time that magnetic field lines intersect each other , they change their configuration draining free energy from the system . in the presence of self - gravity",
    "this may mean the escape of magnetic field , which is a `` light fluid '' from the self - gravitating gaseous `` heavy fluid '' .",
    "naturally , if the turbulence gets very strong the system gets unbound and then the mixing of magnetic field and gas , rather than their segregation is expected . in what follows we test these ideas numerically .",
    "the systems studied numerically in this work is described by the resistive mhd equations , assuming an isothermal equation of state :    @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32    plus the divergenceless condition for the magnetic field @xmath33 .",
    "the spatial coordinates are given in units of a typical length @xmath34 .",
    "the density @xmath35 is normalized by a reference density @xmath36 , and the velocity field @xmath37 by a reference velocity @xmath38 .",
    "the constant sound speed @xmath39 is also given in units of @xmath38 , and the magnetic field @xmath40 is measured in units of @xmath41 .",
    "the uniform ohmic resistivity @xmath42 is given in units of @xmath43 . in our numerical calculations we will use both non - zero and zero values of @xmath44 . in the latter case , the calculations will include only numerical resistivity .",
    "time @xmath45 is measured in units of @xmath46 .",
    "the external gravitational potential @xmath47 is given in units of @xmath48 .",
    "the source term @xmath49 is a random force term responsible for injection of turbulence .",
    "the above equations are solved inside a three - dimensional box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we use a shock - capturing godunov - type scheme with an hll solver ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "time integration is performed with the runge - kutta method of second order . unless we say explicitly the opposite , we assume @xmath50 .    we employ an isotropic , non - helical , solenoidal , delta correlated in time forcing @xmath49 . this forcing acts in a thin shell around the wave number @xmath51 , that is , the scale of turbulence injection @xmath52 that is about @xmath53 times smaller than the box size @xmath54 ( in all the simulations , we choose @xmath55 in code units ) . in",
    "most of the experiments , the @xmath56 velocity @xmath57 induced by turbulence in the box is close to unity ( in code units ) .",
    "therefore , in these cases , the turnover time of the energy - carrying eddies ( or the turbulent timescale @xmath58 ) is @xmath59 units of time in code units .",
    "we note that for our present purposes we use an one - fluid approximation , which does not include ambipolar diffusion .",
    "this choice is appropriate for approximating a fully ionized gas .",
    "one may argue that the code describes also the dynamics of partially ionized gas , but on the scales where ions and neutrals are strongly coupled , i.e , . on scales larger than the scale of ambipolar diffusion ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "observations of different regions of the diffuse ism compiled by @xcite indicate that magnetic fields and density are not straightforwardly correlated .",
    "these observations motivated @xcite to perform 2.5-dimensional numerical calculations in the presence of both ambipolar diffusion and turbulence .",
    "the results in @xcite also indicated de - correlation of magnetic field and density and one may wonder whether ambipolar diffusion is always required to de - correlate magnetic field and density or if , otherwise , to what extent the concept of `` turbulent ambipolar diffusion '' introduced in @xcite is useful ( see also @xcite ) . to address these issues we performed three - dimensional simulations of magnetic diffusion in the absence of ambipolar diffusion effects .",
    "the magnetic field is assumed to have initially only the component in the @xmath60-direction .",
    "the initial configuration of the magnetic and density fields are :    @xmath61    @xmath62 ^{2 } \\right\\rbrace \\text{,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath63 is the center of the @xmath64-plane .",
    "boundary conditions are periodic .",
    "this initial magnetic field configuration has an uniform component @xmath65 plus an harmonic perturbation of amplitude @xmath66 .",
    "the density field is distributed in such a way that the gas pressure , given by the isothermal equation of state @xmath67 , equilibrates exactly the magnetic pressure , giving a magneto - hydrostatic solution .",
    "we choose the parameters @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 in all our simulations .",
    "figure [ fig : heitsch_ilu1 ] illustrates these initial fields when @xmath71 .",
    "we should remark that the simulations presented in @xcite do not start at the equilibrium , like ours .",
    "there is no pressure term in their equation for the evolution of the momentum of the ions to counterbalance the magnetic pressure . in addition , in their work the ion - density field is kept constant in time and space .",
    "another difference between our setup and that in @xcite is that our parameter @xmath66 is assumed to be the same for all the models studied , and not a fraction of @xmath65 . also , the amplitude of the perturbation of the homogeneous component of the density field is a free parameter in @xcite , while here it is constrained by the imposed equilibrium between gas and magnetic pressures .",
    "in addition , we introduce a passive scalar field @xmath72 initially identical to @xmath73 .",
    "the parameters of our relevant simulations are presented in table [ tab : heitsch2 ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : diffusion1 ]      compressibility can change the properties of flows substantially .",
    "for instance , high mach number turbulence is known to create regions of enhanced density which will coexist with the expanses of low density .",
    "at the same time , one should expect to see similarity between the properties of fluid in low - mach number flows and incompressible flows .",
    "we first consider a case of heat transport , which can be considered as a test case , as we can compare our results with the earlier heat transport simulations in @xcite .",
    "this is the case where the back - reaction can be ignored and we can use a passive scalar diffusion to represent the diffusion of heat .    let us relate the evolution of the dispersion @xmath74 with the turbulent diffusion coefficient @xmath75 , that is , the coefficient that gives the rate at which the passive scalar field diffuses in scales larger than the turbulent scale .",
    "the dispersion @xmath74 is calculated through the definition : @xmath76 , where @xmath77 .",
    "if @xmath78 is the @xmath56 distance between two fluid elements being advected , for @xmath78 higher than the injection scale of the turbulence @xmath52 , its evolution is related to @xmath75 by @xmath79 .",
    "considering ordinary hydrodynamic turbulence , we can write , for the @xmath56 distance @xmath19 between two fluid elements , within the inertial range , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the velocity at scale @xmath19 . from the assumption that both relations above should be valid at the scale @xmath52",
    ", it must be true that @xmath82 , and we could define a constant @xmath83 so that : @xmath84    now , one wonder if @xmath83 is reduced by the magnetic field in magnetized turbulence ( due to suppression of turbulent mixture ) .",
    "@xmath83 is related to the constant of proportionality in equation ( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "again , let @xmath19 be the distance between two fluid elements initially separated by a distance @xmath85 within the inertial range in ordinary hydrodynamic turbulence . repeating equation ( [ 11 ] ) and using the kolmogorov s phenomenology , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the power of injection ( or dissipation ) of the kinetic energy . integrating the last expression , @xmath88 where the dimensionless constant @xmath89 is the richardson constant @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath83 is related to @xmath89 .    using the dispersion @xmath74 of our experiments as the @xmath56 distance @xmath19 in the equation ( a6 ) , and supposing that this equation remains valid in mhd turbulence , @xmath90 where @xmath91 has not necessarily the same value as that of @xmath89 .",
    "figure [ fig : diffusion2 ] shows the evolution of @xmath92 for our models .",
    "we have made an offset of the values for each model in order to make the visualization easier .",
    "table [ tab : diffusion1 ] lists the approximated values of @xmath91 for the models , obtained from a linear fit of the data .",
    "all in all , our results presented in figure [ fig : diffusion2 ] are consistent with the scalings of diffusion shown in @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the relation ( [ 12 ] ) continues approximately valid in the mhd case .",
    "the slopes do not seem to be very sensitive to @xmath93 , but we can note a small difference for the trans - alfvnic and super - alfvnic cases , the constant @xmath91 being a little higher in the super - alfvnic cases .",
    "this finding is consistent with the prediction of changes of the diffusion efficiencies of @xcite .",
    "there it is shown that for higher magnetization , corresponding to an alfvn mach number @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the injection velocity and @xmath13 is the alfvnic velocity , the turbulence at the large scales is weak , which produces weak mixing . in our parameterization",
    "this corresponds to the decrease of @xmath91 , which is the case of a2 simulation .",
    "interestingly enough , in the case of @xmath96 and @xmath97 , which is the case of a4 simulation , we see the increase of @xmath91 .",
    "the case of high mach number turbulence is not covered by @xcite , but we expect that the concentration of gas in dense regions plays an important role for the effect . in regions of gas concentration the alfvnic velocity drops and the corresponding @xmath98 increases ( see @xcite ) . as a result , the mixing should be less constrained by the magnetic field as we see in the a4 model .",
    "comparing cases a1 and a3 we observe that for super - alfvnic turbulence and different mach number @xmath99 the diffusivity is rather similar .",
    "note that @xcite obtained the values of @xmath100 ( @xmath101 and @xmath102 ) , @xmath103 ( @xmath104 and @xmath102 ) , @xmath105 ( @xmath104 and @xmath106 ) , and @xmath107 ( hydrodynamic case and @xmath106 ) , which are consistent with our findings . in @xcite , @xmath108 in all the cases ( to make a comparison we had to convert the time - scale to the present code units , i.e. 1 time step here = 2@xmath109 time steps there ) .",
    "we conclude that , for a wide range of magnetizations and mach numbers , turbulence is efficient in inducing turbulent diffusivity of heat .",
    "our results show that the turbulent diffusivity of passive scalar fields @xmath75 is well described by @xmath110 , similar to the hydrodynamic case , and that the coefficient @xmath91 is not very sensitive to the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field does not impose a strong suppression of the turbulent diffusion perpendicular to it as far as heat transfer is concerned .    as already pointed in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , the effectiveness of the turbulent diffusion has important consequences on the thermal diffusion in the ism and intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "the nearly isotropic turbulent diffusivity can be 1 order of magnitude higher in the gas of central regions of galaxy clusters , like the hydra a cluster , compared to the _ spitzer _ value , based on the kinetic theory . in the ism , in mixing layers , where turbulence is very strong",
    ", the turbulent diffusivity can be 2 orders of magnitude higher than the laminar values ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our results extend the range of the applicability of the turbulent heat advection model of @xcite .",
    "in our simulations described in section 4 ( see table [ tab : heitsch2 ] ) we also keep track of passive scalar field representative either of heat or passive impurity .",
    "figure [ fig : heitsch8 ] ( left panels ) shows the time evolution of @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "both quantities have a similar behavior , and all models seem to achieve the characteristic average values ( @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) roughly at the same time .",
    "right plot of figure [ fig : heitsch8 ] is an analog of figure [ fig : heitsch8b ] .",
    "a comparison between these figures reinforces that the quantity @xmath115 evolves similar to @xmath116 .",
    "how can we understand this behavior ?    using the expression @xmath117",
    "one gets @xmath118 , when @xmath119 is accounted for . using the continuity equation in the form",
    "@xmath120 one can get @xmath121 which coincides with equation [ eqn : continuity_heat ] if @xmath122 is substituted by @xmath123 .",
    "figure [ fig : heitsch11b ] ( left panels ) shows the distribution of @xmath124 versus @xmath125 for the model b2 ( @xmath71 , see table [ tab : heitsch2 ] ) at different time steps ( @xmath126 , @xmath127 ) .",

    "<S> the diffusion of astrophysical magnetic fields in conducting fluids in the presence of turbulence depends on whether magnetic fields can change their topology via reconnection in highly conducting media . </S>",
    "<S> recent progress in understanding fast magnetic reconnection in the presence of turbulence is reassuring that the magnetic field behavior in computer simulations and turbulent astrophysical environments is similar , as far as magnetic reconnection is concerned . </S>",
    "<S> this makes it meaningful to perform mhd simulations of turbulent flows in order to understand the diffusion of magnetic field in astrophysical environments . </S>",
    "<S> our studies of magnetic field diffusion in turbulent medium reveal interesting new phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , our three - dimensional mhd simulations initiated with anti - correlating magnetic field and gaseous density exhibit at later times a de - correlation of the magnetic field and density , which corresponds well to the observations of the interstellar media . while earlier studies stressed the role of either ambipolar diffusion or time - dependent turbulent fluctuations for de - correlating magnetic field and density , we get the effect of _ permanent _ de - correlation with one fluid code , i.e. without invoking ambipolar diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , in the presence of gravity and turbulence , our three - dimensional simulations show the decrease of the magnetic flux - to - mass ratio as the gaseous density at the center of the gravitational potential increases . </S>",
    "<S> we observe this effect both in the situations when we start with equilibrium distributions of gas and magnetic field and when we follow the evolution of collapsing dynamically unstable configurations . </S>",
    "<S> thus the process of turbulent magnetic field removal should be applicable both to quasi - static subcritical molecular clouds and cores and violently collapsing supercritical entities . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of the gravitational potential as well as the magnetization of the gas increases the segregation of the mass and magnetic flux in the saturated final state of the simulations , supporting the notion that the reconnection - enabled diffusivity relaxes the magnetic field + gas system in the gravitational field to its minimal energy state . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is expected to play an important role in star formation , from its initial stages of concentrating interstellar gas to the final stages of the accretion to the forming protostar . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we benchmark our codes by studying the heat transfer in magnetized compressible fluids and confirm the high rates of turbulent advection of heat obtained in an earlier study . </S>"
