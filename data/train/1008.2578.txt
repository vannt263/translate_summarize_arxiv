    "in discussions of f - term @xmath1 supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking , r - symmetry plays a crucial role .",
    "importance of a u(1 ) r - symmetry in spontaneous susy breaking was clearly addressed in ref .",
    "it was shown that , `` a continuous r - symmetry is a necessary condition for spontaneous supersymmetry breaking and a spontaneously broken r - symmetry is a sufficient condition , in models where the gauge dynamics can be integrated out and in which the effective superpotential is a generic function consistent with the symmetries of the theory . ''",
    "however , in this paper , we are going to show that there exist a large number of generic and renormalizable wess - zumino(wz ) models where existence of a @xmath0 r - symmetry is sufficient to break susy spontaneously .",
    "it is well known that if there is no r - symmetry , continuous or discrete , in wz models with canonical khler potentials , then the global minima preserve susy  @xcite . with the help of the above two results we can conclude that existence of a @xmath0 r - symmetry is a necessary condition for breaking in a global minimum for generic and renormalizable wz models .",
    "models of f - term susy breaking with a @xmath0 r - symmetry can be obtained most simply from the models of f - term susy breaking with u(1 ) r - symmetry by adding a completely different and decoupled sector to break u(1 ) r - symmetry explicitly down to a @xmath0 r - symmetry . in sec  [",
    "s : deformor ] , we illustrate this idea by adding some more terms to the famous oraifeartaigh  @xcite ( or ) model",
    ". however these models are trivial . in sec .",
    "[ s : nontrivial ] , we explicitly discuss a non - trivial model where the superpotential can not be broken into such two non - interacting parts . we have also shown that this model has a vacuum where susy as well as discrete r - symmetry is spontaneously broken for large regions of parameter space .",
    "we then give some variations of this model by adding more fields . in sec .",
    "[ s : serises ] , we identify the form of these models , and then , three series of models are given where each series contains a large number of such models .",
    "a note about notations . for u(1 )",
    "r - symmetry we use @xmath2 to denote the u(1 ) r - charge of any chiral scalar superfield @xmath3 in the normalization where the r - charge of @xmath4 is 1 .",
    "we use @xmath5 to denote @xmath0 r - charge of the superspace co - ordinate @xmath4",
    ". discrete r - charge of pseudo - moduli superfield @xmath6 is @xmath7 and that of any other superfield is just the subscript of that field .",
    "adding a completely different and decoupled sector to any one of f - term susy breaking models with u(1 ) r - symmetry ( we will call it as old sector ) , we can break u(1 ) r - symmetry to a @xmath0 r - symmetry explicitly .",
    "value of @xmath8 is controlled by the new sector .",
    "if we find a new sector ( or in other words , a @xmath0 r - symmetry ) for which no new term to the old sector is allowed even though r - symmetry becomes weaker , then susy breaking conditions coming from the old sector will not alter . in this way , we get models of f - term susy breaking with a discrete r - symmetry in generic theories .    to illustrate our idea , we consider the famous or model as an example of the old sector : @xmath9 the above superpotential is generic with a u(1 ) r - symmetry where @xmath10 and a @xmath11 internal symmetry under which @xmath6 transforms trivially whereas @xmath3 s transform non - trivially .",
    "let s now add five new fields @xmath12 to the old sector and get the following superpotential .",
    "@xmath13 this superpotential does not have a u(1 ) r - symmetry , as can be easily checked .",
    "however , spontaneous susy breaking still occurs because the f - terms , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are not changed due to the inclusion of the new terms .",
    "the above superpotential is generic with the following three symmetries .    1 .   a @xmath16 r - symmetry with @xmath17 .",
    "2 .   a @xmath11 internal symmetry under which all the @xmath18 s transform non - trivially whereas @xmath6 and @xmath19 s transform trivially .",
    "3 .   a @xmath20 internal symmetry under which all the @xmath19 s transform as @xmath21 whereas the remaining fields are invariant .    we can get different variations of the above model easily , for a @xmath0 r - symmetry with @xmath22 and @xmath17 as follows .",
    "@xmath23 where @xmath24 when @xmath25 .",
    "thus we have proved that there exists a large number of generic ( trivial ) models where existence of a @xmath0 r - symmetry is sufficient to break susy via f - terms .",
    "one can also use this technique to other susy breaking models @xcite with @xmath26 r - symmetry .",
    "one side comment about these models .",
    "old and new sectors of any one of these models can communicate to each other through gauge interactions if we gauge some of the internal symmetries .",
    "for example , we can easily promote the fields @xmath3 and @xmath27 to transform under adjoint representation and promote the field @xmath6 to remain invariant under a gauge group , without forbidding any term of the old and new sectors .",
    "however , these models will then no longer be wz models",
    ".    now , we can ask whether it is possible to construct generic f - term susy breaking models with the following charateristics : ( @xmath28 ) there is no u(1 ) r - symmetry in the superpotential ; ( @xmath29 ) the superpotential can not be subdivided into two disjoint sectors / parts . in the rest of the paper , we show examples of models with all these characteristics .",
    "we consider a renormalizable wz model with @xmath30 r - symmetry and @xmath31 .",
    "we also consider that other than @xmath6 , there are @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 fields in the theory .",
    "so we will have the following generic superpotential .",
    "@xmath39 where , without loss of generality we can take all the parameters , except @xmath40 , to be real and positive .",
    "the above superpotential does not have a u(1 ) r - symmetry . with @xmath41 ,",
    "there is a u(1 ) r - symmetry with the following r - charge assignments .",
    "@xmath42 but then the superpotential is not generic . for @xmath43 , this u(1 )",
    "r - symmetry is explicitly broken .",
    "there is spontaneous susy breaking .",
    "this can be easily realized by observing the following f - terms , @xmath44 notice that vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of @xmath14 and @xmath45 terms can not be simultaneously zero .",
    "we can vanish all other f - terms for any value of @xmath46 ( vev of @xmath38 ) by choosing appropriate vevs of other fields .",
    "now minimum of scalar potential depends on @xmath46 . like the oraifeartaigh model @xcite we have two cases , ( a )  for @xmath47 ,",
    "minimum is at @xmath48 , whereas ( b )  for @xmath49 , minimum is at @xmath50 .",
    "hence we have a vacuum where supersymmetry as well as discrete r - symmetry get spontaneously broken .",
    "tree level scalar potentials of susy breaking often have flat directions @xcite .",
    "for example , for the case of @xmath51 , minimum of tree level potential is independent of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "so , it is necessary to calculate 1-loop correction to check whether these flat directions are lifted or not .",
    "one loop correction is given by coleman - weinberg ( cw ) @xcite potential , @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are mass matrices for scalar and fermion fields .",
    "non - zero eigenvalues @xmath57 and @xmath58 of @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively for @xmath51 are follows .",
    "@xmath61 where @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 denote @xmath65 .",
    "putting these eigenvalues to and expanding @xmath66 about @xmath67 , we find @xmath68 constants @xmath69 and @xmath70 are positive and hence after addition of 1-loop correction , total scalar potential have a local minimum at @xmath71 .",
    "we can get different variations of the above model by adding more @xmath3 fields in the theory .",
    "for example , we can add any number of fields from the list @xmath72 . in this way",
    "we get 31 more models .",
    "if we add all the fields from the list , then the superpotential takes the following form @xmath73 note that addition of these fields do not change @xmath74 and @xmath75 and hence there is susy breaking .",
    "in this section we are going to show that there exists a large number of non - trivial models where existence of a discrete r - symmetry is sufficient to break supersymmetry .",
    "we consider the superpotentials are of the following form with a @xmath76 r - symmetry and @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath78 where @xmath79 are natural numbers , @xmath80 contains cubic terms which are independent of @xmath81 , and @xmath82 denotes quadratic terms for @xmath3 fields other than @xmath83 fields .",
    "note that the superpotentials of the previous section are of the above form with @xmath84 and @xmath85 . due to this form of superpotentials ,",
    "susy gets spontaneously broken .",
    "one can show this by observing the following f - terms @xmath86 above equations are the same as for @xmath84 and @xmath85 .      in this series of models",
    "@xmath87 is multiple of four and @xmath85 i.e. superpotentials have a @xmath88 r - symmetry with @xmath89 .",
    "field content of this series for any @xmath87 is given below .",
    "@xmath90 note that the model with @xmath84 have the same r - symmetry and @xmath5 as the models given in the previous section .",
    "but this model is different from those models because it has different field content .",
    "to show that there is no u(1 ) r - symmetry in this series of models , we use method of contradiction .",
    "if there were a u(1 ) r - symmetry in any model , existence of terms @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 would imply that @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 . from the terms",
