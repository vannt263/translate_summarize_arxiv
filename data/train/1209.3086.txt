    "it has long been noticed that according to newton s inverse - square law of gravity , the observed baryonic matter can not provide enough force to attract the matter of the galaxies @xcite .",
    "this inconsistency has been confirmed by a large number of observation in the past thirty years , to name a few , the velocity dispersions of dwarf spheroidal galaxies @xcite and the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies @xcite , _",
    "et al._. postulating that galaxies are surrounded by massive , non - luminous dark matter is the most widely adopted way to solve the problem @xcite .",
    "the dark matter hypothesis has dominated astronomy and cosmology for almost 80 years . however , up to now , no direct observations have been firmly tested .",
    "some models have been built as an alternative of the dark matter hypothesis .",
    "their main ideas are to assume that the newtonian gravity or newton s dynamics is invalid on galactic scales .",
    "the most successful and famous model is mond @xcite .",
    "it assumes that the newtonian dynamics does not hold on galactic scales .",
    "the mond paradigm is based on the following assumptions :  ( i ) it introduces a new physical constant @xmath8 .",
    "( ii ) the law of gravity returns to newton s gravity while @xmath9 . (",
    "iii ) the law of gravity is given as @xmath10 in the deep - mond limit , @xmath11 .",
    "as a phenomenological model , mond explains well the flat rotation curves of thousands of spiral galaxies with a simple formula and a universal constant .",
    "in particular , it naturally gives the well - known global scaling relation for spiral galaxies , the tully - fisher relation @xcite .",
    "the tully - fisher relation is an empirical relation between the total luminosity of a galaxy and the maximum rotational speed .",
    "it is of the form @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , if the luminosity is measured in the near - infrared region .",
    "tully and pierce @xcite showed that the tully - fisher relation appears to be convergent in the near - infrared region .",
    "mcgaugh @xcite investigated the tully - fisher relation for a large sample of galaxies , and concluded that the tully - fisher relation is a fundamental relation between the total baryonic mass and the rotational speed .",
    "mond @xcite predicted that the rotational speed of galaxy has an asymptotic value @xmath14 , which explains the tully - fisher relation .    by introducing several scalar , vector and tensor fields",
    ", bekenstein @xcite rewrote the mond into a covariant formulism ( teves ) .",
    "he showed that the mond satisfies all four classical tests of einstein s general relativity in solar system .",
    "however , mond still faces challenges .",
    "the strong and weak gravitational lensing observations of bullet cluster 1e0657 - 558 @xcite can not be explained by mond and its bekenstein s relativistic version @xcite .",
    "the icm ( intracluster medium ) gas accounts for most of the bullet cluster s mass .",
    "et al_. @xcite had reconstructed the surface mass density @xmath15 from the chandra space satellite x - ray image of the icm gas .",
    "et al_. @xcite had shown that the @xmath16-map of the icm gas of the main cluster can be well fitted with a king @xmath7-model density profile .",
    "the king @xmath7-model is a radial distribution of the mass density for a nearly isothermal and isotropic gas sphere . on the other hand , clowe _",
    "et al_. @xcite had reconstructed the convergence @xmath0-map from the strong and weak gravitational lensing survey .",
    "the @xmath0-map indicates that additional gravitational force is needed for explaining the bullet cluster .",
    "the center of gravitational force deviates from the center of the icm gas . and",
    "the distribution of gravitational force does not possess spherical symmetry .",
    "most of theories of modified gravity , such as bekenstein s relativistic version of mond , only consider radial force . also , most of the mass density profile of dark matter , such as the nfw profile @xcite , only contrive radial ( isotropic ) distributions .",
    "all of them can not explain the observations of the bullet cluster .",
    "the distribution of gravitational force in bullet cluster is anisotropic . to describe anisotropic force",
    ", one should introduce the multipole fields .",
    "the dipole contribution vanishes if one takes the center of icm gas as the coordinate origin .",
    "monopole contribution plus quadrupole contribution are needed to account for the observations of bullet cluster .",
    "in fact , milgrom gave a quasi - linear formulation of mond ( qumond)@xcite , which involves the quadrupole contribution .",
    "usually , mond effects vanish in newtonian regime .",
    "however , milgrom showed that quadrupole effect appears even in high - acceleration systems .",
    "besides , angus _ et al .",
    "_ presented an @xmath17-body code for solving the modified poisson equation of qumond @xcite .",
    "they used it to compute rotation curves for a sample of five spiral galaxies from the things sample @xcite and concluded that taking gas scale - heights of the gas - rich dwarf spiral galaxies ( and stellar scale - heights of stellar dominated galaxies ) as free parameters is vital to make precise conclusions about mond .",
    "other interesting results were also obtained in their work .    on the other hand , besides bekenstein s teves , there are other ` mondian ' theories ( for example , the einstein - aether theory @xcite ) . both the bekenstein s and the einstein - aether theory admit a preferred reference frame and broken local lorentz invariance .",
    "it can be reasonably inferred that the local lorentz invariance violation ( liv ) is an intrinsic feature of mond .",
    "if this is acknowledged , there follows a conclusion : the space structure near a galaxy is not minkowskian even at long distances from the galaxy center .",
    "it depends on the rotational velocity of the galaxy considering the relationship between the tully - fisher relation and mond .",
    "finsler gravity , which is based on finsler geometry , has the features mentioned above .",
    "thus it is natural to postulate that finsler gravity is a covariant formulism of mond .",
    "finsler geometry @xcite is a natural generalization of riemannian geometry with the latter as a special case .",
    "the length element of an arc on a finslerian manifold depends not only on position but also on velocity , which induces anisotropy .",
    "preservation of the fundamental principles is a prerequisite for finsler gravity as well as the results of general relativity .",
    "a new geometry ( i.e. the finsler geometry ) involves new spacetime symmetries .",
    "kostelecky @xcite has shown that liv is closely related to the finslerian geometry .",
    "effective field theories have been studied in his paper for explicit liv effects in finslerian spacetime .    in @xcite",
    ", we presented the vacuum field equation in finsler gravity , and have given the solution of field equation under weak field approximation . in @xcite , we presented the newtonian limit in finsler gravity and a covariant formulism of mond .",
    "we studied the spacetime structure of mond with properties of tully - fisher relation and lorentz invariance violation .",
    "a finsler spacetime has less symmetry than a minkowski one @xcite .",
    "multipole effects such as dipole and quadrupole contributions , which embody space anisotropies , should be considered in finsler gravity . in this paper",
    ", we try to construct a finslerian mond , a generalization of mond in finsler spacetime , and use it to explain the observations of bullet cluster .",
    "the rest of paper are organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is dedicated to the theory used for the numerical analysis and is separated into five parts : section 2.1 is about the basic concepts of finsler geometry ; in section 2.2 , we discuss the null set for massless particles ; in section 2.3 , we extend pirani s argument to a finsler spacetime to obtain the gravitational vacuum field equation in finsler gravity ; in section 2.4 , the newtonian limit in finsler spacetime is presented ; in section 2.5 , under post - newtonian approximation we give the finsler structure . in section 3 ,",
    "we give the convergence @xmath0 in our model .",
    "section 4 is about the numerical analysis which contains two parts : in section 4.1 , we consider the dipole and quadrupole contributions to the finslerian mond in the calculation of the convergence @xmath0 of the bullet cluster ; in section 4.2 , we obtain the mass density of the main cluster given the observed value of its surface temperature and compare it to the best - fit king @xmath7-model .",
    "numerical results are presented in 2d as well as in 3d figures .",
    "conclusions and necessary discussions are presented in section 5 .",
    "demonstrations of certain approximations in section 3 is presented in the appendix .",
    "finsler geometry is based on the so called finsler structure @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath18 is a non - negative real function which has the property @xmath19 for all @xmath20 , where @xmath21 represents position and @xmath22 represents velocity .",
    "the fundamental tensor is given as @xcite @xmath23 the arc length in finsler space is given as @xmath24 a more detailed discussion about @xmath18 can be found in section 5 .",
    "hereafter , we adopt the following index gymnastics : greek indices in lower case run from 1 to 4 , while latin indices in lower case ( except the alphabet @xmath25 ) run from 1 to 3 .    the parallel transport has been studied in the framework of cartan connection @xcite .",
    "the notation of parallel transport on a finsler manifold means that the length @xmath26 is constant . the geodesic equation on a finslerian manifold is given as @xcite @xmath27 where",
    "@xmath28 are called the geodesic spray coefficients .",
    "@xmath29 is arc length on the finsler manifold . obviously , if @xmath18 is a riemannian metric , then @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the riemannian christoffel symbol .",
    "since the geodesic equation ( [ geodesic ] ) is directly derived from the integral length @xmath32 the inner product @xmath33 of two parallel transported vectors is preserved .    on a finslerian manifold",
    ", there exists a linear connection  -  the chern connection @xcite .",
    "it is of torsion freeness and almost metric - compatible , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the formal christoffel symbols of the second kind with the same form of riemannian connection .",
    "@xmath36 is defined as @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the cartan tensor ( regarded as a measurement of deviation from the riemannian manifold ) . in terms of the chern connection ,",
    "the curvature of finsler space is given as @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "in finsler geometry , the finsler structure @xmath18 is defined as a non - negative @xmath42 function on the entire slit tangent bundle @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath44 .",
    "it ensures that the integral length ( [ integral length ] ) always makes sense ( since a negative arc length is not acceptable in mathematics ) . in physics , for a gravity theory",
    ", the quantity @xmath45 represents the line element of spacetime ( which is also called ` proper time interval ' in some references ) . a positive",
    ", zero and negative @xmath18 correspond to time - like , light - like ( ` null ' ) and space - like curves respectively . for massless particles ,",
    "the stipulation is @xmath41 .",
    "one should notice that many finslerian geometric objects like ricci scalar involves the finsler structure @xmath18",
    ". it might be invalid to describe the massless particles at first glance .",
    "however , the ambiguities caused by @xmath46 can be removed by re - parameterizing the formulae with some other parameter @xmath47 such that @xmath48 . the property of finsler structure @xmath19 guarantees that the length @xmath49 is independent of the choice of curve parameter . under a given parameter change @xmath50 , @xmath51 ,",
    "the length @xmath49 is of the form @xmath52 , where @xmath29 and @xmath47 are both curve parameters and @xmath53 ( or @xmath54 ) .",
    "the same trick has been played in general relativity for massless particles which has @xmath55 @xcite .    to construct finslerian special relativity",
    ", one should study the symmetry of finsler spacetime , i.e. the isometric group and killing vectors .",
    "for projectively flat ( @xmath56,@xmath7 ) spacetime with constant flag curvature , this was done in @xcite .      in this paper",
    ", we introduce the vacuum field equation in a way first discussed by pirani @xcite . in newton",

    "the vacuum field equation in general relativity gives @xmath71 @xcite .",

    ", @xmath76 is finsler curvature tensor defined in ( [ finsler curvature ] ) , ` @xmath69 ' here denotes covariant derivative @xmath77 .",
    "since the vacuum field equations of newton s gravity and general relativity are of similar forms , we may assume that vacuum field equation in finsler spacetime has similar requirements as in the case of netwon s gravity and general relativity .",
    "it implies that the tensor @xmath78 in finsler geodesic deviation equation should be traceless , @xmath79 .",
    "in fact , we have proved that the analogy of the geodesic deviation equation is valid at least in a finsler spacetime of berwald type @xcite .",
    "we assume that this analogy still holds its validity in a general finsler spacetime .    in finsler geometry",
    ", there is a geometrical invariant  the ricci scalar @xmath80 .",

    "the flag curvature is a geometrical invariant and a generalization of the sectional curvature in riemannian geometry .",
    "the ricci scalar @xmath80 is the trace of @xmath78 , which is the predecessor of flag curvature .",

    "it plays an important role in the geodesic deviation equation @xcite .",
    "the vanishing of the ricci scalar @xmath80 implies that the geodesic rays are parallel to each other .",
    "it means that it is vacuum outside the gravitational source .",
    "therefore , we have enough reasons to believe that the gravitational vacuum field equation in finsler geometry has its essence in @xmath1 .",

    "it is well known that the minkowski spacetime is a trivial solution of the einstein s vacuum field equation . in finsler spacetime",

    "the lowering and raising of indices are carried out by @xmath99 and its matrix inverse @xmath100 .",
    "we found from @xmath1 , to first order of @xmath97 , that @xmath101    in general relativity , one uses post - newtonian approximation to study the motion of particle @xcite . before studying the motion of particle in finsler gravity ,",
    "we must deal with the concept of energy - momentum tensor in finsler spacetime .",
    "it is well known that the energy - momentum tensor is conserved ( in the sense of covariant differentiation ) and symmetric in general relativity . however , this is not the case in finsler gravity .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is symmetric if the angular momentum is conserved @xcite .",
    "generally , the symmetry of angular momentum is broken in finsler spacetime @xcite .",

    "the reason is that these  torsion \" terms do not contribute to the geodesic deviation equation , which determines the motion of particles in finsler geometry .",

    "even this , the gravitational system is no more isotropic .",

    "the logic is : given a specific @xmath2 , we then proceed to calculate the convergence @xmath0-map and the temperature of the main cluster .",
    "the coefficient @xmath2 in our model comes directly from the flat finsler spacetime @xmath95 ( [ expand metric ] ) .",

    ", we have a total mass of @xmath225 and a distance range of @xmath226 kpc . the constant for mond",

    "a simple arithmetic exercise shows that the magnitude of the second term in the expression of @xmath163 ( i.e. the term @xmath228 ) is at about @xmath229 , which can be neglected comparing to the first term @xmath230 , of which value ranges from @xmath231 .",
    "the calculation in the last paragraph was carried assuming that @xmath214 is a constant .",
    "if mass @xmath214 is taken as a function of @xmath175 , i.e. @xmath232 , @xmath163 takes a form @xmath233 . using @xmath223 ,",
    "the third term on the right hand side of the above identity can be reduced into @xmath234 .",
    "the term @xmath235 has an order of @xmath236 kpc@xmath237 and @xmath238 @xmath239 , giving that the whole third term @xmath240 , which is negligible comparing to the first two terms in the expression of @xmath163 .",

    "again we can check that for the given parameters @xmath183 km / s and @xmath179 kpc , the term @xmath247 is also too small comparing to the first term @xmath248 .",
