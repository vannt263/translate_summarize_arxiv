    "the top quark is the heaviest fermion of the standard model .",
    "its large mass allows to probe deeply into the qcd potential for nonrelativistic @xmath0 system produced near energy threshold .",
    "such a system will provide a unique opportunity for a variety of novel qcd studies .",
    "the lifetime of the top quark is shorter than the formation time of top mesons and toponium resonances .",
    "therefore top decays intercept the process of hadronization at an early stage and practically eliminate associated nonperturbative effects .",
    "the analysis of polarized top quarks and their decays has recently attracted considerable attention , see @xcite and references cited therein .",
    "the reason is that this analysis will result in determination of the top quark coupling to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bosons either confirming the predictions of the standard model or providing clues for physics beyond .",
    "the latter possibility is particularly intriguing because @xmath4 plays an exceptional role in the fermion mass spectrum .",
    "the polarization fourvector @xmath5 of the top quark can be determined from the angular - energy distributions of the charged leptons in semileptonic @xmath6 decays . in the @xmath6 quark rest frame",
    "this distribution is in born approximation the product of the energy and the angular distributions@xcite : @xmath7\\,{{\\rm d}\\gamma\\over{\\rm d}e_\\ell } \\label{eq : elec1}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the angle between @xmath11 and the direction of the charged lepton .",
    "qcd corrections essentially do not spoil factorization@xcite .",
    "thus , the polarization analyzing power of the charged lepton energy - angular distribution remains maximal .",
    "there is no factorization for the neutrino energy - angular distribution which is therefore less sensitive to the polarization of the decaying top quark . on the other hand",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the angular - energy distribution of neutrinos from the polarized top quark decay will allow for a particularly sensitive test of the v - a structure of the weak charged current .",
    "a number of mechanisms has been suggested that will lead to polarized top quarks .",
    "however , studies at a linear electron - positron collider are particularly clean for precision tests .",
    "moreover , close to threshold and with longitudinally polarized electrons one can study decays of polarized top quarks under particularly convenient conditions : large event rates , well identified rest frame of the top quark , and large degree of polarization . at the same time , thanks to the spectacular success of the polarization program at slc @xcite , the longitudinal polarization of the electron beam will be an obvious option for a future linear collider has been reviewed in @xcite and the top quark polarization has been recently considered in @xcite . ] . in this article some results are presented of a recent calculation @xcite of top quark polarization for the reaction @xmath12 in the threshold region . in sect.2",
    "we discuss the dependence of the top quark polarization on the longitudinal polarizations of the beams . due to restricted phase space",
    "the amplitude is dominantly @xmath13 wave and the electron and positron polarizations are directly transferred to the top quark . for a quantitative study",
    "this simple picture has to be extended and the modifications originating from @xmath14 wave interference should be taken into account . in sect.3",
    "all these corrections are calculated from numerical solutions of lippmann - schwinger equations .",
    "we adopt the conventions of ref.@xcite and describe the longitudinal polarization of the @xmath1 system in its center - of - mass frame as a function of the variable @xmath15 where @xmath16 denote the polarizations of @xmath17 with respect to the directions of @xmath18 and @xmath19 beams , respectively collider @xmath20 , @xmath21 and then @xmath22 . ] . in the absence of phases from final state interaction , which can be induced by higher orders in @xmath23 and will be considered elsewhere @xcite , the top quark polarization is in the production plane . @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the longitudinal and the transverse components of top polarization vector ( in its rest frame ) with respect to the electron beam .",
    "the angle @xmath26 denotes the angle between @xmath19 and the top quark . in the threshold region",
    "the top quark is nonrelativistic ( with velocity @xmath27 ) and the kinetic energy of the @xmath0 system @xmath28 is of the order @xmath29 . retaining only the terms up to @xmath30 one derives the following expressions for the components of the polarization vector : @xmath31 -0.5 cm    = 5.5truein -0.2 cm    the coefficients",
    "@xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 depend on the polarization @xmath35 , the electroweak coupling constants , the @xmath3 mass and the center - of - mass energy @xmath36 .",
    "they are plotted in fig.[fig - clchi ] for @xmath37  gev . @xmath32 and @xmath33 are shown in fig.[fig - clchi]a as the solid and the dashed lines , respectively , and @xmath34 as the solid line in fig.[fig - clchi]b .",
    "the function @xmath38 describes the complicated dynamics of the @xmath0 system near threshold .",
    "in particular it includes effects of the would - be toponium resonances and coulomb enhancement .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to calculate this function using the green function method .",
    "the same function @xmath38 also governs the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath12 @xmath39 where @xmath40 is shown as the dashed line in fig.[fig - clchi]b .",
    "eqs.([eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) extend the results of @xcite into the threshold region .",
    "the green function method has become a standard tool for studying @xmath1 annihilation in the threshold region @xcite .",
    "we follow the momentum space approach of @xcite and solve the lippmann - schwinger equations numerically for the @xmath13-wave and @xmath41-wave green functions @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the momentum of the top quark in @xmath0 rest frame , @xmath44 @xmath45 denotes the top width and @xmath46 is the qcd potential in momentum space ; see @xcite for details .",
    "the function @xmath38 is related to @xmath47 and @xmath48 : @xmath49 where @xmath50 has been introduced in order to cut off a logarithmic divergence of the numerator .",
    "the denominator remains finite for @xmath51 . in experimental analyses",
    "the contributions of very large intrinsic momenta will be automatically suppressed by separation of @xmath0 events from the background . in our calculation",
    "we use @xmath52 . the function @xmath38 is plotted in fig.[fig - fir]a for @xmath37  gev .",
    "the qcd potential depends on @xmath53 and our results have been obtained for @xmath54 . for a comparison in fig.[fig - fir]b the annihilation cross section @xmath55 is shown in units of the annihilation cross section @xmath56 .",
