    "the tutte polynomial @xmath2 of a graph @xmath3 , due to w. t. tutte @xcite , is a two - variable polynomial and is deeply connected with many areas of both physics and mathematics .",
    "it is defined as @xmath4 where the sum runs over all the spanning subgraphs @xmath5 of @xmath3 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the number of components of @xmath3 . for a thorough survey on the tutte polynomial",
    ", we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the importance of the tutte polynomial comes from the rich information it contains about the underlying graph .",
    "it contains several other polynomial invariants , such as the chromatic polynomial , the flow polynomial , the jones polynomial and the all terminal reliability polynomial as partial evaluations , and various numerical invariants such as the number of spanning trees as complete evaluations .",
    "furthermore , the tutte polynomial has been widely studied in the field of statistical physics where it appears as the partition function of the zero - field potts model @xcite .",
    "in fact , let @xmath3 be a graph with @xmath9 vertices and @xmath8 components and let @xmath10 denote the partition function of the zero - field potts model , then @xmath11 and @xmath2 satisfy the following relation @xcite : @xmath12    in both fields of combinatorics and statistical physics , tutte polynomials of many graphs ( or lattices ) have been computed by different methods @xcite . recently , on the basis of the subgraph expansion definition of the tutte polynomial , a very useful method for computing the tutte polynomial , called the subgraph - decomposition method , was developed by donno _",
    "this technique is highly suited for computing the tutte polynomial of self - similar graphs , and some applications of it can be found in @xcite .",
    "the lattice ( network ) under consideration was introduced by kaufman _",
    "_ @xcite and was further studied by zhang _",
    "@xcite from the viewpoint of complex networks .",
    "the aim of this paper is to compute the tutte polynomial of this deterministic scale - free network . for this purpose , we first partition the set of spanning subgraphs of this network into two disjoint subsets . in this way",
    ", we can express the tutte polynomial by two summands .",
    "then , we study the contributions of all kinds of possible combinations of this two subsets .",
    "finally , base on the self - similar structure of the network , we obtain a recursive formula for each summand .",
    "in particular , as special cases of the general tutte polynomial , we get :    * the recursive formula for computing the tutte polynomial @xmath2 ; * the number @xmath13 of spanning trees and the asymptotic growth constant @xmath14 ; * the dimension of the bicycle space ; * the number of acyclic root - connected orientations ; the number of indegree sequences of strongly connected orientations .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss some necessary background that will be used for our calculations .",
    "we use standard graph terminology and the words  network \" and  graph \" indistinctly .",
    "let @xmath3 be a graph with vertex set @xmath15 and edge set @xmath16 .",
    "the vertices @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the end - points of an edge @xmath19 . an _ orientation _ of graph",
    "@xmath3 is the digraph defined by the choice of a direction for every edge of @xmath16 .",
    "a _ directed cycle _ of a digraph is a set of edges forming a cycle of the graph such that they are all directed accordingly with a direction for the cycle .",
    "a digraph is _ acyclic _ if it has no directed cycle , and _ strongly connected _ if for every pair of vertices there is a directed cycle containing them .",

    "in this section , we give the computational formulas of tutte polynomial of the lattice @xmath29 .",
    "it is easy to obtain that the order and size of the lattice @xmath29 are , respectively , @xmath35 and the average degree after @xmath9 iterations is @xmath36k@xmath37 , which approaches 4 in the infinite @xmath9 limit .    to investigate the tutte polynomial @xmath38 .",
    "first of all , we partition the set of the spanning subgraph of @xmath29 into two disjoint subsets :    * @xmath39 denotes the set of spanning subgraphs of @xmath29 , where two special vertices @xmath27 and @xmath28 of @xmath29 belong to the same component ; * @xmath40 denotes the set of spanning subgraphs of @xmath29 , where two special vertices @xmath27 and @xmath28 of @xmath29 do not belong to the same component .    :",

    "next , let @xmath42 denote the tutte polynomial @xmath38 of @xmath29 .",
    "for every @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the following polynomials :    * @xmath46 ; * @xmath47 .",
    "we have @xmath48    in order to obtain @xmath42 , we need to find recursive formulas on @xmath44 and @xmath45 . for this purpose",
    ", we analyze the relation between spanning subgraphs of @xmath25 and spanning subgraph of @xmath26 .",
    "observe from figure 2 that @xmath25 is constructed from four copies of @xmath26 by merging some special vertices and adding a new edge @xmath34 .",
    "thus , a spanning subgraphs of @xmath25 is combined by the spanning subgraphs of the four copies @xmath49 of @xmath26 with @xmath50 , where @xmath50 may be @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "indeed , a spanning subgraph @xmath5 of @xmath25 is uniquely determined by the restriction of @xmath5 to the four copies @xmath53 ( denoted by @xmath54 , respectively ) and @xmath50 , and vice versa .",
    "therefore , the tutte polynomial of @xmath25 can be written as @xmath55 where the sum runs over all spanning subgraphs @xmath56 of @xmath53 ( @xmath57 ) and @xmath50 .",
    "now , we need to know how @xmath58 and @xmath59 depend on @xmath60 and @xmath61 , for @xmath57 .",
    "note that @xmath62 , @xmath63 if @xmath64 and @xmath65 if @xmath66 .",
    "so , there are two cases to be considered .",
    "* case 1*. @xmath64 .    in this case , we consider the spanning subgraph @xmath5 of @xmath25 , which contains the new adding edge @xmath67 , and @xmath63 .    * subcase 1*. if @xmath68 , then @xmath69 moreover , we have @xmath70 and @xmath71 thus , @xmath72    * subcase 2*. if @xmath73 , then @xmath74 moreover , we have @xmath75 and @xmath76 hence , @xmath77    * subcase 3*. if @xmath78 , then we can obtained , similarly , that @xmath79    * case 2*. @xmath66 .    in this case , we consider the spanning subgraph @xmath5 of @xmath25 , which does not contain the new adding edge @xmath34 , and @xmath65 .",
    "* subcase 1*. if @xmath80 , then @xmath81 and @xmath82 thus , @xmath83    * subcase 2*. if @xmath73 , then @xmath74 moreover , we have @xmath84 and @xmath85 thus we have @xmath86    for the convenience of discussion , we use solid lines to join two special vertices when the corresponding spanning subgraph of @xmath29 belongs to @xmath39 ; otherwise , we use dotted lines instead of solid lines .",
    "we distinguish two types of the spanning subgraph as shown in figure 3 .

    "the strategy of the proof is to study all possible configurations of the spanning subgraph @xmath56 in @xmath94 ( @xmath57 ) , and analyze which kind of contributions they give to @xmath44 and @xmath45 . as shown in table 1 , a configuration produces a basic term of form @xmath95 , and by the previous analysis , each basic term has to be multiplied by a factor @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 or @xmath99 , @xmath100 according to case 1 and case 2 .",
    "more precisely , ( i ) the factor is @xmath96 if @xmath64 and @xmath80 ; ( ii ) the factor is @xmath97 if @xmath64 and @xmath73 ; ( iii ) the factor is @xmath101 if @xmath64 and @xmath78 ; ( iv ) the factor is @xmath102 if @xmath66 and @xmath80 ; ( v ) the factor is @xmath100 if @xmath66 and @xmath73 .    from table 1",
