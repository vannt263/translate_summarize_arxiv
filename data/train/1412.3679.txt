    "we present an interpretation of our recent measurement of the ratio @xmath4 of the neutron and @xmath0hg magnetic moments @xcite in terms of the strength of a possible short range spin - dependent neutron - nucleon interaction .",
    "this ratio was inferred from a comparison of the simultaneously recorded larmor precession frequencies of the two species contained in the same storage volume .",
    "the measurement was performed using the apparatus dedicated to the search for the neutron electric dipole moment ( nedm ) @xcite by the nedm collaboration at the ucn source @xcite of the paul scherrer institute , switzerland .    in the central storage vessel of the apparatus ,",
    "the spins of the neutrons and mercury atoms are made to precess simultaneously in the same volume .",
    "the ratio @xmath5 constitutes a sensitive tool for the control of systematic effects during the measurement of the nedm . by correcting @xmath6 properly for known differences of the larmor precession of the two species ucn and @xmath0hg , respectively ,",
    "the ratio of magnetic moments @xmath4 can be extracted .",
    "a data set of @xmath6 taken in 2012 was independently analysed in @xcite and in @xcite , where we additionally examined its sensitivity to hypothetical short range spin - dependent interactions .",
    "possible force mediators are axions , or axion - like particles and the interaction strength is proportional to the product of scalar and pseudoscalar coupling constants @xmath2 .",
    "it has been proposed in @xcite to use an nedm apparatus for the investigation of such a force .",
    "a motivation to search for an interaction involving @xmath2 is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : motivation ] .",
    "the influence of a short range spin - dependent interaction on the observable @xmath6 is explained and derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : exoticforceonr ] .",
    "our result is compared to other current limits on the product @xmath2 in sec .",
    "[ sec : comp ] .",
    "the investigation of cp violating processes is a major line of research in particle physics .",
    "in contrast to the weak interaction , there is so far no evidence that the strong interaction violates cp symmetry .",
    "the non - observation of an nedm at current sensitivity levels constrains the cp violating term ( _ @xmath7-term _ ) in the lagrangian of the strong interaction to be nine orders of magnitude smaller than naturally expected @xcite .",
    "this fact is known as _",
    "the strong cp problem _ and a solution to it was proposed in @xcite , where the spontaneously broken peccei - quinn symmetry was introduced .",
    "a new pseudoscalar boson emerges from this symmetry , the axion @xcite .",
    "an intrinsic feature of the peccei - quinn model is a fixed relation between mass and interaction strength of the axion .",
    "the originally assumed symmetry breaking scale ( corresponding to the electroweak scale ) was ruled out , leaving only higher energy scales possible . for the axion one thus expects a small mass and a feeble interaction with other particles .",
    "the possible mass of the axion is constrained by cosmology and astro - particle physics measurements to the so - called _ axion window _ @xcite .",
    "a short range spin - dependent interaction which could be mediated by an axion was proposed in @xcite . there , three classes of interactions were presented , involving either @xmath8- , @xmath2- , or @xmath9-couplings , whereas @xmath2-couplings are considered of particular interest , since they violate cp symmetry .",
    "a @xmath2-coupling diagram is shown in fig .  [ fig : gsgp_bulkmatter](a ) and takes place between an unpolarized particle @xmath10 ( where _ unpolarized _ means randomly polarized with respect to any quantization axis ) and a polarized particle @xmath11 . the symbol @xmath12 is used to denote properties of the particle interacting at the pseudoscalar vertex with a strength proportional to the coupling constant @xmath13 of the particle @xmath11 .",
    "the potential caused by such a @xmath14-coupling between an unpolarized particle and a polarized particle with mass @xmath15 and spin @xmath16 is derived as @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the unit vector of the spin , @xmath19 is the unit vector along the distance @xmath20 between the particles , and @xmath21 the interaction range .",
    "the product @xmath22 also violates parity p and time reversal symmetry t. @xmath2-couplings can also be mediated by other hypothetical spin - zero particles which are generic to the axion and usually referred to as axion - like particles .",
    "however , for these generic bosons no relation between mass and interaction strength is given , as compared to the genuine axion .",
    "the origin of such particles can be symmetries other than peccei - quinn symmetry , which are broken at very high energies and often postulated in theories beyond the standard model of particle physics , such as e.g.  string theory .",
    "thus , both axions and axion - like particles , are intriguing dark matter candidates and beyond standard model physics probes @xcite .    however , due to the non - observation of the nedm a short range spin - dependent interaction mediated by an axion is constrained to @xmath23 @xcite . on the other hand , if the force is mediated by an axion - like particle , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are not related to a specific symmetry breaking scale .",
    "thus , no significant constraint ( i.e.  comparable to experimental sensitivity ranges ) on @xmath2 can be deduced from current edm limits @xcite for the case of a generic boson being the interaction mediator .",
    "our measurement with ultracold neutrons is particularly sensitive to axion - like particles with a mass in the range of roughly 10mev to 100mev coupling to fermions .",
    "it also matches the mass range targeted by helioscopes such as cast @xcite which would be sensitive to axion - like particles coupling to photons .     and @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath10 is unpolarized and interacts at the scalar vertex with the coupling constant @xmath24 , whereas @xmath11 is polarized and interacts at the pseudoscalar vertex with the coupling constant @xmath13 .",
    "the total interaction strength is proportional to the product @xmath14 .",
    "( b ) a polarized neutron n with spin @xmath26 interacts with an unpolarized nucleon n at distance @xmath20 within bulk matter shaped as a plate of thickness @xmath27 .",
    "a view of the @xmath28-@xmath29 plane in a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath30 is shown . ]",
    "spin - polarized ultracold neutrons of energies below 150nev are confined in a cylindrical storage chamber with vertical axis , height @xmath31=12 cm , and inner diameter =47 cm at the center of the nedm apparatus .",
    "a vertical magnetic holding field of @xmath11 t is applied .",
    "the ucn spins precess for 180s and the precession frequency is inferred using ramsey s method @xcite .",
    "the spins of polarized @xmath0hg atoms precess simultaneously in the same volume allowing to correct the larmor precession frequency of the neutrons for magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "we search for a signature of a spin - dependent interaction between polarized particles inside the storage chamber and the unpolarized wall of this chamber .",
    "this interaction can be described by the potential of eq .",
    "[ eq : nfpotential ] and an example is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : gsgp_bulkmatter](b ) . integrating the interaction over all the nucleons present in uniform bulk matter results in an effective field normal to the surface .",
    "since the potential is spin - dependent , it can also be regarded as a pseudomagnetic field @xmath32 which can affect the larmor frequency of precessing spins . for a symmetric setup with identical material for the bottom and top of the storage vessel ,",
    "the field at the vessel surfaces points in opposite directions .",
    "therefore , we expect no shift in the larmor frequency of the hg atoms which sample the volume homogeneously .",
    "however , ucns have such low energies that they are significantly affected by gravity and their density increases towards the bottom of the storage vessel .",
    "thus , the vessel is inhomogeneously sampled and the effect of a pseudomagnetic field at the bottom of the chamber will not cancel out completely . depending on the sign of the vertical magnetic field , the precession frequency of the ucn spins will be increased or decreased . consequently , @xmath6 will be shifted by a constant with opposite sign for the upward or downward oriented magnetic holding field @xmath33 : @xmath34 where the @xmath35 sign applies to the upward / downward oriented magnetic holding field , respectively .",
    "the derivation of @xmath6 together with relevant systematic effects is detailed in @xcite .      integrating the potential given in eq .",
    "[ eq : nfpotential ] over bulk matter , e.g.  a plate of thickness @xmath27 and nucleon number density @xmath36 , results in a total potential @xmath37 at height @xmath29 above the surface of the plate ( cylindrical coordinates @xmath38 are used ) @xcite : @xmath39 since the interaction range @xmath21 is much smaller than the chamber diameter , the integration over the radial component @xmath28 is simplified to an infinite plane . the pseudomagnetic field @xmath32 normal to the surface can be written as a function of : @xmath40where @xmath41 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the polarized particle .",
    "this result agrees with the one derived in @xcite .    in order to calculate the field present in the nedm setup @xmath42 , both the bottom and the top of the storage vessel",
    "have to be taken into account .",
    "the vessel s inner horizontal surfaces are perpendicular to @xmath43 , with the bottom surface at @xmath44 and the top surface at @xmath45 . using eq .",
    "[ eq : pseudob ] one finds @xmath46 because of their inhomogeneous density distribution @xmath47 , the ucn experience an effective field given by @xmath48 the first order estimate for the ucn density distribution is @xmath49 where @xmath50=2.35(5)mm is the measured center - of - mass offset between ucn and hg atom distributions @xcite .",
    "since the pseudomagnetic field is expected to be of short interaction range @xmath21 given by the limits which have already been imposed on @xmath2 , the ucn density distribution can be approximated with a constant value within a distance @xmath1@xmath21 to the bottom and top surfaces . as a consequence , eq .",
    "[ eq : nfmagucn ] can be simplified in the following way : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "thus the integral can be solved analytically and the scalar and pseudoscalar coupling constants can be isolated as follows : @xmath54 the bottom and top of the ucn storage vessel are made of aluminum and have a thickness of @xmath55 cm each .",
    "we use @xmath56 and @xmath57mhz / t @xcite .",
    "the surface of the aluminum plates is coated with diamond - like carbon in order to improve neutron storage properties .",
    "the coating thickness is below 3 m and the density of diamond - like carbon is similar to that of aluminum . thus the coating is disregarded in the calculation but for the fact that we restrict the validity of our derived limit to @xmath58 m .",
    "the center - of - mass offset @xmath50 contributes to the denominator of eq .",
    "[ eq : gsgpisolated ] and depends on the energy spectrum of the ucn .",
    "hence , a change in the energy spectrum , or also a different vessel height @xmath31 , will influence the sensitivity of our apparatus to a pseudomagnetic field .    in @xcite ,",
    "two independent measurements for @xmath6 are presented , one for each direction of the magnetic holding field ( upwards and downwards , respectively ) : @xmath59 the sensitivity of the interpretation presented here depends explicitly on the uncertainties given in eqs .",
    "[ eq : r1 ] and [ eq : r2 ] .",
    "statistical and systematical contributions to these uncertainties are discussed in @xcite .    from the difference of @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : b_on_r ] ) we can extract @xmath62",
    "using eq .  [ eq : gsgpisolated ] , the measured pseudomagnetic field @xmath63 can be converted to a 95% confidence level limit on @xmath2 @xmath64 for 1@xmath65 mm . at the upper end of this range , the last factor in eq .",
    "[ eq : gsgpisolated ] departs from @xmath11 and the relation @xmath66 is not fulfilled anymore . as a consequence",
    "the sensitivity of our experiment to @xmath2 decreases which results in a flattening of the limit in the @xmath2 vs.  @xmath21-plane ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gsgperrorbudget ] ) . the lower end of this range is constrained by the wavelength of ultracold neutrons and affected by surface properties such as coating , roughness , etc .",
    "since we investigated an interaction between unpolarized nucleons and polarized neutrons , we can state that we probed the scalar coupling constant generally valid for nucleons @xmath67 and the pseudoscalar coupling constant specific to the neutron @xmath68 .",
    "as function of the interaction range @xmath21 of a short range spin - dependent force at 95% confidence level . on the top , the corresponding mass range of the mediating particle , i.e.  axion or axion - like particle , is shown .",
    "the shaded region is excluded by different experiments .",

    "can roughly be considered as a probe for the magnetic properties of this unpaired nucleon , regardless of the other constituents of the nucleus . under this assumption , both types of experiments probe @xmath72 . while these approaches are complementary , the direct neutron measurements are model independent . the most stringent limits for @xmath73 m have been imposed recently in @xcite and @xcite ( curves labelled f and g in fig .  [ fig : gsgperrorbudget ] , respectively ) which improved the recent limits from @xcite . for shorter interaction ranges ,",
    "the most stringent limit was given in @xcite ( e ) , where relaxation of spin polarized @xmath69he gas was investigated .",
    "this limit has been model independently confirmed and slightly improved by the measurements presented in this work ( h ) .",
    "limits derived from experiments with neutrons ( a , b , c , d ) @xcite were improved by one order of magnitude for @xmath74 and by two orders of magnitude for @xmath75 . in @xcite",
    "a stronger but indirect limit on @xmath2 was imposed by combining laboratory results with stellar energy loss arguments .",
    "such limits might be reached with dedicated future laboratory searches e.g.  proposed in @xcite .",
    "already our present result constitutes a new direct limit on @xmath2 .",
    "replacing in our experiment the central vessel bottom and top with copper , a material with higher density and good ucn reflecting surface properties , would result in a sensitivity gain of @xmath13 , corresponding to the density ratio between copper and aluminum .",
    "replacing either only the bottom or top would create a true asymmetric potential and increase the sensitivity by one order of magnitude @xcite .",
