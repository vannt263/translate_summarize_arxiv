    "inflation tends to make the universe so large that we can at best observe only a tiny part of it . even for a closed universe",
    "it has been argued that when there is a regime of eternal inflation , inhomogeneities can lead to an infinitely large reheating surface @xcite .",
    "bubble nucleation in false vacuum models , for instance , leads to inhomogeneous universes that contain infinite open spatial slices of constant density inside the bubbles @xcite .",
    "the issues that arise for prediction as a consequence of large or infinite sized universes are loosely referred to as the measure problem .",
    "this is one of a series of papers @xcite devoted to the measure for prediction provided by the no - boundary quantum state of the universe ( nbwf ) @xcite . if the universe is a quantum mechanical system it has a quantum state .",
    "this state predicts probabilities for alternative histories of the universe and everything in it , including the alternative histories of its spacetime geometry .",
    "it seems inevitable that any discussion of prediction in fundamental cosmology should take these probabilities into account .",
    "indeed , it is plausible that , except for an assumption of the typicality of our data , no measure beyond that supplied by the nbwf is needed for any observational prediction .",
    "previous papers @xcite considered the nbwf s predictions in homogeneous , isotropic minisuperspace models .",
    "we showed how the no - boundary measure for observations is well defined even in the limit of very large universes provided that the quantum nature of the observer making the observation is taken into account . in this paper",
    "we extend this work to consider linear fluctuations in matter and geometry away from homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "this enables us to consider predictions for observable quantities such as those connected with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "we continue to model the matter by a single scalar field moving in a quadratic potential .",
    "we also continue with our simple model of an observer as a physical system characterized by data @xmath0 and a probability @xmath1 to exist in any one hubble volume on spacelike surfaces specified by @xmath0 .",
    "we will describe our assumptions and procedures for calculation in section [ observations ] .",
    "but one crucial distinction should be mentioned at the outset  the difference between top - down ( ) and bottom - up ( ) probabilities @xcite .    by itself",
    ", the nbwf predicts the probabilities for the alternative , four - dimensional , classical histories that the universe may exhibit .",
    "we call these the probabilities for the classical ensemble",
    ". however , we do not observe entire histories .",
    "instead our observations are restricted to a light cone located somewhere in the universe and extending over roughly a hubble volume .",
    "predictions for observations in cosmology are necessarily conditioned on a description of the local observational situation in addition to the nbwf .",
    "for instance an observation of the cmb spectrum depends on _ when _ and _ where _ the observation is made in the history of the universe . in general",
    ", probabilities for _ our _ observations are conditioned on some part of our data @xmath0 and predict other properties of the universe .",
    "probabilities conditioned on some part of our data are called probabilities .",
    "they can differ significantly from the probabilities for the same alternatives as those for the number of efolds of inflation discussed in @xcite .",
    "the probabilities for perturbations that are within our current horizon that will be calculated here provide another illustration of this difference .    after a brief statement of our assumptions and procedures in section [ observations ]",
    "the paper proceeds to derive the probabilities for local observations related to fluctuations as follows : in sections [ classquantfluct ] and [ bottom - up ] we calculate the classical ensemble of four - dimensional , lorentzian , homogeneous and isotropic ( homo / iso ) histories with linear scalar fluctuations predicted by the semiclassical approximation to the nbwf .",
    "the real part of the euclidean action of the complex saddle - points corresponding to the different histories in the ensemble provides the nbwf probabilities of both the homo / iso backgrounds and their perturbations viewed as global features of the universe . from these bottom - up probabilities",
    "one can obtain predictions for local observations such as the cmb temperature anisotropies .",
    "this is done in sections [ top - down ] where we calculate the top - down probabilities for observing different perturbations inside our current horizon .",
    "we find a slightly non - gaussian spectrum of perturbations on currently observable scales in models where the most probable histories do not have a regime of eternal inflation .",
    "by contrast , for models where the dominant histories have a regime of eternal inflation , we find the nbwf predicts a gaussian spectrum of observable fluctuations . in section [ topdown_inei ]",
    "we comment on backreaction effects in the regime of eternal inflation , and argue that these are unlikely to change the above results . finally in section [ conclu ] we present our conclusions .",
    "[ sec2 ]    this section sets out our assumptions and procedures for calculating the probabilities for our observations from a quantum state of the universe .",
    "these are then illustrated in a simple model .",
    "_ a quantum universe with a quantum state .",
    "_ we assume that the universe is a closed quantum mechanical system with a particular quantum state . that state is taken to be the nbwf .",
    "the state predicts probabilities for the individual members of decoherent sets of alternative , coarse - grained , four - dimensional histories of the universe and its contents according to the principles of generalized quantum theory @xcite .",
    "we call these bottom - up ( bu ) probabilities .    _ bottom - up probabilities for the classical ensemble . _",
    "in particular , the state predicts the probabilities for the classical ensemble consisting of four - dimensional alternative histories with high probabilities for correlations in time governed by classical equations of motion . in @xcite",
    "we described how to calculate a semiclassical approximation for the probabilities of these histories from the semiclassical approximation to the nbwf assuming decoherence in an appropriate coarse graining . in this paper",
    "we restrict attention to probabilities of alternatives that can be defined in terms of these classical histories .",
    "simple examples are the probabilities for the number of inflationary efolds or for the size of fluctuations away from homogeneity and isotropy .    _ top - down probabilities for observations . _",
    "probabilities for our observations are not probabilities for a four - dimensional history of the universe",
    ". rather they are probabilities for local alternatives at a particular time and place in a classical history .",
    "they are constructed from the probabilities supplied by the nbwf by conditioning on at least that part of our data that describes what we know of our location in spacetime .",
    "we call probabilities conditioned on all or part of our data top - down ( td ) probabilities .",
    "_ observers as quantum systems . _ as observers we are quantum systems within the universe characterized at an appropriate coarse - grained level by the data @xmath0 that we possess  including a physical description of ourselves .",
    "we arose from physical processes that occurred over the universe s history .",
    "we are therefore not certain to exist in the universe , indeed , there is only a very tiny probability @xmath1 for an instance of the data @xmath0 in any hubble volume . however , in a very large universe the probability becomes significant that the data @xmath0 are replicated elsewhere .",
    "all we know for sure about the universe is that it exhibits at least one instance of the data @xmath0  a situation we abbreviate by @xmath2 .",
    "probabilities can differ significantly from probabilities for the same alternatives when these facts about observers are taken into account as we now illustrate in a very simple model .",

    "we consider these at a single moment of time .",

    "we denote them collectively by @xmath5 .",
    "the quantum state supplies probabilities @xmath6 for the values of the @xmath7 .",
    "the fields @xmath7 are crudely analogous to the fluctuations away from homogeneity and isotropy that we will consider later .",

    "we will be able to illustrate many of our procedures and results without getting bogged down in the elegant but complex technology of cosmological perturbation theory .",
    "we distinguish between local and global predictions .",
    "local predictions are for features of the universe inside a hubble volume  features that we could in principle observe in ours .",
    "examples are the cmb correlation functions .",
    "global predictions are for features of our universe that may extend outside our hubble volume or beyond the present time .",
    "examples are predictions of the number of efolds of inflation in the past or inhomogeneities outside the present horizon",
    ".    probabilities for the results of our observations are for local features of the universe conditioned on what we know about it  our data @xmath0 .",
    "all we know for certain from our data is that the universe exhibits at least one instance of it , @xmath2 . in the present model we can consider the probabilities for the value of @xmath9 in a hubble volume given @xmath2 .",
    "but we are not just interested in these probabilities in any hubble volume ; we are interested in them in _ our _ hubble volume .",
    "we discuss how to handle such first person questions generally in section [ thirdtofirst ] .",
    "but in cases where there is a symmetry between hubble volumes there is a shortcut to the answer .",
    "this simple model has such a symmetry  all the hubble volumes are the same .",
    "the probability for a value of @xmath9 in our hubble volume given @xmath2 is therefore the same as the probability that the universe exhibits a value of @xmath9 in any hubble volume given @xmath2 . and",
    "since @xmath9 is constant over the universe that is the same as the probability @xmath11 that the universe has a value of @xmath9 given @xmath2 .",
    "this can can be efficiently computed by starting from the relation @xmath12 the probability @xmath13 that there is at least one instance of @xmath0 in the universe given @xmath9 is @xmath14 minus the probability that there are no instances in any hubble volume .",
    "this is @xmath15 combining and gives @xmath16 p(z)}{\\int dz [ 1-(1-p_e(d))^{n_h(z ) } ] p(z ) } .\\ ] ] this is the probability for our observations of @xmath9 in this very simple model .",
    "eq for the probability of our observations of @xmath9 simplifies in two important limits .",
    "first , it simplifies when @xmath17 for the whole range of @xmath9 , that is , in the limit in which we are rare in the universe .",
    "then we have @xmath18 the difficult to estimate see @xcite . ]",
    "probability @xmath1 has cancelled out .",
    "@xmath10 would also cancel were it independent of @xmath9 leaving the probability for observation of a value @xmath9 equal to the probability that the universe has that value .",
    "but if @xmath10 depends on @xmath9 the probabilities for observation will differ from the bottom - up probabilities . in particular suppose the bottom - up probabilities @xmath19 are gaussian , that is a product of terms of the form @xmath20 .",
    "then the probabilities for observing @xmath9 will not be gaussian .",
    "the probabilities for values of @xmath9 that make the universe larger are enhanced over their values because in a larger universe there are more places for our data @xmath0 to be .",
    "the second limit in which @xmath11 is independent of @xmath1 is when @xmath21 for the whole range of @xmath9 .",
    "this is the limit where our universe is so large that our data are common .",
    "then , @xmath22 that is , probabilities equal probabilities . as a consequence ,",
    "gaussian probabilities imply a gaussian distribution for the probabilities of observing @xmath9 .",
    "thus , from local measurement of the @xmath7 an observer confident of the validity of this simple model could infer something about the size of the universe @xmath8 . that does not violate causality .",
    "the data @xmath0 may be assumed to be within our past light cone .",
    "but the quantum state predicts non - local correlations between the properties of different hubble volumes .",
    "these can be exploited to make predictions outside our hubble volume from data inside it .",
    "this is not qualitatively different from assuming that the universe is homogeneous and then inferring the mean density outside our hubble volume from observations inside .",
    "the common limit shows that predictions for observations can be defined even when there are an infinite number of hubble volumes provided that the probabilities are normalized . no ` measure ' beyond that provided by the quantum state is needed to deal with infinite volumes in these simple models .",
    "suppose that the probabilities for the @xmath9 s are gaussian .",
    "that is , suppose specifically that , @xmath23 as shows , gaussian probabilities do not necessarily imply gaussian probabilities for observation .",
    "but to understand a little more about the tests for _ non_-gaussianity let us first consider the common limit where the probabilities are gaussian .",
    "a complete description of our universe will generally require variables other than those we observe directly . in the absence of observation",
    "we may only have probabilities for these variables and the resulting probabilities for observation may not have the simple gaussian form .",
    "but , if a gaussian distribution is predicted for all values of the unknown variables , gaussian statistics for observation will still be predicted .",
    "this elementary but important point can be illustrated with a modest extension of our simple model .",
    "suppose that in addition to the @xmath9 s the widths of the gaussian distributions in depend on a variable @xmath24 so that @xmath25",
    ". then the probabilities for observation will be given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the probability for the unobserved @xmath24 . even if @xmath28 is a gaussian distribution of form with @xmath24 dependent @xmath29 s , the sum of them in",
    "will not be .",
    "consider functions of the @xmath7 s whose expected value vanishes for gaussian distributions and thus test gaussianity .",
    "an example is the correlation function @xmath30 if the expected value of such functions vanish for each @xmath24 it will also vanish for the sum .",
    "the point is that our universe is characterized by some value of @xmath24 even if we have not determined what it is .",
    "if gaussianity is predicted for all values of @xmath24 we predict gaussianity for our observations of the @xmath9 s despite our ignorance of @xmath24 s value .      the derivation of the probabilities for observation in our simple model relied on a symmetry  the equivalence of all hubble volumes . that symmetry allowed us to ignore all the other instances of our data @xmath0 that a large universe might exhibit and focus on our own .",
    "we will rely on an analogous underlying symmetry in our discussion of the fluctuations away from homogeneity and isotropy in section v. but lest the reader believe that a symmetry is essential to calculating probabilities for observations we present in this section a derivation in the simple model that does not require a symmetry and explicitly takes into account the instances of @xmath0 beyond our own .",
    "to begin let us calculate the probability @xmath31 that the universe has the value @xmath9 and @xmath32 hubble volumes with the data @xmath0 .",
    "this evidently is @xmath33 since all the hubble volumes are the same , the sum over locations of the @xmath32 instances has reduced to the binomial coefficient giving the number of ways of picking @xmath32 hubble volumes with observers out of @xmath10 total hubble volumes .",
    "the probability @xmath31 is an example of a _ third person probability _",
    " a probability for a feature the universe may exhibit independently of any relation to us .",
    "but we are interested in the _ first person probability _ of what value of @xmath9 _ we _ will observe .",
    "the theory , by itself , does nt predict such probabilities .",
    "we are one of the instances of @xmath0 but the theory does nt say which one . indeed , it has no notion of ` we ' .    to connect first person probabilities for what we observe with third person probabilities of what",
    "the universe exhibits a further assumption is needed .",
    "this assumption  called a xerographic distribution @xcite  specifies the probability that we are any one of the instances of @xmath0 .",
    "the simplest and least informative assumption is that we are equally likely to be any one of the instances of @xmath0 that the universe exhibits .",
    "put differently , it is the assumption that we are typical of those instances .",
    "this assumption is made throughout this paper .",
    "first person probabilities for what we observe are necessarily conditioned on the existence of at least one instance of our data @xmath0 in the universe  us !",
    "thus we write @xmath34 for the probability that we observe @xmath9 . to calculate this ,",
    "first calculate the joint probability @xmath35 as follows : suppose the universe exhibits @xmath32 instances of @xmath0 .",
    "use an index @xmath36 running from @xmath14 to @xmath32 to distinguish these .",
    "assuming typicality the xerographic distribution is @xmath37 .",
    "multiply this by the probability for @xmath32 instances and sum over @xmath36 .",
    "finally sum over the number of instances from @xmath38 ( at least one instance ) to @xmath39 .",

    "we find the complex solution for @xmath125 oscillates and is independent of the nature of the potential . on the other hand",

    "hence one expects the wave function @xmath130 depends only on the behavior of the potential for values of @xmath98 near the value taken by @xmath131 at the time the perturbation leaves the horizon . at horizon crossing the perturbation @xmath125 generally has an imaginary component .",
    "the requirement that @xmath125 be real at the boundary therefore means that the phase @xmath124 of @xmath132 at the sp should be tuned such that the imaginary component of the subhorizon mode function matches onto the decaying mode when the perturbation leaves the horizon .",
    "it turns out that this implies that a perturbation mode will become classical when its physical wavelength becomes much larger than the hubble radius , as is evident from fig [ classicality ] in appendix a.    as a consequence of the decay of the imaginary component of the perturbation the real part of the euclidean action @xmath133 tends to a constant when the mode leaves the horizon .",

    "in fact , it has been argued ( see e.g. @xcite )  albeit in part based on perturbation theory  that starting with a finite inflationary volume in the regime of eternal inflation , backreaction effects give rise to a significant probability for developing constant scalar field surfaces of arbitrarily large or even infinite volume .",
    "this implies that in models of eternal inflation it may not be correct to assume that our data is rare in every history of the ensemble .",
    "instead in a subset of histories the more general weighting , or even its common limit , may apply in the calculation of td probabilities rather than volume weighting .",
    "however this more general weighting is unlikely to change our results for the td probabilities @xmath211 obtained in section [ nongaussvolwgt ] , as we now explain .",
    "let us assume , as before , that the data are rare in all background histories , i.e. @xmath225 . the top - down weighting then implies that eternally inflating histories with large @xmath91 provide the dominant contribution to the td distribution @xcite .",
    "volume weighting will apply in approximately homogeneous and isotropic histories of this kind , yielding the gaussian contribution to the td distribution given in .",
    "however , if backreaction leads to a significant probability for the reheating surface to be infinite then the main contribution to the td distribution will come from significantly perturbed histories where our data are common because @xmath8 is large or infinite .",

    "hence predictions for observations are given by the bottom - up probabilities .",
    "one expects bu probabilities of observable fluctuations not to be affected by backreaction effects , since perturbation modes on currently observable scales leave the horizon well outside the regime of eternal inflation where these effects are negligible .",
    "hence we expect the result remains unchanged when backreaction is taken in account .    roughly speaking",
    ", one could say that in these models , by selecting histories with a large number of efolds , the top down weighting also makes it likely for there to be a hubble volume with any given local perturbation on surfaces of constant density . indeed in a sufficiently large universe",
    "anything will happen somewhere .",
    "hence the probability that a typical observer sees a particular fluctuation is determined by the relative frequency with which different fluctuations occur .",
    "but this is precisely what is given by the bu probabilities .",
    "this is an example where the quantum state specifies a measure for local prediction in cosmology that is well behaved for spatially large or infinite universes .",
    "the approach of this paper to cosmology in the regime of eternal inflation is significantly different from many others @xcite .",
    "we have started from the fundamental assumption that the universe , including all its contents , is a closed quantum mechanical system .",
    "we have explored the consequences of this for prediction in the regime of eternal inflation in simplified models in the context of the low - energy approximate quantum theory of gravity .",
    "like any other closed quantum system the universe has a quantum state .",
    "the nbwf is the model for this state used here .",
    "bottom - up probabilities for the different , coarse - grained histories of the universe and its contents follow from this state and not from a further posited measure .",
    "classical behavior of spacetime geometry is not assumed .",
    "rather the ensemble of possible classical histories of the universe is derived from its quantum state .",
    "observers are not assumed to necessarily exist , nor to be unique , nor to be essentially classical systems outside the reach of quantum mechanics .",
    "rather they are quantum subsystems of the universe described by certain data with a probability to exist in any hubble volume and a probability to be exactly replicated elsewhere in the universe .",
    "probabilities relevant for observations are top - down probabilities that take in account the observing system as a quantum subsystem of the universe .",
    "the starting point for the calculation of top - down probabilities are the bottom up probabilities for four - dimensional histories conditioned on just the nbwf  the universe sub specie aeternitatis .",
    "the nbwf predicts a particular ensemble of classical , inflationary histories with a characteristic set of perturbations that emerge from quantum fluctuations .",
    "the bottom - up probabilities favor histories with a small number of efolds @xcite .",
    "the perturbations are gaussian with variance @xmath226 evaluated at horizon crossing , where @xmath227 is the slow - roll parameter ( eq . ) .",
    "therefore in histories with a regime where @xmath228 , significant probabilities are predicted for large fluctuations that left the horizon while this condition holds .",
    "this is called the regime eternal inflation .",
    "the nbwf thus predicts that histories of this kind are _ inhomogeneous _ on the large scales that left the horizon during such a regime .",
    "in particular it predicts that any constant @xmath44 surface , such as the reheating surface , can differ significantly from the same surface in the homo / iso background .",
    "this result resonates well with other discussions of eternal inflation as well as numerical simulations using stochastic techniques @xcite .",
    "top - down probabilities are constructed from bottom - up probabilities by further conditioning on some part of our data that includes a description of the observational situation within the universe .",
    "if one conditions on data @xmath0 that localize the observer on one or several surfaces in each history then the general weighting connects top - down probabilities to bottom - up ones .",
    "this weighting is not a choice , or a postulate , or a proposal .",
    "instead it arises necessarily from four considerations : 1 ) our data @xmath0 occur within a given hubble volume only with some quantum probability @xmath199 .",
    "2 ) in a large universe our data may occur elsewhere with significant probability .",
    "3 ) all we know about the universe is that our history exhibits at least one instance of it .",
    "4 ) an assumption that we are equally likely to be any of the instances of @xmath0 that our universe exhibits .",

    "we find this implies that top - down probabilities favor histories with a large number of efolds in models that have a parameter regime where @xmath229 , with @xmath227 the slow - roll parameter @xcite . unlike this approximation ,",
    "the general weighting is well behaved even when spatial volumes become infinite .",
    "in fact for very large volumes , the quantum nature of the observational situation implies that the top - down probabilities for observations converge to the bottom - up probabilities .",
    "this is an important difference with other discussions of eternal inflation , usually not based on quantum cosmology .",
    "there the infinite volume limit instead leads to ambiguities . in those cases , to predict the outcome of our observations unambiguously , a measure must be introduced that regularizes the infinitely large spatial volumes that arise in the regime of eternal inflation . by contrast , in quantum cosmology the wave function provides the only measure needed for unambiguous prediction .",
    "furthermore , it does this as part of a unified framework that also explains the origin of inflation and of classical spacetime itself .    in this paper",
    "we have calculated the top - down probabilities for different fluctuations in models with a single scalar field @xmath44 with a quadratic potential @xmath230 .",
    "we find that the nbwf predicts a significantly inhomogeneous universe on very large scales and a gaussian spectrum of small perturbations on currently observable scales when there is a regime of eternal inflation , i.e. @xmath231 in the early universe .",

    "top - down probabilities predict a universe that is significantly inhomogeneous on scales much larger than the present horizon in models with eternal inflation .",
    "the top - down probabilities for prediction exemplified by depend only on data @xmath0 within our past light cone .",
    "( in the present models this data is approximated by data on a spacelike surface in our hubble volume . ) but they also depend on the implications of the theory for the structure of the universe on scales much larger than the present horizon .",
    "that is because top - down probabilities depend not only on what the data are on our past light cone , but also on where light cones with that data may be located in spacetime .",
    "this is determined in part by the quantum state , which predicts non - local correlations and in particular specifies what the allowed classical spacetimes are .    turning this connection around we see that from local observations we may draw inferences about the structure of our universe outside the present horizon , assuming of course that the theoretical framework behind these predictions is secure .",
    "the td predictions for the spectrum of primordial perturbations provide a striking example of this .",
    "these predict a specific form of non - gaussianity , but only in histories where we are rare .",
    "any observation of this non - gaussianity would therefore provide valuable information about the possible locations of our data and place an upper bound on the size of our universe .",
    "if by contrast this non - gaussianity turns out to be absent in the perturbation spectrum this would be evidence for a much larger , eternally inflating and therefore possibly infinite universe .",
    "thus if the values of the top - down probabilities depend on the large scale structure of the universe then the results of the observations they predict offer the opportunity to probe this structure .",
    "this striking connection between global structure and local observation is ultimately traceable to the nbwf which , like any quantum state , is defined globally not locally .",
    "the underlying homo / iso symmetry has of course greatly simplified the calculation of td probabilities in this paper .",
    "the symmetry means all hubble volumes on the surface where the data @xmath0 occur are equivalent , which essentially allows one to ignore all other instances of our data and focus on our own .",
    "in particular , the probabilities for different values of a perturbation mode @xmath117 in our own hubble volume given @xmath2 are the same as the probabilities that the universe exhibits different values of perturbations @xmath117 in any hubble volume given @xmath2 .",
    "the symmetry therefore automatically ` organizes ' the different hubble volumes , even when @xmath0 occurs on infinitely large surfaces .",
    "to apply the top - down approach to string theory which , it has been argued , at low energies predicts a potential landscape with finitely many vacua with different physics , one must generalize the calculations in this paper to models where the possible locations of @xmath0 are not all connected by symmetry . in models of this kind ,",
    "one expects the nbwf to select inflating histories that roll down from flat patches in the landscape where the slow roll conditions hold .",
    "however it appears plausible that besides histories where the background is homogeneous and isotropic , the ensemble also includes histories where our data occur on homogeneous surfaces in open frw universes that are bubbles inside de sitter space .",
    "this is because one can get histories of this kind from complex coleman - de luccia instantons that obey the no - boundary condition of regularity @xcite .",
    "if one neglects collisions between bubbles then all locations inside bubbles of the same type are equivalent , and only one ` representative ' location enters in the calculation of td probabilities .",
    "by contrast , the relative probability of finding our data in bubbles of different types ( or in histories without bubbles ) is important . in the nbwf",
    "this is given by the ratio of the real part of the actions of the corresponding instantons , yielding a well - defined prediction .",
    "thus , at the present moment , we see no obstacle of theory or practice to extending the results of this paper to more general and realistic models of the implications of a quantum universe .",
