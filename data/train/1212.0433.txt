    "@xmath4 represents the flux of light deviated in the direction @xmath3 .",
    "the evolution of deflection spectra along the object surface encodes information about its local curvature .",
    "this is why deflectometry is often used for characterizing transparent object surfaces .    in this paper",
    ", @xmath5 is conveniently represented by its projection in the @xmath6 plane , _",
    "i.e. _ , according the projected function @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , the object surface is assumed sufficiently smooth for being parametrized by a projection of @xmath9 in the same plane ( on a arbitrary fixed origin ) , so that @xmath9 is basically a 2-d vector .",
    "for most objects ( _ e.g. _ , with smooth surfaces ) deflections at any location @xmath0 occur in a limited range of angles .",
    "the deflection spectra therefore tend to be naturally _ sparse _ in plane @xmath10 or in some appropriate basis of this domain ( _ e.g. _ , wavelets ) .",
    "[ fig:2dspec - fullsetrecon](right ) shows an example of a discretized deflection spectrum @xmath11 for one location of a plano convex lens obtained using the setup described in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] .",
    "the white spot in the image signifies that deflections occur at only a few angles ( as governed by classical optics ) and deflections elsewhere are negligible .    measuring a deflection spectrum @xmath11 for every @xmath0",
    "is not straightforward . the optical setup described in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] measures them indirectly by optical comparison with a certain number of programmable modulation patterns . to maximize the amount of information collected in this process , we exploit the sparse nature of spectra in each plane @xmath10 and use the framework of _",

    "[ sec : reconresults ] .",
    "further , from the possibility of performing signal processing in the compressed domain  @xcite , we also show in sec .",
    "[ sec : specchar ] that for localized deflection spectra summarized by a few optical parameters ( _ e.g. _ , location and width of the main peak ) the compressed optical observations themselves can be processed .",
    "this is aimed at extracting the relevant information at a smaller number of measurements than those required for a full spectrum reconstruction .",
    "a 2-d schematic of schlieren deflectometer . ]",
    "deflection spectra can be measured by the schlieren deflectometer represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pss ] . its key components are _",
    "( i ) _ a spatial light modulator ( slm ) , _ ( ii ) _ the schlieren lens with focal length @xmath12 , _ ( iii ) _ the telecentric system ( ts ) and _ ( iv ) _ the charged coupled device ( ccd ) camera collecting the light .    the object to be analyzed is placed in between the schlieren lens and the telecentric system .",
    "it is shined on its left by a light source and , thanks to the telecentric system , only the parallel light rays emerging out from the object are collected by the ccd .",
    "moreover , up to a flipping around the optical axis , each location @xmath0 on the object , at a distance @xmath13 from the optical axis @xmath14 ( dashed line ) , is probed by a corresponding ccd pixel also at a distance of @xmath13 from @xmath14 .",
    "each location @xmath9 is thus in one - to - one correspondence with a ccd pixel and we will sometimes consider @xmath9 as ccd pixel location .    from classical optics , a light ray that is incident on location @xmath0 at an angle @xmath15 originates from the light source at a distance of @xmath16 from the optical axis .",
    "likewise , the light rays originating at different locations on the source have different incident angles at @xmath0 .",
    "since we can always virtually invert the light propagation in the system , everything works as if the object was shined on its right by a beam of parallel light rays .",
    "therefore , up to a global scaling by @xmath17 , the slm plane is actually the local plane @xmath10 of the deflection spectrum occurring at @xmath9 .",
    "modulating the slm corresponds to modulating @xmath11 , while the light collected in ccd pixel @xmath9 is just an inner product of @xmath11 with the modulation .",
    "if we generate @xmath18 such modulations @xmath19 with @xmath20 in the slm of @xmath21 pixels , considering the discrete nature of the ccd camera ( having @xmath22 pixels ) , the discretized deflection spectra are observed through @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the sensing matrix , @xmath25 is a ccd pixel index , @xmath26 is the discretized spectrum at the @xmath27 pixel / object location , and @xmath28 models the measurement noise ( assumed gaussian ) . notice that the slm and the ccd 2-d grids are represented as 1-d spaces in order to ease the notation , so that @xmath29 is then a sensing 2-d matrix acting on 1-d vectors .",
    "the quest now is to optimize the design of @xmath29 in order to maximize the spectrum information captured in each @xmath30 , _",
    "i.e. _ , using compressed sensing theory .",
    "a well known example of inner products based imaging system is the rice university s _ single pixel camera _  @xcite .",
    "this camera uses a single photosensor to capture the inner products between the scene to be imaged and random binary modulation patterns , realised using a micro - mirror array . in our deflectometric system",
    ", each ccd pixel behaves like a single pixel camera , which poses a great computational challenge for reconstruction .",
    "we can notice also that a binary slm modulation for compressive imaging is also advocated in @xcite for performing random convolutions of images . however , this method modulates the fourier transform of the signal of interest and not its spatial domain representation .",
    "the previous use of schlieren deflectometer is in the phase shifting schlieren ( pss ) system .",
    "pss quantitively measures the deviation angles from the deflectometric measurements , by assuming single deflection for each object location .",
    "it overcomes several calibration issues of the traditional deflectometry by using multiline phase shifted spatial filters in the slm  @xcite . in this case , the ccd pixel values @xmath31 directly encode the deviation angle of the corresponding object location @xmath32 . by making several measurements with phase shifted sinusoidal modulations as @xmath29",
    ", the deviation angle is then numerically decoded from the @xmath31 , using @xmath33-step algorithms  @xcite .",
    "pss has been successfully used in tomographic applications such as refractive index map reconstruction  @xcite . however , the phase shifting method is unable to recover the full deflection spectra or to estimate several main deflection angles per point .",
    "moreover , the use of non - binary modulation patterns brings in the problem of non - linearity in the slm response .",
    "this is one of the reasons why we advocate using binary modulation patterns as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : reconresults ] .",
    "compressive sensing ( cs ) shows that any signal @xmath34 , having a _ sparse _ representation in an orthonormal _ sparsity basis _ @xmath35 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath36 , can be tractably recovered from a few corrupted linear measurements of the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the conjugate transpose , @xmath39 is an orthonormal _ sensing basis _ , @xmath40 is the submatrix formed by restricting the columns of @xmath41 to those belonging to @xmath42 : = \\{1,\\,\\cdots , n\\}$ ] and @xmath43 is a gaussian noise vector .",
    "in particular , if @xmath44 has size @xmath18 and is drawn uniformly at random in @xmath45 $ ] , and if @xmath41 and @xmath46 are incoherent , meaning that the _ coherence _",
    "@xmath47 is very close to 1 , then , @xmath48 measurements are enough to recover a good estimate of @xmath49  @xcite",
    ". this reconstruction is performed by solving the following convex optimization @xmath50 where @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is a bound on @xmath53 . under the previous conditions , the theory guantees that  @xcite @xmath54 holds with a probability at least @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the best @xmath57-term approximation of the vector @xmath58 .",
    "as shown above , the number of the measurements scales quadratically as @xmath59 and hence it is desirable to have the two bases as incoherent as possible to make @xmath59 close to @xmath60 . in order to circumvent this problem",
    ", @xcite cleverly makes the sensing and sparsity bases incoherent by a simple pre - modulation , or _",
    "spread spectrum _ , of the data vector @xmath61 .",
    "this technique is optimal for _ universal _ sensing basis , _",
    "i.e. _ , when all the entries of @xmath29 have the same complex amplitude , which is the case for fourier and hadamard bases .    mathematically , with random modulation , the sensing matrix becomes @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal is a random vector @xmath64 such that @xmath65 , _ e.g. _ , a steinhaus or rademacher sequence . in this case , we need @xmath66 measurements in order to recover a solution @xmath67 of   satisfying   with a probability at least @xmath68 , for some @xmath69 .",
    "noticeably , the coherence has disappeared from the condition implying that with spread spectrum and universal sensing basis , the recovery guarantee is _ universal _ , irrespective of the sparsity basis .",
    "we see in next section how to exploit the spread spectrum method in our optical setup .",
    "we propose to combine the schlieren deflectometer of sec .  [",
    "sec : setup ] with the spread spectrum cs principles described above .",
    "+ * optical sensing : * since it is essential to have real valued sensing basis and spread spectrum vector , as allowed by @xcite , we use the hadamard ( universal ) basis @xmath70 for sensing , with @xmath71 and @xmath72 , combined with a random rademacher vector @xmath64 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath73 independently with equal probability .",
    "since the slm accepts only positive values , once the random set @xmath74 $ ] has been drawn , the corresponding sensing matrix @xmath75 must be suitably _ biased _ and scaled as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the vector of ones .",
    "the choice of hadamard makes the biased sensing binary .",
    "this has interesting advantages in the optical setup since it avoids any non - linear response of the slm for non - binary values .",
    "moreover , thanks to an extra measurement of each @xmath78 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the value @xmath79 obtained by an entirely transparent slm , any measurement vector @xmath80 can be debiased by    @xmath81    up to a correct evaluation of the noise , which corrupts @xmath82 , @xmath83 and the debiasing process , we can therefore reconstruct @xmath78 from the unbiased @xmath31 . + * noise estimation : * if there is no test object , then by classical optics the measured deflection spectrum is constant in all ccd pixels and corresponds to a simple disk centered on the origin of the spectrum domain .",
    "we denote it as @xmath84 .",
    "the disk diameter is proportional to the pinhole diameter of the system ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pss ] ) .",
    "this prior information aids us in calibrating the system and in estimating the noise level on the measurements .    from actual measurements in the absence of test object ,",
    "we obtain , on an arbitrary ccd pixel , @xmath85 , where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the unknown signal and observation noises . after a small calibration of the slm origin , and up to a small optimization of the disk height in @xmath84",
    ", we can therefore compute a bound on the noise power as @xmath88 .",
    "we can either obtain this value for every @xmath18 or estimate it for @xmath89 only and scale the result as @xmath90 for @xmath91 . + * reconstruction method : * for the reconstruction , we select the daubechies 9/7 wavelet basis as our sparsity basis  @xcite .",
    "this offers a sparser representation of the deflection spectra than the canonical ( dirac ) basis . to reconstruct the deflection spectrum at any location @xmath32 ,",
    "an estimate of the sparse wavelet coefficients @xmath92 is obtained by solving   with the @xmath52 estimated above .",

    "10 independent reconstruction trials were performed for several values of @xmath102 , by randomly drawing a new @xmath42 $ ] every time .",

    "the performance curves for both the lenses almost overlap , and the osnr improves as @xmath106 increases . though the absolute values of osnr seem low , its significance has be understood in the light of the input snr , which is approximately computed as @xmath107 db .",
    "the horizontal dotted line on the plot indicates the isnr for our experiments , and it is clear that the reconstruction procedure improves the osnr , beyond the isnr , thereby demonstrating the ability of cs reconstruction of deflection spectra in low input snr regime .    . ]",
    "suppose we are interested in summarizing the deflection spectra by a few parameters that characterize them at each location .",
    "for example , we could summarize a spectrum by the location of the bright feature it contains . to address this ,",
    "we propose the following robust method to localize the feature .    assuming that the feature is circular and its radius @xmath108 can be known a priori",
    ", the feature can be localized using a matched filter . to this end",
    ", we employ a template @xmath109 , which contains a two - dimensional gaussian of width @xmath108 at its center . to localize the feature in a spectrum @xmath95 we simply translate @xmath109 over the support of the spectrum and find the best translation @xmath110 that maximizes the correlation between the spectrum and the translated template @xmath111 .",
    "by letting @xmath112 to denote the vectorized form of @xmath111 , we solve    @xmath113    with an abused terminology we designate the translation parameters @xmath114 as the _ centroids _ of the spectral features .",
    "these centroids also provide local information about the mean deflection angles at various locations .    in order to characterize an object using the centroids defined in",
    ", we have to reconstruct the spectra at all @xmath22 locations individually and then compute the centroids , which requires huge computational time .",
    "it essential therefore to explore the possibility of computing the centroids right from the measurements @xmath31 , without even reconstructing the spectra .",

    "the horizontal dotted line indicates a unit pixel error and it can be seen that the compressive centroid estimation achieves sub - pixel accuracy , even with the number of measurements as low as @xmath121 ( @xmath122 measurements ) for the @xmath99d lens , and about @xmath123 for the @xmath98d lens .",
