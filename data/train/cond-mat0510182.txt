    "josephson junctions of two superconductors via two - dimensional electron gas , ( most usually implemented in the nb / inas / nb structures ) were actively studied both experimentally and theoretically , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite",
    ". generic feature of all these devices is strong reduction of the experimentally measured product @xmath0 with respect to the theoretical predictions . in particular , this discrepancy is known for short junctions with high - quality s / n interfaces , demonstrated by measurement of a non - sinusoidal current - phase relation  @xcite . at the temperatures much below @xmath1 , the parameter @xmath2 was measured in ref .  , to be compared with the niobium superconductive gap @xmath3 .",
    "thus it seems natural to look for some effects which were not taken into account in the existing theory , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite , but could be responsible for such a drastic suppression of the critical current .",
    "an obvious candidate to be explored is the rashba spin - orbital interaction  @xcite @xmath4 \\cdot { \\bf n}$ ] known to exist in the 2deg structures due to up - down asymmetry of the quantum well ( here @xmath5 is the unit vector normal to the plane of the 2deg ) . in the inas",
    "heterostructures this term is especially large ( cf . ref .  ) , leading to the band splitting @xmath6 , i.e. considerably larger than the niobium superconductive gap .",
    "therefore it seems natural that the account of the rashba term might be important for analysis of the josephson current in these devices .",
    "we also note in this relation the paper  @xcite , where it was shown that persistent currents in mesoscopic metal rings should be modified strongly by so coupling - which seems to point out the existence of similar effect upon the josephson current .",
    "however , it is frequently assumed that the spin - orbital interaction can not influence proximity effect in superconductive structures , since it respects time - reversal invariance .",
    "this argument is not valid , however , when the critical josephson current is considered , since the presence of a current already breaks down the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "more detailed arguments seem to come from recent papers  @xcite , where the influence of both rashba coupling and zeeman magnetic field upon the critical current of s - n - s junctions was considered . in both these papers",
    "it was found that in the absence of the zeeman term the rashba interaction ( if treated within the simplest model of equal fermi velocities on both chiral branches ) totally cancels out from the equations for andreev levels .",
    "we will show , however , that this cancellation is not generic ; rather it is due to different simplifications used in the papers mentioned : a model of completely transparent s",
    "/ n interfaces was employed in ref .  , and a purely one - dimensional model used in ref .  .",
    "it will be shown below that in the general case , when some normal backscattering at an arbitrary angle of incidence occurs at the s - n boundaries , the spin - orbital coupling does affect the energies of the andreev levels and the supercurrent they carry on .",
    "we will show that the effect of so interaction can be understood as being due to modification of the transmission channels defined by the scattering matrix @xmath7 , which describes the junction properties in the normal state . for a model junction with infinite length ( or periodic boundary conditions ) in the direction transverse to the supercurrent",
    ", spin - orbit splitting of transmission eigenvalues is found , which results in splitting of each andreev level into pair of spin - polarized levels , with phase - dependent energy difference @xmath8 .",
    "note , that @xmath9 , in agreement with the time - reversal invariance restored in the absence of the phase bias .",
    "the idea that the andreev levels can be spin - splitted due to the so coupling was proposed in ref .   for a narrow ( few - channel ) junction .",
    "the so effect we discuss in the present paper is different from the one presented in ref .  .",
    "in this paper we consider the simplest two - dimensional model of ballistic s-2deg - s junction ( cf . e.g.  ref .  ) of infinite width in the lateral direction transverse to the current flow , see .",
    "fig .  1 .",
    "we neglect possible potential barriers at the s / n interfaces , assuming that the normal backscattering is due to fermi - velocity mismatch only , and consider ballistic electron propagation along 2d structure between superconductive terminals . in the sec .",
    "ii of the paper we show that in the short junction limit ( junction length @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the fermi - velocity of 2deg ) the positions of the andreev levels can be expressed via the transmission eigenvalues @xmath12 of the full scattering matrix @xmath7 in precisely the same way as was found by beenakker  @xcite for junctions with spin - independent scattering . then in sec .",
    "iii we present calculations of the scattering matrix @xmath7 for the simplest two - dimensional model of ballistic s-2deg - s junction ( cf .",
    "e. g. ref .  ) of infinite width in the lateral direction transverse to the current flow , see .",
    "fig .  1 .",
    "we demonstrate explicitly spin - splitting of the transmission probabilities @xmath13 for the transmission channels characterized by the momentum component @xmath14 .",
    "we show then , that the distribution function for the transmission probabilities @xmath15 coincides with the one discussed by melsen and beenakker  @xcite in the absence of spin - orbital coupling . in the sec .",
    "iv we derive expression for the josephson current of a short junction and demonstrate that _ average _ current is insensitive to the rashba coupling . in sec.v",
    "we go beyond the short - junction limit : we derive an equation for spin - splitted andreev levels for the junction with arbitrary @xmath16 ratio and demonstrate that their contribution to the average ( semiclassical ) supercurrent is insensitive to the so coupling .",
    "section vi is devoted to the discussion of applicability of our results to s-2deg - s junctions of finite width and possible ways to detect spin - splitted andreev levels .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "vii we present our conclusions and discuss open problems ; in particular , it is proposed that the account of electron - electron interaction _ together _ with rashba coupling might be able to explain josephson current .",

    "further on , within the short junction limit @xmath43 , scattering matrices @xmath44 do not depend on energy , moreover @xmath45 .",

    "below we show that solution of the same kind can be obtained when the spin - orbital scattering is present .    in the presence of spin - orbital interaction the scattering matrix in  ( [ andreevdet1 ] )",
    "becomes spin - dependent but still obeys time - reversal invariance .",
    "it makes possible to generalize beenakker s derivation for andreev levels in short junction  @xcite using the following set of relations for the @xmath7-matrix : @xmath50 where the superscript @xmath51 means full matrix transposition .",

    "it is important to note the sign change of the parameter @xmath14 in the second and the third relations above : when all scattering states are characterized by a conserved momentum ( @xmath14 ) , the time - conjugation operation contains complex conjugation and @xmath54 inversion , since time reversal of the scattering matrix should change the sign of @xmath55 only , while keeping @xmath14 intact . in other terms",

    "the degeneracy is due to the symmetry of @xmath202 with respect to @xmath54 reflection , whereas in the second case it is due to kramers theorem . in order to get global andreev spectrum without degeneracy",
    ", the time - reversal symmetry should be broken .",
    "in particular , it happens if nonzero @xmath16 ratio is taken into account , as reported in ref .  .",
    "another possibility might be related with an _ open _ sample geometry like the one used in ref .  , where additional current can be passed in the direction transverse to the supercurrent .",
    "individual andreev levels could possible be observed experimentally by microwave spectroscopy or by measurement of tunnelling conductance into the 2deg region from an additional point - like junction .",
    "one version of the former type of experiment was proposed theoretically , for a single - channel junction , in ref .  .",
    "in this case , resonant frequency is very high , of the order of @xmath203 , since the only possible transitions are between the positive and the negative andreev levels .",
    "this frequency is about 0.4 thz for nb terminals ( considerably lower frequencies can be found in the case of a very small reflection probability , @xmath204 and a phase difference @xmath205 ) . in many - channel junctions energy spacing between neighboring andreev levels",
    "is reduced as @xmath206 , but usually ( without spin - orbit coupling ) it is not possible to observe microwave - induced transitions between levels which belong to different conduction channels .",
    "the reason is the momentum conservation : different transmission channels are characterized by different wavevectors @xmath207 which are spaced by @xmath208 , whereas photon wavelength @xmath209 is much longer than @xmath195 , their ratio is of the order of @xmath210 .",
    "it seems possible that this selection rule will not be effective in the considered situation with rashba coupling , which modifies conduction channels considerably at @xmath211 .",
    "the point is that now conduction channels will be defined in the entangled space of orbital and spin variables , thus there seems to be no reason for vanishing of the inter - channel photon matrix element .",
    "however , this question will certainly need further investigation .",
    "we investigated the dependence of josephson currents in clean s - rashba 2deg - s proximity junctions upon the rashba spin - orbit interaction .",
    "we have generalized the beenakker s formula for the andreev levels for the case of spin - orbital scattering and found that for the case of an infinitely wide junction ( in direction transverse to the current ) , the andreev levels are spin - splitted .",
    "this result is in agreement with papers  [ ] , where the effect of rashba spin - orbital interaction upon supercurrent was studied either  @xcite in the case of absence of normal backscattering at the interfaces ( @xmath175 ) , or in the one - dimensional case  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the semiclassical average of the josephson current is however insensitive to the rashba coupling as long as electron - electron interaction in 2deg is neglected .",
    "our results show therefore that the account of the rashba spin - orbital interaction for the usual model of sns junction without electron - electron interaction in the normal region is not sufficient to explain experimentally observed strong suppression of the @xmath0 parameter with respect to its theoretical value .",
    "we believe that to explain this suppression the electron - electron interaction should be taken into account together with the spin - orbital effects .",
    "we note that electron - electron interactions in both density - density and spin - spin channels are not weak in the 2deg structures .",
    "a related open problem is to find average spin polarization @xmath212 in the 2deg region , which is expected to exist at a nonzero supercurrent in the s-2deg - s structure due to symmetry considerations , cf .",
    "e.g. ref .  .",
    "note that a supercurrent - induced average spin polarization will induce , in the presence of electron - electron interaction , an effective zeeman field which may strongly modify the andreev levels as well as the josephson current .",
    "we are grateful to c. w. j. beenakker , ya .",
    "m. blanter , i. v. bobkova , a. m. finkelstein , f. giazotto , p. m. ostrovsky , n. m. shchelkachev and h. takayanagi for many useful discussions .",
