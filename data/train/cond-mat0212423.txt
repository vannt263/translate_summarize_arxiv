    "composite fermions are quasi - particles constructed of interacting electrons confined to a plane and an even number of flux quanta attached to them @xcite .",
    "they have been introduced in order to explain the features in the high - magnetic field magneto- and hall - conductances in the region of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) @xcite .",
    "basically , the attachment of fluxes is used to compensate on the average the external magnetic field at certain ( even - denominator ) values of the filling factor  the ratio between electron density and magnetic flux density  in such a way that the interaction between the electrons is incorporated into single - electron parameters as the effective mass which becomes dependent on the magnetic field .",
    "the system of cf behaves then as a fermi liquid of non - interacting quasi - particles which can serve as a starting point for a perturbational treatment @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the rational filling factors with odd denominators at which the quantization features of the fqhe appear can be understood as the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) @xcite of the composite fermions @xcite . a field",
    "theoretical approach to composite fermions has been successfully constructed by using the path integral formalism and by introducing a chern - simons gauge field @xcite .",
    "direct experimental evidences for the existence of composite fermions have been found by investigating the magneto - transport in spatially modulated quantum hall systems .",
    "the experimentally detected resistance oscillations have been interpreted by constructing certain trajectories of quasi particles that were commensurable with the spatial modulation of the two dimensional electronic system @xcite .",
    "originally , the composite fermion description has been developed for fully spin - polarized quantum hall states .",
    "there are , however , experiments in the region of low magnetic field which indicate that fqhe - ground states can be spin unpolarized @xcite .",
    "recently , the spin polarization of fqhe - ground states have been measured by radiative recombination of electrons in the inversion layer of high - electron mobility gaas / algaas - heterostructures with holes bound to acceptors in the delta - doped region @xcite . the spin polarization as a function of the magnetic field for several fixed filling",
    "factors has been investigated .",
    "crossovers between fqhe - ground states with different spin polarizations have been found at certain values of the magnetic field @xmath1 . when varying @xmath1 , the polarization of a ground state remains constant within a large region until a certain crossover field @xmath2 is reached .",
    "then , the system is transferred to a new differently polarized ground state which remains again stable when @xmath1 is changed .",
    "the data have been found to be consistent with the model of non - interacting composite fermions but with an effective mass that scales @xmath3 .",
    "the regions of constant spin polarization are then due to the occupation of a fixed number of spin split composite fermion landau levels .",
    "the crossover occurs when intersections of the latter coincide with the fermi level .",
    "most strikingly , near the crossover fields , plateaus with spin polarizations almost exactly intermediate between the fully spin polarized states appear for temperatures extrapolated to absolute zero .",
    "this indicates additional features beyond the non - interacting composite fermion model and could be signature of partially polarized collective states . in these experiments ,",
    "the system has been tuned towards spin degeneracy by making use of the fact that the zeeman splitting @xmath4 and the cyclotron splitting @xmath5 depend differently on @xmath1 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , due to the @xmath8-dependence of the effective mass of the composite fermions .    in nmr experiments",
    "@xcite , the spin polarization at filling factor 2/3 has also been investigated . a remarkably abrupt transition from a fully polarized state to a state with polarization 3/4",
    "has been detected when decreasing the magnetic field .",
    "this has been interpreted as a first order quantum phase transition . for filling factors higher than 2/3",
    ", a strong depolarization has been observed that has been associated with two spin flips per additional flux quantum . in these measurements ,",
    "the system has been tuned via tilting the magnetic field such that the composite fermions are subject to an in - plane magnetic field which only influences the zeeman splitting .",
    "the nature of the collective states under the conditions of the fqhe including the effect of the electron spin has been addressed in recent works .",
    "for instance , several spin polarization instabilities have been found by assuming the tilted field geometry @xcite .",
    "related to the above described optical data , a non - translationally invariant charge density wave state of composite fermions has been proposed in the basis of of restricted hartree fock calculations @xcite . from exact diagonalizations of a few interacting particles , a liquid of non - symmetric excitons has been suggested for explaining the experiments @xcite .",
    "it appears that these suggestions do not exhaust the many possibilities of treating the effective interactions between the composite fermions and of explaining the spin polarization features .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to attempt different approaches .",
    "to explain one of these is the main purpose of the present paper .",
    "in the following chapter , we provide an introductory overview of the idea behind the model of composite fermions .",
    "we show that the main feature of the fqhe , namely the fractional quantization of the hall conductance at fractional filling factors , can be understood for spin polarized systems once the fundamental idea of  attaching flux quanta  to a charged particle has been accepted . in the third chapter , we consider the specific case of half filling and explain how the formal theory of the chern - simons gauge transformation can be formulated for particles including their spin degree of freedom . in the fourth chapter ,",
    "we calculate the propagators of the gauge field fluctuations that are needed in order to understand the effective interaction between the composite fermions .",
    "we find two contributions , symmetric and antisymmetric in the gauge fluctuations , that behave differently in the small - frequency and long - wavelength limit . in chapter five",
    "we calculate the propagators of the composite fermions and establish the self - consistent equations for the self - energies . in the sixth chapter the dyson equation for the composite fermion propagator is solved and in the seventh chapter the self - consistent equation for the energy gap is derived .",
    "a qualitative understanding of the idea behind the model of composite fermions can be gained by considering first the aharonov - bohm effect . consider a particle with elementary charge @xmath9 moving in the vector potential @xmath10 @xmath11 that corresponds to a localized aharonov - bohm magnetic field at position @xmath12 pointing into the @xmath13-direction ( unit vector @xmath14 ) @xmath15 the corresponding stationary schrdinger equation is ( light velocity @xmath16 ) @xmath17^{2 } \\psi({\\bf r})=e\\psi({\\bf r})\\ ] ] ( @xmath18 effective mass of the charge ) .",

    "the above argument is completely independent of the spin of the charged particle since the starting hamiltonian does not couple spin and charge and the gauge vector potential does not generate a magnetic field at the position of the charge , @xmath32 .",
    "the argument is also not changed if an external magnetic field @xmath33 is introduced .",

    "the above consideration may be generalized as follows .",
