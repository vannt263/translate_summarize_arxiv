    "it is well known that the velocity dispersion of stars in the solar vicinity increases with stellar age .",
    "this is called the age  velocity dispersion relation ( hereafter avr ) . @xcite and",
    "@xcite were the first to investigate the association between stellar velocity dispersion and spectral types , and then they discovered this relation .",
    "subsequent observations @xcite confirmed the existence of the avr with much larger samples . according to these observations , this relation",
    "is well fitted by a single power - law function for both the radial ( @xmath0 ) and vertical ( @xmath1 ) directions : @xmath2 where @xmath3 represents @xmath0 or @xmath1 and @xmath4 is the age of the star . the power - law index , @xmath5 , is @xmath6@xmath7 with certain errors ( see table 8 of @xcite ) .",
    "the index for the radial direction is slightly smaller than that for the vertical direction .",
    "however , it is not clear whether this difference is real or not .",
    "@xmath8 has also been ascertained by observations @xcite .    some secular heating processes and/or time evolution in the disk play crucial roles in establishing the avr ( e.g. , @xcite for reviews ) , since the older stars tend to have larger velocity dispersions .",
    "there are a number of scenarios for the origin of the avr : heating by giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ; @xcite ) , by transient spiral arms @xcite , by the combination of gmcs and spiral arms @xcite , by halo black holes @xcite , or by minor mergers @xcite . until now",
    ", there has been no consensus about the primary source of the avr . in table",
    "[ tab : avr : theory ] , we summarize the theoretical predictions of velocity dispersions in both the radial and vertical directions .",
    "all of the above processes are key features of galaxy formation .",
    "thus , understanding the origin of the avr is essential in order to advance our understanding of galaxy formation .",
    "figure [ fig : avr_reso ] shows the radial and vertical avrs of two simulations : one is obtained by our simulations with the fiducial parameters ( model a ) and the other employs the larger gravitational softening length ( @xmath9 ) and lower star - formation thresholds ( @xmath10 ) that are widely used in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation ( model b ) . table [ tab : models ] shows parameters of the two models .",
    "it is apparent that the avrs with the low thresholds are quite different from those obtained by our fiducial model ; for instance , the zavds for both radial and vertical directions are different . the low threshold density for star formation decreases the radial zavd while it increases the vertical zavd .",
    "the former is due to the lack of high - density structures , and the latter is due to the relatively thick star - forming region in the gas disk ( see @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , the heating rate in the radial direction is almost identical to that of the reference simulation while that in the vertical direction is quite different from that of the reference simulation .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy in the vertical direction is the larger zavd .",
    "figure [ fig : origin_reso ] shows the evolution tracks of different groups for the low - resolution model . in particular , the evolution tracks of the vertical direction are quite different from those in the reference model ( see figure [ fig : avr : evolution2 ] ) .",
    "the adoption of star - formation thresholds , which are justified by high mass resolution , is critical to any discussion of the formation and evolution of the avr .",
    "we will show the results of the systematic survey of the numerical effects on the avr in a forthcoming paper .",
    "so far , we have worked with a very simplified model ; for instance , there is no gas accretion , and the fixed halo and stellar potentials are used .",
    "we need to improve our model and make it more realistic so that we can discuss the long - time evolution of the avr in more detail and can measure the contribution of spiral arms and the bar . the contribution of the spiral arms to the avr may turn out to be limited .",
    "previous studies have suggested that transient , recurrent ( so - called ` dynamic ' ) spiral arms lead to radial migration and it does not increase the radial velocity dispersion significantly @xcite .    as a next step",
    ", we will introduce the effects of gas accretion to our model . by investigating the relation between the accretion history and the avr , it might be possible to impose constraints on the milky way - like galaxy formation .",
    "the gaia era is approaching .",
    "the gaia will provide information about the proper motions of about one billion stars @xcite . by combining it with other observations , such as the rave @xcite , apogee @xcite , segue @xcite , and gaia - eso survey @xcite",
    ", we will be able to depict the fine structure of the milky way galaxy .",
    "our model can be tested by the results of this new generation of observations .",

    "<S> observations of stars in the the solar vicinity show a clear tendency for old stars to have larger velocity dispersions . this relation is called the age - velocity dispersion relation ( avr ) and it is believed to provide insight into the heating history of the milky way galaxy . here , in order to investigate the origin of the avr , we performed smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations of the self - gravitating multiphase gas disks in the static disk - halo potentials . </S>",
    "<S> star formation from cold and dense gas is taken into account , and we analyze the evolution of these star particles . we find that exponents of simulated avr and the ratio of the radial to vertical velocity dispersion are close to the observed values . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the simulated avr is not a simple consequence of dynamical heating . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution tracks of stars with different epochs evolve gradually in the age - velocity dispersion plane as a result of : ( 1 ) the decrease in velocity dispersion in star forming regions , and ( 2 ) the decrease in the number of cold / dense / gas as scattering sources . </S>",
