    "methods based on the use of effective energy density functionals ( edfs ) @xcite currently provide the only set of theoretical tools that can be applied to all bound atomic nuclei but the lightest ones in a systematic manner irrespective of their mass , isospin , and deformation .",
    "one underlying assumption is that of a universal effective energy functional that depends on normal and anomalous one - body density matrices and that re - sums the in - medium correlations whose details are irrelevant for low - energy nuclear structure physics .",
    "nuclear edf methods coexist on two distinct levels . on the first level , that is traditionally called self - consistent mean - field theory , hartree - fock ( hf ) or hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) , a single product state provides the normal and anomalous density matrices that enter the edf .",
    "we call this type of method a single - reference ( sr ) approach . exploiting the concept of symmetry breaking as a consequence of the nuclear jahn - teller effect @xcite , collective correlations that correspond to multipole deformations or superfluidity can be easily modelled at the expense of losing good quantum numbers . on the second level ,",
    "often called `` beyond - mean - field methods '' , symmetry restoration and configuration mixing can be achieved within the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) framework .",
    "such method is referred to as a multi - reference ( mr ) approach @xcite .",
    "the mr techniques aim at the explicit description of correlations that are related to the small finite size of the nucleus and that neither can be easily absorbed into the edf , nor be described by a single sr state .",
    "typical examples are the mixing of different shapes that coexist in a nucleus or the restoration of symmetries that are broken at the sr level . besides describing correlated ground states",
    ", the mr approach also gives access to excited states and transition moments between them taking selection rules into account .",
    "multi - reference techniques based on energy density functionals rely on the extension of the edf to non - diagonal energy kernels .",
    "the generalised wick theorem @xcite provides the formal framework when the edf is defined as the expectation value of a genuine hamilton operator .",
    "the energy functionals widely used in nuclear physics , however , are not of this form .",
    "we denote these as `` general functional '' in what follows . the standard procedure for the mr extension of such general functionals",
    "is made by formal analogy with the hamiltonian case , cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "it has been pointed out a few years ago that the usual procedure to set up the non - diagonal kernels of a general edf is ill - defined @xcite .",
    "it gives rise to spurious contributions to the energy that can manifest themselves for example through divergences and/or finite steps when plotting the symmetry - restored energy as a function of a collective coordinate @xcite .",
    "it also makes mr calculations return non - zero energies when restoring _ negative _ particle numbers  @xcite .",
    "these difficulties can be traced back to a breaking of the pauli principle when setting up the edf . in one way or the other , this is the case for all modern parametrisations of the nuclear edf .",
    "it is motivated either by phenomenology or for computational reasons @xcite .",
    "one popular choice for a general nuclear edf is historically based on two- and three - body contact pseudo - potentials proposed by skyrme @xcite . in the earliest adjustments of its coupling constants for nuclear edf calculations",
    "it was used as a genuine hamilton operator .",
    "this gave rise to three major problems in the resulting parametrisations : ( i ) the incompressibility @xmath0 of homogeneous symmetric infinite nuclear matter ( inm ) was unavoidably much larger than the empirical one ; ( ii ) fits that constrain other inm properties such as isoscalar effective mass @xmath1 , saturation density @xmath2 and symmetry energy coefficient @xmath3 to empirical values provided parametrisations that were unstable in the spin channel as indicated by the landau parameter @xmath4 being smaller than @xmath5 @xcite , and ( iii ) pairing matrix elements were far too small or even repulsive .",
    "problem ( ii ) could be circumvented reinterpreting the contact three - body force @xmath6 as a density - dependent two - body force @xmath7 \\ , \\delta ( { { \\mathbf{r}}}_1-{{\\mathbf{r}}}_2)$ ] with , where @xmath8 is the isoscalar density and @xmath9 the spin - exchange operator , respectively , which alters the so - called `` time - odd '' part of the functional that governs the effective spin - spin interaction .",
    "problem ( i ) could then be solved by reducing the exponent @xmath10 from 1 to values between about @xmath11 and @xmath12 . and",
    "for most parametrisations of the skyrme edf , problem ( iii ) was removed by using different vertices in the particle - hole and particle - particle channels that were independently adjusted to data .",
    "in addition , some specific terms in the edf are often suppressed or approximated to simplify the numerical treatment  @xcite . in the past",
    "this has led to high - precision parametrisations of the skyrme edf that kept a relatively simple form  @xcite and were numerically efficient , at the expense of sacrificing the exchange symmetry of the edf .",
    "other variants of the nuclear edf have been set - up directly through their energy density without any reference to an underlying effective interaction  @xcite .",
    "the breaking of the exchange symmetry that results from this practice introduces what is known as spurious `` self - interaction '' in density functional theory for condensed matter  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the same problem in the context of effective interactions as used in nuclear physics has been given in ref .",
    "a similar spurious `` self - pairing '' appears when the normal and pairing parts of the edf are not derived from the same effective interaction as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , divergences and steps in mr edf calculations originate from unphysical weights such self - interaction and self - pairing contributions are multiplied with .",
    "based on this analysis , a regularisation scheme that modifies those ill - defined weights while keeping the self - interaction itself has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and applied with success to the case of pure particle - number projection in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "not all general functionals are regularizable , though .",
    "the formalism can be applied only to functionals that correspond to polynomials in the density matrices @xcite .",
    "parametrisations of a general regularizable skyrme - type edf of minimal form have been constructed recently @xcite and are currently used to test the regularised mr edf scheme for general configuration mixing . constraining the edf to polynomial form makes its fit more difficult .    in parallel",
    ", we also started the construction of functionals that are free of spuriosities from the outset by setting them up as the expectation value of a genuine skyrme - type hamilton operator taking all exchange and pairing terms into account such that the pauli principle is obeyed . by construction",
    ", this removes all spurious contributions to the edf at the price of having less independent terms in the edf . in what follows ,",
    "we denote such functionals a `` pseudo - potential generated edf '' .",
    "this replaces the problem of how to set up a formalism for the extension of a general and flexible edf to non - diagonal kernels for mr calculations by the problems of what is the most efficient form for a predictive pseudo potential that can be straightforwardly used in mr calculations and how to adjust it to data .",
    "this is a difficult task , as a pseudo - potential - based functional has much less independent coupling constants than a general functional of the same form . to be usable in sr and mr calculations incorporating pairing correlations",
    ", it is mandatory that the functional gives a reasonable description of the spin and pairing channels of the interaction . otherwise the level sequence after angular - momentum projection is likely to be unrealistic .",
    "however , the difficulty to have even the correct sign of the interaction in these two channels has been among of the major motivations to abandon skyrme - type pseudo - potential - based edfs in favour of the general ones in the 1970s .",
    "the aim of this contribution is to present the first explorative steps towards the construction of a predictive pseudo - potential based edf .",
    "we present the adjustment of a parametrisation that achieves an acceptable qualitative description in all channels of the interaction by adding three- and four - body contact terms without gradients to a standard two - body skyrme operator .",
    "it will serve to benchmark mr edf calculations and as a reference for what can be achieved without introducing derivatives in the new terms .",
    "the pseudo - hamiltonian used in the present work takes the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the kinetic energy operator and @xmath15 the coulomb interaction , which take their standard form .",
    "the @xmath16 are the @xmath17-body parts of the skyrme - type pseudo - potential for which we consider here the form    [ eq : skyrme_int : pseudo_potential ] @xmath18    where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are unknown coupling constants , @xmath24 denotes the spin exchange operator , @xmath25 is the dirac distribution , @xmath26 is the vector of pauli spin matrices and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the incoming and outgoing relative momenta . the three - body and",
