    "the units interact directly or through disturbances propagated in the medium .    in systems of biological interest , conservative forces ( and thermal fluctuations ) are complemented by non - conservative forces .",
    "realizations of active matter in biology are thus manifold and exist at different scales .",
    "some of them are : bacterial suspensions  @xcite , the cytoskeleton in living cells  @xcite , or even swarms of different animals  @xcite .    clearly enough ,",
    "active matter is far from equilibrium and typically kept in a non - equilibrium steady state .",
    "the difference between active matter and other driven systems , such as sheared fluids , vibrated granular matter and driven vortex lattices is that the energy input is located on internal units ( _ e.g. _ motors ) and therefore homogeneously distributed in the sample . in the other driven systems just mentioned , the energy input occurs on the boundaries of the sample .",
    "moreover , the effect of the motors can be dictated by the state of the particle and/or its immediate neighborhood and it is not necessarily fixed by an external field .",
    "the dynamics of active matter presents a number of interesting features that are worth mentioning here .",
    "active matter displays out of equilibrium phase transitions that may be absent in their passive counterparts .",
    "the dynamic states display large scale spatio - temporal dynamical patterns and depend upon the energy flux and the interactions between their constituents .",
    "active matter often exhibits unusual mechanical properties , very large responses to small perturbations , and very large fluctuations  not consistent with the central limit theorem .",

    "quite independently , passive systems with complex out of equilibrium dynamics have been the focus of much attention too .",
    "these are systems with competing interactions between their constituents  and no external energy input  that in some conditions  such as sufficiently low temperature or high density  can not equilibrate with their environment . a regime ( or phase ) with glassy properties then occurs . in the last two decades or so , a rather complete mean - field theory that describes , up to a certain extent , the super - cooled liquid and deep glassy regime , developed  @xcite",
    "keywords are  mode - coupling theory  and the `` random first order phase transition scenario '' .",
    "this has been complemented with extensive molecular dynamic simulations of microscopic models with interactions between their constituents that are as realistic as possible  @xcite .",
    "simulations have shown agreement with certain aspects of the theoretical approach , especially the ones that will be of interest in this paper .",
    "an important outcome of such theoretical modeling of glassy systems , later confirmed with numerical simulations , is the generation of an effective temperature , @xmath0 , in super - cooled liquids driven out of equilibrium and glasses in relaxation  @xcite .",
    "the concept of effective temperatures in out of equilibrium systems , as arising from deviations from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt )  @xcite , appeared in studies of dynamical systems  @xcite and it was later extended and developed in the field of glassy systems  @xcite .",
    "it was here fully appreciated that @xmath0 should be understood as a time - scales dependent parameter and that it takes a thermodynamic meaning in systems with slow dynamics only  @xcite .",
    "it was later proven that in systems with sufficiently slow dynamics  reaching a regime of small entropy production  the same values of the effective temperature are obtained with a variety of other measurements .",
    "experimental measurements of @xmath1 in different glassy systems , including glycerol  @xcite , spin - glasses  @xcite , polymer samples  @xcite , granular matter  @xcite , laponite  @xcite and other colloidal suspensions  @xcite have been performed .",

    "the validity of fdt in the vicsek model was investigated in  @xcite . in the latter paper a dynamic measurement , similar to one of the calculations we present below , was performed .    in  @xcite",
    "we took a first step in the direction of analyzing the structure and dynamics of active matter with molecular dynamics numerical methods .",
    "we studied the dynamics of an ensemble of self - propelled particles in contact with an equilibrated thermal bath , a reasonable model for real but simple active matter , such as bacterial colonies .",

    "in particular , we show how to measure the effective temperature by using techniques that have already been exploited in the study of the mechanical properties of real biological systems .",
    "the idea is to mimic real experiments which probe mechanical properties of the embedding matrix by following the dynamics of tracer particles ( see , among many others , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , both free and driven by external fields , _ e.g. _ , optical tweezers .",
    "we demonstrate that these techniques can be useful to obtain a direct characterization of the out - of - equilibrium state , and allow for the determination of an effective temperature .",

    "many complex biological systems are constituted of elongated fibrillar structures ( filaments )  @xcite . although one could expect to use the well - established polymer theory to describe such systems , this theory focuses on the limits of completely flexible or totally rigid polymers  @xcite and most biologically relevant polymers or filaments are in neither of these classes .",
    "they rather belong in a third intermediate category : the one of semi - flexible filaments with persistence and contour lengths  @xcite of comparable magnitude .",
    "the contour length of these filaments is too small for them to form loops and knots , yet they are sufficiently flexible to have significant thermal bending .",
    "these problems are much harder to deal with analytically  @xcite and , surprisingly enough , relatively little numerical work has been done so far . in this paper",
    "we start filling this gap by presenting molecular dynamics simulations of a simple but sufficiently realistic model mimicking the behavior of semi - flexible ( or semi - rigid ) polymers in interaction .",
    "we consider a model of a ( passive ) semi - flexible polymer in which the components have the shape of filaments .",

    "the actual choice for the parameters @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath39 allows one to control the flexibility of the chains , ranging from semi - rigid to flexible chains  @xcite .",

    "i.e. _ , the chain is semi - rigid , for @xmath42 .",
    "a preliminary remark about the implementation of realistic molecular motors in a coarse - grained computer simulation study is obvious : no simple technique is able to take into account chemical activity in a molecular dynamics calculation . having this in mind ,",
    "particular care and physical insight has been put in the choice of a reasonable model for motor action on a particular monomer , say the @xmath2th in the @xmath3th chain , that we call @xmath43 .",
    "only a fixed fraction of polymers are provided with motors .",
    "this choice is mainly due to the requirements that motor activity : i ) should be homogeneously distributed in the sample ; ii ) should have a gentle but still detectable out - of - equilibrium effect on the behavior of the system ; iii ) should stay in the linear response regime .",
    "following symmetry considerations , we chose to localize the non - conservative polymer activity at the core of the filament , _ i.e. _ , we motorized the very central monomer in the polymer only . note that , in general , this position does not coincide with the center of mass of the filament and , most importantly , it is fixed .",
    "this situation is clearly at variance with the case of real systems , where molecular motors are able to slide along the filaments  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we do not consider this a serious limitation to our approach , since we follow the dynamical behavior of the system on limited time scales over which motor activity can be indeed taken as localized .",
    "also , we average our results over a substantial number of different instances of motor realizations , mimicking in an indirect way motor motion relative to the filaments . a typical isolated flexible polymer configuration studied is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : polymer ] .",
    "similar to the case of self - propelled spherical particles  @xcite , we mimic the motor effect with a time series of random isotropic kicks , generated by a suitable stochastic process controlled by three parameters : i ) the number of motorized polymers ; ii ) the intensity and direction of the motors forces ; and iii ) the activation time scale . during @xmath44 steps of the molecular dynamics trajectory ,",
    "independent forces are applied to a fraction of randomly chosen motorized central monomers .",
    "the strength of the force exerted , @xmath45 is the same for all motors and is chosen to be a fraction of the mean conservative mechanical force acting on the equivalent passive system , @xmath46 .",

    "we focus on _ adamant _",
    "@xcite motors , _",
    "i.e. _ their action is completely independent of the structural rearrangements they induce .      in a nutshell , given a model for the interaction forces between the different coarse - grained units forming a physical system , the technique of molecular dynamics simulation  @xcite provide effective methods to numerically integrate the equation of motion , conforming to different statistical ensembles and macroscopic external conditions .",
    "it has been utilized for some decades now , to explore structural and dynamical properties of complex systems and it has been shown to perform quite successfully also in the case of polymer systems  @xcite of interest here .    in what follows",
    "we express all quantities in dimensionless reduced units : length , energy and time - units are @xmath34 , @xmath33 and @xmath48 , respectively  @xcite .",

    "this technique produces realistic configurations of the system , characterized by probability distributions conforming to the canonic nvt ensemble .",
    "we calculated statistical averages over several independent instances of the dynamics and we indicate them with angular brackets , @xmath56 .",
    "we used a cubic simulation box of total volume @xmath57 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the parameters in the interaction potentials are : @xmath58 ( the elastic constant ) , @xmath59 ( the equilibrium spring length ) and @xmath60 .",
    "we simulated @xmath22 chains formed by @xmath21 monomers each .",
    "the total number of interaction sites is @xmath61 and the number density @xmath62 is given by the ratio @xmath63 .",
    "the actual values for @xmath21 and @xmath22 have been fixed by some preliminary runs on the passive system detailed in the next section .",
    "we performed some preliminary simulations to select the best suited values of the remaining parameters , @xmath22 and @xmath21 in the limit in which the motors are switched off ( passive system ) .",
    "we observe that the total number of interaction sites , @xmath64 , is limited by our present computer capabilities , mainly due to the need of vast statistics .",
    "we first consider a system with @xmath65 polymers ( a safe trade between the need for minimizing finite size effects and available computational resources ) and values for @xmath21 ranging from 5 to 101 , to select the optimal polymer size .",
    "the wanted number density @xmath62=1 is set by appropriately scaling the simulation box size .",
    "the target temperature , @xmath66 , corresponds to a safe liquid state .",
    "this choice of density and temperature has two important consequences .",
    "first , the passive system is in a liquid state characterized by relaxation times that are much shorter than the typical simulation total time scale and it is comfortably in equilibrium with its environment .",
    "therefore , averages of quantities that depend on only one time ( after preparation ) are time - independent and two - time correlations depend on the time - delay between the measurement of the two observables . more precisely , the dynamics are stationary .",
    "second , the chosen thermodynamical point is well inside the stable liquid phase for the passive system .",
    "this allows us , in the active case , to safely assign any non - conventional structural or dynamical feature to the motor activity alone and not to some `` normal '' effect due to the interaction with some phase boundary .",
    "we start by quantifying the polymer size dependence of the structure of the system . in fig .",

    "the first one is usually related to inter - chains average distance and is at @xmath76 .",
    "the length associated to this value is about 1.26 which , as we will see below , is the typical distance between monomers pertaining to nearest neighbor polymer chains .",
    "the second peak , at position @xmath77 is associated to the equilibrium bond distance @xmath37 .",
    "the feature of small intensity located at about @xmath78 is not associated to any evident length scale , being probably due to the convolution of density fluctuations of wave vectors between @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "subsequent peaks , not shown in the figure , have less intensity reflecting the loss of spatial correlation in the liquid  @xcite .",
    "we note that the general shape of our curve is very similar to the one found in a united atoms model of 1,4-polybutadiene ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in contrast , and as expected , @xmath75 is quite different from the one for highly flexible polymers modeled by a bond - spring model with lennard - jones interactions complemented by the finitely extensible non - linear elastic potential  @xcite .",

    "@xcite demonstrated the breakdown of the fdt , and thus confirmed that a hair bundle s spontaneous movements are produced by energy - consuming elements within the hair cell .    in  @xcite the fluctuation - dissipation relation in a model cell system formed by three fundamental components ( myosin ii , actin filaments , and cross - linkers ) was studied in equilibrium and out - of - equilibrium conditions .",
    "fdt holds in the former and fails in the latter situation . in these papers ,",
    "the violation of fdt was used as a proof of the non - equilibrium character of the dynamics induced by molecular motors .",
    "the effective temperature stemming from deviations from fdt has been used to study the stability of motorized particles in cytoplasm  @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , values of @xmath0 that are lower than the ambient temperature were found when considering motors that are aware of the free - energy landscape and act only in the direction of lowering its instantaneous value .",
    "the motors used in our study are not of this kind and the values of @xmath0 obtained are consistently higher than the ambient @xmath12 .",
    "such an `` inversion '' also occurs in cases in which the initial configuration is chosen to be to be one of equilibrium at a lower @xmath12 than the working one  @xcite .    a simple birth - death process and a general two - species interacting process , as simplified models of gene networks , were studied from the effective temperature perspective in  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper was to propose to use @xmath0 as a means to distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic noise sources .",
    "morozov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied a model of the cytoskeletal network made of semi - flexible polymers subject to thermal and motor - induced fluctuations , modeled as either additive or multiplicative colored noise .",
    "they found violations of the conventional fdt leading to a @xmath0 that exceeds the thermodynamic temperature @xmath12 only in the low - frequency domain where motor agitation prevails over thermal fluctuations .",
    "this is consistent with our numerical findings .",
    "however , @xmath0 in this phenomenological model is continuously frequency dependent while our data suggest that there is a low frequency regime in which it reaches a constant value , as in glassy systems .",
    "fluctuation - dissipation ratios were used to extract information about the degree of frustration , due to the existence of many metastable disordered states , in two self - assembly processes : the formation of viral capsids , and the crystallization of sticky discs  @xcite .",
    "et al_.  @xcite used numerical techniques to study the non - equilibrium steady state dynamics of a heated crystalline nanoparticle suspended in a fluid .",
    "a two - temperature scenario holds in this case .",
    "indeed , by comparing the mobility to the velocity correlation function , fdt approximately holds at short - time lags with a temperature value that coincides with the kinetic one .",
    "in contrast , at long - time lags data are compatible with the temperature estimated by using the einstein relation .",
    "ben - isaac _ et al . _",
    "@xcite analyzed the langevin dynamics of a single particle randomly kicked by motors as a toy model of active matter .",
    "they focused on the deviations of @xmath0 from @xmath12 and the distribution of velocities from gaussian as parameters that quantify the out of equilibrium nature of the dynamics , finding that while the former is robust the latter is not .",
    "comparison to measurements in atp - driven red - blood cells is also provided in this paper .",
    "finally , let us sum up the results in the experimental work of palacci _",
    "et al_.  @xcite that is , indeed , the closest to our work .",
    "these authors investigated the effective temperature by following perrin s analysis of the density profile in the steady state of an active colloidal suspension under gravity .",
    "the active particles used ",
    "janus particles  are chemically powered colloids and the suspension was studied with optical microscopy .",
    "the measurements show that the active colloids are hotter than in the passive limit with an effective temperature that increases as the square of the parameter that controls activation , the peclet number , a dependence that is highly reminiscent of the @xmath203-dependence we found with our simulations .",
    "this summary proves that there is an increasing activity in the study of fdt violations and their interpretation in terms of effective temperatures in biophysics problems",
    ". a comprehensive experimental study of the thermodynamic properties , as we tried to present in this work within one system is , however , still lacking . in our opinion",
    "the active colloidal suspension used in  @xcite appears as the most suitable experimental system where to deal with this kind of questions .",
    "let us now critically review our findings .",
    "we presented a study of active matter made of semi - flexible filaments in interaction . in the passive limit",
    "the conservative interaction parameters put the system in a liquid phase .",
    "the equilibrium polymer melt has , though , properties that are different from the ones found in the limits of completely rigid or totally flexible polymers . for example , the individual chains are not gaussian .    under the action of mild motor forces , the structure and dynamics are significantly modified .",
    "the analysis of the chain radius of gyration suggests that the polymers become more compact for increasing forces .",
    "this is consistent with the behavior of thermodynamic quantities that suggest crowding under increasing forces . on the other hand",
    ", the study of the static structure factors suggests that the melt gets more disordered as in a passive sample in contact with hotter baths and that chains become more folded when @xmath113 increases . as a consequence , the dynamics gets faster under stronger forces .",
    "this is shown by the fact that the relaxation time , as extracted from the evolution of the incoherent scattering function , decreases , while the diffusion coefficient increases , for increasing @xmath113 .",
    "next , we developed an in - depth study of the effective temperature of the active system , by using a number of independent measurements .",
    "the results of all these measurements in the semi - flexible polymer sample , as well as the outcome of similar measurements in the self - propelled point - particle model we analyzed in  @xcite , are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : teff - final ] .",
    "the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath113 conforms to our intuition .",
    "we dealt with motors that act randomly  and ignore their effect on the energy landscape of the system .",
    "they have the effect of disordering the sample and , consequently , the stronger @xmath113 the higher @xmath0 . in their study of point - particle active matter",
    "@xcite , shen and wolynes argued that motors that act selectively , only when they contribute to decreasing the system s free - energy density , lead to out of equilibrium dynamics with lower effective temperature than the environmental one .",
    "the interpretation is that this kind of motor orders the sample more than the passive system would be in equilibrium at the working bath temperature . a similar inversion has been observed in relaxing passive systems driven from an ordered initial equilibrium condition to a point in parameter space in which the evolution slowly tends to reach a less ordered final equilibrium state  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "the dynamic configurations are also more ordered than the target equilibrium ones and , as a consequence , their effective temperature is lower than the one of the bath .    the results discussed in this paper and in ref .  @xcite",
    "give a different perspective on the dynamics of active matter than the coarse - grained hydrodynamic descriptions  @xcite .",
    "while in the mode - coupling study in  @xcite a strong frequency dependence of the effective temperature was found , in our simulations the behavior observed is , in contrast , very similar to the one advocated in  @xcite to be the one of interacting glassy - like systems evolving in a small entropy production limit . indeed , the global behavior of @xmath1 in the active matter polymer system resembles the one computed in a variety of atomic models in the glassy regime  @xcite , sheared super - cooled liquids  @xcite , driven vortex systems  @xcite or even vibrated granular matter  @xcite .",
    "independent measurements of @xmath1 yield consistent results in the atomic and molecular cases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : teff - final ] , giving support to the idea that @xmath1 can be considered to be a thermodynamic object , at least in the weakly driven cases studied here ( @xmath204 ) .",
    "it would be interesting to test whether a similar phenomenology arises in lattice models of vicsek - type  @xcite with various independent measurements of @xmath0 yielding the same result .",
    "on the experimental front , it would be welcome to extend the analysis of @xmath0 in the dilute active suspension of artificial swimmers studied in  @xcite or search for @xmath0 in artificial samples such as the ones recently designed for their tunability  @xcite .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to explore the possibilities offered by the approach described in this work to clarify the extremely complex phenomenology of cell mechanical stability  @xcite .",
    "in particular , one could try to give an answer to the question as to how mechanical properties like elastic moduli change with motor activity and whether these changes can also be rationalized in terms of the effective temperature .",

    "<S> we follow the dynamics of an ensemble of interacting self - propelled semi - flexible polymers in contact with a thermal bath . we characterize structure and dynamics of the passive system and as a function of the motor activity . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the fluctuation - dissipation relation allows for the definition of an effective temperature that is compatible with the results obtained by using a tracer particle as a thermometer . </S>",
    "<S> the effective temperature takes a higher value than the temperature of the bath when the effect of the motors is not correlated with the structural rearrangements they induce . </S>",
    "<S> our data are compatible with a dependence upon the square of the motor strength ( normalized by the average internal force ) and they suggest an intriguing linear dependence on the tracer diffusion constant times the density of the embedding matrix . </S>",
    "<S> we show how to use this concept to rationalize experimental results and suggest possible innovative research directions . </S>"
