    "srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 is an experimental realization of a spin 1/2 antiferromagnet living on the two - dimensional ( 2d ) shastry - sutherland lattice ( ssl ) .",
    "its properties can be well described with the heisenberg model : @xmath2 where @xmath3 ( resp .",
    "@xmath4 ) is the exchange within ( resp . between ) dimers .",
    "the experimental compound has a ratio @xmath5 slightly above  @xcite 0.6 .",
    "the ssl has been first introduced theoretically as an example of a 2d antiferromagnet whose ground - state for small enough @xmath6 is exactly known  @xcite : it is simply the product of singlets on each dimer up to  @xcite @xmath7 .",
    "indeed , experiments on srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 indicate a finite spin gap . for larger @xmath6 ,",
    "a more usual 2d nel - ordered phase is stabilized , possibly with an intermediate plaquette phase .",
    "previous raman experiments on this compound  @xcite indicate that some structure in the spectrum can only be explained by taking into account a realistic model , including for instance dzyaloshinski - moriya ( dm ) interactions  @xcite . however , these dm terms are too small to have any sizeable effects on the low - energy raman spectra  @xcite discussed here and thus will be neglected hereafter",
    ". our goal will be to show that , within a simple heisenberg model , doping non - magnetic impurities generates new spectroscopic signatures below the 2-magnon continuum whose features should persist in a more realistic model .",
    "@xcite     signs correspond to raman coupling in the @xmath8 polarization case . ]",
    "srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 is a mott insulator and its doping with mobile carriers is predicted to lead to superconductivity  @xcite . in this paper , we shall rather consider the controlled doping of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 with non - magnetic _ static _ impurities such as zinc or magnesium atoms substituted for copper atoms on a very small fraction of the @xmath9 lattice sites .",
    "such atoms acting as vacant sites provide accurate local real - space probes ( which can be considered as independent for low enough impurity concentration ) .",
    "as known in strongly correlated systems , a small doping of the parent compound can bring crucial informations about its intrinsic properties  @xcite . substituting cu with non - magnetic mg impurities",
    "has been recently performed  @xcite .",
    "neutron scattering experiments  @xcite have then shown the appearance of new magnetic excitations into the singlet - triplet gap . here , we shall focus on raman spectroscopic techniques which , by probing @xmath10 excitations using light scattering , offer a unique way to identify the local response to a doped impurity .",
    "in particular , we will show that transitions between different s=1/2 bound - states can be identified in the raman spectra .",
    "such features can be interpreted within a simple phenomenological model describing the attractive potential between a liberated spinon and the impurity ( vacant site ) .",
    "the theory of raman light scattering is most simple when the photon energy is much smaller than the mott gap .",
    "in such a case , it is legitimate to use the loudon - fleury approximation and the raman operator reads : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the polarization vectors of the incoming and scattered light , and @xmath14 is the unit vector connecting two sites @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this operator only couples to zero - momentum singlet excitations . in principle , the coupling constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 could depend on the exchange values  @xcite , although such a dependance is neglected in most studies .",
    "however , some simplifications occur for an @xmath8 polarization ( see fig .  [ lattice.fig ] ) : indeed , in this case , the geometry of the compound implies that only the @xmath4 bonds contribute to the raman operator .",
    "moreover , the dominant intensity occurs when triplets can be created on dimer bonds which , in contrast , is not allowed in @xmath19 polarization  @xcite . in the following , we will restrict to this polarization where all raman coupling constants are equal up to a sign ( given in fig .",
    "[ lattice.fig ] ) .    at zero temperature ,",
    "the raman intensity is given by the dynamical correlations of the raman operator : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the ground - state ( gs ) of the system and the sum runs over the excited states @xmath22 with energy @xmath23 .",
    "note that because of the symmetry of the raman operator , only singlet states with zero momentum contribute .",
    "moreover , in the chosen polarization , only states which are odd with respect to reflections along @xmath24 or @xmath25 axis give a signal .      as studied in ref .",
    ", the raman spectrum of the undoped material shows 4 sharp peaks at 1.25 , 1.9 , 2.3 and 2.9 times the spin gap @xmath26 .     on @xmath27 and @xmath28 clusters .",
    "the spin gap @xmath26 ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 in ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively ) is used as a unit of frequency .",
    "an artificial width @xmath32 has been given to the delta peaks.,title=\"fig : \" ]   on @xmath27 and @xmath28 clusters .",
    "the spin gap @xmath26 ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 in ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively ) is used as a unit of frequency .",

    "the spin gap @xmath26 ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 in ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively ) is used as a unit of frequency .",
    "an artificial width @xmath32 has been given to the delta peaks.,title=\"fig : \" ]    naively , one would expect the raman spectrum to start at the 2-magnon continuum ( i.e. twice the spin gap ) since it is a singlet operator .",
    "in fact , a singlet bound state made of 2 triplets does exist on this lattice  @xcite and was identified as the low - energy state  @xcite .",
    "the first two peaks are attributed to two - triplet bound states , while the 2 others are interpreted in terms of three - particle excitations .",
    "although the high - intensity peaks are above the 2-magnon continuum ( starting at @xmath33 ) , the very small magnon dispersion leads to a very narrow continuum so that the two higher - energy peaks are observable .    in fig .",
    "[ pure ] , we present our exact diagonalizations spectra for various @xmath6 .",
    "as expected , for small @xmath6 , the finite - size effects are rather weak due to the large energy scales ( i.e. short correlation lengths ) , so that results are almost identical on @xmath27 and @xmath34 clusters . clearly , spectral weight is present below the 2-magnon threshold . on the other hand , for larger @xmath6 ,",
    "finite - size effects become sizeable so that a direct comparison with experimental values is difficult . however",
    ", one can still notice spectral weight well below the 2-magnon continuum , corresponding to the above mentionned singlet bound states .",
    "note also that , for @xmath34 , the first peak is located at an energy @xmath35 as seen in experiments .",
    "we now turn to the doped case for which additional low - energy states appear .",
    "we shall assume a small enough impurity concentration so that a single impurity description becomes legitimate .",
    "using a variational approach , el shawish and bona  @xcite have proposed anisotropic spin - polaronic states with a finite spatial extension around the impurity . adding a single impurity ( i.e. creating a vacant site by removing a spin ) indeed generates a polarization 1/2 that will distribute around the impurity . on fig .",
    "[ pattern.fig ] , we show the gs magnetization pattern computed exactly on a @xmath34 cluster with one impurity .",
    "the local polarization oscillates from one site to the other similar to the friedel oscillations reported around a localized triplet in the 1/8 plateau  @xcite .",
    "note however that each strong dimer has a global positive polarization .",
    "our results are in good agreement  @xcite with the gs variational estimate of ref .  .",
    "these authors have also found low - energy states appearing below the undoped spin gap .",
    "since these states are well localized , we expect that finite - size calculations can provide accurate results for these excitations as well .",
    "in particular , we expect a much better accuracy than in the pure case .",
    "ssl for @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used .",
    "since the reflection around the @xmath25 axis is still a good symmetry , we observe identical values on both sides . ]",
    "the existence of several @xmath38 low - energy states has led to various experimental signatures : by flipping spins , they can be observed in neutron experiment  @xcite ( which is sensitive to @xmath39 transitions ) ; moreover , since these states can be connected by @xmath10 transitions , they are also expected to be raman active , which is the main purpose of our study .",
    "[ doped ] shows the raman spectra obtained by exact diagonalizations on @xmath27 and 32 clusters with one impurity for various @xmath6 .",
    "the spectra are plotted as a function of @xmath40 , where the spin gap of the pure sample @xmath26 is very close to the spin gap @xmath41 in the doped cluster ( both computed on the largest cluster ) . in the small @xmath6 regime ,",
    "all energy scales are well separated and finite - size effects are negligible so that one can understand all features . for the pure system , as discussed above , there is a bound - state below @xmath33 and then another peak at @xmath33 corresponding to a singlet excitation made of two distant triplets . since the triplets have a small dispersion , there is no continuum above . in the presence of a single impurity",
    ", these features still represent much of the spectral weight but , in addition , new peaks appear below the spin gap .",
    "namely , one can make a singlet excitation by creating a triplet in the bulk while flipping the polarization cloud ( so that the number of such peaks scales as the number of dimers @xmath42 ) .",
    "moreover , there is a possibility to form a bound - states of these two excitations , which can even lower the energy below the spin gap ( see fig .",
    "[ doped ] ) , as found numerically .",
    "another feature of this additional spectral weight is that it scales with the concentration of impurity , i.e. is reduced by @xmath43 when doubling the system size .    in order to be more quantitative , we compare these bound - state energies with the variational results of ref .",
    "[ ] for @xmath44 where the two lowest @xmath45 states have excitation energies @xmath46 and @xmath47 , while the undoped spin gap is @xmath48 . in our exact calculations on @xmath34 cluster for the same @xmath6 , we find that the three lowest excitations have a total spin 1/2 and are located at 0.217 , 0.245 and 0.268@xmath49 , while the spin gap is @xmath50 in good agreement with these variational results , except that we have an additional low - energy state .",
    "concerning their raman signatures , one has to discuss their symmetry properties : in the presence of a single impurity , the translation symmetry is lost and only one reflection along dimers ( i.e. along @xmath24 or @xmath25 ) remain .",
    "since the raman operator is odd with respect to this reflection , a simple inspection at the odd / even character of these excited states allow to determine if they are / are not raman active . in fig .",
    "[ effective.fig](a-b ) , we have indicated all even and odd @xmath51 states below the first @xmath52 state on @xmath27 and @xmath28 clusters . a careful comparison with the raman spectra does confirm that only states with @xmath51 and which are odd w.r.t . reflection give raman peaks at low energy .",
    "on @xmath27 and @xmath28 clusters .",
    "the spin gap @xmath26 ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 in ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively ) is used as a unit of frequency .",
    "an artificial width @xmath32 has been given to the delta peaks.,title=\"fig : \" ]   on @xmath27 and @xmath28 clusters .",

    "interestingly , a phenomenological description of these bound - states can be given similarly to the case of doped quasi-1d",
    "cugeo@xmath1  @xcite . for @xmath53 , a free @xmath45 ( spinon )",
    "is located next to the vacant site , on the broken dimer bond .",
    "switching on @xmath4 allows this spinon to delocalize with a hopping term of order @xmath54 .",
    "however , each time the spinon hops one dimer away from the impurity , a strong bond is broken resulting in an additional `` string '' energy cost @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , the physics is similar to a particle in a linear potential and bound - states can occur .",
    "of course , when the string energy exceeds the spin gap , the whole picture breaks down and the spinon can `` escape '' in a flat potential by the spontaneous creation of a spinon - antispinon pair out of the vacuum .",
    "we have considered this effective quantum mechanical model on an effective square lattice for one particle allowed to hop with amplitude @xmath56 on its neighboring sites ( except between the impurity dimer and the neighboring dimer facing the vacant site ) , and with a potential energy equals to @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the manhattan distance from the impurity dimer .",
    "this one - particle problem can be easily solved on large clusters and its spectrum is presented on fig .",
    "[ effective.fig](c ) . for vanishing @xmath4 ,",
    "the low - energy s=1/2 spectrum is extensively degenerate : the @xmath42 triplets of excitation energy @xmath3 located on the remaining bonds can be combined with the impurity spin in total s=1/2 states ( degenerate with their s=3/2 counter - parts not described by the model ) .",
    "the next set of states which appears at energy 2j ( corresponding to 2 isolated triplets ) and above are also not described by the effective model .",
    "switching on @xmath4 lifts the degeneracy of the first group of @xmath59 s=1/2 states resulting in a rich spectrum well described by the effective model for which the @xmath60 limit can be taken .",
    "common features are observed both in the microscopic and the effective models such as ( a ) bound - states due to the short - range string - like part of the potential and ( b ) a continuum of s=1/2 excitations above the spin gap ( given in fig .",
    "[ effective.fig](a-b ) by the lowest s=3/2 state ) .",
    "in fact , the estimation of the spin gap from high - order perturbation  @xcite , @xmath61 , agrees very well with the ed value obtained on the largest @xmath34 cluster up to @xmath36 and with the effective model up to @xmath62 . for small @xmath6 ,",
    "the number of bound states below the spin gap is four : in the effective language , it corresponds to a spinon delocalized on one of the nearest - neighbor dimers of the impurity dimer .",
    "the situation for larger @xmath6 is less clear as many states go down , possibly with stronger finite - size effects on ed data .",
    "still , our numerical data would be compatible with up to 12 bound - states , some of them being very close to the spin gap .",
    "however , with our choice of polarizations and due to the selection rule , only odd states are raman active , which gives 2 ( resp .",
    "6 ) low - energy states for @xmath63 ( resp .",
    "@xmath64 ) .    .",
    "the dashed line indicates the perturbative estimation of the spin gap ( see text ) .",
    "( a - b ) microscopic model on @xmath27 and @xmath28 ssl .",
    "the states are classified according to their reflection symmetry .",
    "the two lowest s=3/2 states also shown give the onset of the continuum .",
    "( c ) effective model ( see inset for a schematic plot of the effective potential ) on a @xmath65 square lattice of dimers for which finite - size effects are not visible . ]",
    "to finish , we quickly address the case of a finite impurity concentration for which a two - impurity effective interaction starts to operate .",
    "since each impurity will create a spin 1/2 polarization around it , it is natural to expect some ordering , possibly at low temperature .",
    "for instance , antiferromagnetic ( af ) ordering occurs in doped cugeo@xmath1",
    "@xcite and has been predicted for cav@xmath66o@xmath67  @xcite .",
    "one can imagine an effective diluted spin 1/2 model with a very small exchange interaction ( typically , the overlap between two polarization clouds is exponentially small when the impurities are quite far ) , and such a model is expected to order at low - temperature .    in order to estimate the effective coupling constant between two impurities at site @xmath68 and @xmath69 , we start from the formula @xmath70 .",
    "now , @xmath71 , where the expectation value is calculated in the triplet state with two impurities . choosing the polarization along @xmath72 , and in order to get an estimate , we can approximate the expectation value by @xmath73 .",
    "we further approximate the polarization of a given site as the sum of the polarizations coming from the two impurities , which would be true to first order in perturbation , leading to @xmath74 where @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) is the average magnetization created at site @xmath15 by a single impurity located at @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the same appromixation for the correlation functions of @xmath77 leads to the same terms with the same sign for the 1 - 1 and 2 - 2 terms , and opposite signs for the 1 - 2 and 2 - 1 terms .",
    "the 1 - 1 and 2 - 2 terms will drop from the difference , leading to the formula : @xmath78 from the polarization shown in fig .",
    "[ pattern.fig ] , the resulting effective exchange can be obtained by considering various configurations of two impurities .",
    "our results ( data not shown ) indicate that , when both impurities are located on vertical dimers , the effective interaction decreases very fast and is mostly af .",
    "since these bonds belong to the same sublattice , the presence of strong frustration can prevent magnetic ordering . on the contrary ,",
    "when both impurities are located on different dimer types ( one vertical and one horizontal ) , the effective interaction is mostly ferromagnetic , thus competing with the af and often resulting in a disordered state .",
    "anyhow , if magnetic order occurs , it would be at a temperature much below the effective energy scale , which is already quite small .",
    "this argument can be generalized to an arbitrary distribution of impurities . in conclusion , we predict the absence of magnetic ordering , even for quite large doping and at extremely low temperature , which seems compatible with experiments  @xcite .",
    "in summary , doping a shastry - sutherland lattice with non - magnetic impurities leads to novel low - energy states below the spin gap , that could be probed by raman spectroscopy .",
    "we have proposed a simple effective model to understand bound - state formation as binding of a spinon to an impurity site . for a particular polarization of light ,",
    "some of these bound - states are raman active with sizeable spectral weights : 2 of these bound - states are located well below the continuum ( and exist for any @xmath79 ) , while up to 4 more bound - states could be observed for realistic parameters . moreover , since the effective interactions between impurities is frustrated , we expect no magnetic ordering down to extremely low temperature .",
