    "black holes are truly interesting objects in general relativity but not free from problems . in particular",
    ", the information loss paradox@xcite is a long standing question without a definitive answer .",
    "it has been shown that one can not hold on to general relativity , semi - classical quantum field theory , area - entropy relation , and unitarity all at the same time @xcite .",
    "although there are several proposals with their own share of issues@xcite , here we tackle the information loss paradox from the euclidean path integral approach and the wave function of the universe@xcite . there , one sums over all possible geometries and configurations , formally given by @xmath0}\\ , ,          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] but in practise one can not deal with the whole path integral .",
    "nevertheless , there is an interesting proposal by maldacena @xcite and hawking @xcite who argued that if one of those histories has a trivial topology , i.e. no horizon nor singularity , then information is conserved in the whole wave function .",
    "however , a classical observer who sees a definite geometry experiences an _ effective loss of information_. in this work , we construct concrete examples supporting this point of view . although one can not build them in general",
    ", we show that there is a wide range of parameters that allow such configurations .",
    "we have in mind the picture of a star collapse , where a stable star suffers for any reason a phase transition and undergoes gravitational collapse , perhaps forming a black hole .",
    "we model this behaviour within the thin shell formalism and look for a stationary bubble solutions . to do that a simple tension does not suffice and",
    "thus we modify it at high energies regime to obtain the desired solution .",
    "the idea of this work is as follows . as schematically shown in figure [ fig:1 ] , we want to build a stationary bubble , as much as a toy model for a star collapse with a regular interior , which the final geometry , black hole or expanding shell , is due to semi - classical effects .",
    "thus , in section [ shell ] we review the thin - shell formalism , in section [ stationary ] we build a stationary thin shell solution and discuss the implications to the information loss paradox . finally , in section [ conc ] we summarize and conclude our work .",
    "blue curve in the left hand side , tunnels into a black hole , right - down , or expands to infinity , right - up .",
    "those two outcomes are possible and hence the final state is a combination of two geometries . ]    by virtue of israel junction conditions @xcite one can glue two solutions of einstein equations , allowing for a thin shell which accounts for any jump of the extrinsic curvature at the junction . in particular , assume a spherically symmetric system where the metric is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 refer to outside ( @xmath3 ) and inside ( @xmath4 ) the shell , @xmath5 is the mass parameter and @xmath6 is the ads radius",
    ". then the junction condition yields @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the tension of a perfect fluid thin shell and @xmath9 is the sign of the extrinsic curvature out / inside respectively . on top of",
    "that we have the conservation of energy , relating surface energy density @xmath8 and pressure @xmath10 , which given a constant equation of state @xmath11 leads us to @xmath12 with this simple set of equations one can find very interesting examples@xcite . in most cases though , a simple choice of the tension yields only two possible outcomes ; collapse or expansion . in the next section we show some sufficient requirements for the tension so as to obtain a stationary thin shell or bubble . before that , let us remind the reader that the situation gets more interesting when semi - classical effects come into play@xcite .           one can grasp a more physically intuitive picture by rewriting the junction condition eq . as a particle with zero energy moving in a 1-d potential , that is@xcite : @xmath13 this form is particularly useful to understand the dynamics of the thin shell with radius @xmath14 . for example , for true vacuum bubbles in an ads background with a constant tension,@xcite",
    "the potential generally takes the form as in the left side of figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "it is easy to see that the shell either unavoidably collapse or expands .",
    "now , if our model parameters have a region with @xmath15 , we have two classically disconnected regions . on one hand ,",
    "the shell starts from @xmath16 , expands , bounces and collapses back to @xmath16 . on the other hand ,",
    "the shell starts from @xmath17 , collapses , bounces and expands .",
    "however , as it is well know from quantum mechanics , a particle can cross a classically forbidden region by a quantum tunnelling . in our case , the thin shell can tunnel,@xcite for example , from an expanding solution from @xmath16 to an expanding solution to @xmath17 , with a exponentially suppressed yet non - vanishing probability .",
    "the main drawback of the latter example though , is that the shell starts from a white hole at @xmath16 and thus one could question its initial conditions .",
    "for this reason , let us modify the latter example and look for an stationary bubble as an initial condition , see right of figure [ fig:2 ] .    before ending this section ,",
    "let us recall that the sign of the extrinsic curvature dictates the location of the thin shell in the penrose diagram .",
    "we require the extrinsic curvature to be positive for @xmath14 larger than the outer horizon so as to be located at the right hand side of the diagram .",
    "this is ensured by requiring @xmath18 , as one can see from recovering the signs of the extrinsic curvature , that is @xmath19 we show this requirement as a blue line in all forthcoming plots .",
    "and the approximate behaviour in each zone is written in red .",
    "black lines are @xmath20 , black dotted for a constant tension and black curve for the modified behaviour @xmath21 .",
    "any crossing with the blue line indicates a change in the extrinsic curvature sign .",
    "the parameters of this plot are as follows ( @xmath22 ) : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . ]",
    "let us intuitively explain how the tension @xmath8 should behave at high energies ( small @xmath14 ) regime so as to achieve a classically stable configuration .",
    "for this purpose , it is useful to count the number of zeros in the effective potential , by ploting the junction condition eq . setting @xmath29 , rather than the effective potential form .",
    "for example , for an ads true vacuum bubble one generally obtains the behaviour shown in figure [ fig:3 ] .",
    "notice that for a constant tension , which corresponds to the black dotted line , we obtain two intersections with the red line and , therefore , the potential has two zeros and takes the form of left figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "now , we want to modify this solution so as to obtain four zeros in the effective potential . in other words",
    ", we want four intersections with the red line in total . from figure [ fig:3 ]",
    ", it is readily seen that the tension must be steep enough in order to overcome the @xmath30 behaviour of the red line curve .",
    "we choose to add stiff matter with an equation of state @xmath31 , which leads to a @xmath32 behaviour of the tension .",
    "see the black line in figure [ fig:3 ] .",
    "this is obviously not the only possibility but the simplest modification , as far as we understand .",
    "the same procedure can be applied in the case of a thin shell in a minkowski background , although one must tune more the tension@xcite .",
    "in particular , we use : @xmath33 + 1\\right ) & \\quad \\bar{r}<\\bar{r}_m              \\\\              \\frac{1}{6}\\left(\\tanh\\left[\\mu_2\\left(\\bar{r}-\\bar{r}_2\\right)\\right ] + 1\\right ) & \\quad \\bar{r}>\\bar{r}_m          \\end{array }          \\right . ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively control the steepness and position of the transition , and @xmath38 is the matching radius in an intermediate region .",
    "one can easily find a parameter region where three or four zeros are obtained and , therefore , find a stationary solution .",
    "a concrete example is shown in figure [ fig:4 ] .    , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "on the right hand side we chose : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47.,title=\"fig : \" ] , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . on the right hand side we chose : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47.,title=\"fig : \" ]    so far we showed examples of stationary bubbles , which we think of a toy model of a star collapse .",
    "now , it is time to discuss the implications to the information loss paradox .",
    "in fact , one can numerically compute the probabilities@xcite and find that the probability of tunnelling into a black hole is exponentially higher than the probability to tunnel to an expanding shell .",
    "still , the latter is non - vanishing and therefore there is a path in the whole wave function of the universe where the information is recovered .",
    "that implies that a classical observer who sees a definite geometry , the most probable one , finds an _ effective loss of information_.",
    "we studied the information loss paradox in the context of euclidean path integrals . using the thin shell formalism , we built classically stable stationary bubbles .",
    "we showed the existence of such examples for true vacuum bubbles in asymptotically flat and ads backgrounds and also in minkowski spacetime .",
    "they could be thought of as a toy model of a star collapse .",
    "afterwards , we considered that such bubbles are not stable under quantum effects and eventually they tunnel , mediated by instantons , either to a collapsing shell that forms a black hole or to an expanding shell that expands all the way to infinity . in terms of the wave function ,",
    "the final geometry is a composition of two possible final states .",
    "however , a classical observer only sees a definite geometry and , most likely , finds a black hole configuration since it is exponentially favoured with respect to the expanding solution .",
    "thus , a classical observer might find an effective loss of information , while the whole information is encoded in the wave function of the universe .",
    "although our work is based in a collection of examples , we want to emphasise that in such cases the role of semi - classical effects in solving the information loss paradox is essential . it might be helpful , for example , in cases such as eternal black holes or extremal charged black holes .",
