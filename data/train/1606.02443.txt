    "recently hawking , perry , and strominger ( hps ) @xcite @xcite proposed an interesting scenario that may resolve the information loss problem @xcite .",
    "they suggest that quantum information about collapsing matter is stored in an infinite number of conserved noether currents having asymptotic symmetries , including supertranslation on a horizon .",
    "this is expected to maintain the unitarity of quantum gravity , and all of the information may be accessible in the region outside of the horizon . by incorporating superrotation symmetry on a horizon ,",
    "this symmetry - based scenario may also provide a possibility of revealing the statistical mechanical origin of the bekenstein  hawking entropy @xmath0 , as already pointed out in previous papers @xcite and @xcite by one of the authors of this paper .",
    "the nonvanishing holographic charges of these asymptotic symmetries can yield a huge number of different physical states with the same adm energy and angular momentum .",
    "the degeneracy is so large that it may account for the order of @xmath0 @xcite .    in holographic charge arguments ,",
    "the physical degrees of freedom emerge from would - be gauge degrees of freedom of the general covariance .",
    "this can be grasped easily by recalling the poincar covariance as a simple example .",
    "in fact , the lorentz transformation is a subgroup of the poincar group and generates an infinite number of physical states with different values of the momentum .",
    "the poincar transformation is a subgroup of general coordinate transformations .",
    "because general relativistic theories have the general covariance as the gauge symmetry , the poincar transformation can be regarded as a would - be gauge transformation , which actually causes a transition between physical states . on a horizon , a similar mechanism works , and an infinite - dimensional asymptotic symmetry appears .    in the spirit of brown and henneaux @xcite ,",
    "strominger first suggested in @xcite that a three - dimensional black hole entropy is derived using a virasoro algebra as an asymptotic symmetry at spatial infinity .",
    "carlip @xcite proposed an asymptotic virasoro symmetry on a black hole horizon and argued that the black hole entropy is derived using the cardy formula with a macroscopically large central charge .",
    "however , the original argument of carlip encountered various types of criticism @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite and remains controversial .",
    "the existence of supertranslation and superrotation as a consistent asymptotic symmetry on a stationary horizon of a four - dimensional schwarzschild black hole was first reported in a paper @xcite by one of the authors of the present paper .",
    "subsequently , it was explicitly demonstrated that falling matter really excites charged states of the asymptotic symmetry in a three - dimensional black hole spacetime @xcite .",
    "it is not known yet whether a gravitational wave excites charged states of supertranslation and superrotation on a horizon .",
    "hps recently revisited supertranslation and superrotation on the horizon @xcite @xcite by using a different coordinate system from that in @xcite and @xcite .    using a coordinate system ,",
    "hps introduced asymptotic metrics near a horizon as @xmath1 where the horizon is located at @xmath2 and uppercase roman letters run over spatial coordinates on the horizon .",
    "based on the above form , hps argue that stationary black holes do not carry classical supertranslation hair because the holographic charge vanishes in the classical level @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the coordinate system in eq .",
    "( [ 001 ] ) covers both regions inside of the horizon and outside of the horizon , and can be physically implemented by free - falling block - numbered clocks distributed in the space near the horizon , as depicted in the left panel of figure 1 . because of the clock free motion , it is very natural from the viewpoint of equivalence principle that nonzero holographic charges on the horizon can not be observed .",
    "apart from hps s setup , if we adopt a rindler - type coordinate system in which an asymptotic near - horizon metric is given by@xmath3 where @xmath4 is rindler acceleration and the horizon is located at @xmath5 , we indeed have nonvanishing classical holographic charges on the horizon even for stationary black holes @xcite . the coordinate system in eq .",
    "( [ 002 ] ) is implemented by accelerating block - numbered clocks distributed in the space near the horizon , as depicted in the right panel of figure 1 .",

    "( right ) a coordinate system implemented by accelerating block - numbered clocks distributed in the space near the horizon . in this coordinate system ,",
    "non - zero classical holographic charges @xmath6 $ ] appear on the horizon as soft black hole hair even for stationary black holes .",
    "the appearance of the charges in the accelerated coordinate system is reminiscent of that of a thermal bath in the unruh effect .",
    ", height=207 ]    as in the black hole complementarity scenario @xcite , the hps scenario requires some mechanism to avoid the no - cloning paradox .",
    "if all of the information about collapsing matter is stored in the conserved charges on the horizon , we may make a precise copy of the quantum information of the matter inside of the horizon by using the charge information .",
    "although this  naively seems to contradict the no - cloning theorem of quantum mechanics @xcite , hps have not yet provided any plausible resolution of this paradox .",
    "let us consider the gravitational collapse depicted in the left panel of figure 2 .",
    "in this scenario , information about the collapsing matter is imprinted in the holographic charge states of asymptotic symmetries on the horizon .",
    "if we throw additional matter into the black hole , as depicted in the right panel of figure 2 , a new horizon appears and encloses the old horizon",
    ". then new holographic charge states have to carry all of the information about the original collapsing matter and additional matter .",
    "naively , this appears strange .",
    "the new holographic charges must remember quantum information about the behavior of the original collapsing matter before the additional matter arrived .",
    "thus , we potentially have duplicate quantum information about the collapsing matter on the two different horizons .",
    "this challenges the no - cloning theorem again .",
    "this situation remains unchanged even if we take a large mass limit on the black hole . in this limit , the near - horizon geometry is merely a minkowski spacetime , and each horizon coincides with one of the rindler horizons .",
    "the situation is depicted in figure 3 .",
    "thus , even if a linearized theory of quantum gravity is considered in a minkowski background with rindler horizons , the no - cloning problem should be resolved properly .",
    "this implies that the investigation of holographic charges on rindler horizons is valuable .            to analyze the above problems of asymptotic rindler spacetimes , we construct a general theory of gravitational holographic charges for a ( 1 + 3)-dimensional linearized gravity field in section 2 of this paper .",
    "although matter crossing a rindler horizon generates horizon deformation and a time - dependent coordinate shift , that is , gravitational memory , the charges of supertranslation and superrotation on the horizon can be defined during and after its passage through the horizon . in particular",
    ", it is verified that the charges become time - independent after matter absorption by the horizon .",
    "it should be emphasized that the time independence of the charge is very nontrivial for a general coordinate transformation .",
    "for instance , a noether current for an infinitesimal coordinate transformation @xmath7 is given in einstein gravitational theory by @xmath8 and is locally conserved : @xmath9 .",
    "the charge @xmath10 is defined by the integration of @xmath11 in a bulk region @xmath12 as@xmath13 even though @xmath9 holds , the time independence of @xmath10  is not generally ensured .",
    "this is because the surface integral of the flux @xmath14 does not disappear for many @xmath15 even if we have no gravitational wave and matter on the surface . from the local balance relation of conserved currents ,",
    "@xmath16 @xmath10 can vary in time because the right - hand side of the above equation is generally nonzero .",
    "thus , for a surface of interest such as a horizon , the time independence of the holographic charges has to be checked independently by confirming that @xmath9 . in section 2 ,",
    "we show the time independence of the holographic charges on rindler horizons . a general formula for conserved holographic charges after the horizon absorbs the matter is provided .",
    "it is also proven that holographic states on the horizon can not store any information about absorbed perturbative gravitational waves . to show the memory effect of horizons , a measure of the classical gravitational memory @xmath17 on a future horizon at @xmath18 with a rindler wedge located at @xmath19",
    "is introduced by time integration of the holographic charges .",
    "it differs from the standard gravitational memory that appears in @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite and provides a more profound insight because it consists of conserved charges .    in section 3 ,",
    "we introduce a quantum gravitational memory operator @xmath20 for a rindler horizon and propose a possible resolution of the no - cloning paradox from the viewpoint of quantum measurement contextuality .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of quantum matter inside of a horizon does not commute with @xmath21 on the horizon .",
    "this also leads to noncommutativity between holographic charges of different horizons .",
    "thus , a measurement of @xmath21 on a horizon affects other @xmath22 and quantum states of matter inside of the horizon .",
    "they are not independent observables , and the reality of @xmath21 is subject to the contextuality of quantum measurement . on the basis of this fact , we propose a conjecture that the holographic charge reality is conditioned to measurements by appropriate physical detectors .",
    "then no cloning paradox arises , at least in the first order of perturbative quantum gravity . in a method similar to that of unruh  dewitt particle detectors @xcite @xcite for unruh radiation in a rindler spacetime , physical detectors accumulating information for evaluation of a quantum metric near the horizon may observe the holographic charges as a reality . owing to gravitational interaction between infalling matter and the metric detectors distributed in the space , the detectors share quantum entanglement with the matter inside of the horizon .",
    "if we place no detector to measure the quantum metric near the horizon , the absorbed matter is not decohered by the measurement .",
    "all of the quantum information about the infalling matter remains carried by the matter itself .",
    "hence , the holographic noether charges are not physical objects that share  quantum entanglement with the matter inside but merely a gauge freedom of general covariance in this case .",
    "therefore , even in quantum theory , the horizon can not be regarded as a real holographic screen spanning the space in the absence of measurement devices .",
    "this conjecture avoids the no - cloning paradox and also supports a conservative conjecture for the information loss problem in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , which is quite different from that in the firewall conjecture @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the natural units are adopted : @xmath23 .",
    "in this section , we construct a general theory of gravitational holographic charges for a weak gravity field .",
    "first , a useful gauge condition , referred to as the rindler gauge , is introduced for an arbitrary configuration of the field .",
    "next , using the rindler gauge , a regge  teitelboim canonical theory is formulated for holographic charges on a rindler horizon .      using the gravitational constant @xmath24 , let us introduce the planck length constant @xmath25 .",

    "a naive guess would be that it is impossible . because asymptotic symmetry on a horizon appears owing to the background metric isometry",
    ", it is natural to expect that a large departure from the background metric no longer has any symmetry and breaks the integrability of holographic charges for no specific reason . in section 3 , we proposed a conjecture to resolve the no - cloning paradox between infalling matter and holographic charges .",
    "if the reality concept of holographic charges is abandoned , no paradox occurs .",
    "the holographic charges are merely an emergent concept , and near - horizon metric measurement devices make observations as if the charges had some reality via entanglement between matter inside of the horizon and the detectors .     as a discussion",
    ", an interesting question can be posed .",
    "do hawking ",
    "unruh particles in realistic gravitational collapse , which propagate toward null future infinity , act as a metric detector near the horizon ?",
    "it is certainly true that the mode functions of the particles flush through a near - horizon region early in the gravitational  collapse .",
    "then do the particles store any information about events on the horizon ?",
    "the possibility that the particles remember such information has been seriously discussed for a long time by many researchers , especially by t hooft @xcite and page @xcite . however , in the minkowski background with a rindler horizon , the hawking ",
    "unruh particles observed by unruh  de witt particle detectors seem to completely forget the information on the horizon .",
    "for instance , let us consider an aichelburg  sexl shock wave @xcite passing through a rindler horizon .",
    "initially , the quantum fields of the hawking  unruh particles are in the minkowski vacuum . after the shock wave passes , the quantum states of the fields are not excited and remain the vacuum state because the lorentz invariance of the spacetime prohibits particle creation by the shock wave .",
    "this means that no information about the shock wave is stored in the quantum fluctuation of the fields .",
    "thus , the hawking ",
    "unruh particles observed later also remember nothing about the shock wave .",
    "contrary to the expectation of hps @xcite , the information loss problem seems to remain elusive even if we take account of the asymptotic symmetry on the horizon , although it may reveal the statistical mechanical origin of the bekenstein  hawking entropy .",
