    "the effects of quantum coherence of electrons appear . under the right circumstances",
    "some electrons in the ring are able to preserve its coherence which in turn results in a persistent ( dissipationless ) equilibrium current induced by the static magnetic field . in 1965",
    "bloch @xcite and five years later kulik @xcite confirmed hund s theory using the quantum - mechanical description .",

    "al @xcite where the existence of the persistent currents was shown also in the presence of the elastic dispersions .",
    "first measurements of currents in the diffusive regime @xcite have shown rather strong disagreement ( 10200 times larger currents amplitudes ) with the theoretically anticipated values .",
    "later attempts reduced this dissimilarity to a factor of around 2 - 3 @xcite .",
    "experiments with semiconducting materials in the close to ballistic regime usually agreed with the theory @xcite .",
    "only recently the scanning squid technique was used to record not only the response signal of the rings itself but also from the background .",
    "this method gave the possibility of the high precision measurements of the current flowing in 33 different separate gold rings @xcite and finally confirm qualitatively as well as quantitatively all aspect of the existing theoretical descriptions @xcite .",
    "the alternative method was used to measure the currents in the aluminum rings which were deposited on a cantilever @xcite .",
    "a torque magnetometer whose vibration frequency can be precisely monitored was used as a detector .",
    "the measurements was performed with the several different cantilevers decorated with a single aluminum ring or arrays of hundreds or thousands of identical aluminum rings .",

    "[ ci ] we depict the response of the metallic ring to the applied constant magnetic flux in the classical smoluchowski regime ( i.e. for @xmath118 ) .",
    "it is worth to stress that the current characteristics for the amplitude @xmath28 and the phase @xmath119 of the transmission coefficient ( top panel , red curve ) represent the situation with maximal current .",

    "the analysis for slightly lower or higher phases shows simple para- or diamagnetic single  periodic structure of current  flux characteristics , respectively .",
    "we now address the issue of whether , and to which extent , the quantum nature of thermal fluctuations can influence transport properties .",
