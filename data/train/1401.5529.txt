    "lmc x3 was one of the first extragalactic x - ray sources to be discovered @xcite .",
    "it was subsequently identified with a b main - sequence star @xcite . with the discovery that the star is in a 1.7-day binary orbit with a massive dark companion , @xmath4 @xcite , lmc x-3 became the first example of an extragalactic stellar - mass black hole .",
    "lmc x3 is an unusual system straddling the boundary between transient and wind - fed black hole binary systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "its global characteristics , however , show that its mass transfer is governed by roche - lobe overflow , which places it with the transients .",
    "although it exhibits extreme x - ray variability , spanning roughly three orders of magnitude in luminosity , lmc x3 is unique among the transients because , with a few notable exceptions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it remains in a disk - dominated thermal state ( approximately 90% of the time ) .",
    "in fact , the dominance of the soft thermal component and the relative simplicity of lmc x3 s spectrum are the reasons @xcite and @xcite both chose the source to benchmark the performance of accretion - disk spectral models .",
    "likewise , our group has used the extensive thermal - state data available for lmc x3 to firmly establish the existence of a constant inner - disk radius in black hole binary systems @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have identified two long - duration `` low '' phases , each lasting several months , during which the system was in a hard state .",
    "this unusual behavior is likely related to the well - known variability of the source on long timescales . initially , cowley et al . suggested a superorbital x - ray period of @xmath5 ( or possibly @xmath6 ) days , but subsequent studies of both optical and x - ray variability find a range of superorbital periodicities extending from @xmath7 days @xcite .",
    "there is no stable long period in this source , and the superorbital variability appears not to be attributable to the precession of a warped disk or related at all to the orbital dynamics of the system .",
    "instead , the long - term variability is likely produced by changes in the mass accretion rate ( @xcite ; hereafter b01 ) .",
    "several groups have used the extensive data available for lmc x3 to search for connections between x - ray variability and optical variability .",
    "notably , b01 find that the x - ray and optical light curves are correlated , with an x - ray lag of 510 days , whereas @xcite find a somewhat longer @xmath8-day lag .",
    "a complementary body of work has focused on examining very fast ( @xmath9s ) variability in the hard state for other black - hole binary systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in these systems , a surprising subsecond anticorrelation between x - ray and optical is commonly observed that is unlikely to be related to x - ray reprocessing .",
    "rather , it appears that this behavior is related to the presence of a jet . in the case of lmc x3 , no jet is expected , particularly for the thermal state relevant here .    in the standard @xmath1-disk theory of accretion @xcite ,",
    "one naturally expects the signals between any two wave bands to be correlated with a time delay that corresponds to the viscous time for a parcel of gas to travel from the outer emission region ( longer wavelength band ) in the disk to the inner ( shorter wavelength band ) .",
    "let us consider an annular region with an outer radius @xmath10 and a gap in radius @xmath11 between the two zones that are of interest in this paper , namely , the regions of optical and x - ray emission .",
    "since the smaller radius in this case is negligible compared to @xmath10 , the viscous time for gas with viscosity @xmath12 to traverse the distance @xmath13 is simply , @xmath14    in this paper , we link the optical variability of lmc x3 to its x - ray variability by using a wealth of optical and x - ray data . more specifically ,",
    "we employ two extensive optical / infrared ( oir ) data sets and , in the x - ray band , we combine data collected daily by _ rxte  _ s all - sky monitor ( asm ) with high - sensitivity data obtained in many hundreds of pointed observations using _ rxte  _ s proportional counter array ( pca ) .",
    "our principal oir data set was obtained using the andicam @xcite on the smarts  1.3  m telescope @xcite .",
    "andicam is a dual - channel imager , which we used to obtain pairs of images of lmc x3 in @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , or @xmath18 .",
    "the data were reduced and calibrated with respect to several field stars , as described in @xcite .",
    "the andicam data were supplemented by @xmath15 and @xmath16 data kindly supplied by c.  brocksopp and described in b01 .",
    "these data are a subset from a larger sample obtained using the 0.91  m dutch telescope of the european southern observatory between 1993 and 1999 during a total of 16 different observing runs .",
    "our full data set is derived from 470 , 514 , 476 , and 440 smarts  observations in @xmath19 and @xmath18 , respectively , and 356 and 685 additional eso observations in @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( b01 ) .",
    "we employ just @xmath20 of the b01 data set , because we exclusively consider those data collected after 1996 march 7 ( mjd @xmath21 ) when _ rxte  _  operations entered a mature phase .",
    "our _ rxte  _ x - ray data set is derived from both asm and pca observations .",
    "the calibrated asm data using the full bandwidth ( 212  kev ) and 1-day time bins were retrieved from the website supported by the asm/_rxte _ team .",
    "the pca data , derived from 1598 observations made using the pcu-2 detector , were all reduced and analyzed following closely our standard methods ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but in this case the data were partitioned in somewhat finer time bins , using continuous exposure intervals with a mean of 2  ks ( and range 300s to 5000s ) .",
    "our goal here is relatively modest , namely , to derive reliable estimates of flux and construct an x - ray light curve .    the smarts  oir light curves and the contemporaneous asm + pca x - ray light curve are shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    ", as discussed in ",
    "[ subsection : mdot ] .",
    "the red curve shows our adopted , smoothed light curve.,title=\"fig : \" ]      in order to most fully capture the x - ray variability of lmc x3 , we combine the asm and pca data sets into a single , unified light curve . given the complementary cadence and sensitivity of the two instruments",
    ", this approach results in a light curve that for our purposes is distinctly superior to using only one of the light curves singly .",
    "the method we adopt here for combining the light curves does not critically affect our final results ; e.g. , the character of our results are unaffected if we use the asm data alone .",
    "we choose to standardize the two data sets by determining for each asm and pca observation the mass accretion rate onto the black hole , @xmath22 .",
    "we make this choice because lmc x3 is nearly always in the thermal state , a state in which the stable inner - radius results in a constant efficiency ( depending only on the spin parameter ) , and @xmath22 is therefore simply proportional to the bolometric luminosity emitted by the disk .",
    "the mass accretion rate determined from pca spectral fits can the be compared to the 212  kev pca flux , providing a scaling relationship that is then used to determine @xmath22 values for the 212  kev flux measurements from asm data , which can not be fit for bolometric disk luminosity .",
    "fortunately , when lmc x3 does occasionally enter the hard state its luminosity is so low that @xmath23 is a quite reasonable approximation for the purposes of this study .",
    "we first determine @xmath22 for the pca data by fitting the @xmath24 pcu-2 spectra to a standard disk model that accommodates the presence of a weak compton component . the complete spectral model in _ xspec _ notation @xcite takes the form : tbabs@xmath25simpl@xmath26kerrbb2 ) . the disk component kerrbb2  @xcite fits for @xmath22 using fixed  and here ,",
    "approximate  values for black - hole mass , inclination and distance .",
    "simpl  models the compton power law @xcite and tbabs  the low - energy absorption @xcite .",
    "each pca spectrum thus delivers a value of the accretion rate at the same time , we compute the _ observed _ pca flux @xmath27 from 212 kev relative to the standard flux of the crab in the same band @xcite .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : mdot ] , the relationship between @xmath22 and @xmath27 obtained in this way is well defined and tightly constrained below the curve .",
    "these exceptional spectra show an unusually strong compton component , more than an order of magnitude brighter than is typical for the disk - dominated states of lmc x3 . ] .",
    "we likewise converted the 212 kev asm count rates into fluxes relative to the crab ( 1 crab = 75 asm c  s@xmath28 ) and then interpolated the relationship derived for the pca in order to establish the relation between flux and @xmath22 for the asm .",
    "( to accommodate negative asm count rates , we used an extrapolation of the low - flux pca data rather than adopting a floor value for @xmath22 . )    having established a common scale for the two detectors , we then used the lowess  nonparametric smoothing algorithm @xcite to derive a representation of the true , underlying light curve ( which is at all points locally determined ) . because the errors are grossly different for the pca and asm data , we achieve appropriate weighting via monte - carlo randomization : a lowess  curve fit is derived for each of 1000 random realizations and the median curve",
    "is taken as the most representative fit . here",
    ", we used a third - order lowess  curve fit and adopted a window length of approximately one month , a choice motivated by the x - ray autocorrelation time (   [ section : xcors ] ) .",
    "the precise settings used in fitting the data only affect our results cosmetically .",
    "for example , with a window length of 3 days , we obtained the same - though noisier - results .",
    "1600 pca spectra showing @xmath22 as a function of 212 kev x - ray flux .",
    "the lowess  fit we adopt is overlaid in red .",
    "results for 6% of the full pca sample are omitted from the figure either because the spectral fit used to derive @xmath22 was statistically poor or it provided no constraint on @xmath22.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "with the unified x - ray light curve now in hand ( i.e. , @xmath29 ) , we use the unsmoothed data and examine the relationship between x - ray and oir variability .",
    "specifically , we assess the correlated variability between @xmath22 and the oir bands as a function of time lag using the discrete correlation function ( dcf ) of @xcite , with all observation times referred to the solar system barycenter .",
    "a dcf is derived from a pair of time series , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , by first establishing a set of lags @xmath32 and cross - fluxes @xmath33 , which are calculated across all paired time differences amongst the data : @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the means of series @xmath38 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "similarly , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the standard deviations of @xmath38 and @xmath15 .",
    "the dcf for time lag @xmath32 is then @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number of @xmath43 elements in the bin @xmath32 .",
    "we convert the oir data into fluxes and then standardize all data sets to unity variance and zero mean and then compute a dcf between each oir light curve and the ( unsmoothed ) @xmath22 time series (   [ subsection : mdot ] ) , binning the time lag data into @xmath441  day intervals .",
    "given this sampling and given data that span a decade , correlated variability is discernible over timescales ranging from days to years .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : xcors ] , the x - ray time lag for the strongest features in the cross correlation of @xmath22 with the oir flux in each individual band is @xmath0  weeks",
    ". this value is intermediate between those found by b01 and @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation for the differences is the lag s luminosity dependence discussed in ",
    "[ section : discussion ] .",
    "the lag of the x - ray flux is naturally explained as a consequence of the viscous time delay for a density perturbation to propagate from the outer disk , the location of peak oir emission , to the vicinity of the black hole where the x - rays are produced .    why are the cross - correlation peaks so broad ?",
    "an examination of the x - ray autocorrelation ( figure  [ fig : xauto ] ) suggests an answer .",
    "the autocorrelation timescale over which the x - ray source brightens or dims , several weeks , is similar to the typical lag time of @xmath45  weeks .",
    "this is not surprising given that the timescale for the inner disk to change from faint to bright  the autocorrelation time ",
    "should be commensurate with the time required for a parcel of gas to travel from the outer disk to the center , i.e. , the viscous time .    on longer timescales ,",
    "first at @xmath46 days and @xmath47 days , other features appear in the autocorrelation function ( figure  [ fig : xauto ] ) .",
    "as evidenced by alternating positive / negative harmonic peaks , the anti - correlation feature at 160 days , e.g. , is likely to be at least partially related to radiative or mechanical feedback in the system , whereby periods of strong accretion inhibit the accretion flow onto the outer disk .",
    "this is also evident in the strong anti - correlation signature between oir and x - ray bands at @xmath48d lag ( where the optical behavior now follows after the x - ray ) .    in the next section ,",
    "we develop a model for the accretion - driven , @xmath0  week time lag in the context of a simplistic physical picture of the disk - star system in lmc x3 .    2 week x - ray lag .",
    "random realizations have been used to assess the error for each cross - correlation , which is the source of scruff on the curves .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    -day `` pulse - width '' response of the x - ray light - curve shows that significant changes in the accretion flow require several weeks to materialize .",
    "this timescale is responsible for the breadth of the lag features in fig .",
    "[ fig : xcors ] . errors are shown but are generally comparable to or smaller than the linewidth.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "our purpose is to model the complex oir light curves of lmc x3 as a blend of three components of emission attributable to ( 1 ) the companion star ; ( 2 ) a multitemperature thermal disk ; and ( 3 ) the regions in the disk and star where x - rays are reprocessed .",
    "( we need not consider synchrotron emission here , as there is no evidence for a jet in lmc x3 , unlike many other sources . ) our model for the system is shown schematically in figure  [ fig : schem1 ] .",
    "we approximate the net emission @xmath49 in a given oir band @xmath50 as a sum of the three components : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the oir disk emission which relates to the later x - ray emission ( or @xmath22 ) at time @xmath53 ; @xmath54 is the direct flux from the star plus any steady component of disk light ; and @xmath55 is the reprocessed emission from the outer disk and companion star .",
    "the simplest term , @xmath54 , is a constant plus sinusoidal terms that approximate the asymmetric ellipsoidal variability of the tidally distorted star : @xmath56,\\]][eq : ellipse ] where phase @xmath57 and @xmath58 allow for the difference in the amplitudes of the two minima .",
    "both @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the normalizations respectively of the asymmetric and sinusoidal terms , are free parameters , as are @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .      the connection of the term @xmath52 , the variable oir component of disk emission , to @xmath22 is obvious .",
    "however , @xmath22 was derived for the inner x - ray - emitting portion of the disk , which is located far from the optical - emitting region , and the mass transfer rates may be different in the two regions . therefore , in order to compute the oir disk emission from @xmath22 , our model must include a description of how matter flows from the outer disk to the inner region .",
    "this is established via a transfer function which maps between x - ray and oir regimes .",
    "we envision the disk described with such a model as a series of concentric rings .",
    "the accretion flow for each individual ring is approximately steady - state , but the steady - state solution varies from ring to ring .",
    "the order of the rings are fixed , but they are allowed to stretch or compress in width during inflow .",
    "meanwhile , the observed , viscosity - induced time delay of the x - ray flux relative to the optical will have some dependence on the mass supply of the individual rings . in our generic prescription , we incorporate this dependence as a free power - law scaling on the time delay , which depends on @xmath22 , a choice that is explained further in section  [ section : discussion ] .",
    "we likewise assume that the optical emission has a power - law dependence on @xmath22 : @xmath64^\\beta , \\label{eq : f_lag}\\ ] ] with @xmath65 and @xmath66 as free parameters and @xmath67 is the viscous lag at time @xmath68 , defined as @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are free parameters .",
    "a slightly modified prescription for the accretion emission is considered in appendix  [ section : model2 ] .",
    "finally , we allow for a potential scaling error in our conversion from x - ray flux to @xmath22 by introducing a floating offset @xmath72 which modifies the zero - point of @xmath22 . for simplicity , rather than introducing a new variable ,",
    "@xmath22 will be understood to contain an implicit free zero - point , which is determined in the fit .",
    "the x - ray heating by the central source , which occurs on a timescale of seconds , is treated as instantaneous .",
    "that is , the heating term @xmath73 responds directly to changes in @xmath29 ( zero time lag ) .",
    "we arbitrarily parameterize the dependence of @xmath73 on @xmath22 as a broken power law .",
    "this choice allows for variable shielding by the disk as the x - ray luminosity varies .",
    "the heating term contains two elements : the primary term , which has no orbital phase dependence , describes x - ray heating of the outer disk ; and the secondary term , @xmath74 , describes x - ray heating of the companion star .",
    "@xmath74 depends on phase and is maximum at superior conjunction of the star .",
    "we assume that @xmath74 varies sinusoidally and that its normalization constant @xmath75 is the same for all of the oir bands .",
    "this approximation is valid because for the b - type companion star @xcite the oir bands all lie in the rayleigh - jeans part of the spectrum .    @xmath76    where @xmath77 so that @xmath74 varies between 0 and @xmath78 each orbit , where @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 are fit parameters .",
    "our full model consists of a total of 27 free parameters ( plus two additional calibration parameters to align the b01 and smartsdatasets ) .",
    "there are 16 `` chromatic '' parameters that contain a subscript @xmath50 ( 4 each per oir band ) and there are 11 `` gray '' parameters that are independent of wavelength ( e.g. , the orbital period @xmath63 ) .",
    "correlations amongst the fit parameters are discussed and shown in appendix  [ append : correlations ] .",
    "the model has been implemented in _ python _ and applied at once to the composite oir data set .",
    "all fits are computed using the markov chain monte - carlo ( mcmc ) routine emcee - hammer @xcite in a bayesian formalism . because our model is an oversimplification of complex real processes",
    ", we expect the quality of the fits to be limited by systematic effects .",
    "we therefore adopt 10% and 20% ( systematic ) error bars for the optical and ir data , respectively , and we ignore the much smaller measurement errors .",
    "these round values were chosen by making a preliminary fit to the data and assessing the rms fit residuals . because the uncertainties were estimated in this utilitarian way , any goodness - of - fit statistics -such as @xmath83 - should be interpreted with reserve .",
    "we use a flat prior ( i.e. , uniform weighting ) on the period ; for all other parameters , we use informed priors whenever one is evident .",
    "otherwise , we default to flat priors on the logarithm of normalization terms ( i.e. , scale - independent weighting ) , and flat priors on shape parameters .",
    "the fitting results , which are based on our analysis of all the oir data , are presented in table  [ tab : fits ] .",
    "mcmc directly computes the posterior probability distribution of a model s parameters , but it does not specifically optimize the fit quality . therefore , the best - fitting value of @xmath83 given in table  [ tab : fits ] has been obtained via other standard optimization methods ( e.g. , levenberg  marquardt , downhill - simplex , etc . ) , while taking the mcmc results as a starting point .    to achieve our fits via emcee - hammer",

    "meanwhile , the contribution to the stellar flux due to ellipsoidal variability is @xmath89 ( section  [ subsec : stellarmod ] ) , while the asymmetric term is a factor @xmath90 smaller still .",
    "b01 conclude that the optical variability of lmc x-3 is due to viscous disk emission rather than x - ray reprocessing , i.e. , that reprocessing is of secondary importance .",
    "our results support b01 s conclusion .",
    "our fits indicate that as the x - ray flux varies over its full range that the fraction of stellar light to the total light in both the @xmath15 and @xmath16 bands is @xmath91 . a consistent value of @xmath92 has been derived independently for a wide range of x - ray luminosities using spectroscopic data ( @xcite ) .",
    "the value of the scaling index @xmath93 ( 90% confidence ) , which relates the oir flux to the time - lagged disk emission @xmath22 ( section  [ subsec : diskmod ] ) , may indicate that the rates of inflow at the outer and inner radii are not matched .",
    "if so , the implication is that mass is lost from the body of the disk , especially at high values of @xmath22 .",

    "moreover , the uncertainty in the period determination is a factor @xmath141 worse than achieved using the light curve model .",
    "the intensity of the x - ray heating component in the oir bands is a surprisingly strong function of x - ray luminosity , scaling as @xmath142 , up to a critical value of @xmath143  g / s ( roughly @xmath144 of the eddington limit ) . above this luminosity ,",
    "the heating signal drops off rapidly as @xmath145 such that at the maximum x - ray luminosity ( @xmath146 ) its intensity is a factor of 10 below its peak .",
    "a likely explanation for the initial superlinear rise with luminosity is that the flaring of the disk at higher luminosity increases the solid angle of the reprocessing region , and that this effect dominates over the self - shadowing by the disk . above @xmath147 ,",
    "the shadowing dominates and the heating signal dwindles rapidly .    for the shadowing to be substantial without producing more oir emission than is observed , the flare in the disk s scale height must move inward as the x - ray luminosity increases .",
    "that is , we envision a flared funnel - like region in the inner disk that contracts in around the black hole as luminosity increases and as the flaring becomes more pronounced .",
    "the oir emission from the reprocessing region remains modest , even at the highest luminosities , because the reprocessing excess is relegated to shorter wavelengths and emitted from within a diminished area of the disk .",
    "a prediction of this picture is that the pattern of reprocessing shifting to smaller area and shorter wavelength at growing luminosity should be observable in optical / uv for those low - inclination systems which show substantial luminosity variability .",
    "as viewed from the x - ray source , the star subtends an angle of @xmath148 ( ignoring disk obscuration ) .",

    "can be distinguished from the reprocessed disk emission because the former is modulated at the orbital period . for simplicity ,",
    "the fraction of the total reprocessed emission contributed by the star is treated as a constant , free parameter .      in canonical thin accretion disk theory @xcite , the wavelength of peak emission from the disk scales as @xmath150 , whereas for irradiation - dominated disks the peak wavelength scales roughly as @xmath151 @xcite . on this basis ,",

    "the constancy of the viscous time lag with wavelength implies that the oir signal arises from a single radius in the disk .",
    "this result is incompatible with any simple disk theory for which temperature falls off monotonically with radius , unless one imagines locating the radius of oir emission at the disk s outer edge .",
    "however , the outer edge is obviously ruled by the data because the entire disk would then be so hot that it would outshine the star .      instead , the constancy of the time lag with wavelength is naturally explained by the presence of a `` hot spot '' or similar structure within the outer disk that is bright enough to dominate the oir lag signal .",
    "doppler modulation tomographic maps of accreting binary systems show clear evidence for such features in other sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an excellent example is provided by the map of the black hole binary a062000 , which reveals bright spots embedded in a hot `` ring '' in the disk ( dominated by two large crescent structures ; @xcite ) .",
    "the ring is located at 45% or 60% of the l1 radius ( @xmath155 ) depending on whether one assumes , respectively , a keplerian or ballistic trajectory for the gas stream .",
    "this range in radius exactly brackets the _ circularization radius _ of the system , the radius at which the angular momentum of the tidal stream matches the angular momentum of the gas in the disk .",
    "the circularization radius @xmath156 is located at 50%  @xmath157 for a062000 , while the truncation radius of the outer disk is predicted to be located at @xmath158%  @xmath157 @xcite . a schematic diagram of a system like a062000 is shown in figure  [ fig : schem2 ] .",
    "the temperatures of these bright spots and rings are poorly constrained in quiescent black - hole binaries , and they are essentially unconstrained in active systems . in order to crudely gauge the temperature of such a spot , we look to the recent work by @xcite where for a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) system they have measured @xmath159  k. such hot spots are attributed to shocks produced by the tidal stream of gas from the companion star impinging on the disk .",
    "a strong shock ( mach number @xmath160 ) can result in up to a hundredfold jump in temperature in the post - shock gas .",
    "if the mass flow rate in the stream @xmath161 is sufficiently large , a shock that traverses inward from @xmath162 will eventually stall at the circularization radius @xmath163 . for simplicity , we assume that the flow is purely ballistic , i.e. , that the velocity is unaffected by @xmath161 , and that the hotspot luminosity increases as @xmath161 increases .",
    "we now mention an alternative explanation for the superlinear scaling between oir and x - ray emission ( @xmath164 ) , which in section  [ section : results ] we attributed to disk winds . here , where the oir emission originates in a shock , we instead envision that this nonlinear relationship could plausibly result from changes in the structure or strength of the shock caused by variations in @xmath161 .",
    "the cooling time for the shock - heated gas is negligibly short compared to the viscous timescale .",
    "therefore , the stability and brightness of these structures are related to the instantaneous value of @xmath165 . the ring itself must be relatively narrow owing to the prompt cooling .",
    "the cooled gas relaxes to the disk profile , and then it proceeds inward to the center on the viscous timescale .    the outermost disk is always dominated by gas pressure so that the scale height at each radius is given , roughly , by the ratio of the sound speed in the midplane , @xmath166 , to the keplerian velocity in the disk . using the @xmath1 disk approximation for disk viscosity @xcite , @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the scale height of the disk .",
    "then , @xmath169 and the viscous timescale can be written as @xmath170     and @xmath16 respectively ( see table  [ tab : fits ] ) . _ ( right ) _ oir light curves obtained after removing the heating and disk - emission terms @xmath137 and @xmath136 .",
    "error bars reflect an estimated 20% uncertainty on the accretion `` noise '' which has been subtracted .",
    "a lowess smoothing of the light curve is overlaid on the data in each panel to guide the eye .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]        in what follows , recall that we are approximating the evolving disk as a superposition of independent , steady - state solutions ( section  [ subsec : diskmod ] ) .",
    "we make two other assumptions , which are eminently reasonable : ( 1 ) the disk is strongly illuminated ; and ( 2 ) @xmath161 alone determines the x - ray and oir emission .",
    "building on these assumptions and our measured value of the time lag , we now derive a rough estimate of @xmath1 in the outer disk .",
    "we first consider the conditions in the disk and the location of the oir - emitting hotspots .",
    "the strong x - ray irradiation of the disk will modify its structure at large distances from the central source , i.e. , @xmath171  cm ( @xcite ) .",
    "meanwhile , the midplane temperature , being less sensitive to irradiation , will tend to follow the viscous dissipation profile , @xmath172 . however , the temperature of the irradiated surface layer of the disk will fall off much more slowly , as @xmath173 @xcite , or even as slowly as @xmath174 @xcite . to our knowledge ,",
    "the vertical temperature gradient in strongly irradiated disks has not been given serious consideration .",
    "generally , @xmath175 and @xmath176 in the outer disk , determined from irradiation and viscous dissipation , respectively , are comparable and within a factor of a few of one another , and it is reasonable to approximate the vertical temperature profile as isothermal ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for the average mass accretion rate onto lmc x3",
    ", we estimate for any reasonable set of disk parameters that to within a factor @xmath177 the midplane temperature @xmath178  k at @xmath179 .",
    "for this temperature and radius , using equations  [ eq : alphadisk]-[eq : tviscx ] we find to order of magnitude that @xmath180 .",
    "our result agrees well with other measurements of @xmath1 , particularly those obtained for cvs ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the most reliable of these other measurements , like our estimate for lmc x-3 , were derived for irradiated outer disks .",
    "a surprising outcome of our model and analysis is the positive luminosity scaling of the time lag ( @xmath181 ; eq .",
    "[ eq : lag ] ) . recalling that @xmath182 , eq .  [ eq : tviscx ] gives @xmath183 . for a constant value of @xmath1 ,",
    "one expects to find @xmath184 , whereas we find a positive value of @xmath66 . as a bottom line , we find that the viscosity parameter varies with luminosity ( or equivalently , mass accretion rate ) as @xmath185 .",
    "an inverse scaling such as we predict has in fact , already been suggested for lmc x3 based purely on changes in its disk spectra as the luminosity varies @xcite .",
    "if this scaling is related to the increase in temperature which results from a higher @xmath22 , then @xmath1 may be lower in the inner disk , without the @xmath1-disk interpretation breaking down .",
    "a weaker scaling with temperature would be compatible . ] .",
    "however , grmhd simulations indicate that @xmath1 increases as radius decreases , at least for the innermost disk where mhd turbulence is dominant @xcite .",
    "of course , there is no reason to expect viscosity to be constant over the disk .",
    "in particular , the viscosity may depend on other factors such as the disk s density , temperature or magnetization .",
    "@xcite provide one possible explanation for the scaling relation we find relating @xmath1 and luminosity .",
    "these authors find an inverse scaling between @xmath1 and the ratio of gas - to - magnetic pressures , @xmath186 ( a net quantity usually referred to as `` plasma @xmath66 '' ) .",
    "given the scaling , @xmath187 , if @xmath188 is sufficiently insensitive to the accretion flow in the outer disk , then one would expect that as the mass transfer rate ( @xmath189 ) varies , when @xmath189 increases , @xmath190 will too .",
    "a more specific prediction would be beyond scope of this work , but we note qualitatively that this effect very naturally gives rise to an inverse relationship between @xmath1 and mass accretion rate , as required by our fit .",
    "motivated by a roughly two - week time - lagged correlation between the oir and x - ray light curves of lmc x3 , we develop a new method of analysis that is applicable to active x - ray binary systems .",
    "we model the oir emission deterministically as a combination of accretion emission , x - ray reprocessing , and stellar emission .",
    "the components driven by accretion are computed using the x - ray light curve .",
    "the model allows accretion signals to be filtered out of the oir light curves , thereby isolating the stellar component of light .",
    "the utility of this technique is demonstrated for lmc x3 , a system which exhibits large - amplitude , but simple , variability in its perennial thermal state .",
    "we demonstrate that this method improves the observability of the stellar ellipsoidal light curves and leads to an improved determination of the orbital period .",
    "furthermore , the method allows one to disentangle the oir component of disk emission from the reprocessed x - ray emission .",
    "the time lags in the system are independent of wavelength , which indicates that they originate from a hot ring at a single , fixed radius in the disk .",
    "we identify the radius of this ring as the circularization radius where the tidal stream from lmc x3 s b - star companion meets the disk , inducing a bright shock .    by interpreting our results through the lens of @xmath1-disk models",
    ", we estimate the viscosity in the outer disk : based upon the average properties of the disk , we estimate @xmath180 to order magnitude .",
    "furthermore , we unexpectedly find that @xmath1 diminishes as luminosity increases ( @xmath191 ) .",
    "we speculate that this result may be related to changes in @xmath192 related to evolution in the mass accretion rate in the outer disk ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank poshak gandhi , chris done , ramesh narayan , andy fabian , and joey neilsen for helpful discussions which have improved this work , as well as the anonymous referee , for her / his helpful review .",
    "we thank catherine brocksopp for making her b01 data set available to us , and xuening bai for his input on disk theory .",
    "support for jfs has been provided by nasa hubble fellowship grant hst - hf-51315.01 .",
    "our model has many free parameters ( @xmath193 ) , and it is therefore nontrivial to assess parameter degeneracies in the model . in figure  [ fig : pairs ] we present pairwise correlations from a randomly - selected subsample of the mcmc chains for the principal fit parameters of the model .",
    "parameters which are independently determined for the various oir bands are shown together in color .",
    "few trends are strongly evident .",
    "the strongest is an anticorrelation between @xmath80 , the index which relates the degree of x - ray heating to luminosity , and the normalization to that scaling , @xmath79 ( eq .  [ eq : xheat ] ) .",
    "also evident is a much weaker and positive correlation between @xmath81 and @xmath79 .",
    "next - most prominent is an anticorrelation between @xmath66 and the disk emission strength @xmath194 , where the effect is strongest for shorter wavelengths .",
    "while the wavelength dependence of a given pair of model parameters does not necessarily indicate a degeneracy in the model , it can nevertheless be revealing .",
    "in particular , strongly positive trends with wavelength are evident and expected amongst parameters that characterize the disk brightness and stellar brightness ( i.e. , panels with pairs of @xmath194 , @xmath60 , and @xmath62 ) .",
    "conversely , the _ wavelength independence _ of the accretion lag , @xmath70 , an important result from this work , is evident in figure  [ fig : pairs ] .",
    "one drawback to our approach is that although we model dynamic evolution of the accretion - disk system , we have adopted a structure rooted in a steady - state formalism .",
    "we now consider an improved treatment of non - stationary behavior with our model .",
    "descriptively , we better allow for compression and expansion of the individual annuli by introducing a term that allows for stretching action by adjacent rings . specifically , we modify equation  [ eq : f_lag ] by allowing x - ray heating to depend on the time derivative of the inner - disk accretion rate , @xmath195 . with this modification , equation",
    "[ eq : f_lag ] becomes @xmath196^\\beta , \\label{eq : mddot}\\ ] ] where @xmath197 and @xmath198 are additional free parameters used to determine radial expansion or compression of the flow .",
    "this alternate formulation has only a minor affect on the fits to the oir light curves ; the fitting results are given in table  [ tab : model2 ] .",
    "the quality of the fit is only moderately improved , @xmath199 for two additional free parameters .",
    "the principal change is that the ( average ) time lag inferred is smaller by @xmath200 compared to the principal model , which is perhaps a consequence of a phase shift induced when mixing the @xmath22-light curve with its time derivative .",
    "detailed consideration of non - stationary disk modeling within the paradigm of a bifurcated , two - state accretion flow , as applied to lmc x3 , can be found in @xcite .",
