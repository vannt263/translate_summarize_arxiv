    "linear stability theory can predict sufficient conditions for instability , but some sort of nonlinear analysis is necessary to determine stability against finite amplitude perturbations . in many fluid dynamic systems",
    "the notion of nonlinear energy stability is useful for determining conditions for absolute stability @xcite .",
    "energy stability theory exploits the observation that physically natural energy functionals may generate norms that can be used to measure the amplitude of disturbances about a base flow .",
    "energy analysis typically leads to sufficient conditions for the norms of arbitrary amplitude disturbances to decay monotonically in time , a very strong notion of absolute stability .",
    "for example , steady states of incompressible newtonian fluids are very generally energy stable at sufficiently low reynolds numbers . in some cases , notably simple rayleigh - benard convection problems in the boussinesq approximation ,",
    "the critical rayleigh numbers for energy stability and linear instability coincide to establish the supercritical nature of the bifurcation point @xcite .",
    "moreover , energy methods can be generalized to derive rigorous bounds on flow quantities for high reynolds ( or rayleigh ) number steady , unsteady and even turbulent flows @xcite .",
    "elastic and kinetic energy budgets have been used frequently in the past for the linear stability analysis of dilute polymer solutions in simple flow geometries .",
    "purely elastic instabilities at small reynolds numbers were analyzed by joo and shaqfeh @xcite ( a review can be found in @xcite ) for an oldroyd - b fluid in a taylor - couette geometry . in the total disturbance energy balance ,",
    "coupling between perturbations of the velocity field and gradients of the polymer stress showed the same temporal growth as the kinetic energy of flow and were thus identified as the ones causing the instability .",
    "similar energy budget considerations were applied and extended by sureshkumar for linear stability analysis of plane poiseuille flows at larger reynolds number @xcite where the importance of this coupling was confirmed .",
    "for growing weissenberg numbers the coupling of velocity perturbations to gradients of normal viscoelastic stresses was found to dominate the destabilization .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the notion of nonlinear energy stability for oldroyd - b fluids . to set the stage and fix notation , first recall the case of plane couette flow of a newtonian fluid .",
    "the fluid is confined between parallel horizontal plates at @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with the lower plate at rest and the upper plate moving in the @xmath2-direction ( @xmath3 ) with velocity @xmath4 . for simplicity",
    ", we consider periodic conditions in the streamwise ( @xmath3 ) and cross - stream ( @xmath5 ) directions .",
    "measuring length in units of @xmath6 and time in units of @xmath7 , the velocity vector field @xmath8 of an incompressible newtonian fluid satisfies the navier - stokes equations @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the reynolds number defined in terms of the kinematic viscosity of the fluid @xmath11 .",
    "the kinetic energy evolution equation is @xmath12 the negative definite term on the right hand side is the bulk viscous energy dissipation rate , and the indefinite term is the power expended by the agent enforcing the boundary condition .",
    "plane couette flow , an exact steady solution in this geometry at every reynolds number , is @xmath13 if we perturb plane couette flow at time @xmath14 with an initial condition @xmath15 then the energy in the subsequent disturbance @xmath16 evolves according to @xmath17 energy stability theory ensures us that there is a positive critical value @xmath18 @xcite such that @xmath19 guarantees that there exists a number @xmath20 such that @xmath21 this in turn implies @xmath22 so the norm of the perturbation decays monotonically ( and exponentially ) as @xmath23 .",
    "this is the sense in which plane couette flow is absolutely stable to arbitrary ( finite energy ) disturbances when @xmath19 .",
    "plane couette flow is linearly stable at all @xmath24 @xcite , but finite amplitude disturbances may not decay sufficiently high above the energy stability limit .",
    "non - normal amplification of small disturbances , a transient growth phenomenon available even in linearly stable systems , is recognized as an effective mechanism for stimulating finite - amplitude instabilities @xcite .    in the following sections we address the question of whether or not this notion of energy stability may be fruitfully generalized to oldroyd - b fluids .",
    "there have been previous analyses in this direction for other non - newtonian constitutive relations @xcite , and _ a priori _ energy estimates for oldroyd - b fluids @xcite , but to our knowledge there has been no definitive determination of whether an energy stability principle exists for oldroyd - b fluids .",
    "here we show by example that no such principle is possible in general for oldroyd - b fluids . by examining particular exact solutions to the full nonlinear equations of motion we determine that some perturbations will grow , absorbing energy from the base flow , even at arbitrarily small ( but nonvanishing ) reynolds numbers .",
    "in nondimensional form , the equations of motion for an oldroyd - b fluid in the plane couette geometry and @xmath25 with the lower plate at rest and the upper plate moving in the @xmath2-direction ( @xmath3 ) with velocity @xmath26 and , for simplicity , periodic conditions in the streamwise ( @xmath3 ) and cross - stream ( @xmath5 ) directions . ] are @xmath27 where @xmath10 is the reynolds number . the polymer stress tensor @xmath28 is @xmath29 where the weissenberg number @xmath30 is the product of the polymer relaxation time @xmath31 and the imposed rate of strain @xmath32 , the parameter @xmath33 is the coupling constant proportional to the concentration of the polymers in the flow , and the polymer configuration tensor @xmath34 evolves according to @xmath35 the component @xmath36 of the configuration tensor @xmath37 is the end - to - end moment @xmath38 of the extension of the polymers , modeled as linear springs . in this scaling , the equilibrium configuration corresponds to an isotropic distribution with unit end - to - end displacements .",
    "the elastic energy ( density ) stored in the polymers is proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "the kinetic energy evolution equation is @xmath40 the first ( negative definite ) term on the right hand side is the bulk viscous energy dissipation rate ; the second ( indefinite ) term is the power expended by the agent enforcing the boundary condition ; the third ( indefinite ) term corresponds to the rate of work done by the polymers on the flow , an energy exchange term .",
    "the elastic energy stored in the polymers evolves according to @xmath41 the two terms on the right hand side are , respectively , the rate of work done by the flow on the polymers and the dissipation rate due to polymer relaxation processes . hence the total energy is identified as the sum of the fluid s kinetic energy and the polymers elastic potential energy , @xmath42 dx dy dz } , \\label{eob}\\ ] ] and the total energy evolution is @xmath43 expressing the net balance between dissipation ( the first two negative terms on the right hand side ) and the work done on the fluid by the agency imposing the boundary condition ( the indefinite surface integral of the stresses ) .",
    "two distinct obstructions stand in the way of attempts to generalize the property of energy stability to oldroyd - b fluids .",
    "the first problem is evident already in ( [ eob ] ) : while the kinetic energy defines a natural norm on the velocity field , the polymer energy does not correspond to a norm ( or even a metric ) on the polymer stress field @xcite .",
    "indeed , the physically relevant space for the polymer configuration tensor @xmath37 is the set of positive symmetric matrices , but this does not constitute a linear vector space .",
    "so strictly speaking the concept of a norm is not meaningful .",
    "more importantly , though , while it is true that for positive symmetric matrices @xmath44 implies @xmath45 , the trace does not satisfy a triangle inequality necessary for a metric .",
    "it is clear , then , that the most straightforward generalization of energy stability will not work for oldroyd - b fluids .",
    "nevertheless , various norms or metrics can be defined on perturbations ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) of the variables .",
    "for example , an @xmath48 norm could be defined by @xmath49 dx dy dz},\\ ] ] or a functional like @xmath50 dx dy dz}\\ ] ] could be used as an effective measure of the amplitude of perturbations . in any case",
    "there is a second fundamental  in this case dynamical  obstruction to a principle of energy stability in oldroyd - b fluids : as will be shown in the next section , the problem is that it is possible for perturbations to absorb energy from a base flow and , by any reasonable measure , grow at arbitrarily low @xmath24 . that is , it is _ not _ possible to assert in any generality that there is an analog of energy stability in the sense that there is a _ positive _ critical value @xmath51 so that @xmath19 implies that all perturbations decay monotonically .",
    "this  no - go \" result is established by producing specific examples where disturbances do not decay monotonically at arbitrarily low @xmath24 .",
    "plane couette flow @xmath52 is an exact solution of the oldroyd - b equations ( [ ob1]-[ob3 ] ) in the plane shear geometry when augmented with the constant ( in space and time ) polymer stress tensor @xmath53 this flow is linearly stable for upper convected maxwell fluids @xcite , i.e. , when @xmath54 .",
    "consider perturbations with @xmath55 and @xmath56 where , preserving the symmetry , @xmath57 .",
    "that is , we look for solutions where the polymer stress tensor is a function of time , but not space , so there is no influence of the polymers back onto the flow field . for this class of solutions",
    "there are no perturbations of the velocity field or the newtonian stress .",
    "inserting this ansatz into the full nonlinear equations of motion produces an exact closed set of _ linear _ ordinary differential equations for the components of @xmath58 : @xmath59 the general solutions , uniform in @xmath24 , are @xmath60 e^{-t / wi},\\\\ \\delta c_{12}(t ) & =   [ \\delta c_{12}(0 ) + \\delta c_{22}(0)t ] e^{-t / wi},\\\\ \\delta c_{22}(t ) & = \\delta c_{22}(0)e^{-t / wi}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these solutions display non - normal transient growth for a variety of initial data as long as @xmath61 is not too small .",
    "for example consider the zero energy ( i.e , trace @xmath62 ) perturbation @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "the time - dependent perturbation of the conformation tensor is then @xmath65 while the perturbations eventually decay exponentially ( with algebraic modification ) , the transient dynamics can by highly non - monotonic .",
    "for example the polymer - induced stress @xmath66 overshoots its steady value before relaxing .",
    "the energy perturbation in the polymers for this solution is @xmath67 this disturbance initially grows nearly quadratically in time to a maximum at @xmath68 where @xmath69 constituting an @xmath70 variation in polymer energy before decay sets in .",
    "more significantly for our purposes is the evolution of a norm - like measure of the perturbation such as the amplitude @xmath71 although @xmath72 initially decreases , it displays a period of increase when @xmath73 .",
    "this behavior is plotted for several values of @xmath61 in figure 1 .",
    "we have found non - normal features in the solutions for any @xmath74 .",
    "consider , for example , initial perturbations with @xmath75 with @xmath76 to maintain the positive definiteness of * c*. the amplitude of this disturbance evolves according to @xmath77 and it is easy to confirm that this amplitude exhibits transient amplification so long as @xmath74 .",
    "a particular example that gives some insight into a physical mechanism for the transient growth behavior is the zero energy initial perturbation @xmath78 where @xmath79 corresponds to a ( small ) uniform rotation of the polymers from their stationary configurations .",
    "as illustrated in figure 2 , the initially rotated ellipsoid representing the mean polymer extension is stretched by the background shear well beyond the initial value  by an @xmath80 factor at large @xmath61before reassuming the stationary configuration . during the period of transient growth ,",
    "the polymers absorb energy from the background shear flow faster than the elastic relaxation can dissipate it .",
    "the conventional notion of energy stability of a stationary flow implies monotonic decay of some meaningful measure of the magnitude of arbitrary amplitude disturbances .",
    "the exact solutions developed in the preceeding section show that it is generally _ not _ possible to establish monotonic decay of arbitrary perturbations of steady flows of oldroyd - b fluids at finite reynolds numbers .",
    "these examples require a nonvanishing ( and not arbitrarily small ) weissenberg number so there must be some nonvanishing shear in the base flow , but the observed transient amplification of perturbations , up to @xmath80 in magnitude , are uniform in the fluid s kinematic viscosity and @xmath24 . while a base flow may be linearly stable , the ` extra ' degrees of freedom in the polymers may allow for exact solutions displaying non - normal transient growth .",
    "we remark that the problems extending energy stability techniques pointed out here are not mitigated by using another physically motivated energy functional where a thermodynamic free energy takes the place of the mechanical elastic energy alone @xcite .",
    "that is , a free energy density of the form @xmath81 includes entropic effects so that the free energy minimum is precisely the equilibrium polymer configuration with @xmath82 .",
    "however this still does not induce a proper metric or norm on configurations and because it does not affect the equations of motion , the non - normal growth phenomena and the obstructions it presents are still present .",
    "finally , after this work was completed we became aware of the analysis of morozov and van saarloos @xcite on an elastic finite - amplitude instability for sufficiently high weissenberg number and arbitrarily low reynolds number .",
    "that work goes beyond the observations presented here by explicitly displaying an additional stationary solution to the fully nonlinear 3-d equations .",
