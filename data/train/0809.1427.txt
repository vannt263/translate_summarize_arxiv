    "the availability of high - precision helioseismic data and the advancement of local helioseismology techniques have enabled investigations of fine details of solar internal dynamics for small regions of the sun .",
    "some of the methods , such as ring - diagram and time - distance analyses , have also enabled us examine details of the structure below solar active regions .",
    "ring - diagram analysis ( hill , 1988 ; patron _ et al . _ ,",
    "1997 ) is used to determine frequencies of short - wavelength ( high degree ) modes in a small region of the sun .",
    "these are modes that can be approximated as plane waves over a small area of the sun .",
    "these frequencies can be inverted to determine the structure of the region under study using the same techniques that are used to invert global modes to study the spherically symmetric part of the solar structure . to avoid systematic errors , structure inversions",
    "are usually done using frequency differences between two regions to determine the difference in structure between the two regions ( _ e.g. _ , basu , antia and bogart , 2004 , 2007 ) .",
    "time - distance helioseismology ( duvall _ et al . _ , 1993 )",
    "measures the variations in the travel time of acoustic waves .",
    "the travel - time variations can then be used to infer the variations in the wave speed and flow velocity through an inversion procedure ( _ e.g. _ , kosovichev , duvall , and scherrer , 2000 ; kosovichev , duvall , and birch , 2001 ) .",
    "basu , antia , and bogart ( 2004 ) inverted the frequency differences between several active regions and nearby quiet regions to determine the sound - speed difference and the difference in the adiabatic index @xmath2 between these pairs of regions .",
    "they found that for all the active region ",
    "quiet region pairs , the sound speed below the active regions was smaller than that of the quiet regions for about the first 7 mm , and then the sound speed became larger in the active regions than in the quiet regions .",
    "a similar behavior was seen for the adiabatic index ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "qualitatively similar results were obtained by kosovichev , duvall , and scherrer ( 2000 ) and kosovichev , duvall , and birch ( 2001 ) using time - distance analysis .",
    "kosovichev , duvall , and scherrer ( 2000 ) , kosovichev , duvall , and birch ( 2001 ) , and basu , antia , and bogart ( 2004 ) interpreted the results in terms of a temperature difference , and alternatively as a difference in the magnetic field .",
    "however , by examining the @xmath2 differences , basu , antia , and bogart ( 2004 ) also concluded that the results can not be explained as being caused by temperature changes or magnetic fields alone .",
    "the presence of magnetic fields can affect the frequencies of waves in two ways : firstly , the magnetic fields change the thermodynamic structure ( _ i.e. _ , pressure and temperature profiles ) of the medium that the waves travel through , which , in turn , changes the frequencies of the waves . secondly , the plasma waves are directly affected by the magnetic fields through the lorentz force . in other words , the modification to the frequencies results from both structural and non - structural ( _ i.e. _ , lorentz force ) effects of the magnetic fields .",
    "since the two effects are inseparable in the observed frequencies , the `` structures '' revealed by the inversions could partly be the manifestations of the frequency difference caused by lorentz force on wave propagation .",
    "in addition , the inversion kernels to - date have been derived from non - magnetic reference models . since the structural variables of a magnetic model have both magnetic and non - magnetic ( gas ) components , it had been uncertain if an inversion using a non - magnetic reference model would reveal the whole or only the gas part of the structural change . by using solar models that include magnetic fields and inversion kernels computed from non - magnetic reference models ,",
    "lin , li , and basu ( 2006 ) showed that the `` sound speed '' revealed by the inversions in the presence of magnetic fields is in fact a combination of both sound speed ( @xmath3 ) and alfvn speed ( @xmath4 ) . to distinguish this property from the actual sound speed , we call it `` wave speed '' , defined as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the total pressure ( @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the magnetic - field strength ) .",
    "while the speed of sound is directly related to temperature , there is no simple , direct relationship between the  wave speed  @xmath10 and either temperature or magnetic fields .",
    "hence , it has not been possible to determine the magnetic - field and temperature profiles below active regions with any degree of accuracy .    in this paper",
    ", we use solar models that include magnetic fields to first confirm the lin , li , and basu ( 2006 ) results and then derive a practical way of using the wave speed and @xmath2 inversion results to determine the thermal and magnetic structural differences between active and quiet regions . after confirming the reliability of this method to infer the thermal and magnetic structures , we then",
    "apply it to the inversion results of basu , antia , and bogart ( 2004 ) .",
    "the main limitation of our models is that they are one dimensional , and hence the form of magnetic fields allowed is quite restrictive .",
    "we can not , for example , have toroidal magnetic fields or magnetic fields over restricted ranges of latitudes or longitudes .",
    "however , we are forced to use such models because the codes to construct self - consistent solar models with arbitrary magnetic fields do not yet exist .",
    "a consequence of using 1d models is that we are likely to overestimate the effect of magnetic fields on thermal transport . in the real , three - dimensional case , convection , when obstructed by a magnetic flux tube",
    "can bend around the tube , which is not possible in the 1d case .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : we describe the magnetic models in section  [ sec : mdl ] .",
    "a brief description of the inversion technique and the inversion results obtained from pairs of models are given in section  [ sec : inv ] .",
    "the strategy to link the inversion results and temperature and magnetic fields is derived in section  [ sec : calib ] .",
    "we apply the strategy to solar data in section  [ sec : sun ] , and discuss the results in section  [ sec : interpretation ] .",
    "the result of an attempt to model the subsurface magnetic structure is presented in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "we summarize our results in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "it should be noted that although we apply our method to results from ring - diagram analyses , it can be applied to any helioseismic technique that can determine the adiabatic index ( @xmath2 ) below active regions .",
    "since ring - diagram analysis is a variant of global - mode analysis , we model the difference between quiet and active regions as the difference between a solar model with no magnetic fields and a solar model that contains magnetic fields and the associated effects .",
    "we use a modified version of yrec ( the yale rotation and evolution code : demarque _ et al . _ , 2008 ) to construct the models .",
    "how magnetic effects are incorporated in the models has been described in detail by li and sofia ( 2001 ) and li _ et al .",
    "_ , ( 2003 ) .",
    "we give a brief overview here .",
    "to compute the effects of the magnetic fields , two magnetic variables are introduced .",
    "they are the magnetic energy density ( @xmath11 ) which describes the magnetic perturbation strength , and the magnetic field direction [ @xmath12 which accounts for the tensorial feature of the magnetic pressure . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are respectively the toroidal and poloidal components of the magnetic field",
    ". the magnetic pressure can then be expressed in terms of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , that is , @xmath18 , in which the fact that the pressure is a tensor in the presence of magnetic fields has been taken into account .    with the addition of the magnetic variables , the equations of magnetic models are as following ( lydon and sofia , 1995 ; li and sofia , 2001 ; li _ et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ) :    @xmath19    and the first law of thermodynamics becomes : @xmath20 this modification thus affects the luminosity equation and the energy - transport equations ( equation  [ eq : energy ] and equation  [ eq : trans_conv ] ) . in the above equations",
    ", @xmath21 is the mass inside a radius @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the energy generation rate , @xmath24 is the radiation energy density ( @xmath25 being radiation constant ) , and @xmath26 is the dimensionless temperature gradient when magnetic fields are included .",
    "these equations are similar to those governing non - magnetic models except that the pressure , total internal energy , and entropy now have a magnetic term , that is : @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the solar models are constructed with opal opacities ( iglesias and rogers , 1996 ) at high temperatures and alexander and ferguson ( 1994 ) opacities at low temperatures .",
    "nuclear reaction rates of bahcall and pinsonneault ( 1992 ) were used .",
    "it should be noted that since we are dealing with the outermost layers of the model , the nuclear reaction rates only play an indirect role .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) of the gaseous phase is from opal ( rogers and nayfonov , 2002 ) .",
    "however , this has to be modified in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "the equation of state is formally @xmath30 , in addition to the usual dependence on chemical abundances : @xmath31 plus terms due to composition . in the equation , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35",
    "are partial derivatives with respect to @xmath6 , @xmath36 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .    thus equation  [ eq : second ] can be re - written as : @xmath37    the adiabatic index @xmath2 can be written in the same usual form , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the modified adiabatic gradient and is given by @xmath40 where , as usual , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the derivatives @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath44 change in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "the way that the eos has been implemented is as follows : we determine `` uncorrected '' density [ @xmath45 at a given chemical composition using the opal equation of state tables .",
    "the density is then corrected for the missing effects to obtain the actual density [ @xmath46 .",
    "we then calculate the changes in @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath44 caused by the presence of magnetic fields , and then use those to calculate @xmath2 .",
    "the changes in @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath44 also change energy transport .",
    "we use the mixing - length approximation , but with @xmath47 replaced by @xmath39 and with the modified values of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath44 , _",
    "etc_. this modifies the properties of convection .",
    "there are also changes in the properties of convection .",
    "the details of including the magnetic effects in models can be found in lydon and sofia ( 1995 ) , li and sofia ( 2001 ) and li _ et al . _",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "the magnetic profile of our models is specified by the distribution of @xmath15 .",
    "we have chosen a gaussian profile for @xmath15 because a gaussian profile has an unambiguous peak , its sphere of influence is well defined , and it has no discontinuities that can create havoc with both stellar structure and subsequent frequency calculations .",
    "furthermore , other complex fields can be constructed by simply using several gaussian profiles .",
    "the gaussian profile of @xmath15 is of the following form : @xmath48.\\ ] ] @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 are the adjustable parameters for the depth ( in terms of @xmath52 ) of the peak of the magnetic field and the width ( dimensionless ) of the profile , respectively .",
    "@xmath53 , in which @xmath54 is the tuning parameter for the peak magnetic field strength and @xmath55 is the density at @xmath50 .    in short ,",
    "different magnetic models are only distinguished by their magnetic profiles , which are specified by three parameters : @xmath54 ( peak strength ) , @xmath50 ( peak location ) and @xmath51 ( width ) .",
    "although this simple profile is implemented in most of our models to study the relation between the `` wave speed '' and the magnetic and thermal structures , we have also constructed other types of field profiles by using multiple gaussians in order to check the validity of the relation in a complex field .    .",
    "the gray dashed line shows the ratio of the magnetic to gas pressure , and the value can be read from the right - hand ordinate . ]",
    "the relative differences of several structural parameters between a magnetic and a non - magnetic model are shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "we define @xmath56 . as @xmath57 in the non - magnetic reference model",
    ", @xmath58 illustrates the magnetic configuration in the magnetic model in this case .",
    "it is plotted as a gray dashed line using the scale at the right side .",
    "we can see that @xmath59 and @xmath60 are very different ( @xmath61 in the non - magnetic reference model ) .",
    "the wave - speed difference ( @xmath60 ) changes from negative to positive in the region of the magnetic fields while @xmath59 shows a single dip in the region .",
    "the positive and negative peaks of @xmath60 do not show any explicit correlation with the profile of the magnetic fields .",
    "unsurprisingly , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 become almost identical at greater distances from the region of magnetic effects , which confirms that @xmath60 is indeed a good representation of temperature difference in non - magnetic regions .",
    "another important feature is that , except for @xmath65 , all variables show the influence of the magnetic field at large distances from the field .",
    "the @xmath65 profile approximately follows the profile of @xmath66 with no tail below the region of the magnetic fields . in other words ,",
    "the magnetic effect on @xmath2 is fairly localized to the vicinity of the magnetic fields .",
    "although the situation may change in two - dimensional models , where more realistic magnetic configurations are used , the basic features in the differences of the structure parameters are expected to remain the same .",
    "the frequencies of solar oscillation modes depend on the solar structure .",
    "the starting point of helioseismic inversions is the linearization of the oscillation equations around a known solar model ( the so - called reference model ) using the variational principle .",
    "the frequency differences can then be related to the relative variations in sound speed ( @xmath67 ) and density ( @xmath17 ) either between two models or between the sun and the reference model .",
    "the relation between the differences in frequency and these two variables ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath67 and @xmath17 ) can be written as ( dziembowski , pamyatnykh and sienkiewicz , 1990 ; antia and basu , 1994 ) : @xmath68 where @xmath67 is the adiabatic sound speed , @xmath69 are the kernels and are known functions of the reference model , @xmath70 is the relative frequency difference of the @xmath71th mode , @xmath72 is the observational error in @xmath70 , and @xmath73 , usually called the `` surface term '' , represents the effect of uncertainties in the model close to the surface . here , @xmath74 is a measure of the mode inertia .",
    "other pairs of variables such as ( @xmath2 , @xmath17 ) can be used instead of the ( @xmath75 , @xmath17 ) pair used above .",
    "there are several techniques that can be used to invert equation  [ eqn : inv ] .",
    "the inversion results used in this paper were obtained using the subtractive optimally localized averages ( sola ) technique ( pijpers and thompson , 1992 , 1994 ) .",
    "the details of the inversion procedure and the quality of the averaging kernels were shown in basu , antia , and bogart ( 2004 ) .",
    "basu , antia , and bogart ( 2004 ) inverted the frequency differences between active and quiet regions , instead of between active regions and a solar model .",
    "one of the reasons for doing so was to reduce foreshortening effects .",
    "the projection of the spherical solar surface onto a flat map introduces some foreshortening that depends on the distance of the region from the disc center , which can cause systematic errors in determining the mode characteristics . by selecting comparison regions at the similar latitudes and tracking both in time intervals symmetric about their central meridian passages ( cmp )",
    ", the authors assured that the foreshortening effects in both regions are nearly identical , and , hence , the effect is eliminated to a large degree by taking the difference .",
    "such a difference also reduces the so - called `` surface term '' in the inversion . a large part of the surface term in frequency differences between solar models and the sun arises from shortcomings in modeling the near - surface layers of the sun . since the featured inversions are for two sets of solar frequency differences , the surface term is much smaller , and only one surface term suffices .",
    "the accuracy of their inversion results were ensured by the consistency between the the results from sola and the results from regularized least squares ( rls ) .",
    "it should be noted that the inversion kernels were calculated without any effect of the magnetic fields included , and as a result the  sound speed ",
    "inversions yield results that are a combination of the real sound speed difference and a magnetic component .",
    "to simulate the aforementioned ring - diagram inversions , we use a non - magnetic model as the reference model .",
    "however , since quiet regions may also have magnetic fields in the deeper regions , we have also examined inversions between two magnetic models while still using non - magnetic kernels .",
    "we constructed a number of different magnetic models as the test models in order to determine @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 between the magnetic models and the non - magnetic reference model . in order to estimate the errors in the inversion results that are caused by the errors in the observed frequencies , we select only those modes that are also present in the observational data .",
    "the observational data set we use for the mode selection is from rhodes _",
    "( 1998 ) , which is based on 61 days of data collected by the _ soi / mdi _ instruments beginning in may 1996 . the data set",
    "f _ modes and _ p _ modes up to @xmath79 .",
    "this set is much larger than data sets obtained from ring - diagram analyses . however , since our objective is merely to determine what variables are actually obtained by the usual `` sound - speed '' and @xmath2 inversions , a larger data set will not affect our conclusion . we have also used the 360-day mode - set from mdi ( schou , 1999 ) .",
    "the magnetic effects on thermal structures are different at different depths .",
    "this is not only because the ratio of magnetic to gas pressure depends on the location , but also because any related changes in temperature can shift the position of the ionization zone .",
    "hence , we need to examine the inversion results at different depths in order to investigate how the variations of magnetic profiles affect different structural properties ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath80 , @xmath10 , @xmath2 , and @xmath17 ) and the difference between @xmath80 and @xmath10 , as well as to determine whether or not the inversion can consistently and accurately reveal these properties under different magnetic situations .    in figure  [ fig:2 ]",
    "we show the results of `` sound - speed '' inversions for two cases . in panel",
    "( a ) we show the inversion results when one of the models is non - magnetic , and in panel ( b ) we show the results of inverting the frequency differences between two magnetic models . in each case , the inversion kernels were from a non - magnetic model .",
    "the figure shows that what the inversion produces is not the usual `` sound speed '' difference , _",
    "i.e. _ , difference of the quantity @xmath81 , but a `` wave speed '' difference where the `` wave speed '' is defined as @xmath82 , thereby confirming the results of lin , li , and basu ( 2006 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] shows the inversion results of @xmath77 [ panel ( a ) ] and @xmath78 [ panel ( b ) ] . in both cases",
    "we used the same models as in figure  [ fig:2](b ) .",
    "because the adiabatic index ( @xmath2 ) is a function of the equation of state and because density ( @xmath17 ) is an intrinsic property of gas , it is not sensible to split them into magnetic and non - magnetic components . @xmath77 and @xmath78 reflect the changes in the equations of state and in the gas distribution caused by the presence of magnetic fields . from figure  [ fig:3 ]",
    ", we can see that the inversion results closely follow the computed values even though the inversion kernels were derived from a non - magnetic model .",
    "however , the errors in the @xmath83 inversions are too large for the results to be useful . with the limited mode sets obtained from ring - diagram analysis",
    ", the errors would be even larger , and hence only in very rare cases can a proper density inversion be done .     with the exact relative differences of the sound speed and of the wave speed .",
    "the dotted line is the sound - speed difference [ @xmath84 and the solid line is wave speed difference [ @xmath85 , where @xmath86 refers to @xmath75 of the reference model .",
    "note that @xmath87 , @xmath10 , and @xmath80 are the same in the non - magnetic reference model .",
    "the parameters of the magnetic - field profile are indicated in each panel .",
    "the inverted values are plotted as symbols along with the error bars .",
    "the errors are obtained from the observational errors in the frequencies .",
    "the inversion in ( a ) are with the rhodes _",
    "et al . _ mode - set , the one in ( b ) is with the schou ( 1999 ) set . ]",
    "( upper panel ) and @xmath83 ( lower panel ) . in both panels",
    ", the solid line is the exact difference between the magnetic model and the reference model ( _ cf .",
    "_ figure  [ fig:2](b ) for details of the models ) .",
    "the inverted results are plotted as symbols along with the error bars .",
    "the errors are obtained from the observational errors of the modes used in the inversion .",
    "the inversions are with the schou ( 1999 ) mode set . ]",
    "although the frequencies of both magnetic and non - magnetic models were computed from our pulsation code , which does not include the lorentz - force effect , the effect of the absence is clearly not significant .",
    "if it were , the inversion results would have shown large deviations for models with different types of magnetic profiles since the direct effects on wave frequencies would be very different for different modes that have different lower turning points with respect to the field positions . clearly , such deviations are not seen .",
    "the inversion results also show that the use of non - magnetic kernels do not lead to any significant errors in the inversion results and hence we are justified in using the results of basu , antia , and bogart ( 2004 ) .",
    "thus , the examples in figures  [ fig:2 ] and [ fig:3 ] show that the structural differences revealed by the inversions implemented with non - magnetic kernels are a combination of both direct magnetic effects and the gaseous structural changes .",
    "the wave speed ( @xmath10 ) is affected by both the magnetic fields and the thermal structures . in the following ,",
    "we derive the relations between the relative wave - speed difference ( @xmath88 ) and the differences in the magnetic structures ( represented by @xmath89 ) and in the thermal structures ( reflected in @xmath90 or @xmath91 ) .",
    "the subscripts 1 and 0 in the equations denote the test and reference models wherever there may be confusion .",
    "we should point out that the reference model in the following derivation can be either magnetic or non - magnetic .",
    "when @xmath92 , we obtain the special case of a non - magnetic reference model .",
    "@xmath93^{-1 } , \\label{eqn : ct}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath94 is the magnetic to gas pressure ratio in a reference model .",
    "the quantity @xmath95 can be related to @xmath96 as follows : @xmath97 by using equation  ( [ eqn : beta_pmag ] ) and assuming @xmath98 and @xmath99 , equation  ( [ eqn : ct ] ) becomes : @xmath100 which can also be expressed in the following form : @xmath101 by using the relation @xmath102 .",
    "although @xmath102 is the same form as the equation of state for an ideal gas , we are assuming that all non - ideal effects are incorporated in the term @xmath103 . while @xmath103 is therefore not strictly the mean molecular weight in the above equations , this allows us to express the sound speed as above and allows equations  ( [ eqn : ct_cg ] ) and ( [ eqn : ct_beta ] ) to be valid in non - ideal gas situations .",
    "it is in fact a standard procedure to modify @xmath103 in the region of our study because the main non - ideal effect in this region is ionization .    as can be seen from equations  ( [ eqn : ct_cg ] ) and",
    "( [ eqn : ct_beta ] ) , @xmath88 results from not only the magnetic effects but also the difference in the sound speed , which represents the difference in the gas structure .",
    "when the magnitude of @xmath89 is comparable to the magnitudes of other differences in equation  ( [ eqn : ct_beta ] ) , @xmath104 should not be interpreted as the temperature difference . nevertheless , if @xmath89 can be determined and if @xmath105 , we can obtain the relative difference in both sound speed and stratification : @xmath106      investigations of the structure of active regions are usually based on the assumption that the `` sound - speed '' inversion results are a good measure of the actual sound - speed difference between active and quiet regions . under such assumption , @xmath76 is considered as due entirely to the magnetic fields while @xmath107 is interpreted as difference in temperatures .",
    "although such interpretations may give qualitatively correct results , they are not quantitatively correct , as demonstrated by equations  ( [ eqn : ct_cg ] ) and ( [ eqn : ct_beta ] ) .",
    "while it is true that in general a lower wave speed implies a lower temperature , the quantitative relationship is less direct . since @xmath77 follows the distribution of the magnetic field ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] ) , we explore the possibility of obtaining a relation between @xmath108 and @xmath77 . in the region",
    "where ring - diagram inversion is valid ( approximately @xmath109 to @xmath110 ) , the effort is complicated by the fact that the region is an ionization zone and that @xmath2 changes as a result of ionization .",
    "the presence of magnetic fields will change the temperature profile , which in turn leads to shifting of ionization zones and thereby a change in @xmath103 at each depth .",
    "consequently , any relation we find between @xmath108 and @xmath77 is likely to depend on depth .    for the purpose of determining the relation between @xmath108 and @xmath77 ,",

    "the error bars are computed by propagating the errors from fitting and from the inversion results of @xmath77 through the @xmath89 - @xmath77 relationship derived in section  [ subsec : calib_scheme ] .",
    "the figures show that in the region above approximately @xmath118 , @xmath89 generally increases with increasing mai .",
    "the only notable exceptions are ar@xmath129 and ar@xmath130 . the anomalously low near - surface @xmath89 of the strong active regions ar@xmath129 and ar@xmath130 is worth commenting upon .",
    "these two regions have the largest number of the flares among all the regions studied , 422 for ar@xmath129 and 568 for ar@xmath130 .",
    "the next highest flare index is only 129 for ar@xmath131 .",
    "it is therefore quite likely that the flaring activity and the small @xmath108 are related .",
    "however , we need to study a much larger sample before we can draw any definite conclusions about the relation between flaring activity and @xmath89 in the shallow subsurface layer .",
    "another noticeable feature is that in the region below approximately @xmath118 , @xmath108 becomes negative .",
    "the magnitude of this negative @xmath108 in the deeper region is often comparable to that of the positive @xmath108 above @xmath118 .",
    "hence , the results indicate that the strongest magnetic effects , which we define as the largest change in @xmath66 , in ars are generally located in a shallow region above approximately @xmath132 and that the effect of magnetic fields ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath66 ) in ars become smaller than @xmath66 in qss in the deeper layers .",
    "in addition , the roughly comparable magnitudes of near - surface and deeper - layer @xmath117 seem to imply that the stronger the ar is at the surface the smaller its @xmath66 is in the deeper layers .",
    "however , it could also be that the qss chosen to pair with the weaker ars have larger @xmath66 than the qss chosen for the stronger ars .",
    "because @xmath66 is defined as the ratio between magnetic pressure and gas pressure ( @xmath133 ) , it is an indicator of the competition between the magnetic and gas effects .",
    "hence , the magnitude of @xmath66 simply indicates whether the gas or magnetic effects dominate in a region but not the actual magnitude of the magnetic fields . in other words ,",
    "a smaller @xmath66 could result from either a genuine weaker magnetic pressure or a greater gas pressure .",
    "to verify the possibilities proposed in the previous section , we examined @xmath89 between regions that have different mais and/or are observed at different times and/or locations .",
    "the main goal is to probe the distribution profiles of @xmath66 beneath an ar and a qs .",
    "specifically , we aim to reveal whether there is indeed non - negligible @xmath66 in the qss and how @xmath66 of both ars and qss change over the depth .",
    "we also wish to investigate how the profile of @xmath66 varies with time , location , and photospheric magnetic - field strength of the region observed .",
    "in addition , while we need to study more cases to confirm whether ars with prolific flares are often linked to small surface @xmath66 , we wish to propose and discuss possible connections between the flaring activities and the subsurface @xmath66 .",
    "the regions paired for this investigation are : ar@xmath130 ( 2001 march , mai @xmath134 241.6 g ) versus ar@xmath129 ( 2000 june , mai @xmath134 146.6 g ) , ar@xmath131 ( 2002 april , mai @xmath134 125.8 g ) versus ar@xmath135 ( 1999 april , mai @xmath134 53.2 g ) , ar@xmath136 ( 2002 april , mai @xmath134 86.9 g ) versus ar@xmath137 ( 1997 may , mai @xmath134 19.9 g ) , and ar@xmath136 versus ar@xmath138 ( 2002 april , mai = 23.3 g ) . for each pair , we computed the differences between the active regions ( _ i.e. _ , ar1ar0 ) and between their companion quiet regions ( _ i.e. _ , qs1qs0 ) .",
    "we also computed the difference of ar1qs0 so that the consistency of the results can be checked .",
    "@xmath89 of ar1ar0 is to investigate whether or not the distribution of @xmath66 differs between different ars .",
    "the examination of @xmath89 between two qss is firstly to verify the non - negligible magnitude of @xmath66 suggested by the results in figures  [ fig : solar1 ] and [ fig : solar2 ] and secondly to determine whether the magnetic fields in qss are uniform or different for the different quiet regions .",
    "the results are shown in figures  [ fig : solar_difar1 ] and [ fig : solar_difar2 ] .",
    "the top and bottom rows illustrate the differences between different ars and between different qss , respectively .",
    "the results of ar1qs0 for the consistency check are plotted in the middle row .     between different regions , as denoted in the plots .",
    "the date of observation is indicated under each corresponding region .",
    "the first row displays the results between two different active regions ( ars ) , the second row is between one of the ars and the quiet - sun region ( qs ) of the other one , and the bottom row shows the qs of the two active regions . ]     between different regions , as denoted in the plots .",
    "the date of observation is indicated under each corresponding region .",
    "the first row displays the results between two different active regions ( ars ) , the second row is between one of the ars and the quiet - sun region ( qs ) of the other one , and the bottom row shows the qs of the two active regions . ]",
    "we can see from the top row of figures  [ fig : solar_difar1 ] and [ fig : solar_difar2 ] that in the region below approximately @xmath118 , the @xmath66 of ars with larger mai is indeed smaller than that of ars with smaller mai .",
    "the comparison of different qss as illustrated in the bottom row shows that @xmath66 in these qss does not have explicit correlation with mai of their companion ars .",
    "for instance , while qs@xmath131 is weaker than qs@xmath135 , qs@xmath136 is clearly stronger than qs@xmath137 .",
    "a tentative picture of the magnetic structure beneath an ar that we can conjure up from these results is that the magnetic effects of the ars are most prominent in a shallow region above @xmath118 . in the deeper layers , the effects drop off more significantly in a strong ar than in a weak one .",
    "the reason could be that the magnetic fields near the surface reduce the convective motion and thus the gas pressure and density in the region , which can lead to an increased concentration of gas density and increased gas pressure below the magnetized area .",
    "the stronger the magnetic fields are , the higher the increased concentration of gas in the deeper layers would be . such increased @xmath139 , therefore , could result in lower @xmath66 .",
    "the first common feature we can see from the bottom row of figures  [ fig : solar_difar1 ] and [ fig : solar_difar2 ] is that @xmath117 of qss is smaller than that of ars . in principle , there are two possibilities for the smaller @xmath117 .",
    "it could be either the _ variation _ or the _ magnitude _ of @xmath66 is smaller in qss than in ars .",
    "we can rule out the second one because of the following reason .",
    "the magnitudes of @xmath89 in the results of ar1ar0 provide a lower limit for @xmath66 in the active regions ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath140 ) .",
    "the large negative @xmath89 seen in all ar ",
    "qs plots in figures  [ fig : solar1 ] to [ fig : solar_difar2 ] indicate that the deep - layer @xmath66 in the quiet regions should not be smaller than that in any of the active regions . as an example , ar@xmath131  ar@xmath135 and ar@xmath135  qs@xmath135 imply that @xmath141 and , consequently , @xmath142 .",
    "therefore , we can deduce from the plots that there are indeed non - negligible @xmath66 in the quiet regions and that the profile of @xmath66 varies from region to region albeit being more uniform and stable than that in the active regions .",
    "it should be noted that the qss were selected to precede or follow the selected ars , and hence , this variation between qss is probably an indication that the evolution of magnetic fields in an ar differs from ar to ar .",
    "this is confirmed by the results seen for the pair qs@xmath136 ",
    "qs@xmath138 , which are qss associated with two different active regions during the same carrington rotation .",
    "because of the way the qss were selected , such studies could be used to study the evolution of active regions .",
    "the conclusions we can deduce from the examination of qss are that there are non - uniform and significant magnetic structures in quiet regions . although the results seem to suggest that the temporal variation is greater in the deeper layers than in the shallower layers , the number of our test group is too small to draw a definite conclusion .",
    "next , we would like to address the small inferred @xmath89 in the two ars ( ar@xmath129 and ar@xmath143 ) that have the highest mai and flare number among our studied regions .",
    "as the number of such cases in our current data set is too small for us to deduce statistically valid statements , we shall only propose in the following several possible explanations based on relevant theories and recent observational results :    * _ i ) _ @xmath139 is higher in the ars with higher flaring activities , which leads to smaller @xmath66 : *    observations have shown that the magnetic fields at the photosphere level remain roughly unchanged before and after flaring events , which means that the magnetic pressure ( @xmath144 ) should not be affected much by the flares . hence , the small @xmath66 is more likely due to an increase in gas pressure and density in the shallow layers .",
    "one possible explanation for the increased gas density is that the amount of flux coming up from the convection zone may be larger in the flaring active regions than in the non - flaring ones .",
    "based on the storage model , which is a commonly accepted solar eruption model , the emerging flux accompanied with foot - point movements of coronal field lines can cause magnetic stress to build up in the corona and eventually lead to eruption ( priest and forbes 2000 ; lin , li , and basu 2003 ) .",
    "another possible source of the increased gas density is from the material flowing down from the corona after the flares .",
    "however , although it has indeed been reported by helioseismology that some large flares can cause detectable ripples at the photospheric level ( kosovichev and zharkova 1995 , 1998 ; zharkova and kosovichev 1998 ) , the mass flow from the corona , where the plasma density is approximately @xmath145 times smaller than that at the photosphere , is usually insufficient to affect surface @xmath139 ( hence @xmath66 ) by a factor of two or three , as suggested by our results ( _ cf .",
    "_ figure  [ fig : solar2 ] ) .",
    "in addition , observations have found that although up - flows and down - flows happen consecutively at the chromospheric level right after a flare , the temperature and gas density eventually return to the quiet - sun values ( _ e.g. _ , raftery et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ) .",
    "based on the conservation of mass , we may expect similar situation also occur at the photosphere level .",
    "* _ ii ) _ the relation between @xmath89 and @xmath65 derived from our models may not be suitable for the shallow layers of such highly dynamic and eruptive ars : *    in our models , the only source to affect @xmath2 is the magnetic field .",
    "however , in an explosive active region , where many dynamic activities take place , the variations in @xmath2 can come from many sources . specifically , during a flaring event , the material in the low atmosphere is heated by the energetic particles coming down from the corona .",
    "while the total mass of the down - flow material is small relative to the photospheric density , the heating and the interaction with the energetic particles can change the state of ionization , entropy , and even the equation of state itself at the surface layer .",
    "all of these effects can change @xmath2 , and thus become part of the source for the @xmath65 in our solar data . as a result",
    ", @xmath89 inferred from the relation derived from the models without these effects may not reflect the actual value .",
    "for instance , the heating may counter - act the cooling effects from the magnetic fields and cause a smaller magnitude of @xmath65 , which leads to a smaller inferred @xmath89 at the surface .",
    "in contrast , in the deeper region where the effect of the energetic particles is less and the thermal structure is better described by the structure of our models , the inferred @xmath89 would be closer to the actual value , which could be the reason why the deeper - layer @xmath89 of ar@xmath129 and ar@xmath130 is a factor of two to four larger than the surface - layer values .",
    "the above hypotheses may be verified by studying a number of active - region pairs of which both have similar mais but one has many flares and the other has zero flares .",
    "this exercise would first confirm whether the small @xmath66 near the surface is indeed a general trend in the flaring ars .",
    "if it is positively confirmed , a large @xmath117 in the deep layers would be an indication that there is likely to be emerging flux in the flaring ars to cause the small @xmath66 .",
    "in contrary , if we find that @xmath117 is small in the deep layers , it implies that there is no significant difference in the magnetic structure between flaring and non - flaring ars , and , therefore , our second hypothesis may be the explanation .",
    "after confirming the reliability of our strategy , we ventured to investigate if we may be able to tune our simple one - dimensional magnetic models to reproduce the main features commonly seen in the inversion data .",
    "specifically , the two main features we aim to reproduce are @xmath104 being positive above @xmath146 but negative below that , and an opposite profile for @xmath77 , that is , negative close to the surface but positive in the deeper layers . to produce positive @xmath104 that resemble the inversion results",
    ", our study indicates that the magnetic fields must be both strong and concentrated . to create a large , positive @xmath65 commonly seen between @xmath115 and @xmath118",
    ", the models suggest that there has to be a negative @xmath89 in that region .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig : cmp ] .",
    "although the shifting of ionization zones can also produce a positive @xmath65 , such changes are always localized around the ionization zone , and the magnitudes of the changes are much smaller than what is observed .",
    "hence , our results imply that the quiet regions , which have been considered as the non - magnetic references in the inversions , could in fact contain non - negligible magnetic pressure in the deep layers .     and @xmath147 between two models .",
    "the models were selected such that the relative differences qualitatively mimic those seen between solar active and quiet regions . also shown is @xmath108 between the two models . ]",
    "the aim of this investigation was to find a practical way to determine the thermal and magnetic structure under active regions from sound speed and @xmath2 results obtained by inverting frequency differences between active and quiet regions .",
    "we have shown that `` sound speed '' results obtained by inverting frequency differences between active and quiet regions of the sun represent the `` wave speed '' ( @xmath148 ) and not the sound speed ( @xmath149 ) or the alfvn speed .",
    "thus the results can not be interpreted as being caused by differences in either temperature or magnetic fields alone . a combination of the two is needed to interpret the results correctly .",
    "using solar models with magnetic fields , we have determined a simple relationship between @xmath77 , which is the relative difference of adiabatic index , and @xmath89 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "@xmath77 was chosen for this work because its feature is well confined in the region of magnetic fields and because it can be obtained unambiguously from inversions .",
    "we have had to derive a separate relationship between the two quantities at each depth because the process of ionization , which changes @xmath2 , varies with depth .",
    "the @xmath89 - @xmath77 relation can then used to infer the subsurface @xmath89 .",
    "the determined @xmath89 , along with inversion results of @xmath88 and @xmath65 , can be used to determine @xmath90 and @xmath150 , provided that @xmath124 between two structures is negligible ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath151 ) .",
    "this method has been validated by using models . however , as the assumption @xmath151 may not be suitable in the sun , we only present in this paper @xmath108 revealed by applying the method to the solar results obtained by basu , antia , and bogart ( 2004 ) .    the application of @xmath89 ",
    "@xmath77 relation to the solar inversion results shows that , as expected , different active regions behave quite differently .",
    "nevertheless , for all regions studied , @xmath108 is always positive immediately below the surface ( @xmath152 ) but negative at deeper regions , which implies that the inward decrease of @xmath66 is faster in an ar with larger mai than in one with smaller mai .",
    "the reason for the faster decrease of @xmath66 under stronger ars could be because the stronger magnetic fields near the surface suppress convection more , resulting in a larger build - up of gas ( _ i.e. _ , higher density and gas pressure ) , which leads to lower @xmath56 in the deeper regions .",
    "it also appears that the so - called quiet regions have deep - seated magnetic effects .",
    "we find that the near - surface @xmath66 of ar@xmath129 and ar@xmath130 , which have largest number of flares among all studied regions , is anomalously low .",
    "we propose two possible reasons to explain the phenomena .",
    "one is that @xmath139 is larger in the flaring ars because , as some theories have proposed , flares might be caused by the larger amount of flux coming from the convection zone .",
    "another possibility is that the relation between @xmath89 and @xmath65 derived from our models may not be suitable for the shallow layers of such highly dynamic and eruptive ars , where the variations in @xmath2 can now come from many sources rather than solely from the magnetic fields as in our models . in either case , the inferred @xmath89 may not reflect the actual value .",
    "our attempt to reproduce the active - region profiles of @xmath65 and @xmath88 suggests that the magnetic fields must be both strong and concentrated in order to produce the positive @xmath88 that is seen in the deeper layers .",
    "additionally , the large , positive @xmath65 commonly seen between @xmath115 and @xmath118 can only be caused by a negative @xmath89 in that region .",
    "the shifting of ionization zones does not produce matching magnitudes and locations of the positive @xmath65 .",
