    "gx 17@xmath02 is a bright low - mass x - ray binary and z source ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) . along",
    "the z track traced out in the x - ray color - color diagram ( cd ) the mass accretion rate ( ) is thought to increase from the horizontal branch ( hb ) , via the normal branch ( nb ) , to the flaring branch ( fb ) . on the hb and upper nb 1860 hz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos )",
    "are present ( called hbos ) , and on the lower nb and fb 520 hz qpos ( n / fbos ) .",
    "atoll sources have no z track in the cd ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) , and do not exhibit hbo or n / fbo .",
    "however , many show khz qpos between 300 and 1200 hz ( see van der klis 1997 for a recent review ) .",
    "usually two simultaneous khz qpos ( hereafter : twin peaks ) are seen , whose frequencies increase with , while their difference ( the twin peak separation ) remains constant . in x - ray bursts oscillations",
    "are seen with a frequency once or twice the twin peak separation .",
    "this strongly suggest a model in which the burst oscillation frequency is the spin frequency ( or twice that ) , the higher khz qpo frequency some inner disk frequency , and the lower khz qpo frequency their beat .",
    "so far , two z sources have shown khz qpos : sco x-1 with frequencies in the range 5501100 hz ( van der klis et al . 1996a ; 1997b ) , and gx 5@xmath21 ( 325896 hz ; van der klis et al .",
    "both sources showed twin peaks . in gx 5@xmath21",
    "the qpo frequencies increased from the left end of the hb to the upper nb ( van der klis et al .",
    "1996b ) , in sco x-1 from the upper nb to the fb ( van der klis et al . 1996a ; 1997b ) .",
    "in view of the similarities between the khz qpos in z and atoll sources , both are most likely caused by the same mechanism .",
    "the only difference so far is that in atoll sources the peak separation is constant , whereas in sco x-1 it decreases when the qpo frequencies increase . in this letter , we report the discovery of twin khz qpos in the z source gx  17@xmath02 ( see also van der klis et al . 1997a ) .",
    "we observed gx 17@xmath02 with the pca onboard the rossi x - ray timing explorer on 68 feb , 14 apr , and 2627 jul 1997 .",
    "a total of 120.5 ksec of good data were obtained . during feb 8 ( 1.1 ksec ) and a small part of feb 7 ( 7.8 ksec ) and",
    "jul 27 ( 4.8 ksec ) only 4 of the 5 detectors were on .",
    "the source then covered parts of the z also well - covered with 5 detectors .",
    "as adding the 4-detector data did not improve the results significantly , we only used the 5-detector data to have the most accurate cd possible .",
    "data were collected with 16 s time resolution in 129 photon energy bands ( energy range 260 kev ) , and simultaneously with 122 @xmath3s time resolution in 4 bands : 25 kev , 56.4 kev , 6.48.6 kev , and 8.660 kev .",
    "we made power density spectra from the 122 @xmath3s data , using 16 s data segments . to measure the khz qpos we fitted the 964096 hz power spectra with a function described by a constant , one or two lorentzian peaks , and a broad sinusoid to represent the dead - time modified poisson noise ( zhang et al .",
    "1995 ; zhang 1995 ) .",
    "the very large event window ( van der klis et al .",
    "1997b ) was set to 55 @xmath3s , so that its effect on the poisson noise was small enough that it could be absorbed by the broad sinusoid . to measure the hbos we fitted the 8256 hz power spectra with a constant , one or two lorentzian peaks , and a power law representing the continuum .",
    "differential dead time ( van der klis 1989 ) was negligible .",
    "we determined errors using @xmath4 and upper limits using @xmath5 , corresponding to a 95% confidence level .",
    "upper limits on the khz qpos were determined using a fixed fwhm ( 100 hz ) . in the presence of one khz peak",
    "the upper limit on the other was determined by fixing its frequency at the frequency of the detected qpo plus or minus the mean peak separation ( depending on whether the lower or higher frequency qpo was detected , respectively ) .",
    "upper limits on the hbo second harmonic were determined using a fixed fwhm ( 10 hz ) and a frequency twice that of the first harmonic .    in the cd and the hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ) we used for the soft color the log of the 3.56.4 kev/2.03.5 kev count rate ratio , for the hard color the log of the 9.716.0 kev/6.49.7 kev ratio , and as intensity the log of the count rates in the 2.016.0 kev band .",
    "we used the s@xmath6 parameterization ( wijnands et al .",
    "1997a , and references therein ) for measuring the position along the z. the hb / nb vertex is at s@xmath6=1.0 , the nb / fb vertex at s@xmath6=2.0 . by using logarithmic values for the colors ,",
    "s@xmath6 does not depend on the values of the colors but only on their variations ( wijnands et al .",
    "we selected the power spectra according to s@xmath6 , and determined the average s@xmath6 for each average power spectrum .",
    "the s@xmath6 error bars represent the standard deviation of the s@xmath6 distributions .",
    "in april the source traced out a full z in the cd and hid ( fig .  [ cd ] ) . in february",
    "the hb / nb vertex and the upper nb were covered , and in july the hb .",
    "the feb data fall right on top of the apr data , indicating that the z did not move appreciably between february and april .",
    "the jul data have higher count rate and higher soft color .",
    "such shifts have been observed before in gx 17@xmath02 by kuulkers et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and also in other z sources ( cyg x-2 : hasinger et al .",
    "1990 ; gx 5@xmath21 : kuulkers et al .",
    "1994 ) . in all observations we detected khz qpos in the 8.660 kev band . in the 6.48.6 kev band",
    "the qpos were not , or marginally , detected . combining both bands",
    "the significance of the qpos increased , although the rms amplitude decreased a little .",
    "therefore , we used the 6.460 kev range for the analysis of the qpos .",
    "we detected the khz qpo only for s@xmath6@xmath7 .",
    "typical power spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ powerspectrum ] .",
    "note the simultaneous presence of the hbo and its harmonic ( upper frame ) , and the khz qpos .",
    "the properties of the qpos as a function of s@xmath6 are shown in fig .",
    "the higher frequency qpos increase in frequency from 645@xmath19 hz at s@xmath6=0.07@xmath10.05 to 1087@xmath112 hz at s@xmath6=1.44@xmath10.05 ( fig.[qpos]a ) , while their rms amplitude and fwhm decrease from 5.7@xmath10.5% to 1.5@xmath10.4% ( fig[qpos]c ) , and from 183@xmath135 hz to 21@xmath120 hz .",
    "above s@xmath6=1.5 the higher frequency qpo is undetectable ( upper limits typically 2.5% rms ) .",
    "for s@xmath6@xmath80.5 the lower frequency qpo is not detected , with upper limits near 2.5% rms .",
    "from s@xmath6=0.56@xmath10.04 to s@xmath6=1.34@xmath10.05 the lower frequency qpo is detected at a frequency increasing from 480@xmath123 hz to 781@xmath111 hz ( fig.[qpos]a ) .",
    "the rms amplitude ( fig.[qpos]e ) and fwhm of the lower frequency qpo are about constant between 23% and 50150 hz .",
    "when both qpos are detected the frequency difference is consistent with being constant at 293.5@xmath17.5 hz .",
    "the qpos were strongest at high energy .",
    "we combined all data with s@xmath6@xmath80.5 ( s@xmath6=0.23@xmath10.14 ) , and with s@xmath6 between 1.0 and 1.3 ( s@xmath6=1.15@xmath10.10 ) to detect the qpos at lower energy .",
    "when s@xmath6@xmath91.0 both qpos are seen .",
    "both get stronger with energy and both have about the same amplitude in each band ( see tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] ) . when s@xmath6@xmath80.5 only the higher frequency qpo is seen .",
    "apart from an overall increase in amplitude its energy dependence is approximately the same as for s@xmath6@xmath91.0 ( see tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the khz qpos and hbo and its second harmonic occur simultaneously ( see fig .",
    "[ powerspectrum ] ) .",
    "the hbo frequency increases from the left end of the hb onto the upper nb ( fig .",
    "[ qpos]b ) . at s@xmath6=1.34@xmath10.05",
    "it reaches a maximum of 61@xmath10.2 hz , further down the nb it decreases again . on the hb the rms amplitude of the fundamental decreases with s@xmath6",
    "; on the nb it is about constant at 1.52% ( fig.[qpos]d ) . above s@xmath6=1.6",
    "it is not detected with upper limits of 2.0% rms .",
    "the rms amplitude of the second harmonic decreases on the hb with s@xmath6 ( fig.[qpos]f ) . a detailed analysis of the hbo and n / fbo will be reported by homan et al .",
    "we detected two simultaneous khz qpos in gx 17@xmath02 .",
    "after sco x-1 ( van der klis et al 1996a ; 1997b ) and gx 5@xmath21 ( van der klis et al .",
    "1996b ) this is the third z source displaying khz qpos .",
    "the qpo frequency increases down the hb and onto the nb . for atoll sources",
    "an increase in frequency is thought to be due to an increase in . due to the very similar properties of the khz qpos in atoll sources and in gx 17@xmath02",
    "our observations confirm that indeed increases when the source moves down the z , even when ( on the nb ) the count rate decreases , as previously concluded by hasinger & van der klis ( 1989 ) .",
    "although the behavior of the x - ray spectra changes significantly at s@xmath6=1 when the source enters the nb , and the x - ray flux begins to decrease with s@xmath6 there , the frequencies of all qpos continue to increase with s@xmath6 in the same manner as on the hb .",
    "the only evidence that the rapid variability is affected as the source enters the nb is by the hbo rms amplitude .",
    "decreasing with s@xmath6 on the hb , the amplitude is about constant on the nb",
    ".    between s@xmath6=1.4 and 1.5 the hbo frequency decreases . a similar decrease in hbo frequency on the nb for gx 17@xmath02",
    "was seen in the `` variable - frequency '' qpo on the nb reported by wijnands et al .",
    "although supporting evidence for a decreasing hbo frequency on the nb was found in ginga data on cygnus x-2 ( wijnands et al .",
    "1997a ) , it was unclear if the `` variable - frequency '' qpo in gx17@xmath02 was indeed the hbo ( see kuulkers et al .",
    "1997 ) . from fig .",
    "[ qpos]b it is now evident that indeed it was , and also that it was the fundamental and not , as proposed by kuulkers et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the second harmonic . the data reported here and by wijnands et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show that the behavior of the hbo did not change significantly over one year . in the data presented here",
    "the hbo does not decrease to the same frequency as in 1996 ; this is due to a lack of data on the nb .",
    "beat - frequency models ( bfms ) are the best models so far to explain the khz qpos in atoll sources . in gx 17@xmath02",
    "khz qpos and hbos are observed simultaneously , so if the magnetospheric bfm explains the hbo ( alpar & shaham 1985 ; lamb et al .",
    "1985 ) it can not explain the khz qpos ( the same is true for sco x-1 ; van der klis et al .",
    "the sonic - point bfm for the khz qpos in atoll sources ( miller , lamb , & psaltis 1997 ) assumes that the highest frequency is due to orbital motion around the neutron star at the sonic radius , and the lower frequency to its beat with the neutron star spin frequency .",
    "this model predicts a constant twin peak separation , as observed for atoll sources .",
    "according to this model the spin period of the neutron star in gx 17@xmath02 would be 3.41@xmath10.03 msec .    in sco x-1",
    "the twin peak separation decreases when the frequencies of the khz qpos increase ( van der klis et al .",
    "although the peak separation in gx 17@xmath02 is consistent with being constant , its error bars are larger than in sco x-1 and a decrease similar to that in sco x-1 can not be excluded ( see fig . [ peak_difference ] ) .",
    "note that the decrease of the peak separation in sco x-1 was observed when this source was moving down the nb onto the beginning of the fb .",
    "we could not observe the khz qpos this far down the z in gx 17@xmath02 .",
    "another explanation that has been proposed for khz qpos is the photon bubble oscillation ( pbo ) model of klein et al .",
    "these oscillations have been modeled to occur below 0.4 l@xmath10 and only weakly ( or not at all ) above 1.1 l@xmath10 ( klein et al .",
    "1996 ; r. klein , private communication 1997 ) .",
    "the amplitudes of the pbos decrease and their frequencies increase with , just as we observe .",
    "however , in calculations so far pbos near 1200 hz occur at 0.4 l@xmath10 , a factor two lower than the inferred luminosity when we observed 1200 hz qpos .",
    "calculations for luminosities between 0.4 and 1.1 l@xmath10 covering a wider range of parameters are needed to compare the properties of the pbos more accurately with the observed properties of the khz qpos in z sources .",
    "gx 17@xmath02 and sco x-1 have similar timing properties .",
    "the highest observed frequency of the khz qpos in both sources is approximately 1100 hz , and the peak separations are more or less equal ( see fig.[peak_difference ] ) .",
    "however , several aspects of the timing behavior differ significantly between the two sources . in sco x-1 the highest frequency for the khz qpos",
    "is observed at the beginning of the fb ( van der klis et al .",
    "1996a ) , but in gx 17@xmath02 this frequency is already reached on the upper nb .",
    "this difference is remarkable , because both sources are thought to reach l@xmath10 near the nb / fb vertex ( i.e. s@xmath6=2 ) .",
    "so , the same frequency is reached in gx17@xmath02 further from the eddington critical value than in sco x-1 .",
    "also , in sco x-1 the frequency of the hbo does not decrease as increases ( van der klis et al .",
    ". wijnands et al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggested that an increase in the mass flux through the radial inflow as gx 17@xmath02 moves down the nb could produce the decrease of mass flux through the inner disk needed in the magnetospheric bfm to explain the observed decrease of the hbo frequency with increasing .",
    "it remains to be seen if indications can be found for a different radial inflow behavior between the two sources , as would be required to explain the difference in the hbo frequency changes with within this framework .",
