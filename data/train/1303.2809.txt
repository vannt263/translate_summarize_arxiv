    "fractional quantum hall effect is typically studied in the limit where the cyclotron energy @xmath0 is large , so one can focus attention on only a single landau level ( ll ) . however , in typical experiments , the interaction energy scale @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the magnetic length , is often on the same order as the cyclotron energy , thus making landau level mixing an important consideration .",
    "historically , the difficulty of including ll mixing into calculations , along with the general belief that ll mixing would change predictions quantitatively , but not qualitatively , has generally prevented researchers from addressing this issue in much detail . relatively recently , however , it became clear that one could not always ignore ll mixing so easily .",
    "crucially , it was pointed out that ll mixing would be _ required _ in order to break the symmetry between two possible ( nonabelian ) quantum hall states that might be realized at @xmath3  the moore - read@xcite state , and the so - called antipfaffian@xcite . in this context",
    ", the current authors used a landau - level truncation scheme to conclude that in typical samples the anti - pfaffian is favored@xcite .",
    "although the experiments are not usually in the limit of small ll mixing , it is nonetheless natural to consider the case where ll mixing is weak . to this end ,",
    "bishara and nayak@xcite used a systematic perturbative approach to obtain corrections to leading order in the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "as pointed out in that work , the effect at leading order can be summarized as being a correction to the two - body@xcite and three - body@xcite pseudopotentials .",
    "these corrections were used in an exact diagonalization study in ref .  .",
    "almost two decades earlier , a seminumerical ll mixing study was undertaken by rezayi and haldane@xcite to obtain the leading perturbative corrections to the two - body interaction .",
    "aware that the three - body interactions would be crucial , in the process of writing ref .",
    ", the current authors explored extending the numerical technique of ref .   to obtain three - body corrections as well  the results of which will be presented in the current paper ( these results also update the results of ref .  , which were necessarily rough given the limited computational ability of the time ) .",
    "unfortunately , we found that at least some of our results disagreed with the published results of bishara and nayak@xcite .",
    "we later supported our numerical results by an analytical calculation valid in the lowest ll , which we present in the appendix of this paper .    in discussions with nayak as well as with matthias troyer",
    ", it was suggested that the disagreement in results was due to a normal - ordering error in ref .  .",
    "( this is now discussed in some detail in ref .  ) .",
    "however , even fixing this error it was not obvious that the analytical results entirely agreed with the numerical calculation .",
    "more recently another fully analytical calculation was performed by sodemann and macdonald@xcite . while the results agreed with our numerical calculation in the lowest ll ( lll )",
    ", some disagreements remained in the first exicted ll ( ll1 ) .",
    "still more recently , peterson and nayak have produced a new manuscript@xcite performing an analytical calculation which now agrees with our numerical results ( their manuscript also discusses finite thickness corrections and graphene , as well as the conventional pure coulomb interaction ) . since these results are controversial , and since it is obviously very easy to obtain incorrect results , we have decided to publish our numerical results to support the conclusions of peterson and nayak . in so doing ,",
    "we will also point out a key potential limitation of the analytic techniques of these references  that they apply only in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the method roughly follows that of ref .  .",
    "we work on a finite sphere with a monopole of strength @xmath5 flux .",
    "we start with some number of completely filled landau levels .",
    "we would like to consider the interactions of @xmath6 or 3 additional electrons added to the next empty ll , which we call the _ valence _ ll .",
    "for the two ( three ) particle case we consider a basis of states with two ( three ) electrons added to the valence ll . for simplicity we consider only states with total @xmath7 , which will be sufficient for our purposes .",
    "one can diagonalize the @xmath8 operator within this space to pick out states with angular momentum @xmath9 which we call @xmath10 where @xmath11 indicates whether we are considering two or three electrons added to the valence ll . while specifying @xmath9 picks out a unique wavefunction for the case of @xmath6 electrons added to the valence ll , for the case of @xmath12 electrons added to the valence ll",
    ", the quantum number @xmath9 alone does not uniquely specify the state for @xmath13 and @xmath14 , in the spin polarized case , and for @xmath15 in the unpolarized case@xcite . in these cases ,",
    "we need additional quantum numbers to specify a specific wavefunction .",
    "although we will not delve into such complexity in the current paper , the described technique can easily be extended to handle these cases as well .",
    "our hamiltonian can be abbreviated as @xmath16 with @xmath17 the kinetic terms and @xmath18 the interaction term which we assume to be purely two - body ( and below we will take this to be of the coulomb form ) .",
    "the above mentioned @xmath10 states all have the same kinetic energy @xmath19",
    "we next apply the interaction to our basis of states @xmath21 it should be noted that these wavefunctions contain components with electrons above the valence ll , as well as holes below the valence ll .",
    "crucially , for numerical work we must truncate the hilbert space that we will consider by not allowing electrons to occupy landau levels above some level @xmath22 . note that written in the standard single electron orbital basis , the number of components contained in a one of these wavefunctions @xmath23 is only polynomially large in @xmath5 and in @xmath22 .",
    "note that the coulomb energy of these wavefunctions without considering ll mixing can be written as @xmath24 for the case of @xmath6 electrons in a valence ll , these values are precisely the pseudopotentials in the absence of ll mixing .",
    "they are proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "the leading ll mixing correction to the energy of the @xmath26 state is then given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 projects to the space where @xmath29 . in the case of @xmath6 electron @xmath30",
    "is precisely the leading ll mixing correction to the @xmath31 pseudopotentials .",
    "these energies are proportional to @xmath32 .",
    "note that in the _ results _ section below we will always quote energies in units of @xmath33 .    for the @xmath12 electron case",
    ", we want to find the  irreducible \" part of the three - body interaction  that is , the part of the energy shift that can not be accounted for by a correction to the two - body pseudopotential .",
    "we first calcualte @xmath31 and @xmath30 .",
    "we then consider a modified coulomb interaction within the single valence ll that consists only of @xmath34 and contains no ll mixing terms .",
    "we then evaluate the shift in @xmath35 resulting from having added @xmath30 to the bare pseudopotential @xmath31 .",
    "this shift is subtracted from @xmath36 to give the irreducible three body pseudopotential .",
    "note that obtaining the three - body term thus requires obtaining the two - body term first .",
    "the described technique determines the leading order ll - mixing corrections to the interaction .",
    "however , we must recall that we have truncated the hilbert space to a finite number of ll s and we must numerically extrapolate to infinite @xmath22 .",
    "finally , since we are interested in comparing to results derived for large ( planar ) systems , we must also extrapolate to the limit of large @xmath37 corresponding to a large sphere .",
    "thus , the numerical results presented below are the results of a double extrapolation .",
    "note however if pseudopotentials are to be used on finite sized systems , for consistency , it is preferable to use pseudopotentials explicitly derived for the system size in question . we will discuss this issue further below .    .",

    "all numerical results will be quoted in units of @xmath33 . to avoid having to worry about electron self - energies ( which may converge more slowly ) it is more convenient to keep track of differences in pseudopotential coefficients .",
    "this is natural given that adding a common constant to all pseudopotential coefficients gives an overall shift in energy but leaves the eigenstates of the hamiltonian unchanged . to calibrate our technique , we consider the two body pseudopotential in the lowest ll ( lll ) as shown in the top of fig .",

    "the agreement between numerics ( this work ) and analytics ( refs .  ) is quite good , whereas in ll1 , the agreement is much less good .",
    "to examine this situation a bit more closely , we show an example of some of the extrapolations in fig .  [",

    "nonetheless , given the uncertainties in the extrapolation , the agreement with the analytic results appears acceptable .",
    "the fact that the convergence with system size is somewhat worse in ll1 than in lll is to be expected being that all correlation lengths are larger in ll1 ( the single particle wavefunctions are in some sense  fatter \" ) .",
    "in addition , working in ll1 is far more computationally demanding than in lll since one needs to account for a far greater variety of excitations that involve exciting electrons out of the fully filled landau levels ( including both spin species ) .",
    "this has limited our numerical calculations in ll1 to somewhat smaller systems . while these particular calculations were performed on a not - very - powerful computer ,",
    "the results are clear enough to demonstrate the general trends , and also to confirm agreement with analytic work by other authors .",
    "the slow convergence of the three - body potential raises a serious issue . to a large extent ,",
    "the purpose of deriving pseudopotentials is to use them for numerical exact diagonalizations for finite systems .",
    "however , there is a clear inconsistency in using pseudopotentials derived in the thermodynamic limit for exact diagonalizations of a finite sized system .",
    "while the size dependence of the two - body pseudopotentials is relatively minor , the size dependence of the three - body term appears to be very significant .",
    "this is also true for the lll as well ( perhaps to a slightly lesser extent ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plots3 ] .",
    "this raises the possibility that , for cases where the three - body potential is important in determining the physics , one will not see the true thermodynamic behavior until very large system size .",
    "we suggest that finite size extrapolations may have fewer errors if diagonalizations of a given size system use pseudopotentials designed for that particular size .",
    "to elaborate on the issue of extrapolation , we recall the work of ref .  .",
    "there it was pointed out that extrapolation converges rapidly if ( a ) one uses interaction ( such as chord distance ) appropriate for each particular size system and ( b ) one rescales the interaction strength to keep the charge density constant . for this reason , in the history of quantum hall numerics ,",
    "the vast majority of calculations have used pseudopotentials derived for each particular system size in question .",
    "while we can not say with certainty that other schemes may not be made to work , it seems very risky to throw out the inherent consistency of this established approach .     in the lll .",
    "the extrapolated values is .0214 note that there the value of the pseudopotential taken at finite @xmath5 can be quite different from the thermodynamic limit.,width=288 ]",
    "the ll mixing corrections presented here should be of value in the analysis of physical systems where ll mixing terms are weak ( very high density quantum hall samples ) .",
    "moreover , the results here have been used to independently establish the validity of analytical results of ref .   and some of the results of ref .  .",
    "finally , we point out a potential inconsistency in using pseudopotentials derived in the thermodynamic limit for calculations on finite systems .",
