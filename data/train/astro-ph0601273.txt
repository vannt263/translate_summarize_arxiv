    "1993 ) .    in this paper , we report a new independent estimate of the central mass that uses the young massive stars at @xmath0  pc as test particles . a remarkable property of these stars has been discovered recently : they form a disk - like population ( levin & beloborodov 2003 ; genzel et al .",

    "the clockwise disk is especially well pronounced .",
    "it has about 30 members and a small thickness @xmath11 .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the orbital motions of stars in the clockwise disk and infer the central gravitating mass . as a tool of our mass estimate we use orbital roulette , a recently developed statistical method ( beloborodov & levin 2004 , hereafter bl04 ) .",
    "this method is generally more precise than the estimators based on the virial theorem and provides a statistically well - defined way to quantify the uncertainty of the mass estimate .",
    "the disk - like structure of the young stellar population is not evident when it is observed in projection : the line - of - sight coordinaties @xmath12 of the stars are unknown .",
    "this structure , however , is evident in the distribution of the measured 3d velocities . in particular , the velocity vectors of stars that move clockwise on the sky cluster near a particular plane . this may be only if the orbits of stars are near this plane and form a disk - like population .",
    "the clockwise disk has a small thickness at angular distances @xmath13 from .",

    "the deviations of individual stellar velocities from the midplane are shown in figure  1 . hereafter in this paper we use the sample of stars between 0.7 `` and 5 '' with firmly detected clockwise rotation @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the measurement error in @xmath19 .",
    "the sample has 28 stars , which is sufficiently large to study the distribution of velocity deviations from the disk midplane ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the deviation angles @xmath20 are defined by @xmath21 .",
    "the observed distribution of @xmath22 may be fitted by a disk population model .",

    "we calculate this distribution using monte - carlo technique , including a simulation of observational errors .",
    "we randomly draw @xmath26 orbits from the model population and choose a randomly directed vector of length @xmath27 in each orbital plane @xmath28 .",
    "this gives 28 simulated velocities @xmath29 .",

    "2006 are used ) . finally , deviations @xmath20 of velocities @xmath29 from the disk midplane are calculated .",
    "this simulation is repeated @xmath32 times , which gives the accurate distribution of @xmath22 predicted by the model as well as the average values @xmath33 and @xmath34 as functions of @xmath25 .",

    "the actual distribution of @xmath48 is shown in figure  3 .",
    "one can see that the circular hypothesis implies orbital inclinations that are inconsistent with the found thickness of the disk .",
    "a significant fraction of the disk stars must have non - negligible eccentricities .",
    "a circular orbit would provide a straightforward estimate of the central mass @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , circular motion implies a simple relation between @xmath3 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 : @xmath52 .",

    "we find the mean @xmath46 and its dispersion @xmath67 using about @xmath68 realizations .",
    "the deduced 3d positions together with the measured 3d velocities give 6d information for each star .",
    "then the velocities @xmath69 and @xmath70 may be deduced , where @xmath51 and @xmath40 are polar coordinates in the orbital plane of the star .",
    "the measurement errors of @xmath29 and the uncertainty in the individual orbital planes imply errors @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",

    "the results are summarized in table  1 and illustrated in figure  4 .",
    "the orbital periods of stars at @xmath74  pc are thousands of years , and it is presently impossible to trace any significant fraction of the orbits .",

    "such a method must take into account the possible errors in @xmath43 and @xmath29 .",
    "a traditional mass estimate would be based on the virial theorem , [ eq : vir ] m=. the virial relation gives @xmath75 .",
    "one faces difficulties , however , when trying to define the error of this estimate ( see bl04 for discussion ) .",
    "a major assumption in the derivation of the virial relation  ( [ eq : vir ] ) is that the stars have random orbital phases . bl04",

    "we take into account the uncertainties using monte - carlo technique : many random realizations of the data set @xmath77 are generated and studied .",

    "each realization of the data set @xmath77 is analyzed by the roulette estimator as described in bl04 .",
    "the analysis aims to accept or rule out a trial potential @xmath78 at a chosen confidence level . given @xmath79 and a data set @xmath77 one can reconstruct all @xmath26 orbits and find the time orbital phases @xmath80 of the stars .",

    "here we use its simplest version based on the analysis of the mean phase @xmath84 .",
    "the true @xmath3 must satisfy the condition [ eq : roul ] |g(m)=0.5(12n)^-1/2 .",
    "if @xmath79 is too small then @xmath85 , i.e. all stars will be found near the pericenter , while too large @xmath79 will give @xmath86 , i.e. all stars will sit near apocenter .",

[ eq : roul ] ) .    in our monte - carlo simulation , @xmath88 that is found for a realization of the data set @xmath77 is compared with @xmath89 found for a realization of a fair roulette @xmath90 .",
    "the statistics of this comparison is accumulated for @xmath68 random realizations .",
    "thus , the probability @xmath91 of @xmath92 is accurately found .",
    "the probability @xmath93 is monotonically increasing with @xmath79 since larger masses imply larger orbital phases ( closer to the apocenter ) .",

    "the found functions @xmath98 are shown in figure  5 .",
    "the confidence intervals for @xmath3 are between the two curves .",
    "for example , the 80% confidence interval ( @xmath99 ) is @xmath100 .",
    "the confidence intervals approximately correspond to a gaussian distribution with standard deviation @xmath101 , and we can summarize the result as @xmath102 .",
    "we have also checked the distribution of @xmath80 for the found @xmath3 .",
    "it is consistent with the expected flat distribution ; this is verified using the anderson - darling measure ( see bl04 ) .",
    "we conclude that the observed stellar motions are consistent with kepler potential @xmath103 with @xmath102 .",
    "there are two sources of systematic error of our result .",
    "first , we had to chose a disk - population model in the calculations .",
    "we specified the midplane ( normal @xmath49 ) and the gaussian distribution of orbital inclinations around the midplane with dispersion @xmath25 .",
    "the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath25 have been derived by fitting the 3d velocity data and have finite errors .",
    "the obtained @xmath3 is most sensitive to @xmath104 which determines the disk inclination to the line of sight .",
    "our best - fit disk has @xmath105 ; larger @xmath106 would imply smaller sizes of the orbits and hence smaller @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath104 as large as @xmath107 may still be consistent with the velocity data ( paumard et al .",
    "2006 ) , and it would change our estimate to @xmath108 .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 has the error of @xmath109 .",
    "the choice of @xmath110 instead of @xmath59 would broaden the confidence intervals by a factor @xmath111 .",
    "the second possible source of error is the distance to the galactic center @xmath4 which we assumed to be 8  kpc .",
    "the mass estimate depends on @xmath4 because the proper velocities @xmath112 and positions @xmath113 scale linearly with @xmath4 ( @xmath114 is not affected as its measurement is based on the doppler effect ) . the midplane of the disk varies little and may be assumed constant to a first approximation",
    ". then the deduced radial positions @xmath51 of the stars scale linearly with @xmath4 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath4 may be derived using a toy problem with @xmath115 stars moving in the disk midplane on a circular orbit of radius @xmath116 .",
    "the true and deduced masses are then given by @xmath117 @xmath118.\\ ] ] after averaging over @xmath119 stars and taking into account that @xmath120 and @xmath121 , we find [ eq : scale ] m(0true)=m(8  kpc)^-1 .",
    "we have empirically checked this dependence by repeating the roulette simulation for various @xmath4 ( as small as 7  kpc ) .",
    "the obtained @xmath122 are well described by a simple shift of @xmath3 according to equation  ( [ eq : scale ] ) . in particular",
    ", @xmath123  kpc ( eisenhauer et al . 2005 ) would give @xmath124 .",
    "table  1 shows the eccentricities of reconstructed star orbits for @xmath2  kpc and the best - fit central mass @xmath125 .",
    "the errors @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) are caused by uncertainties @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "the errors are found using the monte - carlo simulation that is similar to the estimation of @xmath67 ( see   2.3 ) .",
    "this simulation gives the probability distribution @xmath130 for each @xmath131 .",
    "a non - zero eccentricity is detected if @xmath132 and accurately measured if @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the mean of @xmath130 and @xmath126 is its dispersion .",
    "if distribution @xmath130 is broad ( large errors ) , its mean represents the errors rather than the true @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , @xmath134 is an accurate estimate of eccentricity only if the distribution @xmath130 is sufficiently narrow , @xmath135 .",
    "table  1 shows @xmath136 for stars with @xmath137 . for stars with @xmath138 we give @xmath139 as an upper limit .",
    "the obtained values are consistent with the results of paumard et al .",
    "( 2006 ) where eccentricities are estimated with another method .",
    "the reconstructed orbits of stars in the clockwise disk depend on the assumed central mass @xmath3 . in particular , the star orbital phases depend on @xmath3 .",
    "we have used this dependence to estimate @xmath3 : the true @xmath3 must give time phases consistent with a uniform distribution .",
    "this is the first practical application of orbital roulette , a new method of estimating the gravitational potential from instantaneous motions of test bodies ( bl04 ) .",
    "the obtained estimate @xmath140 is consistent with the recent estimates based on the maps of orbits of s stars in the very vicinity of the center ( @xmath141  pc ) .",
    "the independent estimate presented here uses different stars at @xmath142  pc and is complementary to the small - scale estimates .",
    "it measures the total mass within @xmath143  pc which may include stars and dark matter .",
    "the approximate equality of the masses within the central 0.1  pc and 0.01  pc implies an upper bound on the mass between 0.01 and 0.1  pc : @xmath144 .",
    "this constrains a possible cusp of the stellar population around the cenral black hole as well as the dark - matter content of the central region .",
    "further observations may provide a better constraint or resolve @xmath145 .",
    "the data shows an inner cutoff of the disk population at a radius @xmath146  pc ( see fig .  1 and paumard et al .",
    "the observed peak of the population at @xmath143  pc supports the hypothesis that the young stars were born in a gravitationally unstable accretion disk ( lb03 ) .",
    "the found geometrical thickness of the clockwise stellar population @xmath147 ( eq .  [ eq : h ] ) does not imply that it was born with this @xmath148 .",
    "the parent accretion disk was likely thinner , and its stellar remnant have thickened with time .",
    "the age of the stellar population , @xmath149 million years , should be compared with the timescale of diffusion of orbital parameters .",
    "the latter may be written as t_diff~0.1 , where @xmath150 is a characteristic mass of the objects that dominate fluctuations of the gravitational potential , @xmath151 is their mass density averaged over the considered region @xmath152  pc , and @xmath153 is the total number of these objects . in a uniform stellar core of total mass @xmath154 , the fluctuations would be dominated by low - mass stars , whose total number is @xmath155 . substituting the observed characteristic velocity , @xmath156  km / s , one would find @xmath157  yr@xmath158 .",
    "however , the galactic center is not uniform .",
    "the two stellar disks and stellar clusters are observed , which significantly perturb the gravitational potential .",
    "these perturbations should strongly reduce @xmath159 .",
    "for example ,",
    "if 1/30 of the core mass resides in @xmath160 objects with @xmath161 then @xmath162  yr . the corresponding acquired thickness of the stellar disk is @xmath163 in agreement with the observed value . a similar estimate for @xmath159 may be derived from the interaction between the two young disks ( nayakshin et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the eccentricities of disk stars must also diffuse with time .",
    "if the stars were born on circular orbits then @xmath164 are expected to develop as the disk thickens to @xmath165 .",
    "table  1 shows that a significant fraction of the young stars in the clockwise disk have relatively large eccentricities .",
    "the data are at best marginally consistent with the hypothesis that the stars used to have circular orbits 6 million years ago , and we leave a detailed analysis to a future work .",
    "note that the stars may have been born in a gaseous disk that was not completely circularized : the circularization time was longer than the timescale for star formation .",
    "then the initial eccentricities @xmath166 of the stars are non - zero . besides",
    ", the interaction of stars with the disk might have influenced @xmath166 before the disk was gone .",
    "an alternative scenario assumes that the stars were originally bound to an inspiralling intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ; hansen & milosavljevic 2003 ) , so that the observed disk plane is associated with the orbital plane of the imbh . in this scenario ,",
    "the inspiralling young cluster was stripped by the tidal field of and left a disk of stars with a small dispersion of orbital planes .",
    "calculations of levin , wu , & thommes ( 2005 ) show that the stripped stars can generally have eccentric orbits",
