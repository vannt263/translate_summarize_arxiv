    "recently , it was proposed that a k@xmath1 meson can be deeply bound in light nuclei as a discrete state , such as @xmath5he+k@xmath1 , @xmath6he+k@xmath1 and @xmath7be+k@xmath1 , where the k@xmath1 meson makes the nucleus shrink drastically to form a dense state @xcite .",
    "exotic proton - rich bound systems with k , such as ppk@xmath1 , pppk@xmath1 , pppnk@xmath1 and @xmath4b+k@xmath1 , are expected to be produced in ( k@xmath1 , @xmath8 ) reactions @xcite . in our previous paper , we investigated kaonic nuclei , which are denoted as k nuclei hereafter , @xmath5he+k@xmath1 and @xmath7be+k@xmath1 , with a simple version of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) @xcite .",
    "although our results are similar to those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , a strange property appeared in @xmath7be+k@xmath1 .",
    "it is an isovector deformation , which means that the proton distribution differs from the neutron one in spite of @xmath9 .",
    "thus , k nuclei seem to provide interesting phenomena and stimulate further studies .",
    "apparently , these interesting properties of k nuclei can be attributed to the kn interaction .",
    "especially , the @xmath0 kn interaction plays an essential role . according to a precise experiment @xcite",
    ", the 1s atomic state of a kaonic hydrogen ( i.e. proton+k@xmath1 ) is shown to be shifted upward .",
    "this upward shift , which is consistent with the low - energy scattering data of kn @xcite , suggests that the kn interaction is strongly attractive , so that the system of a k@xmath1 and a proton has a nuclear bound state which corresponds to the @xmath0 @xmath10 hyperon resonance lying at 27 mev below the k@xmath1p threshold . in a boson exchange potential model",
    ", the j@xmath11lich group @xcite showed that all of the @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 mesons work coherently to give a strong attraction between a k and an n which accommodates a k@xmath1-p bound state , identified as @xmath10 .",
    "studies based on chiral su(3 ) @xcite also show that the @xmath0 kn interaction is attractive enough to form a @xmath10 . in this paper",
    "we employ a phenomenological kn interaction @xcite , whose @xmath15-matrix in the kn channel is similar to that led by chiral su(3 ) theory .",
    "since the @xmath0 kn interaction is much more attractive than the @xmath16 one , a k@xmath1 meson attracts protons rather than neutrons , causing an isovector deformation .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 kn interaction is essential for studying k nuclei .    in this paper",
    "we present systematic studies of k nuclei with amd . since amd treats a system in a fully microscopic way without any assumption concerning the structure of the system , it is suitable for studying k nuclei , whose structures might be exotic .",
    "the simple version of amd @xcite , however , has a technical problem in treating the @xmath0 kn interaction , which dominates k nuclear systems : it can not include the degree of freedom of k@xmath2 , and fails to describe the @xmath0 kn state .",
    "therefore , in our previous paper we dealt with the @xmath0 kn interaction by incorporating its k@xmath2n part effectively into the k@xmath1p interaction . of course , the @xmath0 kn interaction should be treated as precisely as possible , because it plays an essential role in k nuclei . in this paper , we improve the framework of amd so that it can treat the @xmath0 kn interaction adequately .",
    "we introduce the degree of freedom of k@xmath2 into the model space of amd ( `` pk@xmath1/nk@xmath2 mixing '' ) .",
    "since k nuclear states depend largely on their isospin due to the strong isospin - dependence of the kn interaction , we carry out the isospin projection as well as the angular momentum projection ( `` @xmath17 & @xmath18 projections '' ) of the obtained intrinsic state .    with the new version of amd , we systematically investigate a variety of k nuclei .",
    "we try to answer the following questions : i ) what k nuclei are deeply bound with narrow widths ?",
    "ii ) is there any strange structure peculiar to k nuclei ?    this paper is composed as follows : in section [ formalism ] , we present the improvements of amd ; pk@xmath1/nk@xmath2 mixing , @xmath17 & @xmath18 projections , and other formalisms . in section",
    "[ tests of our method ] , we demonstrate the capability of our new framework , and then apply it to various k nuclei ( ppnk@xmath1 , pppk@xmath1 , pppnk@xmath1 , @xmath3bek@xmath1 , and @xmath4bk@xmath1 ) . the results and a discussion are given in section [ results ] .",
    "we summarize our study in section [ summary ] .",
    "in the present study , we employ the amd approach as a means of studying k nuclei . it has succeeded in studying the structures of light unstable nuclei @xcite . in particular ,",
    "it is powerful for investigating the global properties of many light nuclei systematically . we know that various few - body methods , such as summarized in @xcite , can treat few - body k nuclei more accurately than amd .",
    "compared with these usual methods , amd is more handy and applicable to more complex nuclei . our aim is a systematic study of a variety of k nuclei .    in the simple version of amd employed in our previous study , we restricted its model space to the proton , neutron and k@xmath1 meson . due to the lack of k@xmath2 in the model space",
    ", we could not describe the @xmath0 kn state , @xmath19 in other words , we could not precisely treat the coupling of the pk@xmath1 pair with the nk@xmath2 one through the @xmath0 kn interaction in the particle basis treatment of amd . in the previous study , we incorporated all contributions from the @xmath0 kn interaction into an effective k@xmath1p interaction , as follows : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are some constants determined by counting the number of @xmath0 pairs and @xmath16 ones in a given state of total isospin @xmath18 .",
    "for example , we set @xmath23 in the case of ppnk@xmath1 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "however , we have to check how this prescription is reliable for various k nucleus cases . for this purpose",
    ", we introduce the degree of freedom of k@xmath2 into the amd framework to treat `` pk@xmath1/nk@xmath2 mixing '' directly .",
    "first , we explain our idea for the simple case of a k nucleus ppnk@xmath1 . in this k nucleus , the component of pnnk@xmath2 is mixed because a pair of pk@xmath1 is replaced with that of nk@xmath2 by the @xmath0 kn interaction .",
    "hereafter , we express this state as @xmath25h . an ordinary way to treat it is to perform a coupled channel calculation , preparing several slater determinants for both channels of ppnk@xmath1 and pnnk@xmath2 . in the present paper",
    ", we deal with such systems where several channels are coupled as follows : in stead of multi slater determinants , we employ a single slater determinant with _ charge - mixed _ single particle wave functions , i.e. @xmath26 and @xmath27 indicate a single nucleon wave function and a k meson wave function , respectively .",
    "@xmath28 can describe the state where a proton and a neutron are mixed , and also @xmath29 can describe the state where k@xmath1 and k@xmath2 are mixed . with these wave functions we describe @xmath25h as @xmath30 k \\rangle$ ] .",
    "this state contains the component of @xmath31 as well as that of @xmath32 . in this method , since each nucleon has a chance to be a proton or a neutron , the important channel is automatically chosen in the process of the energy variation . in addition , we expect that @xmath30 k \\rangle$ ] can represent a state in which the contribution of several configurations is coherently additive : for example , if two configurations such as @xmath33 and @xmath34 work coherently , such state is represented as @xmath35 .",
    "however , we remark one point : @xmath30 k \\rangle$ ] is likely to have incorrect components , for example pppk@xmath1 , ppnk@xmath2 and so on , which should not couple with @xmath25h . to avoid the mixing of such incorrect components , we project it onto a state",
    "whose isospin - z component @xmath36 is equal to that of @xmath25h .",
    "now , we show the details of our wave function based on the concept of pk@xmath1/nk@xmath2 mixing . our nucleon wave function , @xmath37 ,",
    "is represented by the superposition of several gaussian wave packets @xcite , @xmath38\\ ;     namely , the @xmath39-th nucleon is described by the superposition of @xmath40 gaussian wave packets whose centers are @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 means a spin wave function , and is @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 means an isospin wave function , and has the following form : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a variational parameter . in the usual amd",
    "the isospin of each nucleon does not change , i.e. in the process of energy - variation the protons remain as protons and the neutrons as neutrons .",
    "however , in the present paper we make the isospins of all nucleons changeable so that we can treat pk@xmath1/nk@xmath2 mixing . in the same way",
    ", a k meson wave function , @xmath48 , has the form @xmath49\\ ;     isospin wave function of a k , @xmath50 , as well as that of a nucleon , is changeable , @xmath51    because a nucleon is a fermion , we antisymmetrize the wave function of the nucleon s system , @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "then , the k meson wave function is combined to it , @xmath53    if we perform an energy - variation with a trial wave function ( [ eq : pty ] ) , it is likely that the z - component of the isospin ( @xmath36 ) of the total system is different from that of a k nucleus that we try to calculate originally . to avoid any mixing of components having an incorrect @xmath36 , we project the total system onto an eigen - state of @xmath36 before the energy - variation , @xmath54 | \\phi^\\pm \\rangle .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , we can obtain a wave function containing only the components of @xmath55 .",
    "we utilize @xmath56 as a trial wave function .",
    "our wave function includes complex number parameters @xmath57 @xmath58 and a real number parameter ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "these are determined by the frictional cooling equation , as mentioned in   [ cooling eq . ] .",
    "in the present study , we use a common width parameter ( @xmath59 ) of a gaussian wave packet for a nucleon and for a k meson so as to simplify our calculation .",
    "however , it seems natural that the spreading width of a nucleon is different from that of a k meson .",
    "we take this point into account by using different numbers of gaussian wave packets for a nucleon and a k meson , i.e. @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : n ] ) is not equal to @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : k ] ) .      the angular momentum projection ( @xmath17 projection )",
    "is necessary to study k nuclei as well as that of usual nuclei .",
    "in addition , the isospin projection ( @xmath18 projection ) also seems to be important because the kn interaction has strong isospin - dependence .",
    "therefore , we perform angular - momentum and isospin projections simultaneously .",
    "@xmath17 projection is done numerically by rotating the system in space , as has often been done .",
    "@xmath18 projection is performed in quite the same way , but by rotating in isospin space .",
    "our @xmath17 & @xmath18 projections are as follows : @xmath61 is the intrinsic wave function , which is already determined by the frictional cooling equation , as shown in   [ cooling eq . ] .",
    "we calculate various expectation values with @xmath62 .",
    "our hamiltonian in amd calculations , @xmath63 is composed of the kinetic energy @xmath64 , the effective nn potential @xmath65 , the coulomb force @xmath66 , and the effective kn potential @xmath67 . the center - of - mass motion energy , @xmath68 , is subtracted . in the kinetic energy and the center - of - mass motion energy ,",
    "we treat the mass difference between a nucleon and a k meson correctly .",
    "for example , the kinetic energy is @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 indicate the mass of a nucleon and that of k@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the coulomb force is represented by the superposition of seven - range gaussians @xcite .    in the study of k nuclei ,",
    "we do not use existing effective interactions which may be justified for studying phenomena around the normal density . since the system is likely to become extremely dense due to the strong k attraction",
    ", we employ the @xmath72-matrix method @xcite .",
    "we adopt the tamagaki potential ( opeg ) @xcite as a bare nn interaction , and the akaishi - yamazaki kn potential@xcite as a bare kn interaction . because the tamagaki potential can reproduce nn phase shifts up to 660 mev in the lab .",
    "@xcite , we expect that it can be applied to such extremely dense states .",
    "the effective nn / kn interactions constructed from the bare ones are represented by the following ten - range gaussians : @xmath73 \\label{eq : vnn } \\\\",

    "the deepest thresholds for @xmath3bek@xmath1 , @xmath7bek@xmath1 and @xmath4bk@xmath1 are ppnk@xmath1+@xmath5he ( 125.3 mev ) , ppnk@xmath1+@xmath21+n ( 143.5 mev ) and @xmath7bek@xmath1+p ( 159.0 mev ) , while their total binding energies are 131.7 mev , 159.0 mev and 173.5 mev , respectively",
    ". therefore , @xmath3bek@xmath1 , @xmath7bek@xmath1 and @xmath4bk@xmath1 are stable for the strong interaction .",
    "as mentioned above , the k@xmath1 meson is bound by about 100 mev in all of the k nuclei that we calculated .",
    "pk@xmath1 is bound by 27 mev based on the initial assertion that it forms @xmath10 , and ppk@xmath1 is bound by 48 mev according to @xcite .",
    "therefore , the binding energy of the k@xmath1 meson seems to be saturated in k nuclei heavier than ppnk@xmath1 .",
    "we think that this saturation of the binding energy is related to the range of the kn interaction .",
    "since it is very short , the number of nucleons which a single k@xmath1 meson can interact with is limited .",

    "<S> the improved points are 1 ) pk@xmath1/nk@xmath2 mixing and 2 ) total spin and isospin projections . </S>",
    "<S> these improvements enable us to investigate various kaonic nuclei ( ppnk@xmath1 , pppk@xmath1 , pppnk@xmath1 , @xmath3bek@xmath1 and @xmath4bk@xmath1 ) systematically . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that they are deeply bound and extremely dense with a variety of shapes . </S>"
