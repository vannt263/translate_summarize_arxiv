    "the _ kepler _ space telescope has produced more than @xmath1 nearly uninterrupted high - precision light curves @xcite that enable detection of minute astrophysical effects . as of 2014 june ,",
    "analysis of these light curves yielded the discovery of more than 4200 planetary candidates @xcite through detection by the transit method @xcite , of which more than 900 have been verified as planets by various methods @xcite . for such transiting planets , the orbital period , inclination , and radii of the star and planet , relative to the semimajor axis ,",
    "are directly measurable through analysis of the transit shape ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , there are additional astrophysical effects that produce flux variations along the orbital phase of a star - planet system , which depend on , and thus probe , additional properties of the planet .",
    "such out - of - transit phase modulations are the result of three main stellar and planetary effects : beaming , ellipsoidal , and reflection ( beer ) .",
    "the beaming effect , sometimes called doppler boosting , causes an increase ( decrease ) of the brightness of any light source approaching ( receding from ) the observer @xcite , with an amplitude proportional to the radial velocity ( rv ) of the source .",
    "therefore , the stellar rv modulation due to a circular - orbit planet will produce a sine - like beaming phase modulation at the orbital period , if midtransit is defined as the phase zero point .",
    "the ellipsoidal effect @xcite is due to the tidal distortion of the star by the gravity of the planet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , resulting in a cosine - like phase modulation at half the orbital period , for a circular - orbit planet under the same phase - zero definition .",
    "the amplitudes of the beaming and the ellipsoidal modulations for a transiting planet are _ both _ proportional to the planet mass , which can not be probed by the transit method , thus providing an important insight into the planet composition .",
    "the reflection / emission variation , on the other hand , is a result of light scattered off the planet dayside combined with light absorbed and later thermally reemitted by the planet atmosphere at different wavelengths @xcite .",
    "this effect probes properties associated with the planet atmosphere response to its host - star radiation , such as the bond albedo , scattered light geometric albedo , and heat redistribution parameters , among others . the reflection",
    "/ emission phase modulation is expected to behave approximately as a cosine wave at the orbital period for a circular orbit .    in case",
    "the beaming , reflection , and ellipsoidal effects modulate as sine and cosine at the orbital period , and cosine at half the orbital period , respectively , their functions are orthogonal along the orbital phase , thus enabling the measuring of each of the effects amplitudes without interference from the other effects . as a result , the mass of a transiting planet can be independently estimated by either the beaming or the ellipsoidal amplitudes .",
    "such a derivation was performed for koi-13 @xcite , hat - p-7 @xcite ,",
    "tres-2 @xcite , and kepler-76b @xcite . interestingly , in all cases , except for the @xcite analysis of tres-2 , the beaming - derived planetary mass estimate was significantly higher than the ellipsoidal - derived estimate . in addition , rv measurements , available for hat - p-7 , tres-2 , and kepler-76 @xcite , show spectroscopic rv amplitudes that are significantly smaller than the beaming - derived rv ones , pointing to puzzling inflated beaming amplitudes .",
    "@xcite suggested that the inflated photometric beaming amplitude of kepler-76 may be the result of a phase shift of the reflection signal , due to the superrotation phenomenon .",
    "@xcite predicted , through three - dimensional atmospheric circulation model and simulations , that tidally locked , short - period planets develop fast eastward , or _ superrotating _",
    ", equatorial jet streams that in some cases displace the hottest regions by @xmath2 longitude from the substellar point , resulting in a phase shift of the thermal emission phase curve of the planet .",
    "the existence of such a phase shift , due to superrotating equatorial jets , was confirmed through infrared phase curve observations of hd 189733 @xcite that showed that the maximum flux occurred several hours before secondary eclipse .",
    "later , this phenomenon was further demonstrated by many numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in recent years",
    "significant progress has been made in understanding the superrotation phenomenon through semianalytic and linear approximation models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . alternatively ,",
    "high - altitude optically reflective clouds located westward of the substellar point may result in opposite - direction phase shift , as detected and explained by @xcite for kepler-7b and also by @xcite for kepler-12b and kepler-43b .",
    "close to the submission date of this paper @xcite published a comprehensive phase curve analysis of @xmath3 _ kepler _ hot jupiters and found that in @xmath4 of them a phase shift of the planetary light offsets its peak from the substellar point .",
    "they concluded that eastward phase shifts dominate light from hotter planets ( kepler-76b and hat - p-7b ) , while westward phase shifts dominate light from cooler planets ( kepler-7b , kepler-8b , kepler-12b , kepler-41b and kepler-43b ) .",
    "the present paper extends the superrotation hypothesis by @xcite and suggests that in addition to kepler-76 this idea may be applicable to koi-13 , hat - p-7 , and tres-2 .",
    "we show that if such a superrotation - induced phase shift is present in the _ kepler _ light curve , it should show up in the basic beer phase curve model mainly as an apparently inflated beaming amplitude .",
    "we present the details and results of the new superrotation beer model that provides a photometry - consistent estimate of the planetary mass .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 presents the basic beer model of a transiting planet assuming either a geometric or lambertian reflection / emission phase function , and section  3 presents the superrotation beer model , which models also the superrotation - induced phase shift of the reflection / emission modulation .",
    "section  4 then describes the analysis of the _ kepler _ light curves of koi-13 , hat - p-7 , tres-2 , and kepler-76 ; section  5 lists the parameters of the systems from the literature used in this paper and describes how additional stellar and planetary parameters were derived from them ; and section  6 presents the results of the superrotation beer models for the four systems .",
    "section  7 follows by discussing the relation between the _ kepler_-band - derived phase shift and the thermal emission phase shift , section  8 compares our results with those of previous studies and section  9 summarizes and discusses the findings of this work .",
    "we start with modeling the phase modulation of a circular - orbit transiting planet .",
    "for such a planet we define the beer model as a modification to the method described by @xcite .",
    "first we define the orbital phase as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the orbital period and @xmath7 is the midtransit time .",
    "we then calculate , using robust linear fit @xcite , the first five fourier series coefficients of the cleaned and detrended light curve @xcite , @xmath8 where the signs are defined so that the coefficients are expected to be positive , though the fit can result in any sign for them .    in our approximation",
    "we express the relative flux modulation of the system due to a circular - orbit planet , as a result of the beer effects , as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the relative flux zero point ; @xmath11 is the orbital inclination angle ; @xmath12 is the star ",
    "observer angle ; @xmath13 is the reflection / thermal emission phase function , which includes a @xmath14 dependence ; and @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the reflection / emission , beaming and ellipsoidal semiamplitudes , respectively , which are expected to be positive . for the beer effect amplitudes we use",
    "@xcite @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the star rv semiamplitude ; @xmath22 is the orbital semimajor axis ; @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are the mass and radius of the star and planet , respectively ; and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are the reflection / emission , beaming , and ellipsoidal coefficients , respectively .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath27 encapsulates two distinct and different planet luminosity sources .",
    "one is due to the planet dayside geometric albedo resulting in reflected - light phase modulation , and the other is due to the planet day ",
    "night temperature contrast , resulting in thermal - emission phase modulation .",
    "while we expect both modulations to be proportional to @xmath30 , it is only a simplifying assumption to use for both the same phase function @xmath13 .    the reflection / emission phase function depends on the @xmath12 angle , defined as the star  planet  observer angle , which is related to the @xmath31 phase through @xmath32 where throughout this discussion we ignore constant terms that are not phase dependent , as these add up to the total flux and are not measurable from the data .",
    "a possible choice for the phase function is the geometric reflection function , which assumes that the received flux is proportional to the projected area on the sky plane of the illuminated half - sphere of the planet , as seen by the observer . following a notation similar to @xcite ,",
    "the geometric reflection phase function is @xmath33 under this definition of the phase function , the beer amplitudes ( equation  ( [ eq : effects ] ) ) are directly related to the fourier coefficients measured from the light curve ( equation  ( [ eq : fit ] ) ) through @xmath34    it is more common , however , to model the planet as a lambert sphere @xcite , which assumes that the planet surface is an ideal diffuse reflector , i.e. , of equal reflection to all directions in the half - sphere facing the star , regardless of the incident light direction .",
    "the resulting lambertian reflection phase function is @xmath35 where we have defined @xmath36 and @xmath37 with the same peak - to - peak amplitude .",
    "evaluating the fourier series expansion of @xmath37 , we realize that for all integers @xmath38 the @xmath39 coefficients equal zero , as this function is symmetric about the @xmath40 point . therefore , expanding with the cosine functions , we get @xmath41 ignoring all harmonics higher than @xmath42 provides accuracy better than @xmath43 , which gives , after translating from the @xmath12 angle to the @xmath31 angle , @xmath44 the resulting @xmath37 form shows that geometric reflection is simply a first harmonic approximation of lambertian reflection and that lambertian reflection has a cosine component in the _ second _ harmonic . next , from equations  ( [ eq : effects ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : lambapp ] ) we get @xmath45 which enables deriving the relations between the beer amplitudes and the measured fourier coefficients , resulting in @xmath46 we see that the apparent unnatural definition of the reflection term in equation  ( [ eq : effects ] ) actually leads to a simple form for the beer effect amplitudes , resulting in the same @xmath15 value for geometric and lambertian reflection , representing half the peak - to - peak variation of the reflection effect in both cases . on the other hand , as demonstrated by @xcite , the lambertian reflection assumption results in a larger ellipsoidal semiamplitude @xmath47 , relative to @xmath48 in the geometric case . in this paper",
    "we consider the two alternative ellipsoidal semiamplitudes using equations  ( [ eq : geo ] ) and ( [ eq : lamb ] ) .",
    "to model the superrotation - induced phase shift , we follow the model suggested by @xcite , while extending it to either geometric or lambertian phase functions . to account for superrotation in our analysis",
    ", we adopt a simplistic model for the total reflection / emission modulation that is the sum of a scattered - light phase function and a _ phase - shifted _ emission phase function . in this model",
    "we represent the total reflection / emission modulation in the _ kepler _ band as a phase - shifted lambertian or geometric phase function . while accurate for geometric scattered - light and emission phase functions , it is only an approximation for lambertian phase functions . under these model assumptions",
    ", we simply need to replace @xmath31 with @xmath49 in the geometric or lambertian phase function ( equation  ( [ eq : geodef ] ) or ( [ eq : lambapp ] ) ) , where @xmath50 is the phase shift in the _ kepler _ band due to superrotation , assumed to be positive . inserting",

    "the @xmath249 value at each temperature was derived by estimating the emission amplitude as blackbody emission in the _ kepler _ band from the dayside , assuming no heat redistribution , i.e. , a dark nightside .",
    "in this section we compare our results with those of previous phase modulation studies and discuss specific features of each system .",

    "@xcite analyzed the short - cadence q0q15 _ kepler _ light curve of hat - p-7 but report amplitudes that differ by @xmath264@xmath265 relative to the amplitudes we derive , a difference that may be a result of underestimated uncertainties .",

    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite used the short - cadence _ kepler _ light curve of tres-2 to derive its phase curve amplitudes , which are all within up to @xmath261 of the amplitudes we report here .",
    "we note , though , that our amplitude uncertainties , which are derived from the quarter - to - quarter variations , are @xmath268@xmath269 times larger than the uncertainties they report . for the planetary mass , @xcite report about @xmath270 difference between the mass derived from the ellipsoidal and the beaming amplitude , while @xcite report consistent planetary mass derived from the two effects .",
    "consistent with @xcite , our analysis for tres-2 shows no preference for a superrotation model , making our derived reflection / emission phase shift for this system consistent with zero .",

    "in addition , rv measurements , available for hat - p-7 , tres-2 , and kepler-76 @xcite , show spectroscopic rv amplitudes that are significantly smaller than the beaming - derived rv ones , pointing to inflated beaming amplitudes . in their discovery paper",
    ", @xcite suggested that the inconsistency of the kepler-76 beaming amplitude can be explained by a phase shift of the reflection / emission modulation due to the hot jupiter superrotation phenomenon predicted by @xcite and later observed by @xcite in the infrared .",
    "here we extend and test this model also for koi-13b , hat - p-7b , and tres-2b .      * a circular orbit ; * that planetary mass is negligible relative to the star mass ; * a first - order approximation for the ellipsoidal variation ; * a superrotation - induced phase - shifted lambertian or geometric reflection / emission phase function .    for kepler-76 and hat - p-7 @xmath191-tests",
    "show that the lambert superrotation beer model yields a better fit to the data and is highly preferred over the unshifted null model , while for koi-13 it is preferable only at the @xmath0 level . for tres-2",
    "we find no preference for the superrotation model .",
    "nevertheless , for all four systems the planet mass estimate derived from the lambert superrotation beer model is highly consistent with the planetary mass derived or constrained by rv studies , suggesting that the lambertian superrotation model yields a good photometric estimate for the planet mass , given a good stellar model .",
    "initially , the phase - shifted emission modulation was identified in the _ kepler _ band owing to its `` leakage '' into the @xmath279 coefficient , resulting in an apparently inflated beaming amplitude .",
    "it is interesting to check the dependence of this `` leakage '' phenomenon on the planetary parameters of the system . using the relations in table  [ table : amps ] ,",
    "the relative addition to the @xmath16 amplitude , due to phase - shifted emission , is @xmath280 while the right - hand side of the equation results from equation  ( [ eq : amps ] ) .",
    "considering that over the secondary - mass range of @xmath68@xmath281 , covering jupiters to late m dwarfs , the radius remains almost unchanged at about @xmath282 , the dependence above suggests that the relative inflation of the beaming amplitude is at maximum at the @xmath283 end of the range . adding to that the @xmath6 dependence",
    ", we conclude that close - in , hot jupiters are expected to show the most apparent inflated beaming amplitude .",
    "it is then not a surprise that this phenomenon was initially discovered in hot jupiters and is in agreement with the phase - shifted reflection / emission modulations of kepler-76 , hat - p-7 , and koi-13 reported by this study .",
    "detailed phase curve studies , such as the one we present here and alike ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , open the opportunity to estimate the mass and investigate the atmospheric properties of multiple close - in exoplanets , through analysis of the precise photometric light curve produced by space telescopes like corot and _ kepler_. such analyses of photometric light curves of future missions , like tess and plato , can not only discover nontransiting stellar binaries and exoplanets @xcite but also provide consistent planetary mass and density estimates of transiting exoplanets , and even identify close - in planets with unique , or nonordinary , phase - curve behavior , as targets for spectroscopic and ir follow - up .",
    "these phase - curve studies can serve as a highly efficient filter for focusing the research on transiting exoplanet systems with the most intriguing mass , radius , density , and phase curve features , so that future ir observations and transmission - spectroscopy resources are efficiently assigned to systems that are most valuable for our understanding of planetary atmospheres .",
