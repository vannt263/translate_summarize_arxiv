    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are an excellent tracer to probe the gravitational potential of their host galaxies .",
    "kinematics of the gc system in a galaxy is determined by the gravitational potential of their host galaxies and the gcs contain a fossil record of the dynamical evolution since the formation of their host galaxy . from the kinematic study of the gc system we can estimate the global mass distribution of their host galaxy including the dark matter , or can derive information on the orbital properties of the gcs if a mass distribution of their host galaxy is known in prior ( e.g. , x - ray observation of the hot gas ) .",
    "gcs are useful especially for the study of the outer region of a galaxy where the gravitational potential is mainly dominated by the dark matter .",
    "they are particularly efficient for the study of nearby giant elliptical galaxies ( ges ) where thousands of gcs are often found .",
    "recently @xcite presented a good summary of the results on the kinematics of the gc systems in six nearby ges , derived using the consistent analysis with the data in the literature : m49 @xcite , m60 @xcite , m87 @xcite , ngc 4636 @xcite , ngc 1399 @xcite , and ngc 5128 @xcite .",
    "later @xcite presented the results of a study of the kinematics of the gc system in another ge , ngc 1407 , in a nearby galaxy group and provided updated kinematic analysis of the gc systems in ges using their consistent method .",
    "one surprising finding from these studies is that the kinematics of the gc systems in these ges is diverse , showing a large difference in velocity dispersion , rotation , and their radial variation among the ges .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the photometric property of the gcs that is more or less similar among the ges @xcite .",
    "we have been carrying a project to investigate the spectroscopic properties of the gcs in nearby galaxies .",
    "our study on the kinematics of the gc system of m60 , a ge in virgo , was presented in @xcite and @xcite , and another on the m31 gc system was given in @xcite .",
    "recently we presented the measurement of radial velocities for the gcs in ngc 4636 in the companion paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , and we present a detailed kinematic analysis of these data in this paper .",
    "ngc 4636 is an e / s0 galaxy in virgo",
    ". it is located @xmath7 ( 2.8 mpc at the distance of ngc 4636 ) south east from the virgo center , and is considered to be a major member of a small group falling into the virgo center @xcite .",
    "ngc 4636 is relatively less luminous ( @xmath8 mag ) among the ges in virgo .",
    "it shows several interesting structures in the central region : jets in the radio images , arm - like structures , bubbles , and a cavity in the x - ray images @xcite , and dust emission in the far - infrared ( 100@xmath9 ) image @xcite .",
    "it is notable that the faint isophotes in the outer region of ngc 4636 are much flatter ( e4 ) than those in the inner region ( e0 ) , indicating that this galaxy may be in the transition to s0 @xcite .",
    "this fact may imply the presence of large - scale angular momentum associated with recent mergers .",
    "we adopted a distance to ngc 4636 , 14.7 mpc [ @xmath10 , as given by @xcite based on the surface brightness fluctuation method .",
    "one arcmin in the sky at this distance corresponds to @xmath11 kpc .",
    "effective radius , ellipticity , and position angle of ngc 4636 are @xmath12 kpc , @xmath13 , and pa@xmath14 deg , respectively @xcite .",
    "this paper is composed as follows .",
    "section [ data ] gives a brief description of the data used in this analysis , and the kinematic properties of the gc system in ngc 4636 are derived in  [ results ] . in ",
    "[ discuss ] , we compare kinematic properties of the ngc 4636 gc system to those of other ges , and discuss the implication of the results regarding the gc formation models .",
    "primary results are summarized in the final section .",
    "we used the spectroscopic data of the gcs given in paper i , which describes the details of the spectroscopic observation , data reduction , and the data set .",
    "here we only give a brief summary of the data set of ngc 4636 gcs .",
    "we selected gc candidates in deep , wide - field washington c and @xmath15 images ( @xmath16 ) obtained at kpno 4 m telescope @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations of these targets were made using the multi - object spectroscopy ( mos ) mode of faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas ) on the subaru 8.2 m telescope .",
    "we determined the radial velocities for 122 objects including 105 gcs , 11 foreground stars , 2 background galaxies , 3 probable intracluster gcs in virgo , and the nucleus of ngc 4636 , by cross - correlating the target spectra with five galactic gcs as templates .",
    "paper i presented a master catalog of the radial velocities for the gcs in ngc 4636 combining their data with the data for 174 gcs given by @xcite .",
    "the radial velocities of gcs in @xcite were transformed into our velocity system using equation ( 1 ) in paper i , and the transformed velocities were used for further analysis .    of the entire spectroscopic sample of gc candidates we selected 238 member gcs of ngc 4636 in paper i using radial velocities ( @xmath17 ) and ( @xmath18 ) colors ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "there are 108 blue gcs ( @xmath20 ) and 130 red gcs ( @xmath21 ) in the total sample . in figure",
    "[ fig - vmap ] , we show the spatial distribution of the objects in ngc 4636 with measured velocities .",
    "it shows that the spatial segregation of high - velocity gcs ( open symbols ) and low - velocity gcs ( filled symbols ) is not clearly seen , which indicates that the rotation of the gc system is , if any , weak ( to be discussed in  [ rotation ] ) .",
    "we have investigated the kinematic properties of the gc system using the master catalog of 238 gcs in ngc 4636 ( paper i ) : the rotation amplitude , the position angle of the rotation axis , the mean line - of - sight velocity , the projected velocity dispersion , and the velocity ellipsoid . @xcite and @xcite presented detailed analysis of the kinematics of the gc systems in m87 and m49 , respectively .",
    "we adopted the analysis method used by these studies for the following analysis , as done for the m60 gc system @xcite .",
    "first we derive the rotational property of the gc system in ngc 4636 .",
    "we made assumptions to derive the intrinsic rotational velocity field from the radial velocity data : ( a ) the gc system is spherically symmetric with an intrinsic angular velocity field stratified on spheres , and ( b ) that the gc rotation axis lies in the plane of the sky . with these assumptions",
    ", it is expected that radial velocities of gcs depend , if they follow any overall rotation , sinusoidally on the azimuthal angles . for the ngc 4636 gc system ,",
    "the assumption of spherical symmetry of the gc system is reasonable due to the modest projected ellipticity ( effective ellipticity , @xmath22 ) .",
    "thus we can determine the amplitude and axis of the rotation , fitting the observed line - of - sight velocities ( @xmath23 ) of the gcs with the function ,    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the projected position angle of a gc relative to the galaxy center measured from north to east , @xmath26 is the projected position angle of the rotation axis of the gc system , @xmath27 is the projected galactocentric distance , ( @xmath28 ) is the rotation amplitude , and @xmath29 is the systemic velocity of the gc system .",
    "figure [ fig - rotsub ] displays the radial velocities of gcs with measured uncertainties as a function of position angle for all 238 gcs ( _ top _ ) , 108 blue gcs ( _ middle _ ) , and 130 red gcs ( _ bottom _ ) .",
    "we overlaid the best fit rotation curve of equation ( [ eq - rot ] ) for each sample . for fitting the data we used an error - weighted , nonlinear fit of equation ( [ eq - rot ] ) with @xmath29 as a fixed value of the velocity of the ngc 4636 nucleus ( @xmath30 km s@xmath4 ) rather than as a free parameter for a better fitting .",
    "we estimated , using the biweight location of @xcite , the systemic velocity of the gc system to be @xmath31 km s@xmath4 ( see  [ dispersion ] ) , which agrees with the velocity of the ngc 4636 nucleus .",
    "the values of the rotation amplitudes ( @xmath28 ) we derived are @xmath32 km s@xmath4 for all the gcs , @xmath33 km s@xmath4 for the blue gcs , and @xmath34 km s@xmath4 for the red gcs .",
    "thus , all the gcs and the blue gcs show little rotation , while the red gcs show a marginal hint of rotation .",
    "our results are consistent with those based on a smaller sample of 174 gcs in @xcite who derived @xmath35 km s@xmath4 for all the gcs , @xmath36 km s@xmath4 for the blue gcs , and @xmath37 km s@xmath4 for the red gcs .",
    "the orientation of the rotation axis ( @xmath26 ) is estimated to be @xmath38 for all the gcs , @xmath39 for the blue gcs , and @xmath40 for the red gcs .",
    "the orientations of rotation axes for all subsamples appear to be similar , and they are closer to the photometric major axis , showing that the gcs rotate around the major axis ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "this result is in contrast with the result given by @xcite who derived @xmath42 for all the gcs , and @xmath43 for the red gcs , showing that the gcs rotate around the minor axis .",
    "if we use only the data given by @xcite , we get similar values to those given by @xcite .",
    "therefore , the difference in the orientation between the two studies is due to the difference in the sample .    in figure [ fig - rotreg ]",
    ", we present the rotation of the gc system for the samples of different radial bins in order to investigate any radial variation of rotational properties .",
    "we divided the gcs into two groups : the gcs in the inner region at @xmath44 and those in the outer region at @xmath45 .",
    "each of the sub regions includes a similar number of gcs ( 120 and 118 , respectively ) .",
    "we applied the same fitting procedure as used for the results in figure [ fig - rotsub ] for all the gcs , the blue gcs , and the red gcs in each radial bin .",
    "interestingly both the blue gcs and red gcs show some rotation around the major axis in the inner region ( @xmath46 km s@xmath4 , and @xmath47 km s@xmath4 , respectively ) , while both subsamples show little rotation in the outer region .",
    "the rotation of the red gcs seen for the entire radial range is found to be mainly due to the red gcs in the inner region .",
    "little rotation is seen for all the gcs even in the inner region , although both the blue gcs and red gcs show measurable rotation in the inner region .",
    "this is because the blue gcs and red gcs rotate in the opposite direction to each other , canceling the rotational effect for all the gcs .",
    "we summarize the kinematics of the ngc 4636 gc system derived in this study in table [ tab - n4636kin ] .",
    "several kinematic parameters for all the gcs , the blue gcs , and the red gcs are presented for the entire region , the inner region , and the outer region .",
    "the column ( 1 ) defines the range of the projected radial distance from the center of ngc 4636 for each region in arcsec , and the column ( 2 ) gives the mean value of the radial distance in arcsec .",
    "the number of gcs in each region is shown in the column ( 3 ) .",
    "the columns ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) represent the mean line - of - sight velocity ( the biweight location of @xcite ) and the velocity dispersion about this mean velocity ( the biweight scale of @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "the position angle of the rotation axis and the rotation amplitude estimated using equation ( [ eq - rot ] ) in each region are given in the columns ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , respectively .",
    "the column ( 8) gives the velocity dispersion about the best fit rotation curve ( @xmath48 ) . the column ( 9 ) gives the absolute value of the ratio of the rotation amplitude to the velocity dispersion about the best fit rotation curve .",
    "the uncertainties of these values represent @xmath49 @xmath50 confidence intervals that are determined from the numerical bootstrap procedure following the method of @xcite .    the velocity dispersion for all 238 gcs is estimated to be @xmath51 km s@xmath4 .",
    "this result is consistent , within the uncertainty , with the value given by @xcite who used 174 gcs , @xmath52 km s@xmath4 .",
    "in addition , it is found that the velocity dispersion about the mean velocity of the gc system for the blue gcs ( @xmath5 km s@xmath4 ) is 46 km s@xmath4   larger than that for the red gcs ( @xmath6 km s@xmath4 ) .",
    "we found a similar result for the velocity dispersion about the best fit rotation curve : @xmath53 km s@xmath4 for the blue gcs , and @xmath54 km s@xmath4 for the red gcs .",
    "our result for the red gcs is similar to the value given by @xcite , @xmath55 km s@xmath4 , within the uncertainty .",
    "however , our value for the blue gc is approximately 50 km s@xmath4 larger than that given by @xcite , @xmath56 km s@xmath4 .",
    "figure [ fig - vel ] displays the radial velocities of gcs with measured uncertainties against projected galactocentric distances .",
    "the mean radial velocities in four radial bins are overlaid by squares with long horizontal error bar .",
    "the velocity dispersion about the mean velocity in each bin is also represented by a vertical error bar .",
    "the mean velocities of all samples agree well with the systemic velocity of ngc 4636 .    to investigate the radial variation of velocity dispersion in detail , we present a smoothed radial profile of velocity dispersion about the mean radial velocity ( filled symbols ) and about the best fit rotation curve ( open symbols ) in figure  [ fig - disp ] . we calculate the velocity dispersion of the gcs lying within a radial bin with fixed width , @xmath57 kpc as increasing the bin center by a fixed step width , @xmath58 kpc .",
    "we set the radial width and the step width so that the number of gcs per bin exceeds 10 , and the calculation stops when the number of gcs in a bin is smaller than 10 .    the velocity dispersion for all the gcs varies more or less ( about 50 km s@xmath4 ) around the mean value for the range of radius .",
    "however , the velocity dispersion for the blue gcs shows an abrupt decrease from @xmath59 km s@xmath4 to @xmath60 km s@xmath4 at @xmath61 , and then keeps increasing with increasing radius to @xmath62 km s@xmath4 at @xmath63 . on the other hand ,",
    "the velocity dispersion for the red gcs stays almost constant at @xmath64 km s@xmath4 from the center out to @xmath65 , shows a slight decrease of @xmath66 km s@xmath4 for @xmath67 , and increases slightly at @xmath68 .",
    "the velocity dispersions about the best fit rotation curves of all three samples are not much different from those about the mean radial velocities ( also see table [ tab - n4636kin ] ) .      assuming that the ngc 4636 gc system is spherically symmetric",
    ", we can apply the jeans equation in the absence of rotation to the dynamical analysis of the gc system .",
    "the spherical jeans equation is represented by    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is a three dimensional radial distance from the galactic center , @xmath71 is a three dimensional density profile of the gc system , @xmath72 is a radial component of velocity dispersion , @xmath73 is a velocity anisotropy , @xmath74 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath75 is a total gravitating mass contained within a sphere of radius @xmath70 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath76 is a tangential component of velocity dispersion that is equal to an azimuthal component of the velocity dispersion , @xmath77 , in the absence of rotation of the gc system .",
    "there are two approaches to the dynamical analysis of the gc system : a ) to derive the mass profiles of the host galaxy for given orbits of the gcs , or b ) to determine the orbital properties of the gcs for a given mass profile of the host galaxy .",
    "several studies on the dynamics of the gc system have focused on determining the gravitational mass , @xmath75 , using the jeans equation by assuming a simple isotropic orbit with @xmath78 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    however , with an aid of an independent determination of the mass profile of an elliptical galaxy using x - ray data ( e.g. , @xcite for ngc 4636 ) , the velocity anisotropy itself can be investigated ( e.g. , @xcite ) . following the analysis of the m87 gc system by @xcite , the m49 gc system by @xcite , and the m60 gc system by @xcite , we first derive the three dimensional density profile of the gc system , @xmath71 and the total mass profile , @xmath75 . comparing the velocity dispersion profile ( vdp ) calculated from the jeans equation with the observed vdp , @xmath79",
    ", we determine the velocity anisotropy of the ngc 4636 gc system .      here",
    "we derive the three dimensional density profiles from the surface number density of ngc 4636 gcs for two models : the nfw profile @xcite and the dehnen profile @xcite .",
    "we used the surface number density profiles of ngc 4636 gcs given in @xcite .",
    "they derived the surface density profile of ngc 4636 gcs by combining the hst / wfpc2 archive data for the inner region at @xmath80 , and the kpno data for the outer region at @xmath81 .",

    "then they subtracted these background values from the original number counts to produce the radial profiles of the net surface number density of gcs .",

    "was used on the assumption that the gc luminosity function of ngc 4636 has a gaussian shape with a peak at @xmath88 mag and a dispersion @xmath89 mag @xcite .",

    "the fitting results for the combined ( c ) gcs , blue ( b ) gcs , and red ( r ) gcs are summarized as follows :    @xmath94    for the nfw profile , and @xmath95 for the dehnen profile .",
    "it is found that the scale length @xmath96 of the red gcs in the nfw profile is more than twice smaller than that of the blue gcs .",
    "this shows that the red gcs are more concentrated toward the galaxy center than the blue gcs .",
    "we investigate the existence of an extended dark matter halo comparing the velocity dispersion profile expected from the stellar mass profile with the measured profiles of stellar and gc velocity dispersions for ngc 4636 .",
    "we first derive the stellar mass profile from the surface brightness profile .",

    "( 3 ) massive galaxies grow becoming ges via dissipationless or dissipational merging of galaxies of various types and via accretion of many dwarf galaxies .",
    "new mrgcs will be formed during dissipational merging , but the faction of dissipational merging at this stage should be minor . a significant fraction of mpgcs in ges we see today are from dissipationless merging or accretion .",
    "observational evidence for this are : ( a ) the spatial distribution of the mpgcs is more extended than that of the mrgcs around ges @xcite ; ( b ) the intracluster gcs are mostly mpgcs @xcite ; ( c ) the kinematics of the gcs are diverse among the ges , and there are strong correlations of the gc kinematics with some global parameters of their host galaxies found in this study .",
    "it is also noted that @xcite concluded from the study of structure of a large sample of elliptical galaxies that bright boxy elliptical galaxies ( like ges ) were formed via dissipationless ( dry ) merger , while faint disky elliptical galaxies were formed via dissipational ( wet ) merger and conversion of late - type galaxies into spheroidals .    in this scenario",
    "each ge has a different history of growing involved with diverse merging and accretion , explaining naturally the diversity in the kinematics of the gc systems in ges .",
    "this scenario also explains the bimodal color distribution of the gcs , the difference in spatial distribution between the blue gcs and red gcs , the correlation in color between the red gcs and their host galaxies .",
    "this is a mixture model or a _ bibimbap _ model ( _ bibimbap _ is a korean dish where diverse vegetables and warm rice are mixed together with some tasty sauces ) in that it includes all the key elements in the previous models .",
    "using the photometric and spectroscopic database of 238 gcs ( 108 blue gcs and 130 red gcs ) in ngc 4636 ( ge in the virgo cluster ) , we have derived the kinematics of the gc system of this galaxy .",
    "then we have compared the kinematics of the gc systems in seven ges including ngc 4636 , and have investigated correlations between the gc kinematics and the globular parameters of their host galaxies .",
    "our primary results are summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "the red gc subsample of ngc 4636 shows marginal overall rotation . in the inner region both",
    "the blue and red gc subsamples show some rotation .",
    "2 .   both of the velocity dispersions about the mean velocity and about the best fit rotation curve of the blue gcs are about 50 km s@xmath4 larger than those of the red gcs .",
    "3 .   comparison of observed stellar and gc velocity dispersion profiles with those calculated from the stellar mass profile shows that the mass - to - light ratio is not constant , but should increase as the galactocentric distance increases , indicating the existence of an extended dark matter halo in ngc 4636 .",
    "4 .   using the x - ray mass profiles , the number density distribution of gcs , and the observed vdp of gcs",
    ", we have determined the velocity anisotropy of the ngc 4636 gc system .",
    "the orbits of the ngc 4636 gc system are tangentially biased .",
    "the orbits of both the red gcs and blue gcs at @xmath152 kpc are tangential , and the orbits of the red gcs is slightly more tangential than that of the blue gcs .",
    "the orbit of the blue gcs in the inner region at @xmath154 kpc is found to be radial .",
    "5 .   from the comparison of the kinematics of the ngc 4636 gc system in this study with those for other ges",
    ", we found several correlations between the kinematic properties of the gc systems and the global parameters of their host galaxies .",
    "we compared the observational results for the gc systems in ges including ngc 4636 with those in several gc formation models , and found that some results are consistent with the predictions from the models but some are not .",
    "we suggested a mixture scenario for the origin of the gcs in ges .",

    "<S> , we have investigated the kinematics of the gc system . </S>",
    "<S> the ngc 4636 gc system shows weak overall rotation , which is dominated by the red gcs . </S>",

    "<S> the velocity dispersions for the blue gcs about the mean velocity and about the best fit rotation curve have a significant variation depending on the galactocentric radius . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of observed stellar and gc velocity dispersion profiles with the velocity dispersion profiles calculated from the stellar mass profile shows that the mass - to - light ratio should increase as the galactocentric distance increases , indicating the existence of an extended dark matter halo . from the comparison of the observed gc velocity dispersion profiles and the velocity dispersion profiles calculated for the x - ray mass profiles in the literature , we find that the orbit of the gc system is tangential , and that the orbit of the red gcs is slightly more tangential than that of the blue gcs . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the gc kinematics of ngc 4636 with those of other six ges , finding that the kinematic properties of the gcs are diverse among ges . </S>",
    "<S> we find several correlations between the kinematics of the gcs and the global parameters of their host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implication of the results for the formation models of the gc system in ges , and suggest a mixture scenario for the origin of the gcs in ges . </S>"
