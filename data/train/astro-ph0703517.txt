    "dust grains absorb stellar ultraviolet ( uv)optical light and reprocess it into far - infrared ( fir ) , thereby affecting the energetics of interstellar medium ( ism ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the fir luminosity is known to be a good indicator of star formation rate ( sfr ) in galaxies @xcite .",
    "this can be explained if a large part of dust grains are heated by uv light from massive stars .",
    "the fir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of dust grains reflects various information on the grains themselves and on the sources of grain heating ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "dust temperature , which can be estimated from wavelength at the peak of fir sed , is determined by the intensity of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) and the optical properties of dust ( i.e.  how it absorbs and emits light ) .",
    "since dust grains absorb uv light efficiently , the fir luminosity and the dust temperature mostly reflect the uv radiation field @xcite .    the fir sed of the galaxy ( milky way )  the `` nearest '' galaxy  has been investigated by various authors .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite explain the galactic fir sed as well as the extinction curve .",
    "@xcite provide a unified explanation for the galactic polarization and extinction curve by adopting grains composed of silicate cores and organic refractory mantles , small carbonaceous particles , and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) .",
    "although there are some variations for assumed species , three grain components are usually assumed : silicate , graphite and pahs . besides the grain composition and the isrf , the size distribution also affects the fir sed .",
    "the temperature of silicate and graphite grains stays at an equilibrium temperature determined by the radiative equilibrium if the size is roughly larger than 0.01 @xmath6 m @xcite .",
    "such large grains are called large grains ( lgs ) .",
    "since the equilibrium temperature is usually @xmath730 k in galactic environments , the emission peak lies around wavelengths of @xmath8@xmath9 m . if grains are smaller , they are transiently ( stochastically ) heated to a large temperature and emit photons with wavelengths shorter than @xmath10 m @xcite .",
    "those grains are called very small grains ( vsgs ) . the other component ,",
    "pah , only contributes to wavelengths shorter than @xmath11 m .",
    "since we are interested in wavelengths longer than @xmath12 @xmath6 m , we do not treat pahs in this paper .",
    "so far , a major part of works have focused on fir emission from high galactic - latitude cirrus or from some limited regions in the galactic plane ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because of the complication in the galactic plane , which has large inhomogeneity with a variety of isrf intensity and with a large range of gas ( dust ) density , etc . , one may expect that a unified understanding of fir sed in the galactic plane is impossible . however , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter h06 ) show that the fir colour - colour relation ( 60100 @xmath6 m vs.  140100 @xmath6 m ) defined by data points with galactic latitudes of @xmath13 has a clear sequence .",
    "a large fraction ( @xmath1495% ) of the data points are on a colour - colour relation which they call `` main correlation '' . a minor part ( @xmath1510% ) of points",
    "belong to another sequence called `` sub - correlation '' ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the sub - correlation tends to be found in regions with large radio intensity , which indicates a strong isrf .",
    "the `` main correlation '' of the galactic plane is also consistent with the fir colours of a sample of nearby galaxies compiled by @xcite ( see fig .  8 of h06 ) .",
    "in particular , the fir colour - colour relation ( 60100 @xmath6 m vs.  140100 @xmath6 m ) of the magellanic clouds is located at the extension of the main correlation of the galactic plane . as stated by h06",
    ", this implies that the optical properties of grains in fir are common among the galaxy and the magellanic clouds .",
    "h06 also show that the fir colours predicted by @xcite based on `` standard '' grain optical properties @xcite can not reproduce the main correlation .    indeed",
    ", some observational and experimental results show that the fir grain properties may be different from the `` standard '' ones . based on the data of the far - infrared absolute spectrophotometer ( firas ) aboard the _ cosmic background explorer _",
    "( _ cobe _ ) , @xcite suggest that the galactic dust has more enhanced emissivity at @xmath16 m than expected before .",
    "some isophot observations have also reached a similar conclusion @xcite , although those observation target dense regions , where the dust properties may be modified by grain coagulation to form fluffy aggregates and/or by coating of ice mantles .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown that the extinction at @xmath17 band derived from the fir dust emission is higher than that derived from the optical digitized sky survey data , suggesting a previous underestimation of dust emissivity at fir wavelengths .",
    "an enhanced fir emissivity is also derived for extragalactic objects @xcite .",
    "@xcite find experimentally that some kinds of amorphous silicate show emissivities larger than those found in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the wavelength dependence suggested by those authors is different from that presented by @xcite . therefore , it is worth reexamining the fir emissivity of dust by using the new observational results provided by h06 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to further investigate the origin of the main correlation both observationally and theoretically .",
    "since the same main correlation is defined for the magellanic clouds , we also treat the fir emission in these galaxies .",
    "furthermore , we extend the analysis of h06 to high - galactic - latitude regions to examine if the universality of the main correlation found in the galactic plane holds over the entire galaxy . since the isrf in high galactic latitudes",
    "is considered to be more uniform than in the galactic plane , the dependence on the galactic latitude provides us with a key to understand the effect of inhomogeneous isrf . a theoretical framework for the fir",
    "sed developed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter dl01 ) is adopted for theoretical analysis of the main correlation .",
    "the sub - correlation is also investigated .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in section [ sec : model ] , we describe the models adopted to calculate the fir sed .",
    "then , in section [ sec : data ] , we briefly review the observational results by h06 , presenting also some additional analyses . in section [ sec : results ] , the fir colour - colour relation predicted by our models is compared with the observational main correlation . here , the sub - correlation is also discussed .",
    "section [ sec : sum ] is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "we adopt the theoretical framework of dl01 to calculate the sed of dust emission .",
    "since we are interested in a wavelength range of @xmath18140 @xmath6 m , we neglect pahs , which contribute to the emission at @xmath19 m ( @xcite ; dl01 ) .",
    "our assumptions on the relevant quantities are described below .",
    "we assume a grain to be spherical with a radius of @xmath34 .",
    "the absorption cross section of the grain is expressed as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is called absorption efficiency .",
    "the optical constants of silicate and graphite grains are taken from @xcite . for the uv regime , we adopt `` smoothed astronomical silicate '' from @xcite for silicate grains . for graphite grains ,",
    "two - thirds of the particles have an dielectric function @xmath37 and one - third @xmath38 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the number density of grains with sizes between @xmath34 and @xmath39 is denoted as @xmath40 , where the subscript @xmath41 denotes a grain species ( @xmath42 stands for silicate and graphite , respectively ) .",
    "we assume a power - law form for @xmath43 : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the upper and lower cutoffs of grain size , respectively , and @xmath47 is the normalizing constant .",
    "@xcite find that the extinction curve observed in the solar neighborhood is reproduced by a composite model of graphite and silicate grains with @xmath48 .",
    "we assume @xmath49   and @xmath50 m for both graphites and silicates @xcite , although @xcite adopt more elaborate functional form .",
    "we have confirmed that the difference does not affect the following discussion on the fir colours .",
    "the mixing ratio between silicate and graphite is uncertain and different even among models for the galactic dust @xcite .",
    "according to @xcite , the ratio between those two species is different among the galaxy , the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) . in the smc ,",
    "@xcite suggest a silicate - dominated dust composition , while @xcite argue against such a composition from a study of the depletion pattern ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "considering such large uncertainty in the grain composition , we present the fir sed of each grain species separately to avoid the uncertainty in the mixing ratio between the species .",
    "the effects of mixing two species are briefly mentioned in section [ subsec : mixing ] .    as long as we treat the fir colours of a single species ( section [ subsec : colour ] ) , the constant @xmath47 cancels out .",
    "thus , it is not necessary to determine the absolute abundance of graphite and silicate . the relative ratio of @xmath47 between species is important only when we consider a mixture of various species ( section [ subsec : mixing ] ) . in this case , @xmath47 is determined by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the mass density of species @xmath41 in the ism , and @xmath53 is the material density of species @xmath41 .",
    "we assume @xmath54 g @xmath55 and @xmath56 g @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "in fact , we require only the ratio @xmath57 ( or @xmath58 ) to calculate the fir colors in a mixture of the two species .",
    "we adopt multi - dimensional debye models for the heat capacity of grains .",
    "the heat capacity of a graphite grain per unit volume is ( dl01 ; @xcite ) @xmath59\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath60 where @xmath61 @xmath55 @xcite is the number of carbon atoms contained in the unit volume of the grain , @xmath62 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath63 is the grain temperature .",

    "the total fir intensity ( per frequency per hydrogen nucleus per solid angle ) of dust emission at a wavelength @xmath21 can be estimated as @xmath66 where @xmath41 specifies the grain species and @xmath67 is the temperature distribution function of the grains .",
    "we assume that the fir radiation is optically thin .",
    "thus , the observed colour directly reflects the ratio of the above intensity . here the colour at wavelengths of @xmath68 and @xmath69 is defined as @xmath70 , which is called @xmath71 colour .",
    "the distribution function @xmath67 is calculated by the formalism of dl01 ( see their section 4 ) based on the quantities in sections [ subsec : isrf][subsec : cap ] .",
    "the enthalpy of a grain is divided into discrete bins , and the transition probability between the bins is treated by taking into account the heating by interstellar radiation and the cooling by emission ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the data analyzed by h06 are adopted in this paper .",
    "h06 used the zodi - subtracted mission average ( zsma ) taken by the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) of the _ cobe_. they analyzed the data at three fir wavelengths : @xmath72 m , 100 @xmath6 m , and 140 @xmath6 m .",
    "then , they examined the relation between two colours , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "following h06 , we adopt the intensity after colour correction for the 100-@xmath6 m and 140-@xmath6 m bands . for the galactic plane , they treated regions with galactic latitudes of @xmath75 .",
    "the fir data of the magellanic clouds are also analyzed . in order to avoid the uncertainty in the subtraction of the zodiacal component",
    ", they only select the region with @xmath76 mjy sr@xmath23 .",
    "the error of @xmath77 is less than 10% .    in figure",
    "[ fig : hibi_fig2]a , we show the distribution of the galactic - plane data in the colour - colour diagram .",
    "h06 found strong correlations between the two colours .",
    "more than 90% of the data lie on a strong correlation called main correlation , which can be fitted as ( h06 ) @xmath78 the main correlation also explains the fir colours of the lmc and the smc ( h06b ) .",
    "there is another correlation sequence , called sub - correlation in h06 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath79         h06 also examined the dependence on the galactic longitude @xmath80 , showing that the fir colours tend to shift downwards along the main correlation as @xmath80 increases from 0@xmath81 to 180@xmath81 . since the isrf in the region toward the galactic centre tends to be higher than that in the opposite direction @xcite , the colour shift along the main correlation can be caused by the difference in isrf ; that is , the fir colours of dust grains irradiated by a high isrf tends to be situated in an upper part of the main correlation on the colour - colour diagram .",
    "we extend our analysis to high galactic latitudes ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "the procedure of the data analysis and the selection criterion for the intensity ( i.e.@xmath76 mjy sr@xmath23 ) are the same as h06 .",
    "most of the data are taken from @xmath83 , since the criterion for the intensity is hard to be satisfied in higher galactic latitudes . in figure",
    "[ fig : hibi_fig2]b , we show the results .",
    "although the data distribution is shifted slightly downward compared with the galactic plane data , we clearly see the main correlation .",
    "moreover , the sub - correlation is not clear in the high galactic latitudes .",
    "this supports the idea of h06 that the sub - correlation is produced by the contamination of high - isrf regions , which tend to reside in the galactic plane .",
    "the data presented in figure [ fig : hibi_fig2 ] indicate that the main correlation is robust against the change of galactic latitudes ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "h06 also show that the fir colours shifts along the main correlation by the variation of galactic longitudes ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "these facts mean that the main correlation is independent of the complexity of the galactic structure .",
    "since the inhomogeneity of isrf should be smaller in high galactic latitudes than in the galactic plane , the robustness of the main correlation over a variety of @xmath84 suggests that a detailed modeling of galactic structures and of inhomogeneous isrf are not necessary to understand the main correlation .    as mentioned in the previous subsection",
    ", h06 argued that the main correlation is produced by a sequence of varying isrf : the fir colours tend to be located in an upper part of the main correlation for a high isrf .",
    "however , this was only suggested from the longitude dependence but was not theoretically demonstrated .",
    "thus , in section [ sec : results ] , we investigate how the fir colour - colour relation changes for various isrf intensities . by examining",
    "if the observed colour - colour relation is explained or not , we will finally be able to test what kind of grain species is consistent with the observational fir colour - colour relation ( section [ subsec : fir_opt ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the main correlation can also explain the fir colours in the magellanic clouds .",
    "since the lmc has a face - on geometry , the inhomogeneity in the isrf in a line of sight may be small .",
    "the fact that the fir colour - colour relation of the lmc shifts upward relative to that of the galaxy suggests that the location in the main correlation reflects the strength of isrf , since the lmc is generally believed to have a higher isrf than the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is surprising that the fir colours of the lmc and the smc are located on the main correlation defined by the galactic dust grains , and it is interesting to give a unified understanding of the fir colours for those three galaxies .",
    "we also tackle this problem in sections [ sec : results ] and [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "h06 show that the sub - correlation can be reproduced by summing two colours in the main correlation .",
    "thus , they argue that the main correlation is fundamental .",
    "we also follow their argument and concentrate on explaining the main correlation .",
    "the sub - correlation is investigated in section [ subsec : mixture ] .",
    "from various observational evidence such as extinction curves and interstellar depletion patterns , dust is believed to be mainly composed of two species : silicate and carbonaceous dust @xcite .",
    "for those two species , @xcite proposed astronomical silicate and graphite , which reproduce the observational extinction curve and fir emission spectrum ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "based on the models described in section [ sec : model ] , we examine how the fir colours change by the variation of isrf ( @xmath32 ) . following h06 , we focus on the relation between the 60 @xmath6m100 @xmath6 m colour [ @xmath73 ] and the 140 @xmath6m100 @xmath6 m colour [ @xmath74 ] . in figures [ fig : clr_std ] , we plot the colour - colour relations of graphite and astronomical silicate for @xmath87 , 1 , 3 , 10 , and 30 .",
    "the discrepancy between the observational main correlation and the theoretical prediction is significant .",
    "some mechanism that shifts the colour - colour relation upward and/or rightward should be included to explain the observational colour correlations .",
    "vs.@xmath88 ) relation for silicate and graphite grains ( large crosses and large squares , respectively ) .",
    "the different points correspond to @xmath87 , 1 , 3 , 10 , and 30 from low to high @xmath88 colours .",
    "the same contour as shown in figure [ fig : hibi_fig2]a as well as the main and sub - correlations ( dashed and dotted lines , respectively ) are also presented .",
    "[ fig : clr_std],width=302 ]    it should be noticed that both silicate and graphite grains trace similar tracks on the fir colour - colour relation although the uv absorption coefficients and heat capacities are different between those two species .",
    "this strongly suggests that the track on the fir colour - colour diagram is determined mainly by the fir absorption coefficients of grains .",
    "indeed , both have dependence roughly described as @xmath89 .",
    "thus , we suspect that the fir colour - colour relation is not sensitive to various factors other than the wavelength dependence of the fir absorption coefficient .    the colour - colour relation shifts upwards if the contribution from vsgs relative to that of lgs increases , since the emission from stochastically heated vsgs contributes significant to the emission at @xmath72 m .",
    "indeed , grains with @xmath90   contribute to the 60 @xmath6 m intensity @xcite .",
    "a change of the isrf spectrum and/or of the grain size distribution can change the relative contribution from the stochastic vsg emission .",
    "first we vary the isrf spectrum .",
    "a hard spectrum could relatively enhance the emission from vsgs , since the cross section of a vsg is sensitive to the change of wavelength in the uv regime ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we calculate the fir colours by assuming a `` hard '' spectrum without the optical  nir bump ; i.e.we adopt @xmath91 for @xmath92 instead of the expression in equation ( [ eq : isrf ] ) .",
    "the fir colour - colour relation calculated with this hard spectrum is shown in figure [ fig : clr_enhanced60]a .",
    "the colour - colour relation shifts upward and approaches the main correlation compared with the relation in figure [ fig : clr_std ] .",
    "this is due to relative enhancement of the stochastic heating of vsgs , which contributes to the 60 @xmath6 m emission .",
    "however , the change of the fir colours for various @xmath32 does not follow the main correlation .",
    "moreover , such a hard spectrum as assumed here is unrealistic for high galactic latitude , where the main correlation is also seen .",
    "thus , we conclude that the change of the uv spectrum can not explain the observational fir colours .        the enhancement of the stochastic heating occurs also if the relative number of vsgs increases .",
    "thus , we expect that the colour - colour relation shifts upward if we assume a grain size distribution with an enhanced number of vsgs . the number of vsgs may be increased by shattering @xcite .",
    "the size distribution shown by @xcite can be roughly fitted by @xmath93 ( i.e.  @xmath94 in equation [ eq : size_dist ] ) .",
    "we also examine @xmath95 as an intermediate case . in both cases ,",
    "we adopt the same values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 as assumed in section [ subsec : size ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : clr_enhanced60]b , we show the colour - colour relation for @xmath95 and 4.0 .",
    "we observe that the 60 @xmath6m100 @xmath6 m colour is sensitive to the grain size distribution .",
    "however , the overall trend of the main correlation is not reproduced neither by @xmath95 nor by @xmath94 .",
    "the 60 @xmath6m100 @xmath6 m colour is clearly out of the observed range for @xmath94 .",
    "although @xmath95 explains the most concentrated part of the data with @xmath961 , the trend along the main correlation is not reproduced .    the upper and lower cutoffs of grain size ( @xmath46 and @xmath45 ) can also be changed . however , the 140 @xmath6m100 @xmath6 m colour is not sensitive to the change of @xmath45 because it is determined by the equilibrium temperature of large grains .",
    "it is not largely affected by the change of @xmath46 as long as @xmath97 m .",
    "the 60 @xmath6m100 @xmath6 m colour monotonically increases if the fraction of vsgs increases . according to @xcite , grains with @xmath90 ",
    "contribute to the 60 @xmath6 m flux , while a large fraction of the 100 @xmath6 m flux comes from grains with @xmath98  .",
    "thus , as @xmath45 decreases and/or @xmath46 decreases , the 60 @xmath6m100 @xmath6 m colour monotonically increases . however , this colour is not sensitive to the grain size distribution at @xmath99  , and the abundance of such very small particles is constrained better in mid - infrared ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have confirmed after calculations with our models that resulting colour - colour relations predicted by decreased @xmath45 and/or @xmath46 are similar to those in figure [ fig : clr_enhanced60 ] and that the observed main correlation can never be explained by changes of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    in summary , it is difficult to explain the overall main correlation by simply enhancing the stochastic heating component , which contributes to the 60 @xmath6 m intensity .",
    "heat capacities and grain optical constants are also concerned with the fir sed .",
    "however , as shown in appendix [ app : mat ] , difference in the heat capacity does not change the fir colour - colour relation .",
    "there , we also show that different materials with different uv  near - infrared absorption coefficients does not explain the observational fir colour - colour relation .",
    "we note that all the materials examined in appendix [ app : mat ] have the fir spectral index ( which is defined as @xmath100 , i.e.  @xmath101 is approximated to be proportional to @xmath102 ) nearly equal to 2 .",
    "we are left with changing the fir optical properties of grains .",
    "the following subsection is devoted to examining the possibility that the fir spectral index is different from 2 .",
    "a spectral index @xmath103 is the most frequently used value , which is supported by some experiments and observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , an analysis of the firas data by @xcite indicates that the galactic dust has @xmath104 .",
    "some other observational and experimental results also indicate that the fir emissivity index may be smaller than 2 @xcite . ) , but even if the colour is corrected by assuming @xmath105 , the difference in the colours is less than 10% .",
    "thus , the prediction with @xmath106 can be compared with the results of h06 within an uncertainty of @xmath107% . ]",
    "the range of @xmath108 is roughly from @xmath109 to 1.6 as suggested for the fir colours of the galaxy and the magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "some species indeed show such a low emissivity index @xcite : @xmath110 for @xmath111 ( amorphous ) .",
    "since there is no available information on the optical constants of @xmath111 in the wavelengths shorter than fir , we can not include this species consistently into our models .",
    "fortunately , the resulting fir colours are not sensitive to the detailed wavelength dependence of the uv absorption coefficient as shown in appendix [ app : mat ] .",
    "thus , we adopt the emissivity of astronomical silicate or graphite at @xmath112 m and change the spectral index at @xmath113 m .",
    "that is , we choose the following absorption efficiency for @xmath114 : @xmath115 where we adopt the value @xmath116 from @xcite for astronomical silicate and graphite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : clr_beta ] , we show the colour - colour relation for various fir spectral indexes . here",
    "we call the species according to the adopted optical properties at @xmath117 although we modify artificially @xmath101 at @xmath114 .",
    "we observe from figure [ fig : clr_beta ] that @xmath106 is roughly consistent with the main correlation if the isrf intensity is between @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( @xmath120 may also be permitted considering the uncertainty in the data ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the colour - colour relation is just along the main correlation .",
    "moreover , the region of the largest concentration of the data ( see the contours in fig .",
    "[ fig : clr_beta ] ) is reproduced with a standard isrf @xmath121 .",
    "thus , we conclude that a fir emissivity index of @xmath1181.5 is successful in reproducing the main correlation .             for the absorption efficiency at @xmath113 m",
    ", we also examine a hybrid functional form proposed by @xcite : @xmath122^{1/6}}\\ , , \\label{eq : reach}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which behaves like equation ( [ eq : beta ] ) with @xmath106 for @xmath123 and @xmath103 at @xmath124 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we assume that @xmath125 m , following @xcite . for @xmath112 m",
    ", we adopt the same absorption efficiency of astronomical silicate and graphite as used in section [ subsec : std ] .",
    "thus , we set the value of @xmath126 so that the continuity of @xmath101 at @xmath127 m is satisfied . in figure",
    "[ fig : clr_reach ] , we show the colour - colour relation for this absorption efficiency .",
    "the resulting relation is similar to that in figure [ fig : clr_beta ] with @xmath106 .",
    "thus , the 60 @xmath6m100 @xmath6 m vs.140 @xmath6m100 @xmath6 m colour - colour relation is determined by the spectral index around @xmath128m140 @xmath6 m and is not sensitive to the details of the absorption coefficient at the other wavelengths .      in reality , both silicate and graphite contribute to the fir sed at the same time .",
    "thus , it is worth examining the fir colour - colour relation predicted by mixtures of those two species .",
    "as stated in section [ subsec : size ] , there is a large uncertainty in the mixing ratio among models .",
    "thus , we examine a variety of mixing ratios . in figure",
    "[ fig : clr_beta]c , we show the fir colour - colour relation calculated by a graphite - silicate mixture .",
    "first , the mass ratio of those two species is assumed to be @xmath129 according to @xcite . with this ratio",
    ", graphite dominates the fir sed and the fir colour - colour relation becomes almost the same as that of graphite ( see figure [ fig : clr_beta]b ) .",
    "a similar graphite - dominated fir sed can be seen in @xcite .",
    "as the fraction of silicate becomes larger , the fir colour - colour relation approaches that shown in figure [ fig : clr_beta]a . in order to show this",
    ", we also examine a silicate - dominated composition as proposed for the lmc .",
    "we adopt a mass ratio of @xmath130 .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : clr_beta]d , which becomes relatively similar to the silicate colours shown in figure [ fig : clr_beta]a .",
    "however , it is evident that the colours of the mixed population are between those of single species .",
    "we have found in the previous section that the fir colours are sensitive to the fir absorption coefficient of dust grains and are robust to the absorption coefficient in wavelengths other than the fir .",
    "then we have suggested that the fir emissivity index of @xmath3 fits the main correlation .",
    "an emissivity index of @xmath131 can also explain the submillimetre part of the galactic fir sed without introducing a very cold component @xcite.m intensity is larger than 3 mjy sr@xmath23 , the contamination of such a background is negligible . ] indeed it would be possible to explain the fir colour by mixing two components with different dust temperatures , but the robustness of the main correlation against the galactic latitudes would strongly require that the mixing ratio between those two components be uniform over the entire galaxy .",
    "more natural interpretation is obviously that the main correlation reflects the fir absorption coefficient of dust grains itself .",

    "however , it is also important to stress that the discussion on the amount of very cold dust strongly depends on the assumed fir  sub - mm spectral index .",

    "the main correlation is also consistent with the fir colours of nearby galaxies .",
