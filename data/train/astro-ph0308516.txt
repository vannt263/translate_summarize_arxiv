    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are binary stars in which a white dwarf accretes matter from a close companion , which usually resembles a lower - main - sequence star .",
    "the dwarf novae are a subclass of cvs which show distinctive outbursts , thought to result from an instability in an accretion disk about the white dwarf .",
    "the am herculis stars ( sometimes called `` polars '' ) are another type of cv , in which the accreted material is entrained in a strong magnetic field anchored in the white dwarf , forming an accretion funnel above the magnetic poles .",
    "@xcite has written an excellent monograph on cvs .",
    "distances for various types of cvs are fundamentally important to physical models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but they have not been easy to obtain @xcite . historically , none were near enough for trigonometric parallax . @xcite published parallaxes for some of the brightest dwarf novae , but these have proven to be incorrect @xcite .",
    "the _ hipparcos _ satellite obtained useful parallaxes only for a handful of the apparently brightest cvs @xcite . @xcite",
    "used statistical parallaxes ( proper motions and radial velocities ) to determine rough absolute magnitudes for dwarf novae at minimum light . when the secondary star is visible in the spectrum ( which it often is nt ) , and the orbital period @xmath1 , is known , it is possible to estimate a distance spectroscopically , by combining the surface brightness vs. @xmath2 relation with constraints on the secondary s radius from the roche geometry .",
    "@xcite employed a variant on this method which used @xmath3-band photometry . because @xmath3-band surface brightness depends weakly on spectral type , and at a known @xmath1 the roche tightly lobe constrains the secondary s radius ,",
    "the apparent @xmath3 magnitude can be used to set a lower limit on a cv s distance under the assumption that _ all _ the @xmath3-band light arises from the secondary . @xcite , among others , employed this technique . but a lower limit is not a distance , and the complex nature of the disk s emission makes the method problematic in many cases @xcite . finally , for a small number of systems distances have been derived from spectra of the exposed white dwarf during intervals of low accretion ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "only recently have a few accurate parallaxes of cvs become available from the fine guidance sensor ( fgs ) on hst .",
    "@xcite , in a breakthrough paper , reported the first accurate distances for the bright dwarf novae ss cyg , u gem , and ss aur , and from these found that the secondaries of these dwarf novae are somewhat too luminous for the main sequence @xcite .",
    "fgs parallaxes are also available for the novalike variables rw tri @xcite and tv col @xcite . and just as the present paper was being completed , t. harrison kindly communicated a draft of @xcite , with precise parallaxes for wz sge and yz cnc , two of the objects studied here .",
    "meanwhile , the precision of ground based parallaxes has advanced dramatically thanks to the advent of ccd detectors .",
    "@xcite described early ccd parallax work and showed that very high precision was possible ; @xcite ( hereafter usno92 ) gave detailed descriptions of their procedures and accurate parallaxes for dozens of stars , mostly from the luyten half - second ( lhs ) list .",
    "many of the parallaxes in usno92 have formal uncertainties less than 1 mas (= @xmath4 arcsec ) , which is not much worse than hst parallaxes . @xcite",
    "give more recent results from the usno program and discuss further refinements of their technique .",
    "only a handful of active ccd parallax programs exist , so the present project was partly motivated by curiosity as to how accurately a non - specialist could measure parallaxes using a general - purpose telescope .    while hst parallaxes have unsurpassed precision , hst observing time is limited and relatively few objects can be observed .",
    "i therefore attempted ground - based ccd parallax determinations of a sample of cataclysmic variable stars .",
    "the sample is not meant to be complete or representative , but was selected informally on the basis of brightness , perceived likelihood of a positive result , astrophysical interest , and observational constraints .",
    "this paper describes this program as follows . because this is a new program ,",
    "sections 2 and 3 describe the observations and analysis procedures in detail .",
    "section 4 discusses the bayesian method used to estimate distances from the parallaxes , proper motions , and magnitudes .",
    "section 5 presents the results for the individual cvs .",
    "a brief discussion follows in section 6 , and section 7 offers conclusions .",
    "all the observations are from the _",
    "f_7.5 focus of the hiltner 2.4 m telescope at mdm observatory on kitt peak , arizona . a thinned site 2048@xmath5 ccd yielded a scale of @xmath6 per 24 @xmath7 m pixel .",
    "the 50 mm square filter vignetted the field of view , so the images recorded were @xmath8 .",
    "the same detector was used throughout the program .",
    "table 1 lists the targets and gives a journal of the observations . because the telescope is ` classically ' scheduled in observing runs ,",
    "the observations come in short runs of a few days separated by months or years .",
    "thus even the best - observed targets have observations at only a modest number of independent epochs .",
    "it was not practical to schedule runs to maximize the parallax displacements of individual objects .",
    "usno92 explain _ differential color refraction _",
    "when different spectral energy distributions are convolved with a finite passband , different effective wavelengths result , which suffer different amounts of refraction because of atmospheric dispersion .",
    "this effect was severe for usno92 because they used a wide passband .",
    "to minimize dcr , i chose a filter approximating kron - cousins @xmath9 , which is narrower than the usno92 filter and farther to the red , where atmospheric dispersion is reduced .",
    "all the parallax observations were taken with this filter .",
    "most exposures were taken within @xmath10 hr of the meridian , in order to further minimize dcr effects and other problems which might arise from telescope flexure and such . because the dcr effects were much less severe than for the usno , some exposures from larger hour angles were included .",
    "on the first run , the ccd was inadvertently aligned with its columns about 2.4 degrees from true north .",
    "this ( mis)alignment was maintained throughout the program , with the exception of 1999 june , when the alignment was not set correctly .",
    "there was no obvious problem with the 1999 june data , so this step may not have been necessary .",
    "when each target was first observed , it was centered approximately on the ccd and its pixel coordinates noted .",
    "for all subsequent observations , the pointing was reproduced within roughly 20 pixels in order to minimize the effects of any optical distortion and to allow use of a consistent set of reference stars .    in order to avoid saturating the reference or ( sometimes ) program star images , exposures were generally kept to @xmath11 s , reaching 25 s in some cases .",
    "reading and preparing the ccd took more than two minutes , so efficiency suffered .",
    "many ( typically @xmath12 ) exposures were taken at each pointing . from time to time",
    "the telescope was ` dithered ' by a few pixels between exposures in a sequence .    as one might expect , the seeing strongly affected the results .",
    "pictures taken in poor seeing had large fit residuals .",
    "for this reason , few data are included from images with seeing worse than 1.5 arcsec fwhm , and the majority of the data are from images with @xmath13 1 arcsec seeing .",
    "the very best images included are around @xmath14 arcsec , still not quite undersampled .",
    "when the sky was suitably cloudless , exposures in the @xmath15 filters ( or sometimes only @xmath16 and @xmath9 ) were added to the program , together with standard star fields from @xcite to allow transformation to standard magnitudes .",
    "photometric exposures were obtained on at least two nights , and the results were averaged after analysis .",
    "the consistency was generally better than 0.05 mag .",
    "the data were reduced using standard iraf routines for bias subtraction and flat field correction .",
    "the flat fields were constructed from offset , medianed images of the twilight sky .",
    "star centers were measured with the iraf implementation of daophot ( originally written by @xcite ) , which constructs a model point - spread function ( psf ) from selected stars and fits these to the program stars . because the centroid information is contained in the steep sides of the psf , a small fitting radius was used , generally 0.8 arcsec .",
    "for some of the later measurements , the fitting radius was adapted to the seeing on the individual pictures .",
    "the measurement procedure was automated as follows .",
    "first , the average of several of the best pictures ( the ` fiducial ' frame ) was examined to select a set of stars to measure and a set of suitable psf stars .",
    "next , lists of stars on all the pictures frames were generated using _",
    "daofind _ or _ sextractor _ @xcite .",
    "a computer program matched objects on these lists to the corresponding objects on the fiducial frame , and the matches were used to transform the program and psf star coordinates to the system of each picture .",
    "the daophot measurements proceeded automatically .    to determine the true scale and orientation of the fiducial frame , the star images were matched to the usno a2.0 catalog @xcite , which is aligned with the icrs ( essentially j2000 ) . in most fields several dozen stars were matched , with plate solutions typically having rms residuals of @xmath17 , mostly from the centering uncertainty of the usno a2.0 and proper motions since the usno a2.0 plate epoch .",
    "given the number of stars in the solutions and the size of the field , the image scales derived from these fits should be accurate to a few parts in @xmath18 , and the orientation should be accurate to a @xmath19 degree . using the scale and orientation , the pixel coordinates of the fiducial stars",
    "were transformed to tangent plane coordinates @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with the program object at the origin .",
    "these coordinates correspond closely to @xmath22 and @xmath23 over a small field .",
    "once the fiducial stars were characterized , a computer program collated the daophot image centers from the original pictures , and generated a master raw data file containing the fixed information about the measured stars , the celestial location , the julian dates of the exposures , and the measured image centers @xmath24 from all the pictures . in addition , a weight of zero or one was assigned to each star indicating whether it was to be used in generating coordinate transformations .",
    "the program star was never used for the coordinate transformations , and other stars were eliminated from the transformations if preliminary analysis showed large scatter or ( in some cases ) large proper motions or parallaxes .",
    "the analysis proceeded in several steps as follows :    _ 1 : computable corrections .",
    "_ for each star , corrections for differential refraction , differential aberration , and dcr were computed , in the ( @xmath25 ) system .",
    "a transformation was derived between ( @xmath26 ) and ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the net correction was transformed back to the ( @xmath28 ) system , and added to the original coordinates .",
    "thus the coordinates were ` born corrected ' .",
    "routines adapted from _ skycalc _ performed the spherical trigonometry calculations .",
    "tests showed that with the exception of dcr ( discussed below ) , these corrections generally made relatively little difference to the results , because their effects were largely absorbed by the ` plate model ' later in the process .",
    "the dcr correction calls for some discussion .",
    "early experiments with fields deliberately taken both near and far from the meridian suggested a dcr coefficient near 7 mas per unit ( @xmath29 ) per unit @xmath30 , whereas the polynomial given by usno92 implies a value of 29 in the same units for their broader passband .",
    "i checked the empirically - derived dcr coefficient using a procedure outlined by @xcite , as follows .",
    "library spectra from @xcite were convolved with passbands from @xcite to compute effective wavelengths as a function of @xmath31 , and a _ slalib _ @xcite routine was used to to find the refraction as a function of wavelength .",
    "the final result was 5 mas per unit ( @xmath29 ) per unit @xmath32 , in reasonable agreement with the empirical 7 . to verify the procedure ,",
    "the calculation was repeated for the usno92 passband ( approximated as flat across their coverage ) , and their value of 29 units was recovered successfully .    _ 2 : position averaging . _",
    "the ( @xmath26 ) coordinates were transformed to the system outlined by ( @xmath33 ) , using a four - constant plate model ( which allows only shifts in zero point , a rigid rotation , and a scale change ) .",
    "these positions were averaged to create refined positions ( @xmath34 ) for each star .",
    "the errors in these positions were much reduced because of averaging over many frames and because of the previous step s removal of computable offsets .    _",
    "3 : iteration . _",
    "the transformations between ( @xmath26 ) and the @xmath35 system were computed again using ( @xmath34 ) as the target coordinates and using a more flexible plate model of the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the radial distance from the fiducial point at the middle of the field , and similarly for @xmath38 .",
    "this model was needed to adequately account for variable systematic distortions across the wide field of view .",
    "the ( @xmath26 ) coordinates were transformed onto this system , and residuals were formed by subtracting away ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "these formed the time series of offsets in @xmath39 and @xmath38 to be fitted in the next step .",
    "_ 4 : first pass fitting .",
    "_ the residuals of each star were fitted to @xmath40 and similarly for @xmath38 , where @xmath41 is the time ( julian date ) and @xmath42 is its mean , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are small offsets relative to the star s adjusted fiducial position , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are proper motions , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the parallax factors along each axis at time @xmath41 for the star s @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which were computed using a _ skycalc _ routine .",
    "the fitting was done in a somewhat unorthodox manner ; first estimates of the parameters were computed using linear least - squares fits to @xmath39 and @xmath38 separately , and then a numerical steepest descent algorithm was used to minimize @xmath51 ^ 2 + [ y_i - y(t)]^2\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the @xmath53-th data point ; this explicitly couples the @xmath39 and @xmath38 solutions through the common parameter @xmath54 .",
    "1 gives an example of how the residuals are fitted ( though for the data shown all the iterations described below have been performed ) .",
    "_ 5 : iteration ( again ) .",
    "_ the coordinate transformations were computed again , this time adjusting the stars fiducial positions for the proper motion and parallax displacements at the epoch of each picture . in practice",
    "this made little difference , since stars with large enough motions to matter were generally eliminated from the fit earlier in the process because of their large residuals .",
    "residuals between the stars positions on individual frames and their mean positions were again computed and used as the basis for the final step .",
    "_ 6 : final fitting . _ the residuals were fitted again , as in step ( 4 ) above .",
    "formal uncertainties were estimated using the procedure outlined by @xcite ; essentially , error bars were drawn at critical levels of the mean square fit residual .",
    "this procedure assumes that the fitted parameters are uncorrelated .",
    "this is only defensible in this case if the observations extend over enough epochs to cleanly separate parallax and proper motion .",
    "the observations reported here generally satisfy this criterion .",
    "_ 7 : human editing . _ the reduction code allows the user to examine and edit the input data ; the whole process ( 1  6 ) can then be run again .",
    "the fit residuals from individual pictures were examined and pictures with particularly large scatter , generally due to poor seeing , were removed .",
    "the comparison star fits were reviewed individually , and objects with large scatter ( due to faintness or other difficulties such as incipient duplicity ) were eliminated from the reference grid .",
    "the reference stars making the final cut generally had rms residuals below 10 mas . in some instances reference stars",
    "were eliminated because of their large proper motions , which would skew the zero point of the proper motions .",
    "the result of steps 1  7 was a set of parallaxes , proper motions , and formal errors for all the stars which had been measured in each field .",
    "table 2 ( available in full in the electronic version of this paper ) presents this information , along with the celestial coordinates , @xmath16 and @xmath55 magnitudes , rms residuals of the fits , and statistical weights .    a correction to absolute parallax",
    "was estimated as follows . for each star used for the reference frame",
    ", a distance was estimated from the measured @xmath9 and @xmath55 color , using typical main - sequence values tabulated by @xcite .",
    "the straight mean of the estimated reference - star parallaxes was used to correct the relative parallax to absolute .",
    "reddening of the reference stars was not taken into account , nor was the possibility that they might be giants , which we can not exclude . at high latitudes",
    ", giants of the apparent magnitude of the reference stars would be far out in the halo and hence unlikely _ a priori _ ; at lower latitudes , where many more reference stars were available , a few mis - identified giants would lead to a slight overestimation of the very small correction .",
    "the use of @xmath9 magnitudes mitigated the effects of absorption to some extent ; in any case , unaccounted - for extinction would somewhat counter - intuitively tend to make the stars appear closer than their true distances , because the reddening would make the stars appear later - type , and hence absolutely fainter , and hence closer than their true distance .",
    "the extinction would also make the stars appear fainter ( and hence farther away ) , but the former effect more than compensates for the latter .",
    "accordingly , this estimate is in effect an upper limit to the correction .",
    "the corrections were in all cases small , of order 1 mas , and the uncertainty in the correction was ignored .",
    "the number of stars measured in each field was large enough to allow an alternate calculation of the parallax error , as follows .",
    "a set of stars was chosen for proximity on the sky and similarity in brightness , and the scatter of the fitted parallaxes of these stars was taken as an alternate parallax uncertainty .",
    "the magnitude and radius window was adjusted to include @xmath12 stars or more in the sample ; typically stars within 3 arcmin and @xmath10 mag of the program star were included , but this varied widely based on how many stars were available .",
    "the scatter was computed both around zero and around the stars photometric parallaxes , but the photometric parallax adjustments were small enough , and the errors large enough , that this made little difference in practice .",
    "this measure of parallax uncertainty was usually somewhat greater than the fit errors above , but they were not dramatically larger , indicating that the fit errors were not too far off .",
    "nonetheless , these measures are probably more faithful indicators of the true external error , and they were used in the distance estimates given later , except in those cases in which the estimated external error was _ less _ than the formal error , which could happen because of the small number of stars involved .",
    "_ error of a single measurement . _",
    "the scatter around the parallax and proper motion fits for the best , stablest comparison stars is around 6 mas ( vector rms error ) .",
    "this is about double the error obtained at usno with a similar ccd and slightly poorer image scale @xcite .",
    "the short exposure times used in the present study may contribute to this in the following way .",
    "the effectiveness of ` tip - tilt ' adaptive optics schemes demonstrates that bulk image motion is a major contributor to seeing .",
    "typical amplitudes of the bulk image motion are 200 mas or so .",
    "the coherence time of the atmosphere in good seeing is of order 30 milliseconds , so one obtains effectively 30 independent samples of the image motion for each second of exposure time , or 1800 such samples in a typical 60 s exposure .",
    "the image centers should therefore be displaced by approximately ( 200 mas ) /@xmath56 , or around 5 mas . if all the stars suffered the same displacement this would be of no concern , but the seeing only correlates over the isoplanatic patch , which is typically less than a couple of arcmin in size .",
    "indeed , examining residual maps from individual frames in succession , there is a strong impression that residuals correlate over patches of roughly this size and vary from picture to picture .",
    "the usno telescope is also a purpose - built astrometric telescope , while the hiltner telescope is not .",
    "unmodeled optical distortions over the relatively wide field may contribute to the error budget ; the fairly complicated plate model needed to adequately model the reference frame indicates that this is likely the case .",
    "_ accuracy of the proper motions .",
    "_ the formal errors in the proper motions are generally very small , of order 1 mas yr@xmath57 in most cases .",
    "however , no attempt was made to put these in an absolute frame .",
    "scatter diagrams of the proper motions in all of the fields suggest that small - number statistics typically affect the mean reference star motion at the 2 to 3 mas yr@xmath57 level ; as noted earlier , exceptionally high proper motion reference stars were eliminated to avoid skewing the zero point excessively . at high latitudes the reference star grids were relatively sparse and the proper motions noticeably larger than at low latitude , where more distant reference stars are available ; both these effects make the proper motion zero point at high latitude somewhat more loosely defined than at low latitude .",
    "the high - latitude frames often have detectable galaxies , which could in principle constrain the zero point , but it was felt that the centroids of these extended objects could not be defined with sufficient precision to make this worthwhile .      to check the above procedures , i re - observed several of the luyten half - second ( lhs ) stars with precise parallaxes published by @xcite .",
    "these were for the most part not observed as extensively as the program stars , but the agreement is nonetheless satisfactory . because similar sets of comparison stars were used in the two determinations , the correction to absolute parallax is ignored , as it should have almost no effect on the comparison .",
    "table 3 lists the results .",
    "a few of these deserve comment .",
    "lhs 429 is extremely red , and hence requires a relatively large dcr correction .",
    "turning off the dcr correction decreases @xmath58 by about 10 mas , ruining the good agreement with @xcite , and offering a somewhat roundabout check on the dcr correction procedure .",
    "lhs 1801 and 1802 are a common proper motion pair , for which the usno parallaxes differ by 2.5 of their mutual standard deviation ; the mdm parallaxes are internally consistent , though slightly smaller than the usno parallax .",
    "interestingly , there are slight but significant differences in the proper motions between the two stars which are nearly identical in the two determinations , suggesting that orbital motion is detected .",
    "finally , a foreground l3.5 dwarf was discovered serendipitously among the stars measured in the field of lhs 1889 @xcite .",
    "for a uniform distribution of objects in space , the distribution of true parallaxes @xmath54 is proportional to @xmath59 , because the volume element at a distance @xmath60 is proportional to @xmath61 . from this , @xcite show that if parallaxes have substantial relative uncertainties , they tend to systematically underestimate distance .",
    "if the measured parallax @xmath62 is assumed to have gaussian - distributed measurement errors with standard deviation @xmath63 , @xmath54 is distributed as @xmath64 ( the vertical bar in the argument of @xmath65 is read as ` given ' , as is standard ; this is therefore ` the likelihood of @xmath54 given a measurement @xmath62 ' . )",
    "this expression does not include any _ a priori _ constraint on the distance  the objects can be any absolute magnitude , for example . in their treatment",
    "the local maximum of @xmath65 is taken as the best estimate of the true parallax .",
    "if the relative error @xmath66 is small , the maximum of @xmath65 lies near @xmath62 and the correction is fairly minor ; at @xmath67 , for example , the distribution of true parallaxes resembles a gaussian with a peak at @xmath68 .",
    "there is always a formal singularity near @xmath69 , but for small relative error this occurs at distances so large as to be implausible ( see fig . 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "is severe enough that the cumulative distribution function is undefined unless the domain of the probability distribution is restricted to be greater than some nonzero parallax .",
    "] however , as the relative error increases , the singularity near @xmath69 become dominant , and at @xmath70 , the local maximum in @xmath65 disappears and there is no longer a unique estimate of @xmath54 @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "even a ` 4 @xmath71 ' parallax detection is likely to be a near - zero parallax which has been bumped up to the observed value by observational error , because the volume of space at small parallax is so large .",
    "this difficulty at low signal - to - noise might be called the ` lutz - kelker catastrophe ' .",
    "several of the stars studied here have parallaxes in the @xmath72 to @xmath73 range , significant if the lutz - kelker bias is _ not _ taken into account , but formally insignificant if the lutz - kelker correction is taken at face value .",
    "the formal insignificance does not seem plausible , since there is other evidence for the relative proximity of these stars , as follows .",
    "( 1 ) in some cases the cvs have significantly larger proper motions than the reference stars . ( 2 )",
    "the absolute magnitudes can often be constrained by other evidence , and in any case these objects can not have the very high luminosities implied by great distances .",
    "( 3 ) the target stars , which have been selected _ a priori _ as cataclysmic variables , generally have the largest parallaxes , or close to it , among all the stars measured in the field .",
    "the lutz - kelker catastrophe arises because of random fluctuations operating on a skewed underlying parallax population  why should the target stars be singled out ?",
    "we thus seek a way to incorporate our prior expectation that the objects are _ not _ at extreme distance , in order to suppress the lutz - kelker catastrophe .",
    "@xcite themselves remove the formal infinity at zero parallax by arbitrarily imposing a lower limit to the parallax ( their @xmath74 ) .",
    "bayesian probability provides a formal structure for incorporating prior information in parameter estimation @xcite .",
    "i therefore used bayesian inference to construct an _ a posteriori _ probability density for the parallax , using as prior information the proper motion together with an assumed velocity distribution , and the apparent magnitudes together with a broad range of assumed absolute magnitudes .",
    "this approach is cogently detailed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the formalism used here is nearly identical .    in order to make use of the proper motions",
    ", a distribution of velocities must be assumed . with the simplifying assumption of an isotropic velocity distribution ,",
    "the @xmath75-velocities ( i.e. , mean systemic radial velocities ) give a measure of the transverse velocity distribution .",
    "@xcite tabulated observed @xmath75 velocities from the literature and found , for non - magnetic systems , an overall dispersion of 33 km s@xmath57 , without strong dependence on subtype .",
    "one might expect a subtype dependence ",
    "@xcite predict that long - period systems should be relatively young , and hence have a low velocity dispersion , and indeed @xcite find an extremely low velocity dispersion among four systems they studied .",
    "shorter - period systems may be more ancient , and hence have higher dispersions . in order to check this possibility with a possibly more homogeneous sample ,",
    "i collected @xmath75-velocities of systems with @xmath76 hr from published mdm observations @xcite , most of which were not available to @xcite , and from another ten systems for which results are in preparation .",
    "all 28 stars in this sample were observed with similar spectral resolution and calibration procedures , which should minimize excess scatter .",
    "the lsr - corrected velocities had @xmath77 and @xmath78 km s@xmath57 ( excluding rz leo , which had a very poorly - measured orbit ) .",
    "both this result and van paradijs et al.s estimate should be upper limits to @xmath79 , since the emission lines do not necessarily track either star closely .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the shorter period systems appears thus to be quite small , probably only just consistent with the predictions of @xcite ( their fig .",
    "@xcite develops a formalism for computing the _ a priori _ likelihood of a proper motion as a function of distance , when the parent population has a triaxial gaussian velocity distribution aligned with galactic coordinates , with dispersions @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 in the three principal directions ( his equations 25 and 26 ) .",
    "i modified this formalism as follows .",
    "guided by the velocity dispersion results noted above , i assumed the bulk of the cv population to have the kinematics of galactic k0 giants as tabulated in @xcite ( p. 423 ) , with @xmath83 km s@xmath57 .",
    "i added to this a high - velocity tail with a normalization of 0.05 times the bulk population , with ( 100 , 75 , 50 ) km s@xmath57 , similar to the subdwarfs .",
    "finally , i added a lower - velocity core , with 0.2 times the normalization , with ( 24 , 13 , 10 ) km s@xmath57 , similar to f0 dwarfs .",
    "this composite probability density was evaluated over a range of hypothetical true parallaxes .",
    "the proper motion was adjusted to the local standard of rest at each parallax before the probability density was evaluated . the uncertainty in the proper motion determination ( eqn .  27 in @xcite )",
    "was ignored .",
    "the apparent magnitudes of many of these systems can also be used to constrain the distance . @xcite",
    "( also @xcite ) showed that the absolute magnitudes of dwarf novae at maximum light , corrected for inclination , are strongly correlated with @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath76 hr , the maximum magnitude generally occurs in superoutburst , which is about a magnitude brighter than normal outburst ; i assumed this to be the case .",
    "the optical colors of dwarf novae in outburst are fairly close to zero , so the distinction between @xmath84 and @xmath85 is ignored .",
    "the orbital inclinations for most of the program objects are uncertain , so the inclination correction is not known . to account for this and unexpected scatter in the relation , and to avoid ` assuming what we are trying to prove ' , the magnitudes were assumed to follow a very broad gaussian .",
    "sometimes other constraints on the distance were available ( e.g. , from detections of secondary stars ) , and again relatively broad probability distributions were assumed to avoid steering the estimate too much .",
