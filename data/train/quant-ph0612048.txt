    "characterizing and quantifying multipartite entanglement is a problem whose complexity rapidly increases with the number of particles , and a major challenge within current quantum information science . in spite of intensive effort ,",
    "a complete understanding of entanglement properties remains limited to date to few - body small - dimensional composite quantum systems : in particular , such understanding has been achieved for pure states of three two - level systems ( qubits ) @xcite , mixed - state entanglement having also been investigated for this system in @xcite .",
    "thus , the analysis of pure - state entanglement in an ensemble of four qubits is a critical test for any entanglement theory , as it is provides the first highly non - trivial case whose complexity remains tractable .",
    "different approaches have been attempted so far for unraveling the classification of multipartite entanglement , ranging from so - called hyper - determinants @xcite , to normal forms @xcite , and invariants @xcite and covariants @xcite of the relevant group of local transformations .",
    "even if such methods offer equivalent answers for ensembles of two or three qubits , a complete description of four - qubit entanglement has only been obtained by verstraete _",
    "et al _ @xcite based on the method of normal forms , which simplifies considerably in this case thanks to the fact that the group @xmath0 is isomorphic to @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting classification has been partially independently verified in @xcite .",
    "closely related with the problem of classification is , in turn , the problem of quantifying entanglement through appropriate measures , as the identification of proper classes should provide the physical boundaries for prospective measures .",
    "in addition , the invariants which are often utilized to discriminate among different entanglement classes satisfy themselves the minimum set of requirements that measures are expected to fulfill @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we tackle the problem of pure - state four - qubit entanglement via a recently introduced approach based on _ nilpotent polynomials _ @xcite .",
    "in addition to providing a simple entanglement criterion for any bipartition of a multipartite ensemble , the nilpotent method has the advantage of offering , in principle , a physically motivated procedure for entanglement classification , based on the idea of reducing the nilpotent polynomials to suitable _ canonic _ forms , which are _ extensive _ with respect to the number of subsystems and _ invariant _ under the desired groups of transformations . such a reduction procedure is considerably facilitated if the dynamical equations of the polynomials are derived and employed .",
    "the coefficients of the resulting invariant forms have the same values as polynomial invariants , and may then be used for constructing measures of entanglement .",
    "the content of the paper is organized as follows . after recalling in sec .",
    "[ seci ] the basic ingredients of the general nilpotent formalism , we specialize it in sec .",
    "[ secii ] to the four - qubit setting , and derive both general and special entanglement classes for this ensemble .",
    "note that we obtain more entanglement classes than in @xcite , as a consequence of the fact that we consider at each stage of our reduction procedure transformations that preserve the canonic form of the nilpotent polynomials . in sec .",
    "[ seciii ] , the problem of entanglement quantification is discussed in terms of the invariant coefficients of the nilpotent polynomials .",
    "measures for comparing entanglement within classes are proposed , as well as a measure of genuine fourpartite entanglement .",

    "with respect to the computational basis in @xmath4 , @xmath2 may be expressed in the form@xmath5where @xmath6 . by introducing pseudospin creation operators @xmath7 ,",
    "the above expression may be rewritten as @xmath8that is , a polynomial in the nilpotent operator @xmath9 ( recall that @xmath10 due to pauli algebra ) , acting on the vacuum ( or reference ) state @xmath11 . by setting the population of the latter to be maximal ( equal to one ) , we construct , equivalently , the nilpotent polynomial @xmath12 , @xmath13furthermore , by taking the logarithm of @xmath12 , and by taylor - expanding around the unit value of the vacuum state population , we obtain the _ nilpotential _",

    "the following criterion holds @xcite :    * the entanglement criterion : * _ the subsets _ @xmath16__and _ _ @xmath17 _  of a binary partition of an assembly of _ @xmath3 _",
    "_  qubits are unentangled iff _ _",
    "@xmath18thus , @xmath16 and@xmath19 are disentangled iff @xmath20 .    in spite of the fact that the nilpotential @xmath14 gives the possibility of applying the above entanglement criterion ,",
    "@xmath14 may not yet be regarded as a satisfactory description of entanglement present in the overall composite system , as the latter should naturally be invariant under operations which act _ locally _ on individual subsystems only ( see @xcite for a generalization of entanglement _ beyond _ the distinguishable subsystem framework we focus on here ) . the local transformations on each qubit may either be considered to be restricted to unitary transformations in @xmath21  in which case , we talk about @xmath22-entanglement  or they may be more generally allowed to be any invertible transformation in @xmath23  in which case , we talk about @xmath24-entanglement .",
    "physically , the latter correspond to the family of _ stochastic local operations assisted by classical communication operations _",

    ", the state vector undergoes changes but still remains within a subset @xmath25 , which coincides with a @xmath22-orbit ( or , respectively , @xmath24-orbit ) within the overall hilbert space @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the nilpotential @xmath14 should retain the same form for all states belonging to a given orbit , and a _ canonic _ form of the resulting nilpotential may accordingly be taken as an `` orbit marker '' .",
    "canonic forms may be used as an alternative to the method of invariants @xcite for identifying different orbits , thereby entanglement classes .",
    "the number of independent ( real ) parameters in a given canonic form should equal the number of independent invariants identifying the orbit , or else equal the dimension of the coset @xmath27 .    according to the general arguments given in @xcite , the _",
    "@xmath22-canonic nilpotential _ is defined as the nilpotential of the state in the orbit with the maximum reference state population . under this condition ,",
    "the orbit - marker is the canonic nilpotential , which we also term the _ su - tanglemeter _ , @xmath28 , @xmath29where the @xmath3 linear terms are absent and",
    "the number of parameters involved equals the dimension of the coset , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .    in order to construct the _",
    "@xmath24-canonic nilpotential _ , or @xmath24-tanglemeter , we begin with the tanglemeter @xmath28 , and we further reduce the number of parameters down to @xmath32 , @xmath33 . to achieve this",
    "we impose the following conditions : in addition to the requirement for @xmath28 that all @xmath3 terms linear in @xmath34 be equal to zero , we require that _ all @xmath3 terms of @xmath35-th order vanish as well_. thus , the @xmath24-tanglemeter , @xmath36 , takes the form @xmath37 since @xmath38 , different @xmath22-orbits may become equivalent under local @xmath39-transformations .",
    "for this reason , the classification given by @xmath39 is more general than the one given by @xmath40 , thus usually the term entanglement classes  is taken to refer to different @xmath24-orbits .    given an arbitrary pure state @xmath2 , the task of determining the tanglemeter by applying local operations is , in general , not trivial .",
    "the difficulty is substantially reduced if one is able to take advantage of explicit dynamical equation obeyed by the nilpotential of the state , subject to appropriate consistency ( or `` feedback '' ) conditions . for qubit systems ,",
    "the dynamic equation reads @xmath41where the generators of the local operations@xmath42should be formally substituted as @xmath43    for the special case of local _ unitary _ operations , @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ eq48 ] ) , and the feedback conditions for obtaining @xmath28 are @xmath45where @xmath46are the coefficients of the linear terms in the nilpotential at a given time .    a similar procedure for reducing the nilpotential to the canonic form @xmath47 may be carried out also for @xmath39-transformations .",
    "we begin in this case by reducing @xmath14 to the tanglemeter @xmath28 , so that the terms linear in @xmath48 vanish .",

    "the two feedback conditions to be imposed in this case are : ( i ) the condition @xmath53expressing @xmath49 via @xmath50 , which ensures that the nilpotential remains in the form of a tanglemeter at each stage ; and ( ii ) the condition @xmath54 \\right\\vert _ { \\sigma \\rightarrow 0 } , \\label{eq62b}\\]]which ensures the exponential decrease of all @xmath3 coefficients in front of the second - highest order terms .",
    "unfortunately , no immediate physical meaning seems to be attributable in general to the requirements of vanishing of the @xmath24-tanglemeter coefficients of @xmath55-th order  in contrast to the case of @xmath40 transformations , where vanishing of the first - order terms reflects maximum ground state population .",
    "mathematically , however , such a requirement is suggested by symmetry considerations : @xmath3 complex conditions are imposed on @xmath3 complex coefficients of the same type . after having eliminated the monomials of orders @xmath56 and @xmath35 , it is possible to specify the scaling parameters @xmath57 so that @xmath3 additional conditions are imposed on the tanglemeter coefficients .",
    "for example , we can set to unity the coefficients in front of the highest order term , and adjust @xmath35 coefficients in front of certain monomials to be equal to @xmath35 coefficients of other monomials .    the condition in eq .",
    "( [ eq62b ] ) for @xmath58 is written implicitly as a set of @xmath3 linear equations that can be solved for _ generic _ states .",
    "however , no solution exists for those @xmath58 parameters corresponding to a zero determinant .",
    "such singularities may correspond to _ special _ classes of entangled states which require separate consideration  as we are going to see explicitly in the four - qubit example .",
    "a generic normalized pure state of four qubits may be described by @xmath59 real parameters .",
    "the @xmath22-entanglement of this state requires less parameters to be characterized , @xmath60 and , according to the discussion in sec .",
    "[ seci ] , for four qubits the @xmath22-tanglemeter defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq13a ] ) reads @xmath61 in the above expression , we have used the local phase operations that did not contribute to the elimination of the linear coefficients to make the trilinear coefficients @xmath62 real numbers .",
    "in addition , a compact notation has been introduced by considering the indexes of @xmath63 as a binary representation of decimal numbers , e.g. , @xmath64 , _",
    "etc_.    allowing for more general local transformations on each qubit , such as indirect measurements with stochastic outcomes , the number of the parameters necessary to describe a state may be further reduced .",
    "the @xmath24-tanglemeter ( [ eq14a ] ) of a generic state of four qubits contains @xmath65 real parameters , and may be cast in the following form : @xmath66where the scaling factors ( that is , the parameter in front of @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ eq48 ] ) ) , have been chosen so that the @xmath47 becomes equivalent to the expression @xmath68 in _ theorem 2 _ of @xcite .",
    "we proceed to explicitly illustrate the procedure for evaluating the @xmath24-tanglemeter in eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) by means of the dynamic equations ( [ eq21af])-([eq48 ] ) , starting from the @xmath22-tanglemeter given in eq .",
    "( [ eq14.4 ] ) .",
    "first , one may notice that in the system of eleven first - order nonlinear differential equations for the coefficients @xmath69 , the coupling of the second - order terms @xmath70 to the fourth - order term @xmath71 occurs via the third - order terms @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the time evolution of all @xmath69 stops when these third - order coefficients @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath63 , and @xmath78 vanish  indicating that for four qubits the @xmath24-tanglemeter is a stationary solution for the dynamic equations . if the coefficients @xmath49 satisfy the requirement of eq .",
    "( [ eq62a ] ) , which ensures that the _ nilpotential always remains in the form of a valid @xmath22-tanglemeter @xmath28 during such evolution _",
    ", what it is left is to adjust the time dependence of the parameters @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 so that they drive all four third - order coefficients to zero .    from the differential equations of the third - order coefficients,@xmath83we see that ,",
    "in the general case , feedback conditions may be imposed by a proper choice of the parameters @xmath50 , in such a way that these equations take the form @xmath84the evolution implied by these equations brings , in turn , the nilpotential to the following form : @xmath85we can invoke the four scaling operators @xmath86 , and further reduce eq .",
    "( [ eq14b ] ) to the @xmath24-canonic form @xmath47 of eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) , unless one or more of the above @xmath63 coefficients vanish .",
    "such cases correspond to zero - measure manifolds  in other words , to special classes of entanglement .",
    "for example , when @xmath87 in  ( [ eq14b ] ) , the tanglemeter may be cast , by scaling , in the form @xmath88characterized by only two parameters .",
    "if @xmath89 , the @xmath24-tanglemeter reads @xmath90which only involves a single parameter .",
    "lastly , if @xmath91 , @xmath92note that the tanglemeters of eqs .",
    "( [ eq16a ] ) , ( [ eq16b ] ) , and ( [ eq16c ] ) correspond to the special families @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 of the classification given in _ theorem 2 _ of @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to bear in mind that the latter classification applies to _ un_-normalized states , whereas our tanglemeter corresponds to states of unit population in the reference state .    when the fourth - order coefficient @xmath96 and , additionally , one or more of the quadratic coefficients are also zero , singular classes of states without genuine fourpartite entanglement emerge : for instance , the @xmath24-tanglemeter of a four - qubit @xmath97 state , @xmath98belongs to one of such classes , and separable states with tanglemeters of the type @xmath99and similar , belong to other .    on the other hand , reducing @xmath100 to the canonic @xmath24-form @xmath47 can not be achieved when the determinant @xmath101of the system of differential equations ( [ eq62d ] ) vanishes  which makes it impossible to impose any required feedback conditions .",
    "in such a situation , we loose the functional independence of the right hand sides of ( [ eq62d ] ) , which ensures complete controllability of the dynamics of @xmath102 , @xmath77 , @xmath103 , and @xmath78 in the generic case .",
    "in turn , this means that some linear combinations of these coefficients , determined by the system s eigenvectors , can not be set to zero by any choice of @xmath50 , and a tanglemeter @xmath47 of a special form should be defined in such instances . in @xcite ,",
    "four special families of tanglemeters are derived,@xmath104 @xmath105@xmath106@xmath107corresponding , respectively , to one , two , three , or four of the eigenvalues @xmath108 of @xmath109 vanishing , where explicitly @xmath110observe that the number of parameters in such special tanglemeters is @xmath111 complex numbers , the same as in the general case given in eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) .    at present",
    ", it remains to be proved whether all four special tanglemeters ( [ eq14.4a])-([eq14.44d ] ) correspond to distinct special entanglement classes , since they result from considering a dynamic evolution based on a series of sequential _ infinitesimal _ local operations which preserve the @xmath22-canonic form of the nilpotential .",
    "thus , a situation where some of the obtained tanglemeters turn out to be equivalent under a _ finite _ local @xmath24-transformation , can not be ruled out in principle by our current approach . in @xcite , such special classes are not explicitly identified , although the last three classes of _ theorem 2 _  that is , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 , may be easily identified as special cases of eq .",
    "( [ eq14.44d ] ) when one or more terms vanish .",

    "from an information - theoretic standpoint , the construction of well - defined entanglement measures typically relies on the concept of _ entanglement monotone _ , that is , of a quantity that is required to be invariant under local unitary transformations and non - increasing on average under locc transformations @xcite .",
    "for instance , the most widely utilized measures for two and three qubits , the _ concurrence _ , @xmath117 , and the _ residual entanglement _ ( or 3-tangle ) , @xmath118 , @xcite are entanglement monotones . for a four - qubit system , we have seen in sec .",
    "[ secii ] that the classification is much richer than in the case of three qubits . in the context of such a classification , we would like to first revisit the role of entanglement monotones , and then argue that another class of measures may also be meaningful .",
    "in particular , we show how a measure for fourpartite entanglement should be also more precisely defined by imposing additional requirements beside the ones mentioned above .",
    "a standard way to construct entanglement monotones is based on exploiting polynomial ( algebraic ) invariants .",
    "polynomial invariants are polynomial functions of the state coefficients , and a linearly independent finite set of them may be used to distinguish different orbits in the same way the set of invariant tanglemeter s coefficients does .",
    "for example , for a three - qubit system , five ( as many as the tanglemeter s parameters ) independent invariants under local unitary transformations exist @xcite , namely the three real numbers @xmath119and the real and the imaginary part of a complex number , @xmath120 in the above equations , @xmath121 , with the convention that summation over repeated indexes ranging over @xmath122 is left implicit , @xmath123 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath124 , and @xmath125 is the antisymmetric tensor of rank @xmath126 .",
    "the @xmath22-invariant quantity @xmath127 is exactly the 3-tangle , which also remains invariant under the class of local transformations @xmath128 .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that @xmath24-invariants behave as entanglement monotones for normalized pure states , since the ( square ) vector length @xmath129 is non - increasing under @xmath24-transformations and thus may be employed as a measure of @xmath22-entanglement within a given @xmath24 orbit .",
    "the main reason for choosing such a vector length as a measure is based on the relation between the determinant @xmath130 of the physical transformation corresponding to the chosen @xmath24-transformation and the probability @xmath131 of the desired outcome of the indirect measurement implementing this transformation : the @xmath132-th power of the probability upper - bounds the determinant , @xmath133 .",
    "note that , by definition , an entanglement monotone is an object able to quantify @xmath22-entanglement by distinguishing different @xmath22-orbits that belong to the same @xmath24-orbit .",
    "however , in the case of four ( or more ) qubits , there exists an infinite number of general @xmath24-orbits ( see sec .",
    "[ secii ] ) .",
    "this suggests that measures able to compare the _",
    "@xmath24-entanglement between such general orbits _ should be considered in addition to the @xmath22-measures . a reasonable suggestion for @xmath24-entanglement measures",
    "is provided by @xmath24-invariants that are also scaling invariants and , therefore , are independent of the specific normalization of the state .",
    "one may construct @xmath24-invariants for a four - qubit ensemble in a way similar to how the invariant @xmath134 of eq .",
    "( [ eq3a ] ) is constructed ; that is , by taking products of several factors @xmath135 ( but not factors @xmath136 ) and by considering contractions over @xmath21-indexes with invariant antisymmetric tensors @xmath125 .",
    "the simplest combination one finds in this way , @xmath137is a @xmath24-invariant of second order .",
    "there also exist three different @xmath24-invariants of fourth order , @xmath138the ratios @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 are , in addition , invariant with respect to multiplication of the state vector by an arbitrary complex constant . were these ratio linearly independent , they would suffice for a complete characterization of four - qubit entanglement .",
    "however , they are not . the following identity , @xmath142makes such quantities inconvenient for entanglement characterization .",
    "thus , it is necessary to turn to the sixth - order invariants .",
    "we consider the following three independent combinations , @xmath143 whose differences give the invariants of eq .",
    "( [ 4-th ] ) multiplied by @xmath144 .",
    "the explicit form of these invariants for a generic state is awkward .",
    "however , they take a simple form for the canonic state under @xmath24-transformations , which allows us to explicitly relate them to the canonic amplitudes .",
    "one finds @xmath145where @xmath146 is a root of the following cubic equation : @xmath147the set of eqs .",
    "( [ ampl ] ) determines the canonic state vector form with respect to pure @xmath39-transformations . upon dividing eqs .",
    "( [ ampl ] ) by @xmath148 the ratios @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 respectively yield the @xmath24-tanglemeter coefficients @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 , which are also scaling - invariant . different roots of the cubic equation ( [ qe ] ) yield different @xmath24-canonic states related by @xmath39 transformations .",
    "we can choose one particular root by minimizing the difference between the normalization of the canonic state and the initial normalization .",
    "thus , as conjectured in sec .",
    "[ secii ] , the @xmath24-entanglement in the four - qubit assembly may be completely characterized by _ three independent scale - invariant complex ratios _ , @xmath155emerging from the invariants of eqs .",

    "this yields @xmath158 @xmath159 for the ghz canonic state , whereas @xmath160 @xmath159 for all other states , thereby exhibiting a similar behavior to the hyper - determinant @xcite .",
    "accordingly , this measure quantifies how close the orbit is to the ghz - orbit .",
    "the quantity @xmath161 may likewise serve as a measure characterizing the distance between two different @xmath24-orbits .    as a next question ,",
    "we wish to suggest a simple measure for characterizing @xmath22-entanglement in four qubits .",
    "a natural candidate is the sum @xmath162 over the probabilities in eq .",

    "( [ j2])-([6-th ] ) are calculated for a state with unit normalization , this sum quantifies the extent by which the @xmath39 transformation required for setting the state to the canonic form differs from a unitary transformation .",

    "the latter quantity is able to discriminate between different @xmath22-orbits that belong to the same @xmath24-orbit .",

    "having suggested @xmath24- and @xmath22-measures for four qubits in terms of the tanglemeter s coefficients , we finally proceed to address the more delicate issue of constructing a measure of genuine fourpartite entanglement @xcite .",
    "in addition to behaving as an entanglement monotone , such a measure should satisfy the requirement of being zero in the @xmath24-orbits that do not bear genuine fourpartite entanglement . within constructions based on @xmath24-invariants ( different approaches",
    "have also been suggested , see e.g. @xcite ) , the combination of invariants able to satisfy the last requirement is not known to date .",

    "the so - called @xmath164-concurrence introduced in @xcite , that is just @xmath165 , exhibits a similar unfavorable behavior . on the other hand , the hyper - determinant @xmath166 @xcite is nonzero in the general family of orbits @xmath68 , and zero in all others as well as in the ghz orbit .",
    "according to our results ( table i ) , recall that the families of orbits @xmath167 , @xmath94 , and @xmath168 are derived as special cases of the general family , and also contain genuine fourpartite entanglement in general .    observing that the determinant @xmath109 of the infinitesimal transformations given in eq .",

    "here , the normalization @xmath173 ensures that @xmath174 consistently ranges between @xmath175 .",
    "note that @xmath174 is constructed as a function of @xmath22-canonic amplitudes , thus it remains invariant under local unitary transformations , while it is not a @xmath24-invariant .    in order to gain further insight into the properties of @xmath174 , its behavior on a typical four - qubit state",
    "is numerically investigated .",
    "the distribution of @xmath174 for pure states sampled uniformly over the haar measure is depicted in fig .",
    "a non - monotonic behavior is clearly seen , peaked around the value @xmath176 , qualitatively resembling the distribution of the @xmath111-tangle for three - qubit pure states @xcite .",
    "unlike the @xmath164-concurrence , @xmath174 attains its maximum value @xmath56 for the ghz state , and gives zero for all the states which are separable in some way .",
    "for a four qubit cluster state @xcite , for instance , it gives @xmath177 , which is well above the average value .",
    "while the above features make @xmath174 an attractive candidate for quantifying fourpartite entanglement , a main disadvantage of @xmath174 is that it inherits the redundancy of our classification , vanishing whenever the general class of orbits can not be reached by infinitesimal transformations  irrespective of whether it might be reached by finite transformations .",
    "furthermore , the calculation of @xmath174 for a given pure state requires in general that the latter is first reduced to its @xmath22-canonic form . on the other hand ,",
    "extending the construction of this measure to @xmath178 qubits is relatively straightforward in principle . for @xmath179 ,",
    "the fact that the determinant @xmath180 does not contain the second - highest order terms is a sign that this measure is approximate for arbitrary states .",
    "however , this effect may expected to become less pronounced ( hence the accuracy of such approximation improves ) with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "finally , it remains an open question to ascertain whether this measure is an entanglement monotone .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated how the approach based on nilpotent polynomials may be employed to identify entanglement classes for the illustrative yet highly nontrivial situation of four qubits in a pure state .",
    "even if the approach is somewhat redundant compared to mathematically more sophisticated methods , we believe it has the advantage of offering a clearer physical interpretation , and it may also be extended straightforwardly to larger multipartite ensembles and higher - dimensional subsystems .    in the context of the resulting classification , we have suggested additional class of measures beside the existing ones , which remain invariant under either local unitary ( @xmath22 ) or arbitrary local invertible ( @xmath24 ) transformations .",
    "we employ the nilpotent invariant coefficients for the construction of such measures as an alternative route to invoking polynomial algebraic invariants .",
    "finally , we have also suggested a measure of genuine fourpartite entanglement .",
    "our prospective measure is both , by construction , a @xmath22-invariant and it vanishes on the special orbits where no genuine fourpartite entanglement exists .",
    "we also note that while it would be very illustrative to apply the nilpotent method in the well - explored three qubit case , the procedure implemented here is not viable , since in this case the @xmath39 coset dimension @xmath181 and , consequently , the dynamical set of equations employed in the analysis becomes degenerate .",
    "it is our hope that the results presented here may serve as a stimulus to prompt further investigations and applications of the nilpotent polynomial formalism as a tool exploring entanglement .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank vladimir akulin and andrei smilga for insightful discussions and collaboration on the nilpotent entanglement program .",
    "the authors are also indebted to winton g. brown for valuable suggestions and a critical reading of the manuscript . am gratefully acknowledges ile de france for financial support .",
