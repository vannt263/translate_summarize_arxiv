    "in recent years , dynamics of electroweak bubbles , associated with a first order phase transition , has been studied in the standard model ( sm ) [ 1 - 11 ] and its extensions [ 12 - 15 ] , two - higgs doublet model ( tdhm ) [ 16 ] , the minimally supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) [ 17 , 18 ] as well as in model - independent way [ 19,20 ] .",
    "also , aspects of gravitational waves ( gw ) , as would be generated by bubble collisions and due to turbulence in the plasma have been investigated [ 21 - 28 ] .",
    "knowledge of bubble dynamics and the concomitant cp violation [ 29 ] help us to understand the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) and electroweak baryogenesis ( ewbg ) scenario in more detail in a specific model .",
    "depending on the strength of the first - order phase transition and the nature of the finite - temperature effective potential ( ftep ) in a model calculation , the motion of the bubble wall may belong to various categories , viz . ,",
    "deflagrations , detonations , hybrids or runaway [ 20 ] . also , the motion can be supersonic , jouguet or subsonic depending on whether the velocity of the plasma inside the bubble is greater than , equal to or less than the sound velocity in the medium , respectively .",
    "usually , deflagrations are subsonic and detonations are supersonic .",
    "however , no clear - cut classification can be made in this regard .",
    "although hydrodynamical equations give general features of bubble wall motion , microscopic analysis including friction of the bubble wall is necessary for getting the detailed information regarding the bubble wall velocity [ 13 , 20 ] .",
    "gravitational waves , which are considered to be the essential features of einstein s general theory of relativity , have not been experimentally detected so far , although efforts are on in this direction [ 28 ] .",
    "gravitational waves at the electroweak scale are believed to have been generated either by bubble wall collisions or by turbulence of the plasma .",
    "the littlest higgs model ( @xmath0hm ) [ 30 ] and the littlest higgs model with t parity ( lht)[31 - 33 ] are economical beyond standard models ( bsm ) which can solve the little hierarchy problem . the lht conforms to the electroweak precision data . in order to explore the prospects of ewpt and ewbg ,",
    "finite - temperature calculations have been performed [ 34 - 36 ] in these models . in ref .",
    "36 , an inverse strong first order ewpt has been observed in the global structure of the effective potential at the value of the physical higgs field , @xmath1 tev with transition temperature , @xmath2 tev .    in ref .",
    "37 , a two - step baryogenesis scenario associated with the inverse phase transition in the tev scale has been presented . in the first step",
    ", the universe makes a transition from an electroweak broken phase above @xmath3 to a symmetric phase below @xmath3 .",
    "bubbles of symmetric phase are formed in the background of asymmetric phase .",
    "baryon number violations take place within these bubbles due to sphaleron transitions induced by t even massless gauge boson fields . in the second step ,",
    "a cross - over takes place at @xmath4 tev and the process of baryogenesis gets completed between the temperatures , 0.9 tev and 0.1 tev .    in view of the proposed new aspects [ 36 ] of the ewpt at the tev scale and the associated ewbg scenario [ 37 ]",
    ", we expect to find new features of the bubble dynamics as well as gw in the lht .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine the properties of the symmetric phase bubbles associated with an inverse strong first order ewpt and a new baryogenesis scenario therewith . in section",
    "ii , we demonstrate the expansion of the symmetric phase bubbles . in section iii",
    ", we calculate the bubble nucleation rate and time and in section iv , we study the bubble wall velocity . in section v we investigate the features of gravitational wave generation in our model .",
    "finally , in section vi we make some concluding remarks .",
    "the presence of bubbles in the model under consideration is schematically shown in fig.1 . here",
    "we have a situation which is opposite to that in the case of sm , viz .",
    ", we have the symmetric phase bubbles in the background of the asymmetric phase . whether these bubbles will contract or expand",
    "will depend on the difference of pressure in the two phases .",
    "the pressures are completely determined by the ftep [ 36 ] and can be written as [ 4 ] , @xmath5 where , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the pressures inside and outside the bubbles respectively . it should be noted that @xmath8 is the value of the physical higgs field , where the phase transition is observed .    .",
    "outside the bubbles , @xmath9 tev . ]",
    "so far as the ftep is concerned , two comments are in order here .",
    "firstly , in the calculation of ftep in ref .",
    "36 , the effects of mirror fermions , which are instrumental in the non - minimal cp violation [ 38 ] in the lht models , were not taken .",
    "subsequently , we have found that the inclusion of these fermions in the ftep does not change the features of the phase transition - the value of @xmath3 changes from 0.925 tev to 0.905 tev and the position of the minimum of the higgs field remains the same .",
    "however , to be accurate , for the pressure calculations here , we have included the mirror fermions in the ftep . the value of the mirror fermion coupling constant @xmath10 has been taken to be 0.7 consistent with a reasonable value of the mirror fermion mass , viz . , 0.5 tev [ 39 ] .",
    "the second comment concerns the recently discovered [ 40 , 41 ] sm higgs of mass , @xmath11 gev at the lhc .",
    "this translates into value of higgs quartic coupling constant , @xmath12 , @xmath13 being the sm higgs vev , 246 gev . with this value of @xmath14",
    ", we get a set of ultraviolet ( uv ) completion factors as @xmath15 , @xmath16 for our ftep , consistent with the experimental value of the sm higgs vev at zero temperature . here",
    "the uv completion factors are defined as the quantities which take care of the physics above the cut - off scale , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the high energy symmetry breaking scale .",
    "it may be noted here that the general procedure for obtaining the uv completion factors in our model is described in ref .",
    "36 .        with the above considerations and eq.1 we have calculated the quantity , ( @xmath19 ) of which the plot is shown in fig.2 .",
    "we observe that the excess pressure within the symmetric phase bubbles is always positive . from this",
    "we may conclude that after the inverse ewpt at @xmath3=0.9 tev , the symmetric phase bubbles will expand in the background of the asymmetric phase .",
    "the excess free energy [ 3 ] in a true vacuum bubble , which is a symmetric phase bubble in the present case , can be written as , @xmath20dr},\\ ] ] where , we have assumed that the bubble is spherical and @xmath21 is the radius of the bubble .",
    "@xmath22 is the same as the three - dimensional euclidean action , @xmath23 [ 42 ] which is related to the four - dimensional euclidean action @xmath24 as @xmath25 in the imaginary time formalism of finite - temperature field theory .",
    "eq.2 is the energy which causes the symmetric phase bubble to expand in the present scenario .",
    "the derivative term in eq.2 corresponds to a surface energy and the potential term a volume energy . in the thin wall approximation ,",
    "appropriate for a strong first - order phase transition , the derivative of the higgs field can be written as [ 42 ] , @xmath26 in the limit of exact degeneracy of the potential minima at @xmath27 .",
    "a positive value of the derivative would reflect the fact that in our case as we go from the centre of a symmetric phase bubble to the boundary , the vev of @xmath28 increases from 0 to 1.1 tev . to avoid using an ansatz of the field in the @xmath29 space",
    ", we then change the integration variable from @xmath29 to @xmath28 and approximate the surface term as , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 can be called the surface energy density .",
    "we also write the volume term in eq.2 as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an average effective potential inside the bubble .",
    "since the potential inside the bubble should be measured with respect to that outside , we can write @xmath34 .",
    "thus , we write the volume term as , @xmath35 .    now",
    ", we get the radius of a critical bubble by minimizing @xmath36 from the equation , @xmath37_{r = { r_c } } } = 0 $ ] with @xmath38 and thus @xmath39 .",
    "the bubble nucleation rate per unit time per unit volume can be written in terms of the excess free energy @xmath40 of the critical bubble as [ 43,18 ] , @xmath41^{3/2}}exp\\left [ { - \\frac{{\\delta { f_c}(t)}}{t } } \\right]\\ ] ] the bubble nucleation temperature @xmath42 , which is somewhat lower than @xmath3 in the case of first order phase transition , is defined as the temperature at which the rate of nucleation of a critical bubble within a horizon volume is equal to the hubble parameter at that temperature .",
    "since the horizon scale is approximately @xmath43 the nucleation temperature can be defined by the equation , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the relativistic degrees of freedom and @xmath46 is the planck mass . from eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , we get , @xmath47 - 143.46 + 2\\ln \\left [ { { g_*}({t_n } ) } \\right ] + 4\\ln { t_n } \\simeq 0\\ ] ]     vs. @xmath42 where @xmath48 is the function on the left hand side of eq.5 and @xmath42 is the bubble nucleation temperature . ]",
    "eq.5 can be graphically solved for @xmath42 . denoting the lhs of eq.5 as @xmath49",
    ", we show in fig.3 a plot of @xmath49 vs. @xmath42 .",
    "the graph shows that @xmath50 for @xmath51 tev .",
    "the nucleation temperature can also be determined from the consideration of the fact that the space - time integrated nucleation rate ( i.e. , the nucleation probability ) should be of order 1[13 ] : @xmath52 now the horizon scale is roughly @xmath53 and so , volume = @xmath54 . using the time - temperature relations [ 42 , 13 ] , @xmath55 we get the integral in eq.6 , which is the total nucleation probability of a single bubble , as , @xmath56^{3/2}}exp\\left",
    "[ { - \\delta { f_c}(t)/t } \\right]dt\\ ] ] results of evaluation of this integral for different values of @xmath42 are shown in table 1 .",
    ".nucleation temperature , excess free - energy and the nucleation probability ( integral i in eq.8 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the fitted polynomial is , @xmath57 differentiating the function ( eq.51 ) with respect to @xmath58 we can get the value of @xmath59 at a particular temperature .    in ref.20 an expression of efficiency factor for supersonic deflagration has been derived in model - independent way : @xmath60 @xmath61 and @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the sound and jouguet velocities respectively .",
    "@xmath64 in fig.7 , we show the variation of gw signal generated by bubble wall collisions against temperature as well as the bubble wall velocity .",
    "the plot shows that the intensity is practically independent of the bubble wall velocity .",
    "this behavior can be understood from the @xmath65 dependence of the intensity , as demonstrated by eq.45 .",
    "this feature of velocity independence has been found here in the case of frequency also as we have already mentioned .     and temperature @xmath58 .",
    "]    next , we have compared the gw intensities for the cases of bubble collisions and turbulence for a fixed value of the wall velocity ( @xmath65=0.7 ) and for temperatures above the nucleation temperature @xmath42=0.635 tev , upto temperature near @xmath66=0.91 tev in fig.8 . in the same figure",
    "we have plotted the value of @xmath67 .",
    "the trend of the gw signal from bubble collisions and turbulence follows the variation of the quantity @xmath67 .",
    "as the temperature is lowered from @xmath66 , more and more bubbles are formed which eventually increases the likelihood of more bubble collisions .",
    "thus the intensity of gw increases as the temperature approches @xmath42 .",
    "similarly , as the radii of the bubbles increase with decrease in temperature [ see eq.46 ] the stirring scale @xmath68 of turbulence increases making the motion of the plasma more turbulent and thus the intensity of gw due to turbulence is enhanced .",
    "we also note that the signal from turbulence to be more enhanced than that from bubble collisions . specifically , the value of the peak intensity arising out of turbulence is about @xmath69 whereas that due to bubble collisions is @xmath70 at temperure around @xmath42 .",
    "the calculation shows that the turbulent motion of the plasma was more instrumental in producing gw in the early universe than the bubble collisions .    .",
    "upper plot shows the variation of @xmath67 with temperature @xmath58 . ]    .",
    "upper plot ( dash - dotted line ) shows the variation of @xmath71 with temperature @xmath58 . ]    in fig.9 we have shown the frequency distribution against temperature for gw from turbulence as well as bubble collisions .",
    "we have also plotted the variation of @xmath71 with temperature .",
    "the figure shows that the peak freuencies of gw are essentially proportional to the values of @xmath71 .",
    "the peak frequencies around the region of peak intensities are only fractions of a hertz .",
    "the very low value of gw intensity obtained in our analysis can be understood by noting that the intensity is roughly given by ( see eqs .",
    "45 and 48 ) , @xmath72    in our model , we have got small value of @xmath73 and large value of @xmath74 ( obtained from eqs.50 and 51 ) .",
    "the low value of @xmath75 is because of two reasons ( see eq .",
    "21 ) : ( i ) large number of relativistic species ( = 214 , more than double of the sm value ) present in the plasma and ( ii ) high temperature of the plasma @xmath76 .    on the other hand , the gw frequency",
    "is roughly given by ( see eqs .",
    "37 and 47 ) @xmath77 which explains the value of peak frequency in the decihz range .",
    "the weak gw signals that are obtained in our calculations are difficult to detect in the ongoing gw detectors including ligo . however , there are good possibilities of detection in ultimate decigo [ 28 ] and bbo correlated [ 48 ] , as the sensitivities of these detectors conform to the frequency and intensity range obtained in the present calculation",
    ". these distinct signals of the gravitational waves are characteristic signatures of the high temperture non - standard electroweak phase transition explored [ 36 ] in lht .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied in the present paper some aspects of the dynamics of the bubbles associated with first - order electroweak phase transition within the framework of the littlest higgs model with t parity .",
    "we had earlier , in this model noticed a new region of strong first - order phase transition and proposed a baryogenesis scenario at the tev scale .",
    "our general observation in the present work is that the bubble wall motions are supersonic deflagrated .",
    "it may be noted that the supersonic expansion of symmetric phase bubbles has been considered recently [ 14 ] in a different baryogenesis model .",
    "we have also considered the generation of gravitational waves due to bubble collisions as well as turbulence in the plasma .",
    "as expected , the calculated intensities for the latter case are three order of magnitude larger than for the former case , at their peak values .",
    "although the obtained intensities are quite small in magnitude , we expect them to be detected by some of the future gravitational wave detectors .",
