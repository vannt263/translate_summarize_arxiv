    "the parent compound of colossal magnetoresistive manganites , lamno@xmath0 has drawn a lot of attention because of its various states of spin and orbital order under variation of temperature @xcite .",
    "this compound undergoes a structural phase transition at t@xmath1 = 750 k associated with an orbital order - disorder transition @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that in the low temperature phase the orbital ordering is of c type with alternate arrangement of @xmath7 and @xmath8 orbitals in the @xmath9-plane while the planes are stacked along the @xmath10axis @xcite . on further lowering the temperature lamno@xmath0 undergoes a magnetic transition to an a - type antiferromagnetic phase at the temperature t@xmath11 145 k where the spins are aligned parallel to each other in the @xmath12plane and antiparallel along the @xmath10axis @xcite .    in a recent experiment t. chatterji et al .",
    "@xcite have investigated in detail the jahn - teller transition in lamno@xmath0 using high temperature x - ray and neutron diffraction on powder samples .",
    "they observed that the unit cell volume of lamno@xmath0 decreases with increasing temperature in a narrow temperature range below t@xmath1 and then undergoes a sudden collapse at t@xmath1 .",
    "it was argued that this striking volume collapse is caused by the orbital order - disorder transition . in the orbitally ordered phase the packing of mno@xmath13 octahedra needs more space than in the disordered phase .",
    "the authors compared this unusual phenomenon to the melting of ice which is accompanied by a similar volume collapse .",
    "they also observed that with very small doping of ba the first order like transition becomes second order @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned experimental observation of the volume contraction at the jahn - teller transition temperature in lamno@xmath0 has motivated us to study the effect from a microscopic model for lamno@xmath0 .",
    "in addition to the usual jahn - teller interaction terms we include the coupling between volume strain and the jahn - teller distortions .",
    "this allows us to explain both the observed volume contraction and the first order transitions in the temperature dependence of jahn - teller distortions @xmath14 and @xmath15 within the same context .",
    "in lamno@xmath0  the mn@xmath16 ion in each mno@xmath13 octahedra is in its @xmath17 state , the degenerate @xmath18 orbital is singly occupied and hence jt - active .",
    "the local jt - distortions around each mn@xmath16 ion interact with each other cooperatively and give rise to the observed orbital ordering .",
    "several theoretical investigations have been reported in the past to study the cooperative jt - phenomena in 3d- compounds like mnf@xmath0 , kcuf@xmath0 , lamno@xmath0 and others . among the first few attempts to study such systems",
    "is the approach of kanamori @xcite .",
    "he started from a microscopic hamiltonian with the couplings of jt- electrons to uniform bulk distortions as well as to all vibrational modes . in this model",
    "two possible ordered phases are considered , the ` ferroorbital ' phase where the local distortions together with the orbitals of jt - ions align in the same direction and the the ` antiferroorbital ' case where they align in opposite directions leading to a staggered order .",
    "kanamori s theory was successfully applied to some spinel - type jt - crystals with ferroorbital order to explain the bulk tetragonal distortion and the nature of the structural transition @xcite .",
    "the theory of this type of ordering was further developed by pytte @xcite for more than one jt - ion in an unit cell .",
    "a review of jt phase transitions was given by sturge @xcite in addition it was predicted that the structural phase transition for the antiferro - orbitally ordered state should be of second order even in the presence of higher order terms in the jt- energy and anharmonic terms in the jt distortions @xcite . but the observed phase transitions in most of these antiferroorbitally ordered compounds are in fact first order like .",
    "later on kataoka @xcite showed that for large higher order jt interactions and if both ferro- and antiferro- distortions are taken into account the transition may still be of first order .",
    "we will now use a similar model , supplemented by the effect of the volume strain , to the present case of lamno@xmath0  . as in @xcite",
    ", we start from a microscopic model hamiltonian with the usual first order jt - terms coupling the electronic states to the @xmath19 ( e@xmath3 ) type jt - distortions .",
    "since the fully symmetric @xmath20 ( a@xmath21 ) volume strain can always couple to the square of the jt order parameter , irrespective whether it is of ferro- or antiferro- type , one has to expect a corresponding third order anharmonic term in the lattice energy .",
    "it has two consequences : firstly it induces a spontaneous volume strain q@xmath22 below t@xmath1 as secondary order parameter in addition to the primary staggered jt order parameter q@xmath23 . secondly ,",
    "if the coupling term is large enough compared to the energy of the jt distortion , it can also lead to a first order jt transition .",
    "since in lamno@xmath0  we indeed observe a large volume strain below t@xmath1 and the transition is of first order , despite having a pure staggered order parameter , we conclude that this term which couples volume and jt- strains is more important than the higher order terms in the jt energy itself introduced in @xcite .",
    "our model hamiltonian is then given by    @xmath24    here the first term is the elastic energy of jt distortions with @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the unit cell volume and for the ferro- distortive case @xmath27 are the bulk elastic constants .",
    "thus c@xmath28/@xmath26 = c@xmath29-c@xmath30 is the elastic constant of @xmath19 symmetry distortions ( q@xmath31,q@xmath0 ) . in the ferro- distortive case",
    "they are related to the cartesian elastic strain components @xmath32 by ( @xmath14,@xmath15 ) = 1/@xmath33((e@xmath29 -e@xmath34),1/@xmath35(2e@xmath36-e@xmath34-e@xmath29 ) ) . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ ham1 ] ) represents the first order jt - coupling to the distortions with @xmath37 being the coupling constant .",
    "the third term gives the energy due to volume change where the bulk modulus @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the volume strain given by @xmath40 .",
    "here we assume that @xmath39(t ) = ( v(t)-v@xmath22(t))/v@xmath22(t@xmath1 ) is the dimensionless volume change caused by the jt ordering in addition to the already present backround volume variation of v@xmath22(t ) .",
    "the coupling between volume strain and the jt - distortions is given by the fourth term with a coupling strength @xmath41 .",
    "the last term represents the anharmonic energy due to the volume change .",
    "furthermore @xmath42 and @xmath43 are pseudo spin pauli matrices within the subspace of e@xmath21 states .",
    "the experimental observations @xcite show that the mn - o bond lengths alternate between short and long in the @xmath44-plane and are the same along z - axis which suggests that pure staggered orbital order is realised in lamno@xmath0  without any admixture of ferrodistortion .",
    "the pure staggered order is of c - type corresponding to wave vector q = ( @xmath45,@xmath45,0 ) .",
    "to study this case we divide the lattice into two sublattices a and b and the staggered order requires that distortions in a and b have equal magnitude but opposite signs , i.e. @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) .",
    "we write q@xmath31 and q@xmath0 in polar coordinates as q@xmath31 = q@xmath48 and q@xmath0 = q@xmath49 .",
    "we then have q@xmath50 = -q@xmath51 = q@xmath23 or q@xmath23",

    "the value of the order parameter for which the system has minimum free energy is shown by solid dots for a sequence of temperatures starting at t / t@xmath1 = 0.6 ( deepest minimum on the right side ) increasing in steps of 0.05 to a value of t / t@xmath1 = 1.1 .",

    "there the temperature dependence of jt - distortions is of second order type in the pure anti - ferro orbital order .",
    "therefore the earlier models can not be directly applied to the present case of lamno@xmath0  where one has a first order transition despite having a pure staggered order parameter . > from our calculation",
    "we see that the term which couples volume strain and jt - distortion in the model hamiltonian is also responsible for the sharp collapse of the bulk volume . in the absence of such coupling @xcite , the jt - distortions are volume conserving .",
    "we have not considered the spin degrees of freedom in our model calculation as has been discussed in @xcite and @xcite where it is argued that spin and orbital ordering can interfere with each other through the orbital dependent superexchange interaction .",
    "since the magnetic transition temperature ( t@xmath11 145 k ) in lamno@xmath0  is much lower than the orbital ordering temperature at t@xmath76 750 k , we neglected the effect of spin correlations on the orbital order .",
    "the pronounced volume collapse in lamno@xmath0  at the jt - transition temperature has been studied within a jt pseudospin model .",
    "such models have been used previously to describe structural phase transitions with a jt distorion as order parameter in spinel- type crystals @xcite . to explain the additional volume contraction as secondary order parameter at the orbital order - disorder transition we have supplemented the model with an anharmonic interaction between bulk volume strain and the jt - distortion .",
    "we have studied the evolution from second to first order phase transition as function of the coupling strength and give a realistic parameter set valid for lamno@xmath0  from comparison of the observed t@xmath1 and the associated jump in the jt distortion and the volume collapse .",
    "we also have shown that under suitable change of coupling parameters the transition changes from first to second order which may simulate the observed behaviour under small ba- doping of the crystals ."
