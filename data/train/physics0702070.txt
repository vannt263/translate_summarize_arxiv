    "the bipo detector is dedicated to the measurement of the ultra high radiopurity in @xmath3bi and @xmath0tl of ultra thin materials and especially the double beta source foils of the supernemo detector .",
    "the expected sensitivity is @xmath0tl  @xmath1  2  @xmath2bq / kg and @xmath3bi  @xmath1  10  @xmath2bq / kg .    in order to measure @xmath0tl and @xmath3bi contaminations , the original idea of the bipo detector is to detect the so - called bi - po process , a double detection of an electron followed by a delayed alpha , with organic scintillators .",
    "the @xmath3bi isotope is nearly a pure @xmath6 emitter ( q@xmath7  =  3.27  mev ) decaying into @xmath3po , an @xmath8 emitter with an half - life of 164  @xmath2s .",
    "the @xmath0tl isotope is measured by detecting its parent the @xmath9bi isotope .",
    "@xmath9bi decays with a branching ratio of 64% via a @xmath6 emission in @xmath9po ( q@xmath7  =  2.2  mev ) which is again an @xmath8 emitter with a short half - life of 300  ns .",
    "so , for this two chains a bipo signature is an electron and a delayed @xmath8 with a delay time depending on the isotope contamination we want to measure .",
    "bi and @xmath0tl.,title=\"fig : \" ] bi and @xmath0tl.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "two designs for the bipo detector are under study to find the best compromise between efficiency and background rejection .      the first design , which derives the nemo  3 technology , consists in a tracko - calo planar detector .",
    "the foil to be measured is deposited directly on a horizontal plane of organic plastic scintillator blocks ( 20@xmath1020  cm@xmath5 ) coupled to low radioactive 5  pmts .",
    "a drift wire chamber , working in geiger mode , is installed above the foil .",
    "long plastic scintillator bars , with two sides low activity pmts readout , close the upper part of the wire chamber ( figure [ fig : bipodesigns ] ) . a bipo event from a @xmath9bi decay",
    "is identified as a track of the electron in the wire chamber associated with a hit in time in a scintillator bar and a delayed hit within 1  @xmath2s ( @xmath123@xmath10t@xmath13  ( @xmath9po ) ) in a lower scintillator block near the reconstructed vertex .",
    "the geometrical efficiency is about 25% since it requires the electron going up and the @xmath8 going down .",
    "the bipo events from @xmath3bi decays is identified by a delayed @xmath8 , within 500  @xmath2s ( @xmath123@xmath10t@xmath13  ( @xmath3po ) ) , in the tracking device .",
    "it is however difficult to tag this long delayed @xmath8 by a delay hit in the lower scintillator block because of a probable too high random coincidence level within 500  @xmath2s .",
    "the advantage of the design with a tracking detector is that it allows to measure @xmath3bi and @xmath0tl contaminations from natural radioactive chains with the same device .",
    "however , it requires to build a large gaseous detector and the geometrical efficiency is low .",
    "the second design consists of two thin organic plastic scintillating plates ( 1  cm thick ) with the source foil sandwiched between this plates .",
    "the scintillating plates are polished without any wrapping in order to collect the scintillation light on the lateral sides by total internal reflectivity .",
    "the optical readout is done with low radioactive pmts ( figure [ fig : bipodesigns ] ) .",
    "the position of the emission of scintillation light is reconstructed by the barycenter of the amount of light of each pmt .",
    "an external @xmath14 tagger with plastic scintillators surrounds the detector in order to reject external background .",
    "a bipo event corresponds to a trigger hit in one plate and a delayed hit from the same location in the same plate or in the second one and no hit in time in the @xmath14 tagger .",
    "let s notice that the @xmath3bi measurement will be difficult because of a probable too high random coincidences level within 500  @xmath2s .",
    "this design has the advantage to be compact and to have a large geometrical efficiency .",
    "+     and a delayed @xmath8.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and a delayed @xmath8.,title=\"fig : \" ]      the use of ultra thin scintillating optical fibers between the foil to be measured and the scintillators is a very attractive technique for electrons and alphas identification .",
    "a thickness of 200  @xmath2 m allows both to contain totally and measure @xmath8 particles and to tag electrons without loosing too much energy .",
    "this technique allows to reduce strongly the single rate ( and so the random coincidence ) and to suppress external @xmath14 background .",
    "this technique may be adapted for both previous bipo designs .",
    "the sensitivity of the bipo detector is mostly correlated to the capacity of detecting the @xmath8 emission .",
    "it requires a low energy threshold for @xmath8 detection in order to be sensitive to the whole thickness of the source ( 40  mg/@xmath15 in case of supernemo foils ) .",
    "moreover due to the very large stopping power of @xmath8 particles , the amount of scintillation light produced by an @xmath8 is smaller than the one produced by an electron of the same energy . a scintillation quenching factor",
    "@xmath16 for @xmath8 particles depends on the energy of the @xmath8 and is defined as : @xmath17 the quenching factor , as a function of the energy of the @xmath8 particles , has been measured for the plastic scintillators used in bipo prototype with a dedicated test bench .",
    "@xmath8 particles of 5.5  mev have been produced by an @xmath18am source .",
    "theirs energies have been reduced by pilling up 6  @xmath2 m mylar foils between the source and the scintillator .",
    "a geant  4 simulation of @xmath8 particles emitted by @xmath18am and crossing several foils of mylar has been done in order to determine the expected @xmath8 energy spectrum ( figure  [ fig : alphas ] )",
    ". then the quenching factor has been measured by comparing the observed energy with the one of 1  mev electrons from a @xmath19bi source .",
    "the result is presented in figure  [ fig : alphas ] .",
    "the quenching factor is about 25 for a 1  mev @xmath8 .",
    "it means that the expected energy threshold for electron detection of 40  kev would correspond to an energy threshold for @xmath8 detection of 1  mev .",

    "it is thus function of the thickness of the foil to be measured and the energy threshold of the scintillator .",
    "a geant4 monte carlo of 8.75  mev @xmath8 from @xmath9po decay , emitted randomly in the volume of a @xmath20se foil has been done .",
    "figure  [ fig : alphasefficiency ] shows the probability of these @xmath8 to escape with an energy greater than 1 mev ( 40 kev energy threshold for electron detection ) for different thickness of foil . for a thickness of 40  mg/@xmath15 ( in the case of supernemo foils ) ,",
    "the efficiency is 25% .",
    "this calculation is done with the hypothesis of bulk contamination . the efficiency to tag",
    "surface contamination would be obviously much larger .",
    "the total efficiency of the full bipo detector without tracking device has been calculated with a preliminary geant4 monte carlo .",
    "assuming a thickness of the foil of 40  mg/@xmath15 , an uniform bulk contamination of @xmath9bi in the foil and an energy threshold of 40  kev for electrons ( 1  mev for alpha ) , the total efficiency is 6.5% . with a tracking device ,",
    "the efficiency dropped to 2.5% .",
    "this calculation takes into account rejection of the bipo events in the case of a backscattering of the electron on one scintillator with a deposited energy above the threshold before hitting the second scintillator .",
    "such events with two scintillators in time are rejected as candidate of @xmath9bi contamination in the scintillators ( see below ) .    with a surface of the detection of 10  m@xmath21 ( corresponding to 5  kg of 40  mg/@xmath15 foils to be measured ) , and with 1 month of measurement",
    ", a level of background of 1 count per month would correspond to a sensitivity in @xmath0tl activity of 2  @xmath2bq / kg ( 1@xmath2bq / m@xmath21 ) . in case of the design with a tracking device",
    ", the sensitivity would be 6  @xmath2bq / kg ( 3@xmath2bq / m@xmath21 ) .",
    "the first limitation of the bipo detector is a random coincidence of two scintillation hits within the 1  @xmath2s delay time window .",
    "single counting rate is dominated by compton electron due to external @xmath14 .",
    "it will be strongly reduced either by the tracking detector or by the external @xmath14 tagger depending on the design of the bipo detector .",
    "thickness of scintillators must be also as thin as possible in order to reduce compton electrons .",
    "the use of ultra thin scintillating fiber would also reduce strongly the random coincidence .",
    "one of the objective of prototypes is to demonstrate that the random coincidence will be smaller than 1  count per month for a surface of measurement of 10  m@xmath5 .",
    "the main source of background mimicking a bipo ( electron , delayed alpha ) event is a @xmath9bi surface contamination on the entrance surface of the scintillators block in front of the foil as it is shown in figure  [ fig : bckg ] .",
    "if the deepness of the contamination is small ( typically less than 100  @xmath2mbi beta decay calculated with a geant4 monte carlo is about 50  kev in 100  @xmath2 m of plastic scintillator.[foot : deepness ] ] ) , the electron from the @xmath9bi beta decay will escape the first scintillator and hit the second one without depositing enough energy to trigger the first one .",
    "it will appear exactly like a bipo event emitted from the foil .",
    "however a bulk @xmath9bi contamination inside the block of the scintillators is not a source of background because the emitted electron will fire the scintillators block before escaping and hitting the second one .",
    "the two fired scintillators block will be in time and this background event will be rejected .",
    "the level of surface purity in @xmath9bi of the scintillators required for the bipo detector can not be measured with hpge germanium detectors .",
    "so in order to validate the surface radiopurity of the scintillators and also to validate the technique and the level of random coincidence , prototypes are under construction .          as the technology of the first design is the same as nemo  3 detector , we used it to do some measurements of the @xmath9bi contaminations of the plastic scintillators ( bulk and surface ) . to test the @xmath9bi contamination of the surface",
    "an analysis was done with nemo  3 data .",
    "the analysis channel was a crossing electron in the wire chamber without counter triggered at the beginning of the track and a delayed hit in this scintillator .",
    "the decay spectrum was well fitted corresponding to the 300  ns half - life with a measured activity of 150  @xmath2bq / m@xmath21 .",
    "this value is to much for bipo detector because it corresponds to 400  @xmath2bq / kg for 40  mg/@xmath15 foils .",
    "this result is nt concluding because in nemo  3 the scintillators are wrapped with aluminized mylar for light reflectivity .",
    "our hypothesis is that this contamination comes from the standard aluminum deposited on this mylar .",
    "a bipo prototype is still needed .",
    "the @xmath9bi bulk contamination of the nemo  3 scintillators was measured directly on a nemo  3 counter with an oscilloscope looking for a pmt signal with a delayed hit within 1  @xmath2s .",
    "after 3 days no event has been observed .",
    "it corresponds to an upper limit on the @xmath9bi bulk contamination of the scintillators of a(@xmath9bi )",
    "@xmath1  3  @xmath2bq / kg , in agreement with the bipo requirements .",
    "this preliminary test will be confirmed with the bipo-1 prototype ( see below ) .",
    "two prototypes bipo-1 and bipo-2 are under construction .",
    "the main goal of these prototypes is to measure the level of background : ( i ) the level of random coincidence ; ( ii ) the surface radiopurity of the scintillators .",
    "these two prototypes will be installed in the new canfranc underground laboratory in a shielding test facility .",
    "it consists of a large tight mechanical structure with 10  cm of low active lead ( 20  bq / kg ) and a inner layer of 4  cm of pure iron ( in order to suppress bremsstrahlung from the lead shielding ) .",
    "the inner volume of the shielding is 140@xmath10140@xmath10100  @xmath22 and will be flushed with radon free air .",
    "the first bipo-1 prototype ( figure  [ fig : capsule ] ) , consists of 20 low radioactive capsules made with plexiglas or carbon fibers containing two organic plastic scintillators blocks face - to - face coupled with pmma optical light guide to 5  low radioactive pmts ( hamamatsu r6594 , 0.7  bq / pmt total activity ) .",
    "the size of the scintillator blocks are 20@xmath1020@xmath101  @xmath23 .",
    "their entrance surface is covered with 200  nm of ultra - pure aluminum in order to avoid any scintillation light crosstalk .",
    "the capsules are filled by pure nitrogen in order to suppress radon and thoron contamination .",
    "surface radiopurity in @xmath9bi of the entrance surface of the scintillators is measured by looking for a hit in one pmt and a delayed hit in the second pmt within 2  @xmath2s ( @xmath127@xmath10t@xmath13  ( @xmath9po ) ) without any hit in time ( bulk contamination ) or short delay in within 10  ns ( double compton from external @xmath14 ) .",
    "the large time window allows to distinguish bipo candidates ( up to 1  @xmath2s ) from random coincidence ( flat distribution ) .",
    "acquisition of the full prototype will be done with the matacq acquisition board , a very high dynamic range and high sampling rate vme digitizing adc board .",

    "the single counting rate was 0.3  hz with an energy threshold of 60 kev .",
