    "the basics of the density matrix renormalization group were developed by s. white in 1992@xcite and since then dmrg has proved to be a very powerful method for low dimensional interacting systems . its remarkable accuracy can be seen for example in the spin-1 heisenberg chain : for a system of hundreds of sites a precision of @xmath0 for the ground state energy can be achieved . since then it has been applied to a great variety of systems and problems ( principally in one dimension ) including , among others , spin chains , fermionic and bosonic systems , disordered models , impurities , etc .",
    "it has also been improved substantially in several directions like two dimensional ( 2d ) classical systems , phonons , molecules , the inclusion of temperature and the calculation of dynamical properties .",
    "some calculations have also been performed in 2d quantum systems .",
    "all these topics are treated in detail and in a pedagogical way in a book published recently , where the reader can find an extensive review on dmrg@xcite .    in this article",
    "we will attempt to cover the different areas where it has been applied .",
    "regretfully , however , we wo nt be able to review the large number of papers that have been written using different aspects of this very efficient method .",
    "we have chosen what , in our opinion , are the most representative contributions and we suggest the interested reader to look for further information in these references . our aim here is to give the reader a general overview on the subject .",
    "one of the most important limitations of numerical calculations in finite systems is the great amount of states that have to be considered and its exponential growth with system size .",
    "several methods have been introduced in order to reduce the size of the hilbert space to be able to reach larger systems , such as monte carlo , renormalization group ( rg ) and dmrg .",
    "each method considers a particular criterion to keep the relevant information .",
    "the dmrg was originally developed to overcome the problems that arise in interacting systems in 1d when standard rg procedures were applied .",
    "consider a block b ( a block is a collection of sites ) where the hamiltonian @xmath1 and end - operators are defined .",
    "these traditional methods consist in putting together two or more blocks ( e.g. b - b , which we will call the superblock ) , connected using end - operators , in a basis that is a direct product of the basis of each block , forming @xmath2 .",
    "this hamiltonian is then diagonalized , the superblock is replaced by a new effective block @xmath3 formed by a certain number @xmath4 of lowest - lying eigenstates of @xmath2 and the iteration is continued ( see ref .",
    "although it has been used successfully in certain cases , this procedure , or similar versions of it , has been applied to several interacting systems with poor performance .",
    "for example , it has been applied to the 1d hubbard model keeping @xmath5 states . for 16 sites , an error of 5 - 10%",
    "was obtained @xcite .",
    "other results@xcite were also discouraging .",
    "a better performance was obtained @xcite by adding a single site at a time rather than doubling the block size .",
    "however , there is one case where a similar version of this method applies very well : the kondo model .",
    "wilson@xcite mapped the one - impurity problem onto a one - dimensional lattice with exponentially descreasing hoppings .",
    "the difference with the method explained above is that in this case , one site ( equivalent to an  onion shell \" ) is added at each step and , due to the exponential decrease of the hopping , very accurate results can be obtained .",
    "returning to the problem of putting several blocks together , the main source of error comes from the election of eigenstates of @xmath2 as representative states of a superblock .",
    "since @xmath2 has no connection to the rest of the lattice , its eigenstates may have unwanted features ( like nodes ) at the ends of the block and this ca nt be improved by increasing the number of states kept .",
    "based on this consideration , noack and white@xcite tried including different boundary conditions and boundary strengths .",
    "this turned out to work well for single particle and anderson localization problems but , however , it did not improve significantly results in interacting systems .",
    "these considerations lead to the idea of taking a larger superblock that includes the blocks @xmath6 , diagonalize the hamiltonian in this large superblock and then somehow project the most favorable states onto @xmath6 .",
    "then @xmath6 is replaced by @xmath3 . in this way ,",
    "awkward features in the boundary would vanish and a better representation of the states in the infinite system would be achieved .",
    "white@xcite proposed the density matrix as the optimal way of projecting the best states onto part of the system and this will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the justification of using the density matrix is given in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "a very easy and pedagogical way of understanding the basic functioning of dmrg is applying it to the calculation of simple quantum problems like one particle in a tight binding chain @xcite .    in the following section",
    "we will briefly describe the standard method ; in sect .",
    "3 we will mention some of the most important applications ; in sect .",
    "4 we review the most relevant extensions to the method and finally in sect .",
    "5 we concentrate on the way dynamical calculations can be performed within dmrg .",
    "the dmrg allows for a systematic truncation of the hilbert space by keeping the most probable states describing a wave function ( _ e.g .  _",
    "the ground state ) instead of the lowest energy states usually kept in previous real space renormalization techniques .",
    "the basic idea consists in starting from a small system ( _ e.g _ with @xmath7 sites ) and then gradually increase its size ( to @xmath8 , @xmath9 , ... ) until the desired length is reached .",
    "let us call the collection of @xmath7 sites the _ universe _ and divide it into two parts : the _ system _ and the _ environment _ ( see fig .",
    "[ figsuperblock ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian is constructed in the _ universe _ and its ground state @xmath10 is obtained .",
    "this is considered as the state of the _ universe _ and called the _",
    "target state_. it has components on the _ system _ and the _ envorinment_. we want to obtain the most relevant states of the _ system _ , i.e. , the states of the _ system _ that have largest weight in @xmath11 . to obtain this ,",
    "the _ environment _ is considered as a statistical bath and the density matrix@xcite is used to obtain the desired information on the _",
    "system_. so instead of keeping eigenstates of the hamiltonian in the block ( _ system _ ) , we keep eigenstates of the density matrix . we will be more explicit below .",
    "= 2.0 in = 1.0 in    let s define block [ * b * ] as a finite chain with @xmath12 sites , having an associated hilbert space with @xmath4 states where operators are defined ( in particular the hamiltonian in this finite chain , @xmath1 and the operators at the ends of the block , useful for linking it to other chains or added sites ) .",
    "except for the first iteration , the basis in this block is nt explicitly known due to previous basis rotations and reductions .",
    "the operators in this basis are matrices and the basis states are characterized by quantum numbers ( like @xmath13 , charge or number of particles , etc ) .",
    "we also define an added block or site as [ * a * ] having @xmath14 states .",
    "a general iteration of the method consists of :    \\i ) define the hamiltonian @xmath2 for the superblock ( the _ universe _ ) formed by putting together two blocks [ * b * ] and [ * b * ] and two added sites [ * a * ] and [ * a * ] in this way : [ * b a a b * ] ( the primes are only to indicate additional blocks , but the primed blocks have the same structure as the non - primed ones ; this can vary , see the finite size algorithm below ) . in general , blocks",
    "[ * b * ] and [ * b * ] come from the previous iteration .",
    "the total hilbert space of this superblock is the direct product of the individual spaces corresponding to each block and the added sites . in practice",
    "a quantum number of the superblock can be fixed ( in a spin chain for example one can look at the total @xmath15 subspace ) , so the total number of states in the superblock is much smaller than @xmath16 . as , in some cases , the quantum number of the superblock consists of the sum of the quantum numbers of the individual blocks , each one must contain several subspaces ( several values of @xmath13 for example ) .    here",
    "periodic boundary conditions can be attached to the ends and a different block layout should be considered ( e.g. [ * b a b a * ] ) to avoid connecting blocks [ * b * ] and [ * b * ] which takes longer to converge .",
    "the boundary conditions are between [ * a * ] and [ * b * ] . for closed chains",
    "the performance is poorer than for open boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "\\ii ) diagonalize the hamiltonian @xmath2 to obtain the ground state @xmath11 ( target state ) using lanczos@xcite or davidson@xcite algorithms .",
    "other states could also be kept , such as the first excited ones : they are all called target states .",
    "\\iii ) construct the density matrix : @xmath17 on block [ * b a * ] , where @xmath18 , the states @xmath19 belonging to the hilbert space of the block [ * b a * ] and the states @xmath20 to the block [ * b a * ] .",
    "the density matrix considers the part [ * b a * ] as a system and [ * b a * ] , as a statistical bath .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath21 with the highest eigenvalues correspond to the most probable states ( or equivalently the states with highest weight ) of block [ * b a * ] in the ground state of the whole superblock .",
    "these states are kept up to a certain cutoff , keeping a total of @xmath4 states per block .",
    "the density matrix eigenvalues sum up to unity and the truncation error , defined as the sum of the density matrix eigenvalues corresponding to discarded eigenvectors , gives a qualitative indication of the accuracy of the calculation .",
    "\\iv ) with these @xmath4 states a rectangular matrix @xmath22 is formed and it is used to change basis and reduce all operators defined in [ * b a * ] .",
    "this block [ * b a * ] is then renamed as block [ * b@xmath23 * ] or simply [ * b * ] ( for example , the hamiltonian in block [ * b a * ] , @xmath24 , is transformed into @xmath25 as @xmath26 ) .",
    "\\v ) a new block [ * a * ] is added ( one site in our case ) and the new superblock [ * b a a b * ] is formed as the direct product of the states of all the blocks .",
    "\\vi ) this iteration continues until the desired length is achieved . at each step",
    "the length is @xmath27 ( if [ * a * ] consists of one site ) .    when more than one target state is used , _",
    "i.e _ more than one state is wished to be well described , the density matrix is defined as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 defines the probability of finding the system in the target state @xmath30 ( not necessarily eigenstates of the hamiltonian ) .",
    "the method described above is usually called the _ infinite system algorithm _ since the system size increases in two lattice sites ( if the added block [ * a * ] has one site ) at each iteration .",
    "there is a way to increase precision at each length @xmath7 called the _ finite system algorithm_. it consists of fixing the lattice size and zipping a couple of times until convergence is reached . in this case and for the block configuration [",
    "* b a a b * ] , @xmath31 where @xmath12 and @xmath32 are the number of sites in @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively . in this step",

    "should be defined in @xmath36 sites such that @xmath37 .",
    "the operators in this smaller block should be kept from previous iterations ( in some cases from the iterations for the system size with @xmath38)@xcite .",
    "the calculation of static properties like correlation functions is easily done by keeping the operators in question at each step and performing the corresponding basis change and reduction , in a similar manner as done with the hamiltonian in each block@xcite .",
    "the energy and measurements are calculated in the superblock .",
    "a faster convergence of lanczos or davidson algorithm is achieved by choosing a good trial vector@xcite .",
    "an interesting analysis on dmrg accuracy is done in ref .",
    "fixed points of the dmrg and their relation to matrix product wave functions were studied in @xcite and an analytic formulation combining the block renormalization group with variational and fokker - planck methods in @xcite .",
    "the connection of the method with quantum groups and conformal field theory is treated in @xcite .",

    "since its development , the number of papers using dmrg has grown enormously and other improvements to the method have been performed .",
    "we would like to mention some applications where this method has proved to be useful .",
    "other applications related to further developments of the dmrg will be mentioned in sect .",
    "a very impressive result with unprecedented accuracy was obtained by white and huse @xcite when calculating the spin gap in a @xmath39 heisenberg chain obtaining @xmath40 .",
    "they also calculated very accurate spin correlation functions and excitation energies for one and several magnon states and performed a very detailed analysis of the excitations for different momenta .",
    "they obtained a spin correlation length of 6.03 lattice spacings .",
    "simultaneously srensen and affleck@xcite also calculated the structure factor and spin gap for this system up to length 100 with very high accuracy , comparing their results with the nonlinear @xmath41 model .",
    "in a subsequent paper@xcite they applied the dmrg to the anisotropic @xmath39 chain , obtaining the values for the haldane gap .",
    "they also performed a detailed study of the @xmath42 end excitations in an open chain .",
    "thermodynamic properties in open @xmath39 chains such as specific heat , electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) and magnetic susceptibility calculated using dmrg gave an excellent fit to experimental data , confirming the existence of free spins 1/2 at the boundaries@xcite .",
    "a related problem , _",
    "i.e. _ the effect of non - magnetic impurities in spin systems ( dimerized , ladders and 2d ) was studied in @xcite .    for larger integer spins",
    "there have also been some studies .",
    "nishiyama and coworkers@xcite calculated the low energy spectrum and correlation functions of the @xmath43 antiferromagnetic heisenberg open chain .",
    "they found @xmath39 end excitations ( in agreement with the valence bond theory ) .",
    "edge excitations for other values of @xmath44 have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . almost at the same time",
    "schollwck and jolicoeur@xcite calculated the spin gap in the same system , up to 350 sites , ( @xmath45 ) , correlation functions that showed topological order and a spin correlation length of 49 lattice spacings .",
    "more recent accurate studies of @xmath43 chains are found in @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the dispersion of the single magnon band and other properties of the @xmath43 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chains were calculated .",
    "concerning @xmath42 systems , dmrg has been crucial for obtaining the logarithmic corrections to the @xmath46 dependence of the spin - spin correlation functions in the isotropic heisenberg model @xcite . for this , very accurate values for the energy and correlation functions were needed . for @xmath47 sites",
    "an error of @xmath48 was achieved keeping @xmath49 states per block , comparing with the exact finite - size bethe ansatz results .",
    "for this model it was found that the data for the correlation function has a very accurate scaling behaviour and advantage of this was taken to obtain the logarithmic corrections in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "other calculations of the spin correlations have been performed for the anisotropic case @xcite .",
    "similar calculations have been performed for the @xmath50 heisenberg chain @xcite . in this case",
    "a stronger logarithmic correction to the spin correlation function was found .",
    "for this model there was interest in obtaining the central charge @xmath51 to elucidate whether this model corresponds to the same universality class as the @xmath42 case , where the central charge can be obtained from the finite - size scaling of the energy .",
    "although there have been previous attempts@xcite , these calculations presented difficulties since they involved also a term @xmath52 . with the dmrg",
    "the value @xmath53 was clearly obtained .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , dmrg was applied to an effective spin hamiltonian obtained from an su(4 ) spin - orbit critical state in 1d . another application to enlarged symmetry cases ( su(4 ) )",

    "there have been several extensions to dmrg like the inclusion of symmetries to the method such as spin and parity@xcite .",
    "total spin conservation and continuous symmetries have been treated in @xcite and in interaction - round a face hamiltonians@xcite , a formulation that can be applied to rotational - invariant sytems like @xmath39 and 2 chains@xcite .",
    "a momentum representation of this technique @xcite that allows for a diagonalization in a fixed momentum subspace has been developed as well as applications in dimension higher than one@xcite and bethe lattices@xcite .",
    "the inclusion of symmetries is essential to the method since it allows to consider a smaller number of states , enhance precision and obtain eigenstates with a definite quantum number .",
    "other recent applications have been in nuclear shell model calculations where a two level pairing model has been considered@xcite and in the study of ultrasmall superconducting grains , in this case , using the particle ( hole ) states around the fermi level as the system ( environment ) block@xcite .",
    "a very interesting and successful application is a recent work in high energy physics@xcite . here",
    "the dmrg is used in an asymptotically free model with bound states , a toy model for quantum chromodynamics , namely the two dimensional delta - function potential . for this case",
    "an algorithm similar to the momentum space dmrg@xcite was used where the block and environment consist of low and high energy states respectively .",
    "the results obtained here are much more accurate than the similarity renormalization group@xcite and a generalization to field - theoretical models is proposed based on the discreet light - cone quantization in momentum space@xcite .",
    "below we briefly mention other important extensions , leaving the calculation of dynamical properties for the next section .",
    "the dmrg has been very successfully extended to study classical systems . for a detailed description",
    "we refer the reader to ref . @xcite .",
    "since 1d quantum systems are related to 2d classical systems@xcite , it is natural to adapt dmrg to the classical 2d case .",
    "this method is based on the renormalization group transformation for the transfer matrix @xmath56 .",
    "it is a variational method that maximizes the partition function using a limited number of degrees of freedom , where the variational state is written as a product of local matrices@xcite . for 2d classical systems ,",
    "this algorithm is superior to the classical monte carlo method in accuracy , speed and in the possibility of treating much larger systems .",
    "a further improvement to this method is based on the corner transfer matrix@xcite , the ctmrg@xcite and can be generalized to any dimension@xcite .",
    "it was first applied to the ising model@xcite and also to the potts model@xcite , where very accurate density profiles and critical indices were calculated .",
    "further applications have included non - hermitian problems in equilibrium and non - equilibrium physics . in the first case ,",
    "transfer matrices may be non - hermitian and several situations have been considered : a model for the quantum hall effect@xcite and the @xmath57-symmetric heisenberg chain related to the conformal series of critical models@xcite . in the second case , the adaptation of the dmrg to non - equilibrium physics like the asymmetric exclusion problem@xcite and reaction - diffusion problems @xcite has shown to be very successful .",
    "the adaptation of the dmrg method for classical systems paved the way for the study of 1d quantum systems at non zero temperature , by using the trotter - suzuki method @xcite . in this case",
    "the system is infinite and the finiteness is in the level of the trotter approximation .",
    "standard dmrg usually produces its best results for the ground state energy and less accurate results for higher excitations .",
    "a different situation occurs here : the lower the temperature , the less accurate the results .",
    "very nice results have been obtained for the dimerized , @xmath42 , xy model , where the specific heat was calculated involving an extremely small basis set@xcite ( @xmath58 ) , the agreement with the exact solution being much better in the case where the system has a substantial gap .",
    "it has also been used to calculate thermodynamic properties of the anisotropic @xmath42 heisenberg model , with relative errors for the spin susceptibility of less than @xmath59 down to temperatures of the order of @xmath60 keeping @xmath61 states@xcite . a complete study of thermodynamic properties like magnetization , susceptibility , specific",

    "they also calculated low temperature thermodynamic properties of the 1d kondo lattice model@xcite and zhang et al.@xcite applied the same method in the study of a magnetic impurity embedded in a quantum spin chain .",
    "a significant limitation to the dmrg method is that it requires a finite basis and calculations in problems with infinite degrees of freedom per site require a large truncation of the basis states@xcite .",
    "however , jeckelmann and white developed a way of including phonons in dmrg calculations by transforming each boson site into several artificial interacting two - state pseudo - sites and then applying dmrg to this interacting system@xcite ( called the  pseudo - site system \" ) .",
    "the idea is based on the fact that dmrg is much better able to handle several few - states sites than few many - state sites@xcite .",
    "the key idea is to substitute each boson site with @xmath65 states into @xmath7 pseudo - sites with 2 states@xcite .",
    "they applied this method to the holstein model for several hundred sites ( keeping more than a hundred states per phonon mode ) obtaining negligible error .",
    "in addition , up to date , this method is the most accurate one to determine the ground state energy of the polaron problem ( holstein model with a single electron ) .",
    "an alternative method ( the  optimal phonon basis\")@xcite is a procedure for generating a controlled truncation of a large hilbert space , which allows the use of a very small optimal basis without significant loss of accuracy .",
    "the system here consists of only one site and the environment has several sites , both having electronic and phononic degrees of freedom .",
    "the density matrix is used to trace out the degrees of freedom of the environment and extract the most relevant states of the site in question . in following steps , more bare phonons",
    "are included to the optimal basis obtained in this way .",
    "a variant of this scheme is the  four block method \" , as described in @xcite .",
    "they obtain very accurately the luttinger liquid - cdw insulator transition in the 1d hostein model for spinless fermions .",
    "the method has also been applied to pure bosonic systems such as the disordered bosonic hubbard model@xcite , where gaps , correlation functions and superfluid density are obtained .",
    "the phase diagram for the non - disordered bose - hubbard model , showing a reentrance of the superfluid phase into the insulating phase was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite    the dmrg has been also been generalized to 1d random systems , and applied to the random antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic heisenberg chains@xcite , including quasiperiodic exchange modulation@xcite and a detailed study of the haldane phase in these systems@xcite .",

    "recent attempts to apply dmrg to the _ ab initio _ calculation of electronic states in molecules have been successful@xcite . here , dmrg is applied within the conventional quantum chemical framework of a finite basis set with non - orthogonal basis functions centered on each atom .",
    "after the standard hartree - fock ( hf ) calculation in which a hamiltonian is produced within the orthogonal hf basis , dmrg is used to include correlations beyond hf , where each orbital is treated as a  site \" in a 1d lattice .",
    "one important difference with standard dmrg is that , as the interactions are long ranged , several operators must be kept , making the calculation somewhat cumbersome .",
    "however , very accurate results have been obtained in a check performed in a water molecule ( keeping up to 25 orbitals and @xmath66 states per block ) , obtaining an offset of 0.00024hartrees with respect to the exact ground state energy@xcite , a better performance than any other approximate method@xcite .    in order to avoid the non - locality introduced in the treatment explained above",

    "this value of @xmath57 is not defined we took the nearest value .",
    "= 3.3 in = 2.75 in    even though we are including states with a given momentum as target states , due to the particular real - space construction of the reduced hilbert space , this translational symmetry is not fulfilled and the momentum is not fixed . to check how the reduction on the hilbert space influences the momentum @xmath57 of the target state @xmath110 , we calculated the expectation values @xmath111 for all @xmath112 .",

    "we can see here that the momentum is better defined , even for much larger systems , but , as expected , more weight on other @xmath112 values arises for larger @xmath7 .    as a check of the approximation we calculated the sum rule @xmath118 for @xmath107 , 5 target states and @xmath100 .",
    "we obtain a relative error of 0.86% .",
    "recently , important improvements to this method have been published @xcite : by considering the finite system method in open chains , khner and white obtained a higher precision in dynamical responses of spin chains . in order to define a momentum in an open chain and to avoid end effects ,",
    "they introduce a filter function with weight centered in the middle of the chain and zero at the boundaries .    in this section",
    "we presented a method of calculating dynamical responses with dmrg .",
    "although the basis truncation is big , this method keeps only the most relevant states and , for example , even by considering a @xmath119 of the total hilbert space ( for @xmath107 only @xmath120 40000 states are kept ) a reasonable description of the low energy excitations is obtained .",
    "we show that it is also possible to obtain states with well defined momenta if the appropriate target states are used .      introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite in the dmrg context and improved in ref .",
    "@xcite , this method focuses on a particular energy or energy window , allowing a more precise description in that range and the possibility of calculating spectra for higher energies . instead of using the tridiagonalization of the hamiltonian , but in a similar spirit regarding the important target states to be kept , the spectrum can be calculated for a given @xmath121 by using a correction vector ( related to the operator @xmath70 that can depend on momentum @xmath57 ) .",
    "following ( [ eq : din ] ) , the ( complex ) correction vector @xmath122 can be defined as : @xmath123 so the green s function can be calculated as @xmath124    separating the correction vector in real and imaginary parts @xmath125 we obtain @xmath126 and @xmath127    the former equation is solved using the conjugate gradient method .    in order to keep the information of the excitations at this particular energy the following states are targeted in the dmrg iterations : the ground state @xmath128 , the first lanczos vector @xmath129 and the correction vector @xmath122 . even though only a certain energy is focused on",
    ", dmrg gives the correct excitations for an energy range surrounding this particular point so that by running several times for nearby frequencies , an approximate spectrum can be obtained for a wider region @xcite .",
    "this method@xcite relies on a moment expansion of the dynamical correlations using sum rules that depend only on static correlation functions which can be calculated with dmrg . with these moments",
    ", the green s functions can be calculated using the maximum entropy method .",
    "the first step is the calculation of sum rules . as an example , and following @xcite , the spin - spin correlation function @xmath130 of the heisenberg model is calculated where the operator @xmath70 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ca ] ) is @xmath131 and the sum rules are@xcite : @xmath132,s^z(-q ) ] \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 2[1-\\cos(q)]\\sum_i\\langle s^+_{i}s^-_{i+1}+s^-_{i}s^+_{i+1}\\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath133 is the static susceptibility .",
    "these sum rules can be easily generalized to higher moments : @xmath134 ... ],s^z(-q)]\\rangle \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath12 odd .",
    "a similar expression is obtained for @xmath12 even , where the outer square bracket is replaced by an anticommutator and the total sign is changed . here",
    "@xmath75 appears in the commutator @xmath135 times .",
    "apart from the first moment which is given by the static susceptibility , all the other moments can be expressed as equal time correlations ( using a symbolic manipulator ) .",
    "the static susceptibility @xmath136 is calculated by applying a small field @xmath137 and calculating the density response @xmath138 with dmrg .",
    "then @xmath139 for @xmath140 .",
    "these moments are calculated for several chain lengths and extrapolated to the infinite system .",
    "once the moments are calculated , the final spectra is constructed via the maximum entropy method ( me ) , which has become a standard way to extract maximum information from incomplete data ( for details see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "reasonable spectra are obtained for the xy and isotropic models , although information about the exact position of the gaps has to be included .",
    "otherwise , the spectra are only qualitatively correct .",
    "this method requires the calculation of a large amount of moments in order to get good results : the more information given to the me equations , the better the result .      in order to include temperature in the calculation of dynamical quantities , the transfer matrix rg described above ( tmrg@xcite )",
    "was extended to obtain imaginary time correlation functions@xcite .",
    "after fourier transformation in the imaginary time axis , analytic continuation from imaginary to real frequencies is done using maximum entropy ( me ) .",
    "the combination of the tmrg and me is free from statistical errors and the negative sign problem of monte carlo methods .",
    "since we are dealing with the transfer matrix , the thermodynamic limit can be discussed directly without extrapolations .",
    "however , in the present scheme , only local quantities can be calculated .",
    "a systematic investigation of local spectral functions is done in ref .",
    "@xcite for the anisotropic heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain .",
    "they obtain good qualitative results especially for high temperatures but a quantitative description of peaks and gaps are beyond the method , due to the severe intrinsic limitation of the analytic continuation .",
    "this method was also applied with great success to the 1d kondo insulator@xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the local density of states and local dynamic spin and charge correlation functions was calculated .",
    "we have presented here a very brief description of the density matrix renormalization group technique , its applications and extensions .",
    "the aim of this article is to give the unexperienced reader an idea of the possibilities and scope of this powerful , though relatively simple , method .",

    "<S> the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) has become a powerful numerical method that can be applied to low - dimensional strongly correlated fermionic and bosonic systems . </S>",
    "<S> it allows for a very precise calculation of static , dynamic and thermodynamic properties . </S>",
    "<S> its field of applicability has now extended beyond condensed matter , and is successfully used in statistical mechanics and high energy physics as well . in this article , we briefly review the main aspects of the method . we also comment on some of the most relevant applications so as to give an overview on the scope and possibilities of dmrg and mention the most important extensions of the method such as the calculation of dynamical properties , the application to classical systems , inclusion of temperature , phonons and disorder and a recent modification for the _ ab initio _ calculation of electronic states in molecules .    </S>"
