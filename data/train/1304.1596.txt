    "the key idea is to look at the evolution over a time step , @xmath110 , as the integral @xmath111 which can be approximated using a runge - kutta method ( see cox - matthews @xcite ) as @xmath112 n ( u_m , n_m , f ( t_m ) ) + \\right .",

    ", we are able to locate stable equilibrium solutions for @xmath34 sufficiently large with respect to @xmath106 in several cases . then , this equilibrium solution can be fed into a nonlinear continuation method such as _ auto _ or the adjoint continuation method of @xcite to begin solving with particular values of @xmath106 , @xmath34 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "to begin , in an attempt to model the non - trivial dynamics in the zakharov system , we follow some of the ideas in @xcite to analyze a series of numerically integrated solutions of . in our numerical experiments we observe a great deal of energy exchange between the schrdinger and dirac solutions , hence we will focus on relatively small energy initial data in order to justify that our numerics are valid on long time scales . if the fourier modes become too large at the edges of the spectrum , we do not consider the solution to be appropriately accurate , hence all simulations included here will have small contributions at high frequency .",
    "the time scale on which we integrate is generally @xmath118 with the time step @xmath119 . for the forward solver",
    ", we will begin by taking @xmath120 fourier modes on which to evolve .",
    "in addition , our contour integrals in the numerical evaluation of @xmath121 will be taken as a mean of 64 equidistributed points along the disc .    for a range of @xmath106 , given @xmath34",
    "sufficiently large , we observe that the dynamics tend to a fixed equilibrium solution as in section [ s : trivialattractor ] . however , for @xmath34 much smaller ( or @xmath106 large ) , we observe much richer dynamics in the phase space , particularly in the form of periodic orbits , multiple equilibrium solutions , and period doubling bifurcations .",
    "though our auto solutions are pseudospectral in nature , the orbits we find are still stable under forward integration over many periods and are in that sense quite numerically stable .",
    "to observe the changes in behavior as we vary @xmath34 from the case of the trivial attractor , we use two different nonlinear continuation methods , namely we use _ auto _ , @xcite , and the adjoint - continuation method ( acm ) of ambrose - wilkening from @xcite .",

    "<S> the zakharov system was originally proposed to study the propagation of langmuir waves in an ionized plasma . in this paper , motivated by the work of the first and third authors in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we numerically and analytically investigate the dynamics of the dissipative zakharov system on the torus in @xmath0 dimension . </S>",
    "<S> we find an interesting family of stable periodic orbits and fixed points , and explore bifurcations of those points as we take weaker and weaker dissipation . </S>"
