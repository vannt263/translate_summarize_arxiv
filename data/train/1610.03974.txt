    "all investigated amorphous solids show quite universal low temperature anomalies of the acoustic , dielectric and thermal properties . although most of these anomalies can be explained within either the phenomenological tunneling or soft potential model , their microscopic origin is not yet cleared up .",
    "surprisingly , a glassy - like behavior was also observed in some crystalline solids at low temperatures  @xcite . in some plastically deformed crystals ( al , ta , and",
    "nb ) the intrinsic properties of linear defects ( dislocations ) were found to be of importance  @xcite .",
    "however , the analysis shows that this picture is not universal .",
    "for example it is not appropriate for the description of observed glass - like anomalies in @xmath0 alloys .",
    "one of the physically interesting solids is a stabilized cubic zirconium dioxide  @xcite . in experiments with",
    "a ca stabilized zro@xmath1 single crystal we found together with a typical glassy behavior of the low temperature properties ( like the thermal conductivity , heat capacity , ultra sound velocity and internal friction ) a _ giant heat release _ , which exceeds typical values for amorphous and other glass - like crystalline solids by roughly two orders of magnitude .",
    "the analysis of these data shows that the giant heat release is caused by tunneling systems with extremely large barrier heights .",
    "an interesting question is why the relaxation time of these tunneling systems is so short that they can contribute to the heat release in a time scale of minutes ?",
    "unfortunately , any theoretical attempts to explain this phenomenon are failed .",
    "the reason is that the giant heat release depends on many factors such as the maximum barrier height of the distribution , a zero point energy of tunneling systems , cooling rates , and the thermal expansion of the material .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on a study of the low - temperature behavior of nbti  @xcite . ti atoms in nbti act like traps for atomic hydrogen ( h ) or deuterium ( d ) .",
    "it seems that at low temperatures h or d atoms can change their positions near ti atoms by a tunneling process thereby causing typical for structural glasses anomalies in the heat capacity @xcite or in the long - time heat release @xcite .",
    "since the hydrogen in a given nbti sample can be easily replaced by deuterium , we are permitted to investigate the influence of the mass of tunneling atoms on the low temperature anomalies , which is impossible for structural glasses .",
    "therefore we have measured the thermal conductivity , heat capacity and heat release of nbti with nearly the same concentration of h or d.    an additional problem is that the internal friction of pure polycrystalline nb@xmath2ti@xmath3 with 0.2 @xmath4 0.6 also shows low temperature anomalies typical for structural glasses @xcite . actually , our measurements of pure nb@xmath5ti@xmath6 reveal evidence of a glassy behavior for other main thermal characteristics .",
    "thus , additional tunneling states are caused by atoms in the matrix .",
    "these tunneling systems are originated from local phase fluctuations between the @xmath7 - and @xmath8 - phases , which are close in their energy @xcite .",
    "however , investigations of the crystal structure of nbti show that a small amount of hydrogen leads to a thermally and mechanically stable single @xmath7 - phase structure @xcite and we _ can assume _ that these additional tunneling states disappear above some critical concentration of h or d.",
    "let us start from some useful theoretical background .",
    "the experimental data will be analyzed within the standard tunneling model ( stm )  @xcite which is based on the assumption that there exist two - level systems ( tlss ) with a constant distribution of their asymmetry energy @xmath9 and tunneling parameter @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a so - called `` spectral density '' .",
    "for the thermal conductivity , @xmath13 , stm yields @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mass density , @xmath16 are the coupling constants between tlss and phonons , and @xmath17 are the sound velocities of the longitudinal and transversal sound waves .",
    "as is seen , the thermal conductivity is very sensitive to magnitudes of the coupling constants .    on the contrary",
    ", the specific heat depends quite weakly on the coupling constants .",
    "this fact allows one to extract @xmath18 from experiment ( here and below we use notation @xmath18 for the parameter @xmath12 when it was extracted from the heat capacity measurements ) .",
    "explicitly , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a characteristic time of the heat capacity measurement and @xmath21 is the minimum relaxation time .",
    "@xmath21 can be estimated from the general expression for the relaxation time @xmath22 of a tunneling process @xmath23^{-1}\\ ] ] with @xmath24 and @xmath25 on conditions that @xmath26 .",
    "the long - time heat release is of our main interest here because it is most sensitive to the expected isotopic effect . after a rapid cooling of a sample from some initial ( equilibrium ) temperature @xmath27 to a final ( phonon ) temperature @xmath28 , the tunneling systems with relaxation time @xmath22 longer than the time necessary for cooling remain in a non - equilibrium state .",
    "their further relaxation to a new equilibrium state leads to an energy transfer from tunneling systems to phonons  @xcite @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the tunneling parameter extracted from the heat release measurements , @xmath32 is the volume of the sample , and the freezing temperature @xmath33 is given by  @xcite @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the effective barrier height of tls causing the heat release at given time @xmath20 , @xmath36 is the cooling rate at the freezing temperature @xmath33 , and @xmath37 is the constant of the thermal activation rate .",
    "the saturation of the heat release above @xmath33 is a consequence of the thermal activation process which dominates at high enough temperatures .",
    "the relaxation time at higher temperatures becomes so short that tlss with given @xmath35 and higher energies @xmath38 reach the equilibrium during the cooling process and do not contribute to the heat release .    obviously , within the stm @xmath39 .",
    "numerical calculations show that 95% of the heat release observed at fixed time @xmath20 is produced by tunneling systems whose relaxation times lie in the range of @xmath40 .",
    "these tlss are located in a quite small region of the distribution function @xmath41 with @xmath42 for a typical time of the heat release experiments @xmath43h and @xmath10 varying between 15 and 20 .",
    "for instance , in structural glasses this range amounts to about 20% of the effective tunneling parameter @xmath44 determined by the equation @xmath45 .",
    "thus , all tlss causing the heat release at time @xmath20 are contained in a small range of @xmath41 around @xmath46 . if we replace h by d and measure the heat release at the same time @xmath20 we observe the heat release of tlss with equal @xmath46 .",
    "the relation between @xmath44 and @xmath35 is given by @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a distance between potential minima and @xmath49 is the mass of tunneling atoms .",
    "therefore , if we replace h by d and assume that the distribution of tlss is completely determined by nbti matrix , the heat release at the same time @xmath20 will be caused by tlss with markedly smaller barrier heights .",
    "indeed , at equal @xmath10 one obtains @xmath50 as long as @xmath51 . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) this results in a large isotopic effect in the freezing temperatures @xmath52    in addition , the distribution parameter should also be changed . from eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) follows @xmath53 since the places of d and h and the barrier heights between them are determined by the lattice of nbti ( i.e. @xmath54 and we expect for equal concentrations the same number of tlss ( @xmath55 ) , which is proportional to @xmath56 .",
    "thus we expect a drastic change in the maximum value of the heat release @xmath57\\approx\\left(\\frac{m^d}{m^h}\\right)^{5/2}\\approx 5.7\\ ] ] for @xmath58 .",
    "in other words , the heat release caused by d saturates at much lower temperature @xmath59 with an essentially smaller peak value .    assuming that the double - well potential can be formed by two identical harmonic potentials with a shifted position of their potential minima , the tunneling parameter is written as  @xcite @xmath60 where e@xmath61 is the zero - point energy in a single harmonic well .",
    "one obtains @xmath62 this relation will also be tested in our experiments .",
    "three samples were prepared from the same nb@xmath5ti@xmath6 target : a large one ( @xmath63 @xmath64 , @xmath65 g ) for the heat release experiments , a small one @xmath66 g ) for the heat capacity and a long one for the thermal conductivity measurements .",
    "firstly , all these samples were heated up to 650@xmath67c for 24 h at a pressure of @xmath68 mbar to reduce the concentration of trapped h , n and o to values less than 10 at ppm . after experiments with pure nbti",
    "the samples were charged with h by 650@xmath69c and different pressure of hydrogen gas .",
    "the h - concentration in the samples was calculated from the mass difference and is given by the ratio of h atoms to the total number of ni and ti atoms . in this way h - concentrations ranging between 1 and 50 % were obtained .",
    "after experiments with nbti - h the hydrogen was again reduced to zero ( in fact the initial mass of the pure nbti was obtained again ) and than charged with d in the same way .",
    "heat capacity and thermal conductivity experiments were performed in a @xmath70he -@xmath71he - dilution refrigerator , the heat release was measured mainly at @xmath72 k after cooling from different @xmath73 in a @xmath71he cryostat . for the heat capacity measurements",
    "both the pulse technique and the relaxation time method were used .",
    "a special cryostat with a low and very stable parasitic heat flow to the sample @xmath74 nw was used .",
    "the rapid cooling of the sample was realized by a mechanical heat switch .",
    "the heat release of the sample was determined from the temperature drift of the sample @xmath75 @xmath76 where @xmath77 is an addendum heat capacity ( the thermometer , the heater , the plate ) .",
    "the total heat capacity @xmath78 ( the time dependence of @xmath79 can be neglected ) and the heat link @xmath80 between the sample and the sample chamber were measured separately .",
    "the sample was fixed by thin nylon threads , which causes by open heat switch together with the electrical wire of the heater and the thermometer the heat link @xmath80 . in some experiments , where the temperature drift was very strong , the heat switch was some times closed during the measurement to reduce the sample temperature @xmath81 to @xmath82 again .",
    "thus , @xmath81 was close to @xmath82 during the whole time of the heat release measurement @xmath83 mk at @xmath72 k ) .",
    "the thermal conductivity of pure nbti is shown in fig .  1 ( black squares ) .",
    "below 1 k the heat capacity is exactly proportional to @xmath84 with an absolute value close to that of vitreous silica ( black triangles ) .",
    "thus , the thermal conductivity of polycrystalline nbti exhibits low temperature anomalies typical for structural glasses in accordance with glassy behavior of the internal friction , observed for the same material in @xcite .",
    "when we increase h or d concentrations in nbti the power law remains always unchanged . at the same time",
    ", we observed a surprising dependence of the absolute value .",
    "namely , the thermal conductivity of nbti with 2 % h shows the expected result being about 6 % smaller the value of pure nbti , i.e. one has an additional scattering on the tunneling states produced by the hydrogen atoms .",
    "however , the thermal conductivity of nbti with 10 % h is 3.4 times larger the value of pure nbti . a similar result",
    "we get with d. a simple explanation of this unexpected behavior is that the local fluctuations , which are responsible for the tunneling states and low thermal conductivity of pure nbti , disappear at higher concentrations of h or d ( @xmath85 ) . in fact , above some critical concentration @xmath86 ( 2%@xmath87 @xmath86 @xmath87 8% ) the hydrogen ( or deuterium ) stabilizes @xmath7 - phases and , as a consequence , one expects that the glassy behavior at low temperatures disappears @xcite . at the same time",
    ", h ( or d ) produces new tunneling states . for this reason , the thermal conductivity is still glassy - like : it is proportional to @xmath84 but with a much larger absolute value due to smaller coupling constants .",
    "we can calculate the parameter @xmath88 from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) with @xmath89 m / s , @xmath90 m / s , @xmath91 g/@xmath64 and @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "the results are presented in fig .  2 .",
    "we see clearly the jump of this parameter between 2 and 8 % h or d. the number of the tunneling states produced by h or d increases rapidly with the concentration for @xmath93 and slowly for higher @xmath94 .",
    "since h ( or d ) is trapped by ti atoms and changes the positions around them , it is necessary that the new positions are free . for higher concentrations",
    "this will be less and less the case and we can even expect a maximum in the dependence of the number of tunneling states on the h or d concentration . up to 50% this maximum was not observed .",
    "partially this could be masked by an additional scattering on dislocations , which can appear at high concentrations of h or d like in case of hydrogen in cooper  @xcite .",
    "we did not try to introduce more than 50% h , since a too high concentration of h destroys the nbti sample .",
    "typical results of the heat capacity measurements are shown in fig .",
    "3 .    below 1",
    "k , where the contribution of the electron systems can be neglected , the heat capacity is proportional to @xmath95 ( with a coefficient denoted here as @xmath96 ) .",
    "this linear term is roughly proportional to the concentration of h or d : @xmath97 mj / gk@xmath98 for @xmath94 @xmath99 2% . for smaller @xmath94",
    ", @xmath96 increases due to additional tunneling systems caused by the @xmath7-@xmath8 - fluctuations in nbti .",
    "the distribution parameter @xmath18 of tlss can be calculated with eqs .",
    "( [ eq3])-([eq5 ] ) , @xmath100 s. together with @xmath88 from the thermal conductivity we get also @xmath101 . the most important parameters deduced from the heat capacity are given in table i.    .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for @xmath102 the contribution of anomalous tlss reduces significantly , but still remains nonzero .",
    "thus , with the distribution functions @xmath103 and @xmath104 shown in fig .",
    "12 we can explain all results of the heat release and the heat capacity measurements presented in tables iii and iv .",
    "important questions arise : what is the origin of @xmath105 in fig .",
    "12 and why did we observe a reduced but nevertheless a well defined contribution of anomalous tlss to the heat release for @xmath106 ?",
    "moreover , comparing the corresponding barrier heights with @xmath107 deduced from the acoustic experiments we found that their values are always smaller . for example , in vitreous silica @xmath108 k while @xmath109 k. in ( zro@xmath1)@xmath110(cao)@xmath111 we found for @xmath112 that @xmath113 k in good agreement with @xmath114 k deduced from the measured on the same sample damping peak of internal friction @xcite while for @xmath106 we got @xmath115 k. this is also valid for nbti - h / d . in nbti - h @xmath116",
    "is shorter @xmath117 since @xmath118 , and the observed contribution to the heat release is caused by @xmath105 .",
    "their barrier height @xmath119 k. for nbti - d , @xmath116 is larger @xmath117 and the barrier height of anomalous tlss causing the giant heat release is @xmath120 k ( @xmath121 min ) .    in order to answer these questions",
    "one has to assume the existence of some process leading to a drastic reduction of @xmath122 to @xmath123 after cooling the sample .",
    "for example , if the origin of such process is the mechanical deformation of the sample during the rapid cooling , we would have got some distribution of the internal stresses in the sample . in this case",
    ", the normal tlss will be situated in the regions with a minimal stresses .",
    "a maximum change of @xmath124 happens to be in the regions with the maximum deformations . in the intermediated regions there",
    "will exist tlss with @xmath10-values between @xmath122 and @xmath123 , which could cause @xmath105 in the distribution function @xmath103 . in principle , every process which transforms a part of normal tunneling systems into anomalous ones will produce tlss with tunneling parameters between these two groups .",
    "the appearance of a contribution to the heat release at @xmath125 and @xmath126 is probably the consequence of this fact . from this point of view",
    "it is not surprising that for all amorphous and glass - like crystalline solids , where @xmath127 , a contribution of the anomalous tlss to the heat release was observed .",
    "as it follows from measured @xmath33 anomalous systems should have large barrier heights . on the other hand they are able to relax in experiment time and give contributions to the heat release and the heat capacity .",
    "furthemore , in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) the edge of the distribution function @xmath103 can be extracted from the heat release measurements in both nbti - h and ( zro@xmath1)@xmath110(cao)@xmath111 .",
    "@xmath128 can be shifted more to the left ( like for nbti and a - sio@xmath1 ) or more to the right ( nbti - d ) ( see fig .",
    "this is also clearly seen from the wrong isotopic relations for anomalous tlss ( see table iii ) as well as from the relation @xmath129 ( see table iv ) .    as was mentioned above this situation",
    "could be explained by either markedly different values of @xmath130 and @xmath131 or some kind of instability which influences barrier heights . since the correct isotopic relation is not fulfilled for observed @xmath131 ,",
    "it is naturally to suggest that @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , the second possibility looks more reasonable . indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite a generation of strong local mechanical stresses @xmath133 during the cooling of sample was suggested . in this case , the fluctuations in thermal expansion of glass - like system can reach giant values . according to @xcite ,",
    "the thermal expansion coefficients @xmath134 take random values inside the dilatation centers of the sample .",
    "the dispersion in the distribution of @xmath134 is suggested to be much bigger of its mean value : @xmath135 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 are the global ( local ) gruneisen parameters , respectively , and @xmath139 is the deformation potential .",
    "supposing the normal ( gaussian ) distribution of the dilatation centers , the maximum value of @xmath140 is estimated as @xmath141    the stresses at the local thermal expansion are written as @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the shear modulus . in accordance with the eyring model an applied stress results in a linear reduction of the barrier height @xcite @xmath144 where @xmath145 is a so - called activation volume ( a typical volume required for a molecular shear rearrangement ) .",
    "let @xmath146 be the necessary reduction of the barrier height to make the relaxation time comparable with the experiment time , i.e. @xmath147 , where @xmath148 .",
    "then the minimum value of @xmath149 reads @xmath150 therefore , the fulfilment of the condition @xmath151 would be a signal that anomalous tlss can be produced by random local stresses .",

    "k@xmath155 @xmath156 ev , @xmath157 pa , @xmath158 nm@xmath159 , one obtains that @xmath160 .",
    "this estimation allows us to conclude that mechanical deformations can generate anomalous tlss .    by fitting with eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) the heat release data for ( zro@xmath1)@xmath110(cao)@xmath111 and nbtih@xmath161 we can deduce also the dependence of @xmath116 on the average energy @xmath162 ( see fig .",
    "as is seen from fig .",
    "14 , @xmath116 is roughly proportional to @xmath163 .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the sample was repeatedly cooled and warmed during experiment so that every next cycle is accompanied by a small relaxation of internal stresses ( there is a hysteresis ) .",
    "the assumption that the cut - off in the distribution function of anomalous tlss is caused by the maximum barrier height of normal tlss @xmath164 with @xmath165 , i.e. @xmath166 also explains the observed isotopic effect .",
    "taking into account that @xmath164 and @xmath167 are defined by nbti matrix we conclude that @xmath168 being independent from the mass of tlss .",
    "therefore the relation between anomalous tunneling parameters takes the following form : @xmath169    since @xmath170 and @xmath171 , we expect to obtain @xmath172 and this relation was indeed observed ( see table iii ) .",
    "thus , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) with an increase of @xmath123 the case @xmath173 ( nbti - h ) is changed by @xmath174 ( nbti - d ) .",
    "as discussed above , in the first case we have @xmath175 , @xmath176 with @xmath177 and , hence , @xmath178 . in the second case",
    ", one has @xmath179 , @xmath180 and we observe a giant heat release .",
    "all these conclusions agree with the experimental results .",
    "moreover , we can explain now also the additional exponential contribution to the heat release observed just after the cooling of nbti - h .",
    "this behavior is seen when @xmath181 is close to the time necessary for cooling the sample .",
    "let us analyze the heat release data of nbti - h with eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) where @xmath182 is determined by @xmath18 , @xmath183 and @xmath184 for @xmath185 with the only free fitting parameter @xmath116 .",
    "this fit describes the experimental data shown in fig .",
    "12 perfectly well with an energy dependence of @xmath116 similar to that observed for ( zro@xmath186)@xmath110(cao)@xmath111 ( see fig .",
    "thus , @xmath187 s with a corresponding @xmath188 . the estimation of @xmath189 with eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) gives @xmath190 with a corresponding @xmath191 s , which is much larger our longest measuring time of @xmath192 s in the heat release experiment with nbti - d .",
    "notice that the effective masses can be influenced by the dressing effect ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , in our case this effect can not give any reasonable explanation of the results , since it is necessary that the effective mass of h must be increased by a factor of 4 , while at the same time the effective mass of d remains unchanged .",
    "in addition , the coupling constants between the tunnelling systems and the lattice are very small for h and d ( see table i ) .",
    "in all investigated materials , nbti , nbti - h , and nbti - d , the low - temperature anomalies typical for structural glasses have been observed for main investigated characteristics : the thermal conductivity , the heat capacity and the heat release .",
    "the thermal conductivity of nbti - h / d increases roughly 3 times for concentrations of h or d larger a critical concentration of 2% .",
    "h or d with concentrations larger 2% stabilize the @xmath7-phases of nbti . in this way , the tlss of the nbti matrix which are caused by local fluctuations between the @xmath7- and @xmath8- phases disappear .",
    "thus , at concentrations higher than the critical one , the glassy behavior of nbti - h / d is determined by the tlss of h or d only and we have a good system to investigate the isotopic effect of tlss in glasses .",
    "two kinds of tlss contribute to the heat release at a given time .",
    "this follows from their different freezing temperatures .",
    "consequently , tlss with very different barrier heights exhibit the same relaxation time and contribute at the same time to the heat release .",
    "this result agrees with that observed in all other investigated amorphous and glass - like crystalline materials .    for tlss with the lower barrier heights we have observed all isotopic effects estimated within the standard tunneling model .",
    "namely , the distribution parameter @xmath195 is about 40% larger @xmath196 , the freezing temperature @xmath197 is roughly 2 times larger the value @xmath198 , while the ratio of maximum values of the heat release gives the expected factor close to 6 .    a completely different behavior we have discovered for the tlss with the higher freezing temperatures , which we call anomalous tlss . instead of the expected reduction of the distribution parameter @xmath199 in comparison with @xmath200 of about 40%",
    "we have observed its increase with the factor of 3.8 . the freezing temperature @xmath201 is found to be larger the freezing temperature @xmath202 instead of the expected reduction by the factor of 2 and we have observed a giant maximum value of the heat release , roughly 10 times larger the maximum value in nbti - h , in contrast to the 6 times smaller expected value . in addition , the distribution parameter @xmath193 is much larger the corresponding value deduced from the heat release data @xmath200 @xmath203 , while for nbti - d we found an excellent agreement between these two parameters .",
    "all these anomalous isotopic effects can not be explained within the standard tunneling model .",
    "we have suggested a simple explanation of these surprising results by making an assumption that a cut - off in the distribution function of anomalous tlss exists .",
    "it can be caused by the cut - off in the distribution of barrier heights at @xmath204 with the corresponding maximum distribution parameter @xmath123 .",
    "we have noted three possibilities for the average value @xmath205 of the tlss contributing to the heat release : @xmath206 , @xmath174 and @xmath207 . in the first case ,",
    "the anomalous tlss contribute to the heat capacity , but not to the heat release ( except for a small contribution which appears also for @xmath208 with large barrier heights , yet smaller than @xmath164 ) . in this case , we have @xmath209 observed for most of investigated amorphous and glass - like crystalline solids including nbti and nbti - h . in the second case ,",
    "the anomalous tlss contribute to both the heat capacity and the heat release and @xmath180 .",
    "a characteristic feature of this case is a giant heat release due to the high freezing temperature of the anomalous tlss .",

    "finally , in the most interesting case @xmath210 the exponential time dependence is expected .",
    "in fact , all three possible cases were observed in ( zro@xmath1)@xmath110(cao)@xmath111 . this is a clear experimental argument that our assumption on the existence of anomalous tlss with high freezing temperatures and , at the same time , small tunneling parameters is quite reasonable . from theoretical point of view",

    "<S> the thermal conductivity , heat capacity and heat release of nbti , nbti - h and nbti - d were measured at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> all three systems reveal low temperature anomalies typical for structural glasses . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that above a concentration of 2% h or d the tunneling states of the nbti matrix disappear . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for higher concentration it is a good system to proof how the change of the mass of tunneling atoms influences the low temperature anomalies . for the heat capacity we found the expected isotopic effect . </S>",
    "<S> however , the anomalous isotopic effect observed for the heat release data can not be explained within the standard tunneling model . </S>",
    "<S> a surprising result is that tunneling systems with very high barrier heights , even the systems with the maximum barrier height , influence remarkable the heat capacity and the heat release data at low temperatures . as a possible origin </S>",
    "<S> , we consider large - scale fluctuations in thermal expansion which could generate anomalous two - level systems . </S>"
