    "quantum nonlocality through entanglement plays a key role as a resource in quantum teleportation , cryptography and error - correcting codes .",
    "there exists , however , another nonlocal phenomenon : quantum nonlocality without entanglement , studied at length by bennett , divincenzo , fuchs , mor , rains , shor , smolin , and wootters in  @xcite .",
    "locality in this sense refers to the elements of an unentangled orthogonal basis ( uob ) being distinguishable by a protocol using only local operations by participants ( each holding one tensor factor ) and classical communication ( locc ) among them , hence such a uob is _ locally distinguishable _ or _",
    "locc distinguishable_. in  @xcite , the authors provide examples of sets of unentangled states that are not locc ( locally ) distinguishable and therefore exhibit nonlocality , give measurement protocols for their optimal distinguishability , state preparation protocols to obtain them , relation to quantum cryptography , and measures to quantify their nonlocality .",
    "this form of nonlocality is connected with construction of entangled states  @xcite , but stands on its own as well  @xcite . under protocols",
    "in which various parties can only measure their own systems ( local measurements ) and classically communicate , distinguishing among certain unentangled states is impossible .",
    "thus , such states encode quantum nonlocality .",
    "it is demonstrably useful in quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , as first observed by goldenberg and vaidman  @xcite , and since used in other schemes for secure communication  @xcite .",
    "the converse is to find sets of states that are identifiable through locc .",
    "a significant body of work is involved with the criteria for recognizing and constructing such states , particularly pertaining the unextendible product basis ( upb )  @xcite , but there have also been some characterizations of unentangled orthogonal basis ( uob ) and of the form of nonlocality in unentangled settings in higher dimensions  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we analyze the set of orthonormal bases consisting of unentangled states ( uob ) in @xmath0 qubits .",
    "we show that in the natural structure of uob as an algebraic variety over @xmath3 , the ones that can be distinguished by locc are precisely those belonging to the irreducible components of highest dimension .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "background ] , we motivate and give an initial set of definitions that connect the orthognality condition of a uob to a set of colorings of a hypercube that we call _ admissible_. in section  [ sec : mainsec ] , we prove the main result that relates maximum number of colors in an admissible coloring of a hypercube to the maximum dimensional component in the set of uob , and describe its implications .",
    "section  [ sec : loccdist ] discusses the locc distinguishability of the uob , and through the theorem of walgate and hardy  @xcite , shows that the maximum dimensional component is the unique such set . in section  [ sec : nonlocc ] we construct uob not distinguishable by locc , hence exhibiting the said nonlocality , and important from the secure communication point of view .",

    "each direction in the 3-cube has 1 ` non - dominant ' and 3 ` dominant ' edges . in the 4-cube ,",
    "each direction has 2 ` non - dominant ' and 6 ` dominant ' edges , and this process can be continued for higher @xmath0 .",
    "we now replace the ` dominant ' color with @xmath0 distinct colors , one for each direction .",
    "the edges previously colored with ` non - dominant ' , we color each with a distinct color , and it can be checked the resulting coloring is admissible . we obtain a maximal coloring , which can be shown just by considering the 2-faces : changing a proper subset of the ` dominant ' colors in a single direction to a new color would break the admissibility condition for some 2-face .",
    "we obtain @xmath224 colors , which is less than the maximal number of colors possible .",
    "therefore we obtain a family of uob not distinguishable by locc for every @xmath0 . following the procedure for @xmath225",
    "we obtain the a uob of the form : @xmath226\\otimes[u_{3}]\\otimes[u_{2}]\\otimes[u_{1 } ] , & & [ u_{4}]\\otimes[u_{6}]\\otimes[u_{5}]\\otimes[\\hat{u}_{1 } ] ,   \\\\ & [ u_{4}]\\otimes[u_{3}]\\otimes[\\hat{u}_{2}]\\otimes[u_{1 } ] , & & [ u_{7}]\\otimes[u_{3}]\\otimes[\\hat{u}_{5}]\\otimes[\\hat{u}_{1 } ] ,   \\\\ & [ u_{8}]\\otimes[\\hat{u}_{3}]\\otimes [ u_{5}]\\otimes[u_{1 } ] , & & [ u_{4}]\\otimes[\\hat{u}_{6}]\\otimes [ u_{5}]\\otimes[\\hat{u}_{1 } ] ,   \\\\ & [ u_{4}]\\otimes[\\hat{u}_{3}]\\otimes[\\hat{u}_{5}]\\otimes[u_{9 } ] , & & [ u_{4}]\\otimes[\\hat{u}_{3}]\\otimes[\\hat{u}_{5}]\\otimes[\\hat{u}_{9 } ] , \\\\ & [ \\hat{u}_{4}]\\otimes[u_{3}]\\otimes[u_{5}]\\otimes[u_{10 } ] , & & [ \\hat{u}_{4}]\\otimes[u_{3}]\\otimes[u_{5}]\\otimes[\\hat{u}_{10 } ] ,   \\\\ & [ \\hat{u}_{4}]\\otimes[u_{11}]\\otimes[\\hat{u}_{5}]\\otimes[u_{1 } ] , & & [ \\hat{u}_{7}]\\otimes[u_{3}]\\otimes[\\hat{u}_{5}]\\otimes[\\hat{u}_{1 } ] ,   \\\\ & [ \\hat{u}_{8}]\\otimes[\\hat{u}_{3}]\\otimes [ u_{5}]\\otimes[u_{1 } ] , & & [ \\hat{u}_{4}]\\otimes[\\hat{u}_{3}]\\otimes [ u_{12}]\\otimes[\\hat{u}_{1 } ] ,   \\\\ & [ \\hat{u}_{4}]\\otimes[\\hat{u}_{11}]\\otimes[\\hat{u}_{5}]\\otimes[u_{1 } ] , & & [ \\hat{u}_{4}]\\otimes[\\hat{u}_{3}]\\otimes[\\hat{u}_{12}]\\otimes[\\hat{u}_{1 } ] .",

    "conversely it is not hard to see that if one direction has a unique color , the two @xmath114 which this direction separates are then colored with distinct colors if the coloring is to be maximal .",
    "we can also reverse the idea . instead of making the new factor use only one vector",
    ", we can also use as many distinct vectors as possible in the new factor . take a single uob @xmath227 with @xmath129 distinct vectors , @xmath229 . then take @xmath233 distinct vectors @xmath234 and construct a new uob @xmath235 the number of distinct vectors used is then @xmath236 . again ,",
    "if we start with a uob not in the maximal dimensional component we again obtain a nondistinguishable uob .",
    "as a remark , one may ask for the minimal number of colors in a maximally colored @xmath96 . that is , the dimension of the lowest dimensional component of uob .",
    "let us call this number @xmath237 .",

    "this led us to the definition of an _ admissible _ coloring and a partial order on such colorings .",
    "the maximal elements of this order define families of uob of dimensions corresponding to their number of colors .",
    "each coloring defines a forest of colors , such that the maximum dimensional family corresponds to a single tree of @xmath239 colors ( dimension of the family ) .",
    "this gave us a complete characterization of the maximum dimensional family , and its structure .",
    "knowing the structure it is apparent through a result of walgate and hardy  @xcite that the only locc distinguishable uob belong to this family .    from the perspective of secure communication , like the qkd protocols , it is the uob that are _ not _ locc distinguishable that exhibit the nonlocality requisite in the success of the protocols .",
    "the generic uob being locc distinguishable , we constructed examples of maximal families of uob of dimensions less that the maximum .",
    "we generalized the earliest examples of such uob ( for @xmath79 ) in  @xcite to arbitrary number @xmath0 of qubits , and described other constructions that build maximal families from known ones .",
    "this leaves open certain immediate questions .",
    "a complete characterization of all the families of uob is the strongest of them .",
    "short of that , it would be interesting to know what is the lower bound on the dimension of a maximal uob . in the domain of applications ,",
    "perhaps more interesting secure communication protocols may be possible by employing these results .",
    "it would be very useful if the ideas we have presented could be extended directly as tools to analyze uob for systems of qudits . unfortunately given @xmath240 \\in { \\mathbb p}^{d-1}$ ] there is not a unique orthogonal @xmath241 \\in { \\mathbb p}^{d-1}$ ] if @xmath242 . to address",
