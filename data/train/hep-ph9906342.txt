    "one of the main goals at present and the next generation of colliders is to search for evidence of the higgs boson of the standard model ( sm ) .",

    "common to all models of low energy supersymmetry where the couplings remain perturbative up to very high energies , however , is the prediction of a relatively low mass higgs boson @xcite .",
    "thus the search for the lightest higgs boson is a crucial test for susy theories .",
    "the question arises as to the kinds of limits that can be placed on the mass of the lightest higgs boson in various susy models .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the values that the mass of the lightest higgs boson can have in theories of gauge - mediated supersymmetry - breaking ( gmsb ) .",
    "gmsb models provide an alternative to models where supersymmetry breaking is communicated to the visible sector by gravitational interactions @xcite .",
    "the defining characteristic of gmsb models is that the susy breaking is communicated to the visible sector by gauge interactions .",
    "the messenger sector is composed of some set of superfields with sm couplings , but which are not part of the spectrum of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . in minimal models of gmsb",
    ", these superfields are assumed to form complete su(5 ) multiplets so that the apparent unification of the gauge couplings can be preserved .",
    "however , the superfields that act as messengers need not form complete gut multiplets .",
    "other superfields can be present at the messenger scale that do not act as messengers and have little or no effect on the masses of the mssm particles , but can still participate in ensuring gauge coupling unification @xcite .",
    "the messenger sector in these generalized gmsb models thereby contains superfields that transform as @xmath0 mulitplets , but not as complete gut multiplets .",
    "we will explore the values that the mass of the lightest higgs boson can acquire in minimal gmsb models and the generalized gmsb models discussed in @xcite .",
    "we seek the answers to two questions .",
    "first , is there a bound on the lightest higgs mass in these general classes of @xmath0 multiplets as we vary the parameters of the models ?",
    "second , are the predictions for the lightest higgs mass still within the detectable range of the upcoming tevatron runs ?",
    "here we will outline the generalization of the messenger sector as suggested by @xcite .",
    "we assume that the messenger fields couple to a single chiral superfield @xmath4 , so that the superpotential contains the term @xmath5 the induced gaugino mass parameters are ( for @xmath6 ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 where @xmath4 and @xmath9 here represent the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the chiral scalar superfields @xmath4 and @xmath9 , respectively . the function @xmath10 is defined by @xmath11\\ ] ] and @xmath12 for a pair of @xmath13 of su(@xmath14 ) , and @xmath15 for an antisymmetric two - index tensor of su(@xmath14 ) .",

    "we define the convenient numbers @xmath19    the requirement that the mssm gauge couplings should stay perturbative ( @xmath20 ) up to the unification scale amounts to @xmath21 we shall therefore consider messenger sectors that contain up to four sets of su(5 ) multiplets @xmath22 , or one @xmath23 , or one @xmath22 together with one @xmath23",
    ". we will also consider generalized messenger sectors consisting of various multiplets of su(3 ) @xmath24 su(2 ) @xmath24 u(1 ) as in @xcite .",

    "we imposed the condition of peturbativity on the gauge couplings as well as the possibility of unification . for each choice of messenger sector",
    ", we studied the variation in the higgs mass with respect to the gmsb parameters @xmath88 and @xmath3 .",
    "the higgs mass depends sensitively on @xmath88 and @xmath3 , but not much on the messenger sector scale , @xmath55 . for @xmath3 less than 100 tev ,",
    "the bound on the lightest higgs mass is 132 gev . for @xmath3",
    "equal to 500 tev , the bound increases to 139 gev .",
