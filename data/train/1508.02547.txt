    "the birth of functional renormalization group methods is tightly connected to the investigation of scaling properties of the effective potential in statistical field theories with @xmath0 or @xmath3 symmetries @xcite , and it represents its first non - trivial application @xcite . over the years",
    "the interest in properties that can be extracted from the renormalization group flow of the potential in a local approximation has been revitalized at various stages @xcite .",
    "the effective potential of a @xmath0-symmetric scalar field theory has been studied with various techniques to unveil the underlying universality classes , which include the ising model .",
    "the critical exponents have been determined to high accuracy within polynomial expansions @xcite and non - polynomial solutions have been studied numerically by applying scaling solutions methods @xcite . recently",
    ", even global solutions have been constructed with very high numerical precision @xcite .    in the past few years",
    ", the scaling solutions approach was adopted to analytically continue various parameters which enter the renormalization group flow , including the dimensionality of space @xcite , the number @xmath4 of fields @xcite or both @xcite .",
    "the analytic continuation of these parameters offers new insights into properties of the underlying statistical models , such as their emergence on spaces of fractional dimensions , the occurrence of the mermin - wagner theorem and constraints on the existence of the various multicritical models .    in this paper",
    "we extend the scaling solution approach in three prominent ways .",
    "first , we will carefully lay down and discuss the theoretical mechanism with which a scaling solution occurs for a specific statistical model , which has often been overlooked in previous works .",
    "this occurrence will be illustrated mostly through the example of the three dimensional ising model .",
    "second , we will introduce two methods to compute the critical exponents of a model : a shooting approach ( which has been used previously in @xcite ) to calculate critical exponents in three and two dimensions ) and the novel pseudo - spectral method with a slac derivative @xcite .",
    "these two methods treat the boundary conditions for the deformations of a critical potential in different ways ; thus , they are complementary for the approach as will be shown by applying them to the known ising example .",
    "finally , we systematically apply the scaling solution approach to the supersymmetric @xmath5 wess - zumino model in both two @xcite and three dimensions @xcite , for which we compute various critical exponents for its universality classes .",
    "we also study the supersymmetric model on fractional dimensions introducing a novel analytic continuation .",

    "[ section_discussion ] briefly discusses our results .",
    "the appendixes are dedicated to further clarifying some properties of the renormalization group flow and the methods used in this work .      for clarity purposes we introduce all the basic concepts used in the present paper adopting the illustrative example of a simple @xmath0-invariant scalar field on @xmath6 . this introduction can and will be straightforwardly generalized to the inclusion of supersymmetry later in the corresponding sections .",

    "the local potential approximation ( lpa ) is a non - perturbative truncation of the effective action of a system which includes all the relevant operators in a low energy derivative expansion @xcite . within this approximation ,",
    "higher derivative operators are neglected but all local interactions are included in a non - perturbative fashion .",
    "the lpa of a simple @xmath0-invariant scalar @xmath7 in @xmath8 dimensions thus truncates the effective action of the system to @xmath9 = \\int { \\rm d}^d x \\left\\ { \\frac{z}{2}\\partial_\\mu \\varphi \\partial^\\mu\\varphi + v(\\varphi ) \\right\\}\\,,\\ ] ] where we included a wavefunction renormalization constant @xmath10 for the field @xmath7 and the local potential @xmath11 .",
    "more precisely , the truncation represents an extension of the original lpa of a simple scalar that goes under the name of improved lpa ( a.k.a .",
    "lpa ) , as it includes a non - trivial wavefunction renormalization for @xmath7 and thus allows the field to have a non - canonical scaling in the guise of an anomalous dimension for the renormalized field @xmath12 .",
    "we study the renormalization group flow of the scalar models using functional renormalization group ( frg ) methods . in this approach",
    "the path - integral of the system is constructed as @xmath13 } = \\int { \\cal d}\\chi \\ , { \\rm e}^{-s[\\chi]-\\delta s_k[\\chi ] + ( \\chi-\\varphi)\\frac{\\delta\\gamma_k}{\\delta\\varphi}}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 $ ] is a bare action for the microscopic field @xmath15 and @xmath16 $ ] is a cutoff that suppresses the propagation of the infrared modes relative to a given reference scale @xmath17",
    ". the infrared cutoff should be quadratic in the field @xmath18 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\int { \\rm d}^d x \\ , { \\rm d}^d x ' \\ , \\chi(x ) { \\cal r}_k(x - x ' ) \\chi(x')\\,,\\ ] ] and its kernel @xmath19 suppresses the propagation of the infrared modes by directly modifying the bare propagator of the theory .",
    "the dependence of on the kernel @xmath19 encodes the scheme - dependence of the method ; thus , different kernels implement different coarse - grainings .",
    "however , the kernel has to satisfy in the limit @xmath20 the property @xmath21 , which ensures that reduces to the standard path - integral of the ( full ) effective action @xmath22 $ ] of the system when the reference scale @xmath17 is taken to zero .",

    "therefore , rather than achieving the renormalization of the theory through the inclusion of counterterms , it is customary to use to derive the exact and finite frg equation @xmath28   =   \\frac{1}{2 } { \\rm tr } \\left(\\gamma^{(2)}_k[\\varphi]+{\\cal r}_k\\right)^{-1}k\\partial_k { \\cal r}_k\\,,\\ ] ] and use it to investigate the renormalization of the model .",

    "various remarks are in order to explain the meaning of : the flow of the local potential is defined as the ( normalized ) flow of the eaa in the limit of constant field content , as is usual in quantum field theoretical applications .",
    "the field @xmath32 represents the fourier transform of @xmath33 with respect to the momentum @xmath34 ; thus , the anomalous dimension @xmath35 is extracted quite naturally from the coefficient of the @xmath36 term in the two - point function belonging to @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "since the truncation includes only a field - independent wavefunction renormalization constant , it is necessary for consistency to project the two - point function of @xmath23 $ ] to a distinguished field configuration @xmath37 . in applications @xmath37",
    "is chosen in a physically meaningful way as the minimum of the effective potential defined by @xmath38 .",
    "the configuration @xmath37 thus plays the role of the order parameter of the @xmath0-symmetry @xmath39 , and the possibility that it has non - zero values represents a clear separation from standard perturbation theory .",
    "let us now define the modified momentum - space propagator at constant field @xmath40 where @xmath41 is @xmath42 times the fourier transform of the cutoff kernel in coordinate space . with the modified propagator we can give a compact evaluation of based on a general cutoff @xmath43 here",
    ", the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the argument @xmath44 , whereas elsewhere it is the derivative with respect to the ( constant ) field .",
    "we can give explicit expressions for the flow equation for the effective potential and the anomalous dimension after specifying the cutoff function . while , in principle , any choice compatible with the properties of a suitable cutoff is possible , for the purpose of this paper it is useful to choose one that allows for an explicit calculation of the flow .",
    "we choose the popular optimized cutoff and explicitly factor out the wavefunction renormalization of the field , so that in momentum space the kernel of reads @xmath45 the optimized cutoff is a distribution and therefore the momentum space integrals must be treated with care . in requires a normalization for the integral of the product of the heaviside step function @xmath46 and its first derivative @xmath47 .",
    "given a regular test function @xmath48 we normalize @xmath49 this normalization is consistent with the limit of the same integral evaluated for any sequence of smooth functions approaching @xmath46 . ]",
    "let us also introduce the dimensionless renormalized field @xmath50 , which is the natural argument of the dimensionless renormalized potential @xmath51 together @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the appropriate variables to investigate the scaling properties of the system , and in fact we shall use them for the remainder of this section . for notational simplicity",

    "the functional @xmath56 $ ] represents the scaling part of the flow and it originates from the change of dimensionful variables to dimensionless ones .",
    "its form is independent from the cutoff choice and therefore from the scheme of computation .",
    "the functional @xmath57 $ ] , instead , encodes the nontrivial features of the flow and depends on the cutoff .",
    "we now compute from the anomalous dimension explicitly to obtain @xmath58 where again we assume @xmath37 to be the expectation value of the order parameter of the system . for later convenience",
    "we also give the result of an alternative computation of the anomalous dimension , which comes as the limit @xmath59 of the anomalous dimension of the goldstone modes of the @xmath3-model @xmath60 this definition has often and successfully been used in place of @xmath35 on the basis of physical arguments .",
    "thus , we include it in our analysis and refer to it as goldstone anomalous dimension .",
    "the reason why @xmath35 and @xmath61 are different is not because the limit @xmath62 of the @xmath3-model is discontinuous , but rather because @xmath35 represents the limiting value of the anomalous dimension of the massive higgs field in the broken @xmath3 phase .",
    "let us now discuss some general property of the flow of the potential .",
    "the computation can be manifestly analytically continued to any non - integer dimensionality , and for the present work we are mostly concerned with the interval @xmath63 which is bounded by the lower and upper critical dimensions of the @xmath64 model .",
    "note that the flow of the potential depends _ parametrically _ on the anomalous dimension given in or .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath65 we can extract some general properties of the flow that are insensitive to the values of @xmath35 .",
    "the flow is a pde representing the evolution of the potential with respect to the scale @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath17-independent ( stationary ) solutions are the critical solutions ( fixed points ) of the flow , and they correspond to critical models of the corresponding field theory .",
    "this means that critical solutions solve the non - linear ode @xmath66+{\\cal f}_{v,\\eta}[v'']=0\\,,\\ ] ] which is called a fixed point equation .",
    "the function @xmath67 can be explicitly inverted to cast the ode in a standard form @xmath68\\,]\\,.\\ ] ] while the explicit form of this ode depends on the cutoff , it is easy to prove that for any cutoff @xmath69 \\sim 1/x\\,,\\,\\,\\,\\ , { \\rm for}\\,\\,\\,\\ , x \\to \\infty\\,,\\ ] ] which implies @xmath70\\,,\\,\\,\\,\\ , { \\rm when}\\,\\,\\,\\ , { \\cal s}_{v,\\eta } \\sim 0\\,.\\ ] ] in other words the second derivative of the potential is expected to diverge at points @xmath71 at which the scaling part becomes zero .",
    "these points can be determined implicitly by the equation @xmath72 as @xmath73 it is possible to show that any attempt to integrate the fixed point equation starting from initial conditions at @xmath74 will stop ( with probability one ) at a singularity located at @xmath71 at which @xmath75 diverges , but @xmath76 and @xmath77 stay finite @xcite .",
    "in addition , if @xmath78 then @xmath76 and @xmath77 have the same sign ; similarly , if @xmath79 they have opposite signs .    ideally , we are interested in global analytic solutions of , which thus avoid the appearance of singularities such as for finite values of the field @xmath71 , and we hope that these global solutions can be obtained by numerically integrating the ode with fine tuned boundary conditions . in practice , it turns out that in the process of integrating singularities are the rule and not the exception . to investigate the singular solutions we first choose a suitable parametrization . since is a second order ode ,",
    "any solution can be characterized by the two initial conditions @xmath80 and @xmath81 . one of the conditions is , however , fixed by the requirement of @xmath0-invariance to be @xmath82 , thus ensuring the even parity of the solutions .",
    "it proves convenient to parametrize the second condition using the value @xmath83 rather than @xmath80 .",
    "we thus choose , as an initial condition @xmath84 , which implies that @xmath85 which makes explicit the fact that @xmath86 is a singular point for the ode .",
    "this comes from the more general property that , for any cutoff , the flow is well defined whenever @xmath87 . with the exception of the trivial case @xmath88 , it is possible to observe numerically that almost all solutions that can be considered within @xmath89 diverge at a singular point @xmath71 defined by whose position depends on @xmath90 .",
    "we therefore denote @xmath91 the location of the singularity as a function of @xmath90 .",

    "the scaling part is negative and at any extremum with negative @xmath94 the scaling part is positive . since for @xmath95",
    "the scaling part is negative at @xmath74 and since the potential ( of a stable theory ) is positive for large values of the field we conclude that _ every globally defined fixed point solution @xmath96 is positive_. if @xmath94 takes negative values for certain fields , then it would have a minimum @xmath97 with negative @xmath94 and the scaling part would change sign between @xmath74 and @xmath97 .",
    "this in turn implies that the scaling part would vanish at some field @xmath98 or that the potential would be singular at @xmath91 .",

    "we confirm the presence of both the ising class and its supersymmetric counterpart , while in two dimensions infinitely many stationary solutions can be observed which we identify with the minimal models of cft and super - cft .",
    "it is rather exceptional that the infinite tower of minimal models is visible within such a simple truncation of the renormalization group flow that contains only a local potential and an anomalous dimension for the field .    at various stages",
    ", we offered a new understanding of the mechanism with which new critical solutions appear as stationary solutions of the flow of the local potential . the key idea is tightly connected to ( and best visualized through ) the ginzburg - landau theory : new critical models appear whenever new local operators turn into relevant deformations of the spectrum of the theory .",
    "we explicitly observe that the appearance of each model is governed by the canonical scaling of a specific operator which can be pinpointed , for example , by analytically continuing the renormalization group flow between two and three dimensions .",
    "the critical models can be identified as discontinuities in the plot of the domain of existence of all possible models using both scaling arguments and the landau description that counts the number of nodes of the solutions @xcite .    for the sake of the exposition",
    ", we concentrated our attention on the ising and tricritical ising classes , and their @xmath5 supersymmetric counterparts .",
    "most importantly , we introduced two new methods to compute the relevant deformations of these models : the shooting and the pseudo - spectral slac methods .",
    "while the shooting method has already been applied in @xcite to compute only the critical exponent of the correlation length , we showed that it can be used quite effectively to obtain many low - lying exponents .",
    "one important ingredient of the present work is the application of the slac derivative method to the computation of the spectrum .",
    "this latter approach can in fact easily produce a large number of critical exponents with one single calculation , effectively beating all other computationally slower algorithms and showing a mild dependence on the boundary conditions .",
    "the only limitation of the slac derivative method is in the size of the numerically determined critical solution , which is finite in our implementation .",
    "we thus expect the method to work even better when global solutions are available , such as in @xcite .",
    "the functional renormalization group method is an efficient tool to analytically continue the flow in parameters that are fixed in most alternative approaches , for example lattice simulations , such as the dimensionality of the system .",
    "we thus provided an analytic continuation of the @xmath5 wess - zumino model between two and three dimensions that , to the best of our knowledge , is new .",
    "this continuation can continuously follow the stationary solutions of the local potential flow from three to two dimensions , showing explicitly what the critical dimensions are at which new models appear . without wave function renormalization",
    "the critical dimensions of the supersymmetric wess - zumino model agree with those of the yukawa model with the same number of on - shell degrees of freedom calculated in @xcite .",
    "it is an interesting open question whether this remains true beyond the lpa truncation and , in particular , with non - zero anomalous dimensions .",
    "a particular feature of our work is that we can give a self - consistent description of any critical model within a very simple local potential approximation of the renormalization group flow .",
    "we provided an extensive and detailed numerical analysis of ising and tricritical ising models .",
    "our numerical results are in good agreement with those obtained by dedicated monte carlo simulations and by cft for the critical exponent of the correlation length @xmath151 , but typically fail in determining the anomalous dimension @xmath35 accurately .",
    "a better determination of the anomalous dimension within the functional approach is crucial for improving the accuracy of the method .",
    "it is natural to compare our results for the simple scalar field theory with morris contributions to the derivative expansion of the renormalization group @xcite , in which the local potential approximation is complemented by a field - dependent wavefunction renormalization and for which an additional scaling symmetry ( due to the choice of a powerlaw cutoff ) allows to determine the anomalous dimension from the boundary conditions of the flow .",
    "we find a qualitative agreement with the results of @xcite for both the ising and tricritical ising classes .",
    "as expected , the agreement becomes increasingly worse when the field dependent wavefunction renormalization of @xcite deviates from the value one .",
    "the lesson to be learned here is that , while the local potential approximation works extraordinarily well in showing that the critical models are visible in our functional renormalization group approach , better numerical estimates of the critical parameter can only be achieved by enlarging the local potential truncation to include further operators .",
    "therefore , an extension of our analysis to truncations of the effective action which account for a larger space of operators in functional form , such as a field dependent wavefunction renormalization , represents the most important and compelling prospect of our work .",
    "another natural comparison for our work would be the recent developments on the conformal bootstrap approach @xcite .",
    "the latter uses ward - identities of conformal field theory to constrain the operator algebra and provide accurate predictions for the critical exponents of the ising model . in our approach",
    ", however , conformal invariance is an outcome of the requirement of scale invariance by spotting stationary solutions of the renormalization group flow and applying the landau classification to the solutions .",
    "thus it is tempting to speculate that in a functional renormalization group approach it might not be necessary to use the full power of conformal field theory , but simply enhance the correlators appropriately to correctly capture the long range correlations in the vicinity of a critical point .",
    "such an extension of the functional truncation might roughly follow the lines of @xcite , or be dictated by the desire of maintaining two - loops universality when continuing the results to four dimensions @xcite ( see also @xcite for a conformal field theory perspective ) .",
