    "the generation and evolution of the magnetic field in neutron stars continue to evoke much interest , particularly because there is as yet no consensus on the question of field generation .",
    "the field could be a fossil remnant from the progenitor star in the form of abrikosov fluxoids embedded in the proton superconductor of the core ( baym , pethick & pines 1969 , ruderman 1972 ) .",
    "or it could be generated after the formation of a neutron star in which case the currents would be entirely confined to the solid crust ( blandford , applegate & hernquist 1983 , urpin , levshakov & yakovlev 1986 ) .",
    "alternatively , a seed magnetic field could be amplified due to the entropy - driven convection in a young neutron star ( thompson & duncan 1993 ) . observations and statistical analyses of existing pulsar data , however , indicate that significant decay of magnetic field is achieved only if the neutron star is a member of an interacting binary ( see bhattacharya 1995 , 1996 , van den heuvel 1995 , verbunt & van den heuvel 1995 and references therein ) irrespective of the generation mechanism .",
    "+ the processes responsible for the field evolution , in neutron stars which are members of binaries , are - a ) expulsion of the magnetic flux from the superconducting core during the phase of propeller spin - down , b ) rapid ohmic decay of the crustal field in an accretion - heated crust and c ) screening of the field by accreted matter . amongst these , the diamagnetic screening of the field by accreted matter depends on the detailed geometry of the material flow and whether it can have a long - term effect is still not very clear ( konar 1997 , choudhuri & konar 2002 ) .",
    "the rest of the models invoke ohmic decay of the current loops , residing in the crust , for a permanent decrease in the field strength ( see konar & bhattacharya 2001 for a brief review ) . in either case , the effect of accretion is two - fold .",
    "the heating reduces the electrical conductivity , and consequently the ohmic decay time - scale , inducing a faster decay . at the same time",
    "the material movement , caused by the deposition of matter on top of the crust , pushes the original current carrying layers into deeper and denser regions where the higher conductivity slows the decay down .",
    "+ though the problem of the evolution of the magnetic field in neutron stars have been investigated by many authors a fully general relativistic treatment has not been attempted by many .",
    "recently , sengupta ( 1997 , 1998 ) addressed this issue for isolated pulsars and found that the modification introduced by a general relativistic treatment is significantly large .",
    "however , our results are at variance with this claim ( ramachandra & vishweshwara 2000 ) .",
    "indeed this is supported by the recent work of page , geppert & zannias ( 2000 ) and geppert , page & zannias ( 2000 ) .",
    "these authors have investigated coupled spin , magnetic field and thermal evolution of isolated neutron stars in a general relativistic framework . and they find that the change in the final field strength is quite small . + in a series of papers ( konar & bhattacharya 1997 , 1999a , 1999b ) we have discussed the accretion induced field evolution in neutron stars .",
    "the formalism adopted in these papers implicitly assumes a flat space - time . in this work",
    "we report the results of our investigation of the field evolution in an accreting neutron star adopting a general relativistic framework .",
    "our aim is to calculate the amount of modification introduced by assuming a curved space - time vis - a - vis the uncertainties already existing in the field evolution calculation assuming a flat space - time .",
    "it is well known that such uncertainties arise out of a lack of knowledge regarding the values of various crustal parameters ( like the density at which the currents are concentrated or the impurity content of the crust ) and the observations are still not adequate to define those with better precision .",
    "+ in this work we assume that the currents supporting the field are initially completely confined to the crust",
    ". this assumption does not affect the general qualitative conclusions obtained from our present calculation . because , it has already been shown ( konar & bhattacharya 1999b ) that an initial configuration supported by the magnetic fluxoids in the proton superconductor behaves in a similar fashion once it is converted to crustal currents by spin - down driven flux expulsion .",
    "+ we also assume the mass accretion to be spherical .",
    "of course , except for very large values of mass transfer the accretion would be channeled through the polar cap .",
    "the detailed nature of this material flow and its effect on the magnetic field has recently been investigated ( choudhuri & konar 2002 , konar & choudhuri 2002 ) .",
    "but such flows are confined only to the layers very close to the surface .",
    "but the currents would normally be concentrated in the deeper curtal layers for the magnetic field to be long lived . and in these layers",
    "the material movement would be purely radial due to the overall compression of the neutron star , as a result of an increase in the mass .",
    "therefore , an assumption of a spherical accretion would not introduce any significant error in our present calculations .",
    "+ the organisation of the paper is as follows . in section [ sinduct ]",
    "we derive the covariant form of the induction equation that governs the temporal evolution of the magnetic field . in section [ scrust ]",
    "we discuss the detailed form of the induction equation , both for a flat and a curved space - time , in the crust of a neutron star .",
    "section [ sns ] provides some details of the microphysics of the neutron star required for our investigation . in section [ sresults ]",
    "we present the results of our calculation and finally conclude in section [ sconcl ] .",
    "the induction equation in a flat space - time is given by ( jackson 1975 ) : = ( v ) - ( ) , [ e - ind ] where @xmath0 is the velocity of material movement and @xmath1 is the electrical conductivity of the medium . to obtain the covariant form of the induction equation we make use of the covariant form of the maxwell s equations",

    "it should be noted that we have neglected the displacement current here and @xmath9 since we are only interested in the time evolution of the magnetic field . for",

    "= - ^ f _ u^ , [ e - field ] where @xmath13 is the four - dimensional levi - civita tensor ( wald 1984 ) . therefore eq.([e - coind ] ) gives the covariant form of the induction equation which reduces to eq.([e - ind ] ) in the limit of a flat metric .",
    "we must also mention here that in this work we assume that the magnetic field is weak enough for the electrical conductivity to be isotropic .",
    "in this work we shall follow the formalism developed by konar & bhattacharya ( 1997 - paper i hereafter ) for the evolution of a crustal field assuming a flat space - time . and shall compare the results with those obtained in paper i to obtain the modifications introduced by assuming a curved space - time .",
    "+ we assume the star to be accreting at an uniform rate , without any loss of generality , since the purpose of this work is to find the modification introduced by the curvature of space - time . therefore we",
    "shall , for the moment , ignore the realistic situation of a neutron star accreting at different rates as its binary companion goes through different stages of evolution .",
    "assuming the mass flow to be spherically symmetric in the crustal layers of interest , the velocity of the material movement is given by ( see paper i for details ) : v(r ) = - , where @xmath14 is the rate of mass accretion and @xmath15 is the density as a function of radius @xmath16 . + the mass in the crust of the neutron star is quite small compared to the total mass of the star . for example for a intermediate equation of state ( wiringa , fiks & fabrocini 1988 matched to negele & vautherin 1973 and baym , pethick & sutherland 1971 ) the mass of the crust of a 1.4 neutron star would be 0.044 , which is @xmath17 of the total mass .",
    "therefore , in the crust of a non - rotating neutron star we can use the exterior schwarzschild metric given by ( weinberg 1972 ) : g _ = ( -(1 - ) , ( 1 - ) ^-1 , r^2 , r^2 ^2 ) [ e - metric ] without making any significant error . here ,",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath19 being the mass of the star .",
    "+ it should be noted here that the crustal mass of a neutron star remains effectively constant for the accreted masses of the order of 0.1  ( in fact , with a slight decrease ) as the total mass increases .",
    "therefore accretion implies assimilation of the original crust into the superconducting core .",
    "we assume that when the original current carrying regions undergo such assimilation the superconducting transition happnes over a time - scale much smaller than the flux - expulsion time - scale and hence the flux remains _ frozen _ thereafter stopping any further decay . since we terminate our calculation long before the crustal mass changes significantly ( as the field ` levels off ' due to _ flux freezing _ much before that ) the use of exterior schwarzschild metric remains valid even in the crust of an accreting neutron star .",
    "+      in a flat space - time : = , where we assume @xmath20 .",
    "this choice of the vector potential ensures a poloidal geometry for @xmath21 . in particular",
    ", we take , _ = , where @xmath22 is the stokes function . in the lowest order of multipole , the dipolar form of the magnetic field",
    "is given by : _",
    "r & = & , + b _ & = & - ; where , the quantities @xmath23 correspond to those in a flat space - time .",
    "the induction equation then takes the form : _",
    "t g(r , t ) = \\{^2_r g(r , t ) - } + _ r g(r , t ) v(r ) .",
    "[ e - dgdtf ] at the pole the magnitude of the magnetic field is proportional to @xmath24 . therefore , to find the time - evolution of the strength of the surface magnetic field at the pole we solve eq.([e - dgdtf ] ) subject to the following boundary conditions",

    "the first condition matches the interior field to an external dipole configuration .",
    "the second condition indicates that as accretion proceeds along with the crustal material the frozen - in flux moves inside the core . for the details regarding the particular form of @xmath27 and the current density corresponding to it",
    ", please see paper i.      in a schwarzschild metric @xmath10 is related to the locally measured magnetic magnetic field @xmath28 by the following relations ( wasserman & shapiro 1983 ) : _ & = & f_r , + b_r & = & - f_. then the choice of , @xmath29 , ensures that @xmath30 and @xmath28 match in a locally flat space - time where @xmath30 is obtained from eq.([e - field ] ) . with this choice",
    ", we have ( wasserman & shapiro 1983 ) : b_r & = & g(r , t ) , + b _ & = & - ( 1 - ) ^1/2 _ r g(r , t ) .",

    "in order to investigate the effect of the curvature of space - time on the evolution a purely crustal field , we consider three equations of state - soft , intermediate and stiff . the soft eos is taken from pandharipande ( 1971 ) ( p71 hereafter ) , the intermediate from wiringa , fiks & fabrocini ( 1988 ) ( wff hereafter ) and the stiff eos from the work by walecka ( 1974 ) ( w74 hereafter ) respectively .",
    "all these eos are matched to negele & vautherin ( 1973 ) and baym , pethick & sutherland for the low - density crustal region . in table",

    "[ e - temp ] extrapolation of this fit to higher rates of accretion gives un - physically high temperatures .",
    "it has been shown by brown ( 2000 ) that the maximum temperature obtained in an accretion heated crust is @xmath32  k. therefore we use this value if the temperature obtained through eq.([e - temp ] ) exceeds it .",
    "it should be noted here that the above results were obtained for a neutron of mass 1.4  with an intermediate equation of state . since",
    ", such calculations do not exist for different masses or different equations of state , use of eq.([e - temp ] ) for all situations introduce some error in our calculation .",
    "but since the purpose of this work is to obtain a measure of the modification in the final field strength by using a general relativistic framework we shall , for the moment , use eq.([e - temp ] ) as an approximate indicator for the crustal temperature .",

    "this is true even when the crustal currents are concentrated at higher densities . to demonstrate this",
    ", we present some calculations for different values of @xmath35 in fig.([fig01 ] ) . in this plot",
    "the evolution of the surface field with time has been shown for two different values of the impurity concentration .",
    "the calculations pertain to two different rates of accretion and for currents concentrated at two different densities .",
    "it is evident from the curves that the impurity content is important only for lower rates of mass accretion .",
    "it should be noted that in fig.([fig01 ] ) the curves * 2aa , 2ab * and * 2ba , 2bb * are actually pair - wise indistinguishable signifying that the effect of the impurity content is completely insignificant for somewhat larger rates of accretion . since , in the present work we concentrate only on demonstrating the effect of space - time curvature on the evolution of the magnetic field , @xmath41 is assumed for the rest of our calculations .",
    "we summarise the results of our investigation in the following plots . in fig.([fig02 ] ) we plot the evolution of the surface magnetic field for various densities of current concentration and for a fixed rate of mass accretion .",
    "it is clearly seen that the difference in final field values between that obtained using a flat and a curved space - time is @xmath42 1/4 orders of magnitude whereas that obtained by using two different densities for the initial current concentration could be as large as an order of magnitude .",
    "similarly in fig.([fig03 ] ) the difference in the final field values obtained using two different rates of accretion is much larger than any modification introduced by a general relativistic framework .",
    "since the values of the current concentration density or the rate of accretion used by us are well within the limits of observational uncertainty the inclusion / exclusion of a general relativistic framework does not really affect the calculation of the evolution of crustal magnetic field .",
    "+    in fig.s ( [ fig04 ] ) and ( [ fig05 ] ) we compare the effect of curved space - time for neutron stars of different masses and for different equations of state . the actual amount of field decay is more for a compact ( a stiffer equation of state or a larger mass ) star owing to a thinner crust and hence a smaller diffusive length - scale .",
    "but the modification due to general relativistic effects is larger for compact stars .",
    "that effect is discernible in fig.([fig05 ] ) .",
    "but the effect of a mass difference is rather insignificant as is seen in fig.([fig04 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted here that the crustal models used in our calculation ( described in section  [ sseos ] ) are somewhat older .",
    "the newer models predict lower crustal mass ( lorenz , ravenhall & pethick 1993 ) implying a higher surface red - shift for a given total mass of the star .",
    "it is evident from fig.([fig05 ] ) that such an effect is again small compared to other factors mentioned above .      to understand the effect of the curvature of space - time on the evolution of a purely crustal field we first define the characteristic diffusive and advective time - scales for eq.s ( [ e - dgdtf ] ) and ( [ e - dgdtc ] ) as follows : ^diff_flat & = & , + ^diff_curved & = & ( 1 - ) ^-1/2 , + ^adv_flat & = & , + ^adv_curved & = & . where @xmath43 is the length - scale associated with the underlying current distribution supporting the field",
    "the extra factor in @xmath44 for the curved space - time is , of course , the well known red - shift factor introducing an overall slow down compared to the case of a flat space - time . in table ( [ t - redshift ] ) we compare the values of the red - shift at the surfaces of the stars of different masses and for different equations of state .",
    "this factor is larger for a stiffer equation of state and for a larger mass - both of which makes the star more compact .",
    "but the numerical value of the red - shift factor is not very different from unity as can be seen from table ( [ t - redshift ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that in defining @xmath45 we have simply collected terms proportional to the first space derivatives of @xmath22 .",
    "hence , the extra term in the numerator of @xmath45 for the curved space - time is actually a modification to the diffusive part due to the curvature of space - time and not really a modification to the convective part .",
    "but this definition allows us to make upper bound estimates for the modifications to the final field values , due to the curvature of space - time , as described below .",
    "+     1.4 & 1.499 & 1.263 & 1.23 + 1.6 & & 1.322 & 1.278 + 1.8 & & 1.396 & 1.335 + 2.0 & & & 1.408 +    it is evident from the above definitions that : ^diff_flat",
    "< ^diff_curved ^adv_flat > ^adv_curved .",
    "this indicates that while the red - shift factor introduces an overall slow - down in the field evolution , the extra term , proportional to @xmath46 arising out of the curvature of space - time , accelerates the decay .",
    "therefore , the actual modification in the final surface field is given by the competition of these two effects . in order to make an estimate of this difference between the final surface field values obtained using a flat and a curved space - time ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath22 evolves in time with an approximate exponential behaviour with the above time - scales .",
    "in that case , the difference is obtained as : = = 1 - , for either diffusion or convection . before making estimates using the above definition",
    "we should note that the time evolution of @xmath22 does not really follow an exponential behaviour , particularly at late times .",
    "therefore , the estimates that we make using these time - scales are nothing but very crude upper limits . + for a star of mass 1.4  ( with an eos given by wff , with the currents concentrated initially at a density of @xmath47 and accreting at a rate of @xmath48   yr@xmath49we find that @xmath50 .",
    "this implies that , at most , we should see a difference of @xmath51 .",
    "consider curve 3 and 3a in fig.([fig02 ] ) ( which corresponds to these parameters ) .",
    "we see a difference of about half an order of magnitude ( before the curves level off and the effect of inner boundary condition of ` flux - freezing ' starts controlling the evolution ) which is close to @xmath52 of the corresponding value of the surface field and therefore within the upper limits estimated above .",
    "the actual difference between the final surface fields are , of course , much smaller and is closer to @xmath53 .",
    "from the results presented above we conclude that the effect of the curvature of space - time on the evolution of a crustal magnetic field of accreting neutron stars is quite small .",
    "to summarise : ithe difference in the final field strength obtained by using a general relativistic calculation is much smaller compared to the uncertainties already existing due to the plausible range of various crustal and binary evolution parameters ; ithe effect of curvature of space - time is larger for a stiffer equation of state or for a massive star but such differences are again quite insignificant .",
