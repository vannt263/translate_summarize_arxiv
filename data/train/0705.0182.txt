    "it has long been known that cooling by molecular hydrogen , @xmath6 , plays a major role in regulating star formation in primordial protogalaxies @xcite .",
    "the importance of @xmath6 stems from the fact that in most circumstances it is the dominant coolant in primordial gas at @xmath7 . as a result ,",
    "the chemistry of @xmath6 in primordial gas has attracted considerable study @xcite and it is now generally accepted that only a small chemical network , of maybe 2030 reactions , is required to model @xmath6 chemistry over a very wide range of conditions in these systems .    the introduction of metals into the gas , as will occur following enrichment of their surroundings by the first generation of supernovae , complicates matters enormously .",
    "many other atomic and molecular coolants become available and the associated chemistry is highly complex : for instance , a reasonably complex model of purely gas - phase chemistry can easily stretch to @xmath8 reactants and almost 4000 reactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this would not matter were it not for two important points .",
    "first , many astrophysicists believe that metal enrichment above a certain level  the so - called ` critical metallicity '  leads to a significant change in the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , from an imf dominated by massive stars to one that looks far more like the familiar salpeter imf of local star formation @xcite .",
    "second , testing this idea numerically using three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations requires us to model the chemistry of the gas , but the highly detailed chemical models mentioned above are impractical to use in high - resolution numerical simulations , owing to their high computational cost .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that chemical rate equations are frequently stiff and so for reasons of stability must be solved implicitly , with a computational cost that scales as the cube of the number of chemical species involved .",
    "it is therefore important to look for ways to simplify the chemistry without unduly compromising the accuracy of the resulting model .",
    "major simplifications can be made if we make the reasonable assumption that the main coolants in low metallicity , high redshift gas will be similar to those in the local interstellar medium  which should be true provided that the abundance ratios of the various metals in low metallicity gas are not _ too _ unusual  and also if we restrict the range of physical conditions in which we are interested .    in this paper , we present a chemical model designed to model the chemistry of the major coolants in cool ( @xmath9 ) low - metallicity gas at low gas densities . in the absence of ultraviolet radiation , and in gas with @xmath2 , our model is valid for atomic hydrogen number densities @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the size in myr of the characteristic physical timescale of interest in the problem , corresponding to an overdensity of @xmath10 with respect to the cosmological mean background density . at lower metallicities , or if a moderately strong uv field is present , our model remains accurate up to significantly higher densities .",
    "we do not treat the cooling or chemistry of hot gas ( @xmath11 ) as this has already been treated in detail elsewhere ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in  [ chem ]",
    "we present our simplified chemical network and discuss the principles determining our choice of reactants (  [ chem_choice ] ) and reactions (  [ react_select ] ) , as well as our treatment of grain surface chemistry (  [ surface_chem ] ) and photochemistry (  [ photochem ] ) . in ",
    "[ therm ] , we discuss our treatment of the main thermal processes included in our model , with a particular emphasis on atomic fine structure cooling .",
    "we conclude in  [ appl ] with a brief discussion of possible applications of our model .",
    "our choice of which chemical species to include in our simplified network was guided by two main considerations . in order to properly model the thermal evolution of the gas",
    ", we must be able to accurately model the evolution of the chemical abundances of all of the major coolants . at the same time , in order to keep our chemical treatment computationally efficient , we do not want to include more species than are strictly necessary . in some cases , the decision on whether or not to include a species was obvious .",
    "for instance , neutral atomic hydrogen , @xmath12 , is a major constituent of the gas and is also a major coolant at @xmath13 and above .",
    "molecular hydrogen , @xmath6 , also must be included as it has long been recognised to be the dominant coolant in metal - free gas at @xmath14 @xcite , and it is now clear that it also remains significant in metal - poor gas @xcite . a good case can also be made for the inclusion of @xmath15 , which dominates the cooling in zero - metallicity gas at @xmath16 @xcite , and which remains important at least up to metallicities @xmath17 @xcite . as far as metals go , however , the choice is less obvious .",
    "metal atoms and ions produce little in the way of resonance line cooling at @xmath7 , but many can act as sources of fine structure line emission or emission from metastable transitions at these temperatures . therefore , in order to determine which of the various species are important coolants in the region of parameter space that our model is designed to cover , we directly compared the cooling rates produced by each species , under the assumption that the relative abundances of the various elements were the same as in the local interstellar medium .",
    "the species we investigated in this comparison were the same as those included in the shock models of @xcite : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this list includes all of the neutral or singly ionized species that have both non - negligible abundances and emission lines that are accessible at @xmath7 .",
    "doubly ionized species are unlikely to be abundant in gas of this temperature , and so are unlikely to contribute significantly to the total cooling rate . atomic data for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath29 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 was taken from the sources listed in tables  [ fs_data][fs_coll_rates ] .",
    "for the remaining species , we used data taken from @xcite . for the relative abundances of c ,",
    "n , ne , ni , o , s and si , we used values taken from @xcite , while for cl we used a value taken from @xcite .",
    "we investigated three different scenarios for the ionization state of the gas , which we here refer to as the ` no ionization ' , ` moderate ionization ' and ` high ionization ' cases . in the no ionization case",
    ", we assumed that the gas was completely neutral , and so set the electron abundance to zero , along with the abundances of all of the ionized species . in the moderate ionization case",
    ", we assumed that the fractional ionization of hydrogen was such that @xmath37 , that species with ionization potentials lower than that of hydrogen  c , cl , fe , ni , s and si  were fully ionized , and that all of the other species remained fully neutral .",
    "finally , in the high ionization case , we assumed that @xmath38 , that species with ionization potentials lower than that of hydrogen were again fully ionized , and that the fractional ionization of the other species was the same as that of hydrogen , i.e.  50% .    in each case , we computed the cooling rate due to fine structure and/or metastable transitions from each of the listed species for a large number of temperatures in the interval @xmath39 and number densities in the interval @xmath40 . in these calculations , we assumed that the total metallicity of the gas was @xmath41 , and that the gas was optically thin in all of the relevant transitions .",
    "we also calculated the contributions to the total cooling rate made by lyman-@xmath42 emission and compton cooling ; the rate of the latter was calculated for an assumed redshift @xmath43 .",
    "we used the results of our comparison to select the set of major coolants that it was necessary to include in our thermal model by identifying all of the coolants that contributed more than 25% of the total cooling rate for any of the combinations of temperature , density and ionization that we examined . the resulting set consisted of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath29 , @xmath36 , compton cooling and lyman-@xmath42 cooling .",
    "therefore , the only metals that we include in our chemical and thermal model are carbon , oxygen and silicon .",
    "the importance of carbon and oxygen is unsurprising  they are well known to play a major role in the cooling of the local atomic ism @xcite , and previous authors have also predicted that they will play a key role at high redshift ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "silicon has attracted less attention ( although see @xcite ) , but @xmath36 proves to be the dominant coolant in highly ionized gas with @xmath44 at @xmath45 .",
    "although gas with the very high fractional ionization assumed here will recombine quickly at temperatures @xmath7 , it nevertheless seems prudent to include silicon in our model .",
    "moreover , since it is necessary to include neutral silicon in our chemical model if we are to calculate the @xmath36 abundance accurately , it requires little extra effort to include the effects of fine - structure cooling from .",
    "our choice of a 25% cutoff in this analysis is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "if we were to decrease the size of this cutoff , we would find that the number of species that must be included would increase , as both @xmath23 and s are important coolants at the 1020% level in portions of our parameter space .",
    "however , as the cooling rates of the dominant coolants often have uncertainties that are comparable to or larger than the size of the contributions from these minor coolants , the accuracy we would gain by including them is less than might be expected , and does not ( in our opinion ) justify the additional complexity and computational expense that would be required in order to treat them .    finally , it is clear that our conclusions here are sensitive to our choice of elemental abundance ratios .",
    "for instance , an increase in the iron abundance ( relative to the other metals ) of 12 orders of magnitude would render fe and @xmath23 important coolants in portions of our parameter space , necessitating their inclusion in our model .",
    "such an increase would be expected if the enrichment of the gas were dominated by pair - instability supernovae with masses close to the top end of the 140@xmath46 allowed mass range @xcite .",
    "however , studies of the abundance ratios found in extremely metal - poor stars in the galactic halo , which at present give us the best picture available of the elemental composition of very metal - poor gas , do not find evidence for significant enrichment by pair - instability supernovae ( see e.g.  the discussion in * ? ? ? * ) and so at the present time there is no compelling reason to include iron in our chemical model .",
    "our chemical model therefore consists of the eight coolants discussed above ",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath6 , @xmath15 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath29 , @xmath35 and @xmath36  together with ten additional species that play key roles in determining one or more of the abundances of the coolants : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "our rationale for including @xmath51 and @xmath52 in our model is that in the presence of a significant flux of hard uv photons , x - rays or cosmic rays , ionized helium can act as an important source of free electrons , and moreover can transfer charge to neutral carbon or silicon ( but not oxygen ) far more effectively than @xmath48 can",
    ".    we do not include minor primordial coolants such as @xmath57 or @xmath58 .",
    "these are never important at low densities and rarely important at high densities ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "more significantly , we do not include molecular coolants such as co or @xmath59 , assuming instead that the bulk of the carbon and oxygen in the gas remains in atomic or ionized form .",
    "this assumption dramatically simplifies the chemical modelling of the gas , but at the same time restricts the range of physical conditions over which the resulting model is useful .    to assess the conditions for which this approximation is justified , we need to know two things .",
    "first , what fraction of the available carbon and oxygen must be locked up in co or @xmath59 in order for cooling from these molecules to dominate over fine structure cooling ?",
    "second , under what conditions are these fractions achievable within a dynamically interesting timescale ? to answer the first of these questions , we have performed calculations using the treatment of carbon and oxygen fine structure cooling discussed in ",
    "[ fscool ] below , together with a table - based treatment of co and @xmath59 taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have computed @xmath60 , defined as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the cooling rate per unit volume due to species @xmath63 , for a wide range of temperatures and densities .",
    "we assume that @xmath64 and that all of the cooling occurs in the optically thin regime .",
    "we adopt a nominal redshift @xmath43 and consider only temperatures @xmath65 , under the assumption that heating from the cmb will prevent the gas from cooling appreciably below this temperature . in figure",
    "[ fmol ] , we show how @xmath60 varies as a function of temperature and density .",
    "figure  [ fmol ] demonstrates that over most of the parameter space that we have examined , @xmath60 is of order unity .",
    "we find that @xmath66 only for temperatures very close to the cmb temperature ( which is likely an numerical artifact , a result of the fact that our treatment of fine structure cooling includes the effects of radiative pumping by the cmb , while our treatment of co and @xmath59 cooling does not ) , and at high densities , where the level populations of the fine structure coolants start to reach their local thermodynamic equilibrium values , causing the fine structure cooling rate per atom to saturate . for co or @xmath59",
    "cooling to be effective , we therefore require that about as many carbon and oxygen atoms be incorporated into molecules as remain in atomic form .    with these values of @xmath60 in hand , we can now turn to the question of whether it is possible to produce enough co and @xmath59 in the gas within an interesting timescale .",
    "since we require a significant amount of oxygen to be in the form of coolant molecules , the timescale of interest , @xmath67 , is given approximately by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the net rate of formation of coolants per unit volume .",
    "therefore , to estimate @xmath67 we must first estimate @xmath69 .",
    "although a complete discussion of the formation and destruction mechanisms of co and @xmath59 in low metallicity gas is beyond the scope of this paper , we will briefly summarize the most important points . in hot gas ( @xmath70 ) , most co and water molecules form via reaction pathways initiated by the hydroxyl radical",
    ", oh ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is formed by @xmath71 but most is then destroyed by @xmath72 however , a small fraction instead reacts to form other molecular species , such as water or co , e.g.@xmath73 the resulting @xmath59 and co molecules can be destroyed by collisions with atomic hydrogen : @xmath74 if , as will generally be the case in low - metallicity gas , @xmath75 ( where @xmath76 is the fractional abundance of @xmath6 relative to the total number of hydrogen nuclei ) , then the destruction of water by reaction  [ water1 ] is far more effective than its formation by reaction  [ ohd2 ] , and water will never account for more than a small fraction of the available oxygen . on the other hand ,",
    "the co formed by reaction  [ ohd3 ] can potentially account for almost all of the available oxygen or carbon  whichever is present in the smaller amount  as the destruction of co by reaction  [ cod1 ] is ineffective at @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , the net rate of formation of coolant molecules ( primarily @xmath78 ) is given approximately by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the rate coefficient of reaction @xmath63 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the fractional abundances of atomic hydrogen and atomic carbon , and @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the number densities of @xmath29 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "the timescale to convert significant quantities of oxygen to co is then given approximately by @xmath85 for @xmath86 , which is a reasonable value for low metallicity gas if @xmath6 formation on dust is unimportant , this gives a timescale of approximately @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei , and where we have adopted the values for the various rate coefficients that are given in @xcite .",
    "in cold gas , all of these reactions ( except for reaction  [ ohd3 ] ) are ineffective , and other processes dominate the formation of water and co. a good summary of the relevant chemistry is given in @xcite . when @xmath89 , the most important mechanism involves the formation of the @xmath90 ion via the rapid ion - neutral reaction @xmath91",
    "if @xmath92 , then most of the resulting @xmath90 ions simply dissociatively recombine : @xmath93 otherwise , they can then react further with @xmath6 to give @xmath94 and @xmath95 , with dissociative recombination of the latter producing @xmath96 and water .",
    "co formation follows through reaction  [ ohd3 ] .",
    "all of these reactions occur rapidly , and so the net rate of formation of coolant molecules is given by the rate of formation of @xmath90 multiplied by the fraction of @xmath90 that is not destroyed by dissociative recombination , ( 1 - @xmath97 : @xmath98 for @xmath99 , we have @xmath100 , and hence @xmath101 . in that case , the time required to convert most of the oxygen to @xmath90 and thence to other molecules is @xmath102 where we have used the fact that @xmath103 owing to the rapid transfer of charge between oxygen and hydrogen ( see  [ metal_chem ] below ) . if we assume that @xmath104 and that @xmath86 , then this gives us a value for @xmath67 of @xmath105 decreasing the fractional ionization of the gas will increase @xmath67 , but increasing it will have no significant effect .",
    "finally , if the fractional ionization of the gas is too low for reaction  [ ohpf ] to operate effectively , then the formation of coolant molecules again occurs primarily via hydroxyl , which in this case is formed mainly by direct radiative association @xcite @xmath106 in this case , @xmath67 is simply @xmath107    comparing the three values of @xmath67 derived above , we see that in gas with @xmath2 , @xmath108 , regardless of the gas temperature , provided that @xmath109 and that the fractional ionization satisfies the constraint given above .",
    "if we compare this with the characteristic physical timescale of the problem of interest , @xmath4 , then it is simple to show that for densities @xmath110 co and @xmath59 will not form in quantities large enough to dominate the cooling , and hence it is valid to ignore these molecules and all of their associated chemistry .",
    "note also that if we were to include the effects of photodissociation of @xmath96 , @xmath59 and co in the above analysis , then this would push the required density to an even larger value .    in a gravitationally collapsing protogalaxy ,",
    "a reasonable value for @xmath4 is the gravitational free - fall timescale @xmath111 , and in this scenario , our neglect of the molecular chemistry is valid as long as @xmath112 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we want to simulate the thermal evolution of the interstellar medium in a metal - poor dwarf galaxy , a more reasonable timescale may be the sound - crossing time of the disk , which is of order @xmath113 for a @xmath114 disk and a sound speed of @xmath115 . in this case ,",
    "our model is valid only for @xmath116 .    as a consistency check on our conclusions here",
    ", we examined the results of @xcite , who model the thermal and chemical evolution of freely - falling gas at a range of metallicities far below solar , using a detailed treatment of the gas chemistry .",
    "they find that for @xmath117 , significant conversion of carbon and oxygen to molecular form does not occur until @xmath118 , in line with the value derived here . at lower metallicities ,",
    "an even higher gas density is required . as another check ,",
    "we have computed the evolution of the @xmath78 and @xmath59 abundances in the gas at the center of several of the simulated protogalactic halos discussed in @xcite  ( 2007 ; hereafter paper ii ) , using values for the density , temperature , @xmath6 abundance and @xmath48 abundance taken from our simulations , and modelling the chemistry with the full umist99 chemical network @xcite .",
    "we find that in most of these runs , our neglect of the molecular coolants is justified , as their abundances never become large enough for them to significantly affect the cooling .",
    "our approximation begins to break down in the runs with @xmath2 , where about 10%20% of the total carbon and oxygen are incorporated into co and @xmath59 , which is just enough to affect the cooling at high temperatures and/or high densities .",
    "however , only in our runs with @xmath119 does it break down completely .",
    "therefore , the use of our highly simplified chemical model would appear to be justified in low - density gas with @xmath120 .",
    "we are thus left with a set of eighteen chemical species that must be modelled : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath12 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath6 , @xmath54 , @xmath53 , @xmath15 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath29 , @xmath55 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath56 .",
    "the combined evolution of the abundances of these species is described by a chemical network consisting of 74 reactions : 47 collisional gas - phase reactions ( summarized in table  [ tab : chem_gas_coll ] ) , 12 photochemical gas - phase reactions ( summarized in table  [ tab : chem_gas_photo ] ) , 7 grain surface reactions ( summarized in table  [ tab : chem_grain ] ) , and 8 reactions involving cosmic rays ( summarized in table  [ tab : cosmic ] ) .",
    "the abundances of these species are also constrained by seven conservation laws : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the fractional abundance of chemical species @xmath63 relative to the total abundance of hydrogen nuclei , and where @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 are the total abundances of deuterium , helium , carbon , oxygen and silicon , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we assume in our modelling that @xmath49 and @xmath50 are in chemical equilibrium , allowing us to write their abundances as : @xmath128 and @xmath129 where @xmath88 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei .",
    "this assumption is generally justified in simulations of the cooling and gravitational collapse of gas in protogalactic halos , as the timescales on which @xmath49 and @xmath50 reach chemical equilibrium are much shorter than the cooling or free - fall timescale .",
    "( for a more detailed discussion of this point , see @xcite ) .",
    "the constraints represented by equations  [ chg_cons][eq_h2p ] allow us to reduce the total number of chemical rate equations that must be solved to only nine . in practice",
    ", we generally choose to solve for the abundances of the ionized species ( @xmath48 , @xmath54 , @xmath52 , @xmath19 , @xmath55 , @xmath36 , @xmath56 ) , @xmath6 and @xmath15 , but alternative choices are possible and would not significantly alter the results obtained .",
    "the number of chemical reactions that could be included in our chemical network is very large , despite the limited number of chemical species involved .",
    "fortunately , many of these reactions have little or no impact on the evolution of the abundances of our main coolants and so the number of reactions that need to be included in our chemical network remains reasonably small .",
    "we can divide the reactions that must be included into two subsets .",
    "the first subset consists of the reactions required to model the chemistry of hydrogen , helium and deuterium , including the formation and destruction of @xmath6 and @xmath15 ( reactions 129 , 4855 , 6063 , 6770 ) .",
    "the second subset consists of the reactions required to model the carbon , oxygen and silicon chemistry ( reactions 3047 , 5659 , 6466 , 7174 ) .",
    "the amount of @xmath48 present in the gas is controlled by seven main reactions : collisional ionization of @xmath12 by electrons ( reaction 11 ) , charge transfer with helium ( reactions 26 & 27 ) , photoionization ( reaction 48 ) , cosmic ray ionization ( reaction 67 ) , gas - phase recombination ( reaction 13 ) and recombination on the surface of dust grains ( reaction 61 ) . similar reactions ( nos .  12 , 28 , 29 , 49 , 68 , 14 & 62 ) partially determine the @xmath54 abundance , but in this case , charge transfer to and from hydrogen ( reactions 18 & 19 ) is also of great importance , owing to the very large abundance of hydrogen relative to deuterium . finally , the @xmath52 abundance is controlled primarily by collisional ionization ( reaction 24 ) ,",
    "photoionization ( reaction 50 ) , cosmic ray ionization ( reaction 69 ) , gas - phase and grain - surface recombination ( reactions 25 & 63 ) and charge transfer with hydrogen ( reactions 26 & 27 ) .",
    "the remaining 24 reactions in this subset control the formation and destruction of @xmath6 and @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath6 forms in the gas phase via the intermediate ions @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( reactions 2 & 4 ) , as well as on the surface of dust grains ( reaction 60 ) .",
    "it is destroyed by collisions with @xmath48 , @xmath47 , @xmath12 and @xmath6 ( reactions 710 ) , and can also be photodissociated or photoionized by uv radiation ( reactions 53 & 54 ) , or ionized by cosmic rays ( reaction 70 ) .",
    "collisions with @xmath51 @xcite @xmath130 and @xmath52 @xcite @xmath131 can also destroy @xmath6 , but in general these processes are not as effective as collisions with hydrogen , and so they can be omitted from our simplified chemical model without significantly affecting its accuracy .",
    "the @xmath49 and @xmath50 ions required for gas - phase @xmath6 formation are formed primarily by the radiative association of atomic hydrogen with free electrons or protons respectively ( reactions 1 & 3 ) , and while reactions 2 & 4 generally dominate the removal of @xmath49 and @xmath50 from the gas , in hot or highly ionized gas a number of other processes become competitive ( reactions 5 , 6 & 15 - 17 ) photodissocation of @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( reactions 51 & 52 ) can also become important if the incident radiation field is strong .    finally , although @xmath15 can form from intermediate ions such as @xmath132 or @xmath133 in a manner analogous to @xmath6 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most actually forms from @xmath6 via reaction 20 : @xmath134 the resulting @xmath15 can be destroyed by the inverse of this reaction ( reaction 21 ) , or by photodissociation ( reaction 55 ) . in hot gas , the @xmath15 abundance is also influenced by reactions between @xmath6 and @xmath53 and @xmath15 and @xmath12 ( nos .",
    "22 & 23 respectively ) .",
    "note that with the exception of the grain surface reactions ( which are discussed in  [ surface_chem ] below ) , the reactions required to model the hydrogen , helium and deuterium chemistry accurately in metal - enriched gas are just the same as those required to model primordial gas .",
    "the values for many of these rate coefficients are known to within a small amount of uncertainty at the temperatures and densities of interest , and so our choice of the particular values used here should be uncontroversial .",
    "however , a few of our assumptions demand further comment .",
    "first , we note that the rates listed for reactions involving @xmath6 or @xmath15 as a reactant generally assume that these molecules are not vibrationally excited .",
    "this assumption is reasonable at the low densities treated here , but breaks down at densities @xmath135 .",
    "second , we note that for several reactions involving deuterium where no readily available rate coefficient exists in the astrophysical literature , we have assumed that the rate is the same as for the analogous reaction involving @xmath12 or @xmath48 .",
    "the rates of processes involving cosmic rays ( see table  [ tab : cosmic ] ) depend on the energy spectrum and energy density of cosmic rays .",
    "these are poorly known at the relevant energies even in the local ism , and far less is known concerning high - redshift cosmic rays . for this reason",
    ", we do not give absolute values for these rates , but instead parameterize them in terms of the cosmic ray ionization rate for atomic hydrogen , @xmath136 , which can then be considered an adjustable parameter of the model .",
    "finally , we note that two of the reactions that regulate the @xmath49 abundance have large uncertainties in their rate coefficients .",
    "the reactions in question are the associative detachment of @xmath49 with @xmath12 ( reaction 2 ) and the mutual neutralization of @xmath49 with @xmath48 ( reaction 5 ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the uncertainties in the rates of both of these reactions may be as large as an order of magnitude . in gas with a high fractional ionization , this uncertainty can lead to a significant uncertainty in the @xmath6 formation rate and in the final @xmath6 fractional abundance , particularly in the presence of a strong ultraviolet background radiation field . in the chemical model presented here",
    ", we have followed @xcite and have adopted a rate coefficient for reaction 2 taken from @xcite and a rate coefficient for reaction 5 taken from @xcite .",
    "however , we caution the reader that this should not be regarded as an endorsement of the accuracy of these particular values .      as discussed in  [ chem_choice ] above , we do not include the molecular chemistry of these elements in this simplified model .",
    "our treatment of the carbon , oxygen and silicon chemistry is therefore purely a treatment of the charge balance of these species .",
    "we begin with oxygen , in many respects the simplest of the three to treat .",
    "the ionization potential of neutral oxygen is only 0.02  ev larger than that of neutral hydrogen , and so charge transfer between @xmath55 and @xmath12 or @xmath48 and @xmath29 ( reactions 36 & 37 ) occurs rapidly .",
    "since the hydrogen abundance is orders of magnitude larger than the oxygen abundance , this means that the ratio of ionized to neutral oxygen is controlled by the ratio of ionized to neutral hydrogen , i.e.  that @xmath137 in most circumstances , reactions 36 & 37 are the only reactions required in order to accurately model the oxygen chemistry . nevertheless ,",
    "for completeness we also include several other processes : radiative recombination ( reaction 32 ) , grain surface recombination ( reaction 65 ) , collisional ionization ( reaction 35 ) , charge transfer with @xmath52 ( reaction 38 ) , photoionization ( reaction 57 ) and cosmic ray ionization ( reaction 72 ) .",
    "in the case of carbon , the situation is rather different .",
    "first , charge transfer from @xmath48 to @xmath18 ( reaction 39 ) is much less effective than charge transfer from @xmath48 to @xmath29 , and so reaction 39 plays a far less important role in the carbon chemistry than reaction 37 does in the oxygen chemistry .",
    "second , carbon has an ionization potential of only 11.26  ev .",
    "this means that charge transfer from @xmath19 to @xmath12 is significantly endothermic , rendering it unimportant at @xmath7 ( although we include it here for completeness ) .",
    "it also means that neutral carbon can be photoionized by ultraviolet photons with wavelengths @xmath138   , which can penetrate easily into low metallicity protogalactic gas .",
    "consequently , photoionization of @xmath18 ( reaction 56 ) plays an important role in the carbon chemistry , whereas photoionization of @xmath55 is unimportant outside of @xmath139 regions .",
    "in addition to charge transfer and photoionization , ionized carbon can also be produced by collisional ionization ( reaction 33 ) , although this is important only for temperatures @xmath140 , by charge transfer with @xmath52 ( reaction 41 ) and by cosmic ray ionization ( reaction 71 ) .",
    "@xmath19 is removed from the gas primarily by recombination in the gas phase ( reaction 30 ) and on grain surfaces ( reaction 64 ) , although if the free electron abundance is small , charge transfer from @xmath19 to @xmath35 ( reaction 44 ) can also become important .    in the case of silicon , a similar set of processes operate : collisional ionization ( reaction 34 ) , cosmic ray ionization ( reaction 73 ) , gas - phase recombination ( reaction 31 ) , grain surface recombination ( reaction 66 ) , charge transfer from @xmath48 , @xmath52 or @xmath19 to @xmath35 ( reactions 42 , 43 & 44 ) , and photoionization by an ultraviolet radiation field ( reaction 58 ) , assuming one is present . in the case of silicon , however , we also include the doubly ionized ion , @xmath56 , in our chemical model , since this can be produced by charge transfer from @xmath48 to @xmath36 ( reaction 45 ) with an endothermicity of only a few ev , rendering it potentially important at temperatures @xmath141 .",
    "it can also be produced by photoionization ( reaction 59 ) , although in this case the 16.35  ev energy requirement renders this process important only within regions , or by cosmic ray ionization ( reaction 74 ) .",
    "the @xmath56 produced by these processes can be destroyed by charge transfer with neutral hydrogen ( reaction 46 ) , or by recombination ( reaction 47 ) .    regarding the accuracy of our adopted reaction rates , we note that while many have well determined rate coefficients , there are two notable exceptions .",
    "the only available rate coefficients for reactions 43 and 44 , which involve the transfer of charge from @xmath52 to @xmath35 and from @xmath19 to @xmath35 respectively , assume that the reactions both proceed at the langevin rate . in practice ,",
    "highly exothermic charge transfer reactions often proceed at a rate far below the simple langevin rate , and so the rates of these reactions may be overestimated in our model .",
    "if dust grains are present in the metal - enriched gas , then our chemical model must account for the effects of reactions occurring on the surface of the grains , as these reactions are often far more effective than their gas - phase counterparts .",
    "we therefore include a small number of grain surface reactions in our model , as summarized in table  [ tab : chem_grain ] .",
    "the only grain surface reaction between neutral species that is included in our model is the formation of molecular hydrogen ( reaction 60 ) .",
    "this is a hugely important reaction in the local interstellar medium , since at typical interstellar densities it is the only process capable of producing the large quantities of molecular hydrogen that are directly observed ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or inferred from other molecular tracers , such as co. theoretical modeling @xcite suggests that it remains important down to metallicities of order @xmath142 , within the range of applicability for the chemical model presented here .    the rate that we adopt for this process is based on the widely used rate of @xcite .",
    "this was derived for solar metallicity gas , assuming a distribution of grain sizes as given in @xcite , and to adapt it for use in low metallicity gas , we simply assume that the rate scales linearly with the metallicity @xmath143 .",
    "the validity of this assumption is open to question , as many of the features of the grain population , such as the grain size distribution or the mix of compositions , may differ greatly between milky way dust and protogalactic dust .",
    "an alternative , physically motivated approach would be to adopt a grain size distribution and mix of compositions based on the results of numerical modeling of dust formation in high redshift supernovae @xcite and then to compute the @xmath6 formation rate expected for this grain population .",
    "this is the approach used by @xcite .",
    "however , the uncertainties associated with this approach are considerable . to begin with ,",
    "the predictions of the numerical models are highly sensitive to the degree of mixing assumed to occur within the supernova ejecta @xcite . in addition , dust destruction in the reverse shock is typically not taken into account in these models , and to the best of our knowledge , the amount of dust that survives the passage of the shock has yet to be fully quantified ( although research in this area is actively proceeding ; r. schneider , priv .",
    "finally , the changes wrought on the grain population by subsequent processing in the interstellar medium or intergalactic medium ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are not fully understood . in light of these uncertainties",
    ", we do not believe that this approach currently offers much of an advantage over our simple assumption of an @xmath6 formation rate that scales with metallicity .",
    "we do not include any neutral - neutral surface reactions in our model other than @xmath6 formation .",
    "for neutral - neutral surface reactions to be able to significantly affect the ability of the gas to cool , they must be able to alter the abundances of neutral carbon , oxygen or silicon by a substantial amount .",
    "we can place an upper limit on the rate at which these reactions occur if we assume that the reaction probability @xmath144 , i.e.  that every collision between a metal atom and a grain results in a reaction . in that case , the reaction rate per unit volume for an atomic species @xmath63 is given by @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the thermal velocity of atomic species @xmath63 , and @xmath147 is the total surface area of grains per unit volume of gas . for milky way dust of the type assumed by @xcite , @xmath148 , where @xmath88 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei . at lower metallicity",
    ", our assumption that the grain size distribution does not change with metallicity implies that the value of @xmath147 in gas with a metallicity @xmath149 is simply @xmath150 .",
    "we can therefore rewrite equation  [ grain_rate ] as @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the mass of species @xmath63 in atomic mass units .",
    "the corresponding conversion timescale @xmath153 is then @xmath154 if @xmath155 , then this expression becomes : @xmath156 if we equate this to a characteristic physical timescale @xmath4 , then we can show that @xmath157 as long as @xmath158 for gas with a temperature @xmath159 and metallicity @xmath2 , and with atomic carbon as the colliding species , this gives : @xmath160 at higher temperatures , the limiting @xmath88 will be slightly smaller , but at @xmath161 , collisional dissociation of most molecular species is highly effective , and so in this temperature regime , grain surface reactions are unlikely to be important .    from this analysis",
    ", we see that even if @xmath144 , neutral - neutral grain surface reactions are unimportant at gas densities @xmath162 . in gravitationally collapsing gas with @xmath163 ,",
    "this corresponds to @xmath164 . note that a key point here is that for neutral - neutral grain surface reactions involving our atomic coolants ( c , o etc . ) to significantly affect the thermal behaviour of the gas , a large fraction of the total number of coolant atoms must react , whereas for grain surface reactions to affect the @xmath6 cooling rate by significantly altering the @xmath6 abundance , only a small fraction of the total number of hydrogen atoms must react .",
    "this means that in the case of @xmath6 , the relevant conversion timescale is several orders of magnitude shorter , and hence our density limit would be significantly smaller if we were to omit grain surface @xmath6 formation from our model .",
    "one way in which this simple analysis could break down is if @xmath165 were much larger for reactions involving the coolant atoms than for @xmath6 formation .",
    "however , a recent analysis of @xmath6 formation on grain surfaces by @xcite that takes both physisorbed ( i.e.  van der waals bonded ) and chemisorbed ( i.e.chemically bonded ) hydrogen into account demonstrates that in the conditions of interest in this paper , @xmath166 ( with the result that the computed @xmath6 formation rate is very similar to the widely - used rate of @xcite that is used in our model ) . a comparable analysis has not been performed for reactions involving c , o or si , but clearly they can not have @xmath167 , and so there is little scope for these reactions to occur significantly faster than @xmath6 formation .    finally , we include in our surface chemistry model six important reactions involving ions : the recombination of @xmath48 , @xmath54 , @xmath52 , @xmath19 , @xmath55 and @xmath36 with electrons on the surface of grains . as grain surface recombination is a non - radiative process , it proceeds at a much faster rate than radiative recombination in the gas phase .",
    "moreover , if a typical grain is negatively charged , then the effective cross - section for collisions will be much enhanced over the geometric cross - section due to coloumb focussing .",
    "grain charging is largely determined by the parameter @xcite @xmath168 where @xmath169 is a measure of the radiation energy density between @xmath170 and @xmath171 relative to the @xcite field .",
    "when @xmath172 is small , most grains are negatively charged , and so in these conditions grain surface recombination can be important even if neutral - neutral grain surface reactions are unimportant .    to model grain surface recombination , we follow @xcite .",
    "we adopt their rate coefficients for the recombination of @xmath48 , @xmath52 , @xmath19 and @xmath36 . for @xmath55 and @xmath54",
    ", we use the facts that @xmath55 and @xmath54 have almost the same ionization potential as @xmath48 and that the ion arrival rate at the grain scales as @xmath173 ( where @xmath152 is the mass of the ion in atomic mass units ) to derive rates by appropriately scaling the @xmath48 rate .",
    "the @xcite rates were all computed for milky way dust , and to adapt them for use in low metallicity gas , we again assume that they scale linearly with @xmath143 , with the same caveats as before .",
    "in table  [ tab : chem_gas_photo ] , we list the cross - sections for all but two of the photochemical reactions included in our model .",
    "the two exceptions are @xmath6 photodissociation and @xmath15 photodissociation , which are caused by absorption in a large number of discrete spectral lines , and which are discussed separately in  [ h2_photodiss ] below .    given the cross - section , @xmath174 , the corresponding photochemical rate can be obtained from @xmath175 { \\rm d}e\\ ] ] where @xmath176 is the photon energy , @xmath177 is the energy threshold , @xmath178 and @xmath179 are the mean intensity ( in units of @xmath180 ) and optical depth for a photon of energy @xmath176 ( both of which are problem dependent ) , and where @xmath181 is a factor that accounts for the effects of secondary ionizations .",
    "it is generally a reasonable approximation to set @xmath182 unless the ionizing component of the radiation field is dominated by x - rays @xcite . in the case that x - rays dominate ,",
    "fits for @xmath181 for @xmath12 and @xmath51 photoionization as a function of the fractional ionization of the gas can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the effects of secondary ionizations on the other processes listed here are generally negligible , owing to the large abundances of neutral @xmath12 and @xmath51 relative to all other species .",
    "if the gas is optically thick at the @xmath51 photoionization threshold , then an additional process that must be taken into account is the photoionization of @xmath12 by the diffuse emission produced by @xmath52 recombination . in the limit of high optical depth ,",
    "the on - the - spot approximation applies , and we can model this process as a local ionization rate with a value @xcite @xmath183 n_{\\rm e } n_{{\\rm{he}^{+ } } } \\ : { \\rm cm^{-3 } } \\ : { \\rm s^{-1}},\\ ] ] where @xmath184 is given by @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the @xmath51 ionization threshold .",

    "if the on - the - spot approximation does not apply , then the radiative transfer of this diffuse emission must be modelled in some fashion .",
    "however , a discussion of appropriate techniques for doing so lies well beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in some circumstances it may also be necessary to take account of the photodissociation of @xmath49 and @xmath50 by photons produced by ionized hydrogen and helium ( both recombination emission and bremsstrahlung ) .",
    "this process is generally important only in neutral gas close to a significant volume of dense , ionized gas ( e.g.  in the neutral gas immediately surrounding an expanding ionization front ) .",
    "it is discussed in detail in @xcite and so we do not discuss it further here .    finally , we note that for each of the photoionization or photodissociation rates listed in table  [ tab : chem_gas_photo ] , there is a corresponding photoheating rate , given by @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the energy of the primary photoelectron and @xmath191 gives the fraction of this energy converted to heat , which can be calculated using the results of @xcite or @xcite . in practice , photoheating from the photoionization of @xmath12 and @xmath51 usually dominates over the other contributions by a wide margin .",
    "although the binding energy of @xmath6 is only 4.48  ev , photons of this energy are not able to dissociate @xmath6 effectively , as the simplest dissociative transition  excitation to the vibrational continuum of the ground state  is strongly forbidden  @xcite .",
    "transitions to the repulsive b@xmath192 state , the least energetic of the excited electronic states of @xmath6 , are also forbidden , and so photodissociation takes place primarily through excitation to the lyman ( b@xmath193 ) or werner ( c@xmath194 ) electronic states followed by radiative decay to the vibrational continuum of the ground state . as a number of vibrational levels",
    "are accessible in each excited state , photodissociation takes place through a number of discrete absorption lines , known as the lyman and werner band systems @xcite .    in optically thin gas",
    ", the photodissociation rate can be written as @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the fraction of @xmath6 molecules that have vibrational and rotational quantum numbers @xmath197 in the electronic ground state , and @xmath198 is the photodissociation rate due to transitions out of @xmath197 .",
    "the latter can be written as @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the pumping rate from level @xmath197 in the electronic ground state to level @xmath201 in either the lyman or werner states , @xmath202 is the fraction of decays from @xmath203 which end in the vibrational continuum of the ground state ( rather than back in some bound state ) , and where we sum over all accessible levels . given appropriate molecular data , calculation of @xmath204 is straightforward for each bound level @xmath197 in the electronic ground state . to then calculate @xmath205 , one also needs to know the level populations @xmath196 .    if we assume that the mean intensity @xmath206 is independent of energy , and that all of the @xmath6 is in the @xmath207 level ( i.e.  the para - hydrogen ground state ) , then @xmath205 evaluates to @xmath208 where we have made use of molecular data taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this expression remains a good approximation in the more general case that @xmath209 is allowed to vary with frequency , provided that the variations are not too extreme and that we replace @xmath209 in equation  [ h2_thin_flat ] with @xmath210 , where @xmath211 @xcite : @xmath212 relaxing the assumption that all of the @xmath6 has @xmath213 also makes little difference to @xmath205 @xcite .",
    "vibrational excitation of the @xmath6 makes a much larger difference @xcite , but at low gas densities we would expect the populations of the vibrational levels of @xmath6 to be very small .",
    "equation  [ h2_thin ] therefore gives a reasonable estimate of the optically thin @xmath6 photodissociation rate within the regions of parameter space for which our chemical model is valid .",
    "if enough @xmath6 is present in the gas , then the lyman - werner lines can become optically thick , leading to a reduction in the @xmath6 photodissociation rate , an effect known as @xmath6 self - shielding .",
    "if the gas is at rest , then the effects of @xmath6 self - shielding can be treated quite accurately using the prescription of @xcite .",
    "they parameterize the self - shielding with a shielding function @xmath214 , defined to be the ratio of the @xmath6 photodissociation rate in self - shielded gas to the rate in optically thin gas .",
    "they demonstrate how to calculate @xmath214 as a function of the gas temperature and the @xmath6 column density and also construct the following useful fitting function : @xmath215 , \\label{db_fsh}\\ ] ] where @xmath216 , @xmath217 is the @xmath6 column density , @xmath218 and @xmath219 is the doppler broadening parameter .",
    "although @xcite assume a semi - inifinite slab geometry in their models , their approach is easy to extend to more complicated geometries .    unfortunately , their simple treatment breaks down in gas which is not at rest .",
    "doppler shifts due to the motions of the gas cause @xmath6 in different regions to absorb at slightly different wavelengths , and if these doppler shifts are comparable to or larger than the thermal linewidth of the gas ( as will be the case in transonic or supersonic gas respectively ) , then the effect is to reduce the amount of self - shielding that occurs .",
    "an accurate treatment of @xmath6 self - shielding in this regime probably requires one to solve the full frequency - dependent transport equation , which can not currently be done in a computationally efficient manner within a three - dimensional hydrodynamics code .",
    "consequently , various different approximations have been used to study @xmath6 photodissociation in this regime .",
    "the simplest approach is to ignore self - shielding entirely ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is a good approximation if the velocities in the gas are large and the @xmath6 column densities are small , but otherwise will significantly overestimate the photodissociation rate . at the other extreme , one can ignore the effects of doppler shifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is a good approximation if the @xmath6 column density is sufficiently large ( @xmath220 ) that the lorentz wings of the lyman - werner line profiles dominate the line widths , as in this case the line widths will be much larger than any likely doppler shifts within the molecular gas . on the other hand , this approach will underestimate the true photodissociation rate when @xmath221 , as is the case in many interesting low - metallicity systems .",
    "another approximation has recently been suggested by @xcite .",
    "they use equation  ( [ db_fsh ] ) to compute @xmath214 , but adopt a value for @xmath219 that includes both a thermal contribution and one arising due to the velocity dispersion of the gas . in practice , this means that they treat their @xmath6 as having an effective @xmath219 equivalent to that in a purely thermal gas with @xmath222 .",
    "the accuracy of this approximation depends on the correlation length of the velocity field .",
    "if this is small compared to the other length scales of interest , then treating the velocity dispersion in this fashion is reasonable and should give a fairly accurate result .",
    "on the other hand , if the velocity field is dominated by large - scale bulk motions ( such as infall into a protogalaxy ) , then this approximation will be significantly less accurate .",
    "finally , in @xcite and in paper ii , we use a local approximation in which only the @xmath6 within a single sph smoothing length is assumed to contribute to the shielding ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a grid - based version of this approach ) .",
    "this fairly crude approximation is intended to take account of the fact that @xmath6 close to a given point of interest is more likely to have only a small relative velocity than gas a large distance away .",
    "it will generally underestimate the amount of self - shielding , but nevertheless represents an improvement over neglecting self - shielding entirely . aside from its inevitable inaccuracy , this approximation also suffers from the disadvantage of being resolution dependent , as increasing the number of sph particles in the simulation will generally decrease all of the sph smoothing lengths and hence will cause a systematic increase in @xmath214 . on the other hand , it has the significant advantages of being computationally efficient ( as only local data is required ) as well as being very easy to implement .    to sum up ,",
    "a number of different approximate methods exist for treating @xmath6 self - shielding in large numerical simulations , but none are entirely satisfying .",
    "further work on this problem is definitely called for .",
    "turning now to @xmath15 , we note that @xmath15 photodissociation in optically thin gas can be treated in much the same way as @xmath6 photodissociation .",
    "the necessary molecular data for @xmath15 can be found in @xcite , and the resulting photodissociation rate for a radiation field with a flat spectrum can be written as @xmath223 which is only @xmath224 larger than the @xmath6 rate . above an hd column density @xmath225 , self - shielding of the hd lines significantly reduces the photodissociation rate . for a static gas",
    ", this process can again be modeled using the approach of @xcite , although the same problems arise when one tries to extend this approach to a gas distribution which is not static .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath15 , we face an additional complication : if the @xmath15 column density is sufficiently high for hd self - shielding to be significant , then the @xmath6 column density will be very much larger ( since even in significantly fractionated regions , one typically has an hd:@xmath6 ratio of no more than about @xmath226 ) .",
    "consequently , the line widths of the @xmath6 lyman - werner lines are not negligible , and some degree of overlap between these lines and the hd absorption lines will occur . additionally , if the @xmath6:h ratio is small , as will often be the case in the systems of interest , then a significant hd column density implies a large neutral hydrogen column density , which means that absorption of radiation in the lyman series lines of atomic hydrogen must also be taken into account .",
    "these effects are difficult to include accurately in a simple treatment of hd self - shielding and before attempting to do so it is reasonable to ask whether an accurate treatment of hd self - shielding is really required .",
    "we argue that in many cases of interest it is not .",
    "comparison of the rate at which @xmath15 is photodissociated in optically thin gas with the rate at which it is destroyed by reaction 21 demonstrates that the latter dominates whenever @xmath227 , where @xmath228 is the strength of the radiation field at @xmath211 in units of @xmath229 .",
    "photodissociation therefore dominates only when the uv field is strong or the proton number density is small .",
    "however , in either case , it is difficult to see how the large column densities of hd and @xmath6 required for effective shielding could be built up or maintained .",
    "therefore , we suspect that for most applications , treating the hd in the optically thin limit is probably sufficient , as in the conditions where this approximation breaks down , photodissociation is unlikely to be important .",
    "as we do not include molecular coolants such as co or @xmath59 in our chemical model of metal - enriched gas , for the reasons outlined in  [ chem_choice ] , the main contribution that the metals make to the cooling of the gas is through fine structure line emission from neutral @xmath18 , @xmath29 and @xmath35 atoms and @xmath19 and @xmath36 ions . to model this emission , we assume that the populations of all the electronically excited levels of these atoms and ions are negligible , an approximation which should be highly accurate at the gas densities considered in this study .",
    "this assumption allows us to model @xmath19 and @xmath36 as two - level systems and @xmath18 , @xmath29 and @xmath35 as three - level systems , allowing us to compute their effects in a straightforward fashion . for a two - level ion ,",

    ", we use rates from @xcite , which themselves were based on earlier work by @xcite . to model cooling from the @xmath51 ground state",
    ", we use our own fit to the data of @xcite .",
    "a number of other processes are of importance in ionized gas .",
    "we include cooling due to collisional ionization of atomic hydrogen and atomic helium , the gas phase recombination of @xmath48 and @xmath52 , ionic recombination on dust grains , compton scattering of cmb photons by free electrons ( compton cooling ) , and thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "the rates adopted for all of these processes are summarized in table  [ cool_other ] . as the chemical and thermal model presented here",
    "is not designed to be used for the study of very hot gas , we do not include processes involving @xmath265 ( although rates for these processes can be found in @xcite ) .    in neutral gas ,",
    "all of the aforementioned processes become ineffective . in cool , neutral gas ,",
    "most of the cooling comes from @xmath6 or from the fine structure lines of carbon , oxygen and silicon , which have already been discussed above .",
    "cooling from @xmath6 is treated in our model through use of the cooling function of @xcite , which we have extended to temperatures below @xmath266 by assuming that only the @xmath267 and @xmath268 transitions contribute significantly to the cooling rate . @xcite",
    "tabulate the @xmath6 cooling rate as a function of temperature , density , @xmath12:@xmath6 ratio and ortho : para ratio .",
    "for simplicity , in our implementation we do not track the evolution of the @xmath6 ortho : para ratio , instead keeping it fixed at 3:1 , but we note that variations in this ratio are unlikely to significantly affect the @xmath6 cooling rate at temperatures at which it contributes significantly to the total cooling rate ( see , for instance , figure  5 in @xcite ) .",
    "a comparison of the @xcite @xmath6 cooling rate with various other rates that have been used in the literature is given in paper ii ( figure  1 ) .",
    "at low temperatures ( @xmath269 ) , @xmath15 cooling becomes increasingly important and can dominate the total cooling rate if sufficient fractionation occurs @xcite . to model @xmath15 cooling , we use the recent cooling function of @xcite . they provide a complicated fit as a value of temperature and density that is valid over a wide range of both .",
    "for further details , the interested reader should consult their paper .",
    "we include two final processes that can become important in some circumstances .",
    "cooling due to @xmath6 collisional dissociation is modelled under the assumption that each dissociation removes @xmath2704.48  ev of thermal energy from the gas .",
    "it is an effective source of cooling only at temperatures above a few thousand kelvin . in practice ,",
    "the @xmath6 abundance in zero metallicity or low metallicity gas is frequently too small for this process to be important .",
    "we also include the effects of energy transfer from the gas to the dust grains ( if present ) , using a rate from @xcite . at solar metallicity ,",
    "this becomes important at a density @xmath271 , but at lower metallicities , it does not dominate until significantly larger densities are reached ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we include in our model the effects of several processes that can heat the gas .",
    "most of these processes operate only if a radiation background is present .",
    "the first of these is photoelectric emission from dust grains .",
    "this operates as follows : photons that interact with dust grains can cause the ejection of energetic electrons from the grain if the photon energy exceeds the work function of the grain . as the energy carried by the electrons",
    "is quickly thermalized , this leads to the heating of the gas .",
    "this process is of great importance in the local ism and has been examined in detail by a number of authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to accurately compute the effects of photoelectric emission , we need to know the grain size distribution and the composition of the grains",
    "however , as discussed previously , large uncertainties exist concerning the properties of grains in low metallicity protogalactic gas .",
    "we therefore make the same assumption here as we did in our treatment of grain surface chemistry , i.e.that the dust has the same properties as milky way dust , but has an abundance that is reduced by a factor @xmath272 .",
    "this assumption allows us to use the following expression for the photoelectric heating rate , taken from @xcite : @xmath273 where @xmath169 is a measure of the radiation energy density between @xmath170 and @xmath171 relative to the @xcite field , and where @xmath274 is the photoelectric heating efficiency , given by @xmath275 where @xmath276 .",
    "the parameter @xmath277 that controls the photoelectric heating efficiency is given by @xmath278 @xcite ; note that this differs by a factor of 2 from the parameter @xmath172 introduced in  [ surface_chem ] .",
    "for small @xmath277 , most grains are negatively charged and @xmath279 . on the other hand , for large @xmath277",
    ", most grains are positively charged , and @xmath274 is small , as it is difficult for photons with energies @xmath280 to dislodge further electrons from the grains .",
    "a second source of radiative heating is the photodissociation of @xmath6 .",
    "our treatment of photodissociation heating follows @xcite : we assume that each photodissociation deposits @xmath281 of themal energy into the gas . as well as photodissociating some of the @xmath6 , an ultraviolet background",
    "will also produce vibrationally excited @xmath6 via radiative pumping of the excited levels . in dense gas ,",
    "this pumping leads to heating as most of the excited molecules undergo collisional de - excitation .",
    "we include the effects of radiative pumping by adopting a pumping rate that is 8.5 times larger than the photodissociation rate @xcite , and assuming that each excitation transfers an average of @xmath282 to the gas @xcite , where @xmath283 is the critical density at which collisional de - excitation of vibrationally excited @xmath6 occurs at the same rate as radiative de - excitation .",
    "our value for @xmath283 is a weighted harmonic mean of the value for @xmath6-@xmath12 collisions given by @xcite , reduced by a factor of ten as advised by @xcite , and the value for @xmath6-@xmath6 collisions given by @xcite .",
    "heating due to the photoionization of @xmath12 or @xmath51 has already been discussed in  [ photochem ] and we do not discuss it further here . as is also discussed in that section , we do not include heating due to the photodetachment of @xmath49 , photodissociation of @xmath50 or photoionization of @xmath18 , @xmath29 , @xmath35 or @xmath36 , as the contribution from these processes is not significant .",
    "we also include the effects of heating due to @xmath6 formation .",
    "the formation of an @xmath6 molecule via reaction 2 releases 3.53  ev of energy , while formation via reaction 4 releases 1.83  ev , and formation on a grain surface ( reaction 60 ) releases 4.48  ev .",
    "we assume that essentially all of this energy goes into rotational and vibrational excitation of the resulting @xmath6 molecule , and hence is radiated away at low gas densities and is converted by collisional de - excitation into heat at high gas densities .",
    "finally , we include heating due to the ionization of the gas by cosmic rays .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that every ionization deposits 20  ev of heat in the gas , and so derive a heating rate that scales with the total cosmic ray ionization rate of the gas ( i.e.  the sum of the ionization rates for the various individual chemical species , weighted by the fractional abundances of those species ) . since considerable uncertainty exists concerning the value of the cosmic ray ionization rate in the local interstellar medium ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , let alone concerning the appropriate rate to use in high - redshift protogalaxies , a more detailed treatment does not appear to be warranted at this time .",
    "the chemical network and thermal model described in the preceding sections have a number of potential applications .",
    "one of the more obvious applications is the study of the cooling and gravitational collapse of gas in low metallicity protogalaxies .",
    "as previously noted , the density range for which our model is valid corresponds to a wide range of cosmological overdensities .",
    "it can therefore be used to study the thermal and chemical evolution of the majority of the gas within a given protogalaxy .",
    "for example , suppose we model the gas distribution within a @xmath43 halo as a singular isothermal sphere with mean number density within the virial radius @xmath284 ( a reasonable zeroth - order approximation for a protogalactic halo with a mean overdensity @xmath285 ; see e.g.  @xcite ) . in this case , only @xmath2704% of the gas within the halo has a density @xmath286 at which our model may break down .",
    "therefore , although our model is of limited usefulness for studying gravitational fragmentation and star formation within this dense central region , it does allow one to study many other important problems , such as how the minimum protogalactic mass at which cooling becomes effective is affected by the presence of metals , or how the gas responds to the presence of an ultraviolet background .",
    "we use a version of this model to address some of these questions in paper ii for the case of small protogalactic halos within initially ionized regions .",
    "a second possible application is the study of the evolution of the ism in high redshift , metal - poor dwarf galaxies . in this case , much of the gas involved is often gravitational stable , and so the characteristic timescales are longer than the gravitational free - fall time .",
    "this limits the applicability of the model to lower densities than in the case of gravitationally collapsing protogalaxies .",
    "however , even if we adopt a relatively long characteristic timescale @xmath287 , corresponding to the sound crossing time of a @xmath114 disk at a sound speed of @xmath288 , the model remains valid for densities up to @xmath289 even in the least auspicious case ( @xmath2 gas , with no significant uv radiation field present ) .",
    "our model is therefore well - suited for use in the study of the evolution of the warm neutral component of the ism in such galaxies and will in some cases also be useful in the study of the cold neutral component .",
    "however , the reader is reminded that our model does not treat hot ( @xmath11 ) , highly - ionized gas , and can not be used to study the effects of stellar feedback ( regions , supernovae , etc . ) unless coupled with some existing model capable of treating this hot gas ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    as well as studying the chemical evolution of gas _ within _ dwarf galaxies and protogalaxies , we can also use it to study the chemical evolution of gas _ between _ galaxies , i.e.  the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "one important reason to do so is the fact that several different obervational techniques have been suggested that may allow one to probe the thermal and chemical state of this gas .",
    "@xcite has suggested that if large regions of the igm remain neutral after the turn - on of the first observable ionizing sources , then atomic oxygen in the igm may be detectable through its uv absorption , as it will produce an forest analogous to the @xmath290 lyman-@xmath42 forest .",
    "@xcite also argue that a substantial fraction of the metals in high - redshift galactic winds are likely to be in low - ionization states and may be observable in absorption .",
    "metals in the high redshift igm may also leave detectable imprints in the fluctuation spectrum of the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite have recently suggested that fine structure emission from atomic oxygen may also produce a detectable spectral distortion of the cmb if the excited fine - structure levels can be populated by radiative pumping via the balmer-@xmath42 transition .",
    "accurate modelling of many of these effects requires accurate modelling of the temperature and chemical make - up of the intergalactic gas , and hence a model such as that presented here .",
