    "the absolute figure of the galilean geometry consist of an ordered triple @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the ideal ( absolute ) plane , @xmath4 is the line ( absolute line ) in @xmath3 and @xmath5 is the fixed elliptic involution of points of @xmath4 , @xcite . in the non - homogeneous coordinates the similarity group @xmath6 has the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are real numbers , @xcite .",
