    "taking into account the recent technological advances , and needs of our modern society , the study of the magnetic properties of new materials is of fundamental importance to develop devices for different applications such as , for example , memory structures.@xcite in view of their characteristics , amorphous silicon ( _ a_-si ) thin films seems to be good candidates for such a purpose.@xcite an interesting way of studying the _ a_-si thin films magnetic response is to focus on the properties of the neutral dangling - bonds ( d@xmath3 ) present in these materials .",
    "neutral dangling - bonds are paramagnetic centers that are excellent probes for the investigation of _ a_-si thin films .",
    "moreover , silicon dangling - bonds are charge trapping centers@xcite that are more stable under the diamagnetic d@xmath5 form.@xcite in the present work we have studied the behaviour of the paramagnetic defects d@xmath3 in amorphous silicon nitride thin films doped with various rare - earth elements , _ a_-sin : re ( re = rare - earths : y , la , pr , nd , sm , gd , tb , dy , ho , er , yb , and lu ) . depending on the re dopant , these thin films present a relative strong and narrow light emission , even at room temperature.@xcite,@xcite as a consequence , re - doped _",
    "a_-sin thin films",
    "are expected to be ideal candidates to develop photonic devices . towards this end",
    ", the study of their magnetic properties will certainly contribute to decide about the potential applications of these materials .",
    "all films were prepared in a high vacuum chamber ( base pressure @xmath6 torr ) , by radio frequency ( @xmath7 mhz ) sputtering a si ( @xmath8 % pure ) target covered at random with small pieces of metallic re ( @xmath9 % pure ) elements .",
    "polished crystalline ( _ c_-)si wafers and high - purity quartz plates were used as substrates in every deposition run . during deposition ,",
    "the substrates were kept at @xmath10 @xmath11c under a constant total pressure of @xmath12 torr consisting of a mixture of high - purity ar + n@xmath13 gases .",
    "the mean thickness of the films was @xmath14 nm .    the atomic composition of the _ a_-sin : re films ( @xmath15 si , @xmath16 n , @xmath17 re ) were determined by _ rutherford _",
    "backscattering spectrometry ( rbs ) in the case of si and re and by nuclear reaction analysis ( nra ) for n. a non - intentionally amount of hydrogen of @xmath18 h  was detected by elastic recoil detection ( erd ) analysis in all _ a-_sin : re films .",
    "the density of  the films was estimated to be @xmath19 at .",
    "the optical bandgap of these films were determined through optical transmission measurements in the visible - ultraviolet range using a commercial spectrophotometer and stays around @xmath21 ev.@xcite room-@xmath22 _ raman _ scattering measurements , using the @xmath23 nm line of an ar@xmath24 _ laser _ , were also performed and confirmed the amorphous structure of the films .",
    "the electron spin resonance ( esr ) experiments were carried out in  a _ bruker _ x - band ( @xmath25 ghz ) spectrometer using a room-@xmath26 te@xmath27 cavity .",
    "all mesuarements have been taken at room temperature .",
    "this work presents a new approach in the study of the d@xmath3 density of _ a_-sin thin films doped with res .",
    "our main finding was the depletion of the density of d@xmath3 in the _",
    "a_-sin matrix caused by the presence of magnetic re species .",
    "we have observed that the insertion of magnetic re species dramatically suppresses the number of esr active d@xmath3 states and that such a decrease approximately scales with the spin component of the re magnetic moment .",
    "table i displays the atomic concentrations [ re ] , [ si ] , [ n ] and [ h ] as determined from rbs , nra , and erd for all the films investigated in this work . from the d@xmath3",
    "esr intensity measurements , and using as standard a kcl - pitch sample , we have estimated the [ d@xmath0 of each film . the d@xmath3 esr parameters and [ d@xmath0 are also given in table i. as can be seen from table i , the average density of d@xmath3 magnetic defects in these films was of , typically , @xmath28  @xmath29 .",
    "figure @xmath30 shows the room-@xmath26 esr normalized spectra of d@xmath3 in _ a_-sin films doped with different re elements ( notice the different intensities ) . from a lorentzian lineshape fitting of the resonances for all the _ a_-sin : re thin films we have obtained approximately the same peak - to - peak linewidth , @xmath31 @xmath32 g , and field for resonance , @xmath33 g ( corresponding to @xmath34 ) .",
    "an early esr study on undoped _",
    "a-_si@xmath35n@xmath36  films pointed out a very weak d@xmath3 esr signal with @xmath37  and @xmath38  g.@xcite a comparison of these data with our larger linewidth and higher [ d@xmath1 suggests that the present _ a-_sin : re films are more disordered .",
    "this is probably associated to the higher n / si ratio ( @xmath39  in our films.@xcite    figure @xmath40 shows [ d@xmath0 for the various re elements investigated in this work .",
    "it is noted that the magnetic res cause a dramatic depletion of [ d@xmath41 and the strongest suppressing effect is found for gd@xmath42 , at the middle of the re - series . within our experimental accuracy , the non - magnetic re elements do not cause a systematic change in [ d@xmath0 . the inset of fig .",
    "@xmath40 presents the drop of [ d@xmath0 , or in another words , the number of inactive esr d@xmath3 , [ d@xmath3(re@xmath43)]@xmath44[d@xmath3(re@xmath45 ) ] , due to the presence of the magnetic re@xmath45 s relative to the average value for the non - magnetic re@xmath43 s .",
    "notice that the minimum in fig . @xmath40",
    "correlates quite well with the re s de gennes factor , @xmath46 , and/or the @xmath47 factor .",
    "the striking result of figure @xmath40 suggests that the mechanism responsible for the depletion of [ d@xmath0 involves the spin part of the re magnetic moment and may be attributed to a strong exchange - like coupling , @xmath48 , between the re@xmath42 spin , @xmath49 , and the spin of the d@xmath3 , @xmath50 .",
    "such a strong exchange coupling may probably shift and/or broaden the d@xmath3 resonance beyond the detection limit of our esr experimental facilities .",
    "it is then possible that a coupling of this kind leads to a [ d@xmath0 decrease involving the de gennes factor , @xmath46 .",
    "the existence of this factor has been largely confirmed in re - doped type ii superconductor compounds through the decrease of the superconducting temperature , @xmath4 , ( @xmath51 ) due to the cooper - pairs breaking property of the re ions .",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite at this point , we should also mention that the depletion of [ d@xmath0 could be approximately described by the spin part of the re - magnetic moment , @xmath47 , that also takes its highest value at the gd@xmath42 ion ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "these two analyses are showed in the inset of fig . @xmath40 .",
    "rare - earth doped amorphous silicon - nitrogen films were prepared by co - sputtering and investigated by means of different experimental techniques ( esr , @xmath53-susceptibility , ion - beam analyses , and _",
    "raman _ scattering ) .",
    "the main experimental results can be summarized as : @xmath54 a strong depletion in the density of d@xmath3 states induced by the presence of magnetic reions , and @xmath55 the correspondence between this depletion and the re s de gennes factor , @xmath46 , and/or the re s @xmath47 factor .",
    "these results led us to propose a mechanism involving a strong exchange - like coupling between the re@xmath42 magnetic moment and the spin of the silicon dangling - bond d@xmath3 . this strong coupling may cause a large shift and/or broadening of the d@xmath3 resonance which are beyond the limit of detection of our esr spectrometer .",
