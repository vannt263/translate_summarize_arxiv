    "there has been growing recent interest in the magnetic , ferroelectric , and piezoelectric properties of bismuth - based perovskite - structure oxides.@xcite in such materials , the formally bi@xmath4 ion occupies the perovskite @xmath5 site , and its stereochemically active @xmath6 lone pair induces a symmetry - lowering structural distortion that can lead to ferroelectricity.@xcite part of this interest lies in increasing concern about the environmental toxicity of lead - based piezoelectrics and the resulting search for alternative materials.@xcite in addition , the stereochemical activity of bi is being exploited to induce structural distortions in magnetic oxides , with the goal of forming ferromagnetic ferroelectrics ( so - called magnetoelectric multiferroics).@xcite although a large number of potential applications can be envisaged for a material which is simultaneously ferromagnetic and ferroelectric,@xcite there are currently no known single - phase materials which show large , robust magnetization and polarization at room temperature .    in this work",
    "we analyze the magnetic properties of three related bi - based multiferroics in order to understand the chemical and structural factors which affect the magnetic ordering temperature .",
    "our goal is to develop guidelines for designing new perovskite - structure ferroelectrics with a large macroscopic magnetization above room temperature .",
    "the focus of our investigation is the ( 111 ) layered double perovskite bi@xmath1fecro@xmath2 , and its parent compounds bifeo@xmath0  and bicro@xmath0 .",
    "bifeo@xmath0  is the most well - studied of the three compounds and has long been known to be ferroelectric , with a curie temperature @xmath7  k , and antiferromagnetic , with a nel temperature @xmath8  k.@xcite it crystallizes in a rhombohedrally distorted perovskite structure with space group @xmath9.@xcite recently , interest in this material has increased considerably , due to the report of a large electric polarization and a non - zero magnetization in epitaxial films of bifeo@xmath0 , both above room temperature.@xcite the large electric polarization , as well as the small magnetization found in 200 - 400  nm thick bifeo@xmath0  films , have been confirmed by other experiments and by first principles calculations @xcite ( see also section  [ pol ] ) , whereas the origin of the large magnetization observed for film thickness @xmath10 100  nm is still under debate .",
    "bicro@xmath0  was recently synthesized and reported to be a highly distorted perovskite with @xmath11 symmetry;@xcite a polar space group which permits the occurrence of ferroelectricity .",
    "antiferromagnetic ordering was reported with a residual magnetization of 0.02 @xmath12 per cr , suggestive of weak ferromagnetism .",
    "bi@xmath1fecro@xmath2   has not yet been realized experimentally , but has been predicted theoretically to be ferrimagnetic ( with a magnetic moment of 2 @xmath12 per formula unit ) and ferroelectric ( with a polarization of @xmath13 80  @xmath14c/@xmath15).@xcite the predicted ground state structure is very similar to the @xmath9 structure of bifeo@xmath0 , except that in every second ( 111 ) layer the fe@xmath4 cations are replaced by cr@xmath4 , which reduces the symmetry to the space group @xmath16 .",
    "such a @xmath17-site ordered structure could be realized by ( 111 ) layer - by - layer growth on an appropriate substrate.@xcite    the remainder of this article is structured as follows : first we present the computational details of our calculations .",
    "then , in section [ sec : res ] a - c , we compare the calculated ground state structures of the three systems , with a particular focus on the influence of the exchange - correlation potential used in the density functional formalism on the structural parameters ; this is particularly important for reproducing the correct physics in these strongly - correlated magnetic insulators .",
    "we also compare the calculated electric polarization of the three materials . in section [ section : m_t ]",
    "we calculate nearest and next - nearest neighbor magnetic couplings and determine the magnetic ordering temperatures for the three materials using the mean - field approximation .",
    "finally , in section  [ discussion ] we discuss the variation of the nearest neighbor couplings in these systems and the implications of our results for the design of new multiferroics with higher magnetic curie temperatures .",
    "all calculations described in this work were performed using the projector augmented wave ( paw ) formalism @xcite of density functional theory,@xcite implemented in the _ vienna ab - initio simulation package _ ( vasp).@xcite for bifeo@xmath0 the bi 5@xmath18 and the fe 3@xmath19 semicore states were treated as valence electrons , for bi@xmath1fecro@xmath0 and bicro@xmath0 we did not include semicore states in the valence . the local spin density approximation ( lda ) as well as the lda+@xmath3 method in the so - called fully localized limit@xcite",
    "was used to treat exchange and correlation .",
    "except where otherwise noted , the structural parameters were fixed to those obtained by full structural optimization using @xmath3=3  ev and @xmath20=0.8  ev ( for bi@xmath1fecro@xmath2  and bicro@xmath0 ) or @xmath20=1  ev ( for bifeo@xmath0 ) for the treatment of the transition metal @xmath18 orbitals .",
    "then , the electronic structure and magnetic coupling constants were calculated as a function of @xmath3 ( and fixed @xmath20 ) in the range @xmath3=3  ev - 6  ev . for simplicity",
    ", the same @xmath3 and @xmath20 were used on both the fe and cr sites in bi@xmath1fecro@xmath2 .",
    "all our results are well converged with respect to k - point mesh and the energy cutoff for the plane wave expansion . for details regarding the structural optimization of bifeo@xmath0",
    "see ref .  , and ref .   for bi@xmath1fecro@xmath2",
    "the electric polarization was calculated using the berry phase method.@xcite",
    "we begin by comparing the calculated structures of the three compounds .",
    "the ground state structure of bi@xmath1fecro@xmath2   was calculated in ref .   by optimizing the geometries of a range of starting configurations , obtained by freezing in high - symmetry unstable phonon modes of bicro@xmath0 @xcite and bialo@xmath0.@xcite the energies of structures constrained to the resulting symmetries",
    "are listed in table  [ table : fmhs40 ] for two magnetic configurations : ferromagnetic , and the ferrimagnetic equivalent of so - called g - type antiferromagnetic ordering , in which all spins within the same ( 111 ) plane are ferromagnetically aligned , with antiparallel alignment of spins in adjacent ( 111 ) planes .",
    "we see that the lowest energy structure of all the combinations tried has @xmath16 symmetry ( space - group 146 ) , with alternating rotations of the oxygen octahedra around the [ 111 ] direction , combined with relative displacements of all ions along [ 111 ] .",
    "this structure is closely related to the @xmath9 structure found experimentally for bifeo@xmath0,@xcite but with an additional symmetry lowering due to the different @xmath17 cations . from table  [",
    "table : fmhs40 ] one can also see that the ferrimagnetic configuration has a lower energy than the ferromagnetic case for all structural symmetries .",
    "the net magnetic moment of the ferrimagnetic case is 2 @xmath21 per fe - cr pair , which corresponds to a magnetization of 160.53 emu/@xmath22 in the case of the ground state @xmath16 structure .",
    "it is also clear from table  [ table : fmhs40 ] that typical energy differences between different magnetic configurations are significantly smaller than the energy differences due to different structural symmetries .",
    "moreover , the structural parameters ( not shown ) obtained for fm and fim ordering within a given structural symmetry differ only slightly .    llc space group & magnetic ordering & @xmath23 [ ev / f.u . ]",
    "+   + @xmath24 & fm & 1.722 + & fim & 1.670 + @xmath25 & fm & 1.215 + & fim & 1.096 + @xmath26 & fm & 0.837 + & fim & 0.683 + @xmath27 & fm & 0.612 + & fim & 0.473 + @xmath16 & fm & 0.176 + & fim & 0.000 +    to exclude the existence of a more complicated magnetic configuration with lower energy , we doubled the size of the unit cell along one of the rhombohedral lattice vectors and compared the total energies for all possible collinear spin configurations within the resulting supercell .",
    "the doubled unit cell allows for spin configurations with antiparallel alignment of magnetic cations of the same type , which would lead to a cancellation of the macroscopic magnetization . for these calculations",
    "no additional structural relaxations were performed ; the structure was fixed to that obtained by relaxation within the ferrimagnetic @xmath16 symmetry .",
    "based on the very similar structures we obtained above for fm and fim orderings , we do not expect that further structural relaxation would alter the relative energies of the different spin configurations .",
    "it was found that the `` g - type - like '' ferrimagnetic configuration described above is indeed the ground state , and no cancellation of the macroscopic magnetization occurs .",
    "we did not investigate the effect of spin - orbit coupling and the possibility of noncollinear spin structures or long - wavelength magnetic ordering .    for bifeo@xmath0  both the structure and the magnetic configuration",
    "are well established.@xcite therefore , we did not perform a similar thorough ground state search for this system and instead only relaxed the structure within the experimentally found @xmath9 symmetry in combination with g - type antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "the details of the structural relaxation of bifeo@xmath0  have already been presented in ref .",
    "and all calculated structural parameters agree well with experimental data .",
    "we note that the true magnetic structure of bifeo@xmath0  shows some slight deviations from the ideal g - type ordering , i.e. a long - wavelength spiral structure in the bulk @xcite and a slight canting of the magnetic moments in thin films,@xcite both caused by spin - orbit coupling . however , these effects are rather small and not relevant for the present study .    in the case of bicro@xmath0",
    "we also constrained the system to have rhombohedral @xmath9 symmetry and g - type antiferromagnetic ordering in our calculations , although recently this system was reported to have monoclinic symmetry.@xcite this was done in order to be able to systematically compare the properties of the series of compounds bifeo@xmath0 , bi@xmath1fecro@xmath2 , and bicro@xmath0 .",
    ".calculated lattice constant @xmath28 , rhombohedral angle @xmath29 , volume @xmath30 , and wyckoff parameters for bicro@xmath0 , bi@xmath1fecro@xmath2 , and bifeo@xmath0 .",
    "the internal structural parameters refer to the wyckoff positions 2@xmath28 ( @xmath31,@xmath31,@xmath31 ) for the cations and 6@xmath32 ( @xmath31,@xmath33,@xmath34 ) for the anions ( in case of the @xmath16 structure the corresponding wyckoff labels are 1@xmath28 and 3@xmath32 ) .",
    "[ table : compare ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in bicro@xmath0  the balance of the kinetic and potential exchange leads to a moderate antiferromagnetic coupling between the @xmath35 electrons on neighboring cr sites .",
    "this is stronger in the ideal cubic structure than in the distorted @xmath9 structure because the perfect 180@xmath36 cr - o - cr bond angles in the high - symmetry case result in stronger kinetic exchange .    if half of the cr@xmath4 ions in the cubic structure are replaced by @xmath37 fe@xmath4 , the antiferromagnetic part of the nearest neighbor coupling  now between fe@xmath4 ( @xmath37 ) and cr@xmath4 ( @xmath38 )  is drastically reduced and in fact the interaction becomes ferromagnetic .",
    "this can be explained by the additional _ ferromagnetic _ interactions between the @xmath39 electrons of the fe@xmath4 and the @xmath35 electrons of the cr@xmath4 ( see rule 3 above ) . when @xmath3 is increased , the remaining antiferromagnetic kinetic exchange between the @xmath35 electrons is suppressed and the net interaction in the cubic structure becomes ferromagnetic .",
    "interestingly , in the relaxed structure of @xmath16 bi@xmath1fecro@xmath2 , the nearest neighbor coupling between fe@xmath4 and cr@xmath4 is weakly antiferromagnetic .",
    "this difference between the cubic and relaxed structures can also be explained within the theory of superexchange : when the structure is relaxed , the fe - o - cr bond angle deviates from the perfect 180@xmath36 , allowing a certain degree of mixing between cr @xmath35 and fe @xmath39 states .",
    "this leads to a nonzero kinetic exchange between these orbitals and a stronger tendency for antiferromagnetic coupling .",
    "( note that similar behavior was discussed in ref .   for the la@xmath1fecro@xmath2 system .",
    ")    finally , for bifeo@xmath0  the strong @xmath39-@xmath39 coupling due to the @xmath40 bonding dominates and results in very strong antiferromagnetic nearest neighbor coupling and a high magnetic ordering temperature .    a similar trend in magnetic ordering temperatures than discussed here for the bifeo@xmath0/bi@xmath1fecro@xmath2/bicro@xmath0  system can also be observed for the closely related lafeo@xmath0/la@xmath1fecro@xmath2/lacro@xmath2 system ( see table [ table : tctn ] ) .",
    "the ordering temperatures of the end members lafeo@xmath0 and lacro@xmath0 are comparable to the corresponding bi systems but appear to be slightly larger , which could be due to smaller structural distortions in the non - ferroelectric la compounds . a curie temperature of 375  k and ferromagnetic order were reported for ( 111)-layered la@xmath1fecro@xmath2,@xcite but these results are still under debate.@xcite from our discussion",
    ", ferromagnetic order could be expected for this system , although the reported curie temperature seems to be too high to be explained by the weak ferromagnetic potential exchange caused by the superexchange interaction .    from the above discussion",
    "it can be seen that high magnetic ordering temperatures can be achieved in antiferro- or ferri - magnets by exploiting the strong antiferromagnetic superexchange between @xmath39 electrons .",
    "the highest ordering temperatures in perovskite structures with octahedral crystal field splittings can occur between two ions of @xmath41 electron configuration , although this would of course lead to an antiferromagnet with a net cancellation of magnetic moments .",
    "therefore , we propose that the best choice for a ferroelectric with a net spontaneous magnetization is to combine @xmath37 and @xmath41 ions . here , provided that the crystal field splitting is larger than the bandwidth , the material will be insulating , with a net magnetic moment of 3 @xmath21 per formula unit .",
    "while other combinations , such as @xmath41 - @xmath42 would also give strong superexchange coupling , the additional partially - filled sub - shells reduce the probability of insulating behavior . in addition",
    ", jahn - teller distortions and orbital ordering effects can lead to antiferromagnetic coupling in one direction and ferromagnetic coupling in another direction , which makes the simple rules outlined above more difficult to apply .",
    "finally we discuss some possible combinations of elements that will allow @xmath37 - @xmath41 coupling in the perovskite structure .",
    "first we consider retaining bi@xmath4 as the @xmath5-site cation in order to exploit its well - understood stereochemically active lone pair to induce the ferroelectric structural distortion . in this case an average oxidation state of 3 +",
    "is required on the cation b site , which limits the possible choices of magnetic ions considerably .",
    "co@xmath43/ni@xmath44 would be a possible candidate for strong @xmath37-@xmath41 coupling , but it is questionable if such a high oxidation state can be achieved for co.    another possibility is to change the oxidation state of the anions , for example by forming oxyfluorides .",
    "for example bi@xmath45mn(ii)ni(ii)o@xmath46f@xmath45 would have the appropriate @xmath37 and @xmath41 electron configurations , and could give the added benefit of an enhanced spontaneous electric polarization by strategic placement of the f@xmath47 anions .",
    "however , the magnetic coupling via f@xmath47 is weaker than via o@xmath48 and oxyfluorides are generally difficult to prepare and explosive",
    ".    a better choice would be to change to a different @xmath5-site cation , which is still lone - pair active , but which has a higher oxidation state .",
    "for example a 4 + @xmath5-site cation would retain charge neutrality with divalent d@xmath49 mn@xmath44 and d@xmath50 ni@xmath44 on the @xmath17 sites .",
    "in fact , several perovskite systems containing lone - pair active te@xmath43 on the @xmath5-site have been prepared in the past,@xcite with recent reserch focussing on se@xmath51te@xmath52cuo@xmath0 , as a model system to study superexchange interactions.@xcite however these systems are usually strongly distorted due to the small size and the stereochemically active lone pair of the te@xmath43 ion , leading to weak kinetic exchange and small magnetic ordering temperatures.@xcite po@xmath43 is also a possibility , but since it is radioactive it is less interesting for technological applications .    moving to the left in the periodic table , pb@xmath44 and tl@xmath53",
    "are also lone pair active cations , and pb@xmath44 of course is well known as an @xmath5-site active cation in ferroelectric perovskites . here",
    ", however , the average @xmath17-site oxidation state must be 4 + , excluding the possibility of a @xmath41 configuration .",
    "therefore it is unlikely that room - temperature pb - based perovskite multiferroics will be identified with this mechanism . even disregarding its toxicity ,",
    "the valence of tl@xmath53 is even more prohibitive .    in summary ,",
    "although the spontaneous electric polarization of many perovskite multiferroics persists to temperatures far above room temperature , our analysis suggests that achieving large room temperature magnetization will continue to be challenging .",
    "we suggest te@xmath1mnnio@xmath2 as one possible candidate within the perovskite structure , but it remains to be seen if the structural distortions in this system are too large to result in strong superexchange coupling .",
    "our analysis indicates that other routes to magnetism , such as the weak ferromagnetism believed to occur in bifeo@xmath0,@xcite are worthy of further pursuit , and that the search for multiferroics should be extended to structures other than perovskite , in which stronger magnetic interactions might be obtained .",
