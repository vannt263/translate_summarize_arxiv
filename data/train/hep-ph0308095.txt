    "the decays can be studied by means of the qcd factorization ( qcdf ) approach  @xcite .",
    "since the energies of final state mesons @xmath3 are order of @xmath4 , the soft corrections between the two mesons will therefore decouple in order of @xmath5 .",
    "only hard interactions between @xmath6 and @xmath2 survive in the heavy @xmath7 quark mass limit , @xmath8 , and soft effects are confined to @xmath6 system . in the qcdf approach , the transition matrix element of the 4-quark operator @xmath9 , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : qcdf ] , is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 are hard scattering functions , @xmath12 the @xmath13 transition form factor , @xmath14 the light - cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) of the final state mesons .",
    "the nonlocal quarks ( and gluon(s ) ) sandwiched between the vacuum and the final state meson can be expressed in terms of a set of lcdas . for the processes of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the vector and pseudoscalar mesons , respectively , we find that the weak annihilation diagrams induced by @xmath18 penguin operators , which are formally power - suppressed by order @xmath19 , are chirally and logarithmically enhanced owing to the non - vanishing end - point behavior of the twist-3 lcda of the pseudoscalar meson @xmath17  @xcite .",

    "the logarithmical divergence ( or enhancement ) is owing to the non - vanishing end - point behavior of the twist-3 lcda of the kaon .",

    "by comparing calculation results with the data , we therefore know that annihilation contributions are not negligible and could give 50% corrections to the decay amplitudes of @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , because the annihilation amplitudes give constructive contributions to @xmath30 modes , they need to have the large real part , @xmath38 for adopting @xmath39  mev .",
    "a totally different conclusion has been made in @xcite .",
    "their calculation gives almost imaginary annihilation contributions to the decay amplitudes .",

    "when compared with @xmath52 , to occur in the @xmath53 helicity amplitude , the spin of the @xmath54 in the emitted vector meson @xmath55 has to be flipped .",

    "the qcdf results indicate that the nonfactorizable correction to each helicity amplitude is not the same ; the effective wilson coefficients @xmath60 vary for different helicity amplitudes .",
    "the leading - twist nonfactorizable corrections to the transversely polarized amplitudes vanish in the chiral limit and hence it is necessary to take into account twist-3 das @xmath61 of the vector meson in order to have renormalization scale and scheme independent predictions . because the @xmath18 penguin contributions to the @xmath62-emission amplitudes are absent and annihilation",
    "is always suppressed by helicity mismatch , tree - dominated decays tend to have larger branching ratios than the penguin - dominated ones  @xcite .",

    "the integral of @xmath75 is divergent .",
    "however , it is known that the collinear expansion can not be correct in the end point region owing to the non - zero transverse momentum @xmath76 of the quark .",
    "thus we parametrize the integral as _ 0 ^ 1dzz^k_(z)6 z~_0 ^ 1dzz+2k_/m_b-1(m_b/_)(1+_h)-1 to account for the experimental value of @xmath66 , the parameter @xmath77 should be chosen as large as @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "it implies that @xmath79 may be largely enhanced by the nonfactorizable spectator interactions arising from the twist-3 kaon lcda @xmath75 , which are formally power - suppressed but chirally and logarithmically enhanced  @xcite .    nevertheless ,",
    "since the contribution of the twist-3 kaon lcda @xmath75 to the spectator diagram is end - point divergent in the collinear expansion , the vertex of the gluon and spectator quark should be considered to be inside the kaon wave function .",
    "i.e. , the kaon itself is at a three - parton fock state . instead of considering the contribution of the two - parton kaon lcda of twist-3 to spectator diagrams , we calculate the subleading corrections from the three - parton lcdas of the kaon and get @xmath80  @xcite which is well consistent with the data .",
    "the result also resolves the long - standing sign ambiguity of @xmath69 which turns out to be positive for its real part .",
    "the history of searching for the @xmath82 rate is very interesting .",
    "the @xmath83 mode was first reported by cleo in 1998  @xcite with a large branching ratio @xmath84 , but disappeared soon after analyzing a larger data set  @xcite which was confirmed by the later babar measurement  @xcite . however , recently belle observed a large @xmath83 rate , @xmath85 , and @xmath86  @xcite .",

    "the @xmath95 rate weakly depends on the annihilation effects . without annihilation , since the @xmath96 and @xmath97 terms are opposite in sign in the @xmath98 amplitude , the @xmath89 ratio should be very small .",
