    "interest in the optical properties of metallic nanostructures has been steadily increasing as experimental techniques for their fabrication and investigation have become more sophisticated @xcite .",
    "one of the main driving forces of this is their potential utility in sensing , photonic , and optoelectronics applications @xcite .",
    "however , there can also be interesting fundamental issues to consider , particularly as very small length scales are approached ( approximately less than 10 nm ) . in this limit , quantum mechanical effects can lead to unusual optical properties relative to predictions based on classical electrodynamics applied with bulk , local dielectric values for the metal @xcite . in isolated spherical nanoparticles , for example , localized surface plasmon resonances ( lsprs ) are found to be blueshifted relative to mie theory predictions @xcite , and in thin metal films , anomalous absorption is observed @xcite . roughly speaking , when light interacts with a structure of size @xmath0 ( e.g. , a nanoparticle size or junction gap distance ) , wavevector components @xmath1 , which are related to the momentum @xmath2 by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is planck s constant , are generated with magnitude @xmath5 .",
    "this , in turn , imparts an energy of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mass of an electron , to ( relatively ) free electrons in the metal . for small @xmath0",
    ", these energies can correspond to the optical range ( 1  6 ev ) .",
    "this analysis suggests that such effects should come into play for @xmath0 less than approximately 2 nm . in metals ,",
    "however , somewhat larger @xmath0 values also exhibit these effects , because electrons in motion at the fermi velocity can be excited by the same energy with a smaller momentum increase , due to dispersion effects .",
    "a full quantum mechanical treatment of such structures would of course be best , but this is not practical for these sizes .",
    "however , it is possible to incorporate some `` quantum effects '' within classical electrodynamics via use of a different dielectric model than that for the bulk metal .",
    "at least four such effects can be addressed in this way : electron scattering , electron spill - out , quantum size - effects , and spatial nonlocality of the material polarization .",
    "the additional losses due to increased electron scattering at the metal surface can be described by a size - dependent damping term @xcite , which will effectively broaden spectral peaks @xcite , as we consider below .",
    "the electron spill - out from the metal into the medium , due to the electron density varying smoothly , can partially be accounted for by a dielectric layer model .",
    "the effect of this is varied , and depends on a number of details , including the surface chemistry of the structure @xcite and its local dielectric environment .",
    "quantum size effects due to discrete electronic energy levels can lead to a size and shape - dependent conductivity .",
    "at least for metal films @xcite , this quantity is reduced relative to the bulk , and exhibits peaks for certain film thicknesses .",
    "such effects can be incorporated directly into classical calculations for some simple systems , based on rigorous theory .",
    "although , because this effect and electron spill - out are both highly dependent on system specifics , incorporating them into a general framework is not straightforward . therefore , they will not be considered in this work .",
    "the fourth quantum effect , and the one that is of main interest herein , is the need of a dielectric model which considers that the material polarization at one point in space depends not only on the local electric field , but also that in its neighborhood @xcite . in classical electrodynamics ,",
    "materials are described through a dielectric function @xmath8 that relates the electric displacement field @xmath9 ( proportional to both the incident field and material polarization ) to the electric field @xmath10 at a given frequency of light @xmath11 .",
    "this relationship is usually assumed to be local in space ( i.e. , the polarizability of the material at a point @xmath12 only depends on @xmath10 at @xmath12 ) .",
    "however , in the more general case @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a spatially - dependent ( nonlocal ) and frequency - dispersive relative dielectric function . in a homogeneous environment ( an approximation which we make for the finite , arbitrarily shaped structures considered herein ) , @xmath14 only spatially depends on @xmath15",
    ". therefore , in @xmath1-space , eq .",
    "( [ eq : e - to - d ] ) is more simply expressed as    @xmath16    since the first formulation of nonlocal electromagnetics @xcite , applications of @xmath1-dependent dielectric functions have remained limited to simple systems , such as spherical structures @xcite or aggregates thereof @xcite , and planar surfaces @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , this @xmath1-dependence has been found experimentally @xcite and proven theoretically @xcite to have important consequences .",
    "for example , such dependence is responsible for the aforementioned anomalous absorption and lspr blueshifting . in a recent letter @xcite",
    ", we outlined a powerful , yet simple method by which the optical properties of arbitrarily shaped structures with a nonlocal dielectric function can easily be calculated .",
    "this was done by deriving an equation of motion for the current associated with the hydrodynamic drude model @xcite , which we solved within the framework of the finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it can describe the dynamical optical response of structures that are too large to treat using quantum mechanics , yet small enough such that the application of local continuum electrodynamics becomes questionable . in this article",
    ", we expand on that work and detail the full method .",
    "we first verify our results against analytical ones for the cylindrical au nanowires that we considered in our previous letter @xcite .",
    "then , as new examples , we calculate the optical properties of one , two , and three dimensional au nanostructures .",
    "the interaction of light with matter in the classical continuum limit ( i.e. , many hundreds of atoms or more ) is described by maxwell s equations , @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the auxiliary magnetic field and _ the _ magnetic field , respectively , while @xmath23 and @xmath24 are external current and charge densities . except for the most simple systems , such as spheres or metal films , analytical solutions or simplifying approximations to eqs .  ( [ eq : maxwellamperert ] )  ( [ eq : gaussmagrt ] ) do not exist .",

    "@xmath44 is responsible for both the plasmonic optical response of metals and nonlocal effects .",

    "however , the present fitting scheme leads to parameters that are more physically realistic , and this is essential given that we are going to use these local ( @xmath80 ) parameters in the nonlocal ( @xmath81 ) expression .",
    "one consequence of this fit , for example , is that the minimum value of imag[@xmath67 ] near 1.85 ev is not as small as the experimental one , which will end up giving broader plasmon near this energy resonances than expected .",

    "such scattering can also be considered a nonlocal effect @xcite . in a formal sense , @xmath98 is related to the translational invariance at the surface , the full description of which depends on the geometry and morphology of the structure , its local dielectric environment @xcite , and the dielectric function of the material , which is ultimately nonlocal in character .",

    "furthermore , all simulations were carried out to at least 100 fs .    before leaving this subsection",
    ", we mention that instabilities have been encountered in some 3d calculations .",
    "for example , simulations of 1.0-nm au nanoparticles become unstable when grid spacings of 0.05 nm are used .",
    "however , in 2d , such instabilities do not seem to exist .",
    "we are currently investigating this issue .",
    "one way to determine the accuracy of the method presented in subsection [ sec : method : formulation ] and the appendix is to compare computed results to obtainable analytical ones .",
    "such comparisons are possible for metal films @xcite , cylindrical wires @xcite , and spherical particles @xcite . in this section",
    ", such a comparison is made for a @xmath100 nm radius cylindrical nanowire , an example that we considered in our previous letter @xcite .",
    "the optical responses calculated using uniform grid spacings @xmath101 in both @xmath102 and @xmath103 of @xmath104 , @xmath105 , or @xmath106 nm are compared to the analytical result @xcite in fig .",

    "a discussion of these effects was given in ref .  , and will be further elaborated on below .",
    "the calculated and analytical results are found to agree remarkably well , both qualitatively and quantitatively , providing numerical verification of our method .",
    "additionally , decreasing the grid spacing leads to significantly better results , especially for the higher energy peaks .",
    "for example , the additional peak near 3.78 ev converges from 3.53 to 3.68 to 3.72 ev as @xmath101 is reduced from @xmath104 to @xmath105 to @xmath106 nm , respectively .",
    "such convergence is understandable , because for a given grid spacing , there is an uncertainty in @xmath107 of @xmath108 .",
    "since the results appear to redshift with increasing @xmath101 , we can infer that the nanowire radius is approximately @xmath109 .",
    "the convergence of these effects is much tougher than those in local electrodynamics , where even @xmath110 nm is sufficient ( not shown ) .",
    "these results demonstrate the exquisite sensitivity of nonlocal effects to even minor geometric features .",
    "grid spacings of @xmath106 or @xmath105 nm are impractical for most calculations , because of the resulting computational effort required . at first",
    "this appears troublesome , given that the nonlocal effects are so sensitive to this parameter .",
    "however , the only real downside is that an uncertainty in the geometry of @xmath108 must be accepted ( which is also the case in local electrodynamics , but is less important ) .",
    "this is because it is found that for a given grid spacing , the calculated results always fall between the analytical ones that incorporate the @xmath108 tolerance ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : cyl_analyt_dx - tol ] .",
    "for example , in the case of a @xmath100 nm cylindrical nanowire , the calculated results with @xmath110 are constrained by the analytical ones with @xmath111 and @xmath112 nm . results for @xmath113 and @xmath106 nm are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cyl_analyt_dx - tol ] as well , and are also consistent with this analysis .",
    "in this subsection , we study the transmission , reflection , and absorption of thin au films illuminated at normal incidence ( see fig .  [ fig : d2_film ] for a schematic diagram of the incident polarization ) , which have an effective dimension of one . for simplicity , we take the surrounding medium to be air .",
    "although , it would be straightforward to introduce other dielectric layers into the calculations . because wavevector components only exist for the direction normal to the surface , these systems are ideal for studying and qualitatively highlighting nonlocal effects .",
    "furthermore , they allow us to draw some connections with related experimental results @xcite .",
    "the transmission , reflection , and absorption spectra for 2 , 10 , and 20 nm thick films are shown in figs .  [ fig : film_2 nm ]  [ fig : film_20 nm ] , respectively .                in the absorption spectra , narrow additional ( anomalous ) absorption peaks occur in the nonlocal results , relative to the local ones .",
    "the appearance of these peaks is identical to theoretical predictions @xcite and experimental observations @xcite on other thin metal films , where they are the result of optically excited longitudinal ( or volume ) plasmons .",
    "( the effects are called such because they are longitudinal to @xmath1 and are contained within the volume of the structure , unlike surface plasmons , which propagate along a metal  dielectric interface . )",
    "not surprisingly , at the anomalous absorption energies , there is corresponding decrease in the transmission .",
    "however , contrary to the initial expectation of a decrease in reflection , we find that there can be either an increase or a decrease , depending on if the corresponding absorption occurs well above ( giving an increase ) or below ( giving a decrease ) the surface plasmon energy , which is around 2.65 ev for the 10-nm film , for example .",
    "although a little hard to discern from figs .  [",
    "fig : film_2 nm ]  [ fig : film_20 nm ] , but can be inferred from previous results @xcite , the anomalous absorption peaks redshift as the film thickness is increased .",
    "this causes many more such peaks that were at higher energies to appear in the optical range .",
    "for example , there are three peaks for the 2-nm film ( fig .",
    "[ fig : film_2 nm ] ) , but twelve for the 10-nm one ( fig .",
    "[ fig : film_10 nm ] ) .",
    "in addition , their intensities drastically decrease , where by 20-nm , the nonlocal results are almost converged to the local ones ; fig .",

    "[ fig : d2_film ] and the analysis above , it makes sense that the anomalous absorption features should redshift with increasing thickness and that their intensity should decrease with increasing @xmath117 .    from the discussion above , and that in subsection [ section : diel_model ] , the approximate anomalous absorption energies can be predicted . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hydrodynamic - drude ] ) , it is seen that rapid variations in @xmath91 will occur when @xmath120 , which will likely lead to an absorption condition ; and from eq .",

    "[ fig : au_nanoparticles ] .",
    "( the polarization and direction of incident light is irrelevant . )",
    "note that for small nanoparticles , such as these , the optical responses are predominately absorption , as scattering does not play a significant role for sizes less than approximately 20 nm .",
    "figure [ fig : au_nanoparticles ] shows that inclusion of nonlocal effects results in significant anomalous absorption and lspr blueshifting for both the 4 and 7-nm nanoparticles .",
    "in fact , these effects are so large that the main lsprs are hardly even distinguishable .    as discussed in subsection [",
    "sec : rslts : apps : films ] , the anomalous absorption peaks arise from the excitation of longitudinal plasmons .",
    "however , unlike the systems discussed in that subsection , this effect diminishes much faster as the nanoparticle size is increased , such that at 15-nm , the anomalous peaks show up only as slight indents on the main lspr .",
    "these differences can be attributed to two effects .",
    "first of all , in a spherical nanoparticle , scattering of the incident light off of the exterior surface generates many @xmath1-components that can interact and dephase one another , especially for the high - order @xmath117 modes with multiple nodes .",
    "secondly , scattering of the conduction electrons that compose the longitudinal plasmons off of the interior surface can also lead to dephasing .",
    "each of these processes causes nonlocal effects to diminish at much smaller distances in spherical nanoparticles , relative to metal films .",
    "lspr blueshifting is most apparent for the 15-nm nanoparticle .",
    "this is simply because the anomalous absorption is low , allowing this peak to be clearly identified .",
    "the local lspr is seen at 2.57 ev , while the nonlocal one is seen at 2.71 ev .",
    "this effect can be understood by looking at the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hydrodynamic - drude ] ) .",
    "when nonlocal effects are included , the interplay between @xmath11 and @xmath1 causes all effects \\{e.g . , the absorption condition of real@xmath83 = -2 $ ] , in this case } to appear at higher energies compared to @xmath80 .",

    "the most probable one is that experimental measurements are often made on heterogeneous collections of nanoparticles . given that nonlocal effects are very sensitive to nanoparticle dimensions ( see section [ sec : rslts : subsec : verification ] , for example ) , slight heterogeneity could effectively average them away .",
    "support for this claim comes from an experimental study of isolated au nanoparticles @xcite , which clearly demonstrated the lspr blueshift , and possibly anomalous absorption features @xcite .",
    "another possible explanation is that our choice of @xmath87 is not optimal ( which is directly related to the strength of nonlocal effects ) , as we have recently argued for metallic nanoshells @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic drude model neglects quantum mechanical exchange and correlation effects , which in a local density approximation would decrease @xmath87 .",
    "a third possible explanation is that our choice of damping parameter @xmath98 is too low .",
    "increasing this would smooth all spectral features ( i.e. , the anomalous absorption would not appear as strong ) .",
    "support for this comes from a combined theoretical ( local electrodynamics ) and experimental study of metallic nanoshells , where values of greater than 1.0 are needed to describe the results ( this corresponds to @xmath127 reduced below that based on geometric considerations alone ) @xcite .      in our previous letter",
    "@xcite , we demonstrated that nonlocal effects are particularly important in structures with apex features , such as triangular nanowires .",
    "in such structures , optical responses can be affected by nonlocal effects for much larger sizes than for those with smooth geometries , such as cylindrical nanowires .",
    "additionally , even though far - field optical properties seem to converge to local ones at large sizes with regard to anomalous absorption and lspr blueshifting ( to a large extent ) , the near - field properties , such as electric field enhancements , hereon referred to as @xmath128 enhancements , do not .",
    "as a final application of the method presented in subsection [ sec : method : formulation ] and the appendix , we study the optical responses and @xmath128 enhancements around isolated cylindrical , square , and triangular nanowires with 50 nm diameters or side - lengths , common sizes used in experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "@xmath128 enhancements from such structures have been studied in the past @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , all previous studies have been carried out using local electrodynamics ( at least for non - cylindrical structures ) , except for the aforementioned discussion in our previous letter @xcite .",
    "optical responses of nanowires illuminated with the @xmath10-field polarized along the long axis of each structure are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nanowires_opt - resp ] .",
    "( schematic diagrams of the polarization are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : nanowires_d2 ] and [ fig : nanowires_e2 ] . )    -field polarized along the longest axis of the structure . both local ( broken red lines ) and nonlocal ( solid blue lines ) calculations are shown . ]    because of their large sizes , these structures do not exhibit distinct anomalous absorption .",
    "nonetheless , many closely spaced longitudinal plasmon modes do exist ( _ vide infra _ ) , which leads to very minor , closely spaced `` bumps '' in the nonlocal results , as well as lspr blueshifting .",
    "these modes can again be confirmed by looking at intensity profiles of @xmath129 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : nanowires_d2 ] .",
    "intensity profiles at the lspr energies in and around ( left ) cylindrical , ( middle ) square , and ( right ) triangular au nanowires with diameters or side - lengths of 50 nm .",
    "both ( top ) local and ( bottom ) nonlocal calculations are shown . the polarization and direction of incident light is indicated ; the nanowires are outlined in white . ]    unlike the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : d2_film ] , the longitudinal plasmons in fig .",
    "[ fig : nanowires_d2 ] form much more complex patterns .",
    "these can be attributed to two ( related ) effects .",
    "one is that the size of the structure along the longitudinal direction of the incident field is not the same at all positions .",
    "therefore , for a given energy , modes of different order will be sustained at multiple positions along the structure , at each place where eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda_l ] ) is satisfied @xcite .",
    "this is also one of the reasons why nonlocal effects are so strong in structures with apex features , and why they can remain important in them for arbitrarily large sizes . in other words , low - order longitudinal plasmon modes can always be sustained near the apex .",
    "and two , scattering of the incident field off of a curved nanowire surface generates many @xmath1-components , which can excite longitudinal plasmons along directions other than that of the incident @xmath1 , creating an interference pattern .",
    "this effect also leads to the dephasing of longitudinal plasmons , as discussed in subsection [ section : rslts_nanoparticles ] .",
    "it is also interesting to look at intensity profiles of @xmath128 at the lspr energies , near where this quantity is expected to be maximized @xcite ; fig .",
    "[ fig : nanowires_e2 ] .",
    "intensity profiles at the lspr energies in and around ( left ) cylindrical , ( middle ) square , and ( right ) triangular au nanowires with diameters or side - lengths of 50 nm .",
    "both ( top ) local and ( bottom ) nonlocal calculations are shown . the polarization and direction of incident light is indicated ; the nanowires are outlined in white . ]",
    "( note that these energies are slightly different in the local and nonlocal results , due to lspr blueshifting . ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : nanowires_e2 ] , the @xmath128 profiles have been normalized for each geometry so that relative comparisons between the local and nonlocal results can be made . because of this , it is not possible to directly compare the results for different geometries , but such comparisons will be considered below . in all cases ,",
    "the @xmath128 values are qualitatively similar , both inside and around the structures .",
    "quantitatively , however , the nonlocal enhancements are clearly lower .",
    "this is especially true for the triangular nanowires .    in order to accurately assess the @xmath128 enhancements around the nanowires , the precise maximum and average values were determined ; table [ tb : nanowire_enhancements ] .",
    ".maximum and average @xmath128 enhancements at the lspr energies around cylindrical , square , and triangular nanowires with diameters or side - lengths of 50 nm .",
    "each was illuminated with the @xmath10-field polarized along the longest axis of the structure .",
    "distances from the nanowire surfaces over which averages were obtained are specified .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the average values refer to fields averaged over certain distances from the nanowire surfaces . in all cases , decreases in both quantities are seen in the nonlocal results ( as could also be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : nanowires_e2 ] , and the discussion above ) . however , for the cylindrical nanowires , these decreases are negligible .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the average enhancements are higher 1.0 nm away from the surface than they are at 0.5 nm . for the square nanowires ,",
    "the decreases are noticeably larger .",
    "there is approximately a 10% difference in both quantities at 1.0 nm , and a 6% difference in the average values at 2.0 nm .",
    "the decrease in the difference between average enhancements at a further distance from the surface is expected , as the near - fields that contribute to this exponentially decay .",
    "the decreases in @xmath128 enhancements for the triangular nanowires are strikingly larger than for the other geometries .",
    "for example , decreases of 104% and 61% in the maximum and average values , respectively , are seen at 0.5 nm .",
    "considering that some physical processes are dependent on @xmath130 enhancements @xcite , such as surface - enhanced raman scattering ( sers ) , the differences between local and nonlocal electrodynamics could have significant implications for the interpretations of results .",
    "this statement is based on the fact that the nonlocal calculations are , in principle , more rigorous than the local ones .",
    "for example , if the actual electromagnetic contribution to sers is smaller than expected on the basis of local theory , it is possible that chemical effects play a more important role than has been considered in the past @xcite .",
    "such results are also likely to play a large role in the accurate interpretation of electron energy loss measurements for anisotropic nanoparticle structures , which have recently received attention within the framework of local electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "in summary , we detailed our electrodynamics method to calculate the optical response of an arbitrarily shaped structure described by a spatially nonlocal dielectric function .",
    "the formulation was based on converting the hydrodynamic drude model into an equation of motion for the conduction electons , which then served as a current field in the maxwell  ampre law . by discretizing this equation using standard finite - difference techniques",
    ", we incorporated it into a self - consistent computational scheme along with the standard equations used in the finite - difference time - domain method .    using the example of a cylindrical au nanowire studied in our previous letter @xcite",
    ", we demonstrated the remarkable accuracy of our method through comparisons to analytical results .",
    "as new applications , we calculated the optical responses of thin metal au films , au nanowires , and spherical au nanoparticles .",
    "these calculations demonstrated a number of effects that result from the spatial nonlocality in the dielectric response , including anomalous absorption , blueshifting of localized surface plasmon resonances , and decreases in electromagnetic field enhancements .",
    "the results presented demonstrate the importance of including nonlocal effects when describing metal  light interactions at the nanometer length scale .",
    "it is presently difficult to compare our results directly with existing experimental studies , because most of these have involved heterogeneous collections of particles or non - continuous systems , which in the small size limit tend to average over nonlocal effects .",
    "it is our hope that these results will motivate new , and more precise experimental studies , particularly those on isolated nanostructures , where nonlocal effects are likely to play a large role .    in the future",
    ", we plan to derive more accurate expressions than the hydrodynamic drude model . by incorporating exchange and correlation effects",
    ", we also plan to compare nonlocal calculations directly with quantum mechanical approaches , such as electronic structure theory .",
    "such expressions will allow more even more accurate descriptions of nonlocal optical phenomena than were presented in this work .",
