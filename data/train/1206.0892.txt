    "in 1933 , borsuk @xcite made the following conjecture .",
    "every set of diameter @xmath7 in the euclidean @xmath2-space @xmath8 is the union of @xmath9 sets of diameters less than @xmath4 .    from the 1930s ,",
    "this conjecture has attracted a wide interest among geometers .",
    "the frequent attempts to prove it led to results in a number of special cases : for sets in @xmath10 and @xmath11 , for smooth bodies or sets with certain symmetries , etc . , but the conjecture in general remained open till 1993 , when it was disproved by kahn and kalai @xcite .",
    "their result did not mean that research on this problem stopped : the investigation of the so - called _ borsuk number _ of a bounded set ; that is , the minimum number of pieces of smaller diameters that it can be partitioned into , is still one of the fundamental problems of discrete geometry .    since 1933 , a large number of generalizations of borsuk s problem has been introduced . without completeness , we list only a few .",
    "the _ generalized borsuk problem _ asks to find , for a fixed value of @xmath12 , the minimum number @xmath3 such that any set of diameter one in @xmath8 can be partitioned into @xmath3 pieces of diameters at most @xmath13 ( cf .",
    ", for example , @xcite ) .",
