    "the rigorous , statistical confirmation of bimodality within the luminous ( @xmath0 mag ) , nearby galaxy population has proven a key result to emerge from modern wide - field imaging surveys  implying the existence of two principal evolutionary pathways for bright systems .",

    "specifically , e / s0s dominate the red , high-@xmath14 ( centrally - concentrated ) peak , sd / irrs dominate the blue , low-@xmath14 ( diffuse ) peak , and sa - sc galaxy types span both .",
    "the authors proposed that this relationship derives from the two - component nature of galaxies , and that objects falling between the two peaks of the global bimodality result from the mixing of separate red , compact , bulge and blue , diffuse , disc components in varying degrees .",
    "@xcite challenged this hypothesis based upon a sample of 39 s0-sc galaxies with high - resolution , hst imaging .",
    "specifically , they recovered a correlation between galaxy color and ( visually - classified ) bulge type , such that classical bulge systems are globally red ( i.e. , also have red discs ) and pseudobulge systems are globally blue , regardless of the bulge - to - total flux ratio .    here",
    "we further explore the origin of the color - concentration bimodality using the results of allen et al.s ( 2006 ) bulge - disc decomposition of 10,095 bright galaxies in the mgc .",

    "we contrast the global color - concentration distributions of one - component and two - component galaxies ; identify key structural types and construct their luminosity functions ; and examine the relationship between bulge and disc colors .",

    "has ensured over 96% redshift completeness for a sub - sample ( mgc - bright ) of 10,095 galaxies with @xmath25 mag .",
    "@xcite modeled the 2d light distributions of the entire mgc - bright sample , providing a publicly available structural cataloguejliske / mgc/ ] .",

    "the exponential disc model may be considered a specific case of the srsic profile for @xmath28 with the following major axis intensity profile : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the central intensity and @xmath31 is the disc scale - length . for a comprehensive review of the srsic profile see @xcite . ] using the gim2d analysis package @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite designed a logical filter to identify and replace illogical fits ( e.g.  inverted profiles where the inner bulge was fit by the exponential component and the outer disc by the srsic component ) .",
    "based on the best - fit model parameters , the logical filter also offers an objective and quantitative subdivision of the local galaxy population into three morphological classes .",
    "namely , ` bulge - plus - disc ' , for which the two - component model is preferred ; and ` elliptical ' and ` disc - only ' , for which the one - component model is preferred . the distinction between the latter two classes is simply made according to the value of the best - fit global srsic index ( i.e. , greater than or less than 1.5 respectively ) , recalling the absence of dwarf galaxies in mgc - bright .",
    "a known problem exists for automated photometric decomposition studies concerning the treatment of elliptical galaxies .",
    "namely , that two - component fits to eyeball - morphological ellipticals will readily converge upon a solution containing an outer disc , although no such structural component is actually present ( see @xcite ) .",
    "rather , these ` false discs ' serve only to correct slight deviations in the measured light profile from a pure global srsic model",
    ". the origin of these deviations may be real ( e.g.  a recent merger event , twisting of the inner isophotes , or the presence of an outer halo ) or artificial ( e.g.  incorrect estimation of the sky background ) .",
    "@xcite attempt to remove ` false disc ' systems from their two - component population via the logical filter , which assigns all galaxies with model fits corresponding to bulge - to - total flux ratios ( b / t ) greater than 0.8 to the one - component population .",
    "the authors claim to demonstrate the success of this approach by contrasting the inclination distribution of their real disc sample , which is roughly consistent with a random distribution of projections on the sky , against that of their false disc sample , which is biased towards a more face - on distribution .    however , the b / t @xmath32 0.8 cut employed by @xcite is significantly less restrictive than the b / t @xmath32 0.6 cut more commonly employed in contemporary studies ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "hence , we conducted visual inspection of the real ( mgc ) and model ( gim2d ) , @xmath23-band images and surface brightness profiles of 100 bright ( @xmath33 mag ) galaxies from allen et al.s ( 2006 ) bulge - plus - disc sample in order to gauge the reliability of this dataset .",
    "a total of 23 probable ` false discs ' were thereby identified amongst 72 real discs and 5 systems of indeterminate type .",
    "three examples of these ` false disc ' candidates are displayed in fig .",
    "[ cut ] in the appendix .",
    "these galaxies display elliptical visual morphologies , although slight flux asymmetries are revealed upon inspection of the image residuals from their one - component fits .",
    "such asymmetries may derive from a diverse range of factors , including recent mergers and the presence of undigested satellites .",
    "reviewing the inclination distribution of allen et al.s ( 2006 ) bulge - plus - disc sample ( their fig .",
    "9 ) , we note that the logical filter has reduced , _ but not entirely removed _ , the bias towards face - on ` disc ' fits .",
    "interestingly , this bias can be further reduced by applying the more conventional b / t @xmath34 cut ( as shown in our fig .",
    "[ bt ] ) . of the 100 visually - classified systems discussed above , 15 of the 23 ` false disc ' candidates and only 2 of the 72 real discs",
    "are removed by this cut ",
    "revealing this to be a robust , yet conservative , step towards reducing ` false disc ' contamination .",
    "all galaxies from allen et al.s ( 2006 ) bulge - plus - disc sample with b / t @xmath32 0.6 ( 581 of 4427 objects ) were therefore reassigned to the one component population for the remainder of this investigation .      motivated by driver",
    "et al.s ( 2005 ) study of the mgc luminosity - size plane , we select only those galaxies with ( i ) @xmath35 to ensure minimal impact from peculiar velocities , galaxy evolution , and the k - correction , and ( ii ) @xmath36 mag arcsec@xmath21 to exclude the lowest signal - to - noise systems for which the photometry is less reliable .",
    "we also restrict our analysis to near face - on discs ( @xmath37 deg ) to minimise potential biases due to internal , inclination dependent dust extinction @xcite .",
    "a limit of @xmath0 mag is then used to isolate the well - sampled bright - end of the luminosity function .    by duplicating their bulge - disc decomposition analysis on a sub - sample of 682 galaxies with repeat observations , @xcite",
    "establish limits on the robustness of their derived _",
    "global _ structural parameters against variations in the local observing conditions .",
    "namely , for the accurate recovery of _ global _ properties @xmath38 is required ( where @xmath26 is the global half light radius and @xmath39 the characteristic seeing fwhm ) ; and for the accurate recovery of _ bulge _ properties @xmath40 is also required ( where @xmath41 is the bulge half light radius ) .",
    "hence , we apply the former limit to our entire sample used to construct global color - concentration distributions , and we employ the latter limit to identify bulge - plus - disc systems with ` confident ' bulge srsic indices ( and hence b / t flux ratios ) during the computation of component colors ( see section [ compcolors ] ) .",
    "in our final sample there are 917 elliptical , 1544 disc - only , and 1526 bulge - plus - disc systems ( 812 with ` confident ' bulge srsic indices ) .",
    "visibility - volume weights @xcite were computed to account for the relevant observational biases against each structural type .",
    "these weights are used throughout this paper to recover volume - density distributions from the raw data .",
    "all galaxies in mgc - bright have well - matched counterparts in the sdss - dr5 @xcite , which provides psf , petrosian , and model magnitudes in the sloan @xmath42@xmath43@xmath44@xmath45@xmath46 filter system @xcite .",
    "we compute ( apparent ) _ global _ @xmath47 colors for our entire sample using the sdss model magnitudes because these offer the highest signal - to - noise measurements , particularly for the problematic @xmath42-band ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we also derive ( apparent ) _ component _ @xmath48 ) colors for our bulge - plus - disc systems as follows .",
    "core colors are computed from the sdss psf magnitudes via the relation @xmath49 .",
    "the third term in this equation , @xmath50 , is required in order to account for an intrinsic difference in area ( and hence , enclosed core flux ) between the sdss @xmath42 and @xmath44-band psfs .",
    "we then equate this core color with the color of the bulge , which is a reasonable assumption provided the bulge is a similar size to the sdss @xmath42 and @xmath44-band psfs ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 arcsec respectively ) . for bulges much smaller than the sdss psfs",
    "the core color may be biased by the inclusion of significant disc flux . for bulges much larger than the sdss psfs use of the core color may give undue weight to small - scale , radial variations in the bulge color resulting from compact central nuclei , star - forming rings , nuclear bars , and/or nuclear dust lanes @xcite . the radius inside which the model bulge intensity exceeds that of the model disc ( i.e. , the ` anchor point ' , @xmath53 ) provides a useful measure of bulge size in this context . of our 812 component bulges with",
    "` confident ' srsic indices , 145 are a similar size to the sdss @xmath42 and @xmath44-band psfs ( i.e , @xmath54 ) , while 217 are smaller and 450 are larger .",
    "hence , a distinction is made in our later analysis between galaxies with ` confident ' and ` less confident ' bulge ( and disc ) colors based on this size criterion .",
    "we then suppose that the ( unknown ) @xmath43-band b / t flux ratios of our two - component systems may be approximated by their ( known ) @xmath23-band values , given the overlapping wavelength ranges covered by these two filters .",
    "this enables the computation of @xmath43-band bulge magnitudes from the sdss @xmath43-band model magnitudes , and thus @xmath42 and @xmath44-band bulge magnitudes using our bulge colors .",
    "the corresponding disc magnitudes in these sloan filters are then obtained by subtracting the bulge flux from total ( model ) flux , and disc colors derived from their difference .",
    "the relevant formula is @xmath55    k- and e- corrections are required for the computation of _ absolute _ magnitudes and rest - frame colors .",
    "individual k - corrections for galaxies in mgc - bright were computed by @xcite by matching broadband seds provided by the ( global ) mgc and sdss magnitudes to the 27 spectral templates given in @xcite . here",
    "we repeat this process in order to generate accurate and consistent k - corrections for the bulges and discs of our two - component systems using the separate colors derived above . for",
    "the e - correction @xcite adopt a pure luminosity evolution model of the form @xmath56 where @xmath57 in the @xmath23-band , regardless of galaxy type .",
    "for consistency with earlier work we continue to utilize the mgc @xmath23-band absolute magnitudes derived in this manner , but extend this approach to better estimate rest - frame ( @xmath58 ) colors .",
    "specificially , we adjust the @xmath59 values for each galaxy and component according to its best - fit spectral type . @xcite",
    "employ three stellar population models , roughly corresponding to e , sa and sc spectral types , as the basis of their 27 templates .",
    "the low redshift evolution in these models may be appoximated by @xmath59 values of 1.1 , 1.4 , and 2.2 in the @xmath42-band and 0.82 , 0.92 , and 1.1 in the @xmath44-band respectively .",
    "accounting for the impact of both internal and external dust extinction is an essential step towards the recovery of colors and luminosities representative of galaxy stellar populations .",
    "all mgc magnitudes @xcite are corrected for _ external _ dust extinction ( i.e. , that arising due to dust within the milky way ) using the maps of @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite recovered empirical inclination - attentuation relations from the mgc structural catalogue , and used these to calibrate opacities in tuffs et al.s ( 2004 ) multi - component dust models .",
    "the mean dust corrections thereby derived ( see table 1 of @xcite ) are employed in this study to account for the effects of _ internal _ dust extinction on various disc galaxy observables . for our inclination - limited sample ( @xmath37 deg )",
    "we obtain median corrections of @xmath60 mag and @xmath61 mag for component discs , and @xmath62 mag and @xmath63 for component bulges .",
    "these corrections are applied to all our disc - only and bulge - plus - disc systems , and their impact is indicated via reddening vectors marked on the relevant plots in section [ results ] .",
    "however , observations indicating a possible variation in dust content with morphological type raise questions regarding the validity of these corrections for the entire bulge - plus - disc galaxy population .",
    "in particular , a strong decrease is observed in the visually - estimated dust content of galaxies from late to early hubble types @xcite , although far - ir emission estimates of dust content suggest a weaker trend @xcite . as tuffs et al.s ( 2004 )",
    "dust model was devised with reference to nearby spiral galaxies only , and driver et al.s ( 2007b ) inclination attenuation relation is dominated by late - type discs , it may not be appropriate to apply the resulting corrections to early - type discs . although , some recent observations suggest a surprising level of similarity between the _ distributions _ of dust in these morphological types , including the presence of ` dust spiral arms ' in s0s @xcite . in section [ results ]",
    "we discuss this potential source of bias in our results , and compute alternative luminosity functions for early - type bulge - plus - disc systems .",
    "+      allen et al.s ( 2006 ) catalogue includes 68% confidence limits on the measurement of each structural parameter , estimated by gim2d based on the shape of the @xmath64 minimum in which each fit converges .",
    "the median error on the global srsic indices of galaxies in our sample is @xmath65 .",
    "measurement uncertainties on our absolute @xmath66 colors may be estimated as follows .",
    "firstly , we note that for all galaxies in our sample the relevant sdss magnitudes have quoted errors of less than @xmath67 mag .",
    "secondly , we observe that the vast majority of our global and component , broadband seds are well - matched by one of the 27 spectral templates from @xcite , and thus adopt a maximum uncertainty of @xmath681 hubble morphological type .",
    "this translates to k - correction and e - correction error contributions to the absolute @xmath66 colors of no more than @xmath680.03 mag and @xmath680.14 mag respectively .",
    "a further error of @xmath69 mag is contributed by uncertaintes in the internal dust corrections derived by @xcite and the measurement of disc inclinations .",
    "hence , the total uncertainty on our absolute @xmath66 colors is roughly @xmath70 mag . of course ,",
    "the uncertainties in our ` less confident ' _ component _ bulge and disc colors will be significantly larger , so we remove these systems from our analysis of component colors in section [ bdcolors ] .",
    "the presence of unmodeled structural features in a number of our two - component systems contributes an additional source of uncertainty in the measurement of bulge and disc colors which is not accounted for by our limits on size used to identify galaxies with ` confident ' bulge srsic indices and colors .",
    "specifically , a number of authors ( e.g.  @xcite ) have recently demonstrated that neglecting to account for bars during bulge - disc decompositions can lead to large systematic biases : bulge srsic indices , scale - sizes , and fluxes are over - estimated as the model bulge component is forced wider to account for bar flux , and the corresponding disc profile becomes steeper to compensate @xcite . from a sample of 186 bright nearby galaxies , @xcite estimate ( via visual classification ) that over half of all bright spirals are strongly - barred in the near - ir , although this fraction drops to roughly a third in the optical .",
    "hence , bars are clearly an important feature to consider during structural decompositions .    as a demonstration of the impact of bars on allen et al.s ( 2006 ) bulge - disc decomposition results",
    "we derive alternative fits to a number of ( visually - classified ) strongly - barred galaxies in our two - component sample via multi - component ( srsic bulge plus srsic bar plus exponential disc ) fits with galfit version 2.0.3c @xcite .",
    "we note that while the truncated srsic profiles offered by the rival budda software package @xcite potentially enable a more faithful representation of bar light profiles ( and often provided the most satisfactory fits to mgc galaxies in informal tests ) , only galfit currently allows the input of user - generated psf functions necessary for fair comparisons with allen et al.s ( 2006 ) gim2d analysis .",
    "the real ( mgc ) and model ( gim2d and galfit ) , @xmath23-band images and surface brightness profiles of three example galaxies in which the addition of a bar component offered a superior fit are shown in fig .",
    "[ bars ] in the appendix . in each case",
    "the multi - component model fit returned a much lower bulge srsic index and b / t flux ratio than in the original , two - component model fit .",
    "thus , we recommend future , automated , bulge - disc decomposition studies incorporate the modeling of bars from the onset , despite the added complexity thereby introduced into quality control and interpretation of the output .",
    "we intend to explore the nature of bars in the mgc further in an upcoming paper ( cameron et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "finally , we note that late - type discs with bright knots of active star - formation also create a class of problematic fits .",
    "examples of the real ( mgc ) and model ( gim2d and galfit ) , @xmath23-band images and surface brightness profiles of three such galaxies are displayed in fig .",
    "[ starform ] in the appendix .",
    "a comparison is again made to alternative fits using galfit , but this time with only a two - component ( srsic bulge plus exponential disc ) model as these objects appear unbarred . despite the use of identical galaxy and psf models , galfit and gim2d return significantly different bulge structural parameters in two of these examples  a reflection of their differing fit algorithms .",
    "the presence of complex , irregular structure precludes clean fits with smooth elliptical isophote models , and identification of the global minimum becomes difficult . in the examples shown ,",
    "neither software package offers satisfactory output as each has accounted for some intermediate radius star - formation flux via the bulge model . the up - coming version of galfit ( v3.0 )",
    "will introduce features for mapping asymmetric , complex structure within the context of well - defined radial surface brightness profiles , and thus offers an exciting possibility for improved 2d bulge - disc decomposition of such galaxies .",
    "importantly , however , extensive visual inspection of galaxies in each of our key structural classes ( i.e. , elliptical , bulge - plus - disc , and disc - only ) indicates that the presence of unmodeled structural components very rarely results in a clear mis - classification .",
    "hence , we conclude that , although _ component _ bulge srsic indices and b / t flux ratios ( and hence colors ) for some fraction of our galaxies may be systematically biased , the presence of unmodeled bars and bright knots of active star - formation in the mgc @xmath23-band images will _ not _ affect our investigation of the role of galaxy structural type in shaping the _ global _ color - concentration bimodality .",
    "the global color - concentration distribution of bright ( @xmath0 mag ) , nearby ( @xmath35 ) , _ one - component _ galaxies in the mgc is presented in fig .",
    "[ global ] .",
    "this structural class displays strong bimodality , separating naturally in this parameter space into two distinct sub - populations ",
    "a ` red , highly - concentrated ' peak and a ` blue , diffuse ' peak  composed of elliptical and disc - only systems respectively .",
    "these peaks are evidently the foundations of those observed in the global color - concentration distribution of the full mgc population ( fig .  15 in @xcite ) , although their separation is more clearly defined in the absence of the two - component systems .",
    "we quantify this improvement in the apparent bimodality of the distribution by comparing the reduced-@xmath64 values resulting from least - squares fitting of pairs of bivariate gaussian functions to the observed global color - concentration distributions of _ one- and two - component galaxies _",
    "( @xmath71 ) and _ one - component galaxies only _ ( @xmath72 ) values represents a technically good fit as expected given that both peaks are slightly assymetric in shape , indicating intrinsic deviations from simple bivariate gaussian distributions .",

    "we also note that the total luminosity density of all structural types derived here , @xmath118",
    "@xmath5 @xmath119 mpc@xmath7 is similar to that for all structural components ( i.e. , bulges and discs ) derived by @xcite , @xmath120 @xmath5 @xmath119 mpc@xmath7 .",
    "both studies utilize the mgc structural catalogue , however , the total luminosity density obtained here is slightly smaller due largely to the reclassification of b / t @xmath32 0.6 galaxies as ellipticals ( intended to remove ` false discs ' ; see section [ false])when returned to the elliptical population these galaxies are no longer dust corrected , and hence become less luminous .",
    "we therefore also note the revised luminosity density of elliptical galaxies derived here , @xmath121",
    "@xmath5 @xmath119 mpc@xmath7 , which is higher than that recovered by @xcite , @xmath122 @xmath5 @xmath119 mpc@xmath7 .",
    "we also compute stellar mass densities using the model relationships between @xmath66 color and mass - to - light ratios given by @xcite .",
    "we thereby recover total stellar mass densities in each structural type of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath9 and @xmath8 @xmath123 @xmath5 @xmath6 mpc@xmath7 for elliptical , disc - only , red peak and bridging systems respectively .",
    "again we note that our total stellar mass density for all structural types , @xmath124 @xmath123 @xmath5 @xmath6 mpc@xmath7 , is similar to that recovered by @xcite for all structural components ( i.e. , bulges and discs ) in the mgc , @xmath125 @xmath123 @xmath5 @xmath6 mpc@xmath7 .",
    "the comparable luminosity and mass densities of one- and two - component systems revealed here highlights the importance of considering the fundamental distinction between elliptical , disc - only and bulge - plus - disc systems in order to properly understand galaxy formation and evolutionary processes .",
    "these luminosity functions by _ structural type _ , and those by separate _",
    "structural component _ presented in @xcite , offer valuable constraints for galaxy formation models , and should serve as key reference points for semi - analytical simulations .      in section [ results_global ]",
    "we demonstrated that the dichotomous disc - only and elliptical ( or ` bulge - only ' ) galaxy populations are the foundations of the bulge , low-@xmath14 and red , high-@xmath14 peaks of the global color - concentration bimodality , and that bulge - plus - disc galaxies span these two peaks  as expected given the correlation between global color - concentration and eyeball morphological type reported by @xcite .",
    "however , as noted by @xcite , driver et al.s ( 2006 ) hypothesis that the global properties of bulge - plus - disc systems are the result of mixing red , high-@xmath14 bulges and blue , low-@xmath14 discs in varying degrees is contradicted by the close relationship between bulge and disc colors @xcite . here",
    "we confirm this relationship for the bulge and disc colors of mgc two - component galaxies ( with ` confident ' colors ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ colors ] . in peletier & balcells ( 1996 ) study of 30 highly - inclined , s0-sbc galaxies the authors measured component colors via wedge - shaped apertures designed to avoid biases due to dust attentuation in the plane of each disc .",
    "they thereby measured a ( ` dust - free ' ) mean bulge - disc color offset of @xmath126 mag , or @xmath127 mag in an alternative filter combination .",
    "more recently , @xcite reported a substantially larger mean bulge - disc color difference of @xmath128 mag from an investigation of color gradients in a sample of 172 low - inclination , s0-sd / irr galaxies . in that study component colors",
    "were estimated from the average colors at radii of 0 - 0.5@xmath129 for bulges and 1.5 - 2.5@xmath129 for discs .",
    "@xcite speculated that their disagreement with peletier & balcells ( 1996 ) offset was either due to internal dust extinction , or a bias in the wedge - shaped aperture colors of the latter due to vertical gradients in stellar population age and metallicity within discs .",
    "here we recover an offset of @xmath130 mag using our dust attenuation corrected @xcite colors , which is indeed also larger than peletier & balcells ( 1996 ) offset and @xmath131 color differences based on the relevant filter transformation equations presented in blanton & roweis ( 2007 ) table 2 . ] . removing the dust correction from our red peak systems results in an even larger offset for that population of @xmath132 mag .",
    "our key conclusions may be summarized as follows . via bulge - disc decomposition and quantitative morphological classification ( i.e. , the logical filter in @xcite ) of luminous ( @xmath0 mag ) , nearby ( @xmath35 ) galaxies in the mgc",
    ", we have demonstrated that :    \\(i ) one - component systems ( predominantly elliptical and disc - only galaxies ) display strong bimodality in the color - concentration plane , contributing to a red , high srsic index peak and a blue , low srsic index peak respectively ( with total stellar mass densities of @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 mpc@xmath7 in each ) ;    \\(ii ) luminous , ` bulge - less , red discs ' and ` disc - less , blue bulges ' ( i.e. , blue ellipticals ) are rare ; ( with volume - densities of @xmath10 and @xmath8 @xmath3 @xmath11 @xmath12 mpc@xmath7 respectively ) ;        \\(v ) the two - component systems may be subdivided in a physically - motivated manner at @xmath134 into bridging ( late - type disc ) and red peak ( early - type disc ) populations ( with total stellar mass densities of @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 mpc@xmath7 in each ) .",
    "we now investigate how these results compare against other recent studies of galaxy structure , and discuss their interpretation within the hierarchical clustering scenario of galaxy formation , focussing on elliptical , disc - only , and bulge - plus - disc systems in turn .",
    "finally , we outline future work , and discuss the challenges facing future low resolution , automated structural decomposition campaigns .",
    "the red colors and highly centrally - concentrated light profiles of luminous ellipticals in the mgc are consistent with many other observational studies , including a large sample of elliptical galaxies in the sdss selected via a quantitative morphological approach and examined by @xcite .",
    "moreover , these properties are broadly consistent with the modern picture of hierarchical formation in which bright ellipticals are assembled at late epochs via ` dry mergers ' with other early - type systems @xcite",
    ". only their progenitors ( i.e. , lower luminosity / mass ellipticals ) are built up early via similar - sized disc mergers as in the original hierarchical model @xcite .",
    "the modern scenario is supported by direct observations of early - type mergers at intermediate redshifts @xcite , and n - body simulations confirming that ` dry mergers ' can reproduce the structural and kinematic properties of nearby ellipticals @xcite and preserve the fundamental plane @xcite .",
    "the ` dry merger ' scenario is also purported to account for the observed build up of mass on the red sequence since @xmath135 @xcite .",
    "however , studies showing minimal evolution of the early - type stellar mass - size relation @xcite  not preserved by ` dry merging ' @xcite  and constraints on the frequency of recent merging in luminous galaxies from pair counts and asymmetry indices @xcite challenge this hypothesis , suggesting a greater role for ( non - merger ) environmental processes in the recent evolution of the red sequence .",
    "the study of galaxy structure via automated bulge - disc decomposition of large , intermediate - to - high redshift datasets , followed by comparison against local samples such as the mgc , may enable the degeneracy between early - type , bulge - plus - disc ( s0 ) and predominantly elliptical ( e ) systems implicit in studies of the ` red sequence ' to be broken  thereby providing more accurate constraints on elliptical galaxy evolution .",
    "however , the handling of ` false disc ' candidates ( see section [ false ] ) requires improvement . in the meantime",
    ", the mgc elliptical population should serve as a key local benchmark , which semi - analytical models must be able to reproduce whilst simultaneously accounting for the properties of disc - only and bulge - plus - disc galaxies as well .",
    "the blue colors and diffuse ( i.e. , low-@xmath14 ) light profiles of predominantly disc - only systems in the mgc are also consistent with previous observations of disc - only galaxies , including a large sample of bulge - less , edge - on discs identified in the sdss by @xcite .",
    "these properties are also qualitatively consistent with expectations from the hierarchical formation scenario in which disc - dominated galaxies form early , but experience a passive evolutionary history @xcite .",
    "however , the prevalence of disc - only systems in the local universe is difficult to reconcile with the expected merger history of galaxies in cdm cosmologies . specifically , in our analysis of the mgc data we identify disc - only systems as contributing @xmath2430% of the total stellar mass in nearby disc galaxies , which is comparable to the number reported by @xcite . in a theoretical study of halo merger histories in a @xmath136cdm universe ,",
    "@xcite reveal that the observed frequency of bulgeless discs can only be reconciled within the hierarhical formation context provided spheroid production only occurs in mergers involving mass ratios greater than 0.3 .",
    "moreover , @xcite reveal equivalent limits on the frequency of minor mergers , which are expected to fuel central star - formation , leading to the creation of pseudobulges @xcite .    one may question whether these disc - only galaxies identified in the mgc are indeed entirely ` bulge - less ' , or whether they simply possess very faint ` bulges ' , insignificantly brighter in central surface brightness than the discs in which they are embedded .",
    "this is indeed possible given the limitations of our photometric decomposition pipeline @xcite , and we further note the potential for dust extinction to obscure compact bulges @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , even if a population of very faint bulges is hiding within our disc - only population , their properties are vastly different to those of the bright , high surface brightness classical bulges predicted by the hierarhical clustering model @xcite .",
    "we also note that in a high resolution study of 19 nearby late - type discs , @xcite observed that most of their sample could be well - fit using a single srsic profile model , and the vast majority of central flux excesses detected could not be attributed to ` what one would generally consider to be a bulge component ' .",
    "similarly , @xcite point out that of the four largest disc galaxies in the local group , two ( m33 and the lmc ) do not possess convincing classical bulges .    however , it is certainly important to account for observational limitations when comparing output from semi - analytical simulations against empirical datasets in order to derive robust conclusions .",
    "one example of how this may be achieved is the analysis pipeline developed by @xcite to generate realistic simulated galaxy images from model predictions , which may be used to compute ` observed ' structural parameters .",
    "the close relationship between the bulge and disc colors of two - component galaxies  as well as recent low resolution @xcite and high resolution studies @xcite revealing the disc - like nature of many blue _ and _ red bulges  points towards a scenario in which _ both _ secular evolution and merging play key roles in bulge formation , in contrast to the conventional hierarchical view @xcite .",
    "recent n - body simulations @xcite certainly indicate that secular evolutionary processes are efficient at establishing pseudobulge - like , central mass concentrations",
    ". however , the distinction between classical bulge and pseudobulge systems may not be as clear as is often suggested  based upon sauron observations of 24 sa / sab galaxies , @xcite report the co - existence of both an old , velocity - dispersion supported ` classical ' component and a young , rotationally - supported ` pseudobulge ' component within the nuclei of these early - type discs .",
    "high redshift observations offer some further important clues as to the formation pathways of bulge - plus - disc galaxies , although cosmic variance contributes a large source of uncertainty to the results .",
    "for instance , from the structural decomposition of 248 galaxies at @xmath137 , @xcite reveal that the correlation betweeen bulge and global color is in place by intermediate redshifts .",
    "they also identify 60% of their bulges as displaying red colors consistent with passively - evolving stellar populations , and 40% as displaying bluer colors indicative of more recent star - formation .",
    "they speculate that the formation of red bulges coincided with a truncation of galaxy star - formation that did not destroy the disc .",
    "indeed , the role of black hole and agn formation @xcite can not be overlooked in any complete model of bulge formation given the relationships between bulge and black hole properties @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the results of @xcite , @xcite report a much higher fraction ( 85% ) of red bulges at high redshift in their sample of 71 cluster and 21 field galaxies at @xmath138 , more consistent with a merger - built origin .",
    "however , the observed fraction is perhaps influenced by their selection of luminous bulges ( rather than simply globally luminous galaxies ) .",

    "<S> we reveal that one - component ( elliptical and disc - only ) systems define the two peaks of the galaxy color - concentration distribution ( with total stellar mass densities of @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 mpc@xmath7 respectively ) , while two - component systems contribute to both a bridging population and the red , concentrated peak ( with total stellar mass densities of @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 mpc@xmath7 respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , luminous , ` bulge - less , red discs ' and ` disc - less , blue bulges ' ( blue ellipticals ) are exceptionally rare ( with _ volume_-densities of @xmath10 and @xmath8 @xmath3 @xmath11 @xmath12 mpc@xmath7 respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , within the two - component population we confirm a previously - reported correlation between bulge and disc color ( with a mean offset of only @xmath13 mag ) . </S>"
