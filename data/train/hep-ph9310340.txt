    "so far very little is known about the electroweak symmetry - breaking - sector ( ewsbs ) , except it gives masses to the vector bosons via the spontaneous symmetry breaking , and masses to fermions via the yukawa couplings . in the minimal standard model ( sm )",
    "one scalar higgs boson is responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking but its mass is not determined by the model . if in the future no higgs boson is found below 800 gev , the heavy higgs scenario ( @xmath7 tev ) will imply a strongly interacting higgs sector because the higgs self - coupling @xmath8 becomes strong @xcite . however , there is no evidence to favor the model with a scalar higgs , and so any models that can break the electroweak symmetry the same way as the single higgs does can be a candidate for the ewsbs .",
    "one of the best ways to uncover the underlying dynamics of the ewsbs is to study the longitudinal vector boson scattering @xcite .",
    "the equivalence theorem ( et ) recalls , at high energy , the equivalence between the longitudinal part @xmath9 of the vector bosons to the corresponding goldstone bosons ( @xmath10 ) that were  eaten \" in the higgs mechanism .",
    "these goldstone bosons originate from the ewsbs so that their scattering must be via the interactions of the ewsbs , and therefore the @xmath11 scattering can reveal the dynamics of the ewsbs .    the strong @xmath11 scattering have been studied quite seriously at the hadronic supercolliders @xcite , but less at the @xmath12 colliders , and very little at the @xmath0 colliders . in hadronic colliders , only the  gold - plated \" modes , the leptonic decays of the @xmath4 and @xmath13 bosons , have been considered due to the messy hadronic backgrounds ; whereas in @xmath12 and @xmath0 colliders one can make use of the hadronic decay mode or mixed decay mode of the final state @xmath4 s or @xmath13 s . with the advance in the photon collider designs it is possible to construct an almost monochromatic @xmath0 collider based on the next generation linear @xmath12 colliders using the laser backscattering method @xcite .",
    "the monochromaticity of the photon beams depends on the polarizations of the initial electron and the laser photon .",
    "the polarizations of the initial electron and the laser photon can be adjusted to maximize the monochromaticity of the photon beam @xcite with a center - of - mass energy about 0.8 of the parent @xmath12 collider . hence",
    ", a 2 tev @xmath12 collider will give a 1.6 tev @xmath0 collider by the laser backscattering method .",
    "for the following we will assume a monochromatic @xmath0 collider of energy 1.5 tev with an integrated luminosity of 100  fb@xmath14 .",
    "studies of the strongly interacting ewsbs in @xmath0 collision have been considered previously in refs .",
    "@xcite . they all concentrate on @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath17 is almost three orders of magnitude larger than the @xmath18 signal .",
    "although we can improve the signal - to - background ratio by requiring the final state @xmath4 s away from the beam , it hardly reduces the @xmath19 background to the level of the @xmath18 signal . on the other hand ,",
    "both the @xmath20 signal and background are absent on tree level .",
    "but the box diagram contribution to @xmath3 has been shown to be very large at high @xmath21 region , and so the @xmath22 background is dominant over the @xmath16 signal in the search of the sm higgs with @xmath23 gev and in probing the other strong ewsb signals @xcite . as illustrated in refs .",
    "@xcite , the central part of interest is the @xmath24 or @xmath25 , but the effects of the strong ewsbs only come in on loop level in these processes so that the effects might not be so significant . in the following",
    "we present a new type of processes involving @xmath26 at @xmath0 colliders , schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ one ] @xcite .",
    "these @xmath18 scattering processes will be in analogy to the @xmath11 scattering considered at the hadronic supercolliders and @xmath12 colliders .",
    "the advantages of the processes in fig .",
    "[ one ] are that the @xmath18 scattering is no longer on loop level , and additional vector bosons in the final state can be tagged on to eliminate the large @xmath2 and @xmath22 backgrounds . in addition , both the @xmath27 and @xmath28 scattering can be studied in @xmath0 collision but only one of them can be studied in the @xmath12 or @xmath29 collisions . also any @xmath30 pair in the final state must come from the @xmath18 fusion because photon will not couple to @xmath13 on tree level .",
    "totally , we can study four scattering processes , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .    for simplification we will use the effective @xmath5 luminosity inside a photon in analogy to the effective @xmath4 approximation .",
    "this approximation will suffice for the purpose here for we will consider the kinematic region where the ewsbs will interact strongly , or in another words , in the large invariant mass region of the vector boson pair .",
    "the luminosity function of a @xmath5 inside a photon in the asymtotic energy limit is given by @xcite @xmath33\\,,\\ ] ] which is in analogy to the luminosity function @xmath34 of @xmath5 inside an electron .",
    "the first term in eq .",
    "( [ lum ] ) is approximately equal to the luminosity of @xmath5 inside an electron , and the logarithm factor will enhance the luminosity at high energy .",
    "this is the reason why the signal rates can be achieved higher than those in the @xmath12 colliders at the same energy .",
    "in this section , we will calculate the number of signal events predicted by some of the models that have been proposed for the ewsbs . in @xmath0 collision",
    "we can study the following subprocesses @xmath35 in analogy to the pion scattering in qcd , the scattering amplitudes of these processes can be expressed in terms of an amplitude function @xmath36 .",
    "their scattering amplitudes are then expressed as @xmath37 up to the symmetry factor of identical particles in the final state . the details of each model and the invariant amplitudes predicted by each model are summarized in ref .",
    "here we only give a brief account of these models .",
    "the models can be classified according to the spin and isospin of the resonance fields , and there are scalar - like , vector - like , and nonresonant models . for scalar - like models we will employ the standard model with a 1 tev higgs , @xmath38 model with the cutoff @xmath39  tev , and the model with a chirally - coupled scalar of mass @xmath40  tev and width @xmath41  gev . for the vector - like models we choose the chirally - coupled vector field ( technirho ) of masses @xmath42 , 1.2 , and 1.5  tev , and @xmath43 , 0.5 , and 0.6  tev respectively . in the case of no light resonances we use the amplitudes predicted by the low energy theorem ( let ) and",
    "extrapolate them to high energies .",
    "each of the @xmath11 scattering amplitudes grows with energy until reaching the resonances , _",
    "e.g. _ sm higgs boson of the minimal sm .",
    "the presence of the resonances ( scalar or vector ) is the natural unitarization to the scattering amplitudes , except there might be slight violation of unitarity around the resonance peak .",
    "after the resonance , the scattering amplitudes will stay below the unitarity limit .",
    "but for the nonresonant models the unitarity is likely to be saturated before reaching the lightest resonance .",
    "here we employ the let amplitude function , @xmath44 , for the nonresonant models . from the partial wave analysis , the only nonzero partial wave coefficients",
    "@xmath45 are @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 . among the nonzero @xmath45 s",
    ", @xmath46 saturates the unitarity ( @xmath49 ) at the lowest energy @xmath50  tev .",
    "so for the @xmath0 colliders of 1.5 tev , unitarity violation should not be a problem , therefore , we simply extrapolate the let amplitudes without any unitarization .",
    "we show the number of signal events predicted by these models for each scattering channel in table  [ table1 ] , with @xmath51  tev and integrated luminosity of 100  fb@xmath14 , and under the acceptance cuts of @xmath52 one interesting thing to note here is that different channel is sensitive to different new physics .",
    "if the underlying dynamics of the ewsbs is scalar - like the signal is more likely to be found in the @xmath53 channel , and next at the @xmath30 channel , due to the presence of @xmath54 scalars .",
    "but if the underlying dynamics is vector - like the signal in the @xmath55 channel will be far more important that the @xmath16 channel . on the other hand , if no light resonances are within reach the @xmath30 channel has the largest signal rate , and next is the @xmath56 channels .",
    "so by counting the number of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath16 pairs in the final state one can tell the different structure of the ewsbs @xcite .",
    "but to distinguish a @xmath4 from a @xmath13 by the dijet mass measurement is not a trivial issue , though we can use the @xmath59-tagging to distinguish a @xmath4 from a @xmath13 somehow . for",
    "a discussion on this subject please see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the number of signal events in table  [ table1 ] does not include any detection efficiencies of the @xmath5 s coming out from the strong scattering region , nor the tagging efficiencies for the spectator @xmath4 s .",
    "the tagging efficiencies for the spectator @xmath4 s will be dealt with in the next section .",
    "the detection efficiencies of the @xmath5 s consist of the branching ratios of the @xmath5 into jets or leptons , and the tagging efficiencies of these decay products . the branching ratio br(@xmath60br@xmath61 . assuming a 30% ( reasonable to pessimistic ) tagging efficiencies for the decay products",
    ", we have about 15% overall detection efficiencies for the @xmath18 coming out from the strong scattering region .",
    "so far we have not considered any backgrounds nor background suppression techniques . in our calculation",
    ", we use the effective @xmath5 luminosity which does not predict the correct kinematics for the spectator @xmath4 s , and therefore any acceptance cuts on the spectator @xmath4 s will be unrealistic .",
    "however , we need to tag at least one or both of these spectator @xmath4 s in order to eliminate the enormous @xmath62 backgrounds . one way to remedy is to carry out an exact sm calculation of @xmath63 or @xmath64 with a heavy higgs boson , and estimate the acceptance efficiencies on tagging the spectator @xmath4 s , and then apply these efficiencies to the other models which can only be calculated using the effective @xmath5 luminosity .",
    "however , the calculations of the processes @xmath63 or @xmath64 are non - trivial . instead",
    ", we can obtain the tagging efficiencies by calculating a simpler process @xmath65 for @xmath661 tev , with and without imposing acceptance cuts on the final state @xmath4 s .",
    "we will calculate the total cross section for @xmath67 without any cuts , and also the cross section with the acceptance cuts @xmath68 on either one or both of the @xmath4 s .",
    "the cross sections are presented in table  [ table2 ] for @xmath69  tev .",
    "there are two tagging efficiencies corresponding to tagging at least one or both of the spectator @xmath4 s . from table",
    "[ table2 ] , if we require the spectator @xmath4 s within a rapidity of @xmath70 the tagging efficiencies are 91% and 42% for tagging at least one or both the @xmath4 s respectively . to eliminate the @xmath2 or @xmath71 backgrounds we need only tag one of the spectator @xmath4 s plus the @xmath5 s from the strong scattering .",
    "a further confirmation by tagging two spectator @xmath4 s will result in an efficiency of only 42% .",
    "but if we tag both spectator @xmath4 s within the rapidity @xmath72 the double - tag efficiency increases to 82% .",
    "this drastic difference of the double - tag efficiencies between rapidity cut of 1.5 and 2 demonstrates that it is likely ( 40% chance ) to have at least one spectator @xmath4 in the forward rapidity region @xmath73 .",
    "next we can multiply these efficiencies to the numbers in table  [ table1 ] to get a more reliable number of signal events when the spectator @xmath4 s are tagged .",
    "taking into account of the 15% ( from the last section ) detection efficiency for the @xmath11 plus the tagging efficiency of at least one or both of the spectator @xmath4 s , we still have at least 10% overall efficiency . with 10% efficiency we still have a sizeable number of signal events .",
    "scalar - type models will be shown up in the @xmath74 channel with at least 47 events .",
    "the vector - like models will also be shown up in the @xmath74 channel if the vector resonance is within reach of the energy of the @xmath0 collider .",
    "for nonresonant models we have about 15 events for the @xmath75 channels and 17 events for @xmath76 channel .",
    "the continuum productions of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , together with the heavy quark production of @xmath77 followed by the top decays into @xmath4 s , form the irreducible set of backgrounds .",
    "they are the sm predictions that any significant excess of @xmath11 or @xmath16 events will indicate some kinds of new physics for the ewsbs .",
    "the other reducible backgrounds include the productions of @xmath4 s with jets , @xmath13 s with jets , and multi - jet .",
    "the @xmath78 and @xmath64 productions are of order @xmath79 , and so should be at most the same level as our strong @xmath11 signal .",
    "although the @xmath80 background is @xmath81 larger than the @xmath78 background , we can to certain extent reduce it by reconstructing the top and by imposing the top - mass constraints .",
    "the other qcd backgrounds of @xmath4 s or @xmath13 s with jets are reducible by the @xmath4 or @xmath13 mass constraints .",
    "in addition , we can make use of the kinematics of the spectator @xmath4 s and the strongly scattered @xmath5 s @xcite .",
    "the @xmath82 of the spectator @xmath4 s should be of order @xmath83 after the photon emits an almost on - shell @xmath5 , which then participates in the strong scattering .",
    "also , as mentioned in the last section , at least one of the spectator @xmath4 s tend to go forward in the rapidity region @xmath84 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath11 after the strong scattering come out in the central rapidity region with large @xmath82 and large invariant mass , and back - to - back in the transverse plane , which are all due to the strong interaction of the ewsbs .",
    "but it is hardly true for the backgrounds .",
    "acceptance cuts can be formulated based on the above arguments to substantially reduce the backgrounds @xcite .    in conclusions",
    ", we have demonstrated another type of processes in @xmath0 collision that can probe the strongly interacting ewsbs scenario .",
    "the processes do not involve the indirect loop effects , and also are safe from the huge @xmath2 or @xmath22 backgrounds due to the presence of the spectator @xmath4 s .",
    "even with only 10% overall efficiency we still have enough signal events with 100  fb@xmath14 luminosities .",
    "irreducible backgrounds from @xmath78 , @xmath64 , and @xmath80 can be reduced by considering the special kinematics of the strongly scattered @xmath5 s and the spectator @xmath4 s .",
    "other reducible backgrounds are reduced by the mass constraints .",
