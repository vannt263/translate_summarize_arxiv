    "while transverse distribution for intensity and polarization of cr beam look different for the @xmath8 case with respect to @xmath14 , it should be noted that singularities , i.e. topological structure of the cr beam , remains similar .",

    "if we consider the special case of @xmath92 , the central point at the focal plane is a null - intensity point and therefore all stokes parameters are also 0 at the beam center .",
    "vanishing intensity at the beam center leads to another feature .",
    "namely , sign of circular polarization state associated with stokes parameter @xmath71 is reversed at the focal plane with respect to the input beam .",
    "it means that at the focal plane the cr beam is predominantly of lhcp in the case of rhcp of the input beam we consider in this paper ( see first row in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for the case of @xmath92 ) .",

    "additional features of focused cr beams are associated with gouy phase .",
    "it can be revealed by considering evolution of transverse pattern for stokes parameters along cr beam propagation shown in link : media3.avi[supplement 3]link : media8.avi[supplement 8 ] for a rhcp and lp ( @xmath65 ) gaussian input beam for @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 . for rhcp input light ( link : media3.avi[supplement 3 ] , link : media5.avi[supplement 5 ] , link : media7.avi[supplement 7 ] ) the focal plane ( @xmath40 )",
