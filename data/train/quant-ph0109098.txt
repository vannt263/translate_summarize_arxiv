    "in classical computing the programming is based on commands written in the machine language .",
    "each command is translated into manipulations of the considered device , obtained by electronic switches . in quantum computation",
    "quantum mechanics is employed to process information .",
    "therefore the conception of the quantum computer programming , the structure of the quantum machine language and the commands are expected to be quite different from the classical case .",
    "although there are differences between classical and quantum computers , the programming in both cases should be based on commands , and a part of these commands is realized by quantum gates .",
    "initially , one of the leading ideas in quantum computation was the introduction of the notion of the universal gate @xcite . given the notion of a universal set of elementary gates , various physical implementations of a quantum computer have been proposed @xcite . naturally , in order for an implementation to qualify as a valid quantum computer , all the set of elementary gates have to be implemented by the proposed system .",
    "this property is related to the problem of controllability of the quantum computer.the controllability of quantum systems is an open problem under investigation @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite attention was focused on the notion of encoded universality , which is a different functional approach to the quantum computation . instead of forcing a physical system to act as a predetermined set of universal gates , which will be connected by quantum connections , the focus of research is proposed to be shifted to the study of the intrinsic ability of a given physical system , to act as a quantum computer using only its natural available interactions .",
    "therefore the quantum computers are rather a collection of interacting cells ( e.g. quantum dots , nuclear spins , josephson junctions etc ) .",
    "these cells are controlled by external classical switches and they evolve in time by modifying the switches .",
    "the quantum algorithms are translated into time manipulations of the external classical switches which control the system .",
    "this kind of quantum computer does not have connections , which is the difficult part of a physical implementation .",
    "any device operating by external classical switches has an internal range of capabilities , i.e. it can manipulate the quantum information encoded in a subspace of the full system of hilbert space .",
    "this capability is called encoded universality of the system @xcite .",
    "the notion of the encoded universality is identical to the notion of the controllability @xcite of the considered quantum device .",
    "the controllability on lie groups from a mathematical point of view was studied in @xcite .",
    "the controllability of atomic and molecular systems was studied by several authors see review article @xcite and the special issue of the _ chemical physics _ vol .",
    "267 , devoted to this problem . in the case of laser systems",
    "the question of controllability was studied by several authors and recently in @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the conditions in order to obtain the full system of hilbert space by a finite number of choices of the values of the classical switches . as a working example we use the josephson junction devices in their simplest form @xcite , but this study can be extended in the case of quantum dots or nmr devices .    in this paper the intrinsic interaction of a system operating as a universal computer is employed instead of forcing the system to enact a predetermined set of universal gates @xcite . as a basic building block we use a system of two identical josephson junctions coupled by a mutual inductor .",
    "the values of the classical control parameters ( the charging energy @xmath0 and the inductor energy @xmath1 ) are chosen in such a way that four basic hamiltonians , @xmath2,(@xmath3 ) are created by switching on and off the bias voltages and the inductor , where the tunneling amplitude @xmath4 is assumed to be fixed .",
    "our procedure allows the construction of any one - qubit and two - qubit gate , through a finite number of steps evolving in time according to the four basic hamiltonians . using the two josephson junctions network a construction scheme of four steps for the simulation",
    "is presented in the case of an arbitrary one - qubit gate , and of fifteen steps , for the simulation of an arbitrary two - qubit gate .",
    "the main idea of this paper is the use of a small number of hamiltonian states in order to obtain the gates .",
    "our results can be formulated in terms of a _ quantum machine language_. for example , each two - qubit gate @xmath5 is represented by a _ command _ of the language containing 15 _ letters _ i.e. the fifteen steps mentioned above .",
    "each letter consists of a binary part ( the states of the on - off switches ) , which determines the basic hamiltonian used , and a numerical part corresponding to the time interval .",
    "our proposal can be generalized for @xmath6-qubit gates ( @xmath7 ) belonging to the @xmath8 . in that case @xmath9",
    "basic hamiltonians are needed to implement such a gate .",
    "the generalization of these ideas is under investigation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : one_qubit ] we present for clarity reasons the formalism of josephson junctions one - qubit devices . in section [ sec : two_qubit ] we apply the formalism to two qubit gates and simulate two - qubit gates and the possible @xmath6-qubit generalizations are discussed . in section [ sec : summary ]",
    "the results are summarized .",
    "finally in the appendix [ sec : appendix ] , the essential mathematical feedback is provided .",
    "the simplest josephson junction one qubit device is shown in fig [ fig : one_qbit ] . in this section",
    "we give a summary of the considered device .",
    "the detailed description and the complete list of references can be found in the detailed review paper @xcite .",
    "the device consists of a small superconducting island ( `` box '' ) , with @xmath10 excess cooper pair charges connected by a tunnel junction with capacitance @xmath11 and josephson coupling energy @xmath12 to a superconducting electrode . a control gate voltage @xmath13 ( ideal voltage source )",
    "is coupled to the system via a gate capacitor @xmath14 .",
    "the chosen material is such that the superconducting energy gap is the largest energy in the problem , larger even than the single - electron charging energy . in",
    "this case quasi - particle tunneling is suppressed at low temperatures , and a situation can be reached where no quasi - particle excitation is found on the island . under special condition described in ref @xcite only cooper pairs tunnel coherently in the superconducting junction .",
    "the voltage @xmath15 is constrained in a range interval where the number of cooper pairs takes the values @xmath16 and @xmath17 , while all other coherent charge states , having much higher energy , can be ignored .",
    "these charge states correspond to the spin basis states : +    [ cols= \" < \" , ]      + in this case the superconducting charge box reduces to a two - state quantum system , _ qubit _ , with hamiltonian ( in spin 1/2 notation ) : @xmath18 in this hamiltonian there are two parameters the _ bias energy _ @xmath19 and the _ tunneling amplitude _ @xmath4 .",
    "the bias energy @xmath19 is controlled by the gate voltage @xmath15 of fig [ fig : one_qbit ] , while the tunneling amplitude @xmath4 here is assumed to be constant i.e. it is a constant system parameter .",
    "the tunneling amplitude can be controlled in the case of the tunable effective josephson junction , where the single josephson junction is replaced by a flux - threaded squid @xcite , but this device is more complicated than the one considered in this paper .",
    "the hamiltonian is written as : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the mixing angle @xmath22 the energy eigenvalues are @xmath23 and the splitting between the eigenstates is : @xmath24    the eigenstates provided by the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_basic ] ) , are denoted in the following as @xmath25 and @xmath26 : @xmath27    to avoid confusion we introduce a second set of pauli matrices @xmath28 , which operate in the basis @xmath25 , @xmath26 ,",
    "while reserving the @xmath29 operators for the basis of @xmath30 and @xmath31 : @xmath32    in the proposed model we assume that the device of fig [ fig : one_qbit ] has a switch taking two values @xmath17 and @xmath16 , corresponding to the switch states _ on _ and _ off_. this switch controls the gate voltage @xmath15 , which takes only two values either @xmath33 or @xmath34 , where the first one corresponds to the _ idle hamiltonian _ , while the second one corresponds to the _ degenerate hamiltonian_.    the _ idle _ point can be achieved for a characteristic value of the control gate voltage @xmath35 , corresponding to a special value of the bias energy and to the phase parameter @xmath36 . at this point",
    "the energy splitting @xmath37 achieves its maximum value , which is denoted by @xmath38 . for simplicity reasons we reserve the symbol @xmath19 for the bias energy corresponding to the idle point and by definition , the hamiltonian at the _ idle point _",
    "then becomes : @xmath39    at the _ degeneracy _ point @xmath40 the energy splitting reduces to @xmath12 , which is the minimal energy splitting .",
    "this point is characteristic for the material of the josephson junction and corresponds to a special characteristic choice of the control gate voltage @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42    the system is switched in the state _ off _ ( or @xmath16 ) corresponding to the _ degenerate _ hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_deg ] ) during a time interval @xmath43 , then the system is switched to the state _ on _ ( or @xmath17 ) i.e. the _ idle _ hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_idle ] ) during a time interval @xmath44 and it comes back to the initial _ degenerate _ hamiltonian during the time @xmath45 .",
    "the general form of the evolution operator is : @xmath46    the operators @xmath47 and @xmath48 and their commutator @xmath49= i \\frac{e_c e_j}{2 } \\sigma_y\\ ] ] form a ( non - orthogonal ) basis of the algebra @xmath50 .",
    "therefore the pair @xmath51 generates @xmath50 by taking these elements and all their possible commutators and their linear combinations .",
    "that means that the combination of three terms as in equation ( [ eq : one_qbit_evol ] ) for all the triples @xmath52 cover all the matrices belonging in @xmath53 .",
    "thus we conclude that every 2@xmath542 matrix @xmath5 in @xmath53 can be achieved by a device as in fig [ fig : one_qbit ] , with manipulation of the binary switch permitting to the hamiltonian two possible states i.e. the _ idle _ one and the _ degenerate _ one .",
    "the above described manipulations can be codified by a rudimentary _ quantum machine language _ ( qml ) for the one qubit device . in that elementary language",
    "the gate @xmath5 corresponds to a _ command _ of the language , each command is constituted by ( three ) letters , each of them having the form of a pair @xmath55 i.e. the command corresponding to equation ( [ eq : one_qbit_evol ] ) is analyzed in the following ( at most three ) letters : @xmath56 the one qubit gates are @xmath57 unitary matrices belonging to the group u(2 ) .",
    "each element in the group @xmath58 can be projected up to one multiplication constant to an element of group @xmath53 .",
    "evidently the elements generated by the evolution operator ( [ eq : one_qbit_evol ] ) belong to @xmath53 . throughout this paper",
    "we shall use projections of @xmath59 matrices in @xmath60 , using the symbol `` @xmath61 '' to denote this projection .",
    "let us consider the fundamental one qubit gates or commands not , @xmath62 , hadamard , phase shift and their @xmath53 projections : @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 where @xmath66+\\frac{\\pi}{2 } \\right)}{e_j},\\ ] ] @xmath67+\\pi\\right)}{\\delta e}\\ ] ] @xmath68 where @xmath69+\\frac{\\pi}{2 } \\right)}{e_{j } } , \\end{array}\\ ] ] @xmath70 \\right)}{\\delta e}\\ ] ]    the above formulas imply the following analysis of these commands in letters ( table [ tab : one ] ) .",
    "@xmath71    the above analysis of a quantum gate in letters is rather trivial in the one qubit case and it was presented for clarity reasons , but the similar construction is far from evident and quite complicated in the @xmath6-qubit case .",
    "in order to perform one and two qubit quantum gate manipulations in the same device , we need to couple pairs of qubits together and to control the interaction between them . for this purpose",
    "identical josephson junctions are coupled by one mutual inductor @xmath72 as shown in fig [ fig : two_qubit ] .",
    "the physics and the detailed description of the coupled josephson junctions are discussed and reviewed in @xcite . for @xmath73",
    "the system reduces to a series of uncoupled , single qubits , while for @xmath74 they are coupled strongly .",
    "the ideal system would be one where the coupling between different qubits could be switched in the state _ on _ ( or state @xmath75 ) by applying an induction via a constant value inductor @xmath72 and in the state _ off _ ( or state @xmath76 ) corresponding to @xmath73 and leaving the qubits uncoupled in the _ idle _ state .",
    "the hamiltonian for a general two - qubit system is written : @xmath77 for an explanation of the formalism used in this section see appendix [ sec : appendix ] . in the case of two identical junctions",
    "we have @xmath78 , since the tunneling amplitude of the junction is a system parameter , depending on the material . under these conditions",
    "the two coupled josephson junctions hamiltonian will be controlled by the following control parameters : @xmath79 , which will be called _",
    "switches_. the first two parameters are controlled by the gate voltages @xmath80 , while the last parameter is related to the inductor switch @xmath72 . in the proposed model",
    "each of the parameters @xmath81 can have two values @xmath16 or @xmath19 .",
    "the first is the state @xmath76 ( or @xmath82 ) corresponding to the _ degenerate _ one qubit state , while the other one is equal to @xmath19 ( or @xmath83 or @xmath75 state ) corresponding to the one qubit _ idle _ state .",
    "also the parameter @xmath1 takes two values .",
    "the one is @xmath84 ( @xmath82 or @xmath76 state ) corresponding to a an uncoupled two qubit state and the other one has a fixed value ( @xmath83 or @xmath75 state ) . for the sake of simplicity we use the symbol @xmath1 for this induction amplitude . using this combination of parameter values or binary switches values ,",
    "we can obtain the following four fundamental states of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h2_general ] ) :    * where both of the junctions are in the idle state @xmath85 , while they are uncoupled @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath87 this hamiltonian corresponds to the switches choice @xmath88 . * where both of the junctions are in the degenerate state @xmath89 , while the two qubits are coupled .",

    "the second is in the degeneracy @xmath97 and they are uncoupled @xmath86 . @xmath98 corresponding to the switch choice @xmath99 .",
    "these four hamiltonian forms are linearly independent and they can generate the su@xmath100 algebra by repeated commutations and linear combinations . for a detailed discussion see the discussion in appendix [ sec : appendix ] , equation ( [ eq : sigmatoh ] ) . from proposition [ prop : su4 ] , any elementary two - qubit gate , which is represented by a unitary @xmath101 matrix @xmath102su@xmath100 , can be constructed as follows : @xmath103 from a physical point of view any two qubit quantum gate can be obtained by 15 time steps . at the k - th step the device",

    "using this fact a _ quantum machine language _ ( qml ) can be defined as in section [ sec : one_qubit ] .",
    "each gate , corresponding to the @xmath101 matrix @xmath5 , is associated to a _ command _ of the qml .",
    "each command consists of at most @xmath107 _ letters _ or steps , each of them being a collection of @xmath108 numbers @xmath109 of the following form : @xmath110 the gate @xmath5 given by equation ( [ eq : impl_uni ] ) corresponds to one _ command _ , which contains @xmath107 letters and is presented in table [ tab : u ] .",
    "each _ letter _ is the codified command which indicates the state of the binary switches and the time interval .",
    "@xmath111    we should notice that the succession of switch states follows a cyclic pattern .",
    "this regularity might facilitate the manipulation of the coupled junction device .",
    "let us now give some numerical simulations of the proposed model for some fundamental quantum gates essential for the quantum computation ( we use these gates multiplied with a proper constant because the corresponding matrices should be elements of the @xmath112 group ) .",

    "this gate provides a conditional phase shift @xmath117 on the second qubit ( adds a phase to the second qubit ) : @xmath118 in our analysis we consider this phase to be @xmath119 .    in the simulations of this paper ,",
