    "extensive studies of local active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have led to a unification paradigm wherein continuum and broad - line emission from the active nucleus are hidden from some lines of sight by an optically thick medium@xcite . at such orientations , agn lack broad emission lines or a bright continuum and are called type  2 agn ( e.g. , seyfert  2 galaxies ) ; usually they have strongly absorbed x - ray spectra as well .",
    "a population of these obscured agn out to redshift 2 - 3 has been invoked to explain the x - ray `` background '' @xcite .",
    "recent deep surveys with @xmath9 and xmm have resolved most or all of this background , and thus must contain high - redshift , obscured agn @xcite .",
    "obscured agn are needed to explain the spectral shape of the x - ray background @xcite since the average observed agn spectrum @xcite is much harder than the typical x - ray spectrum of an unobscured agn @xcite . because strong absorption of the ultraviolet and soft x - ray emission dramatically hardens the observed spectrum of obscured agn ,",
    "population synthesis models involving large numbers of obscured agn have been very successful at matching the x - ray background intensity and spectrum ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the main prediction of population synthesis models , namely that a combination of obscured and unobscured agn constitute the x - ray background , has been borne out by deep x - ray observations @xcite . however , the observed redshift distribution of x - ray sources in deep surveys is peaked at lower redshift than these models require .",
    "specifically , @xcite predict a peak in the redshift distribution at @xmath10 , and a ratio of obscured to unobscured agn that rises from 4:1 locally to 10:1 at @xmath11 .",
    "however , optical spectroscopy of x - ray sources in the @xmath9 deep fields and the lockman hole indicates a redshift peak at @xmath12 , and only twice as many obscured agn as unobscured @xcite .",
    "because few type  2 agn are known at redshifts @xmath13 , where agn are most numerous , it had been suggested that they do not exist , perhaps because the obscuring torus of gas and dust evaporates at high luminosity @xcite .",
    "now , with deep x - ray surveys , a few such objects have clearly been found ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to note that uv - excess or optical emission - line surveys would not have found most obscured agn , nor would soft x - ray surveys such as the rosat all - sky @xcite or the white , giommi & angelini ( wga ; @xcite ) surveys .",
    "instead , one needs to look at hard x - rays , where the absorption is smaller , or in the far infrared , where the absorbed energy is re - radiated .    discovering a previously undiscovered population of obscured agn",
    " a population suggested by the hardness of the x - ray background  was a strong motivation for the great observatories origins deep survey .",
    "goods consists of deep imaging in the far infrared with the @xmath6 space telescope @xcite and in the optical with the hubble space telescope @xcite on the footprints of the two deepest @xmath9 fields ( @xcite;@xcite , hereafter a03 ) .",
    "the total area is roughly 60 times larger than the original hubble deep field @xcite and nearly as deep in the optical .",
    "the great observatories data were augmented with ground - based imaging and spectroscopy . with extensive coverage over 5 decades in energy from 24  @xmath8 m to 8  kev ( @xmath14    ) ,",
    "this survey is well suited to find a high - redshift population of obscured agn if they exist .",
    "a complementary approach , given the relatively low surface density of agn ( compared to normal galaxies ) , is to target higher luminosity agn over a wider area of the sky , an approach followed by , for example , the chandra multiwavelength project ( champ ; @xcite ) , calan - yale deep extragalactic research ( cyder ; @xcite ) , serendipitous extragalactic x - ray source identification program ( sexsi ; @xcite ) and the high - energy large - area survey 2 ( hellas2xmm ; @xcite ) surveys .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the agn populations detected in the x - ray and optical in the goods north and south fields . assuming a simple unification scheme , in which roughly three - quarters of all agn are obscured at all redshifts , we explain the optical magnitude , hard x - ray flux , and redshift distributions of goods agn .",
    "this model is compatible with previous population syntheses models for the x - ray background .",
    "we also use this model to predict the number counts and redshift distribution of agn that will be detected with @xmath6 in the goods fields .",
    "these predictions differ from similar calculations by @xcite in that we include agn evolution , which has a very strong effect , changing the counts by 2 orders of magnitude at the wavelengths of interest .    in ",
    "2 we outline the procedure used to derive the number counts and redshift distributions at various wavelengths , and specify the agn luminosity function and spectral energy distributions used , which are appropriate to the unification paradigm and are based on a combination of observation and theory .",
    "results are discussed in   3 , and compared to observations in the goods fields . in   4 we present predictions for the @xmath6 observations at 24 , 8 and 3.6 microns and discuss definitive tests for the obscured population .",
    "conclusions are given in ",
    "5 . throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath15 km s @xmath16 mpc@xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "to derive the number counts at any wavelength we start with a hard x - ray luminosity function , an assumed cosmic evolution , and a library of spectral energy distributions .",
    "we use the hard x - rays as a starting point because observations at 2 - 10  kev in the rest frame are less affected by obscuration and therefore provide a less biased view of the agn population , although they are still biased against detection of heavily absorbed sources ( @xmath19  @xmath1 ) .",
    "the intrinsic x - ray luminosity of each agn is then related to its observed x - ray flux via its @xmath20 value and intrinsic x - ray spectral index .",
    "hard x - ray surveys are heavily dominated by agn and thus make agn very easy to identify .",
    "although far - infrared emission can be even less biased , since the optical depth of the obscuring matter is low and the dust emission is quasi - isotropic @xcite , such surveys have a very low yield of agn because normal galaxies are also strong far - infrared sources and are far more numerous .",
    "hard x - ray luminosity functions based on compilations of deep @xmath9 , rosat , heao-1 and asca observations have been published recently by ueda et al .",
    "( 2003;u03 in what follows ) and @xcite .",
    "we use the work of u03 , based on 247 agn selected in the hard x - ray band in deep fields like the lockman hole and the @xmath9 deep field north .",
    "this sample covers the x - ray flux range from @xmath21 to @xmath22 erg  @xmath1  s@xmath16 in the @xmath23  kev band .",
    "the luminosity function refers to the rest - frame absorption - corrected x - ray luminosity .",
    "the dependence of the luminosity function on the column density is calculated separately using an `` @xmath20 function '' presented in equation  6 of u03 , which is based on the relative number of sources at each @xmath20 observed in their sample .",
    "the number of sources per unit volume per unit of @xmath24 and per unit of @xmath25 is ( u03 ) :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the luminosity function , which also includes evolution with redshift , @xmath28 is the observed neutral hydrogen column density distribution and @xmath29 is the co - moving volume as a function of redshift , which depends on the adopted cosmology .",
    "we also adopt the luminosity - dependent density evolution model of u03 , in which low - luminosity sources peak at lower redshift than high - luminosity agn .",
    "this is compatible with evolution calculated in the optical bands by @xcite , which peaks at redshift @xmath30 ( but includes only high luminosity objects ) .",
    "we refer the reader to u03 for more details about the hard x - ray luminosity function .    the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) described in   [ sed ] give the agn luminosity at any wavelength .",
    "we use the number density in eqn .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) to generate a population of objects spanning the following ranges of @xmath31 and @xmath20 : @xmath32  @xmath1 and @xmath33  ergs  s@xmath16 .",
    "we calculate the number counts at any given wavelength by summing sources of the same observed flux at that wavelength , and scaling the result to the total area .",
    "we book keep this calculation separately for different populations , for example , unobscured and obscured agn , adopting @xmath34  @xmath1 as the dividing point between the two classes ( as do u03 ) .",
    "the combination of the u03 luminosity function ( version appropriate for our cosmology ; see table  3 in u03 ) , @xmath20 function , and the agn seds described in the next section will be called model a in what follows .",
    "the rest - frame spectrum of an agn depends strongly on the intrinsic luminosity of the central engine and the amount of obscuration along the line of sight . in the simple unification model considered here ,",
    "the obscuring matter is distributed in an axially symmetric geometry which , assuming random orientations of the symmetry axis , dictates the distribution of neutral hydrogen column density , @xmath20 .",
    "the obscuring gas and dust both absorbs and emits radiation ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , conserving energy when integrated over all angles .",
    "we construct agn seds from x - rays to the far infrared as a function of two parameters , namely the intrinsic x - ray luminosity in the 2 - 10 kev band and the line - of - sight column density of neutral hydrogen , @xmath20 .",
    "we consider three separate wavelength regions  x - rays , optical / uv , and infrared  then merge the components with appropriate normalizations . specifically the seds are constructed as follows :    *",
    "the intrinsic relation between x - ray and uv luminosity @xcite was used to normalize the unobscured optical agn spectrum , which is taken from the sdss composite quasar spectrum @xcite .",
    "* absorption was then added to both the x - ray and uv / optical parts of the spectrum . in x - rays photoelectric absorption was assumed , while in the uv / optical milky - way type reddening laws were used , with a standard galactic dust - to - gas ratio to convert @xmath20 into optical extinction ( see   2.2.1 and 2.2.2 for details ) . *",
    "an @xmath35 ( @xmath36 mag ) elliptical host galaxy was added to the optical agn spectrum . in the most obscured sources",
    ", the host galaxy dominates the rest - frame optical - near - ir spectrum .",
    "see   2.2.2 for details .",
    "* the value of @xmath20 for the infrared dust emission models of @xcite was related to the angle between the equatorial plane of the agn and the line of sight for a simple torus geometry (   2.2.3 ) . * the infrared spectra for different angles are normalized at @xmath37 m , where the emission from the agn is roughly isotropic @xcite , and the infrared spectrum for the appropriate angle ( i.e. , @xmath20 value ) is added to the agn spectrum .",
    "details are presented in   2.2.3 .",
    "this composite spectrum is shifted to the desired redshift and the change in the sed of the host galaxy caused by passive stellar evolution is included ( see   2.2.2 ) .",
    "examples of the final composite seds for some of the x - ray luminosities and @xmath20 values used in this calculation are shown in figure  [ seds ] .",
    "two known agn , the type  1 quasar pg0804 + 761 ( @xmath38 , @xmath39  @xmath1 ; @xcite ) and the seyfert  2 galaxy ngc 7582 ( @xmath40,@xmath41  @xmath1 ; @xcite ) agree well with the appropriate model seds , as shown in figure  [ local_seds ] .",
    "note that once @xmath20 and redshift ( and thus luminosity ) are specified , there are no free parameters to adjust the fit to the data .",
    "the effective broad - band power - law spectral slope , @xmath42 , is defined as :    @xmath43}{\\log [ \\nu(j)/\\nu(i ) ] } ~,\\ ] ]    where @xmath44 is the rest - frame flux density and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the frequencies of interest . for our spectral models ,",
    "a source with an unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of @xmath47  ergs  s@xmath16 and @xmath48  @xmath1 has @xmath49 , while a low - luminosity agn with @xmath50  ergs  s@xmath16 and mild obscuration , @xmath34  @xmath1 , has @xmath51 ( taking 2500    and 2  kev as the fiducial points ) .",
    "both values are well within the observed range , while the average of our model distribution is very similar to the average observed values @xcite .",
    "similarly , the values of @xmath52 for these models , adopting the index defined by @xcite , where @xmath53 is rest - frame monochromatic absorbed flux at 5 kev and @xmath54 is 12-micron flux , are @xmath55 for type  1 agn , and @xmath56 for type 2 agn with unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of @xmath57  ergs  s@xmath16 and @xmath58  @xmath1 .",
    "again , both indices are similar to measured values for local agn @xcite . whether these sed models remain valid at high redshift",
    "is an hypothesis that is effectively being tested by the comparison of predicted and observed number counts .",
    "intrinsic agn x - ray spectra can be represented by attenuated power laws of the form : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the number of photons with energy @xmath61 ; @xmath62 is the power - law photon index ; @xmath63 represents the cross section for photoelectric absorption of soft x - rays , given by @xcite assuming solar abundance of metals ; and @xmath20 is the neutral hydrogen column density along the line of sight , ranging from typical high galactic latitude values of @xmath48  @xmath1 to the limit for compton - thick absorption , @xmath64  @xmath1 .",
    "a typical value for the intrinsic slope is @xmath65 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is important to note that a reflection hump can make the spectrum look harder , closer to @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "here we assume @xmath66 ; we have verified that the choice of @xmath62 has only a minor effect in our results .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is normalized relative to the optical using the correlation between intrinsic x - ray luminosity at 2  kev and uv emission at 2500  , @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "this relation has a dispersion of @xmath68 in the exponent and is significant at the 7.9@xmath69 level when balqsos are excluded ( they are in any case rare ) .      from 1000    to @xmath70 m",
    "we use the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) composite quasar spectrum @xcite , which represents an average of over 2000 sdss quasars with a median redshift @xmath71 , covering rest - frame wavelengths from 800     to 8555     at a resolution of @xmath72    .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity of quasars in this sample spans the range from @xmath73  mag to @xmath74  mag .",
    "this spectrum well represents unobscured ( type  1 ) agn , in which the optical light from the central engine is not absorbed by the dust or gas torus .",
    "given that the sdss quasar composite includes agn brighter than the average agn observed in x - rays , the use of the sdss composite spectrum may not be realistic ; however , it is completely appropriate to our very simple model which assumes the obscuring torus is independent of luminosity or redshift",
    ". furthermore , there are good indications that the optical spectrum of faint quasars is very similar to the spectrum of the average sdss quasar @xcite .    to calculate the effects of absorption on the optical and uv spectrum we use the extinction coefficients of @xcite , obtained from absorption measurements on milky way stars . a standard milky way dust - to - gas ratio was assumed to convert neutral hydrogen column density into optical extinction : @xmath75 @xcite",
    "some studies of the dust - to - gas ratio in agn point out that this ratio is on average significantly smaller than the value obtained for the milky way @xcite , but this picture has been questioned @xcite . here",
    "we assume the more conservative position and use the standard dust - to - gas ratio value .",
    "if in fact this ratio is two orders of magnitude lower for agn @xcite , marginally obscured agn ( with @xmath76  @xmath1 ) will be significantly brighter in the optical .",
    "for example , a source with @xmath77  ergs  s@xmath16 and @xmath34  @xmath1 at @xmath78 will be @xmath791 magnitude brighter in the @xmath5-band if the dust - to - gas ratio is two orders of magnitude smaller than in the milky way . for more luminous sources",
    "this effect is larger , reaching @xmath3 5 magnitudes in the @xmath5-band for a source with @xmath80  ergs  s@xmath16 and @xmath34  @xmath1 at @xmath78 .",
    "however , this is about the maximum discrepancy for the sample studied in this paper , since sources with column densities larger than @xmath81  @xmath1 or lower than @xmath82  @xmath1 are not significantly affected in the optical bands since they are already too obscured ( and thus dominated by the host galaxy ) or the obscuration is too low to make a significant change .",
    "also , the infrared bands are not greatly affected by a change in the dust - to - gas ratio assumed .",
    "therefore , our conclusions should not be greatly affected by a different choice of dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "given the small goods volume , the contribution of very high redshift sources ( @xmath83 ) to the total sample is negligible . for",
    "these sources , @xmath5-band observations ( @xmath84    ) effectively correspond to @xmath85   in the rest frame , and therefore absorption from the intergalactic medium @xcite can safely be ignored in the whole sample .    to the agn spectrum",
    "we add optical light from a host galaxy , for which we assume an @xmath35 elliptical with spectrum given by @xcite . in order to account for the evolution of the host galaxy , caused mainly by star formation",
    ", we adopt the evolutionary correction of @xcite , assuming an elliptical galaxy with an e - folding time of the star formation rate of 1 gyr .",
    "this model predicts an increase in the @xmath5-band luminosity of @xmath86 magnitudes at redshift @xmath79 1 .",
    "preliminary results using goods optical data ( simmons et al 2004 , in prep ) show that a large fraction of the agn host galaxies in the survey are luminous elliptical , justifying our assumption .",
    "the host galaxy dominates the optical light for obscured sources with @xmath87  @xmath1 . as an example , for a source with intrinsic hard x - ray luminosity @xmath77  ergs  s@xmath16 and @xmath34  @xmath1 the agn contribution to the total optical light is only @xmath88% at @xmath89 .",
    "optical , uv , and soft x - ray light absorbed by dust within the agn is re - radiated as thermal emission in the far infrared . instead of using observed infrared spectra we use the dust - re - emission models of @xcite in order to construct a grid of infrared spectra as a function of the x - ray luminosity of the agn and observed @xmath20 value ( related to the line - of - sight angle in these physically - motivated models ) .",
    "these models provide a better fit for recent infrared observations , as well as other advantages over older torus models ( e.g. @xcite ) ; for a detailed discussion of this point see @xcite .",
    "the @xcite models postulate a random distribution of clumps inside a dusty torus .",
    "each clump is optically thick , and the radial distribution is confined between an inner radius @xmath90 and an outer radius @xmath91 ( see figure 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the mean free path between clumps is given by a power law of the form @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the radial distance from the central engine , while the angular dependence of the number of clumps is a gaussian distribution with dispersion @xmath69 , so that the number of clouds as a function of viewing angle @xmath94 is given by @xmath95 where @xmath94 is measured with respect to the equatorial plane . in this work",
    "we assume @xmath96 , @xmath97 and an optical depth of each clump of @xmath98 , which gives an optical depth at the equator of @xmath99 ( or @xmath100  @xmath1 assuming the standard dust to gas ratio ) and 0.06 at the poles .",
    "this permits agn ranging from those that are compton thick down to those that are completely unobscured ( although to compare to observations , we assume a minimum column density of @xmath101  @xmath1 for unobscured sources , corresponding to the observed column density through our own galaxy in the direction of the goods - s or goods - n fields ) .",
    "also , we consider three different combinations of values for the parameters @xmath102 and @xmath103 ; namely @xmath104 and @xmath105 , @xmath104 and @xmath106 and @xmath107 and @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "all three combinations of values for the parameters generate ir spectra that are consistent with the observations of some local agn , as can be seen in figure  [ local_seds ] and in @xcite .",
    "this dust emission model gives an ir spectrum for a given intrinsic @xmath20 .",
    "we calculate the @xmath20 distribution expected from a simple obscuring torus model with fixed geometry and dust distribution and we use this model to convert @xmath20 into viewing angle . from this model",
    "we obtain a new @xmath20 function , based on the agn unification paradigm , called model  b in what follows ( in contrast to model  a , which uses the observed @xmath20 distribution ) .",
    "we assume the torus lies at a distance @xmath108 from the central engine and has height @xmath109 , and that its density distribution is given by @xmath110 ( no radial dependence ) . a schematic diagram of this geometry is shown in figure  [ agn_diag ] and the optical depth as a function of viewing angle is @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the optical depth of the torus at the equatorial plane and @xmath113 parameterizes the exponential decay of density with viewing angle .",
    "using a standard dust - to - gas ratio , we can relate optical depth to column density via @xmath114  @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "then for an equatorial column density @xmath115  @xmath1 , a ratio of radius @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and a random distribution of viewing angles , we obtain the model @xmath20 distribution shown in figure  [ nh_dist ] .",
    "this set of parameters was selected in order to obtain a ratio of obscured to unobscured of @xmath3 3 , consistent with the locally observed value @xcite and roughly consistent with population synthesis models that explain the spectrum of the x - ray background .",
    "a larger torus at larger radius could also give a 3:1 ratio and would have a cooler far - infrared spectrum , but until we get the @xmath6 infrared data , we can not constrain the far - infrared emission .",
    "this distribution is very similar to that observed in the goods fields ( solid line in figure  [ nh_dist ] ) , except for @xmath118  @xmath1 sources . for such high column densities , the discrepancy , of the order of 10 - 15% in the fractional distribution ,",
    "is probably caused by incompleteness in the @xmath9 samples , since the amount of obscuration is large enough to hide even the hard x - ray emission .",
    "in particular , for @xmath119  @xmath1 the incompleteness of the @xmath9 observations in the @xmath9 deep fields is @xmath120% , increasing to @xmath121 for @xmath122  @xmath1 , using the u03 luminosity function and calculating the number of sources below the x - ray flux limit as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "overall , for our model , roughly 50% of the agn are not detected in the @xmath9 deep fields ( see   4.3 for details ) .",
    "model b thus comprises the u03 luminosity function ( including its redshift evolution ) , the agn seds described in section  [ sed ] , and the @xmath20 function given by equation [ tau_phi ] .",
    "implicit in this model is that the ratio of obscured to unobscured agn is constant with redshift , and that the geometry of the torus does not change with redshift or luminosity .    for a given luminosity , spectra for different orientation angles",
    "are normalized at @xmath123  @xmath8 m , where the optical depth is low and thus the re - processed emission from the torus is roughly isotropic .",
    "the infrared spectrum is then joined smoothly to the optical spectrum at 1  @xmath8 m so that the resulting spectrum is continuous . infrared emission from star formation",
    "is not considered in this model .",
    "we compare the number counts calculated above to the optical and x - ray flux distributions for agn in the two goods fields , based on @xmath9 and hst acs multi - band data .",
    "the two goods fields , each @xmath124 , were imaged with acs in the @xmath125,@xmath126,@xmath127 and @xmath5 bands , for a total of 13 orbits per pointing , reaching ab magnitude 27.4 ( 5@xmath69 ) in the @xmath5 band .",
    "the goods fields have also been imaged extensively from the ground in ubvrizjhk , and spectroscopy is ongoing .",
    "details of these observations can be found in @xcite and at http://www.stsci.edu/science/goods .",

    "the goods fields will be observed with the @xmath6 irac instrument in all four bands ( 3.6 to 8 @xmath8 m ) , with expected sensitivity of 0.6@xmath8jy in the 3.6@xmath8 m band .",

    "the predicted @xmath20 distributions for the sources in the goods n+s fields in models a and b are compared in figure  [ nh_dist ] .",
    "model b provides a better fit to the observed data ; a k - s test on both models compared to the observations revealed that the null hypothesis ( that the model and observed distributions are drawn from the same parent distribution ) is acceptable at the 75.3% confidence level for model  b and at the 58.5% confidence level for model  a. this is not surprising since model  b uses an @xmath20 function with parameters chosen to be consistent with the observations ; however , it is important to note that this model is motivated by the unification paradigm , which clearly can account for the observed @xmath20 distribution .",
    "the total area covered as a function of x - ray flux limit for each goods field was calculated based on the results presented in a03 and is shown in figure  [ area ] .",
    "these curves are needed to normalize the hard x - ray flux distributions for sources in the goods fields , shown in figure  [ xray_dist ] .",

    "although the u03 sample includes the cdf - n , this is not a circular argument since in that work only the brightest cdf - n sources ( with @xmath150  ergs  @xmath1  s@xmath16 in the hard band ) were considered , and therefore our calculation tests the extrapolation to much fainter fluxes . in the hard x - ray flux distribution",
    "both unobscured ( type  1 ) and obscured ( type  2 ) agn are well represented ( dotted and dashed lines in figure [ xray_dist ] ) .      in deep optical imaging with the hst acs camera the vast majority of the x - ray sources in the goods fields",

    "unobscured agn ( dashed line ) fail to account for the faintest optical counterparts .",
    "given their large x - ray to optical flux ratios , the fainter optical sources ( @xmath153 mag ) may be obscured agn at redshifts @xmath154 @xcite .",
    "indeed in our models most obscured agn ( dotted line ) have faint optical magnitudes , while the unobscured agn are responsible for the peak at brighter magnitudes .",
    "for @xmath153 mag , the approximate limit for ground - based spectroscopy , obscured agn are the dominant population .",

    ", our goods - s sample of hard x - ray sources is 100% complete .",
    "however , in the goods - n field , combining spectroscopic and photometric redshifts @xcite , the sample is only @xmath135% complete .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts are shown by the hatched regions . at redshifts above @xmath155",
    ", there is a clear discrepancy between the spectroscopic redshifts and either the photometric redshift or the model predictions , in the sense that there are fewer agn with high spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "this is explained at least in part by the effective brightness limit for spectroscopy , @xmath156 mag , for even the largest ground - based telescopes . imposing this optical limit on the goods agn model (",
    "long dashed line in figure  [ red_dist ] ) does match the observed spectroscopic redshift distribution very well .",
    "obscured agn at @xmath138 , in particular , are fainter than this limit and thus are not included in the spectroscopic samples .",
    "this likely accounts for the discrepancy between the observed redshift distribution of x - ray sources @xcite and the distribution predicted from population synthesis models for the x - ray background @xcite , as well as the low number of type  2 agn identifications .",
    "the agreement between the model and the observations is good , with a k - s test giving 63% confidence for the null hypothesis in the goods - s field and 21% confidence in the goods",
    "- n field .",
    "this slightly lower level arises because the model predicts still more high redshift agn than are observed in the goods fields .",
    "this is because some high - redshift obscured agn are too faint even for the hst images ( see @xcite ) and because the most obscured agn are not detected in the @xmath9 deep fields .",
    "also , an excess of observed sources at @xmath157 can be seen .",
    "this is explained by the presence of clusters and large scale structure in both fields ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ red_dist ] shows the difference between the north and south fields , in the sense that there is a larger discrepancy between the photometric redshifts and the model in the north .",
    "this must be due to incompleteness since again the missing 25% of the agn ( those without photometric or spectroscopic redshifts ) are preferentially fainter .",
    "the model redshift distribution is therefore in agreement with the data once these selection effects are considered .",
    "it is also compatible with the kind of distribution predicted from population synthesis @xcite , in the sense that it peaks at a higher redshift than previously reported distributions , with the same caveat about selection effects .",
    "this better agreement between models and observations is explained also in part by the use of the u03 luminosity function , that includes a redshift distribution that peaks at lower redshifts than existing optical quasar luminosity functions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hard x - ray surveys find obscured sources that are largely missed in deep optical / uv surveys . deriving a hard x - ray luminosity function or",
    "a redshift distribution imposes an effective optical cut at @xmath158 mag , since optical spectroscopy is required to obtain redshifts .",
    "thus published redshift distributions can be missing optically faint sources .",
    "these sources can be either low - luminosity unobscured agn or obscured agn , depending on their central engine luminosity , and in general , the spectroscopic incompleteness increases with redshift .",
    "this selection effect explains the discrepancy between the photometric and spectroscopic redshift distributions ( fig .",
    "[ red_dist ] ) .",
    "evidence for the existence of a significant number of obscured agn at @xmath138 was previously given by @xcite , who found a correlation between x - ray luminosity and x - ray - to - optical flux ratio in obscured agn .",
    "such a correlation can be explained by our models since for obscured agn the optical light is dominated by the host galaxy , which is independent of the agn luminosity .",
    "therefore , for an obscured agn the optical emission is roughly constant , while the x - ray emission scales directly with the agn luminosity . using this correlation , @xcite estimated source redshifts using just the x - ray - to - optical flux ratio , thus including sources too faint for optical spectroscopy .",
    "they concluded there is a significant number of obscured agn at @xmath138 , and that these sources will be missed by surveys that rely on optical spectroscopy .",
    "we arrive at the same conclusion from a different direction , based on the comparison of our model with multiwavelength observations of x - ray sources .",
    "the goods hst data reveal an appreciable number of optically faint , x - ray - selected agn .",
    "while unobscured sources are bright in the optical bands , the vast majority of them brighter than the spectroscopic limit , obscured sources will be optically fainter and therefore missed preferentially by surveys that depend on spectroscopic identifications .",
    "most obscured agn are bright enough in hard x - rays to be detected in the @xmath9 observations . therefore , given the large x - ray - to - optical flux ratios of the optically faint sample , their hardness ratio and their red colors , they are very likely to be obscured agn at @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "sources with high x - ray - to - optical flux ratio in other fields were discussed previously in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and in most cases these sources can be identified as obscured agn at high redshift .",
    "both models for the @xmath20 distribution fit the observed flux distributions well ( figs  [ xray_dist],[z_dist ] ) .",
    "model  a assumed the empirical @xmath20 function described in u03 , which is based on observations from several x - ray surveys and did not go as deep as the goods sample , while model  b uses an @xmath20 function based on a simple unified model , with the idea of a dust torus covering the central engine .",
    "it is important to note that model  b predicts a larger number of sources with @xmath159  @xmath1 than is observed , commensurate with the large number of very obscured sources needed to explain the x - ray background spectrum ( @xcite , u03 ) .",
    "the _ observed _ ratio of obscured to unobscured sources in the goods fields is @xmath792.5 when the division point is set at @xmath160  @xmath1 as assumed by @xcite , less than the intrinsic value of 4 required by the x - ray background models .",
    "that is , the observed ratio is affected by incompleteness in the x - ray samples at high column densities .",
    "based on the u03 luminosity function and our torus model to calculate the @xmath20 distribution we calculate that the completeness level of the @xmath9 observations in the goods fields drops to @xmath135% for @xmath161  @xmath1 and @xmath162% for @xmath163  @xmath1 .",
    "this is caused by absorption of the x - ray emission which makes harder to detect sources with higher column densities in a flux - limited survey .",
    "therefore , if there are heavily obscured agn in the field , the intrinsic ratio of obscured to unobscured sources is larger than the observed ratio , and can even be @xmath88 , as suggested by population synthesis models for the x - ray background .",
    "the relation between the observed x - ray sources in the goods fields and the models for the x - ray background will be analyzed in more detail in a later paper ( treister et al .",
    "2004 , in prep . ) .",
    "we can ask whether the x - ray absorption correlates with the optical dimming ; that is , is obscuration making bright hard x - ray sources optically faint ?",
    "the relation between optical magnitude and amount of obscuration is shown in figure  [ nh_i ] .",
    "sources that present large amounts of obscuration in the x - ray spectrum are in general the fainter sources in the optical , as expected .",
    "there is no strong correlation present in figure  [ nh_i ]  both obscured and unobscured agn appear at bright magnitudes  but the highest column densities do correspond to the faintest magnitudes . in particular , it is important to note that there are no unobscured sources at magnitudes @xmath164 , which is consistent with our model predictions of a very low number of unobscured agn at faint magnitudes . there is no strong correlation because the optical emission from obscured agn is dominated by the host galaxy ; once the optical emission of the agn is absorbed , the @xmath127-band magnitude becomes insensitive to the amount of obscuration or to the intrinsic luminosity of the agn .",
    "the full x - ray ( 0.5 - 8 kev ) to optical ( @xmath5-band ) flux ratio , where @xmath165 is the x - ray flux in units of ergs  @xmath1  s@xmath16 and @xmath166 is the optical magnitude in the @xmath5 band in the ab system . ] for goods agn is shown in figure  [ fx_opt ] , together with the ratio obtained from our model .",
    "the agreement between these two distributions is very good , with a k - s confidence level of @xmath167% for the null hypothesis , except for a small discrepancy at @xmath168 , which is consistent with the previously calculated incompleteness of the x - ray samples for @xmath118  @xmath1 .",
    "a second discrepancy appears at the low @xmath169 end , which can be explained by the presence of a few starburst galaxy and other non - agn x - ray sources in the @xmath9 deep fields observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these sources , around 10% of the total sample , are not accounted in our model and therefore increase the number of observed x - ray sources with @xmath170 .",
    "this number of non - agn x - ray sources is in agreement with the values reported by a03 .",
    "the @xmath6 space telescope was launched in august 2003 and the goods fields are scheduled to be observed in 2004 .",
    "agn are luminous infrared sources @xcite , so the ratio of obscured to unobscured agn will be strongly constrained by the observed @xmath6 number counts of x - ray sources .",
    "these two classes can be separated using a combination of irac 4.5 and 8 microns bands and mips 24 microns data @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the infrared spectrum is sensitive to parameters of the dust emission model , so will help refine the present simple spectral models .",
    "the agn number counts at 24  @xmath8 m calculated according to   [ scheme ] assuming the appropriate hard x - ray flux limit for each @xmath9 deep field separately , and normalized to the total goods area ( @xmath171  deg@xmath133 ) , are shown in figure  [ 24_dist ] ; the number counts at 8  @xmath8 m and 3.6  @xmath8 m are presented in figures  [ 8_dist ] and [ 3_dist ] .",
    "contributions from obscured and unobscured agn were calculated from hard x - ray luminosity functions using model  b. for the infrared part of the sed , we assumed three different sets of parameters , as is described in  [ sed ] ; each shaded region for the total and obscured number of sources corresponds to the extremes that these values can have . for unobscured sources ,",
    "the shape of the infrared sed is almost independent of the assumed parameters , so only one line is plotted .",
    "one important conclusion from this calculation is that all the agn detected in the @xmath9 deep fields should be detected in the @xmath6 observations .",
    "the contrary is not the case since some obscured agn are missed by x - ray observations .",
    "this difference is shown by the top two curves in figure  [ 24_dist ] .",
    "indeed , obscured agn with @xmath118  @xmath1 should all be detected with @xmath6 , in principle allowing for a complete study of the agn population in this field and providing a test for both the unified model of agn and the population synthesis models used to explain the x - ray background .",
    "however , to identify obscured agn not detected in x - rays and to separate them from luminous starburst galaxies will not be easy .",
    "in fact , @xcite reported that is not possible to separate very obscured agn activity from a burst of star formation just on the basis of infrared photometry , even if information in the mips 70-micron band is included .",
    "this problem is even more serious since typically there is overlap between the two populations , and a starbust galaxy can harbor a very obscured agn . in order to solve this problem , we can take advantage of goods multiwavelength coverage , ranging from 0.4 to 24 microns , which allows us to calculate accurate photometric redshifts and bolometric luminosities for even very faint sources .",
    "then , to first order , we can use bolometric luminosity in order to separate agn activity from starburst galaxies , since all agn should have @xmath172  ergs  s@xmath16 , while starbursts typically have much lower luminosities .",
    "similar calculations of the agn number counts in the infrared were performed recently by @xcite . for @xmath173 and @xmath17 , they found a total of @xmath174 sources per square degree with a 24 @xmath8 m flux higher than 550 @xmath8jy , @xmath175% of them seyfert 2s .",
    "we predict a much lower number of sources , @xmath176 sources per square degree at the same flux limit in the 24  @xmath8 m band , with @xmath177% of them being seyfert  2s .",
    "this large discrepancy of 2 orders of magnitude can be explained by the difference in the assumed luminosity function and evolution .",
    "we used a hard x - ray luminosity function and luminosity - dependent density evolution , which peaks at redshifts @xmath30 for qso - like objects and @xmath178 for low - luminosity agn , whereas @xcite used a local luminosity function based on 12-@xmath8 m observations and optical qso evolution with a peak at @xmath179 and exponential decay until @xmath180 .",
    "locally both luminosity functions are very similar so the major part of the discrepancy is explained by the difference in the assumed evolution .",
    "this shows clearly that @xmath6 observations will provide a significant constraint on the agn number density evolution .",
    "in this work we modeled the agn population of the goods fields in order to explain the observed numbers and brightnesses at optical and x - ray energies .",
    "we also predicted the number counts at infrared wavelengths that will be measured with the @xmath6 space telescope .",
    "basic ingredients of our models are few .",
    "first , we used the hard x - ray luminosity function and luminosity - dependent evolution determined by u03 .",
    "second , we developed a library of multi - wavelength agn seds parameterized as a function of only two parameters , the intrinsic rest - frame hard x - ray luminosity and the amount of gas and dust in the line of sight , given as a neutral hydrogen column density .",
    "these composite seds assume an intrinsic power law plus photoelectric absorption in x - rays ; a qso composite spectrum in the optical , independent of both redshift and luminosity ; milky way - type extinction ; an @xmath35 elliptical host galaxy evolving with redshift ; and infrared dust re - emission models from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , we needed to assume the relative number of sources at each value of @xmath20 . in model",
    "a , we used the @xmath20 function given in u03 , which is based on observations of x - ray sources in several surveys . for model  b",
    ", we used a simple geometric model for a dust torus to generate the expected distribution of @xmath20 for random orientation angles .",
    "the torus parameters were chosen so that the ratio of obscured ( @xmath87  @xmath1 ) to unobscured agn is 3:1 , and we assumed it was independent of redshift and luminosity . with these ingredients , we calculated the expected distribution of sources at different wavebands and compared them to the goods observations .",
    "we found general agreement between the models and observations , especially for the very simple unified model .",
    "this means there may well be a significant population of obscured agn at high redshift , consistent with a roughly constant ratio of obscured to unobscured agn out to high redshift , @xmath2 .",
    "these objects will be bright enough to detect with the planned @xmath6 observations in the goods field .",
    "the agreement between model and observations is remarkable given the very simple assumptions used in the calculation",
    ". because the goods observations are so deep , there are large extrapolations from existing luminosity functions .",
    "the excellent agreement supports the unified model of agn .",
    "a large population of obscured agn in the early universe explains not only the goods data but the x - ray background spectral shape and intensity .",
    "however , for this picture to be correct , existing x - ray samples , even from the extremely deep @xmath9 fields , must be incomplete .",
    "we find that the luminosity - function - weighted fraction of obscured agn that is missed at current detection limits is approximately equal to the excess predicted by our unified model at faint optical magnitudes and high absorbing column densities .",
