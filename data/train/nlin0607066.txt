    "during the last two decades the so - called `` rapid change model '' of a passively advected scalar by a self - similar gaussian @xmath8correlated in time velocity field introduced by kraichnan @xcite and number of its extensions have played the central role in the theoretical investigation of intermittency and anomalous scaling , the problems which stay in the center of attention in the framework of the inertial range investigation of fully developed turbulence @xcite , i.e. , in the range characterized by the scales which are far away from the largest scales at which energy is pumping into the system and , at the same time , far away form the smallest scales which are related to the dissipation processes .",
    "there are at least three reasons for this interest : first of all , it is well - known from experimental and also theoretical studies that the deviations from the statements of the famous classical kolmogorov - obukhov phenomenological theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) is surprisingly more noticeable and visible for the simpler models of passively advected scalar quantity ( scalar field ) than for the velocity field itself ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; second , at the same time , the problem of passive advection of scalar field ( as well as vector field ) is much easier from theoretical point of view than the original problem of anomalous scaling in the framework of navier - stokes velocity field , and , in the end , third , even very simplified models with given gaussian statistics of velocity field lead to the anomalous behavior which describe many features of the real turbulent advection , see , e.g. , refs.@xcite and references cited therein . as was already mentioned , the crucial role in these studies was played ( and is still played ) by the aforementioned rapid change model of a passive scalar advection , where , for the first time , the systematic analysis of the corresponding anomalous exponents was done on the microscopic level .",
    "for example , within the so - called `` zero - mode approach '' to the rapid change model @xcite ( see also survey paper @xcite ) the anomalous exponents are found from the homogenous solutions ( zero modes ) of the closed equations for the single - time correlations .",
    "on the other hand , one of the most effective approach for studying self - similar scaling behavior is the method of the field theoretic renormalization group ( rg ) @xcite",
    ". it can be also used in the theory of fully developed turbulence @xcite and related problems , e.g. , in the problem of a passive scalar advection by the turbulent environment @xcite ( see also refs.@xcite for details ) .",
    "in refs.@xcite the field theoretic rg and operator - product expansion ( ope ) were used in the systematic investigation of the rapid - change model of a passive scalar .",
    "it was shown that within the field theoretic approach the anomalous scaling is related to the very existence of so - called `` dangerous '' composite operators with negative critical dimensions in ope ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite for details ) .",
    "in the subsequent papers @xcite the anomalous exponents of the model were calculated within the @xmath1 expansion up to order @xmath9 ( three - loop approximation ) . here",
    "@xmath1 is a parameter which describes a given equal - time pair correlation function of the velocity field ( see next section ) .",
    "important advantages of the rg approach are its universality and calculational efficiency : a regular systematic perturbation expansion for the anomalous exponents was constructed , similar to the well - known @xmath10-expansion in the theory of phase transitions .",
    "besides various generalizations of the kraichnan model towards more realistic ones , namely , models with inclusion of small scale anisotropy @xcite , compressibility @xcite , and finite correlation time of the velocity field @xcite were studied by the field theoretic approach .",
    "general conclusion of all these investigations is that the anomalous scaling , which is the most intriguing and important feature of the kraichnan rapid change model , remains valid for all generalized models .    in ref.@xcite the field theoretic rg and ope were applied to the rapid change model of passive scalar advected by gaussian strongly anisotropic velocity field where the anomalous exponents of the structure functions were calculated to the first order in @xmath1 expansion .",
    "it was shown that in the presence of small - scale anisotropy the corresponding exponents are nonuniversal , i.e. , they are functions of the anisotropy parameters , and they form the hierarchy with the leading exponent related to the most `` isotropic '' operator .",
    "the importance of these investigations is related to the question of the influence of anisotropy on inertial - range behavior of passively advected fields as well as the velocity field itself @xcite ( see also the survey paper @xcite and references cited therein , as well as recent astrophysical investigations , e.g , in refs.@xcite ) .",
    "on one hand , it was shown that for the even structure ( or correlation ) functions the exponents which describe the inertial - range scaling exhibit universality and they are ordered hierarchically in respect to degree of anisotropy with leading contribution given by the exponent from the isotropic shell but , on the other hand , the survival of the anisotropy in the inertial - range is demonstrated by the behavior of the odd structure functions , namely , the so - called skewness factor decreases down the scales slower than expected earlier in accordance with the classical kolmogorov - obukhov theory .",
    "on the other hand , in ref.@xcite the influence of compressibility and large - scale anisotropy on the anomalous scaling behavior was studied in the aforementioned model in the order @xmath11 in the @xmath1 expansion , and anomalous exponents of higher - order correlation functions were calculated as functions of the parameter of compressibility .",
    "it was shown that the exponents exhibit hierarchy related to the degree of anisotropy .",
    "again , the existence of small - scale anisotropy effects were demonstrated by the odd dimensionless ratios of correlation functions : the skewness and hyperskewness factors , and it was shown that the persistent of small - scale anisotropy is more pronounced for larger values of the compressibility parameter @xmath12 . from this point of view , compressible systems are very interesting to be studied .    in present paper , we shall continue in the investigation of the model , namely , for the first time , we shall study the model with compressible velocity field together with assumption about its small - scale uniaxial anisotropy in the first order in @xmath1 , i.e. , we shall extend the model studied in ref.@xcite to the compressible case . in this situation , in general ,",
    "two types of diffusion - advection problems of scalar particles exist in the compressible case which are identical in the incompressible case . in what follows , we shall study only one of them , namely , the advection of so - called `` tracer '' ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , i.e. , for example , concentration of a scalar impurity , temperature , entropy , etc .",
    "details will be shown in the next section .",
    "first of all we shall establish stability of the scaling regime of the model and coordinates of the corresponding infrared ( ir ) stable fixed point will be found analytically as functions of the compressibility and anisotropy parameters .",
    "these results will be then used in the analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the single - time structure functions of a passively advected scalar field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.[sec : model ] we present definition of the model and introduce the compressibility and small - scale uniaxial anisotropy to the given pair correlation function of the velocity field .",
    "in sec.[sec : field ] we give the field theoretic formulation of the original stochastic problem and discuss the corresponding diagrammatic technique .",
    "the analysis of the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences of the model is given , the multiplicative renormalizability of the model is established , and the renormalization constants are calculated in one - loop approximation . in sec.[sec : scalreg ] we analyze infrared ( ir ) asymptotic behavior of the model which is governed by the ir stable fixed point .",
    "explicit expressions for the coordinates of the ir fixed point are found . in sec.[sec6 ] the renormalization of needed composite operators is done and their critical dimensions are found as functions of parameters of the model . in sec.[sec : conc ] discussion of results is present .",
    "we shall consider the problem of the advection of a passive `` tracer '' @xmath13 which is described by the following stochastic equation @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the laplace operator , @xmath18 is the coefficient of molecular diffusivity ( hereafter all parameters with a subscript @xmath19 denote bare parameters of unrenormalized theory ; see below ) , @xmath20 is the @xmath21-th component of the compressible velocity field @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is a gaussian random noise with zero mean and correlation function @xmath24 where parentheses @xmath25 hereafter denote average over corresponding statistical ensemble .",
    "the noise defined in eq.([correlator ] ) maintains the steady - state of the system but the concrete form of the correlator will not be essential in what follows .",
    "the only condition which must be fulfilled by the function @xmath26 is that it must decrease rapidly for @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes an integral scale related to the stirring .",
    "as was already mentioned in introduction , another type of the diffusion - advection problem exists in the case when compressibility of the velocity field is supposed which is given by the following more general stochastic equation @xcite @xmath29 it describes the passive advection of a density field but , in what follows , we shall not study this problem . in the case of incompressible velocity field",
    "( it is given mathematically by the divergence - free condition @xmath30 ) both models are equivalent .",
    "in real problems it is traditionally assumed that the velocity field @xmath22 satisfies stochastic navier - stokes equation @xcite . in spite of , in what follows",
    ", we shall suppose that the velocity field obeys a gaussian distribution with zero mean and two - point correlator @xmath31 , \\label{corv}\\ ] ] i.e , we shall work in the framework of the so - called rapid - change model @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath32 denotes the dimension of the @xmath33 space , and @xmath34 is an amplitude factor related to the coupling constant @xmath35 of the model ( expansion parameter in the perturbation theory , see next section ) by the relation @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the characteristic uv momentum scale .",
    "the parameter of the energy spectrum of the velocity field @xmath38 is taken in such a way that its `` kolmogorov '' value ( the value which corresponds to the kolmogorov scaling of the velocity correlation function in developed turbulence ) is @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is another integral scale .",
    "in general , the scale @xmath40 may be different from the integral scale @xmath28 introduced in eq.([correlator ] ) but , in accordance with ref.@xcite , we suppose that @xmath41 .    in the incompressible isotropic case",
    "the second - rank tensor @xmath42 in eq.([corv ] ) has the simple form of the ordinary transverse projector @xmath43 , where @xmath44 .",
    "this tensor is changed when one incorporates small - scale anisotropy or compressibility .",
    "let us briefly discuss these questions .",
    "first of all , in the case of incompressible anisotropic case a new second - rank tensor must be again a transverse operator because the velocity field is still divergence - free ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the simplest way how to introduce small - scale uniaxial anisotropy is to take the operator @xmath42 in the following way @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the usual transverse projection operator ( as defined above ) , the unit vector @xmath47 determines the distinguished direction , and @xmath48 , @xmath49 are parameters characterizing the anisotropy .",
    "the positive definiteness of the correlation function ( [ corv ] ) imposes the following restrictions on their values : @xmath50 .",
    "the operator ( [ t - ij ] ) is a special case of the general transverse structure that possesses uniaxial anisotropy : @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the angle between the vectors @xmath47 and @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) . using gegenbauer polynomials @xcite the scalar functions in representation ( [ generalt ] )",
    "may be expressed in the form @xmath55 it was shown in ref.@xcite that all main features of the general model with the anisotropy structure represented by eq.([generalt ] ) are included in the simplified model with the special form of the transverse operator given by eq.([t - ij ] ) .",
    "second , in the case of the compressible isotropic velocity field the second - rank tensor @xmath42 in eq.([corv ] ) is not longer a transverse projector but it is rather a combination of the transverse projector @xmath56 and of the longitudinal projector @xmath57 as a result of the fact that the velocity field is not longer solenoidal one .",
    "thus , in this case , the correlator ( [ corv ] ) contains the tensor structure of the following general form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a free parameter of the compressibility .",
    "the value @xmath60 corresponds to the divergence - free ( incompressible ) advecting velocity field .",
    "it was used in refs.@xcite for determination of the influence of the compressibility on the anomalous scaling of the correlation functions of scalar density , as well as tracer fields in two - loop level .    in what follows",
    ", we shall study the combined effects given by the small - scale anisotropy and compressibility and our aim will be to study possible deviations from the conclusions given in ref.@xcite , where the rapid - change model of passively advected scalar field with small scale uniaxial anisotropy was studied . to do this , it is necessary to introduce into the velocity field correlator ( [ corv ] ) corresponding second - rank tensor which will have needed properties . the simplest way how to do",
    "this is to add longitudinal projector @xmath61 to the uniaxial anisotropic transverse tensor structure given in eq.([t - ij ] ) .",
    "thus , the result tensor structure which will be used in our investigations is defined as @xmath62 it means that we have introduced the compressible term to the isotropic component of the axially anisotropic tensor structure ( [ t - ij ] ) only .",
    "therefore , the contributions of compressibility and anisotropy are given by a simple sum of the corresponding terms .",
    "nevertheless , as we shall see , the combined effects of anisotropy and compressibility on the results will not be a simple sum of them .",
    "according to the well - known general theorem ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) the stochastic problem ( [ stoch1 ] ) and ( [ correlator ] ) is equivalent to the field - theoretic model of the set of three fields @xmath63 with the following action functional @xmath64^{-1 } v_j(t_2,{\\bf x_2 } ) \\nonumber   \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2 } \\int dt_1\\,d^d{\\bf x_1}\\,dt_2\\,d^d{\\bf x_2 } \\ , \\theta^{\\prime}(t_1,{\\bf x_1 } ) d^f(t_1,{\\bf x_1};t_2,{\\bf x_2 } ) \\theta^{\\prime}(t_2,{\\bf x_2 } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\int dt\\,d^d{\\bf x}\\,\\ , \\theta^{\\prime}\\left[-\\partial_t - v_i\\partial_i+\\nu_0\\triangle \\right]\\theta , \\label{action1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is an auxiliary field , and all summations over the vector indices are implied . the second and the third integral in eq.([action1 ] )",
    "correspond to the martin - siggia - rose action @xcite for the stochastic problem ( [ stoch1 ] ) , ( [ correlator ] ) at fixed velocity field @xmath66 , and the first integral describes the gaussian averaging over @xmath67 defined by the correlator @xmath68 in eq.([corv ] ) with tensor @xmath69 given in eq.([tg - ij ] ) .",
    "action ( [ action1 ] ) is given in a form convenient for application of the field theoretic perturbation analysis with the standard feynman diagrammatic technique .",
    "from the quadratic part of the action one obtains the matrix of bare propagators . the wave - number - frequency representation of propagators of the fields @xmath70 and @xmath65 is @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the fourier transform of the function @xmath73 form eq.([correlator ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the bare propagator of the velocity field @xmath74 is defined by eq.([corv ] ) with the tensor structure given by eq.([tg - ij ] ) . in what follows",
    ", we shall need only the propagators @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "their graphical representation is shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the interaction in the model is given by the nonlinear term @xmath77 with the vertex factor which in the wave - number - frequency representation has the form ( the momentum flows into the vertex via the scalar field @xmath70 ) : @xmath78 its graphical representation is given in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "epsf    = 6.0 cm    = 6.0 cm    standard power counting @xcite leads to the identification of correlation functions with superficial uv divergences . in the framework of the rapid - change passive advection models",
    "detail analysis of this question was done , e.g. , in ref.@xcite , where it was shown that the only one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) green function which possesses superficial uv - divergences is the function @xmath79 ( within the rapid - change model the situation is unchanged when compressibility of the system is assumed ) and , in the isotropic case , this green function leads only to the renormalization of the term @xmath80 of action ( [ action1 ] ) and the corresponding uv divergences may be fully absorbed in the adequate redefinition of the existing parameters @xmath35 , @xmath18 .",
    "thus , all correlation functions calculated in terms of the renormalized parameters @xmath81 are uv finite .",
    "the situation becomes , however , more complicated when anisotropy is introduced .",
    "it is related to the fact that in this case the 1pi green function @xmath82 contains divergences corresponding to the structure @xmath83 ( the only possible anisotropic structure @xmath84 ) which is not present in original unrenormalized action ( [ action1 ] ) .",
    "it leads to the non - renormalizability of the model in the anisotropic case . to make the model",
    "multiplicatively renormalizable it is necessary to extend original action ( [ action1 ] ) by including needed term with corresponding new parameter . as a result",
    "the extended model is described by the following action @xmath64^{-1 } v_j(t_2,{\\bf x_2 } ) \\nonumber   \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2 } \\int dt_1\\,d^d{\\bf x_1}\\,dt_2\\,d^d{\\bf x_2 } \\",

    "this modification leads , of course , also to the modification of the corresponding isotropic propagators of the fields @xmath88 given in eqs.([thetathetap ] ) and ( [ thetatheta ] ) which are now defined as ( see also ref.@xcite ) @xmath89    after this modifications the model defined by action ( [ action2 ] ) becomes multiplicatively renormalizable and the standard rg analysis can be now applied .",
    "the corresponding renormalized action has the form @xmath90^{-1 } v_j(t_2,{\\bf x_2 } ) \\nonumber   \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2 } \\int dt_1\\,d^d{\\bf x_1}\\,dt_2\\,d^d{\\bf x_2 } \\",

    "it is equivalent to the multiplicative renormalization of the bare parameters @xmath93 , and @xmath85 , namely @xmath94 where @xmath81 , and @xmath95 are renormalized counterparts of the corresponding bare parameters , and @xmath96 is a scale setting parameter or the reference mass ( it has the same canonical dimension as the wave number ) . in what follows",
    ", we shall work in minimal subtraction scheme ( ms ) , therefore , in one - loop approximation , the renormalization constants @xmath97 have the form @xmath98 .",
    "thus , @xmath99 is a function of dimensionless parameters but it is independent of @xmath1 .    by comparison of the corresponding terms in action ( [ action3 ] ) with definitions of the renormalization constants @xmath97 for parameters ( [ zetka ] ) , one obtains the following relations between renormalization constants : @xmath100 where last relation in eq.([zetka1 ] ) is a consequence of the fact that @xmath34 defined in eq.([corv ] ) is not renormalized , i.e. , @xmath101 .",
    "standardly , the formulation through the action functional ( [ action1 ] ) ( or through ( [ action3 ] ) in the anisotropic case ) replaces the statistical averages of random quantities in the stochastic problem defined by eqs.([stoch1 ] ) and ( [ correlator ] ) with equivalent functional averages with weight @xmath102 . generating functionals of total green functions",

    "the relation @xmath109 , where @xmath110 stands for the complete set of bare parameters and @xmath111 stands for renormalized one , leads to the relation @xmath112 for the generating functional of connected green functions . by application of the operator @xmath113 at fixed @xmath110 on both sides of the latest equation one obtains the basic rg differential equation @xmath114 where @xmath115 represents operation @xmath116 written in the renormalized variables .",
    "its explicit form is @xmath117 where we denote @xmath118 for any variable @xmath119 and the rg functions ( the @xmath120 and @xmath121 functions ) are given by well - known definitions ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) and , in our case , by using relations ( [ zetka1 ] ) for renormalization constants , they have the following form @xmath122    the renormalization constants @xmath123 are determined by the requirement that the one - particle irreducible green function @xmath124 must be uv finite when is written in renormalized variables . in our case",
    "it means that they have no singularities in the limit @xmath125 .",
    "the one - particle irreducible green function @xmath126 is related to the self - energy operator @xmath127 by the dyson equation @xmath128 thus @xmath123 are found from the requirement that the uv divergences are canceled in eq.([dyson ] ) after substitutions @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",

    "their presence in the ope determines the ir behavior of the scaling functions and leads to their singular dependence on @xmath28 when @xmath231 .",
    "therefore , the turbulence models are crucially different from the models of critical phenomena , where the leading contribution to the representation ( [ ff1 ] ) is given by the simplest operator @xmath232 with the dimension @xmath233 , and the other operators determine only the corrections that vanish for @xmath231 .    epsf    = 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm",

    "these divergences must be removed by special kind of renormalization procedure which can be found , e.g. , in refs.@xcite , where their renormalization is studied in general .",

    "this fact allows us to assign uniquely the concrete critical dimension to the corresponding composite operator even in the case with small - scale anisotropy and study their hierarchical structure as a functions of @xmath237 ( see @xcite for details ) .",

    "it can be immediately seen that only real eigenvalues of the corresponding matrix exist as in the incompressible case studied in ref.@xcite . at the same time , the hierarchical structure of the critical dimensions for different values of @xmath237 and the same @xmath255 shown in ref.@xcite is also preserved .",

    "all the figures show that compressibility leads to smaller values of the critical dimensions of the corresponding composite operators , thus , at the same time , to the more noticeable anomalous scaling .",
    "as it is shown in the figures , the effects of compressibility are the most pronounced for small values of the anisotropy parameters , as well as for the negative values of these parameters . on the other hand , in the limit of large positive values of anisotropy parameters @xmath296 and @xmath297 the effects of compressibility tend to zero .",
    "especially , in the limit @xmath299 the influence of compressibility is vanished completely which can be shown by direct analytical investigation .",

    "it is shown that the leading - order powerlike asymptotic behavior of the single - time structure functions of a scalar field within the inertial range in our compressible anisotropic case is given by the critical dimensions of the same composite operators as in the incompressible anisotropic case but now they acquire rather strong dependence on the compressibility parameter .",
    "further , it is shown that when the parameter of compressibility is increasing then the critical dimensions of relevant composite operators become smaller , therefore , within our model , we can conclude that the anomalous scaling of the structure functions of a passive scalar quantity advected by a given velocity field is more pronounced in the compressible stochastic environment than in the incompressible one ( see figs.[fig56]-[fig2728 ] ) .",

    "thus , all calculated corrections have had purely powerlike behavior .",
    "it is also shown that the critical dimensions are ordered hierarchically as in the incompressible case @xcite , i.e. , the compressibility does not disturb the anisotropic structure of the critical dimensions rather it shifts them toward smaller values .",
    "the largest shift of the critical dimensions is present for negative and small positive values of the anisotropy parameters . on the other hand ,",

    "<S> model of a passive scalar field advected by the compressible gaussian strongly anisotropic velocity field with the covariance @xmath0 is studied by using the field theoretic renormalization group and the operator product expansion . </S>",
    "<S> the inertial - range stability of the corresponding scaling regime is established . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous scaling of the single - time structure functions is studied and the corresponding anomalous exponents are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> their dependence on the compressibility parameter and anisotropy parameters is analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that , as in the isotropic case , the presence of compressibility leads to the decreasing of the critical dimensions of the important composite operators , i.e. , the anomalous scaling is more pronounced in the compressible systems . </S>",
