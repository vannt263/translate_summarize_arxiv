    "nano- and micro - mechanical vibrational systems have been attracting much attention in recent years .",
    "vibrational modes in such systems are not only interesting on their own , but also provide a platform for studying physics far from thermal equilibrium and quantum physics at the macroscale @xcite .",
    "the typical spatial scale of the low - lying modes is the size of the system , and their frequencies are @xmath1  hz .",
    "they have enabled record high force resolution @xcite and mass sensitivity @xcite and have found applications in modern electronic devices such as accelerometers and gyroscopes .",
    "one of the most important characteristics of nano - scale vibrational modes is their decay rate , which can be much smaller than the vibration frequency @xcite .",
    "the relaxation mechanisms include radiation into the bulk modes of the medium surrounding the nanosystem @xcite , nonlinear coupling between the modes localized inside the system @xcite , and coupling with electronic excitations@xcite and two - level defects @xcite .    conventionally ,",
    "decay of a vibrational mode is associated with an exponential fall - off of the vibration amplitude in time .",
    "this behavior is often observed in the experiment . in the phenomenological description of the mode dynamics , it comes from the friction force @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the vibration coordinate and @xmath4 is the friction coefficient .",
    "such friction is called linear .",
    "recent experiments have shown that , already for moderate vibration amplitudes , in various nano- and micromechanical systems the amplitude decay is nonexponential in time and/or the maximal amplitude of forced vibrations nonlinearly depends on the force amplitude @xcite ; respectively , the friction force is a nonlinear function of the mode coordinate and velocity .",
    "nonlinear friction ( nonlinear damping ) has recently attracted considerable attention also in the context of quantum information processing with microwave cavity modes , where it was engineered to be strong @xcite .",
    "nonlinear damping is well understood in quantum optics , where this is a major mechanism that limits the laser intensity @xcite .",
    "significantly less is known about mechanical systems . here , a simple microscopic mechanism is a decay process in which two quanta of the considered mode scatter into a quantum of a mode of a continuous spectrum @xcite . the corresponding process is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : decay_processes](a ) .",
    "it was implemented in @xcite . for graphene - based nanoresonators ,",
    "it was discussed for nonlinear leakage of the resonator modes into bulk modes @xcite , and it should be relevant for the decay into bulk modes ( clamping losses ) in other systems .",

    "scatter into a phonon of a continuous spectrum with frequency @xmath5 .",
    "( b ) four phonon scattering : a phonon of a continuous spectrum is scattered off the considered mode into another phonon , with the frequency change @xmath6 .",
    "the modes @xmath7 are not assumed to be plane waves.,width=240 ]    in this paper we develop a theory of nonlinear damping due to the anharmonic coupling between vibrational modes of a nano / micro system , which serves as a resonator .",
    "we consider the damping of a low - lying eigenmode .",
    "the mode eigenfrequency @xmath8 is assumed to be small compared to @xmath9 and the debye frequency of a crystal .",
    "at the same time , the mode decay rate is much smaller than @xmath8 , i.e. , the mode has a high quality factor .",
    "an important feature of nano- and microsystems is nonuniformity .",
    "familiar examples are ripples of the graphene sheets @xcite , bending and twisting of nanotubes , or layer thickness variations in multi - layer nanobeams .",
    "the scale of the nonuniformity @xmath10 should be compared with the wavelength @xmath11 and the mean free path @xmath12 of thermal phonons , i.e. , of phonons with frequencies @xmath13 . if both @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the absence of the nonuniformity are both small , @xmath14 , phonon transport can be described in terms of coordinate - dependent transport coefficients , for example , a coordinate - dependent thermal conductivity @xcite .",
    "a qualitatively different situation occurs if @xmath15 , as in rippled graphene membranes for low temperature @xcite .",
    "one has to be careful in defining @xmath12 in this case , as the normal vibrational modes are no longer plain waves , and @xmath12 should be defined as the scattering rate of these modes due to their nonlinear coupling with each other . in this case",
    "one can no longer use locally defined transport coefficients even where @xmath16 .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold : first , to develop a theory of damping of low - frequency vibrational modes in nonuniform systems and second , to study the nonlinear damping and dephasing .",
    "the theory is based on the eikonal formulation of the kinetics of thermal phonons .",
    "we use the term  phonon \" loosely to describe normal modes of a nanosystem that belong to the quasi - continuous spectrum , even though they are not plane waves .",
    "the phonons are enumerated by a quantum number @xmath17 which , for an ideal crystal , includes the wave vector and the branch number , and have frequencies @xmath18 .",
    "the nonlinear damping with decay into a single phonon , see fig .",
    "[ fig : decay_processes](a ) , comes primarily from the cubic anharmonicity of the vibrations @xcite . as mentioned earlier",
    ", this mechanism can be important for the nonlinear coupling to substrate phonons .",
    "however , it is less likely to work for decay into the modes localized within the system .",
    "this is because the localized low - frequency modes have a discrete spectrum , and the decay of the considered mode into one of these modes @xmath17 requires resonance @xmath19 .",
    "it also requires that the decay rate of the mode @xmath17 be much larger than the coupling and the decay rate of the considered mode .",
    "such fine tuning does not happen generically , but if it happened , the resulting nonlinear damping would be strong .    a more important contribution to the nonlinear damping can come from the processes described by the quartic anharmonicity . in such processes ,",
    "a phonon with frequency @xmath20 is scattered off the considered low - frequency mode into another high - frequency phonon , see fig .",
    "[ fig : decay_processes](b ) .",
    "it is implied that the spectrum of the involved phonons @xmath7 is quasi - continuous .",
    "this condition is met if the phonons are weakly confined to the resonator or @xmath12 is small compared to at least one of the resonator dimensions .",
    "the frequency change @xmath21 can be smaller than the decay rate of the involved high - frequency modes , which complicates the analysis .",
    "the conventional mechanisms of linear damping for bulk modes @xcite are based on the processes similar to those in fig .",
    "[ fig : decay_processes](b ) , except that the scattering of the high - frequency phonons is accompanied by absorption / emission of one quantum of the considered low - frequency mode .",
    "linear damping comes from the cubic nonlinearity .",
    "the results of this paper describe such damping in nonuniform systems .",
    "the rates of linear and nonlinear damping can become comparable even for comparatively small vibration amplitudes as a consequence of symmetry restrictions or the restrictions imposed by the energy and momentum conservation .",
    "the best known example where dissipation is due to quartic anharmonicity was proposed by landau and khalatnikov @xcite to describe phonon scattering in liquid helium .",
    "another example is suppression of the cubic - anharmonicity induced linear damping for flexural modes in flat atomically - thin membranes .",
    "it is rooted in the reflection symmetry , which allows nonlinear coupling that involves only an even number of flexural modes . ultimately , the linear damping is due to four - wave processes , with participation of four flexural modes or two flexural modes and two acoustic phonons @xcite . the nonlinear damping shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : decay_processes](b ) occurs in the same order in the anharmonicity and therefore has no additional smallness associated with the higher - order anharmonicity",
    ". this might be behind the numerically observed strong nonlinear damping in graphene nanomembranes @xcite .",
    "along with damping , scattering of phonons off the considered mode leads to its dephasing , i.e. , loss of coherence , as was first discussed for high - frequency vibrations localized near defects in solids @xcite .",
    "in contrast to damping , the scattering that leads to dephasing is quasi - elastic , the energy of the mode is not changed . to the lowest order ,",
    "the process comes from the quartic nonlinearity in the mode coupling , although the parameters are renormalized by the cubic nonlinearity , which is also the case for nonlinear friction .",
    "as we show , the formalism developed to describe nonlinear friction extends to the analysis of the dephasing rate .",
    "the dephasing we consider is a @xmath22-process , in the language of nuclear magnetic resonance .",
    "we will not consider @xmath23-type frequency noise , which usually does not come from nonlinear mode coupling .",
    "the problem of linear damping of low - frequency eigenmodes in nano- and micro - resonators overlaps with the problem of sound absorption in dielectrics , which has been intensely studied since 1930s @xcite , see @xcite and references therein for more recent work .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , the nonlinear damping has not been discussed nor has there been developed a theory for systems with the nonuniformity on the scale small compared to the mean free path of thermal phonons .",
    "our analysis of damping and dephasing of an underdamped low - frequency mode is based on the expressions that relate the relaxation rates to the correlators of the bath to which the mode is coupled , see sec .",
    "these correlators are the main object of interest .",
    "we consider the case where the bath is formed by phonons and the coupling to the bath is due to the vibration nonlinearity .",
    "then the correlators of interest are those of the pairs of the phonon variables and are related to the phonon density matrix weighted with the interaction .",
    "they are easy to calculate and to find the nonlinear damping where the frequency @xmath8 of the considered mode is large compared to the decay rates of thermal phonons , the landau - rumer limit , see sec .",
    "[ sec : lr ] . the problem becomes more complicated where the phonon decay can not be disregarded , and this is the central part of the paper .",
    "the analysis of the phonon correlators is done for nonuniform systems with an arbitrarily strong nonuniformity , which is however smooth on the typical wavelength @xmath11 of thermal modes .",
    "it is based on the eikonal approximation , as mentioned above .",
    "this approximation is developed in sec .",
    "[ sec : eikonal ] .",
    "the thermal modes ( phonons ) are characterized by coordinate - dependent wave vectors , and there holds approximate local momentum conservation in phonon scattering .",
    "the analysis of the dynamics can be conveniently done by writing the sought correlators in the wigner representation . we formulate it in sec .",

    "[ sec : qke ] we discuss the quantum transport equation for function @xmath28 .",
    "the derivation of this equation is somewhat cumbersome and is described in appendices a to d. our analysis suggests that , for smooth nonuniformity , this equation is local in space even where the characteristic nonuniformity length @xmath10 is small compared to the phonon mean free path @xmath12 , but still @xmath29 .",
    "the locality means that the scattering couples function @xmath24 to functions @xmath30 with different wave vectors and mode indices , but the same position . in sec .",

    "the results are used in sec .",
    "[ sec : thermoelastic ] to study nonlinear thermoelastic relaxation of a low - frequency mode .",
    "we show that this relaxation is of particular interest for lam modes in thin plates and also for flexural modes in thin nanobeams , where thermal diffusion transverse to the beam is fast compared to the mode vibrations ; this limit is opposite to the one where the zener linear thermoelastic damping is dominating .",
    "along with the microscopic theory we develop a phenomenological theory of nonlinear thermoelastic damping and show that they lead to the same results .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : akhiezer ] we briefly discuss the nonlinear akhiezer relaxation . as in the case of linear akhiezer relaxation , it is important where the mode frequencies are large compared to the reciprocal time of thermal diffusion .",
    "we show that the expressions for the akhiezer decay rate are grossly simplified in the @xmath31-approximation for the dynamics of thermal phonons ; however , the value of @xmath31 is generally different from that used to describe thermal diffusion .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : dephasing ] we discuss the dephasing of low - frequency vibrational modes due to their coupling to thermal phonons . for high - frequency modes , where the decay of thermal phonons can be disregarded , the theory is similar to the theory of dephasing for localized vibrations in solids @xcite . for smaller @xmath8 the decay of thermal phonons",

    "we have presented a microscopic theory of nonlinear decay and dephasing of low - frequency eigenmodes in nano- and micro - mechanical resonators . both phenomena are well - known to play an important role in the dynamics of mesoscopic vibrational systems .",

    "the analysis is not limited to spatially uniform systems , it also includes strongly nonuniform systems , with the nonuniformity scale exceeding the characteristic thermal wavelength but small compared to the mean free path of the thermal modes .",
    "the major steps of the analysis are as follows .",
    "first , we expressed the decay and dephasing rates in terms of the pair correlation functions of thermal vibrational modes weighted with the interaction .",
    "we then obtained a transport equation for these correlation functions .",
    "the decay and dephasing rates were expressed in terms of the eigenfunctions of this transport equation . closed form expressions",
    "were obtained for spatially uniform systems assuming that the coupling of the low - frequency mode to thermal phonons can be described in terms of nonlinear grneisen parameters , which is a natural extension to the nonlinear decay problem of the coupling used to describe linear decay of low - frequency modes .",
    "both the nonlinear damping and the dephasing come from scattering of thermal vibrational modes off the considered low - frequency modes .",
    "the damping is due to scattering with energy transfer @xmath0 , whereas the dephasing is due to quasielastic scattering . in the both cases",
    "the analysis could be done in terms of the wigner representation of the correlation function . for spatially uniform systems , where thermal vibrational modes are plane waves , the transport equation for the wigner function that we obtained can be shown to be equivalent to the linearized boltzmann equation , except for the initial conditions .    for systems with strong but smooth nonuniformity",
    "the modes can be described in the eikonal approximation .",
    "this makes it possible not only to introduce a scalar wigner representation of the correlation function , but also to derive a markovian kinetic equation for this function .",
    "we found that , in the scattering of short - wavelength thermal modes off each other , the sum of the coordinate - dependent wave vectors ( the gradients of the eikonal ) is approximately locally conserved ( except for the umklapp processes ) . as a result , it turns out that the transport equation for the wigner function as a function of a coordinate and a wave vector @xmath24 is local in space : this equation couples @xmath24 with functions @xmath30 with different wave numbers @xmath578 and different mode branches @xmath579 , but the same coordinate @xmath25 .",
    "we have shown that , similar to the case of linear damping , the mechanisms of nonlinear damping and dephasing can be conditionally separated into the landau - rumer , thermoelastic , and akhiezer - type . in the landau - rumer limit",
    "one disregards decay of the thermal modes responsible for the relaxation of the considered low - frequency mode .",
    "however , in the systems of interest the thermal mode decay plays a significant role , and we primarily concentrated on the effects of this decay .",
    "we found that nonlinear thermoelastic damping can be important even where linear thermoelastic damping is inefficient , for symmetry reasons or because the mode frequency is small compared to the rate of thermal diffusion transverse to the resonator .",
    "the rate of nonlinear damping is simply expressed in terms of the eigenmodes of the diffusion equation for temperature .",
    "we also developed a phenomenological formulation in terms of the free energy of the system , which takes into account the terms nonlinear in the strain produced by the considered low - frequency mode .",
    "the specific examples included nonlinear thermoelastic decay of lam and flexural modes , where the linear thermoelastic damping is suppressed .",
    "the nonlinear damping is due to thermal diffusion along rather than transverse to the system .",
    "we found the dependence of the damping on temperature and the geometric factors .",
    "the akhiezer nonlinear damping is similar to the akhiezer linear damping .",
    "this similarity is particularly clear in the developed formulation based on the eigenmodes of the transport equation .",
    "the akhiezer damping is due to the decay of the eigenmodes that are even in the wave vector @xmath26 . as a consequence ,",
    "if one uses the @xmath31-approximation for the decay of thermal modes , one should keep in mind that the value of the corresponding decay rate is generally different from the one that defines the thermal conductivity .",
    "this strongly affects the temperature dependence of the rate of nonlinear damping .",
    "we found that the dephasing rate may be significantly larger than the nonlinear damping rate .",
    "it contains an extra factor @xmath580 , which is large if the considered low - frequency mode is thermally excited ( the case of the primary interest in this work ) .",
