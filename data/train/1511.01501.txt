    "quantum magnets rank among the simplest model systems in condensed matter physics , but nonetheless exhibit some of its most fundamental phenomena , including quantum phase transitions , symmetry - breaking and restoration , collective and fractionalized excitations , topological order , and complex entanglement of the quantum wave function . from a theoretical point of view , these phenomena arise even in models with only the most elementary magnetic interaction , described by the heisenberg model @xcite , and depend crucially on the geometry of the lattice . in low - dimensional systems , quantum fluctuation effects are strong , and models in one spatial dimension provide particularly good examples of exotic phenomena @xcite , not least the gapped `` haldane '' state of the nearest - neighbor spin-1 chain @xcite and the exactly dimerized ground state , with fractional `` spinon '' excitations , of the frustrated spin-1/2 @xmath2-@xmath3 chain @xcite",
    ". in higher dimensions , models on bipartite lattices tend to show semi - classical long - ranged magnetic order , whereas geometrically frustrated lattices offer both analogs of the unconventional ground states of quantum spin chains and uniquely high - dimensional phases such as the quantum spin liquid @xcite .",
    "a frustrated two - dimensional system related to the @xmath2-@xmath3 chain is the shastry - sutherland model @xcite , which exhibits an exact dimer - singlet ground state .",
    "the compound srcu@xmath4(bo@xmath5)@xmath4 , based on @xmath0 cu@xmath6 ions , provides not only a good realization of this model , but one that is believed to be located close to a frustration - induced quantum phase transition out of the dimer - singlet phase @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", srcu@xmath4(bo@xmath5)@xmath4 displays a number of exotic properties , including a magnetization curve that exhibits many plateaus @xcite .",
    "the origin of this unusual behavior lies in the strong suppression of kinetic energy contributions from the triplet excitations , due to the almost perfectly frustrated coupling of the dimers in the shastry - sutherland model @xcite .",
    "when magnetic excitations become highly localized in this way , the related phenomenon of bound - state formation appears . in two - leg spin-1/2 ladders with little or no frustration , bound states",
    "are present in the spectrum at higher energies @xcite , whereas in strongly frustrated systems they can occur at low energies , particularly close to a quantum phase transition as in the shastry - sutherland model @xcite .",
    "the presence of additional low - energy states in the spectrum of a system is expected to have a clear signature in its physical properties . despite the fact that the thermodynamic properties are frequently used as one of the first experimental characterizations of any new material , their computation actually constitutes a major challenge for theory .",
    "exact results for the finite - temperature properties of truly quantum models are scarce , being restricted to integrable systems such as the nearest - neighbor spin-1/2 heisenberg chain @xcite , which can be solved by generalizations of the bethe ansatz @xcite .    among the numerical approaches to this problem , one of the first to be used was the full exact diagonalization ( ed ) of the hamiltonian in the exponentially large hilbert space @xcite .",
    "although this method can be extended as far as 24 spin-1/2 sites with current technology @xcite , standard applications are limited to approximately 20 @xmath0 sites @xcite , a size with restricted applicability in two and higher dimensions .",
    "another classic approach is the use of high - temperature series expansions @xcite , but frustrated systems such as the shastry - sutherland model @xcite illustrate the difficulties suffered by this method in accessing the low - temperature regime .",
    "finite - temperature variants of the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) technique @xcite such as a quantum transfer - matrix formulation @xcite , imaginary time evolution in an enlarged hilbert space @xcite , and minimally entangled typical thermal states @xcite have been developed into powerful tools for calculating the thermodynamic properties of one - dimensional systems , but despite the development of modern matrix - product - state formulations @xcite , these methods have mostly remained limited to one dimension .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations provide the most flexible approach in higher dimensions , and are able to resolve the primary features of the thermodynamic quantities for models that are at most weakly frustrated @xcite , but these break down in more strongly frustrated systems due to the notorious qmc sign problem .",
    "quantum spin and the heisenberg couplings between spins are specified by the parameters @xmath7 for the ladder rungs , @xmath8 for the ladder legs , and @xmath9 for the cross - plaquette couplings , which we take to be symmetrical .",
    "ellipsoids represent singlet states of the two rung spins and their absence a rung triplet . ]    as a consequence of these technical limitations , there has been little systematic investigation of the finite - temperature response of quantum spin systems with strong geometrical frustration , and thus the influence both of bound states in the excitation spectrum and of proximity to a quantum critical point on the thermodynamic properties remains poorly understood . here",
    "we provide a detailed analysis of these issues using the model of the fully frustrated two - leg spin-1/2 ladder , which is shown in fig .",

    "the importance of multi - triplet bound - state excitations was also recognized in early analytical studies of the fully frustrated ladder @xcite and observed in a dmrg calculation @xcite .",
    "building on these analytical properties , we perform and interpret detailed numerical calculations of the magnetic specific heat and susceptibility of the fully frustrated ladder . with a view to a complete microscopic understanding of the spectrum , and profiting from the very short correlation length of the fully frustrated system ,",
    "our tool of choice for this investigation is ed rather than a finite - temperature variant of dmrg .",
    "we will show that this model permits a detailed analysis of the excitation spectrum , which shows a highly unconventional emergence of multi - particle bound states involving very many rungs near the quantum phase transition . because this feature exceeds the system - size limitations of ed",
    ", we exploit the properties of the model to express the spin hamiltonian in the dimer basis and achieve the ability to perform qmc simulations completely free of the sign problem .",
    "these we employ to compute the numerically exact specific heat and susceptibility for ladders of up to 400 spins , which we show is well in the thermodynamic limit even for systems arbitrarily close to the quantum phase transition .",

    "[ sec : ffl ] we introduce the fully frustrated ladder model and highlight some of its analytical properties .",
    "these allow us to review the ground - state phase diagram , to discuss the nature of the low - energy excitations in the two different phases , which include exact and perfectly localized bound states , and to highlight the appearance of many low - lying states near the phase transition .",
    "we then use these properties in an analytical discussion of a simple approximation to the thermodynamics of the fully frustrated ladder in the rung - singlet phase and compare its qualitative features with those of unfrustrated ladders . because a systematic analysis of thermodynamic properties , particularly near the phase transition , requires exact numerical results , in sec .",

    ", one may conclude @xcite that the critical coupling constant for the quantum phase transition is @xmath39 with a view to discussing the thermodynamic properties of the fully frustrated ladder , in the remainder of this subsection we analyze the spin excitations above the two different ground states .",
    "the fundamental excitation of the rung - singlet state is a single rung triplet , represented schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : s ] . in conventional 1d systems , this is a collective mode involving all rungs , and for clarity we refer to it henceforth as the triplon . in the fully frustrated ladder ,",
    "the triplon is a non - dispersive mode with a flat band at energy @xmath40 .",
    "further , it has been shown that the @xmath27-triplet clusters within the rung - singlet state form exact bound states @xcite , which are fully localized objects @xcite , and therefore are also non - dispersive .",

    "fig : signjr2qmctest ] is now identically equal to 1 .",
    "this occurs because the chain of rung `` super - sites '' forms a bipartite lattice on which the exchange interactions between nearest - neighbor total spins ( @xmath51 ) are bilinear ( [ eq : exeh ] ) . by using a similar amount of cpu time for simulations in the dimer basis as for the single - site basis",

    "[ fig : chijr2qmctest ] .",
    "the results resolve not only the maximum of @xmath52 but also the complete low - temperature behavior all the way to @xmath53 . however , here we find a different consequence of the extensive number of local conservation laws in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exeh ] ) , namely that these hinder an effective mixing of the local spin states . as a result ,",
    "the autocorrelation and thermalization times become very large at low temperatures and close to the quantum phase transition [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : jcrit ] ) ] , requiring further modification of our approach .    to perform qmc simulations for suitably large system sizes under these circumstances , we employed a standard parallel tempering protocol @xcite over a set of 64 temperatures , although 32 values were found to be sufficient at coupling ratios far from the phase transition .",
    "each replica was passed through an initial annealing phase , where it was heated slowly from an appropriate low - temperature state to its target temperature .",
    "the simulations were initialized by taking as the sse base state ( with an empty operator string ) a rung - singlet product state for @xmath54 within the rung - singlet phase ( @xmath55 ) and an antiferromagnetic nel state for @xmath54 within the rung - triplet phase ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the parallel tempering swap rates were adapted to allow for sufficient autocorrelation of the replicas between swaps .",
    "we comment here that a dimer - basis description appears natural for quantum magnets with a dimerization in their interaction geometry .",
    "the qmc simulation scheme presented here can be extended to the case of arbitrary spin systems whose interactions are bilinear when reexpressed in the basis of spin - dimer singlet and triplet states .",
    "in addition to interdimer exchange couplings based on @xmath57 operators , which we denote as @xmath58-type terms , the most general case would also include couplings of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 types . for models with @xmath58 terms only , and for which the dimer super - sites form a bipartite lattice , the qmc sign problem is completely eliminated , as in the fully frustrated spin ladder .",
    "in fact all such models are strongly constrained by local conservation laws on every spin dimer , but any additional interaction terms break these laws explicitly .",
    "local transitions then become possible between the singlet and triplet sectors , allowing for a more efficient mixing of states within qmc simulations , but at the price that such additional interaction terms lead generically to a qmc sign problem ( even in the spin - dimer basis ) .    in table",
    "[ tab : matele ] , we find that ( i ) the @xmath57 operators do not create transitions between singlet and triplet sectors and ( ii ) the @xmath62 operators do swap local @xmath63 and @xmath64 states . in a model containing only @xmath58 and @xmath65 terms , and with a bipartite structure of couplings between dimers on different sublattices only , again the sign problem is completely absent , because the periodic boundary conditions in the discrete imaginary - time propagation direction mandate that only even numbers of interdimer @xmath65 terms can create allowed qmc configurations .",
    "all allowed configurations then contribute to the quantum partition function with positive weight ( this is a straightforward generalization of the reason that no sign problem plagues world - line simulations of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on a bipartite lattice ) @xcite .",
    "however , we note that in such a model su(2 ) symmetry is broken explicitly .",
    "these considerations highlight that special cases exist for particular subsets of interaction terms , which can be handled by qmc without generating a sign problem at all . for more general systems with dimerized ground states",
    "@xcite , the possibility arises that , even when non - positive qmc weights can occur , a simulation may have only a mild qmc sign problem because the ground state is a direct product state ( of dimer singlets ) .",
    "further analysis to assess the full potential of the spin - dimer - based approaches to qmc lies beyond the scope of this study .",
    "we highlight only one further extension of these ideas , to consider the construction of more general computational bases , formed from larger lattice units , or simplices , such as triangles @xcite or four - site plaquettes @xcite .",
    "the development of simplex - qmc methods to explore geometries and interactions providing sign - problem - free or sign - problem - suppressed simulations can be expected to provide valuable progress in frustrated quantum magnetism .",
    "in this section we present our numerical results for the thermodynamic properties of the fully frustrated ladder and of some unfrustrated comparison cases .",
    "we begin by ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our calculations by comparing the results from ed and qmc , primarily to verify that finite - size effects are under control throughout the phase diagram , including in the vicinity of the critical point [ eq .  ( [ eq : jcrit ] ) ] .",
    "we present the basic phenomenology of the magnetic specific heat , @xmath66 , and susceptibility , @xmath52 , in terms of the physical features emerging as the interaction parameters are changed in two directions , from rung - singlet to rung - triplet ladders and from fully frustrated to unfrustrated ladders . following the results of sec .",

    "we defer to sec .",
    "[ sec : interp ] a deeper analysis of our results and of their interpretation using the information about the spectrum presented in sec .",
    "[ ssec : spec ] .",
    "however , for the most elementary understanding of the response functions it is worth recalling that the specific heat is a consequence of all states and therefore reflects primarily the singlet bound states in the vicinity of @xmath68 , whereas the susceptibility is a consequence of all magnetic states and therefore reflects primarily triplet bound states .",
    "+   +   +     with a view to benchmarking the quality of our numerical calculations , fig .  [",
    "fig : compedqmc ] compares ed and qmc results for the specific heat and susceptibility of fully frustrated ladders with four different values of the ratio @xmath43 , selected in the rung - singlet phase far from @xmath68 , in the rung - singlet phase close to @xmath68 , and similarly in the rung - triplet phase .",
    "every panel shows ed results calculated for ladders of 10 , 12 , and 14 rungs , along with qmc data for 100-rung ladders and additional qmc results from 200-rung ladders when @xmath54 is close to @xmath68 .",
    "quite generally , all the susceptibility curves are nearly indistinguishable , meaning that finite - size effects in @xmath52 are extremely small , and we focus most of our comments on the specific - heat results .",
    "the fact that identical curves are obtained for the specific heat of the @xmath69 ladder ( top ) indicates that a system with @xmath70 rungs can be considered as a good approximation to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "by contrast , finite - size effects are significantly more important at @xmath71 , where there is a systematic shift of the peak to the left from @xmath70 to 12 to 14 , and none of the ed calculations capture the peak position of the qmc results . although this type of shift could be interpreted as reflecting the importance of longer clusters , in the same way as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : atc ] , it may seem surprising that clusters of more than 10 rungs could make a discernible difference at @xmath72 , given that the ground state is still a simple product of rung singlets . however , we recall that in systems of the sizes accessible by ed , the lowest excitation in this regime is actually the `` intruder '' state , which is the ground state on the rung - triplet side of the transition , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ed14x2exec ] and discussed in sec .",
    "[ ssec : spec ] , and this causes differences in the thermodynamic response . here",
    "we also include qmc results for a ladder of @xmath1 rungs , and these make clear that all finite - size phenomena are thoroughly suppressed in our @xmath73 data .",
    "turning to the rung - triplet side of the transition , the same finite - size effects are visible at @xmath74 as at 1.42 ; in fact they are slightly more pronounced , to the extent that they are visible in the corresponding curve for the susceptibility , where we draw attention to the different temperatures at the center of the rapid rise .",
    "thus it is clear that the thermodynamic response of the haldane phase close to the critical point is significantly affected by the intruding rung - singlet ground state .",
    "whether large clusters ( of rung singlets ) or the one - magnon band of the haldane chain play a role here is unclear . moving well into the haldane phase , at @xmath75 we observe finite - size effects not in the position of the specific - heat peak at @xmath76 but in its height .",
    "this type of size effect can be found in calculations of the haldane ( spin-1 heisenberg ) chain @xcite , and thus its appearance in the rung - triplet phase of the ladder suggests that it is due to long spin-1 chain segments separated by excited rung singlets . from our results and also from those for the haldane chain , the qmc data for @xmath73 can be considered as fully converged to the thermodynamic limit for this choice of parameters . for thermodynamic purposes , we take finite - size effects to be negligible in the fully frustrated ladder of @xmath73 rungs for all values of @xmath7 .",

    "we reiterate that the specific heat is a measure of all states in the spectrum and in a frustrated system can be strongly affected by total - spin singlets ( usually the lowest - lying states in an antiferromagnet ) of multi - particle origin ; this is very much the case in the fully frustrated ladder .",

    "we propose that @xmath162 remains an appropriate measure of the effective correlation length , albeit with two different quantities , @xmath163 and @xmath164 , required to characterize respectively non - magnetic and magnetic correlations near @xmath68 on the rung - singlet side .    regarding the direct experimental relevance of our results , we noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] that the material srcu@xmath4(bo@xmath5)@xmath4 shows a number of anomalous features in its thermodynamic response .",
    "the susceptibility has been found @xcite to exhibit a sharp drop at a temperature about one tenth of the dominant coupling energy , whereas the specific heat @xcite has a sharp maximum near the same temperature .",
    "this system is thought to be a good realization of the ( spin-1/2 ) shastry - sutherland model @xcite , which is intrinsically two - dimensional , but shares two essential features of the fully frustrated ladder .",
    "one is that the one - triplon band is nearly flat , dispersing perhaps due primarily to higher - order dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions .",
    "the other is that the magnetic interaction parameters deduced for this compound place it in a dimer - singlet phase , but very close to a quantum phase transition to a different ground state , thought to be a type of plaquette order @xcite . certainly , the trends we observe for the thermodynamic properties of the fully frustrated ladder in the rung - singlet phase close to the transition are remarkably similar to srcu@xmath4(bo@xmath5)@xmath4 , at least for the specific heat .",
    "the susceptibility of the ladder model is not as close ( fig .  [ fig : qmc100x2thermo ] ) , with the temperature scale remaining higher and the maximum appearing more rounded .",
    "srcu@xmath4(bo@xmath5)@xmath4 is also known from two - magnon raman @xcite and inelastic neutron scattering measurements @xcite to show a highly anomalous thermal evolution of the spectral weight , and this may also be interpreted @xcite on the basis of the spectrum in subsec .",
    "[ ssec : spec ] .",
    "we speculate that the type of behavior we have investigated here may arise in other frustrated spin systems with quantum phase transitions .    in this context , it is worth considering the possibilities for the creation of non - thermal transitions in low - dimensional magnets .",
    "the most successful approach to date , applied in a number of systems , is the use of a hydrostatic pressure to alter the magnetic exchange interactions and thus to drive the system towards a critical point . in the event",
    "that this can be realized , strong changes can be expected in the spectrum that bring many levels to low energies or even to zero .",
    "thus one would have the possibility of observing the type of evolution exhibited here for the fully frustrated ladder not only as a function of temperature but also as a function of pressure at a fixed , low temperature .",
    "finally , we comment that another prime possibility for the creation of quantum phase transitions is the application of a magnetic field .",
    "the field couples only to magnetic states , and the effect would be to bring down one component of all the triplets . in a model as rich as the fully frustrated ladder , with significantly different singlet and triplet spectra , this would cause very strong and inequivalent alterations to @xmath66 and @xmath52 .",
    "the phase diagram as a function of applied field and coupling ratio was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of jumps and plateaus in the magnetization curve , whose nature has also been discussed in ref .",
    "deep in the rung - singlet regime ( specifically , @xmath165 ) , the field - induced transition out of the rung - singlet phase is expected to be first order , in fact to a mixed rung - singlet/-triplet state with no threefold degeneracy on each rung and with a finite gap . in the rung - triplet phase ( @xmath157 ) , the spectrum is continuous beyond the one - magnon gap and therefore the applied field causes a second - order transition to a gapless state .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that there exists an intermediate regime , @xmath166 , where the field - induced transition is first - order and also leads to a gapless state with triplets on all rungs .",
    "the fully frustrated ladder in a magnetic field offers a further set of unconventional phenomena related to its exact bound states , flat bands , and high quasidegeneracies of energy levels near the coupling - induced quantum phase transition .",
    "we have investigated the thermodynamic properties of the fully frustrated two - leg spin-1/2 ladder .",
    "this system exhibits a first - order quantum phase transition between a rung - singlet regime for strong rung coupling and a rung - triplet , or haldane , phase for weak rung coupling . for all values of the coupling ratio ,",
    "the system has a gap to all excitations , and the magnetic specific heat and susceptibility are exponentially activated at low temperatures , followed by a single peak .",
    "however , in the vicinity of the transition point , the two quantities are characterized by different gaps in the low - energy spectrum on the rung - singlet side , and these gaps , the peaks , peak widths , and peak heights all show a dependence on the coupling constants quite different from reference systems such as the unfrustrated ladder , the spin-1 heisenberg chain , or the frustrated @xmath0 @xmath2@xmath3 chain .",
    "the physics behind this anomalous behavior lies in the formation of multi - particle bound states .",
    "single - rung excitations are localized objects , and so are their pairs , threesomes , and all higher @xmath27-excitation clusters , which may then be treated as open chains . on approaching the transition point",
    ", we observe the formation of large numbers of low - energy states , particularly singlets and triplets of the many - particle clusters , which lead to strongly enhanced fluctuations in this regime .",
    "these give rise to a sharp , and anomalously low - temperature , maximum in the specific heat and to an abrupt fall in effective response temperature of the susceptibility , results we show are quite different from the response of unfrustrated ladders .",
    "we comment that all of these effects may be expected to have a corresponding signature in the dynamical response function of the fully frustrated ladder at finite temperatures , which is the topic of a companion investigation @xcite .",
    "we have obtained extremely precise results by detailed numerical calculations using two techniques , ed and qmc , both of which work very well for this model .",
    "ed methods are usually restricted to small system sizes , which here we have extended to 28 sites by exploiting the exact relationship between the states of the fully frustrated ladder and of open and closed spin-1 chains .",
    "the very short correlation length of the highly frustrated system is also advantageous for capturing most of the physics using a small system .",
    "the hamiltonian in the rung basis ( [ eq : exeh ] ) also ensures the complete absence of a sign problem in qmc simulations , allowing us to obtain results for ladders up to @xmath1 rungs that are demonstrably far into the thermodynamic limit .",
    "elimination of the sign problem by suitable choice of the basis is not new @xcite , but when applied in models where the total spin of the dimer ( or other simplex unit ) is conserved gives rise to the possibility of very powerful qmc approaches to frustrated spin systems .",
    "methodological ideas and qmc results similar to ours for the fully frustrated ladder are reported in ref .",
    "the next natural steps in this context are to test the performance of qmc simulations in the rung basis when the sign problem is not completely eliminated ( for example in the ladder model of eq .",
    "( [ eq : essh ] ) with @xmath167 @xcite ) and to seek other geometries , interactions , and bases where the sign problem is absent .",
    "two very general aspects of our results are of direct relevance to experimental studies of low - dimensional frustrated systems .",
    "one is the propensity of frustrated systems to bound - state formation , leading to the possibility of high densities of localized ( narrow- or flat - band ) excitations , which have a strong effect on the physical properties of the system .",
    "the other is the effect of proximity to a quantum phase transition , which leads to strong changes in the spectrum and may thus push high densities of states to low energies , with dramatic effects on both the thermodynamic and the dynamical response .",
    "both features may already have been observed in the two - dimensional compound srcu@xmath4(bo@xmath5)@xmath4 , a system whose `` shastry - sutherland '' geometry is so frustrated that the one - triplon band is almost completely flat and whose exchange constants are believed to place it in the dimer - singlet phase ( the equivalent of the rung - singlet phase for the ladder ) , but very near the quantum phase transition to a suspected plaquette state .",
    "indeed the specific heat , susceptibility , and dynamical structure factor measured for this material show some of the anomalous properties we have observed in one dimension in the fully frustrated ladder .",
    "the advances of this work , both in analytical understanding and in numerical capabilities , may be expected to assist in computing the thermodynamic properties of a broad range of frustrated models in the near future .",
