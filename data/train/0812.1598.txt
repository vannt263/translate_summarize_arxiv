    "inverse n vs.  c , o anomalies in ob absorption - line spectra , denoted as obn and obc , have been described by walborn ( 1976 , 2003 ) .",
    "it is now generally accepted that the morphologically normal majority of ob supergiants display an admixture of cno - cycled material in their atmospheres and winds , while the relatively rare obc objects have physically normal ( i.e. , main - sequence ) cno abundances , and the obn may have enhanced mixing as a result of additional effects such as binary interactions or rapid initial rotational velocities , with homogeneous evolution in extreme cases ( maeder & meynet 2000 ) .    for instrumental and historical reasons , as well as sometimes scientific ones , optical stellar spectroscopy has usually concentrated on certain wavelength regions , such as the blue - violet or the red . as a result , new phenomena may be encountered when the orphan regions are examined .",
    "a recent example is the unexpected discovery of cno anomalies in o2 spectra , from a survey of the 3400    region ( walborn et  al.2004 ; morrell et  al .",
    "another example is the subject of this report , arising from a digital ob spectral - classification atlas extending somewhat beyond the traditional blue - violet limit around h@xmath2 ( http://www.fcaglp.unlp.edu.ar/@xmath3mariela/atlas-mariela/index.htm ) .    the spectrum of hde  269896 (= radcliffe ( r ) 129 , sanduleak ( sk ) @xmath4 ) , one of the brightest ob stars in the large magellanic cloud , was first described in detail by hyland & bessell ( 1975 ) and walborn ( 1977 ) .",
    "it displays two unusual characteristics : an emission line of he  ii @xmath14686 at its relatively late spectral type , and the cno absorption - line intensity anomalies that define the on supergiant class . at earlier spectral types ,",
    "the @xmath14686 emission ( of ) effect is a luminosity indicator ( walborn 1971 , 1973 , 2008 ; walborn & fitzpatrick 1990 ) ; hence , its presence in this spectrum was interpreted as an effect of superluminosity , which is supported by the very bright @xmath5 of @xmath68.1 , a magnitude brighter than typical ia supergiants .",
    "thus , this spectrum was classified on9.7  ia@xmath0 by walborn ( 1977 ) .",
    "the observations for the atlas , including hde  269896 and several comparison objects shown below , were obtained by m.a.c . at the casleo `` jorge sahade '' 2.15  m telescope in san juan , argentina , during 20012004 .",
    "( hde  269896 was observed on 2001 february 5 . )",
    "the reosc echelle spectrograph ( on loan from the institut dastrophysique de lige ) was used in its non - echelle mode with a 200300  @xmath7 m slit ; a 600  l  mm@xmath8 grating ; and a tek @xmath9 , 24  @xmath7 m pixel ccd , covering the 37005600    range at a reciprocal dispersion of 1.64    pix@xmath8 ( resolution @xmath10   ) and typical s / n of 150200 .",
    "the exposure times ranged from 20  s for @xmath7  normae to 600  s for hde  269896 ( @xmath11  =  11.36 , ( @xmath12 )  =  0.00 ) .",
    "reductions were performed with standard iraf routines .",
    "( iraf is distributed by noao , operated by aura , inc .",
    ", under agreement with the nsf . )",
    "we also make use of high - resolution spectroscopy of hde  269896 from the ultraviolet - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) at the european southern observatory very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "these data are described and discussed by evans et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) ; they were obtained by l.  kaper .",
    "the low - resolution spectrogram of hde  269896 is shown in figure  1 , together those of four galactic on , oc , and normal supergiants of the same spectral type for comparison .",
    "all of these spectra are also compared by walborn & fitzpatrick ( 1990 ) at twice the resolution , but only to 4750   .",
    "the absorption - line cno anomalies are best seen here in the ratio of n  iii @xmath14640 to c  iii @xmath14650 .",
    "hde  269896 also stands out by its strong h@xmath2 emission , weakened h@xmath13 absorption , and he  ii @xmath14686 emission , which are diagnostics of its higher luminosity .",
    "in addition , it is now seen to have a strong n  ii 5000    emission feature , which is present more weakly in the other on supergiant hd  105056 , but completely absent in the oc and normal objects .",
    "this n  ii feature is a blend of several lines , as shown in high - resolution data for hd  105056 by walborn ( 2001 ) , and more weakly still in some related northern objects by walborn & howarth ( 2000 ) .",
    "thus , it is a further important diagnostic of nitrogen enhancement , and perhaps luminosity as well , in late - o supergiants .",
    "sections of the vlt / uves observation of hde  269896 are displayed in figures  2 , 3 , and 4 , and compared with three different model fits .",
    "the model parameters are specified in table  1 , and equivalent - width ( ew ) measurements of n  ii lines in both the data and the models are listed in table  2 .",
    "negative ew values signify emission lines .",
    "the transitions are shown with the upper levels first , as appropriate for emission lines .",
    "relative intensities of the lines from the nist atomic spectra database ( ralchenko et  al .",
    "2008 ) are also listed , to emphasize that they are all comparable . however , as seen in the figures and table , in the stellar spectrum the lines fall into two groups with qualitatively distinct behaviors : those with absorption or incipient p  cygni profiles , and those with narrow , symmetrical emission profiles .",
    "the latter are typical selective emission lines , as reviewed and discussed in detail by walborn ( 2001 ) .",
    "the uves data show that the next n  ii downward transitions , in the @xmath15700 region , not discussed here , are also in selective emission in hde  269896 .",
    "the ionization potentials of h@xmath14 , n@xmath0 , and he@xmath0 are 13.6 , 29.6 , and 54.4  ev , respectively .",
    "it is surprising to see both n  ii and he  ii features in the same spectrum ; the former corresponds to later and the latter to earlier spectral types than that of hde  269896 .",
    "thus , this superluminous object must have an unusually extended atmosphere with a large range of ionization conditions .",
    "these features together provide constraints on models of this atmosphere , as substantiated below .",
    "fitzpatrick ( 1991 ) discovered an interesting lmc relative of hde  269896 , namely sk  @xmath15 , o9.7  ia@xmath0 .",
    "as implied by the spectral type , it has similar values of the classification criteria , including he  ii @xmath14686 emission ( albeit somewhat weaker , consistent with its fainter but still superluminous @xmath5 of @xmath67.5 ) , and morphologically normal cno features .",
    "the optical spectra of both objects are illustrated by fitzpatrick ( 1991 ) , and their uv spectra from 900 through 1900    by walborn , parker , & nichols ( 1995 ) and walborn et  al .",
    "( 2002a ) .",
    "comparative astrophysical analyses of these two stars are of considerable interest .    indeed , they have been analyzed similarly by crowther et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) and evans et  al .",
    "sections of the spectrum of hde  269896 analyzed in the latter paper are reproduced here in figures  24 , and compared with the adopted model spectrum in green .",
    "it is seen that , while fitting the he  i absorption lines well , the adopted model does not reproduce any of the n  ii or he  ii emission lines ; in fact , it does not reproduce the n  iii absorption - line strengths , either . fortunately , two other , unpublished trial models run at the same time are available",
    "; they are also shown here , in blue and red .",
    "the blue model , with an increased n abundance ( table  1 ) , does not produce emission lines , either .",
    "however , the red model , with a similarly increased n abundance , but also somewhat lower effective temperature and increased mass - loss rate , does produce both n  ii and he  ii emission lines ; actually , the n  ii emission is somewhat overestimated ( table  2 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the he  i lines are badly underproduced , which is why this model was not favored at the time .",
    "d.  lennon ( priv .",
    "comm . ) has suggested that increasing the he abundance above the number ratio to h of 0.2 adopted by evans et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) may remedy this discrepancy .",
    "the results discussed here indicate that it may well be possible to reproduce most features in the optical spectrum of hde  269896 with relatively small adjustments to the model parameters .",
    "it is also very important to understand the atomic processes that produce the selective emission lines in o - type spectra , as emphasized by walborn ( 2001 ) .",
    "these are lines that come into emission while others from the same ions remain in absorption ; they are for the most part photospheric and respond to the temperature and luminosity . a striking analogy to the n  ii lines discussed here , but at higher ionization , is provided by the selective emission in n  iv @xmath14058 vs. the absorption or p  cygni profiles in the @xmath13480 blend from the same ion , in early - o spectra ( walborn et  al .  2004 ; morrell et  al .",
    "it is remarkable that current models can produce these emission lines ; evidently the essential physics has been correctly incorporated .",
    "however , there has been no systematic effort to extract and elucidate the mechanisms involved , as was done for the of n  iii @xmath164634 - 4640 - 4642 triplet by mihalas , hummer , & conti ( 1972 ) and mihalas & hummer ( 1973 ) .",
    "such an effort will certainly provide interesting insights into the ionic level - population processes , and in turn further sensitive diagnostics for hot atmospheres .",
    "finally , it is interesting to compare hde  269896 to other objects showing these n  ii emission lines , particularly the wn10 and wn11 types defined by crowther & smith ( 1997 ) ; see also smith , crowther , & prinja ( 1994 ) .",
    "these objects have much more extensive emission - line spectra , including a strong he  i @xmath15016 p cygni profile adjacent to and blended with the n  ii feature , which diagnose much denser winds .",
    "their typical he / h ratios range from 0.3 to 0.6 .",
    "clearly hde  269896 is a highly evolved object , but less so than the wn10/11 stars .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to propose that it may be in an immediate pre - wnvl ( very late wn ) stage , i.e. , that it will develop a denser , slower wind , a more extensive emission - line spectrum , and a higher surface he / h ratio as its evolution proceeds .",
    "many ( perhaps all ) wnvl objects are now recognized as quiescent states of luminous blue variables ( walborn et  al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) , and hde  269896 has a comparable luminosity ( humphreys & davidson 1994 ) .",
    "hde  269896 is located in relative isolation , north of 30  doradus , but near the o2  iii(f * ) star sk  @xmath17 , also a very massive , likely wn progenitor ( walborn et  al .",
