    "in this paper , we discuss an algorithm for the rapid numerical solution of smooth , nonlinear , non - autonomous , time - periodic , dissipative differential equations , with reference to a particular example , known as the spin - orbit equation .",
    "the spin - orbit ordinary differential equation ( ode ) describes the coupling , in the presence of tidal friction , between the orbital and rotational motion of an ellipsoidal satellite orbiting a primary , and many authors have studied it since the original work of  @xcite and  @xcite ; see also  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite . in cases of interest , both the nonlinear and the dissipative terms",
    "are multiplied by small parameters , and as the dissipation parameter decreases , the ode possesses an ever - increasing number of co - existing periodic orbits , with the initial conditions selecting which one is observed .",
    "in this sense , the problem is not simple , despite the fact that the nonlinearity is small : small dissipation coupled with small nonlinearity leads here to non - trivial dynamics .",
    "one interesting application of the spin - orbit equation is as a model of the orbit of mercury , whose primary is considered to be the sun ; other applications come to mind with the discovery of extra - solar planetary systems .",
    "the orbit of mercury appears to be unique in the solar system , since it rotates three times on its own axis for every two orbits of the sun : all other regular satellites for which we have data are in a one - to - one resonance with their primaries .",
    "see for instance  @xcite for a recent survey offering a new perspective on the problem .    in order to estimate numerically the probability of capture of a satellite in a given orbit ,",
    "one possibility is to use a monte carlo approach , in which the spin - orbit ode is integrated forward in time , starting from many uniformly - distributed random initial conditions .",
    "the time - asymptotic behaviour , that is , the solution after any transient has decayed , is determined for each of these initial conditions , and the probability of capture by each of the possible attractors is thereby estimated .",
    "the challenges of this approach are ( a ) that realistic values of the dissipation parameter @xmath0 are small , so transient times , which are @xmath1  see  @xcite for an argument in a similar case  are long ; and ( b ) , in order to obtain low - error estimates of capture probabilities , a large number @xmath2 of initial conditions must be considered : in fact , the width of the 95% confidence interval for the probabilities is proportional to @xmath3  see equation  ( [ conf ] ) . in interesting cases , that is when @xmath0 is small , ( a ) and ( b ) force one to carry out a large number of simulations of orbit dynamics , each one over a long time interval , which , using traditional numerical ode solvers , requires prohibitively long computation times . for a problem such as this ,",
    "we therefore conclude that a fast ode solving algorithm is a necessity and not a luxury .",
    "many problems in mathematical physics boil down to solving an ode for which no closed - form solution exists . for simulations in such cases , there is no alternative but to approximate solutions numerically .",
    "also , the solutions to nonlinear problems can display sensitive dependence to initial conditions .",
    "this raises questions as to how good a representation of what we casually refer to as ` the solution ' to an initial value problem , is actually obtainable numerically .",
    "contrast a finite precision numerical solution to the notional ` true solution '  one which is computed to infinitely high precision , but the computation of which can be done in a finite time . clearly the latter is unattainable with real computing hardware , with its finite memory and speed .",
    "hence , in practice , the best we can do is to use finite - precision , usually double precision ( typically 1617 significant figures ) algorithms , to model , approximately , the true solution .",
    "although software for arbitrary - precision arithmetic is available , we want to show here what can be achieved using only double precision ( with one exception ) .",
    "the question then becomes : how might we construct a practical algorithm to approximate the true solution , using standard double precision arithmetic , while also bearing in mind the need to obtain solutions quickly ?",
    "we describe in this paper an algorithm that speeds up the solution process by a factor of at least 7 compared to ` traditional ' numerical ode solvers , such as standard algorithms like runge - kutta  @xcite and symplectic numerical methods , for instance the yoshida algorithm  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix f ) .",
    "the latter has been used to solve the spin - orbit problem in the past , for example in  @xcite .",
    "these algorithms and many more like them are general - purpose methods that work for a wide variety of problems .",
    "by contrast , our algorithm is specific to a particular problem , but , since it is set up by computer algebra , only small changes need to be made to the set - up code in order to modify it for a different problem ; with this proviso , our algorithm is also general - purpose .",
    "our algorithm works well for problems like the spin - orbit ode , for which we carry out a careful comparison of our numerical results with those obtained analytically , via perturbation theory , as well as published results on attractor probabilities , in order to validate our work . setting up the algorithm relies on computer algebra , and running the algorithm at speed requires a low - level computer language ; the interplay between these two forms of computation is a theme in the paper .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the spin - orbit ode is given and a fast solution algorithm is described in sect .",
    "[ alg_sec ] .",
    "details on setting up the algorithm and some practical data are given in sect .",
    "[ setup_sec ] , and verification is reported in sect .",
    "[ ver_sec ] . in sect .",
    "[ perf_sec ] , we give details of the speed and the robustness of the algorithm , and in sect .",
    "[ conc_sec ] we draw some conclusions .",
    "the perturbation theory calculations which underpin the verifications are carried out in the appendix , which also contains some further supplementary material .",
    "we consider the spin - orbit ode : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 , so that the phase space is @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is a small parameter , related to the asymmetry of the equatorial moments of inertia of the satellite , and @xmath9 is the eccentricity of the orbit  @xcite . from here",
    "onwards we set @xmath10 .",
    "we follow  @xcite in setting @xmath11 ; we also write @xmath12 , where @xmath13 furthermore , @xmath14 and @xmath15 the expressions for @xmath16 and @xmath17 have been obtained by averaging , and those for @xmath18 have been derived by solving the kepler relations up to @xmath19  @xcite , truncation at this order leading to the neglect of all harmonics outside the set @xmath20 .    the dissipation model in equation  ( [ ode ] ) is known as macdonald s tidal torque  @xcite .",
    "it has been widely studied since the pioneering work of goldreich and peale  @xcite , even though its validity has recently been questioned ; see for instance  @xcite and references therein , and also the comments at the end of sect .",
    "[ conc_sec ] .",
    "it should be noted that the probability of capture will be affected by the choice of dissipation model .",
    "the algorithm to solve  ( [ ode ] ) that we propose in this paper is essentially the usual euler method , extended so that the series solution is computed to @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the timestep and @xmath23 .",
    "that is , we advance a solution by one timestep via the truncated taylor expansion @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and the functions @xmath27 can be computed explicitly from the differential equation , which allows one to compute , recursively , the derivatives of @xmath28 and @xmath29 of all orders at @xmath30 , in terms of the initial conditions , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "the standard euler method can be recovered by setting @xmath33 .    with a judicious choice of @xmath34 and @xmath35 ,",
    "we demonstrate that for our problem , one can use  ( [ eul ] ) to compute solutions to the ode in relatively large , equal timesteps .",
    "furthermore , the size of the timestep used is fixed throughout , so the algorithm is not even adaptive .",
    "such an approach might be thought to be of limited practical use , but it is one purpose of this paper to show that , for some problems , this is not the case . in particular , the computational cost of solving an ode using the proposed method turns out to be lower than all other algorithms against which it was compared .",
    "we draw a parallel here between this work and that of , for instance ,  @xcite , in which a series approach is also used to solve odes .",
    "there are however important differences between the approach of chang and corliss and ours : first , the series used by them are computed , numerically , at each timestep ; and second , they use appropriate variations on the standard ratio test for convergence , to estimate the size of each timestep  so their method is adaptive .",
    "by contrast , in this work , the timesteps are fixed and all series required are pre - computed and stored : this approach can significantly speed up the algorithm by reducing the computational overheads .",
    "both methods are , however , essentially numerical analytical continuation .    in setting up our algorithm , we use computer algebra ( ca ) to generate code in a low - level language ( ll ) , once only for each set of parameters , which computes the functions appearing on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eul ] ) .",
    "this ll code is in turn compiled and executed in order to produce results .",
    "it might be thought that the ll step can be omitted , and the ca program can be used to carry out the whole task .",
    "it can ; this approach would lead to a significant decrease in speed however , since ca software is generally designed for algebraic manipulation and is not optimised for numerical computation . as an example , consider the sum @xmath36 whose evaluation requires @xmath37 addition and @xmath38 multiplication / division operations , and which we use later for timing purposes .",
    ": it happens to be the case that the evaluation of @xmath39 takes 1 second of cpu time on the computer used to do most of the computations in this paper . of course , simply by timing the evaluation of @xmath39 on another computer , one can scale times given in this paper to correspond to times for that computer . ]",
    "the obvious experiment shows that numerical evaluation of @xmath40 , for @xmath41 , say , @xmath42 , using 17 significant figures , takes about 260 times longer using ca compared with ll .",
    "this increase in speed comes at a cost however : standard ll codes using in - built mathematical operations , although relatively fast , will always carry out arithmetic to fixed precision  double precision is standard , which equates to about 1617 s.f . on the other hand , ca can in principle be used to evaluate numerical expressions to any specified precision , the upper limit being set only by memory and time constraints .",
    "this implied trade - off between accuracy and speed guides us in setting up the algorithm in practice .",
    "the compromise we have to make is encapsulated in :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ find the smallest integer @xmath34 and the largest fixed timestep @xmath22 , such that the pair of power series of degree @xmath34 , which advance the solution @xmath43 of  ( [ ode ] ) from @xmath44 to @xmath45 , using  ( [ eul ] ) , for all @xmath46 , both do so to within a given tolerance .",

    "since the ode  ( [ ode ] ) is nonlinear , so is the recursion formula , and the closed - form expressions for @xmath73 , as polynomials in the six arguments , quickly become large as @xmath74 increases .",

    "then to first order we obtain @xmath176 which , after integration , gives @xmath177 where @xmath178 provided that @xmath179 is fixed so as to satisfy @xmath180      to second order ( [ eq:3.2 ] ) becomes @xmath181 by using ( [ eq:2.9 ] ) and ( [ eq:3.4 ] ) we can write in ( [ eq:3.6 ] ) @xmath182 then , writing @xmath183 we find @xmath184 and hence in  ( [ eq:3.6 ] ) @xmath185 furthermore in  ( [ eq:3.6 ] ) @xmath186 where ( [ eq:3.4 ] ) has been used .",
    "the coefficient @xmath187 in ( [ eq:3.6 ] ) has to be fixed so as to cancel out any term linear in @xmath188 produced by the @xmath189-integration , if such a term exists .",
    "since there is no such term , we set @xmath190 . therefore , if we also set @xmath191 we obtain @xmath192 where we have defined @xmath193      to third order we have @xmath194 where once more @xmath195 has to be fixed in such a way that the @xmath189-integration does not produce any term linear in @xmath188 .",
    "if we only want to determine @xmath196 to second order , then we do not need to compute @xmath197  which would be needed to compute @xmath198  and we have only to single out the terms linear in @xmath188 arising from @xmath199 where we have also used the fact that no term linear in @xmath188 is produced by the integration of @xmath200 .",
    "we have in  ( [ eq:3.9 ] ) @xmath201 where both ( [ eq:3.4 ] ) and ( [ eq:3.7 ] ) have been used .    if we use the trigonometric identities @xmath202 we realise immediately that only the second and sixth lines in ( [ eq:3.11 ] ) produce terms linear in @xmath188 after integration .",
    "indeed one has in  ( [ eq:3.11 ] ) @xmath203 so that the term with @xmath204 in the second sum in  ( [ eq:3.11bis ] ) gives @xmath205 and , analogously , in  ( [ eq:3.11 ] ) , one has @xmath206 so that the term with @xmath204 in the first sum in  ( [ eq:3.12bis ] ) gives @xmath207 by collecting together the contributions ( [ eq:3.12 ] ) and ( [ eq:3.13 ] ) with that arising from the term in @xmath195 in ( [ eq:3.9 ] ) , we find @xmath208 by ( [ eq:3.8 ] ) we have @xmath209 so that one has to fix @xmath210 an explicit computation gives , in the case of mercury , @xmath211 and , in the case of the moon , @xmath212 .      by requiring @xmath213 to satisfy a diophantine condition such as @xmath214 where @xmath215 and @xmath216 are integers , and with @xmath217 and @xmath218 , the analysis can be pushed to any perturbation order .",
    "the series for @xmath219 can then be proved to converge to a function @xmath220 depending analytically on @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , this has been proved in @xcite  it could also be proved directly , by using diagrammatic techniques ( see for instance  @xcite for a review ) to show that , to any perturbation order @xmath221 , the functions @xmath222 and the coefficients @xmath223 are bounded above proportionally to a constant to the power @xmath221 . moreover ,",
    "both the solution ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) and the function @xmath219 are not smooth in @xmath164 : in fact they are defined on a cantor set @xmath224 . however , the function admits a whitney extension @xcite to a @xmath225 function , so that one can consider the implicit function problem @xmath226 such an equation admits a solution @xmath227 so that , if for a fixed @xmath8 the corresponding @xmath164 is diophantine , then we have a quasi - periodic attractor of the form ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) .    for @xmath228 and @xmath165 diophantine , the set of values @xmath229 $ ] such that @xmath164 is diophantine has full measure in @xmath230 $ ] .",
    "however the convergence of the series requires for @xmath231 to be small , so that the set of values of @xmath8 for which the quasi - periodic attractor exists has large , but not full measure .",
    "so , for fixed @xmath165 , it is a non - trivial problem to understand whether a smooth quasi - periodic attractor can exist .",
    "indeed , for fixed @xmath165 and @xmath8 one has first to compute the solution @xmath213 to the implicit equation ( [ eq:3.16 ] ) and then to check whether such a solution satisfies the diophantine condition ( [ eq:3.15 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath232 , double precision arithmetic is inadequate to estimate @xmath233 : in this case , we are after all attempting to find a difference of order @xmath234 between two numbers , @xmath165 and @xmath164 , both of order unity .",
    "furthermore , this difference can only be estimated by iterating many times a ( hem - approximated ) poincar map , in which the error per iteration is @xmath235 .",
    "in fact , we estimate @xmath236 using double precision arithmetic and @xmath237 iterations . thus , use of a higher - accuracy computation is indicated .",
    "we therefore use a hem with @xmath238 , for which the maximum value of @xmath239 when we iterate it using ca with 35 significant figures .",
    "since this accurate ca implementation is about 8000 times slower that the equivalent ll computation , we reduce the number of iterations @xmath41 to @xmath42 in equation  ( [ omp_comp ] ) .",
    "also , convergence to @xmath164 is quite slow , so we extrapolate to estimate the limit as @xmath240 .    in order to illustrate this convergence and extrapolation",
    ", we include fig .",
    "[ interp ] , which is a plot of @xmath241/(2\\pi i b)$ ] against @xmath74 with @xmath242 . superimposed on the plot",
    "are the peak and trough values , shown as filled circles , and a least squares fit curve ( dashed line ) through just these values .",
    "the curve is of the form @xmath243 and for the peak values , @xmath244 ; for the trough values , @xmath245",
    ". we therefore estimate @xmath246 for @xmath232 . this value should be compared with that given by perturbation theory , which is @xmath247 .    ,",

    "we start by expanding the sine terms in @xmath249 in equation  ( [ gdef ] ) in the spin - orbit ode to obtain @xmath250 -\\gamma\\alpha\\left(y - \\omega\\right ) \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath251 are fourier polynomials in @xmath48 .",

    "we refer to this as the fourier series form .",
    "the point we wish to make here is that the @xmath143-th coefficient in the expansion of @xmath255 in this form always has a factor of @xmath119 .",
    "that is not to say that , for small @xmath8 , the fourier coefficients themselves decrease exponentially with increasing @xmath143 , because we do not prove that @xmath254 grow more slowly than exponentially .    to show that @xmath255 can be written in the form  ( [ eff ] ) , we start with the taylor series expansion @xmath256 where @xmath257 is the @xmath74-th derivative of @xmath258 at @xmath259 .",
    "using the fact that the ode  ( [ ode_spec ] ) supplies us with a means for substituting for the first  and hence , recursively , for all  derivatives of @xmath93 , then @xmath260 can be written as a sum of terms each of which is a product of the form @xmath261 where @xmath262 is a numerical constant ; @xmath263 is a combination of @xmath264 and @xmath265 and their derivatives ; integer @xmath266 ; @xmath267 ; and @xmath268 .",
    "we wish to prove that all terms have a factor of @xmath269 , so that we can always write @xmath270 , where @xmath271 is another constant ; from this , equation  ( [ eff ] ) will follow .",
    "differentiating @xmath272 with respect to @xmath48 , we obtain @xmath276 +   k py^{k-1}\\dot{y }",
    "c^{d - l } s^l.\\ ] ] as it stands , this expression consists of four terms each of degree @xmath273 , but using  ( [ ode_spec ] ) to replace @xmath277 , the last term becomes @xmath278c^{d - l } s^l =   -{\\varepsilon}kpy^{k-1}\\left[a c^{d - l+1}s^l + b c^{d - l } s^{l+1}\\right ] + kp y^{k-1}\\gamma\\alpha(-y+\\omega)c^{d - l } s^l.\\ ] ] this expression consists of two terms of degree @xmath279 , both of which are multiplied by @xmath8 , and two terms of degree @xmath273 , neither of which are multiplied by @xmath8 .",
    "hence , differentiation of a term of degree @xmath273 , followed by substitution of @xmath277 , if present , leads to an expression of the form @xmath280 + [ \\mbox{sum of terms of degree $ d$}]$ ] . since differentiation and substitution are the only processes by which @xmath281 is generated , by induction all terms in @xmath281 of degree @xmath273 have a factor of @xmath269 .",
    "furthermore , any expression @xmath282 is equal to a sum of terms of the form @xmath283 , @xmath284 , with @xmath285 ; and from this , the form  ( [ eff ] ) follows .      ,",
