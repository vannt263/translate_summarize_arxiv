    "it is well - known that the distribution of the atomic hydrogen gas ( hi ) in many spiral galaxies is non - axisymmetric or lopsided .",
    "this lopsidedness was first studied by baldwin , lynden - bell , & sancisi ( 1980 ) . from the analysis of global profiles of hi using single dish radio telescopes",
    ", it was concluded that over 50 % of galaxies studied show such asymmetry ( richter & sancisi 1994 , haynes et al .",
    "1998 , matthews , van driel , & gallagher 1998 ) . due to the lack of spatial resolution",
    ", such studies could only reveal the combined effect of spatial and velocity asymmetry .",
    "the lopsidedness has also been observed kinematically , as in terms of asymmetric rotation curves ( swaters et al .",
    "1999 ) which can be directly used to obtain the lopsided perturbation potential ( jog 2002 ) .",
    "the kinematical asymmetry has been used to deduce the ellipticity of the potential from the analysis of the hi velocity fields ( franx , van gorkom , & de zeeuw 1994 ; schoenmakers et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "many theories have been proposed for the observed lopsidedness .",
    "they include tidal interactions ( jog 1997 ) , minor mergers @xcite , asymmetric gas accretion @xcite , and offset stellar disc in the halo potential @xcite .",
    "it is not yet clear which of these possible scenarios work at scales of a galactic group .",
    "recently , in a first such study , the 2-d spatial distribution of hi was fourier - analysed to measure the lopsidedness for a sample of 18 galaxies in the eridanus group of galaxies ( angiras et al .",
    "2006 , here onwards called paper i ) . in this paper",
    ", it was found that the mean amplitude of measured lopsidedness is large @xmath4 ( i.e. , a surface density contrast of 20% above an uniform disc ) , nearly twice of that seen in the stellar component of the field galaxies ( rix & zaritsky 1995 , bournaud et al .",
    "also , it was shown that the early - type spiral galaxies show a higher lopsidedness than the late - type spirals , which is contrary to that observed in field galaxies ( bournaud et al . 2005 ) .",
    "these two results suggest that tidal interactions play a dominant role in the generation of lopsidedness in the galaxies in groups , as was argued in paper i. it is not known whether these results are common to all group environments , especially since the groups are known to exhibit a large variety of properties @xcite , especially regarding the galaxy density and velocity dispersions .    here",
    "we address this issue by analysing the 2-d hi data for galaxies in the ursa major group .",
    "the velocity dispersion , the fraction of early type galaxies and the lack of hi deficiency @xcite are the major differences between the ursa major and the eridanus groups . thus the galaxies in the ursa major group provide an opportunity to study lopsidedness in a different physical environment .",
    "we have selected 11 spiral galaxies belonging to the ursa major group for estimating the spatial lopsidedness and elongation .",
    "the spatial lopsidedness values are compared with the results of the eridanus group of galaxies ( paper i ) to see whether group environments give rise to similar values for the amplitudes and phases of the spatial asymmetries .",
    "the higher order fourier components ( m=1,2,3 ) have also been obtained .",
    "further , we have carried out an analysis of the kinematical data to estimate the elongation in the potential .",
    "this is compared with the values obtained from the spatial analysis.as in the eridanus case ( paper i ) , the use of hi as a tracer allows us to study lopsidedness to outer disks covering a radial distance larger than twice that studied earlier using the near - ir data on stars as in rix & zaritsky ( 1995 ) and bournaud et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the hi and optical data used for the proposed analysis .",
    "details of the harmonic analysis , and the results are presented in section 3 .",
    "a discussion of these results in the context of the group environment is given in section 4 and in section 5 we give the conclusions .",
    "the ursa major group in the super galactic co - ordinate system lies between @xmath5 degrees and @xmath6 degrees @xcite .",
    "the systemic velocity of this group is @xmath7 km s@xmath8 with a dispersion of @xmath9 km s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "seventy nine galaxies have been associated with this group @xcite and this group had a projected density of 3 galaxies per mpc@xmath10 . due to the small velocity dispersion , it is not yet clear whether it can be classified as a cluster as mentioned in tully et al.(1996 ) . in addition",
    "this group contains a smaller fraction of early - type galaxies ( @xmath11 ( e+s0 ) and a larger fraction of late - type galaxies @xmath12 ( sp+irr)@xcite ) this system does not show a central concentration @xcite which is atypical for a cluster and more similar to that found in a group .    as we shall be using the results from a similar analysis carried out on eridanus group by angiras et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in section 3&4 , a brief summary of the characteristics of this group is given .",
    "this group in super - galactic co - ordinate system lies between @xmath13 degrees and @xmath14 degrees at a mean distance of @xmath15mpc .",
    "approximately 200 galaxies are associated with this group with a velocity dispersion of @xmath16kms@xmath8 . in this case",
    "the projected density was higher , @xmath17 8 galaxies per mpc@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "unlike ursa major , in eridanus group there was a larger fraction of elliptical and s0 type galaxies ( @xmath18 ( e+s0 ) and a smaller fraction of the late - type galaxies @xmath19 ( sp+irr ) @xcite ) . in this case also , like ursa major , the group centre is not known .",
    "the selection criteria for the 18 galaxies that were used for the harmonic analysis by angiras et al .",
    "( 2006 ) are similar to what is given in section 2.2 ( paragraph 1 ) .",
    "even though , these two groups are almost at the same distance from us they differ mainly in two aspects .",
    "firstly , in eridanus group , hi deficiency is seen which is ascribed to tidal interactions @xcite .",
    "hi deficiency is not seen in the case of ursa major @xcite .",
    "secondly , compared to eridanus , ursa major is a loose group @xcite .    the higher number density and the higher velocity dispersion as seen in the eridanus group implies a higher rate of tidal interactions between the galaxies in the group .",
    "also , the higher fraction of early - type galaxies seen in the eridanus represent an earlier evolution of galaxies via tidal interactions .",
    "these agree with the higher amplitude of lopsidedness seen in the eridanus galaxies , if generated by tidal interactions .",
    "we caution , however , that the spatial distribution of the ursa major galaxies is that of an elongated filament @xcite .",
    "hence , it may not be so straightforward to calculate the dependence of the galaxy interaction rate on the number density in that case .",
    "out of the 49 galaxies observed using the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) by verheijen and sancisi ( 2001 ) , we have selected 11 galaxies on the basis of their inclination and quality of hi maps ( galaxies , whose hi maps were patchy were rejected ) for further analysis .",
    "the right ascension ( @xmath20 ) , declination ( @xmath21 ) , systemic velocity ( @xmath22 ) , inclination ( @xmath23 ) and position angle ( pa ) of these galaxies are given in table 1 .",
    "all the galaxies selected were in the inclination range of 45 to 70 degrees .",
    "this was to ensure the availability of good resolution in velocity maps and hi maps , both of which were essential for the analysis @xcite .",
    "details of the observation and the preliminary data reduction are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,>,>,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "1 .   the ursa major group of galaxies show a typical lopsidedness of @xmath24 in the inner regions , that is comparable to the field case , and about half of what is seen in the eridanus group ( see section 3.1.1 for details ) .",
    "+ we also measure the @xmath25 values in the outer parts between 1 - 2 @xmath26 , and find this to be @xmath27 .",
    "again this is smaller by a factor of @xmath28 compared to the eridanus case .",
    "we plot the mean @xmath25 ( @xmath29 ) value in the inner regions of the galaxies with respect to hubble type in figure 7 , where we also plot the corresponding values from the eridanus study for comparison ( paper i , figure 5 ) .",
    "note that the early - type galaxies in the eridanus group show a higher lopsidedness , this is opposite to what is seen in the field galaxies @xcite , and points to tidal interactions as the mechanism for the origin of lopsidedness as argued in paper i. in contrast , in field galaxies , gas accretion plays an important role in generating lopsidedness @xcite . the anti - correlation with galaxy",
    "hubble type is weaker in the ursa group case , perhaps because our sample here only covers a smaller subgroup of galaxy types from type 4 to 7 , whereas the eridanus study spans a much larger range from type 1 to 9 .",
    "+ to address this issue , we obtained the r - band images of three more galaxies from the ursa major sample @xcite , namely ugc 6930 , ngc 4102 and ngc 3729 , from the canadian astronomy data centre ( cadc ) on which fourier analysis was carried out .",
    "ugc 6930 belonged to hubble type 7 and had an inclination of 32@xmath30 .",
    "ngc 4102 and ngc 3729 belonged to hubble type 2 and had inclinations 58@xmath30 and 48@xmath30 respectively .",
    "the a@xmath0 coefficient in the range 1.5 to 2.5 @xmath31 for ugc 6930 was estimated to be 0.02 . in the same range ,",
    "the a@xmath0 coefficients for ngc 4102 and ngc3729 were 0.12 and 0.04 respectively .",
    "these galaxies were not included in our hi analysis because of lack of reliable hi data .",
    "it should be noted that if these three points are included in ks - test , the probability that the values of a@xmath0 come from the same distribution is @xmath32 while the maximum difference ( d ) between the cumulative distribution is 0.357 .",
    "the three resulting points are shown in fig . 7 ( denoted by symbol ) and",
    "they confirm that the distribution of a@xmath0 vs. r is nearly flat .",
    "thus there is no clear anti - correlation in this case unlike that seen in the eridanus group .",
    "however , this distribution does not show a positive correlation with the hubble type either , unlike the field case @xcite .",
    "+ thus figure 7 confirms the different physical origins for the lopsidedness in the group and field cases .",
    "it also confirms that the anti - correlation seen in the eridanus group can be attributed to the group environment , and requires a higher galaxy number density as seen in the eridanus to be effective .",
    "3 .   the kinematical analysis gives a value for the elongation in the potential , showing all galaxies where such analysis could be carried out to be disturbed .",
    "this was found earlier for a group of five galaxies in the sculptor group galaxies ( schoenmakers 2000 ) .",
    "the above results show that the group environment is conducive to producing lopsidedness , with tidal interactions playing a major role in this .",
    "galaxy interactions can give rise both to lopsidedness and a secular evolution towards early - type galaxies as argued by bournaud et al .",
    "there are indeed some indications of tidal interactions in ursa major group of galaxies ( verheijen & sancisi 2001 ) .",
    "the ursa major group is a loose group , and has number density that is intermediate between the field and the eridanus values .",
    "hence tidal interactions are less important in the ursa major group , which could explain the lower amplitude of lopsidedness ( a@xmath0 ) .",
    "the lower values of asymmetry parameter ( @xmath29 ) observed for ursa major group of galaxies may also find a partial explanation , if we assume that it mainly falls on a filament and is in the process of forming a group .",
    "such a process is observed in zwcl 2341.1 + 0000 @xcite .",
    "the main conclusions drawn from this paper are as follows :    1 .   the mean amplitude of disk lopsidedness in the ursa major group galaxies is measured and found to be comparable to the field sample , while the eridanus group showed a factor of two higher lopsidedness .",
    "+ the smaller amplitudes of lopsidedness seen in the present study could be due to the lower galaxy number density and the lower velocity dispersion in the ursa major group ( see section 2 ) . the group environment and tidal interactions",
    "are shown to play a major role in generating lopsidedness , especially in a denser group like the eridanus .",
    "+ the disk lopsidedness can thus be used as diagnostics to study the galaxy interactions and the halo properties in groups of galaxies .",
    "the values of elongation of potential as measured from spatial and kinematical studies gives comparable values , thus supporting the idea ( jog 1997 ) that both types of asymmetry arise due to the same perturbation potential .",
    "the values of the asymmetry as measured by the mean fractional fourier amplitudes a@xmath0 , a@xmath33 and a@xmath34 are found to be comparable , and also the derived perturbation potential parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are found to be comparable .",
    "this is in contrast to the field galaxies where a@xmath0 and a@xmath33 are stronger than a@xmath34 and higher mode amplitudes .",
    "this indicates the importance of multiple tidal interactions that can occur under the special conditions of a group environment .",
    "we thank the referee , frederic bournaud , for a careful reading of the manuscript and for the critical comments and the suggestion of including the a@xmath0 values from r - band images in figure 7 .",
    "these have improved the presentation of the paper .",
    "raa takes great pleasure in thanking k. indulekha , school of pure and applied physics , m.g.university,for her constant encouragement during this project .",
    "he also thanks the university grants commission of india and st.josephs college , bangalore for granting study leave under the fip leave of 10th five year plan and raman research institute , bangalore for providing all the facilities to pursue this study.this research used the facilities of the canadian astronomy data centre operated by the national research council of canada with the support of the canadian space agency .",
