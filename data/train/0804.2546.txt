    "two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) are widely investigated due to their intriguing non - bulk like properties and their possible applications @xcite .",
    "one example of interest is the oscillating behavior of their thermodynamic properties with respect to a strong perpendicular magnetic field @xmath0 at low temperature @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this general trend is attributed to the presence of landau levels  the discretized energy spectrum of a 2des subject to a strong magnetic field applied normal to the 2d plane @xcite .",
    "landau levels are represented in the density of energy states ( dos ) of a non - interacting 2des as a series of dirac - delta functions with gaps that are empty of electronic states @xcite .",
    "on the side of theoretical investigations , earlier studies have obtained landau level broadening , in the extreme quantum limit , when self - consistent treatment of electron - impurity scattering is taken into account @xcite .",
    "another work , employing perturbative treatment of disorder and coulomb interaction , obtained a dos with sharp edges in the limit where landau level mixing is ignored @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , reports on the dos extracted from experiments indicate broadened landau levels .",
    "this is true whether the dos is inferred from magnetization @xcite , heat capacity @xcite or capacitance measurements @xcite .",
    "moreover , depending on the applied magnetic field strength , overlaps of landau levels may occur which indicate existence of electronic states in between the ideal dos peaks .",
    "these overlaps have been analytically confirmed in the presence of a weak disorder @xcite . but this derivation has no localization effects and it contains parameters related to the impurity configuration , namely , its density and distance from the 2des plane .",
    "such conditions make quantitative comparison with experimental results difficult .",
    "others resorted to phenomenological calculations employing either of these dos shapes : gaussian @xcite , lorentzian @xcite , exponential @xcite or gaussian with a background @xcite .",
    "these depend on a single broadening parameter @xmath2 , which according to the short range model is inversely proportional to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "several researchers have made data fits to obtain the dos using this @xmath0 dependence on @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , the dos obtained using @xmath4 is found to be four times smaller than measurements in 2des in gaas / algaas heterostructures @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the landau level widths are predicted to oscillate due to the fluctuations in the screening of the disorder by the electrons in the 2des @xcite .",
    "experimental data from multiple - quantum - well structures are consistent with a @xmath2 oscillating as a function of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "although there is yet no consensus on the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath2 , it is still advantageous to use a broadening parameter as it contains all the collective temperature- and magnetic field - dependence of the 2des .",
    "this then makes comparison with experimental data of macroscopic properties easier .    despite the lack of a complete theory for",
    "the landau level broadening caused by impurity disorder , information on the effects of the broadening on the thermodynamic quantities will provide further insights on the scattering mechanisms present . in this work",
    ", the behavior of the specific heat and the magnetization as functions of @xmath2 and @xmath1 is obtained through a phenomenological approach . here a gaussian - shaped dos is employed .",
    "this form is utilized since it is a commonly used model for experimental data and has been found to fit better than other semi - elliptical functions and long - ranged models @xcite . using various broadening parameters , the above mentioned physical quantities",
    "are calculated for a single sub - band in temperatures in the order of 0.3 k to 4.2 k and magnetic fields in the order of 0.5 t to 15 t.",
    "the specific heat capacity @xmath6 and the magnetization @xmath7 of two - dimensional electron systems are both functions of the magnetic field @xmath0 and temperature @xmath1 .",

    "the behavior of these magneto - thermodynamic properties can be determined once the chemical potential and the density of states are known .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath17 can be obtained via a root - finding method for a fixed value of @xmath16 .",
    "this condition is not a problem since experiments on 2des usually keep @xmath16 constant . for a given @xmath1 and @xmath0 , the value of @xmath17",
    "is sought that provides the least percentage error of not more than @xmath18 from the set value of the electron concentration in @xmath19 in this work , @xmath16 is set equal to @xmath20 .",
    "this value is chosen to be of the same order of magnitude of high mobility 2des samples as found in experimental reports @xcite .",
    "a number of experiments support a gaussian density of states @xmath12 model for two - dimensional electron systems @xcite .",

    "the effective mass @xmath29 used here is that of carriers in a gaas / algaas heterostructure which is equal to @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the mass of the electron .",
    "some experimental data fits use eq .",
    "( [ eq : gaussiandos ] ) with an additional constant background obtained from a fraction of the zero - field dos @xcite .",
    "this fraction provides an adjustable parameter dependent on experimental factors .",
    "however , depending on @xmath0 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gaussiandos ] ) is found to produce gaussian peaks with overlap between landau levels .",
    "this overlap acts as a sort of a uniform background .",
    "therefore , there is no need to introduce an additional term to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gaussiandos ] ) .    in our simulations ,",
    "we investigate the case when the broadening parameter @xmath2 is set to ( i ) fixed values , ( ii ) a function of @xmath32 where @xmath33 mev / t@xmath34 , and ( iii ) an oscillating function of the filling factor @xmath35 similar to ref .",

    "for constant @xmath2 , only the results for @xmath38 mev and @xmath39 mev will be shown .",
    "in the absence of landau level broadening , the chemical potential exhibits oscillations as a function of @xmath0 with sharp peaks occuring at even filling factors @xmath35 . since the last occupied landau level is fullly filled for even @xmath35 , this implies that one needs to go to the next higher level to add one more electron . on the contrary",
    ", an odd @xmath35 corresponds to a last occupied level filled to half its degeneracy .",
    "adding an electron will not change @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , at odd @xmath35 the chemical potential is a constant .",
    "the sharp oscillations of @xmath40 are reduced and softened upon the introduction of broadening as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu ] for @xmath41 k at @xmath42 mev .",
    "a similar effect was observed in 2des in quantum wells for multiple sub - band occupation @xcite .",
    "note , however , that despite the presence of broadening , @xmath17 approaches its ideal behavior of having sharp peaks at @xmath43 k.    the landau level broadening is reflected in the specific heat in fig .",
    "[ fig : sphtgamma ] as spikes at the low field region . at @xmath44",
    ", the narrow peaks occur at magnetic fields when the chemical potential crosses from one landau level to the next .",
    "these crossings are known as interlevel excitations @xcite . as @xmath0 increases ,",
    "the landau levels are farther apart and it becomes more difficult to have interlevel excitations .",
    "this is reflected in the diminishing peak heights of @xmath6 at @xmath45 and @xmath46 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sphtgamma ] . until",
    "finally , @xmath6 vanishes at @xmath47 .",
    "this is comparable with the results in ref .",
    "@xcite where interlevel excitations appear as small structures near the minima in the @xmath6 oscillations at high @xmath0 .    at high @xmath0 ( @xmath48 ) , landau levels are far apart and the degree of degeneracy within a broadened level is high .",
    "excitations brought about by an increase in @xmath0 are limited within the last occupied level . in this @xmath0 region",
    "the intralevel contributions dominate @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath6 exhibits a wide peak at @xmath49 .",
    "this general trend of competing dominance between interlevel and intralevel contributions of @xmath6 with @xmath0 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : sphtgamma ] is conserved regardless of the broadening parameter used .",
    "an increase in magnitude of the constant @xmath2 appears in @xmath6 as widening of the interlevel contributions and narrowing of the intralevel excitations .",
    "the latter is easily observed in the region @xmath49 wherein the change of @xmath6 has a slower slope with @xmath0 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that a wider landau level corresponds to a slower variation of the dos with energy .",
    "when @xmath2 oscillates with @xmath0 one obtains a similar trend for @xmath6 except for slight variations in the region where intralevel contributions dominate .",
    "although not shown here , the @xmath6 result for @xmath50 coincides with the result for @xmath42 mev at @xmath41 k.    the influence of the temperature on the specific heat as @xmath51 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : spht2 t ] . for clarity",
    ", we will only show here the result for @xmath41 k and @xmath43 k. reducing @xmath1 from 4.2 k minimizes the interlevel contributions and , consequently , the magnitude of the sharp peaks at @xmath52 t diminishes . until at @xmath43",
    "k , the effect of @xmath2 vanishes .",
    "this shows that despite the presence of broadened landau levels excitations between them are no longer possible .",
    "only intralevel excitations contribute to @xmath6 which is a characteristic of an ideal 2des . at even @xmath35 , where @xmath53 for @xmath42 mev , @xmath6 changes from a maximum when @xmath41k to a minimum when @xmath43 k. this crossover is likewise found here for @xmath54 mev at @xmath55 and in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case when @xmath56 .",
    "the corresponding influence of @xmath1 on @xmath7 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mag ] .",
    "orbital magnetization in 2des with electron - impurity scattering do not have sharp spikes with @xmath0 according to a self - consistent theory @xcite .",
    "moreover , experimental evidence of the de haas - van alphen effect displays rounding at the extrema of the @xmath7 oscillations which are attributed to finite temperature and to having no states in the energy gaps @xcite .",
    "the numerical calculations presented herein , likewise , observe these rounding of @xmath7 oscillations at @xmath41 k. similar to the experimental results @xcite , the amplitude of the @xmath7 oscillations approaches the ideal saw - tooth behavior with respect to @xmath0 at @xmath43 k. the important result here is that these sharp oscillations are observed regardless of the form of the broadening , even as large as @xmath54 mev where there are significant amount of states in between landau levels .",
    "the temperature behavior of @xmath6 corresponding to different fractional filling factors is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaled ] . a peak is observed at @xmath57 k. this characteristic temperature signifies the shift from an ideal 2des behavior to the regime where interlevel excitations and the landau level broadening are felt .",
    "below @xmath58 , @xmath6 has a linear @xmath1-dependence reminiscent of the bulk electron gas behavior @xcite . right above @xmath58 ,",
    "@xmath6 decays since the intralevel contributions decrease with @xmath1 for a given @xmath0 .",
    "a similar peak was observed in ref .",
    "but they did not observe a uniform peak since their landau level broadening has a non - monotonic dependence with @xmath0 and @xmath16 .",
    "consequently , their dos may overlap below the fermi energy and have large excitation gaps beyond .",
    "the work presented here does not include spin splitting .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that , when spin textures are present , @xmath6 peak shifts to higher @xmath1 with the land @xmath59 factor for a given fractional @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the same characteristic temperature is observed regardless of the filling factor and the location of the chemical potential in the dos .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath6 curves for the fractional @xmath35 coincide if one scales the specific heat with respect to the filling factor as shown in the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : scaled ] .",
    "this @xmath6 behavior having a peak at @xmath58 is also observed at integer @xmath35 . however , they do not follow this scaling behavior since at odd @xmath35 , the chemical potential is a constant . at even @xmath35 ,",
    "the @xmath6 peak varies in magnitude depending on whether the interlevel contributions dominate or not .",
    "the effect of landau level broadening and temperature is considered in two - dimensional electron systems using a gaussian - shaped density of states .",
    "the broadening parameters considered took different forms such as different constant values , a square - root dependence on the magnetic field and an oscillating function with respect to the filling factor .",
    "the observed @xmath0 behavior of the chemical potential , specific heat and magnetization show the same trend regardless of the form of @xmath2 .",
    "the broadening only plays a role in the width of the oscillations with @xmath0 for each interlevel and intralevel contribution .",
    "a characteristic temperature is observed such that the 2des approaches its ideal electron gas behavior .",
    "below this characteristic temperature , the landau level broadening no longer affects the behavior of the thermodynamics properties .",
    "this indicates that scattering mechanisms present in 2des are suppressed below @xmath58 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath58 is obtained here using the electron concentration and effective mass value for a gaas system .",
    "it would be interesting to know if experiments are able to measure @xmath58 . if not , this should be a ground for theoretical studies to find out why @xmath58 is masked in experiments .",
