    "the description of deuteron properties and reactions involving the deuteron is reflected in a large part of arenhvel s work . relaying also on his analyzes  @xcite of experimental data the discussion of relativistic issues in reactions involving the deuteron has become more and more important in recent years .",
    "there are well known examples of clear experimental evidence , in particular in the electromagnetic disintegration of the deuteron  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile two relativistic approaches to the nucleon nucleon system have received special attention in the last few years .",
    "one is based on the bethe - salpeter equation  @xcite and its various three - dimensional reductions .",
    "based on quantum field theory the bethe - salpeter formalism is four - dimensional and explicitly lorentz covariant .",
    "interactions ( e.g. electromagnetic currents ) are consistently treated via the mandelstam formalism leading to feynman diagrams and the corresponding rules .",
    "the second approach considered here is based on light front dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the state vector describing the system is expanded in fock components defined on a hypershere in the four - dimensional space time .",
    "this approach is intuitively appealing since it is formally close to the nonrelativistic conception in terms of hamiltonians , and state vectors maybe directly interpreted as wave functions .",
    "the equivalence between these field theoretic and light front approaches has been a subject of recent discussions , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "a comparison of both approaches for the deuteron as a two body system clarifies the structure of the different components of the amplitude .",
    "it is also useful in the context of three particle dynamics where the proper covariant and/or light front construction of the nucleon amplitude in terms of three valence quarks ( including spin dependence and configuration mixing ) is presently discussed  @xcite .",
    "although the relation between light front and bethe - salpeter amplitudes for the two nucleon amplitude has been spelled out to some extend in a recent report  @xcite we provide here some useful details and additionally discuss the use of the nakanishi representation .",
    "to proceed we first present different ways to construct a complete ( covariant ) bethe - salpeter amplitude , see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite . in particular , we consider the so called direct product and the matrix representation form .",
    "besides the spin structure of the wave function ( amplitudes ) we also present a comparison of the `` radial '' part of the amplitude on the basis of the nakanishi integral representation  @xcite . this integral representation ",
    "well known and elaborated for the scalar case , see , e.g. ref  @xcite , however , not so frequently used  allows us to establish a connection between the different approaches also for the weight functions ( or densities ) that has not been done so far and is relevant for a treatment of the bethe - salpeter equation in minkowski space .    in the following we present different ways to construct a complete ( covariant ) bethe - salpeter amplitude . in this context the so called direct product representation used in the rest frame of the nucleon nucleon system using",
    "the @xmath0-spin notation is close to the nonrelativistic coupling scheme and provides states of definite angular momentum . to construct the covariant basis this form",
    "is transformed into a matrix representation which will then be expressed in terms of dirac matrices .",
    "a generalization to arbitrary deuteron momenta finally leads to the covariant representation of the bethe - salpeter amplitude .",
    "this will be explained in the next section along with an explicit construction of the deuteron ( @xmath1 ) and the @xmath2 nucleon nucleon state .",
    "the construction of the light front form from the bethe - salpeter amplitude will be given in section  [ sect : lfbs ] .",
    "presentation of the light front approach will be kept concise here , since is has been presented at length in a recent report  @xcite .",
    "again we show the results for @xmath1 and @xmath2 deuteron and scattering states",
    ". finally , we present the analysis in terms of the nakanishi integral representation .",
    "commonly , two forms are utilized to describe the bethe - salpeter wave functions ( amplitudes ) known as direct product form and matrix form .",
    "they will be explained in the following .    for convenience ,",

    "e.g. since @xmath16 is parity odd , in the deuteron this combination could only appear for @xmath17 .",
    "therefore the appearance of @xmath18-states is a typical relativistic effect , because @xmath19 for the nonrelativistic limit .",

    "thus , the projection of the bethe - salpeter amplitudes to the light front reduces the number of independent functions to six instead of eight for the @xmath148 channel and to two instead of four for the @xmath62 channel . the reduction is because the nucleon momenta @xmath116 and @xmath117 are on - mass - shell in the light front formalism .",
    "the result is based on the application of the dirac equation and the use of the covariant form .",
    "any other representation ( e.g. spin orbital momentum basis ) also leads to a reduction of the number of amplitudes for the two nucleon wave function that is however less transparent . for an early consideration compare , e.g. ref .",
    "a deeper insight into the connection of bethe - salpeter amplitudes and light front wave functions will be provided within the integral representation proposed by nakanishi  @xcite .",

    "in fact the densities could be considered as the main object of the bethe - salpeter theory , because knowing them allows one to calculate all relevant amplitudes .    for the realistic deuteron",
    "we need to expand to nakanishi form to the spinor case , which has not been done so far .",
    "the key point to do so is choosing the proper spin - angular momentum functions and perform the integration over angles in the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "the choice of the covariant form of the amplitude allows us to establish a system of equations for the densities @xmath155 , suggesting the following general form for the radial functions @xmath73 ( even in @xmath156 ) @xmath157 for the functions that are odd in @xmath156 the whole integrand is multiplied by factor @xmath156 .",
    "although now the number of densities is larger the total number of _ independent _ functions is still eight .",
    "the form given in eq .",
    "( [ nak2 ] ) is valid only for the deuteron case .",
    "the continuum amplitudes of the @xmath62 state , e.g. , require a different form .",

    "e.g. @xmath162 reads @xmath163    note that the dependence of the amplitude on the light front argument @xmath164 is fully determined by the dependence of the density on the variable @xmath165 , which has also been noted in ref .",
    "@xcite for the wick - cutkosky model .",
    "this fully completes the connection between the bethe - salpeter amplitude and the light front form .",
    "evaluation of the nakanishi integrals does not lead to cancelations of functions .",
    "although some functions are cancelled for reasons given above all spin orbital momentum functions ( or all densities ) in principle contribute to the light front wave functions .",
    "once the bethe - salpeter amplitudes are given ( or the nakanishi densities ) the light front wave function can explicitly be calculated .",
    "the reduction of the number of amplitudes is due to @xmath116 and @xmath117 being on - shell in the light front form .",
    "the nakanishi spectral densities of the bethe - salpeter amplitudes lead directly to the light front wave function .",
    "even more than 60 years after its discovery the deuteron is still an object of intense research . in recent years",
    "the focus on relativistic aspects has increased , in particular in the context of @xmath166 scattering and relativistic @xmath167 reactions .",
    "meanwhile a relativistic description of the deuteron ( i.e. the nucleon nucleon system ) has achieved considerable progress .",

    "the covariant form has been given in terms of the partial wave representation using the @xmath0-spin notation .",
