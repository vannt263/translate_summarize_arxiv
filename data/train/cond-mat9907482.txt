    "one of the basic classification schemes for structural phase transitions consists in assigning it to the order - disorder or the displacive type .",
    "the displacive transition can be described as a freezing of a phonon mode , which shows `` critical softening '' at the phase transition point .",
    "the occurrence of a soft mode is often used as criterion for a displacive transition in a real systems , since the frequency of the phonon modes is accessible by spectroscopic experiments .    in the order - disorder case",
    ", there are two or more locations for each atom in the unit cell .",
    "occupation numbers for these locations are the same above the transition temperature , and differ below . formally , as in the displacive case , the system can be described in `` phonon '' language .",
    "there is a simple model which shows that one can go from the order - disorder to the displacive type _ continuously _ @xcite .",
    "this model can be defined as a 3d cubic lattice of classical anharmonic 1d oscillators with nearest - neighbour harmonic coupling @xcite :    @xmath8    @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are model parameters , the indices @xmath11 and @xmath12 run over all oscillators , @xmath13 is equal to 1 for neighbouring particles and vanishes elsewhere .",
    "the system undergoes a phase transition from the higher symmetry to the lower symmetry phase at a certain temperature @xmath3 for any @xmath14 , _ i.e. _ the statistical average of each coordinate @xmath15 takes a non - zero value @xmath16 below @xmath3 and vanishes above .",
    "it is often convenient to express the potential ( 1 ) as @xmath17 with an `` on - site '' single particle potential @xmath18 it is known that the behaviour of the system is governed by the ratio @xmath19    at small @xmath20 the system shows a displacive phase transition , while for large @xmath1 the system behaves as the ising model , which shows a typical order - disorder phase transition .",
    "the transition temperatures @xmath3 in the limit cases are known from ising - model and self - consistent phonon calculations , to be respectively @xcite :    @xmath21    assuming here and further that the temperature is expressed in energy units ( the boltzman constant equal to 1 ) . on the other hand , despite of the important role of the above model in the theory of the structural phase transitions @xcite , the actual dependence of @xmath22 is not known .",
    "the results of previous molecular dynamics and monte carlo studies are collected in figure 1 .",
    "they obviously do not give a consistent quantitative picture .",
    "so far the analytical study was restricted to the mean - field approach .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , it was observed that the knowledge of the dependence @xmath22 can be useful in the quantitative analysis of the properties of crystalline @xmath23 which has a ferroelectric phase transition showing simultaneously features typical for both the order - disorder and displacive type @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to establish this dependence of @xmath22 as well as the temperature behaviour of the order parameter .",
    "let us stress that , similarly to some related papers @xcite , we are not interested here in details of critical behaviour in the very vicinity of the phase transition .",
    "critical behaviour of this model is thoroughly described for example in the reference @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes our mc simulations performed for a wide range of values of the parameter @xmath1 . in section 3",
    ", we first compare the mc results with rather poor predictions of the standard decoupling schemes and suggest an improved self - consistent equation for the order parameter that allows to calculate both the transition temperature and the order parameter with a reasonable accuracy for all values of @xmath1 .",
    "for numerical simulation it is convenient to re - scale coordinates and energy units .",
    "this allows to reduce the potential energy ( [ e1 ] ) into the form @xmath24 with a single dimensionless parameter @xmath25 .",
    "then the re - scaled order parameter at zero temperature is equal to 1 for any @xmath20 .",
    "the typical size of the array of atoms studied in our mc simulations is @xmath26 atoms , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we perform monte - carlo steps consecutively for each atom , and accept ( or reject ) them accordingly to standard criteria . additionally , we perform `` magic '' steps for the case of large @xmath1 , when the sign of the coordinate of the given atom may flip .",
    "these steps allow the system to thermalize in the order - disorder limit as well .",
    "we calculate the square of the order parameter as the average @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the fourier transform of @xmath15 , @xmath29 is the total number of particles .    for the case of an infinite slab ,",
    "@xmath30 is negligible , and ( [ num ] ) gives purely the square of the order parameter . for a finite slab ,",
    "the term @xmath31 allows to remove fluctuations from the high - temperature branch .",
    "the results of the calculations are presented in figures 2 - 4 .",
    "it is crucial to check the dependence of the results on the system size .",
    "figure 2 presents the temperature dependence of @xmath32 for sizes @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "it is clear , that change of the size of the slab affects practically only the fluctuation region near @xmath3 .",
    "the value of @xmath3 calculated from the fit of the dependence ( see figure 2 ) remains almost unchanged .",
    "this type of size dependence of the data is found for the whole range of @xmath1 .",
    "figure 3 presents data for @xmath35 obtained for the potential ( [ e2 ] ) for different values of the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "note that the landau theory yields a linear temperature dependence for @xmath35 .",
    "values of @xmath3 are extracted from the data presented in figure 2 .",
    "the plot for @xmath22 is given in figure 4 where a logarithmic scale for the @xmath1-axis is used .",
    "the monotonic dependence approaches known limit values with a good accuracy .",
    "the change in @xmath1 is for which @xmath22 varies significantly is about 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "two standard decoupling schemes have been used in the literature to make the phase transition in the model tractable , usually referred to as mean field ( or independent site ) approximation and self - consistent phonon ( or independent mode ) approximation . in this section",
    "we first analyse the advantages and disadvantages of these standard approximations and then we propose a modified approximation scheme that combines advantages of both schemes .      in the independent mode approximation ( i m a ) , the deviations from the average value given by the order parameter @xmath36 are represented by fourier coordinates @xmath37 .",
    "interaction between fourier coordinates is simplified by assuming that each fourier coordinate is influenced only by the average of its interactions with the other coordinates .",
    "this leads to an effective harmonic approximation .",
    "the order parameter in i m a is defined by the equation @xcite @xmath38 where the function @xmath39 is calculated from the phonon dispersion relation renormalized by the given value of the order parameter and the thermal fluctuations . in the vicinity of the phase transition point , @xmath40 can be evaluated by assuming a `` critical '' phonon dispersion ( with zero frequency of the zone - center mode ) : @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "note that the stability limit @xmath43 of the high temperature phase as obtained from ( [ ew cond ] ) and ( [ i m a ] ) , provides an exact prediction for @xmath3 and @xmath44 in the displacive limit .",
    "however , for the order - disorder limit , the i m a values differ considerably from the exact values .      in the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) for the system with a harmonic coupling , the behaviour of the original system is modelled by an auxiliary system in which all direct inter - site interactions are replaced by an effective external field @xmath45 , but the on - site anharmonicity is kept without any approximation .",
    "taking the on - site potential as given by ( [ sitep ] ) , the ensemble averages in such an auxiliary system at fixed external field are given by @xmath46 d x}{\\int \\exp [ -(v(x)-ex)/t ] d x}. \\label{deff}\\ ] ] since at finite temperatures the @xmath47 is a monotonic function , it can be inverted and the self - consistent equation for the order parameter in the auxiliary system can be written as @xmath48 the effective field @xmath45 is defined as the force on @xmath15 supplied by the interaction terms separated in ( [ e2prime ] ) , assuming that the displacement of the six nearest neighbouring sites ( or at least their sum ) is frozen at the equilibrium value @xmath49 : @xmath50 self - consistent solution of equations ( [ mf eq],[mf eq1 ] ) defines the order parameter @xmath51 in mfa .",
    "the phase transition temperature @xmath52 at which @xmath51 vanishes is shown in figure 1 .",
    "it was previously remarked by s. aubry @xcite that the relative over - estimation of @xmath3 by mfa is almost the same ( about 30 percent ) for both limit cases ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "comparison of @xmath52 with our mc results shows that the discrepancy is really systematic for all intermediate cases .",
    "although this error is rather large , its systematic character strongly suggests that the physics of the crossover is already well taken into account by the mfa .",
    "let us analyse the function @xmath47 describing the auxiliary ensemble of the uncoupled on - site oscillators in more detail .",
    "let us stress the following points :    1 .",
    "the variation of @xmath3 with @xmath1 is within mfa entirely given by the slope of the function @xmath54 at @xmath55 .",
    "2 .   unlike the on - site potential @xmath56 , the function @xmath47 at finite temperature is a smooth monotonic odd function ( see figure 5 ) at any @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "both @xmath47 and its inverse @xmath58 can be expanded in taylor series : @xmath59 3 .",
    "the function @xmath60 can be identified with the derivative of its free energy @xmath61 , which can thus be written in the form @xmath62 4 .   obviously , the taylor expansion coefficients of @xmath47 and @xmath60 are related ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 , etc . )",
    "this allows to express @xmath65 in the limit case of the weak anharmonicity ( @xmath66 ) by expanding @xmath47 in powers of @xmath67 . with an accuracy @xmath68",
    "we obtain @xmath69 in the strongly anharmonic order - disorder limit ( @xmath70 ) , expressing @xmath47 via averages @xmath71 yields @xmath72 5 .",
    "finally , let us note that in the weak anharmonicity case we can solve the inverse problem - express the parameters of the on - site potential via the first two free energy coefficients @xmath73 . with the same accuracy as ( [ ob ] ) @xmath74      we have seen that the i m a predicts well the phase transition temperature in the displacive limit , while mfa predicts rather well its variation with @xmath1",
    ". it would be desirable to have an approximate equation of state for the system ( [ e1 ] ) that combines the advantages of both above discussed approaches .",
    "the key idea of our approach is the assumption of the existence of an effective potential ( with temperature dependent coefficients ) for which the self - consistent phonon approximation gives correctly the order parameter . in determining the coefficients of such an effective potential",
    ", we use the properties of the free energy @xmath75 ( respectively its derivative @xmath60 ) of the auxiliary system of uncoupled anharmonic oscillators discussed above .",
    "more precisely , the self - consistent equation for @xmath44 is constructed in three steps , as follows :    1 .",
    "we look for an effective on - site potential of the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are defined by the expressions that appear in the above discussed inverse problem ( [ inve ] ) : @xmath79 this potential obviously coincides with @xmath56 in the weak anharmonic limit .",
    "we introduce a function @xmath80 , which allows to write @xmath81 formally as a finite polynomial : @xmath82 these functions @xmath83 are used instead of @xmath84 in the definitions ( [ inve2 ] ) , so that we have @xmath85 note that the potential @xmath86 still coincides with @xmath56 in the weak anharmonic limit for small @xmath49 , since @xmath87 goes to @xmath88 for @xmath89 .",
    "3 .   we consider eq .",
    "( [ e2prime ] ) and replace @xmath56 with coefficients @xmath90 and @xmath67 by an expression @xmath86 with temperature - dependent coefficients @xmath91 and @xmath78 defined in eq .",
    "( [ sub2 ] ) . then we apply i m a to this auxiliary system .",
    "( [ ew cond ] ) then becomes @xmath92 \\eta + \\xi_{3}(t)\\eta^3 = 0 .",
    "\\label{finale}\\ ] ] + this equation is to be solved together with formulae ( [ xi1efe ] ) and ( [ deff ] ) , defining @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath95 , entering these equations , is given by the series ( [ t_exp ] ) .",
    "for the calculation of the phase transition temperature only , the second step can be omitted .",
    "it is obvious from its construction that the suggested method provides the same ( exact ) result for the @xmath3 in the displacive limit as the usual i m a . in the extreme order - disorder limit , the value of @xmath3 defined by ( [ finale ] ) can be obtained analytically using ( [ lim2 ] ) .",
    "the resulting value of @xmath96 overestimates the known ising value by less then 7% .",
    "the principal advantage of the modified approach is that it allows to calculate the @xmath3 ( and @xmath44 ) with the above or better accuracy for all values of @xmath1 , as it can be seen from the comparison with our mc data ( figure 6 ) .",
    "the mc result for @xmath97 is satisfactorily described as well ( figure 7 ) .",
    "let us analyze the proposed model in comparison with the standard decoupling schemes .",
    "the latter treat the system as a gas of elementary excitations , which are supposed to interact weakly .",
    "the assumption of weak interaction allows to replace the interaction between the elementary excitations with an interaction with an average field .",
    "choice of the elementary excitations as the plane waves or on - site oscillators yields i m a or mfa , respectively .",
    "it is clear , however , that the assumed weakness of the interaction is actually not realized for the general case , no matter what elementary excitations we choose .",
    "the main advantage of our approach is that it virtually replaces the real strongly - correlated system ( [ e1 ] ) with an auxiliary one , which allows decoupling .",
    "it is also worth noting that the theory is carried out in terms of @xmath54 , which is always a smooth monotonic function .",
    "moreover , @xmath54 does not change drastically when @xmath1 is varied from @xmath98 to @xmath2 - the calculation of parameters @xmath99 and @xmath100 at @xmath3 shows that their dimensionless values lie within the relatively narrow ranges @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "therefore the replacement procedure works uniformly well for all values of the parameters",
    ".    it would be interesting to investigate possible extensions to higher - order terms .",
    "a systematic extension of the present method should contain a larger number of terms in the effective on - site potential ( [ softpot ] ) and in the expression for the function @xmath60 in ( [ sub2 ] ) , and solve the self - consistent equation for the auxiliary system more accurately than ( [ finale ] ) .    as a simplification we can consider a purely linear auxiliary system , _",
    "i.e. _ neglect the @xmath78 term in ( [ softpot ] ) and @xmath95 in ( [ sub2 ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath103 and ( [ finale ] ) then reduces simply to the mean - field equation of state @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , the scheme proposed here can also be considered as a generalization of the mean field approximation .",
    "our method can be applied to more complicated models for which the self - consistent phonon theory is exact in the weak anharmonic limit .",
    "this is particularly interesting for the analysis of the diffour model @xcite in which the additional second neighbour harmonic coupling shows a phase transition to an incommensurate phase for which the mc calculations are much more difficult .",
    "we have studied the crossover from a displacive to an order - disorder phase transition in the discrete @xmath0 model with first - neighbour coupling .. the crossover is governed by the single parameter @xmath1 .",
    "quantitative information about @xmath22 and @xmath105 in this simple model may be helpful in elucidating the behaviour of some real crystals with phase transitions of a mixed displacive and order - disorder type .    in terms of the dimensionless parameter @xmath1 we determined the change of the transition temperature by monte - carlo calculations .",
    "these show a crossover from the displacive to the order - disorder limit .",
    "monte carlo calculations have shown an excellent agreement for @xmath3 in the two limit cases in which exact results are known .",
    "we expect that the same precision is obtained for the intermediate region .",
    "thus , the presented monte carlo results can be taken as quite reliable estimates of @xmath22 with a precision of the order of 1% and we believe that a comparable precision was achieved for the temperature dependence of the order parameter ( except in the critical region in the vicinity of the phase transition ) .    we have presented an analytical approach , which goes beyond the conventional decoupling schemes . for this , we introduce the auxiliary array of oscillators that ( i ) can be treated in the independent - mode approximation and ( ii ) yields approximately the same values of @xmath3 and the order parameter , as the real system .",
    "the method combines the equation of state of the self - consistent phonon theory with the response function of the system of uncoupled anharmonic oscillators used in the the mean - field theory .",
    "it can be presented as a generalization of the mean - field scheme .",
    "the analytical results for @xmath3 agree with monte - carlo simulations with about 5@xmath106 accuracy .",
    "further improvement could possibly come from higher order terms in the expansion we have used .",
    "the formalism can be used to study incommensurate phase transitions as well .",
