    "models of the chemical evolution of galaxies are key tools in the push to understand how galaxies formed and have evolved .",
    "their application to our galaxy is of particular importance both on account of the wealth of observational data that they can be required to reproduce , and on account of the inherent interest in deciphering the history of our environment .    from the pioneering papers by @xcite and",
    "@xcite it has generally been assumed that a galaxy such as the milky way can be divided into concentric cylindrical annuli , each of which evolves independently of the others ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the contents of any given cylinder are initially gaseous and of extremely low or zero metallicity . over time stars form in the cylinder and",
    "the more massive ones die , returning a mixture of heavy elements to the remaining gas .",
    "the consequent increase in the metallicity of the gas and newly - formed stars is generally moderated by an inflow of gas from intergalactic space , and , less often , by an outflow of supernova - heated gas .",
    "the cool , star - forming gas within any cylinder is assumed to be well mixed , so at any time it can be characterised by a metallicity @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the cylinder s radius . hence the stars formed within a given cylinder should have metallicities @xmath4 that are uniquely related to their time of formation , @xmath5 .",
    "observations do not substantiate this prediction ; in fact @xcite showed that solar - neighbourhood stars are widely distributed in the @xmath6 plane  for a detailed discussion see @xcite and section  [ sec : haywood ] .",
    "the absence of an age - metallicity relation in the solar neighbourhood is naturally explained by radial migration of stars @xcite .",
    "it has been recognised for many years that scattering by spiral structure and molecular clouds gradually heats the stellar disc , moving stars onto ever more eccentric and inclined orbits .",
    "stars that are on eccentric orbits clearly contribute to different cylindrical annuli at different phases of their orbits , and thus tend to modify any radial gradient in the metallicities of newly formed stars .",
    "moreover , scattering events also change the guiding centres of stellar orbits , so even a star on a circular orbit can be found at a different radius from that of its birth .",
    "in fact , @xcite argued that the dominant effect of transient spiral structure is resonant scattering of stars across the structure s corotation resonance , so even a star that is still on a near - circular orbit may be far from its radius of birth .",
    "@xcite showed that in a cosmological simulation of galaxy formation that included both stars and gas , resonant scattering at corotation caused stars to move outwards and gas inwards , with the result that the stellar disc extended beyond the outer limit of star formation ; the outer disc was entirely populated by stars that had formed much further in and yet were still on nearly circular orbits .",
    "this simulation confirmed the conjecture of @xcite that gas would participate in resonant scattering alongside stars .",
    "we distinguish two drivers of radial migration : when the angular momentum of a star is changed , whether by scattering at an orbital resonance or by non - resonant scattering by a molecular cloud , the star s guiding - centre radius changes and the star s entire orbit moves inwards or outwards depending on whether angular momentum is lost or gained .",
    "when a scattering event increases a star s epicycle amplitude without changing its angular momentum , the star contributes to the density over a wider range of radii . in a slight modification of the terminology introduced by @xcite",
    ", we say that changes in angular momentum cause `` churning '' while changes in epicycle amplitude lead to `` blurring '' .",
    "this paper extends models of galactic chemical evolution to include the effects of churning and blurring .",
    "given the strength of the arguments that cold gas should participate in churning alongside stars , and that shocks induced by spiral structure cause gas to drift inwards , it is mandatory simultaneously to extend traditional chemical evolution models to include radial flows of gas within the disc .",
    "@xcite studied chemical evolution in the presence of a radial inflow of gas and demonstrated that a radial flow enhances the metallicity gradient within the disc .",
    "this enhancement plays an important role in our models , which differ from those of lacey & fall in that they include both radial gas flows and radial migration of stars .",
    "moreover we can fit our models to observational data that is much richer than that available to @xcite .",
    "our models are complementary to ab - initio models of galaxy formation such as those presented by @xcite and @xcite in that they allow the solar neighbourhood to be resolved in greater detail , and because they are enormously less costly numerically , they permit parameter searches to be made that are not feasible with ab - initio models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : goveqs ] presents the equations upon which the models are based .",
    "these consist of the rules that determine the rate of infall of fresh gas , the rate of star formation , details of the stellar evolution tracks and chemical yields that we have used and descriptions of how churning and blurring are implemented .",
    "section [ sec : standard ] describes in some detail a `` standard '' model of the evolution of the galactic disc .",
    "this covers its global properties but focuses on what would be seen in a survey of the solar neighbourhood .",
    "section [ sec : snhd ] presents the details of the selection function that is required to mimic the geneva ",
    "copenhagen sample ( gcs ) of solar - neighbourhood stars published by @xcite and @xcite , and explains how this sample has been used to constrain the model s parameters .",
    "section [ sec : trend ] explains how the observable properties of the model depend on its parameters .",
    "section [ sec : reln ] discusses the relation of the present models to earlier ones , and discusses the extent to which it is consistent with the analysis of solar - neighbourhood data by @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : conclude ] sums up .",
    "the simulation is advanced by a series of discrete timesteps of duration @xmath7 .",
    "the disc is divided into 80 annuli of width @xmath8 and central radii that range from @xmath9 to @xmath10 . in each annulus there",
    "is both `` cold '' ( @xmath11 ) and `` warm '' ( @xmath12 ) gas with specified abundances @xmath13 of helium and heavy elements .",
    "the `` warm gas '' is not available for star formation and should be understood to include both inter - cloud gas within the plane and extraplanar gas , which probably contains a significant fraction of the galaxy s ism . indeed , in ngc@xmath14891 ,",
    "a galaxy similar to the milky way , of order a third of hi is extraplanar @xcite . in the milky way this gas would constitute the `` intermediate - velocity clouds '' that are observed at high and intermediate galactic latitudes @xcite .    within the heavy elements we keep track of the abundances of o ,",
    "c , mg , si , ca and fe . each annulus has a stellar population for each elapsed timestep , and this population inherits the abundances @xmath15 , @xmath16 , etc .",
    ", of the local cold gas . at each stellar mass ,",
    "the stellar lifetime is determined by the initial abundances , and at each age we know the luminosity and colours of such of its stars that are not yet dead .",
    "each stellar population is at all times associated with the annulus of its birth ; the migration of stars is taken into account as described below only when returning matter to the ism or constructing an observational sample of stars .",
    "the whole field of chemical modelling has been thrown into turmoil by the discovery that three - dimensional , non - equilibrium models of the solar atmosphere require the metal abundance of the sun to be @xmath17 @xcite rather than the traditional value @xmath18 .",
    "this work suggests that the entire metallicity scale needs to be thoroughly reviewed : if the sun s metallicity has to be revised downwards , then so will the metallicities of most nearby stars .",
    "crucially there is the possibility that values for the metallicity of the ism require revision : some values derive from measurements of the metallicities of short - lived stars such as b stars and require downward revision ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while others are inferred from measurements of the strengths of interstellar emission lines , and are not evidently affected by changes in stellar metallicities .",
    "if the metallicity scale of stars were lowered while that of the ism remained substantially unaltered , it would be exceedingly hard to construct a viable model of the chemical evolution of the solar neighbourhood .",
    "moreover , both the stellar catalogue and most of the measurements of interstellar abundances with which we wish to compare our models are on the old metallicity scale , and unphysical anomalies will become rife as soon as one mixes values on the old scale with ones on the new .",
    "therefore for consistency we use the old solar abundance @xmath19 and exclude from considerable metallicity values that are on the new scale .",
    "stars form according to the @xcite law . specifically , with the surface density of cold gas @xmath20 measured in @xmath21 and @xmath22 in myr , star formation increases the stellar surface density at a rate @xmath23 where the threshold for star formation , @xmath24 is a parameter of the model and @xmath25 ensures that the star - formation rate is a continuous function of surface density .",
    "the normalisation in equation ( [ eq : kenni ] ) was chosen to yield the observed surface densities of gas and stars near the sun .",
    "the stars are assumed to be distributed in initial mass over the range @xmath26 according to the salpeter function , @xmath27 .",
    "the luminosities , effective temperatures , colours and lifetimes of these stars are taken by linear interpolation in @xmath13 from the values given in the basti database @xcite .",
    "the nucleosynthetic yields of individual metals are in many cases still subject to significant uncertainties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; in fact models of the chemical evolution of the solar neighbourhood have been used to constrain these yields @xcite .    for initial masses in the ranges @xmath28 and @xmath29 values of @xmath30,c and o",
    "were taken from @xcite using a non - linear interpolation scheme : the paper gives yields @xmath31 for a low metallicity ( @xmath32 ) and yields @xmath33 for a high metallicity ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "guided by the metallicity - dependence of the sizes of co cores reported by @xcite we take @xmath35 where @xmath36 the yields of elements other than @xmath30,c and o from stars with masses in this range were taken from the _",
    "orfeo _ database of @xcite with the mass cut set such that @xmath37 of @xmath38ni is produced ; this relatively low mass cut reproduces the ca / fe ratio measured in very metal - poor stars by @xcite .",
    "stars less massive than @xmath39 were assumed to produce no elements heavier than o. for stars with masses @xmath40 , the yields were taken by linear interpolation from @xcite .    for initial stellar masses in the range @xmath41 we used the metallicity - dependent yields of heavy elements from @xcite by linear interpolation on mass and metallicity , extrapolating up to @xmath42 or @xmath43 respectively .",
    "@xcite used a relatively high mass cut , which produced @xmath44 of @xmath38ni . with our interpolation",
    "the average amount of @xmath38ni produced is well within the expected range .",
    "a fraction @xmath45 of the gas ejected by dying stars leaves the galaxy ; we tested models with @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "increasing @xmath45 has the effect of reducing the final metallicity of the disc ; in fact there is almost complete degeneracy between the values of @xmath45 and nucleosynthetic yields . in view of the evidence that star formation near the galactic centre drives a galactic wind @xcite , we set @xmath47 at @xmath48 in models that use the accretion law ( [ eq : mdot ] ) below . at all other radii",
    "we set @xmath49 .",
    "a fraction @xmath50 of the ejecta goes straight to the cold gas reservoir of the local annulus , and the balance goes to the annulus s warm - gas reservoir . setting @xmath50 to values @xmath51 has a significant impact on the number of extremely metal - poor stars predicted near the sun .",
    "however , such large values of @xmath50 are not well motivated physically , and in the models presented here @xmath52 has a negligible value .    in each timestep",
    "@xmath53 a fraction @xmath54 of the `` warm '' gas ( which includes extraplanar gas ) transfers to the cold - gas reservoir from which stars form . the parameter @xmath55 is determined by the dynamics of extraplanar gas and the balance between radiative cooling and shock heating within the plane .",
    "consequently , its value can not be determined a priori from atomic physics .",
    "increasing @xmath55 increases the mass of `` warm '' gas and delays the incorporation of freshly made metals into new stars , so the number of very metal - poor stars formed increases with @xmath55 . although of order a quarter of the neutral hydrogen of ngc 891 is extraplanar @xcite , some of this gas will be formerly cold interstellar gas that has been shock accelerated by stellar ejecta .",
    "we do not model shock heating of cold gas , and replenish the warm - gas reservoir exclusively with stellar ejecta ( from stars of every mass ) .",
    "hence the warm - gas reservoir should be less massive than the sum of the extraplanar and warm in - plane bodies of gas in a galaxy like ngc 891 .",
    "we have worked with values @xmath56 that yield warm - gas fractions of order 10 percent .",
    "the results of the models are not sensitive to the value of @xmath57 .",
    "there is abundant evidence that pristine intergalactic gas disappeared from the intergalactic medium ( igm ) long ago : quasar absorption - line studies reveal an early build up of heavy elements in the igm @xcite . while it is clear that the disc formed from material that had been enriched by pregalactic and halo stars , it is unclear what abundances this material had .",
    "we take the chemical composition of the pre - enriched gas to be that of the `` warm '' ism after two timesteps , starting with @xmath58 of pristine gas . in each of the following four timesteps ,",
    "a further @xmath59 of gas with this metallicity is added to the disc .",
    "the surface density of the added gas is proportional to @xmath60 thus the surface density is exponential with scalelength @xmath61 inside @xmath62 but tapered to zero at the outer edge of the grid .",
    "the existence at the outset of a warm , pre - enriched component of the ism is physically well motivated and proves the most effective way of producing the right number of metal - poor stars .",
    "type ia supernovae are included by assuming that @xmath63 per cent of the mass in white dwarfs formed by stars of initial mass 3.2 to @xmath64 ultimately explodes in type ia supernovae .",
    "the yields were taken to be those of the w70 model in @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the progenitors of type ia supernovae have lifetimes of order a gyr @xcite and we have taken the mass @xmath65 of the population that survives to time @xmath22 from white - dwarf formation to satisfy @xmath66 the rate of type ia sne is constrained by the requirements that ( i ) [ o / fe ] has to fall from @xmath67 for the oldest stars to around @xmath68 , and ( ii ) [ ca / fe ] should go from about @xmath69 to @xmath70 . the full curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : snirate ] shows for the best - fitting model the mass - return rate as a function of time , while the green dashed curve shows the sfr at the solar radius .",
    "it is generally agreed that viable models of galactic chemical evolution require the disc to be constantly fed with gas from intergalactic space ; inflow resolves several serious problems , including ( i ) the appearance of too many low - metallicity stars near the sun ( the  g - dwarf problem  , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , ( ii ) excessive metallicity of the current ism , ( iii ) an unrealistically low abundance of deuterium in the current ism @xcite . moreover ,",
    "both the short timescale for the current ism to be consumed by star formation and direct manifestations of infalling gas @xcite argue strongly for the existence of infall . unfortunately , many aspects of infall are extremely uncertain .",
    "we find that the predictions of our models depend sensitively on how these uncertainties are resolved , so to the extent that other aspects of our models have sound foundations , they can usefully constrain the nature of infall .    in principle the rate and radial distribution of infall is determined by cosmology . for example , @xcite infer it by assuming that the disc scale length grows in parallel with the cosmic scale , while @xcite derive the global rate from n - body simulations . at this stage",
    "we feel that cosmological simulations are beset by too many uncertainties to deliver even a secure global infall rate , never mind the radial distribution of infall .",
    "in particular the extent of angular - momentum exchange between baryons and dark matter is controversial , as are the extent to which gas is accreted from cold infall rather than a hot corona .",
    "moreover , nothing is known with any confidence about the dynamics of the corona .    for want of clear inputs from cosmology",
    "we have sought a flexible parametrisation of infall .",
    "first we parametrise the global infall rate , and then the radial distribution of infall .",
    "we have investigated two approaches to the determination of the infall rate .",
    "the first starts with a quantity of gas ( @xmath71 ) and feeds gas into it at a rate @xmath72 here @xmath73 is a short timescale that ensures that the star - formation rate peaks early on , while @xmath74 is a long timescale associated with sustained star formation in the thin disc .",
    "we adopt @xmath75 and choose @xmath76 such that after @xmath77 the second exponential has delivered @xmath78 .    in an alternative scheme",
    ", the gas mass within the disc is determined a priori and infall is assumed to be available to maintain the gas mass at its prescribed level .",
    "we have investigated schemes in which the gas mass declines exponentially with time , but focused on models in which it is held constant at @xmath79 ; models in which the gas mass declines exponentially produce very similar results to models in which the infall rate declines exponentially .",
    "we know even less about the radial distribution of the infalling gas than we do about the global infall rate .",
    "in fact our only constraint is that the stellar disc has an approximately exponential surface density now , and was probably exponential at earlier times too . besides the star - formation law",
    ", the structure of the stellar disc depends on both the radial distribution of infall and gas flows within the disc , and a disc that is consistent with observations will not be formed if either the radial infall profile or the internal gas flow is fixed without regard to the other process .",
    "consequently , the requirement that only observationally acceptable discs be produced requires one to develop a parametrisation that couples infall and flow in a possibly unphysical way .",
    "the scheme we have developed involves such an unphysical coupling  this is the price one pays for a scheme that allows one to explore as economically but fully as possible a range of infall profiles and internal flows that are consistent with the known radial structure of the disc .",
    "we start from the assumption that the surface - density of gas is at all times exponential , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is chosen such that with the star - formation law adopted above , the inner stellar disc acquires a scale length @xmath82 similar to that determined from star counts @xcite .",
    "our value for the scale length of the gas disc is in good agreement with the value measured by @xcite : @xmath83 .",
    "notice that we assume not only that the stellar disc is exponential , but that its scale length is unchanging .",
    "hence we are assuming that the disc forms simultaneously at all radii , rather than `` inside - out '' .",
    "the remarkably large age estimated for the solar neighbourhood ( at @xmath84 ) suggests simultaneous formation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . however , our work could be readily generalised to inside - out growth by making @xmath85 a specified function of time ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ) , but we reserve this extension for a later paper .",
    "our scheme for parameterising infall and flow depends on two parameters , @xmath86 and @xmath87 and is easiest to explain by considering first the limiting cases in which one parameter vanishes .",
    "either of the algorithms of the last subsection specifies what the total gas mass should be at the start of a timestep : this is either the prescribed constant or , when equation ( [ eq : mdot ] ) is used , it is the mass in the disc at the end of the previous timestep plus the amount that falls in during the most recent timestep .",
    "hence the mass that should be in each annulus at the start of a timestep follows from the assumed exponential profile of the gas disc . subtracting from this the mass that was present after the previous timestep",
    ", we calculate the need , i.e. the amount of gas that has to be added , of the @xmath88th annulus @xmath89 .",
    "we fill annuli up with gas in sequence , starting with the innermost ring @xmath90 . when @xmath91 ( `` scheme a '' ) this annulus receives @xmath92 from the igm , and grabs the balance , @xmath93 , from annulus 1 , where @xmath94 is a parameter of the model .",
    "annulus @xmath95 receives @xmath96 from the igm , and grabs the balance of its requirement , @xmath97 , from annulus @xmath98 .",
    "the updating of every annulus proceeds similarly , until the last annulus is reached , which covers its entire need from the igm .",
    "the characteristic of this `` scheme a '' is the development of a large flux of gas through the outer rings ",
    "an example is given by the full red curve in the upper panel of .",
    "this flux transports inwards metals synthesised in these rings and tends to deposit them at intermediate radii , where the inward flux is diminishing .    when @xmath99 ( `` scheme b '' ) annulus @xmath90 obtains @xmath100 from the igm and the rest from annulus @xmath95 .",
    "annulus @xmath95 now obtains @xmath101 $ ] from the igm , and so on to the outermost ring , which is again entirely fed by the igm .",
    "the short dashed blue curve in the upper panel of shows a typical example of a mass flow through the disc with scheme b. whereas the flow generated by scheme a ( red curve ) increases monotonically from the centre , the scheme - b flow rises quickly with galactocentric distance @xmath102 near the centre but then peaks at @xmath103 . in the outer region",
    "in which the inflow is small , the metallicity forms a plateau .",
    "the extent of this plateau is controlled by @xmath87 : the larger @xmath87 , the smaller the radius at which the inflow rate peaks and the further in the metallicity plateau extends .    in either of these schemes",
    "a fixed fraction of each annulus s need is taken from the igm , but the definition of `` need '' is different in the two schemes : in scheme b it includes the gas that was taken from it by its inner neighbour , and in scheme a it does not . in scheme a only a fixed fraction of the local need is provided by the igm , so the flow @xmath104 in the disc continuously builds up through the disc . in scheme b , by contrast , a part of the flow required in scheme a is met by additional accretion . consequently , if one wrote an equation for @xmath105 , a term @xmath106 would appear , where @xmath107 is the width of annuli , and this term drives exponential decay of @xmath104 .",
    "scheme a enhances the metallicity of the middle section of the disc and causes the metallicity gradient to be steepest towards the outside of the disc , scheme b enhances the metallicity of the inner disc and flattens the gradient at large radii .    in scheme",
    "a , if @xmath86 is set too low , the flux of gas through the outer annuli becomes implausibly large in relation to the mass of gas that is in these annuli , and radial flow velocities @xmath108 are predicted . in scheme",
    "b @xmath87 can be quite small because , although the flow of gas through the disc builds up more quickly at small radii , it peaks at a few kiloparsecs and then declines to small values in the outer disc .",
    "if either @xmath86 or @xmath87 is large , the flow through the disc becomes small and the metallicity of the solar neighbourhood becomes unrealistically large through the accumulation of metals created at the solar radius and beyond .",
    "satisfactory fits to the data can be obtained only when both @xmath86 and @xmath87 are non - zero in this `` scheme ab '' annulus @xmath90 receives a mass @xmath109 from the igm and grabs the balance @xmath110 from annulus @xmath95 .",
    "annulus @xmath95 receives a mass @xmath111 from the igm and grabs the balance of its requirement from annulus @xmath98 , and so on .",
    "notice that the radial flow profile in scheme ab is not simply the sum of the corresponding profiles for schemes a and b used alone .",
    "the green curve in the upper panel of shows the radial flow profile obtained with scheme ab with the parameters of the standard model . in this model",
    "the radial velocity of disc gas currently rises roughly linearly from zero at the centre to @xmath112 at the sun . beyond the sun",
    "a plot of radial velocity versus radius gradually steepens to reach @xmath113 at the edge of the disc .    for each accretion scheme , the lower panel of shows the corresponding radial distribution of accretion from the igm .",
    "we have to prescribe the metallicity and alpha - enhancement of gas taken from the igm .",
    "it is far from clear how this should be done .",
    "quasar absorption line - studies reveal an early build up of heavy elements in the igm @xcite .",
    "moreover , the handful of high - velocity clouds for which metallicities have been measured , have heavy - element abundances of order a tenth solar @xcite . finally , the metallicities of the most metal - poor thick - disc stars are similar to the metallicities of the most metal - rich halo stars , which suggests that the early disc was pre - enriched by pregalactic and halo stars .",
    "we assume that throughout the simulation accreted gas has metallicity @xmath114 .",
    "given that the thick disc is alpha - enhanced @xcite , it is clear that when disc formation starts , infalling gas must be alpha - enhanced .",
    "it is natural that this enhancement should decline with time as fe from type ia sne finds its way into the igm .",
    "indeed , in addition to gas that flows out in the galactic wind @xcite , type ia sne in dwarf spheroidal galaxies will have contributed their fe to the local igm , and if the magellanic stream is made of gas torn from the smc , it will have been enriched with fe from sne in the smc .",
    "thus we expect the metallicity and alpha enhancement of the igm to be time dependent and governed by the chemical - evolution histories of galaxies .",
    "these considerations suggest making the @xmath0-enhancement of the igm reflect that of an outer annulus of the galaxy ; the chemical evolution of this ring acts as a proxy for the combined chemical evolution of the many contributors to the chemical evolution of the igm .",
    "if the igm were assumed to mirror the outermost ring , its @xmath0-enhancement would remain extremely low because this annulus takes all its gas from the igm , and passes what few heavy elements it synthesises inwards .",
    "hence the igm must mirror an outer annulus but not the outermost . in our models",
    "the @xmath0-enhancement of the igm mirrors the annulus with radius @xmath115 .",
    "since yields of @xmath0 elements decline with increasing metallicity , the outer disc should be @xmath0-enhanced .",
    "transient spiral arms cause both stars and gas to be exchanged between annuli in the vicinity of the corotation resonance .",
    "such exchanges automatically conserve both angular momentum and mass .",
    "since these exchanges are driven by spiral structure , in which hot and extraplanar gas is not expected to participate , churning is confined to stars and cold gas .",
    "we restrict exchanges to adjacent rings but allow two exchanges per timestep , so within a timestep second - nearest neighbouring rings exchange mass .",
    "further studies of spiral structure in high - quality n - body simulations are required to determine how the probability of a star migrating varies across the disc . in the absence of such studies",
    "the following dimensional argument suggests what the answer might be .",
    "consider the probability @xmath116 that in a characteristic dynamical time @xmath117 ( where @xmath118 is the local epicycle frequency ) a star is involved in a resonant exchange across corotation .",
    "it is natural that a process dependent on gravitational self - energy in the disc should scale with the square of the surface density .",
    "toomre s @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the radial velocity dispersion , is a dimensionless variable , so we conjecture that @xmath121 .",
    "our grid is uniform in @xmath102 whereas an exchange across corotation changes @xmath102 by of order the most unstable wavelength @xmath122 . the number of swaps between rings required to wander a distance @xmath123 scales as @xmath124 .",
    "moreover , the number of ring - swaps in time @xmath117 scales as @xmath117 , so the ring - swap probability per timestep @xmath125 should be @xmath126 times @xmath116 .",
    "this argument yields @xmath127 .",
    "in realistic cases @xmath128 and @xmath129 , so @xmath130 , the mass of a ring .",
    "this argument suggests that we take the probability @xmath131 that in a given half - timestep a star or gas cloud in the @xmath88th annulus is transferred to the @xmath132th annulus to be @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the mass in cold gas and stars in the @xmath132th annulus and @xmath135 .",
    "this rule ensures that the mass transferring outwards from the @xmath88th annulus is proportional to @xmath136 , and an equal mass transfers inwards , ensuring that angular momentum is conserved .",
    "the constant @xmath137 is the largest transition probability for any annulus in a given timestep .",
    "it is treated as a free parameter to be fitted to the data .",
    "the procedure for distributing the metals released by a population of stars born in annulus @xmath88 is as follows .",
    "the probability that a star born in annulus @xmath88 at timestep @xmath138 is found to be in annulus @xmath132 at timestep @xmath139 is equal to the @xmath140th element of the product matrix @xmath141 . in practice",
    "we recompute @xmath142 only each five timesteps and approximate @xmath143 by @xmath144 .",
    "[ fig : churndist ] shows the extent to which the guiding centres of stars are changed over the lifetime of the galaxy when @xmath145 .",

    "similarly , he found that stars in the high - metallicity tail of the local metallicity distribution have low angular momenta . even though churning could in principle eradicate the correlation between angular momentum and metallicity",
    ", our models reproduce these correlations ( figs  [ fig : alpha_thick ] and [ fig : vphiz ] ) because blurring makes a sufficiently large contribution to bringing these chemically anomalous stars near the sun .",
    "@xcite also argue that in the sdss data the kinematic properties of the thick disc evolve continuously with distance from the plane in a way that suggests that the thick disc joins continuously to the thin disc .",
    "by contrast , @xcite argued for a clean break between the thin and thick discs on the basis of shallow local minima in the density of 2mass stars @xmath292 in seen at the galactic poles as a function of photometric distance @xmath209 .",
    "as @xcite show , minima in @xmath292 are not expected if the disc is a superposition of two exponential structures , but the minima yield a clean discontinuity in the distribution of velocity dispersions when multi - component isothermal distribution functions are used to model the data .",
    "the very unexpectedness of the minima makes the modelled break extremely clean",
    ". it will be interesting to see whether the distribution of measured radial velocities of stars in the rave survey substantiate these model velocity distributions .",
    "it is now more than forty years since the theory of stellar evolution attained the level at which it became possible to model the chemical enrichment of the ism . from the beginning of that endeavour measurements of the abundances of individual solar - neighbourhood stars",
    "have played a key role because a star preserves like a time capsule the state of the ism at the remote epoch of its formation .",
    "considerable theoretical and observational efforts have been devoted to probing the history of the galaxy with this connection .",
    "half a century ago , @xcite and others discovered the connection between the kinematics and chemistry of stars , yet curiously little has been done to include kinematics in models of chemical evolution .",
    "the general presumption has been that each annulus of the disc evolves independently of others , and the well - known correlations between chemistry and kinematics can be understood as arising through the stochastic acceleration of stars : older stars tend to have larger random velocities and lower metallicities .",
    "no effort was made to develop greater diagnostic power by simultaneously modelling chemistry and kinematics .",
    "the continued use of mutually independent annuli by modellers of chemical evolution is surprising given that it was from the outset recognised that many stars are on significantly non - circular orbits that each radial half - period cover more than a kiloparsec in radius .",
    "in fact , it has generally been assumed that the radial velocity dispersion within the disc rises as one moves inward to values that lead to radial excursions of several kiloparsecs ( see ) .",
    "moreover , observations have long indicated that galactic discs have significant metallicity gradients ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so radial migration of stars is bound to leave a signature on the metallicity distribution of solar - neighbourhood stars .",
    "we have called this aspect of radial migration `` blurring '' .",
    "the present study owes its impetus to the discovery by @xcite that radial migration is a more potent process than mere blurring : the dominant effect of transient spiral arms is not to heat the stellar disc as had been supposed , but to cause stars either side of corotation to change places without moving to eccentric orbits ( `` churning '' ) .",
    "@xcite did not demonstrate that gas participates in churning , but they argued that it must on dynamical grounds , and @xcite found evidence that this was the case in their n - body  sph simulations of galaxy formation . since churning is an aspect of spiral structure that can _ only _ be probed through its impact on chemical evolution , we wanted chemical - evolution models that included churning , and logically it was natural to extend these models to include both blurring and radial gas flows .",
    "an ingredient of our models that might be controversial is the introduction of radial gas flows .",
    "we have absolutely no reason to expect that the infall profile is exponential , so if discs are to be exponential this must be the result of flows through the discs redistributing mass within the disc .",
    "in fact , as gas streams through spiral arms it dissipates energy in shocks that is ultimately gravitational energy that becomes free as the gas surrenders angular momentum to the stars and drifts inwards .",
    "hence at some level inward gas flows are mandatory @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the theory of galaxy formation has yet to advance to the point at which it can prescribe the spatial and temporal structure of gas accretion , so it is necessary to parametrise accretion in some way .",
    "the accretion process must be constrained to result in the formation of the observed stellar and gaseous discs .",
    "our accretion scheme ab satisfies this constraint for all values of the parameters , but it is inevitably acausal in that the formation mechanism is being driven by its known outcome . while its acausality is unattractive , scheme ab is a flexible parametrisation that enables us to form exponential discs for a variety of different assumptions about the radial density of infalling gas , and the resulting radial profiles of infall and gas - flow ( ) are entirely plausible .",
    "the impact that radial migration has on the local metallicity distribution obviously varies with the magnitude of the metallicity gradient in the ism , which in turn depends on the gas flow within the disc and therefore the radial infall profile . for this reason the most important parameters of our models are @xmath86 and @xmath87 , which control the distribution of infalling gas .",
    "the models provide good fits to the gcs counts of stars as functions of @xmath265 , @xmath293 , @xmath220 and stellar age , as well as reproducing the correlations between tangential velocity and abundance patterns that have been pointed out by @xcite .",
    "these fits are achieved by churning , blurring and radial flows working together .",
    "they depend on the existence of an appreciable metallicity gradient in the ism , which is established by the radial flow of gas , and they depend on radial mixing of stars by blurring and churning .",
    "the steeper the metallicity gradient in the gas , the smaller the effect of churning can be , but for any observationally consistent metallicity gradient , churning has a non - negligible role to play .",
    "the models describe the coevolution of the thick and thin discs , and presume that thick - disc stars were formed in the galaxy rather than accreted from outside .",
    "given the simplicity of our assumptions , the extent to which a dichotomy between an @xmath0-enhanced thick disc and a solar - type thin disc automatically manifests itself in the models is remarkable .",
    "in particular , in the solar annulus the distributions of [ o / h ] at given @xmath265 are bimodal in the range of @xmath265 associated with the overlap of the two discs ( ) , the vertical density profile can be represented at the sum of two exponentials , and at @xmath294 the radial density profile becomes flatter at lager distances from the plane ( ) .",
    "none of these characteristics is dependent on our choice of a double exponential for the time dependence of infall : a model in which the gaseous mass , and therefore star - formation rate , is held constant also has these features .",
    "they are consequences of the @xmath229 timescale of type ia supernovae and the secular heating and churning of the disc .",
    "the models assume that scattering of stars increases the velocity dispersion of a coeval population as @xmath295 , but the models go on to predict that within the solar neighbourhood velocity dispersion increases as a higher power of age , roughly @xmath296 in agreement with what is found from hipparcos stars with good parallaxes .",
    "this finding may reconcile scattering theory , which can not readily explain an exponent in excess of @xmath297 , with observations .",
    "the key point is that radial mixing brings to the solar neighbourhood stars born at small radii , where the velocity dispersion is undoubtedly large .",
    "the nucleosynthetic yields from each generation of stars are still significantly uncertain .",
    "our philosophy has been to use standard values from the literature rather than exploit uncertainties in the yields to tune the models to the data .",
    "the yields we are using are in the upper region of those that can provide adequate fits to the data , with the consequence that increasing the value of the mass - loss parameter @xmath45 , which is degenerate with the magnitude of the yields , makes it easier to fit the data .",
    "our yields are surely not exactly right and consequently some of the properties the models derive from them will be in error . on account of these uncertainties we have suppressed the predictions of our code for the abundances of certain elements , most notably carbon .    the discovery that three - dimensional , non - equilibrium models of the solar atmosphere require the metal abundance of the sun to be @xmath17 @xcite poses a major problem for this field .",
    "a prerequisite for successful chemical modelling is a consistent metallicity scale for both stars and the ism . at present",
    "the only consistent scale is the traditional one on which @xmath19 , so this is the one we have used .",
    "if a new scale were established on which all metallicities were significantly lower , viable models could be produced by lowering the yields . a straightforward way to do",
    "this would be to lower the maximum mass in the imf : reducing this mass from @xmath298 to @xmath299 would reduce yields by @xmath300 percent in line with the proposed reduction in @xmath301 .",
    "the oxygen yield would come down fastest , reducing [ o / fe ] by @xmath302 .",
    "although we believe that this study represents a significant advance on all previous models of galactic chemical evolution , it is highly imperfect . some major weaknesses of our work are the following .",
    "* we have assumed that the probability of mass interchange between rings is proportional to the product of the rings masses .",
    "this probability reflects the number and intensity of spiral feature with corotation at that radius , and should be a function of both mass and velocity dispersion .",
    "a further study of self - gravitating discs similar to that of @xcite would be necessary to determine this function .",
    "* we have assumed that the vertical and radial motions of stars decouple .",
    "this assumption has a significant impact on both the relation between age and velocity dispersion in the solar neighbourhood and on the predicted vertical density profile in the solar annulus , which is interesting in itself and impacts on the selection function of gcs stars and thus on our choice of standard model .",
    "the assumption is unjustifiable for stars on eccentric orbits , which do play an important role in the model fits .",
    "unfortunately , a sounder treatment is impossible until a better approximation to the third integral of galactic dynamics is available .",
    "it is our intention to resolve this problem through `` torus modelling '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* our models include radial mixing of gas through churning and viscous inspiralling , but do not include radial redistribution of gas by the galactic fountain ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a significant body of evidence indicates that star formation drives neutral hydrogen to kiloparsec heights above the plane .",
    "ngc@xmath14891 , which is not dissimilar to the galaxy , has @xmath303 per cent of its neutral hydrogen more than @xmath304 from the plane @xcite .",
    "this extraplanar gas must move over the plane on nearly ballistic trajectories , and in the absence of interaction with the corona ( gas at the galaxy s virial temperature @xmath305 ) , the gas must return to the plane further out than its point of ejection .",
    "however , observations suggest that neutral gas above the plane is actually flowing inward rather than outward , presumable as a result of interaction with the corona @xcite .",
    "the mass of extraplanar gas is so large and the timescale for its return to the plane so short that whichever way this gas flows , it has a considerable potential for radially redistributing metals .",
    "extraplanar gas must be ejected from the disc by supernova - heated gas that is probably highly metal - rich .",
    "some of this gas will be lost to the galaxy as we have assumed , but some of it will return to the plane with infalling gas .",
    "again there is potential here for significant radial redistribution of metals that has been ignored in the present study . *",
    "our treatment of the inner galaxy is unacceptably crude in that we have replaced the bar / bulge with a disc .",
    "unfortunately introducing the bar opens a pandora s box of complexities , and at the present time is probably only feasible in the context of a particle - based model such as those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our hope is that our imaginary central disc has a similar impact on the chemodynamical state of the local disc to the combined impact of the giant star - forming ring at @xmath306 , the gas - deficient region interior to this ring and the star - forming @xmath307 disc at @xmath308 .    from this list of shortcomings of our models",
    "it is clear that we are still far from a definitive account of the galaxy s chemical evolution",
    ". we shall be satisfied if we have convinced the reader that the interplay between dynamics and chemistry is so tight at to be indissoluble .",
    "this fact is at one level inconvenient because it undermines the value of conclusions drawn from traditional models of chemical evolution .",
    "but at another level it represents an opportunity to learn more .",
    "the connection between the kinematics of stars and the compositions of stars and gas , which can be measured in great detail , involves three areas about which we are too ignorant : the distribution of dark matter within and around the galaxy , the galaxy s history of assembly , and the nature of the local group s igm . by building dynamical models of the galaxy that have chemical evolution built in to the basic structure",
