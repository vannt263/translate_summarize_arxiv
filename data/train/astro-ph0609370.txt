    "the star - formation efficiency ( sfe ) , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 are the mass in freshly formed stars and residual gas , respectively , is @xmath3 @xmath4 @xcite implying that the physics dominating the star - formation process on scales @xmath5  pc is stellar feedback . within this volume , the pre - cluster cloud core contracts under self gravity thereby forming stars ever more vigorously , until feedback energy suffices to halt the process ( _ feedback - termination _ ) @xcite .",
    "this occurs on one to a few crossing times ( @xmath6  yr ) , and since each proto - star needs about @xmath7  yr to accumulate about 95  per cent of its mass @xcite , the assumption may be made that the embedded cluster is mostly virialised at feedback - termination .",
    "its stellar velocity dispersion ,    @xmath8    may then reach @xmath9pc / myr if @xmath10 which is the case for @xmath11  pc .",
    "this is easily achieved since the radius of one - myr old clusters is @xmath12  pc with a weak , if any dependence on mass @xcite .",
    "very young clusters ( age  @xmath13  myr ) would thus appear super - virial , i.e. with a velocity dispersion too large for the cluster mass .",
    "the above exercise demonstrates that the possibility may be given that a _ hot kinematical component _",
    "could add to a galactic disk as a result of clustered star formation for reasonable physical parameters .",
    "thickened galactic disks may result .",
    "but this depends on    \\(i ) @xmath14 ,    \\(ii ) @xmath15 ( cluster concentration ) and    \\(iii ) the ratio of the gas - expulsion time - scale to the dynamical time of the embedded cluster , @xmath16 .",
    "the first ( i ) of these is clearly fulfilled : @xmath17  per cent @xcite .",
    "the second ( ii ) also appears to be fulfilled such that clusters with ages @xmath18  myr have @xmath19  pc independently of their mass .",
    "some well - studied cases are tabulated and discussed in @xcite .",
    "finally , the ratio @xmath20 ( iii ) remains uncertain but critical .",
    "the well - observed cases discussed in @xcite do indicate that the removal of most of the residual gas does occur within a cluster - dynamical time , @xmath21 .",
    "examples noted are the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) and r136 in the lmc both having significant super - virial velocity dispersions .",
    "other examples are the treasure - chest cluster and the very young star - bursting clusters in the massively - interacting antennae galaxy which appear to have hii regions expanding at velocities such that the cluster volume may be evacuated within a cluster dynamical time .",
    "a simple calculation of the amount of energy deposited by an o  star within a cluster crossing time into its surrounding cluster - nebula also suggests it to be larger than the nebula binding energy @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite note that many young clusters have a radial - density profile signature as expected if they are expanding rapidly .",
    "thus , the data suggest the ratio @xmath16 to be near one , but much more observational work needs to be done to constrain this number . measuring the kinematics in very young clusters would be an extremely important undertaking , because the implications of @xmath22 are dramatic .",
    "to demonstrate these implications it is now assumed that a cluster is born in a very compact state ( @xmath23  pc ) , with a low sfe ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath22 .",
    "as noted in @xcite , `` in the presence of o  stars , explosive gas expulsion may drive early cluster evolution independently of cluster mass '' .",
    "as one of the important implications , a cluster in the age range of @xmath25  myr will have an unphysical @xmath26 ratio because it is out of dynamical equilibrium rather than having an abnormal stellar imf @xcite .",
    "another implication would be that a pleiades - like open cluster would have been born in a very dense onc - type configuration and that , as it evolves , a `` moving - group - i '' is established during the first few dozen  myr comprising roughly 2/3rds of the initial stellar population and expanding outwards with a velocity dispersion which is a function of the pre - gas - expulsion configuration @xcite .",
    "these computations were in fact the first to demonstrate , using high - precision @xmath27-body modelling , that the re - distribution of energy within the cluster during the embedded phase and the expansion phase leads to the formation of a substantial remnant cluster despite the inclusion of all physical effects that are disadvantageous for this to happen ( explosive gas expulsion , galactic tidal field and mass loss from stellar evolution ) .    thus , in this scenario stars form in very compact clusters that have radii less than about 1  pc and masses larger than a dozen  @xmath28 , and in the presence of o  stars the residual gas is removed explosively leading to loss of stars from the cluster which form a moving  group  i ( an expanding population of sibling stars ) . a cluster re - forms after gas expulsion as a result of energy - equipartition during the embedded phase , or during the expanding phase , and fills its roche lobe in the galactic tidal field .",
    "such a cluster appears with an expanded core radius ( compare the onc with about 0.2  pc and the pleiades with 1.3  pc ) and evolves secularly through evaporation until it s demise @xcite .",
    "a `` moving - group - ii '' establishes during this stage as the `` classical '' moving group made - up of stars which slowly diffuse / evaporate out of the re - virialised cluster remnant with relative kinetic energy close to zero . under unfavorable conditions",
    "no cluster re - forms after gas expulsion .",
    "such conditions may arise from time - variable tidal fields ( e.g. through nearby cloud formation ) or simply through unfavorable density profiles just before gas - expulsion @xcite , and they may dominate over the favorable ones (   [ pk_ssec : mass_indep ] ) .",
    "note that the number of stars in moving - group - i always outnumber the number of stars in moving - group - ii , while the unfavourable conditions would lead to no moving - group - ii .",
    "moving - groups - i would be populated by stars that carry the initial kinematical state of the birth configuration into the field of a galaxy .",
    "each generation of star clusters would , according to this picture , produce overlapping moving - groups - i ( and  ii ) , and the overall velocity dispersion of the new field population can be estimated by adding in quadrature all expanding populations .",
    "this involves an integral over the embedded - cluster mass function , @xmath29 , which describes the distribution of the stellar mass content of clusters when they are born @xcite .",
    "it is known to be a power - law @xcite .",
    "the integral can be calculated for a first estimate of the effect .",
    "the result is that for reasonable upper cluster mass limits in the integral , @xmath30 , the observed age  velocity dispersion relation of galactic field stars in the solar neighbourhood can be reproduced .",
    "this theory can thus explain the `` energy deficit '' , namely that the observed kinematical heating of field stars with age can not , until now , be explained by the diffusion of orbits in the galactic disk as a result of scattering on molecular clouds , spiral arms and the bar @xcite .",
    "because the age  velocity - dispersion relation for galactic field stars increases with stellar age , this notion can also be used to map the star - formation history of the milky - way disk by resorting to the observed correlation between the star - formation rate in a galaxy and the maximum star - cluster mass born in the population of young clusters @xcite .",
    "a possible cosmologically - relevant implication of this `` popping - cluster '' model emerges as follows @xcite : a thin galactic disk which experiences a significant star burst such that star clusters with masses ranging up to @xmath31 can form in the disk , will puff - up and obtain a thick - disk made - up of the fast - moving velocity wings of the expanding clusters after residual gas expulsion . a notable example where this process may have lead to thick - disk formation",
    "is the galaxy ugc  1281 @xcite , which , by virtue of its lsb character , could not have obtained its thick disk as a result of a merger with another galaxy .",
    "@xcite observe edge - on disk galaxies with a chain - like morphology in the hst ultra - deep field finding many to have thick disks .",
    "these appear to be derived from kpc - sized clumps of stars .",
    "these clumps are probably massive star - cluster complexes which form in perturbed or intrinsically unstable gas - rich and young galactic disks .",
    "the individual clusters in such complexes would `` pop '' as in the theory above @xcite , leading naturally to thick disks as a result of vigorous early star formation .",
    "another potentially important implication from this theory of the evolution of young clusters is that _ if _ the gas - expulsion time - scale and/or the sfe varies with initial ( embedded ) cluster mass , then an initially featureless power - law mass function of embedded clusters will rapidly evolve to one with peaks , dips and turnovers at `` initial '' cluster masses that characterize changes in the broad physics involved , such as the gas - evacuation time - scale .    _ note _ that the `` embedded '' cluster mass is the birth mass in stellar content , while the `` initial '' cluster mass is the mass of stars the virialised post - gas - expulsion star cluster would have had if it had been born with a sfe of 100  per cent ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "`` initial '' cluster masses are derived by dynamically evolving observed clusters backwards in time to @xmath33 by taking into account stellar evolution and a galactic tidal field but not the birth process (  classical  evolution tracks , eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to further quantify this issue",
    ", @xcite assumed that the function    @xmath34    exists , where @xmath35 is as above , @xmath36 is the `` classical initial cluster mass '' and    @xmath37    thus , for example , for the pleiades , @xmath38 at the present time ( age : about 100  myr ) , and a classical initial model would place the initial cluster mass at @xmath39 by using standard @xmath27-body calculations to quantify the secular evaporation of stars from an initially bound and virialised `` classical '' cluster @xcite . if , however , the sfe was 33  per cent and the gas - expulsion time - scale was comparable or shorter than the cluster dynamical time , then the pleiades would have been born in a compact configuration resembling the onc and with a mass of embedded stars of @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath41 in this particular case .    by postulating that there exist three basic types of embedded clusters , namely    * clusters without o  stars ( type  i : @xmath42 , e.g. taurus - auriga pre - main sequence stellar groups , @xmath43  oph ) , * clusters with a few o  stars ( type  ii : @xmath44 , e.g. the onc ) , and * clusters with many o  stars and with a velocity dispersion comparable to the sound velocity of ionized gas ( type  iii : @xmath45 )",
    ",    it can be argued that @xmath46 for type  i , @xmath47 for type  ii and @xmath46 for type  iii .",
    "the reason for the high @xmath48 values for types  i and  iii is that gas expulsion from these clusters may be longer than the cluster dynamical time because there is no sufficient ionizing radiation for type  i clusters , or the potential well is too deep for the ionized gas to leave ( type  iii clusters ) .",
    "type  i clusters are excavated through the cumulative effects of stellar radiation and outflows , while type  ii clusters probably require multiple supernovae of type  ii to unbind the gas @xcite . according to the present notion ,",
    "type  ii clusters undergo a disruptive evolution and witness a high `` infant mortality rate '' @xcite , therewith being the pre - cursors of ob associations and open galactic clusters .    under these conditions and an assumed inverted gaussian functional form for @xmath49 ,",
    "the power - law embedded cluster mass function transforms into a cluster mass function with a turnover near @xmath0 and a sharp peak near @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "this form is strongly reminiscent of the initial globular cluster mass function which is inferred by e.g. @xcite to be required for a match with the evolved cluster mass function that is seen to have a universal turnover near @xmath0 .",
    "thus , @xmath51  yr - old cluster populations have log - normal gaussian mass functions quite independently of the environment .    in the theory presented here ,",
    "the power - law embedded cluster mass function evolves in the first  @xmath52  yr to the `` initial '' cluster mass function with the broad turn - over near @xmath0 . in this context",
    "it is of interest to note that @xcite found a turnover in the cluster mass function near @xmath0 for clusters with an age near @xmath53  yr in the star - burst galaxy m82 .",
    "this result was challenged , but in their section  2.1 @xcite counter the criticisms .",
    "this age of 1  gyr is too young to be explainable through secular evolution starting from a power - law cluster mass function .",
    "in contrast to this interpretation , the theory outlined here would allow a power - law embedded cluster mass function to evolve to the observed form within 1  gyr .",
    "evaporation through two - body relaxation in a time - variable tidal field then takes over thereby enhancing the observed log - normal shape of the old cluster mass function ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* eg . ) .",
    "this ansatz may thus bear the solution to the long - standing problem that the initial cluster mass function needs to have this turnover , while the observed mass functions of very young clusters are featureless power - law distributions .      if , on the other hand , @xmath54constant such that only about 10  per cent of all clusters survive independently of mass , then the above long - standing problem would remain unsolved .",
    "this situation is suggested by the results of @xcite and @xcite , among others .",
    "observations show that 90  per cent of all very young clusters dissolve within about @xmath55  yr , independently of their mass .",
    "this may either be due to a constant @xmath48 , or , as pointed out by @xcite , a result of 90  per cent of all clusters dissolving and only the rest surviving intact .",
    "the former case would simply imply a constant shift of the power - law mass function along the mass axis to smaller masses as a result of cluster disruption through stellar feedback ( operating in all embedded clusters ) , while the latter would imply a purely stochastic element to the disruption of clusters .",
    "it would therefore appear that this high infant mortality of clusters independently of cluster mass scenario would be in contradiction with the results of @xcite on the m82 1  gyr - old cluster system combined with the observed power - law mass function of very young clusters .",
    "observations show that star clusters of any mass are formed extremely compact ( @xmath18  pc ) , while older clusters appear well distended with radii of a few - to - many  pc .",
    "very young clusters seem to be super - virial , and expanding hii shells also indicate the explosive removal of residual gas . star - cluster formation thus appears to be rather violent leading to a loss of a large fraction of stars and probably in many cases total cluster disruption .",
    "as this discussion shows , the formation process of star clusters may have significant cosmological implications in that the morphology of galaxies may be shaped by the clusters born within them : the disks of galaxies are probably thickened during periods of high star - formation rates while low - mass dwarf galaxies may attain halos of stars as a result of the violent processes associated with cluster birth as a result of which stars may spread outwards with relatively high velocity dispersions .",
    "particular examples of such events have been noted above .",
    "if this is true can be verified by measuring the velocity dispersions of stars in clusters younger than at most a few  myr .",
    "this is very important to do because thickened galactic disks are often taken to be evidence for the merging of cold - dark - matter sub - structures .",
    "naturally , in - falling dwarf galaxies will lead to thickened disks , and counter - rotating thick disks would be prime examples of such processes @xcite , but this discourse shows that sub - pc - scale processes would probably need to be incorporated in any galaxy - evolution study .",
    "the mass function of old globular clusters has a near - universal turnover near @xmath0 which has so far defied an explanation , given that the mass function of very young clusters is observed to be a power - law , and that the modelling of classical disruption through two - body relaxation and tidal fields poses a challenge for evolving a power - law to the approximate log - normal form for old clusters .",
    "again , mass - dependent processes related to the physics of residual gas expulsion can explain such a turnover , but in this case the turnover would have to become evident in cluster populations younger than about 100  myr .",
    "the results of @xcite suggest this to be the case .",
    "the results of @xcite , however , appear to show no such evidence for the cluster population in the antennae galaxies : the mass function for two age groups of clusters ( younger than about 10  myr , and between 10 and 160  myr ) show the same power - law form , albeit with different normalisations as a result of the high infant mortality rate .",
    "if this is true , then orbital anisotropies in the young globular cluster populations as proposed by @xcite would be needed to evolve a power - law mass function to the log - normal form .",
    "it therefore appears that the broad principles of early cluster evolution remain quiet unclear .",
    "given that _",
    "clusters are the fundamental building blocks of galaxies _",
    "@xcite this is no satisfying state of affairs . on the positive side , the importance of star clusters to stellar populations and other cosmological issues ( merging histories of galaxies , galactic morphology ) means that much more theoretical and observational effort is needed to clarify which processes act during the early life of a star cluster , and how these affect its appearance at different times .",
    "i thank the organisers for giving me an opportunity to present this material at this great meeting which was characterised by a wonderful atmosphere of friendship towards henny lamers by all participants ."
