    "bose - einstein condensates loaded into optical lattices , which perfectly realize spatially periodic potentials , represent an exciting field of research in the sense that many simplified toy models of condensed matter physics can be studied in an exceptionally clean manner @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by modern means of atom and quantum optics that allow the experimentalist an unprecedented control of initial conditions in coordinate and momentum space and also of the desired dynamics @xcite .",
    "a paradigm of quantum transport on the microscopic scale is the wannier - stark ( ws ) problem , where particles move in a tilted , but otherwise spatially periodic potential .",
    "the famous bloch oscillations and related phenomena , such as interband tunneling , were observed in experiments with quasi - particles in superlattices @xcite , with light in optical nonlinear media @xcite , and in great detail also with ultracold atoms moving in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "all experimental studies based on the latter realization were performed in a regime where atom - atom interactions are either negligible @xcite or they reduce to a perturbative mean - field effect @xcite .    the regime of strong correlations in the ws system , in which interactions can not be reduced to a mean - field model or even dominate the evolution has been addressed only theoretically up to now @xcite .",
    "state - of - the - art experiments are , however , capable of getting into a regime of filling factors ( i.e. of atoms per lattice site ) of the order one , where interaction - induced correlations are crucial @xcite .    motivated by the experimental progress , we extend previous studies of the asymmetric triple - well @xcite and of the ws problem @xcite . in the present work we give a more comprehensive and quantitative account of our findings briefly reported in @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : oneband ] we introduce our two - bands bose - hubbard ( bh ) model and focus on the dynamics within the first band of the optical lattice .",
    "in contrast to the vast literature which focuses on regimes around mott - insulator like phase transitions in the absence of an additional stark force , see e.g. @xcite , we concentrate on the bh model in the superfluid realm and in the presence of a static tilt .",
    "we characterize the transition between the regular and the chaotic realm of the quantum spectra by a quantitative and systematical analysis based on statistical tests . in section  [ sec : twobands ] we perturbatively include the decay to the second band via landau - zener like tunneling processes . the quantum spectrum of the latter , non - unitary problem is analyzed in section  [ sec : results ] and found to essentially reproduce the properties of the purely one - band approximation down to rather small lattice depths .",
    "the resulting decay rates for the interband tunneling strongly depend on the many - particle nature of the problem and are found to correlate with the transition to the quantum chaotic regime . as a consequence , signatures of many - body quantum chaos are predicted to be accessible to experiments with ultracold atoms over a broad range of parameters , in both `` horizontal '' transport along the lattice and in interband `` vertical '' transport .",
    "our results are finally summarized in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we briefly review the general hamiltonian for a system of spinless , interacting atoms in a quasi - one dimensional optical lattice subjected to a tunable tilting force @xmath0 .",
    "we start out with the purely periodic problem , @xmath1 , in an optical potential of spacing @xmath2 , recoil momentum @xmath3 and typical kinetic energy @xmath4 . the optical potential and the kinetic energy form the single - particle bloch hamiltonian : @xmath5 the eigenfunctions are the bloch waves @xmath6 , labeled by the quasimomentum @xmath7 and the band index @xmath8 @xcite , with dispersion law @xmath9 . in the appendix  [ sec : wannier ] we explain how to use the single - particle solutions @xmath10 to build a set of localized orbitals @xmath11 called wannier functions ( wf ) . in the limit of deep lattices",

    "we obtain the hamiltonian in terms of the creation and annihilation operators @xmath18 , @xmath19 , for a particle in the @xmath13th site and the @xmath8-th energy band of the lattice .",
    "the number operator is @xmath20 .",
    "we restrict the analysis to the first two bands , which can be addressed by experiments @xcite and that can be handled numerically without great difficulties .",
    "the coefficients of the hamiltonian are given by integrals involving the wf : the exact computation of the wf outlined in appendix  [ sec : wannier ] motivates the selection of the operators that are most relevant for @xmath21 .",
    "we are left with the on - site energy @xmath22 , the kinetic energy @xmath23 , and the on - site interaction between atoms in the same band @xmath24 @xcite , for @xmath25 .",
    "moreover we have on - site interaction between atoms in different bands @xmath26 and two transition operators @xmath27 , @xmath28 that are the subject of a detailed analysis in section  [ sec : twobands ] .",
    "the dimension @xmath29 of the hilbert space spanned by the fock states @xmath30 ( defined in appendix  [ sec : floquetbloch ] ) , for a system of @xmath31 bosons distributed over @xmath32 lattice sites , occupying up to the @xmath33nd band of the periodic potential , is given by the combinatorial formula @xmath34 .",
    "the typical number of lattice sites in experiments is @xmath35 and the filling - factor @xmath36 is of order unity @xcite , such that the exponential increase of @xmath29 with the system size limits any exact numerical approach to smaller systems , where we impose the cyclic boundary conditions @xmath37 .",
    "the implementation of these conditions requires the system to be translationally invariant .",
    "the stark potential @xmath38 , however , spoils the periodicity of the bloch hamiltonian eq .   and produces localized ws eigenstates instead of traveling bloch waves @xcite .",
    "we follow @xcite and proceed to eliminate the stark potential from the hamiltonian by changing to the interaction representation ( ir ) with respect to @xmath39 .",
    "the hamiltonian in the ir , @xmath40 , is time - dependent , and the problem becomes conceptually more complicated .",
    "we rescale the energies by @xmath41 , the lengths by @xmath2 , the momenta by @xmath42 and we make the substitutions @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",

    "the `` dipole '' coefficient @xmath50 is given in eq .  .",
    "the hamiltonian of eq .  ,",
    "restricted to the first two bands of the lattice , finally reads in the ir :    @xmath51    in the ir the hamiltonian is again symmetric for discrete translations in space and it has lost the time independence but it is periodic with the bloch period @xmath52 .     the quasienergy levels @xmath53 of the fb operator for a system with @xmath54 , @xmath55 , in the subspace with @xmath56 .",
    "the ws ladder is seen on the left panel , the perturbative splitting of the first rung is magnified in the lower panel . in the upper panel a single linear function of @xmath57 is added to @xmath58 to eliminate an overall winding trend , and allow a better visibility of the avoided crossings .",
    "the parameters of the hamiltoniana are @xmath59 , @xmath60 , as used also in the subsequent figures .",
    "]    we assume that the initial state , for @xmath1 , is superfluid , characterized by the delocalization of the atoms over the entire lattice .",
    "the critical conditions on the parameters , that enforce the superfluid phase in the present context @xcite is @xmath61 . following @xcite , in the present section we set the lattice depth @xmath62 , which gives @xmath63 and the interaction coefficient @xmath64 , with @xmath65 .",
    "the object of the subsequent study is the evolution operator up to the bloch period @xmath66 , called floquet - bloch ( fb ) operator @xcite .",
    "the results presented in the following confirm and extend the results of @xcite .",
    "the discrete translational symmetry of the hamiltonian entails that the fb operator is a block - diagonal matrix in the basis of eq .  , labeled by a many - body quasimomentum @xmath67 .",
    "the dynamics of the atoms in the lattice is complex because many vectors take part in the time evolution of an arbitrary initial state .",
    "the strong mixing of the basis vectors in time means that the evolution of a state is not bound to a small subspace of the total hilbert space ( contrary to @xcite ) , but , after a bloch period , the initial state spreads over the entire hilbert subspace with definite quasimomentum ( e.g. @xmath56 ) .",
    "this is evidenced by the dependence on @xmath0 of the quasienergies @xmath68 , obtained from the eigenvalues @xmath69 of the fb operator .    in the fig .",
    "[ fig : oneband1 ] we show the quasienergy spectrum as the `` control parameter '' @xmath0 is varied . in the limit @xmath70",
    ", we recover the standard bh model ( the analysis of the fb spectrum is here , however , not useful since the bloch period tends to infinity ) . in the regime",
    "where the atomic interactions are negligible with respect to the lattice potential , the single particle bloch picture is adequate and the spectrum is simply a finite band .",
    "for @xmath71 the single - particle ws ladder is found , i.e. a fan of energy levels @xmath72 , @xmath73 integer .",
    "since the interactions are non - zero , the levels are split up and the first order perturbative effect on the ladder was computed in @xcite .",
    "the central ws rung is split into levels which are proportional to the interaction energies of many atoms in a site , @xmath74 .",
    "since the level splittings have the common factor @xmath75 , a collapse and revival of quasimomentum oscillations ( the fock space version of the single - particle bloch oscillations ) was predicted for this parameter range in @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "an irreversible decay of the quasimomentum oscillations was found in the range @xmath76 @xcite , where avoided crossings dominate the spectrum .",
    "these are directly , experimentally observable consequences of the complex level structure presented in fig .  [ fig : oneband1 ] .     the distribution @xmath77 and the @xmath78 ( insets ) for the quasienergy spacings ( stairs ) , the wd ( solid ) and the poisson distribution ( dashed ) .",
    "the parameters are @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 ( left , regular ) and @xmath82 ( right , chaotic ) . ]",
    "the presence of avoided crossings means that a strong mixing of the fock states is necessary to build the eigenstates of the system , and no set of quantum numbers can be assigned to individual levels as @xmath0 varies . in the region of parameters where the energy scales of the system are comparable in magnitude , we can characterize the spectrum in terms of the statistical distribution of the quasienergies spacings and by statistical measures for the eigenfunctions .",
    "the latter have been intensively studied in @xcite . in the following",
    ", we concentrate on the statistical behaviour of the quasienergies , which is closely linked to the behaviour of the open system studied in section  [ sec : twobands ] .    the probability @xmath83 that the magnitude of a given interval spacing @xmath84 is in @xmath85 $ ] is given by the poisson distribution @xmath86 @xcite for an uncorrelated spectrum in the regular regime .",
    "strongly correlated quantum spectra , corresponding to the chaotic regime in our many - particle model , are well modeled by the wigner - dyson ( wd ) distribution for a circular orhogonal ensemble of random matrices @xcite : @xmath87 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : oneband2 ] the probability distribution and the cumulative distribution function ( @xmath78 ) of the quasienergy spacings are shown for two paradigmatic values of @xmath0 .",
    "the presence of avoided crossings in the chaotic case @xmath88 shows up as a depletion of small quasienergy spacings , and the probability to find a level crossing vanishes .",
    "we improved the statistical description of the quasienergy spectrum with further analyses , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oneband3 ] . in the panel (",
    "a ) we quantify the convergence of the quasienergy spacings distribution to the wd profile , thus filling the gap between the two pictures of fig .",
    "[ fig : oneband2 ] .",
    "we computed the fb operator for several values of @xmath0 and confronted each spectrum with the wd distribution using a modified @xmath89 test , computed as follows .",
    "each sequence of levels spacings was algorithmically binned to leave @xmath90 `` observed '' spacings in each bin @xmath91 @xcite . the `` expected '' values @xmath92 are the integrals of the theoretical distributions over the bins and the sum @xmath93 was calculated",

    "the condition for the regular - chaotic transition can be directly read off from the quantitative statistical test results and corresponds , e.g. to @xmath100 .",

    "the solid and dot - dashed lines are the theoretical predictions for the wd and poisson statistics of energy levels , respectively . ]",
    "we found that the profile of the quasienergy spacings distribution changes smoothly , but we used two statistical tests introduced in @xcite ( eq . ( 27 ) and ( 29 ) therein ) to show that the poisson and wd statistics are clearly identified at the borders of the transition .",
    "[ fig : oneband3 ] ( b ) shows the explicit results for the @xmath102 function of @xcite whose predicted linear scaling @xmath103 for the poisson and @xmath104 for the wd expectation is confirmed . in fig .",

    "the logarithmic behaviour clearly prevails over all energy ranges for the chaotic spectrum , only apart from oscillations which are indeed typical for samples of finite size ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we develop a perturbative analysis of the two - bands system of eq .  .",
    "we consider the many - body dynamics within the ground band and the perturbative action of the operators that couple the fock states of the ground band to states in the second band . as a consequence of the interband terms",
    "each fock state @xmath30 ( see appendix  [ sec : floquetbloch ] ) suffers an energy shift @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is its decay width .",
    "the hamiltonian is modified accordingly and becomes a non - hermitian effective hamiltonian for the ground band , that yields a non unitary fb operator . in the following ,",
    "we compute the set of decay widths . in the next section",
    "we then study the spectrum of this new fb operator .",
    "we first define a basis of unperturbed states .",
    "we choose to neglect the hopping in the lower band , where the wf are more strongly localized , so an unperturbed state projected on the hilbert space of @xmath31 particles in the ground band is a fock state @xmath112 . in the second band",
    "we neglect the interactions , since in the perturbative approach only a few particles ( one or two in the following ) populate the excited levels .",
    "so an unperturbed state projected on the second band is the solution of the one - particle ws problem @xcite , i.e. a localized wave function centred at site @xmath113 , written with the bessel function @xmath114 as : @xmath115 or @xmath116 , respectively . in the following ,",

    "the condition on the energy conservation is relaxed to account for the uncertainty @xmath129 of the unperturbed energy levels of the initial and final states . the energy uncertainty and",

    "this follows from the possibility to conserve the energy even if a particle is pushed very far , if the other particle is pushed almost equally far in the opposite direction . since the decay width eq .",

    "now we conclude the computation and derive the energy broadening @xmath129 of the fock states in the ground band necessary to implement the conditions of eq .   and .",
    "in the ground band , the unperturbed hamiltonian consists only of the on - site interaction operator : @xmath147 in the case of a single particle in a periodic potential the use of first order perturbation theory is wrong , as the second order of the perturbation theory diverges because of the exact degeneracy in energy of neighbouring sites , entailed by the translational symmetry of the lattice . on the contrary , in the present case",
    ", the unperturbed hamiltonian is just a rough approximation of the true hamiltonian of the system and the remaining operators are supposed to remove the degeneracies , since the translational symmetry is broken by the external field in the ws picture .",

    "we extended previous work @xcite and verified thoroughly the transition from a regular to a quantum chaotic spectrum , found in @xcite as the stark field is varied .",
    "the transition takes place when the tunneling amplitude in the lattice becomes comparable to the interaction energy of the atoms . in this regime",
    "it is not possible to find a set of quantum numbers that decompose the spectrum into subspaces not mixed by a change of the stark field .",
    "because of the strong mixing of the energy eigenstates , many avoided crossings are found in the spectrum and the statistical analysis of the energy spacings show a characteristic depletion of small spacings - a signature of quantum chaos .",
    "we derived a reasonable two - bands model , on the basis of which we opened the ground band subsystem by a perturbative coupling of the fock states to excited stark states .",
    "we obtained the set of decay rates from the complex - valued quasienergies of the fb operator .",
    "we analyzed the real part of the quasienergies and verified that the transition from the regular to the chaotic regime is still visible and not much modified with respect to the one - band system .",
    "moreover we analyzed the statistical distribution of the imaginary part of the quasienergies , i.e. the decay rates of the states in the ground band .",
    "we found that the distributions of the decay rates become thinner as the regular - chaotic transition is crossed .",
    "we reckon that thinner distributions of the decay rates are a signature of the complex dynamics , where a few strongly decaying states act as leading decay channels .",
    "the statistical characterization of the tunneling rates could be used to compute the expected atomic current from the ground band to the excited band of the lattice , thus providing an experimental probe for the regular - chaotic transition .",
    "time - dependent observables could possibly be computed also with advanced mean - field techniques as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , as long as no full spectral information of the many - body system is wanted .",
    "of course , a deeper investigation is desirable to understand on quantitative grounds the full interplay of the dynamics within the first band and the decay towards higher bands , and a more detailed analysis of the interband coupling will be worthwhile in a full - blown model in which at least two bands are completely included .",
    "our results are a first step in this direction of studies of regimes in which both `` horizontal '' and `` vertical '' quantum transport are simultaneously present and influence each other in a complex manner .",
    "we thank alexey ponomarev , gregor veble , and andrey kolovsky for lively discussions on the wannier - stark system and quantum chaos and yan fyodorov for bringing ref .",

    "the coefficients of the hamiltonian eq .   are given by integrals of the wf @xmath198 , once the expansion of eq .",
    "is substituted into eq .  .",
    "the wf are defined as : @xmath199 from the definition it follows that @xmath200 , so that all the bloch waves for a band can be computed starting from a _ single _ wannier function @xmath201 .",
    "we computed the wf following the method introduced in @xcite .",
    "a bloch wave is factorized as @xmath202 , where the periodic function @xmath203 is expanded in a truncated basis of momenta using multiples of @xmath204 only : @xmath205 using a gauge transform ( @xmath206 ) , an effective hamiltonian for the periodic @xmath207 is derived from eq .  .",
    "we solved the effective schrdinger equation as a linear system for @xmath208 with dispersion law @xmath9 as eigenvalues .",
    "we obtained the on - site energies and the hopping amplitudes from the fourier transform of @xmath9 : @xmath209 the wf is finally computed from the inversion of eq .  .",
    "the relative phase of the eigenvectors @xmath208 , for different quasimomenta , is _ not _ unique . for",
    "the simple case of a sinusoidal lattice potential , the correct choice of the phases can be inferred from @xcite : @xmath210 this phase choice guarantees the correct inversion symmetry @xmath211 of the wf of the first and of the second band , respectively .",
    "the interaction coefficients for eq .   read : @xmath212 the wf are an orthogonal set of functions , so that different bands are decoupled in the one - body dynamics .",
    "the tilting potential @xmath38 has nonvanishing `` dipole '' matrix elements that couples adjacent bands : @xmath213",
    "the fock states @xmath30 are defined by the sequence of occupation numbers @xmath214 for the @xmath32 sites of the lattice , in each band @xmath8 .",
    "the cyclic boundary conditions , @xmath215 allow us to define a shift operator @xmath216 @xcite that translates the occupation numbers of a fock state @xmath217 : @xmath218 the operator @xmath216 naturally decomposes the fock space into equivalence classes of vectors generated by repeated application of @xmath216 onto a `` seed '' vector @xmath219 with @xmath220 such that @xmath221 for all the vectors @xmath222 in the class . a new basis @xmath223 can be introduced for which the many - body quasimomentum @xmath224 ( @xmath225 ) , supplies a convenient label : @xmath226 with the obvious advantage that we can diagonalize separately each block of dimension @xmath227 .",
    "this decomposition not only leads to a substantial numerical simplification but is also of dynamical relevance @xcite .",
    "moreover , we exploited that the hamiltonian matrix is _ sparse _ and we verified that the fraction of the nonzero entries is @xmath228 in the limit of large hilbert spaces @xmath229 .",
    "the column @xmath230 of the fb operator coincides with the column of the coefficients of the basis state of index @xmath230 , evolved in time up to one bloch period .",
    "we used a fourth - order runge - kutta time integrator with adaptive stepsize , tuned in precision by the upper bound @xmath231 of the estimated one - step error @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath231 was chosen to suppress , up to @xmath232 , the well - known exponential instability of the runge - kutta method applied to the schrdinger equation .",
    "the quantity @xmath233 was used to compare different spectra @xmath234 , @xmath235 and we verified the consistency of our computations , finding a power - law self - convergence @xmath236 for a sequence of tests with increasing required precision , @xmath237 . the achieved precision scales with cpu time @xmath238 as @xmath239 .",
