    "the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) had measured puled @xmath0-ray emissions from younger pulsars ( thompson 2004 ) .",
    "the multi - wavelength observations of the @xmath0-ray pulsars have shown that the spectra of the non - thermal emissions extend in @xmath0-ray through optical bands .",
    "the observations have also revealed the pulse profiles in optical through @xmath0-ray bands , and the polarization properties of the pulsed optical emissions from the @xmath0-ray pulsars ( kanbach et al .",
    "2005 ; mignani et al 2007 ) . in the future ,",
    "furthermore , the polarization of the x - rays and @xmath0-rays from the pulsars will probably be able to be measured by ongoing projects ( kamae et al . 2007 ; chang et al .",
    "the multi - wave length observations on the spectrum , the pulse profile and the polarization allow us to perform a comprehensive theoretical discussion for the mechanisms of the particle acceleration and of the non - thermal emission in the pulsar magnetospheres .",
    "the particle acceleration and the non - thermal emission processes in the pulsar magnetosphere have been mainly argued with the polar cap accelerator model ( sturrock 1971 ; ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) and the outer gap accelerator model ( cheng , ho & ruderman 1986a , 1986b ) .",
    "also , the slot gap model ( muslimov and harding 2004 ) , which is an extension model of the polar cap model , was proposed .",
    "all models predict an acceleration of the particles by an electric field parallel to the magnetic field . in the pulsar magnetosphere ,",
    "the accelerating electric field arises in a charge depletion region from the so called goldreich - julian charge density ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) , and the strong acceleration region in the magnetosphere depends on th e model .",
    "the polar cap and the slot gap models predict a strong acceleration within several stellar radii on the polar cap , and the outer gap model predicts a strong acceleration beyond the null charge surface , on which the goldreich - julian charge density becomes zero .",
    "as cgro had observed , most of the @xmath0-ray pulsars have a double peak structure in the pulse profile in @xmath0-ray bands .",
    "the outer gap model has been successful in explaining the observed double peak structure ( romani & yadigaroglu 1995 ) . with the outer gap model ,",
    "the double peak structure is naturally produced as an effect of the aberration and the time delay of the emitted photons by the outgoing particles that move toward the light cylinder , which is defined by the positions , on which the rotating speed with the star is equal to speed of the light .",
    "the axial distance of the light cylinder is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the speed of the light , and @xmath3 is the angular velocity of the neutron star .",
    "because the crab pulsar has the pulse profiles with the double peak structure in whole energy bands , the outer gap model can explain the pulse profiles of the crab pulsar in optical through @xmath0-ray bands ( takata & chang 2007 ) .",
    "furthermore , the outer gap model can explain the observed spectra , and the polarization characteristics in optical bands for the crab pulsar ( cheng et al .",

    "therefore , the outer gap accelerator model has successfully explained the results of the multi - wave length observations for the crab pulsar .    for the vela pulsar , multi - peak structure in pulse profiles in x - ray , uv and",
    "optical bands have been revealed ( harding et al .",
    "2002 ; romani et al .",
    "2005 ) , although the pulse profile in @xmath0-ray bands has two peaks in a single period ( fierro et al .",
    "for example , harding et al .",
    "( 2002 ) analysed rxte data and revealed the pulse profile , which has at least five peaks in a single period . because the two peaks in the five peaks are in phase with the two peaks in the @xmath0-ray bands ,",
    "the two peaks will be explained by the traditional outer gap model with the outward emissions from the outer gap .",
    "however , because other three peaks are not expected by the traditional outer gap model , the origin of the three peaks has not been understood , so far .",
    "the inward emissions emitted by particles accelerated toward stellar surface will give one possibility to explain the unexpected three peaks of pulse profile in the x - ray bands of the vela pulsar .",
    "because the primary particles are produced near the inner boundary of the gap , the ingoing particles feel a small part of whole potential drop in the gap before escaping the gap from the inner boundary , although the outward moving particles can feel whole potential drop before escaping the gap from the outer boundary . in previous studies , therefore , the contribution of the inward emissions on the spectral calculation has been ignored by assuming that its flux is much smaller than that of the outward emissions .",
    "however , it will be true only in the @xmath0-ray bands with the curvature radiation . because main emission mechanism in the x - ray bands will be the synchrotron radiation ,",
    "the inward synchrotron emissions with a stronger magnetic field will be efficient enough to contribute on the observed emissions below @xmath0-ray bands .",
    "although the inward emissions have been consistently dealt in the electrodynamic studies ( takata et al . 2006",
    "; hirotani , 2007 ) , only the outward emissions were taken into account for computing the spectrum .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the spectrum in optical through @xmath0-ray bands by taking into account both inward and outward emissions .",

    "furthermore , we apply the theory to psrs b1706 - 44 and b1951 + 32 to calculate the spectrum , because the properties of optical and x - ray emissions from the two pulsars have not been understood well .    in section  2 ,",

    "the perpendicular momentum to the magnetic field lines quickly decreases via the synchrotron radiation , and its cooling length is much shorter than the gap width .",
    "therefore the synchrotron radiation from the primary particles are efficient only near the pair - creation position , which is around the inner boundary of the gap . on the other hand ,",

    "because the collision angles with the magnetospheric x - ray are not difference between the outer outgoing and ingoing @xmath0-ray photons , the difference of number of the created pairs originates from the difference of the number of the @xmath0-ray photons . because the outgoing @xmath0-rays is more than that the ingoing @xmath0-rays as figure  [ spe1 ] ( the left panel ) shows , more outgoing secondary pairs is produced than the ingoing secondary pairs .",

    "[ gapstr ] shows , the inner boundary of the outer gap is located at the radial distance @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the radial distance to the inner boundary , and is @xmath128 .",
    "then , we assume the three - dimensional gap structure that the inner boundary on every field line , which penetrates the outer gap , is located at the position satisfied the radial distance @xmath129 . because the radial distance to the null charge surface varies with the azimuth @xmath130 , the radial distance to the inner boundary also varies with the azimuth .",
    "the lower boundary of the three - dimension gap is defined by the surface of the last  -open field lines . for the upper boundary , we assume the magnetic surface , of which the polar angle @xmath65 on the polar cap is @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the polar angle of the last  -open field lines .",
    "we assume that the outer gap expands around the rotational axis with the azimuthal angle of @xmath124 .",
    "we note that in this paper we discuss the peak positions , which do not depend the emissivity distribution very well , in the pulse profile by ignoring the distribution of the emissivity .",
    "although we need a more detailed model , which deals the three - dimensional distribution of electric field and of emissivity , to discuss the phase - resolved spectra with the pulse profile , the study of the phase - resolved spectrum is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we can anticipate that the emission direction in the observer frame is coincide with the particle motion .",
    "for example , the particle motion along the field lines in the north hemisphere , is described by @xmath133 , where the plus ( or minus ) sign represents the outgoing ( or ingoing ) particles , @xmath134 is the velocity along the magnetic field line and is determined by the condition @xmath135 , @xmath136 is the unit vector of the magnetic field , for which we adopt a rotating dipole field in the observer frame , @xmath137 is the co - rotating velocity , and @xmath138 is the unit vector of the azimuthal direction . to compute the pulse profile , the emission direction , @xmath139 , is interpreted in terms of the viewing angle @xmath140 and the pulse phase @xmath141 , where @xmath142 and @xmath143 is the azimuthal direction of and the radial distance to the emission point , respectively .",
    "figure  [ map ] shows the emission regions projected onto @xmath144-plane , where we adopt an inclination angle of @xmath93 .",
    "we choose the magnetic surface , of which the polar angle of the footpoint on the stellar surface is given as @xmath145 .",
    "the solid lines in figure  [ map ] are corresponding to the outward emissions , and the dashed lines are corresponding to the inward emissions .",
    "we can expect that the inward emissions also make peaks in the pulse profile ; for example , the peaks due to the inward emissions appear around 0.5  phase and 0.9  phase for the observer with the viewing angle of @xmath146 .",
    "we discuss the expected pulse profile for each energy band .",
    "according to figure  [ spe1 ] , only outward curvature emissions contribute to the spectrum above 10  mev . to calculate the pulse profile in @xmath0-ray bands , therefore",
    ", we take into account the only outward emissions , which take place from the inner boundary to the light cylinder .",
    "figure  [ pulse ] ( the left panel ) shows the expected pulse profile in @xmath0-ray bands with the viewing angle @xmath147 . because only outward emissions contribute to the emissions , we obtain double peak pulse profile , as previous studies have proposed ( romani & yadigaroglu 1995 ; romani 1996 ) .    unlike above 10  mev",
    ", both outgoing and ingoing particles contribute to the spectrum of around 1  kev with the synchrotron emissions as figure  [ spe1 ] shows .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ pulse ] shows the pulse profile , which includes both outward and inward emissions . for the inward emissions",
    ", we restricted the radial distance of the emission region with @xmath148 , where the upper boundary @xmath149 comes from the results of the dynamic model , in which very few ingoing pairs are produced beyond the radial distance @xmath150 .",
    "we expected that the pulse positions of the outward synchrotron emissions are aligned with the phase of the peak above 10  mev ( op1 and op2 in figure  [ pulse ] ) .",
    "the dashed line and the dotted line represent the pulse positions of the inward emissions beyond and below the null charge surface , respectively . as the dashed line shows ,",
    "the inward emissions beyond the null charge surface make another two peaks , which are denoted with ip1 and ip2 in the figure , and the inward emissions below the null charge surface make one peak , which is denoted with ip3 .",
    "therefore , the present model predicts a multi - peak structure of the pulse profile in x - ray bands for the vela pulsar .",
    "we compare the expected peak phases in x - ray bands with the observed peak phases by rxte ( harding et al .",
    "2002 ) , which indicates five peaks in a single period . in rxte observations , the phase of the two peaks , which are denoted pk  1 and pk  2-soft in figure  1 in harding et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , are aligned with the phases of the two peaks in the @xmath0-ray bands . with the present model , these two components of rxte",
    "are explained by the synchrotron radiation of the outgoing particles , which produce two peaks ( op1 and op2 ) relating with the @xmath0-ray pulse profiles . the observed other two peaks , which are denoted pk  2-hard and pk  3 in figure  1 in harding et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , are corresponding to the model peaks denoted with ip1 and ip2 , which come from the synchrotron emissions of the ingoing particles beyond the null surface . remarkably , the present model produces the observed phase - separation ( @xmath151 ) of the two peaks .",
    "rxte pk4 in harding et al .",
    "( 2002 ) will be explained by the inward synchrotron emissions below the null charge surface , which creates a peak ( denoted with ip3 ) in figure  [ pulse ] .",
    "rxte observations show that the phase of pk4 is aligned with the phase of the radio pulse .",
    "the present model also expect that the phase of the ip3 is close to the phase of the radio peak .",
    "polarization studies for the observed radio emissions from the young pulsars indicate that the emission hight of the emission is between 1 and 10 per cent of the light cylinder radius ( johnston & wesberg 2006 ) . for the inclination angle @xmath93 , because the radial distance to the null charge surface on the last open filed lines in the meridional plane is about 10 per cent of the light cylinder , the radio emission region will be located near or below null charge surface for the vela pulsar . for example , if the radio emissions are occurred at the radial distance that 5 per cent of the light radius , the radio pulse will be observed at the pulse phase of @xmath152 for the observer with the viewing angle @xmath147 , as the thick solid circles in figure  [ map ] show .",
    "therefore , there is a possibility that we observe the pulse peak ( ip3 ) from the inward emissions below the null charge at the phase aligned the phase of the radio peak .",
    "although the predicted phase - separation between ip2 and ip3 is smaller than the observed phase - separation of rxte pk3 and pk4 , it may be because the real magnetic field structure around the neutron star will not be exactly described by the rotating dipole field , which was assumed in the present paper .",
    "the pulse peaks , whose phases are in phase with the two - peaks in x - ray band ( rxte pk  1 and pk  2-soft in harding et al . 2005 ) and in @xmath0-ray bands ( op1 and op2 in figure  [ pulse ] ) , disappear in optical / uv bands ( romani et al .",
    "furthermore , a new peak in optical / uv bands is observed at the phase between the phases of op1 and of op2 of figure  [ pulse ] .",
    "we argue that the two peaks related with the higher energy emissions disappear because the primary particles do not contribute to the emissions in optical / uv bands , as figure  [ pulse ] ( left ) shows .",
    "the emissions from the secondary pairs take place at higher altitude than the altitude of the primary emission regions .",
    "in such a case , the phases of the pulse peaks of the outgoing secondary pairs is shifted inside the phases of the peaks produced by the outgoing primary particles .",
    "this may be reason for the shift of the observed first peak in optical / uv bands .",
    "in summary of this section , we have calculated the phase averaged spectrum of the vela pulsar with the two - dimensional electrodynamic outer gap model , and we have explained the observations in optical to @xmath0-ray bands .",
    "we found that both emissions from the outgoing and ingoing parities are required to explain the observed spectrum .",
    "the present model predicts that the curvature radiation of the outgoing primary particles is the major emission process above 10  mev , the outward and inward synchrotron emissions for the primary and secondary particles contribute to the emissions in x - ray bands , and the synchrotron radiation of the secondary particles explains the optical / uv emissions .",
    "we also calculated the pulse profile with a three - dimensional outer - gap model .",
    "the present model predicts the multi - peak pulse profile of rxte observations with the outward and inward emissions .          in this section , we apply the model to psr b1706 - 44 .",
    "psr b1706 - 44 is the twin of the vela pulsar .",
    "the magnetic field strength on the stellar surface and the spin down age of the psr b1706 - 44 are similar to the vela pulsar . however , the spectral behavior above the spectral energy peaks observed by the egret are different .",
    "the egret spectrum of the psr b1706 - 44 extends above 10  gev bands from the energy peak , @xmath153gev , with a larger spectral index than that of the vela pulsar . in the x - ray bands , although chadra and xmm - newton observations have detected the non - thermal emissions , the emission mechanism has not been discussed in detail . because the inclination angle is not constrained well for this pulsar",
    ", we adopt an inclination angle of @xmath93 of the vela pulsar . for the surface x - ray emissions ,",
    "we apply the temperature @xmath154 with the effective radius @xmath155  km ( gotthelf et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "figure  [ b1706spe ] shows the spectrum of the total emissions , which include the emissions for the primary and the secondary particles .",
    "the solid line shows the spectrum of the synchrotron and curvature radiation , and the dashed line represents the spectrum of the inverse  -compton process .",
    "as the solid line shows , the calculated x - ray emissions explain the flux of chandra observations but the predicted spectral index @xmath156 , which is defined by @xmath157 , does not explain the index @xmath158 of chandra observation .",
    "however , the present model is consistent with xmm - newton observation of psr b1706 - 44 , which indicates the spectral index of @xmath156 ( mcgowan et al . 2004 ) .    in @xmath0-ray bands",
    ", the predicted spectrum explains the egret observations below 1  gev very well .",
    "however , the observed spectral slope above 1  gev is not explained by the present model , which predicts the exponential decrease of the flux beyond the spectral peak energy .",
    "the observed harder spectral index beyond the spectral peak energy may be related with the three - dimensional effect which due to that the line of sight of the observer passes the outer gap . also , because egret observed the photons around 10  gev bands with a less sensitivity , it is important to observe the @xmath0-ray emissions around 10  gev with a better sensitivity .",
    "it will be done by glast .",
    "psr b1951 + 32 is one of the older @xmath0-ray pulsars with the spin down age , @xmath159  yr , and has a stellar magnetic field of @xmath160  gauss .",
    "the property of the x - ray emissions of b1951 + 32 is not constrained observationally , because the x - ray and soft @xmath0-ray emissions is so weak .",
    "for example , the x - ray emission property determined by rosat observations ( safi - harb et al .",
    "1995 ) conflicts with the upper limits determined by the rxte and asca observations ( chang & ho 1997 ; chang & guo 2000 ) .",
    "we apply the theory to psr b1951 + 32 to show the predicted spectrum from optical through @xmath0-ray bands with the present model .",
    "we infer the surface x - ray emissions of psr b1951 + 32 from the values of the geminga pulsar , which is a @xmath0-ray pulsar with a similar spin down age , @xmath161  yr , with psr b1951 + 32 . for the geminga pulsar ,",
    "the surface temperature is @xmath162  kev with an effective area @xmath163 ( kargaltsev et al .",
    "2005 ) , which means that the observed thermal emissions are most likely emitted from the bulk of the neutron star surface . for psr b1951 + 32 ,",
    "therefore , we adopt the surface temperature @xmath162  kev with an effective radius @xmath164 .",
    "we use an inclination angle of @xmath93 .",
    "figure  [ b1951spe ] shows the calculated spectrum of the total emissions , which include the emissions for the primary and the secondary particles . the solid line is the spectrum of the synchrotron and the curvature radiation , and the dashed line shows the spectrum of the inverse  -compton process . as the solid line shows",
    ", the present model predicts that the x - ray and soft @xmath0-ray emissions are so week to detect with the present instruments , and the result does not explain the fluxes determined by rosat and comptel . on the other hand , the present result is consistent with the upper limits determined by the rxte and asca observations . above 100  mev",
    ", the model spectrum explains the egret observations , and is consistent with the upper limits determined by whipple and magic observations .",
    "with the rxte observations , harding et al .",
    "( 2002 ) proposed the spectral index @xmath38 , which is defined by @xmath157 , of @xmath165 for the phase - resolved spectrum of the peak ( pk  2-soft in figure  1 of harding et al , 2002 ) , which appears between the two peaks , whose phases are aligned with the peak positions in @xmath0-ray bands . as we discussed in section  [ pulsep ] , the preset model explains emission mechanism of rxte pk  2-soft with the synchrotron emissions of the ingoing particles , which create a peak ( figure  [ pulse ] , ip1 ) in the pulse profile .",
    "although the spectrum in figure  [ spe1 ] is calculated using two - dimensional model , we may be able to read the spectral index of the phase - resolved spectra of the peak ip1 from figure  [ spe1 ] ( from the slope of the thin dashed - dotted line in the right panel ) , which predicts the spectral index @xmath166 for the ip1 emissions .",
    "for the reason of this discrepancy between the spectral indexes of rxte and the present model , we argue that the three - dimensional structure effects the phase - resolved spectrum , and/or that rxte observations might not determine the spectral behavior in the x - ray bands very well due to a bright synchrotron x - ray nebula .",
    "the present model predicts the inward synchrotron emissions for the ingoing primary particles ( figure  [ spe1 ] , the thin dashed line in the left panel ) contribute to the spectrum in hard x - ray and soft @xmath0-ray bands .",
    "therefore it is important to measure the phase - resolved spectra and the pulse profiles of the vela pulsar in the hard x - ray and soft @xmath0-ray bands to see how the phase - resolved spectra and the pulse profiles evolve .",
    "recently , the correlation between the arrival time of the radio emissions and the shape of the non - thermal x - ray pulse profile of the vela pulsar was discovered ( lommen et al .",
    "although the radio emission mechanism has not been understood well , the polarization measurement indicates a correlation between the magnetic field geometry of the polar cap region and the swing of the position angle of the polarization of the radio emissions .",
    "therefore , the polar cap accelerator model as the origin of the radio emissions from the pulsar has been widely accepted .",
    "a magnetospheric model having both the polar cap accelerator and the outer gap accelerator has been proposed upon request to balance between the energy loss rate and the angular momentum loss rate , which is equal to the energy loss rate divided by the angular velocity of the star , of the global magnetosphere ( shibata 1991 ; 1995 ) . although the polar cap accelerator and the outer gap accelerator can not exist on the same magnetic field lines because of the different current directions in the polar cap and outer gap accelerators , the polar cap accelerator affects the outer gap accelerator to obtain the torque balance . according to this model , therefore , even though the non - thermal x - rays originate from the outer gap accelerator ,",
    "some correlations between x - ray emissions and the radio emission are expected .",
    "furthermore , the present model also predicts that the outer gap accelerator affects the polar cap accelerator with the inward emissions , which pass near the stellar surface .",
    "the inward emissions will affect the circumstance around polar cap region through the pair - creation process and/or the scattering process .",
    "unlike the vela pulsar , the crab pulsar has only two peaks in the pule profile in optical through @xmath0-ray bands .",
    "this indicates that the observed emissions of the crab pulsar are dominated by the outward emissions in whole energy bands . for the crab pulsar , the photons above 1  gev emitted via the curvature radiation in the outer gap",
    "are converted into the pairs outside the gap by the pair - creation process by the magnetospheric x - ray photons emitted by the secondary pairs .",
    "outer gap model predicts the synchrotron and the inverse  -compton processes of the secondary pairs explain the observed emissions in optical through @xmath0-ray bands . as we discussed in section  [ spectrum ]",
    "( figure  [ spe1],right ) , the outward synchrotron radiation by the outgoing secondary pairs created by the magnetospheric x - rays is much brighter than the inward synchrotron radiation , because the outgoing @xmath0-rays emitted by the curvature radiation is much more than the ingoing @xmath0-rays . for the crab pulsar , therefore , we can expect that the outgoing secondary pairs produce the observed spectrum with the synchrotron and the inverse  -compton process .",
    "because the flux of the outward emissions of the secondary particles is much ( say one or two order ) larger than that of the inward emissions , the pulse profiles have strong two peaks in a single period in optical through @xmath0-ray bands for the crab pulsar .",
    "although we expect contribution of the inward emissions at off - pulse phase , it must be difficult to separate the tiny flux of the inward emissions from off - pulse outward emissions inside null charge surface and/or from the strong background emissions from the synchrotron nebula .",
