    "<S> the approach followed consist in a factorization of the weak part and the hadronization part into a factor which is common to all the processes . </S>",
    "<S> then what makes the reactions different are some trivial cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements and the weight by which the different pairs of mesons appear in a primary step plus their final state interaction . </S>",
    "<S> these elements are part of the theory and thus , up to a global normalization factor , all the invariant mass distributions are predicted with no free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> comparison is made with the limited experimental information available . </S>",
    "<S> further comparison of these results with coming lhcb measurements will be very valuable to make progress in our understanding of the meson - meson interaction and the nature of the low lying scalar meson resonances , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>"
