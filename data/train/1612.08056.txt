    "the einstein s general relativity ( gr ) is a relativistic theory of gravity where the graviton is a massless spin-2 particle @xcite .",
    "gr is the current description of gravitation in modern physics and has significantly astrophysical implications .",
    "nevertheless , whether there exist a consistent extension of gr by a mass term is a basic challenge of classical field theory , since the open questions such as the old cosmological constant problem and the origin of the late - time acceleration of the universe remain behind the puzzles at the interface between gravity / cosmology and particle physics . in general , by adding generic mass terms for the gravitons on the given background usually brings various instabilities for the gravitational theories , sometimes on the nonlinear level .",
    "a new nonlinear massive gravity theory was proposed by de rham , gabadadze and tolley ( drgt ) @xcite , where the boulware - deser ghost @xcite was eliminated by introducing higher order interaction terms in the action . until now",
    ", a nontrivial black hole solution with a ricci flat horizon in four - dimensional drgt massive gravity has been constructed by vegh @xcite .",
    "the spherically symmetric solutions for drgt were also addressed in @xcite , the corresponding charged black hole solution was found in @xcite , and its bi - gravity extension was found in @xcite . moreover , the charged ads black hole solution in the higher - dimensional drgt massive gravity , and its corresponding thermodynamics and phase structure in the grand canonical and canonical ensembles were also presented in @xcite .",
    "recently , the study of thermodynamics in ads black holes has been generalized to the extended phase space , where the cosmological constant is regarded as a variable and also identified with thermodynamic pressure @xcite @xmath3 in the geometric units @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 stands for the spacetime dimensions and @xmath6 denotes the ads radius . in this case , the variation of the cosmological constant is included in the first law of black hole thermodynamics , which ensures the consistency between the first law of black hole thermodynamics and the smarr formula . in @xcite , it was pointed out that the extended phase space can be interpreted as an rg - flow in the space of field theories , where isotherm curves codify how the number of degrees of freedom @xmath7 ( or the central charge @xmath8 ) runs with the energy scale .",
    "moreover , the variation of cosmological constant could be corresponded to variation of number of the colors in yang - mills theory residing on the boundary spacetime @xcite . in the extended phase space ,",
    "the charged ads black hole admits a more direct and precise coincidence between the first order small / large black holes ( sbh / lbh ) phase transition and the van der waals liquid - gas phase transition , and both systems share the same critical exponents near the critical point @xcite . as a result , the analogy between the charged ads black hole and the van der waals system becomes more complete .",
    "more discussions were found as well in @xcite .    in this direction , some investigations for thermodynamics of ads black holes in the drgt massive gravity have been generalized to the extended phase space @xcite . in these models",
    ", it revealed the existence of first - order sbh / lbh phase transition reminiscent of the liquid / gas transition of the van der waals fluid . on the other hand , the four - dimensional born - infeld - ads @xcite , and higher - dimensional singly spinning ads black holes @xcite have been demonstrated the peculiar behavior of intermediate / small / large black hole phase transitions reminiscent of reentrant phase transitions ( rpts ) observed for multicomponent fluid systems , ferroelectrics , gels , liquid crystals , and binary gases , e.g.,@xcite .",
    "a system undergoes an rpt if a monotonic variation of any thermodynamic quantity results in two ( or more ) phase transitions such that the final state is macroscopically similar to the initial state . in this paper",

    "we discussed this issue in the extended phase space where the cosmological constant appears as the pressure of the thermodynamic system and its conjugate quantity is the thermodynamic volume of the black holes . following the standard thermodynamic techniques , we have written out the equations of state and examined the phase structures . when the coupling coefficients of massive potential satisfy @xmath85 with @xmath61 and @xmath79 , we find that a monotonic lowering of the temperature yields a large - small - large black hole transition , where we refer to the latter `` large '' state as an intermediate black hole ( ibh ) , which is reminiscent of reentrant phase transitions .",
    "moreover , this process is also accompanied by a discontinuity in the global minimum of the gibbs free energy , referred to as a zeroth - order phase transition . for three other cases in table  [ sphericcase ] ,",
    "the usual van der waals like small / large black hole phase transition occur when coupling coefficients of massive potential adopt some proper values in the higher - dimensional spacetime .",
