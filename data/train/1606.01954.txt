    "multiferroics with strong coupling between ferroelectric and ferromagnetic degrees of freedom have attracted intense research effort due to their application potential in tunable multifunctional devices @xcite .",
    "so - called spin - driven ferroelectrics , for which the inversion symmetry is broken in the ferroelectric phase due to the appearance of a particular magnetically ordered state , provide a path to the required coupling @xcite . it was found that spin - driven ferroelectricity can occur in different magnetic materials with different types of magnetic ordering states . in order to understand magnetoelectric ( me ) coupling in spin driven ferroelectrics , three different microscopic models , namely exchange striction model , inverse dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) model and spin - dependent _ p_-_d _ hybridization model , have been proposed to describe the observed ferroelectricity in different spin - driven ferroelectrics @xcite .",
    "the inequivalent exchange striction induced by the symmetry spin exchange interaction between the neighboring spins is considered as the driving force of ferroelectricity for multiferroics with commensurate spin order and low symmetry on the specific chemical lattice , such as ca@xmath2(co , mn)o@xmath3 @xcite and _ _ r__mn@xmath4o@xmath5 ( _ r _ = tb - lu ) @xcite . the inverse dm model arising from the antisymmetric spin exchange interaction between canted spin sites can be used to describe the emergence of ferroelectricity for multiferroics with transverse screw spin configurations , such as _ _ r__mno@xmath2 ( _ r _ = gd , tb , dy ) @xcite and ni@xmath2v@xmath4o@xmath6 @xcite with cycloidal spin order , cocr@xmath4o@xmath0 @xcite and ( sr , ba)@xmath2co@xmath4fe@xmath7o@xmath8 with transverse - conical spin order @xcite . according to inverse dm model , electric polarization is produced through the spin - orbit interaction by displacing anions between two canted magnetic moments .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that multiferroicity around room temperature have been discovered in conical hexaferrite systems @xcite , although the me effect in them is still too small for practical application . unlike exchange striction model and inverse dm model , spin - dependent _ p_-_d _",

    "_ hybridization is cufeo@xmath4 with proper screw spin order @xcite .    given that strong coupling between the magnetic and ferroelectric orders exists intrinsically in spin - driven ferroelectrics , magnetic field control of spontaneous polarization and/or electric field control of the magnetization have been successfully demonstrated in several spin - driven multiferroics @xcite .",
    "moreover , the cross - control between electric and magnetic dipoles in multiferroics is found to be accompanied by the dynamical motion of multiferroic domain walls @xcite .",
    "in addition , the dynamic magnetoelectric coupling in multiferroics will lead to the appearance of electric - dipole - active magnetic resonance , i.e. a novel collective excitation named electromagnon @xcite .",
    "the identification of an electromagnon by terahertz spectroscopy and neutron scattering confirmed the existence of this dynamical magnetoelectric coupling @xcite .",
    "as a prototypical multiferroic material with spiral magnetic order , mnwo@xmath0 has been widely studied concerning its magnetic and ferroelectric properties @xcite .",
    "it is well accepted that the inverse dm mechanism is relevant for modeling the me coupling in mnwo@xmath0 .",
    "similar to the case of multiferroic tbmno@xmath2 , the magnetically induced electric polarization in mnwo@xmath0 fulfills the relation : @xmath9 here _ a _ is a coupling coefficient and @xmath10 is the unit vector connecting two neighboring mn moments @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "however , it is argued that dm interaction is not the only driving force for the ferroelectric polarization , other single - site symmetric interactions are also shown to be involved in the magnetoelectric process in mnwo@xmath0 @xcite . besides , a theoretical study suggests a more complex scenario where multiferroicity in mnwo@xmath0 is caused by a competition of dm and isotropic exchange interactions @xcite .",
    "a deeper insight into the coupling between the electric and magnetic degrees of freedom can be gained by studying not only the respective order but also the excitation spectra .    in this paper , we report the observation of elementary magnetic excitations in multiferroic mnwo@xmath0 by high resolution inelastic neutron scattering .",
    "a detailed analysis of the low - energy excitations of mnwo@xmath0 shows that the spin - wave excitations in the collinear antiferromagnetic / paraelectric phase can be well described by a heisenberg model with magnetic exchange couplings extending to the 12@xmath1 nearest neighbor , although mnwo@xmath0 was considered as a moderately spin frustrated system .",

    "in the present work the observed two modes @xmath57 and @xmath58 are all below 0.6 mev . nevertheless , it is impossible for us to identify the character of the low - lying energy modes from unpolarized neutron spectroscopy results .",

    "full multiplet calculation shows that the magnetic anisotropy in mnwo@xmath0 arises from the spin - orbit coupling and it is comparable in energy to the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions @xcite .",
    "compared to the spin - wave energy gap , the energy gaps of 0.07(1 ) mev and 0.45(1 ) mev for the two observed electromagnon excitations are relatively small , but of the same order of amplitude .",
    "if the inverse dm interaction is considered as the mechanism responsible for the multiferroic properties in mnwo@xmath0 , the observed electromagnon excitations , which are associated with the magnetoelectric coupling , may arise from the dm exchange interaction instead of the heisenberg interaction . moreover , although the two observed electromagnon excitation modes can not be described within the heisenberg model , they do exhibit dispersive behavior characteristic for collective excitations . as shown in fig .",

    "further experimental works via complementary techniques and comprehensive dynamical structure calculations are required to get further insight into the nature of electromagnon excitations .",
    "it is also known that the application of magnetic field along the easy - axis of mnwo@xmath0 will lead to a switch of the polarization accompanied with the magnetic phase transition @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to investigate the evolution of electromagnon excitations upon the application of magnetic field in mnwo@xmath0 .",
    "the behavior of electromagnon excitations across the field - induced transition between ferroelectric and paraelectric phases can be helpful to identify the character of electromagnon excitations @xcite , thus leading to a better understanding of the mechanism of magnetoelectric coupling in multiferroics with noncollinear spiral magnetic structure .",
    "in summary , we present results of a comprehensive neutron scattering study of the elementary magnetic excitations in multiferroic mnwo@xmath0 .",

    "the spin - wave gap of 0.61(1 ) mev at 1.5 k amounts to roughly 1/4 of the zone boundary spin - wave energy .",
    "this relatively large value indicates the existence of rather strong spin - orbit interaction , despite the fact that mn@xmath13 is an _ s_-state ion .",
    "the analysis of the low - energy excitation spectra implies the existence of collective electromagnon excitations , which reflect the strong me coupling .",
