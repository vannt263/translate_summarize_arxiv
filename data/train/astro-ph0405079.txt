    "recent analyses of the kinematics and stellar populations of faint distant galaxies up to redshifts of @xmath3 have put strong observational constraints on galaxy formation models . the weak evolution seen in the tight correlation of the distance independent parameters mg ",
    "absorption and velocity dispersion , @xmath2 , at @xmath4 is evidence for a high redshift ( @xmath5 ) of formation for the bulk of the stars in cluster ellipticals ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "further support gives the small increase of the @xmath6-band luminosity derived from the faber ",
    "jackson relation ( @xmath7 _ vs. _ @xmath2 ) .",
    "the combination of structural ( size and surface brightness ) and kinematic ( @xmath2 ) parameters in the fundamental plane ( @xcite ) let us investigate not only the luminosity but also the mass evolution of early  type galaxies .",
    "most previous studies of the fundamental plane ( fp ) at @xmath8 revealed that the mass - to - light ratio of luminous galaxies evolves only mild in accordance with passive evolution models ( @xcite ; @xcite ; see also contribution by fritz & ziegler in this volume ) .",
    "however , these observational results apply only to the special environment of dense rich clusters .",
    "semi - analytic cdm models predict a hierarchical assembly for galaxies through merging of subunits and replenishment of gas from their halos ( @xcite ) . only in the richest clusters galaxies experienced their last major merger at @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the population of early - type galaxies should be more diverse in lower density regions .    for this reason ,",
    "we analyse the evolutionary status of early  type ( e+s0 ) galaxies in poor clusters at a look - back time of @xmath1gyrs with the same quantitative methods as was done in rich clusters .",
    "the mg@xmath2 relation will reveal whether there is more spread in the age / metallicity distribution than in rich clusters at similar epochs , e.g. , in abell2218 ( @xcite ) or abell2390 ( @xcite ) .",
    "results on the fp will give insights whether the mass / structure evolution is more consistent with the monolithic or the hierarchical formation scenario .",
    "we use @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this investigation is an intensive observational campaign to study the evolutionary status of galaxies in 10 poor clusters at intermediate redshifts of @xmath14 selected to have very low x - ray luminosities ( @xmath15  erg / s ) , 100 times lower than the cnoc clusters , and poor optical richness class .",
    "it comprises ground - based optical and nir photometry , medium - resolution multi - object spectroscopy , and _",
    "hst / f702w _ imaging .",
    "the clusters are dominated by passive galaxies with no or little on - going star formation ( sf ) .",
    "the fraction of emission - line galaxies ( elg ) is as low as in the rich x  ray bright cnoc clusters at similar epochs ( @xmath16 ) and at variance with the field value ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "this indicates that processes heavily depending on density like ram  pressure stripping can not be the dominant mechanisms responsible for the supression of sf ( @xcite ) .",
    "analysis of the _ hst _ images for all ten clusters revealed that the overall properties of these cluster galaxies are similar to those in more massive clusters with a low fraction of disk galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spectroscopic observations have been gained during eleven nights ( 04/2001 and 02/2002 ) with the mosca spectrograph at the calar alto observatory ( spain ) .",
    "a summary of the cluster sample with the mean redshifts , number of objects on a mask and total exposure times for spectroscopy is given in tab.[tab : samp ] .",
    "early - type cluster members have been selected based on our low - resolution spectra and from their _ hst _ morphology . for the fp study , we obtained spectra of 5@xmath187 galaxies lying within the _ hst _ fields in a single mos mask .",
    "five masks ( one per cluster ; cl1701 and",
    "cl1702 only observed with one mask ) have been observed to construct a combined fp sample of @xmath1930 galaxies , comparable to that of a single rich cluster ( @xcite ) . outside",
