    "[ fig1 ]    the gaia mission has been approved to provide for the first time a clear picture of the formation , structure , evolution , and future of the entire milky way .",
    "in addition , as secondary goals , gaia will contribute to many other branches of astrophysics , especially stellar and solar system minor body astrophysics , with a valuable contribution to cosmology and fundamental physics .",
    "this clear scientific prioritisation must drive the design , and all compromises .",
    "understanding the structure and evolution of the galaxy requires three complementary observational approaches : * carrying out a full census of all the objects in a large , representative , part of the galaxy ; * mapping quantitatively the spatial structure of the galaxy ; * measuring the motions of objects in three - dimensions to determine the gravitational field and the stellar orbits . in other words ,",
    "what is required are complementary measurements of distances ( astrometry ) , photometry to determine both extinction and intrinsic stellar properties , and the radial velocities along our line of sight .",
    "detailed studies of the local group are the key specific test of our understanding of the formation and growth of structure in the universe .",
    "the most significant questions here relevant for gaia include the history of most of the stars in the galaxy : the nature of the inner galactic disk and the galactic bulge : what are their age , abundance and assembly histories ?",
    "stellar studies locally of course are of critical general significance : only locally can we determine the stellar initial mass function directly .",
    "this function directly controls the chemical and luminosity evolution of the universe .",
    "galactic satellite galaxies are proving the most suitable environs to quantify the nature and distribution of dark matter , and to test the small scale predictions of hierarchical galaxy formation models .",
    "the galactic disk itself , of course , is a key test of angular momentum distributions ( figure  1 ) , chemical evolution , and merger histories , and must eventually provide the most robust information on cold dark matter .",
    "such issues as the number of local dwarf galaxies and the inner cdm profiles of the dsphs are well known demanding challenges for cdm models .",
    "other local group information is also important : what is the stellar initial mass function , what is the distribution of chemical elements , what is the age range in the galactic bulge , when did the last significant disk merger happen ... ?",
    "all these challenge our appreciation of galaxy formation and evolution , and in turn provide the information needed to refine the models .",
    "the partnership between local observations and _ ab initio _ theory is close , and developing well , and must culminate in gaia .",
    "there are clear similarities and distinctions between fundamental properties of the different galactic stellar populations , such as age , metallicity , star formation history , angular momentum ( figure  1 ) which allow study of their individual histories .",
    "this is arguably one of the greatest advantages of studies of local group galaxies : one is able to disentangle the many different histories which have led to a galaxy typical of those which dominate the luminosity density of the universe .",
    "ninety percent of the matter in the universe is of an unknown nature ( to say nothing here of the even larger amount of dark energy ) .",
    "this matter dominates gravitational potential wells in the early universe on all scales , and everywhere except in the centres of large galaxies and dense stellar clusters today .",
    "the smallest scale lengths on which this dark matter is dominant are an important constraint on its nature : for example , if dark matter is concentrated on very small scale lengths it can not be relativistic . the only known way in which we can study dark matter is through its dynamical effects on test particles orbiting in a potential which it generates . the simplest dark - matter dominated systems known , with scale lengths of interest to constrain the physical nature of the dark matter , and with a dynamical structure simple enough to be amenable to understanding , are the galactic satellite dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "very extensive studies , using gravitational lensing , galaxy rotation curves , stellar and gas kinematics , x - ray profiles , and so on , have initiated mapping dark matter on larger scales . for the dwarf galaxies , stellar kinematics are uniquely the method of choice .",
    "this dark matter dominates the matter in the universe , but remains weakly constrained : what is the nature of the dark matter ?",
    "a variety of theoretical studies suggest that the small scale structure of dark matter is the key test of its nature ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ; klypin etal 1999 ; moore etal 1999 ) .",
    "many extant studies of dark matter on many different scale lengths are available , using techniques such as gravitational lensing , x - ray luminosity and temperature profiles , hi and h@xmath0 rotation curves , and stellar dynamics .",
    "none has been able to provide a reliable study of dark matter on the crucial small length scales , because the only small dark - matter dominated relatively simple dynamical systems , the milky way satellite dwarf galaxies , can be studied in detail only with very accurate kinematics of faint stars .      to be confined on small scales ,",
    "a system must be cold . for self - gravitating systems the virial velocity , and equivalently virial temperature , of a system in equilibrium is simply related to its mean density , @xmath1 , and characteristic radius , @xmath2 , as @xmath3    baryonic material , which can radiate away energy while gaseous , can form systems of a wide range of virial velocities , with the lower limit just set by the cooling law . in particular ,",
    "baryonic dark matter could form dark haloes of small scalelength .",
    "one can relate the ` temperature ' of non - baryonic dark matter ( assumed in thermal equilibrium in the early universe ) with its velocity dispersion at the epoch in the early universe when it decouples from the ordinary matter ( bond & szalay 1983 ) . `",
    "hot ' dark matter , for example a massive neutrino , which is relativistic at this epoch , has a large free - streaming length and can not be confined on small scales ( bond , szalay & white 1983 ) . in contrast , ` cold ' dark matter , which is non - relativistic when it decouples from ordinary matter , can form small - scale structure .",
    "one currently popular non - baryonic cold dark matter candidate , the axion , is not produced through processes in thermal equilibrium , has an extremely low ` temperature ' , and can cluster on scales below that of even a dwarf galaxy .",
    "thus the study of dark matter in systems with the smallest characteristic radius provides a thermometer of dark matter and can be used to determine its nature .",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies have ( stellar ) scale - lengths of @xmath4  pc ( irwin & hatzidimitriou 1995 ) , comparable to the scale height of the galactic thin disk and bulge . numerical simulations of cosmological structure formation do not have the dynamic range necessary to study such scales .",
    "irrespective of the future developments of computing power and techniques , the simulation of a dwarf galaxy requires the inclusion of the unknown physics of star formation and feedback , expected to be particularly important in these low velocity - dispersion systems ( e.g. dekel & silk 1986 ; wyse & silk 1985 ; lin & murray 1991 ) .",
    "improved understanding must be led by observations .    what are the smallest systems for which there is evidence of dark matter ? galactic disks are thin , of small scale - height , and we are located in the middle of one .",
    "dark matter confined to the disk ( as distinct from the extended , galactic - scale dark halo ) would be ` cold ' . however , the local neighbourhood is not a good place to study cold disk dark matter , since it is now accepted there is no evidence that any exists ( kuijken & gilmore 1989 , 1991 ; gilmore , wyse & kuijken 1989 ; flynn & fuchs 1994 ; creze etal .",
    "1998 ; holmberg & flynn 2000 ) .",
    "globular clusters are fairly nearby , and have very small scalelengths , tens of parsecs , but again there is no evidence for dark matter associated with globular clusters ( e.g. meylan & heggie 1997 ) .",
    "note that in fact in these two cases there is not just lack of evidence for cold dark matter , there is actual evidence for a lack of dark matter , which in itself is significant .",
    "in contrast , the dark matter content of low - luminosity dwarf galaxies , as inferred from analyses of their internal stellar and gas kinematics , makes them the most dark - matter - dominated galaxies ( e.g. mateo 1998 ; carignan & beaulieu 1989 ) . of these small galaxies ,",
    "the low - luminosity gas - free dwarf spheroidals ( dsph ) are the most extreme .",
    "available stellar kinematic studies provide strong evidence for the presence of dominant dark matter ( e.g. review of mateo 1998 ) , confirming earlier inferences from estimates of the dsph s tidal radii and a model of the milky way gravitational potential ( faber & lin 1983 ) .",
    "substantial analytic methodologies have been developed over the last few years by several groups to interpret colour - magnitude data and stellar kinematics .",
    "these studies provide an existence theorem proving that efficient analysis of the gaia and complementary data is possible .",
    "adequate kinematic data can determine the potential well locally on a variety of different scales , parsecs up to 1mpc .",
    "the motivation is that the _ smallest _ scale is set by a fundamental characteristic of the dark matter , its velocity dispersion , analogously its temperature , so that study of the dynamics on these scales provides unique and strong constraints on the nature of dark matter .",
    "such a determination is possible  and is possible only  using full 6-dimensional phase space data , such as will be determinable by gaia .",
    "the dynamical structure of a dwarf galaxy , while simple , is not trivial .",
    "the galaxies are probably triaxial , can sustain complex families of anisotropic orbits , and live in a time - varying galactic tidal field .",
    "given this complexity , considerable information is required to derive a robust measurement of the 3-dimensional gravitational potential , and hence the generating ( dark ) mass .",
    "several groups have devised methods to explore the possible dynamical structure of a galactic satellite , and used these to simulate observational approaches to determination of the mass distribution .",
    "these studies show that determination of at least five phase space coordinates  two projected spatial coordinates , and all three components of the velocity  are necessary and sufficient to provide a robust and reliable determination of a dark matter mass distribution .",
    "acquisition of these data are possible only with a combination of radial velocity data and proper motion data for a well - selected sample of stars distributed across the whole face of the target galaxy . in the nearest appropriate target galaxies , draco and ursa minor , the stars of interest are at magnitude v@xmath5 , and the required proper motion accuracy , corresponding to 1 - 2 km / s in velocity , is 36@xmath6yr@xmath7 .",
    "thus this specific test of the nature of matter on small scales is better with sim rather than gaia .",
    "nonetheless , the analysis principles apply in general , and can be generalised to gaia studies of the local galaxy , where sim can not contribute .",
    "an important simplification in any dynamical analysis is that the potential be time - independent over an internal dynamical timescale , the tracer stellar distribution be in equilibrium with the potential , and be well - mixed ( relaxed ) . while dsph galaxies show every possible star formation history , it is a defining characteristic that star formation ceased at least a few gyr ago ( e.g. hernandez , gilmore & valls - gabaud 2000 ) .",
    "the internal dynamical times of these galaxies are typically only @xmath8  yr ; thus star formation indeed ceased many hundreds of crossing times ago and the systems should be well - mixed .",
    "this assumption can of course be directly tested by the data .",
    "most studies of galactic dynamics have been impeded by the degeneracy between anisotropy and mass .",
    "this degeneracy , that one can not distinguish between gravitational potential gradients and gradients in orbital anisotropy from measurements of just one component of the velocity ellipsoid ( radial velocity ) , is the fundamental limitation in extant analyses , and the key justification for extending observation to 5 phase space coordinates .",
    "the large observed central radial velocity dispersion is compatible with either a massive halo , and a low central density ; or no halo , and a large central density . to demonstrate our ability to discern between these possibilities , wilkinson etal ( 2002 )",
    "constructed a set of models that span the space of halo mass and anisotropy , and perform monte carlo recoveries of the input anisotropy and halo mass .",
    "they assume that the luminosity density of a dsph is given by a plummer model @xmath9 where @xmath10 is determined by the total observed luminosity .",
    "next , assume that the potential of the system has the form @xmath11    for this dark matter potential , @xmath12 corresponds to a mass  follows  light plummer potential , keplerian at large radii ; @xmath13 yields , for large @xmath14 , a flat rotation curve ; and @xmath15 gives a harmonic oscilator potential . as the parameter @xmath0 decreases , the dsph becomes more and more dark matter dominated .",
    "finally , assume that the distribution function ( df ) of the stars in the model potential is a function entirely of the energy @xmath16 and norm of the angular momentum @xmath17 .",
    "under this assumption , one can derive a two parameter set of dfs , parameterised by @xmath0 and an anisotropy parameter @xmath18 , namely @xmath19 this formula holds for @xmath20 and @xmath21 ; similar expressions can be derived for all the other cases . these dfs generalise earlier calculations by dejonghe ( 1987 ) , which are restricted to the case where there is no dark matter . in terms of binney",
    "s anisotropy parameter @xmath22 , the radial and tangential velocity dispersions @xmath23 and @xmath24 vary as @xmath25    the potential normalisation @xmath26 in eqn  2 is a well defined function of the observed central radial velocity dispersion , and the assumed @xmath0 and @xmath18 .",
    "figure  2 shows the variation of the central and large  scale mass to light ratio as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath18 .    to simulate our ability to resolve among values of @xmath18 and @xmath0",
    ", we generate 6d phase space coordinates @xmath27 drawn from the df @xmath28 , discard the @xmath29 ( geocentric radial position ) coordinate , and attempt to recover @xmath18 and @xmath0 using a bayesian likelihood technique ( see e.g. little & tremaine 1987 , kochanek 1996 , wilkinson & evans 1999 , van der marel etal 2000 ) .",
    "specifically , we scan a grid of @xmath30 , and at each point compute the probability of observing the input data set @xmath31 by bayes s theorem , and the assumption of uniform prior probabilities of @xmath30 , the most likely @xmath30 are given by maximising eqn  5 .",
    "confidence regions are obtained by applying 2d @xmath32 statistics to the logarithm of eqn  5 .",
    "figure  3 ( left ) shows the result of a monte carlo simulation to recover the input @xmath0 and @xmath22 of two model distributions ( @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , respectively ) .",
    "these values of @xmath0 and @xmath18 lie along the direction of the usual mass / anisotropy indeterminacy , and thus illustrate our ability to break this degeneracy .",
    "both model fits involve 800 reconstructions , each of which contains an ensemble of 250 simulated stars .",
    "the right panel of figure  3 depicts constraints placed on the central @xmath35 , and the total @xmath35 within four plummer radii .",
    "although the two models evaluated have a similar total mass within @xmath36 , our method clearly recovers the significant difference in central @xmath35 caused by a halo .",
    "the top two panels of figure  4 illustrate the effect of anticipated velocity measurement errors which are 10% and 20% of the internal ( local ) velocity dispersion of the ( sub-)system under study , assuming a 250 star sample .",
    "these errors cause a systematic displacement of the best ",
    "fit @xmath0 in the small halo ( @xmath37 ) case we examine , because they create a significant increase of the apparent velocity dispersion at the maximum radius ( @xmath38 ) considered .",
    "however , the width of the distribution remains narrow , and the systematic @xmath0 shift will be rigorously incorporated into the analysis by convolving the velocity errors with the df .",
    "larger errors would not be acceptable , however , because resolving among @xmath0 values requires a precise determination of the falloff of the velocity dispersion .",
    "the third panel of figure  4 illustrates the recovery of @xmath30 using only 25 velocities ; the halo and anisotropy are essentially unconstrained by this small sample .",
    "the bottom panel shows the effect of using 750 purely radial velocities , with zero errors .",
    "although we have the same number of one  dimensional velocities as in the 250 star cases , we are unable to recover @xmath0 and @xmath18 ; this failure indicates that the analysis requires all three velocity components , and this work could not be performed using ground  based radial velocities .",
    "a triaxial spheroid seen projected on the plane of sky mimics a rotationally symmetric ellipse .",
    "triaxial systems can support much more complex orbital structures than can 2-d systems ; this allows a degeneracy between radially - dependent orbital complexity and system shape , potentially invalidating dynamical analyses .",
    "more complex modelling is required in this case , and has been partially developed .",
    "the ( very obvious ! ) conclusion from extensive numerical simulations based on those triaxial models is that it is vital to have full kinematics available if we are to investigate triaxial ( more generally : not isolated spherical ) systems .",
    "the discussion above illustrates the considerable progress in quantitative analyses of stellar kinematics which are currently under development .",
    "the introduction recalled that gaia is funded to study galactic evolution .",
    "what data must gaia provide so these analysis techniques can deliver this science .",
    "the quantitative analysis techniques need distances , 2-d ( better 3-d ) kinematics , and some astrophysical information on the distribution function of stellar properties .",
    "highly detailed information on a few stars is not what is needed .",
    "can gaia deliver ?",
    "simulations presented at this meeting show gaia radial velocity data will be unable to provide useful scientific data at low galactic latitudes .",
    "low galactic latitudes , while `` only '' a few percent of sky , contain most of the stars , and contain all of the inner disk and bulge .",
    "it is worth emphasising that these parts of the milky way are the only parts of high redshift galaxies which we can see .",
    "if gaia fails to provide adequate data on these low latitudes , it fails a primary science goal .    however , as the simulations show , bad data are useless .",
    "the lesson for gaia spectra is clear : do something excellently , not several things badly , optimise for the faintest possible stars in uncrowded regions : leave low latitudes for the other instruments .",
    "what other instruments ?",
    "the medium band photometr ( mbp ) unfortunately has been degraded to poor ground - based quality spatial resolution ,  1arcsec .",
    "thus , as long experience has establsihed , mbp will also be of little or no value in the inner galaxy .",
    "again , the implication is clear : optimise mbp for relatively low extinction higher - latitude regions , with somewhat metal - poor old stars .",
    "can gaia meets its primary science goals at all : only if the broad band filters are optimised to deliver the essential minimum astrophysical data .",
    "that is , the limited sensitivity of rvs and the poor resolution of mbp require that the broad band filters be optimised for astrophysical analyses , and not other considerations . without these choices ,",
    "gaai will fail to meet its design science goals . with them",
    ", it will revolutionise our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution ."
