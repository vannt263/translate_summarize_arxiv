    "in guth s original proposal for old inflation @xcite , a false vacuum with the geometry of de sitter space decays through the nucleation as the result of quantum tunnelling of critical bubbles filled with the true vacuum , presumably minkowski space or very nearly so .",
    "the dynamics of false vacuum decay , which had been elucidated by a number of authors @xcite , may be characterized by the dimensionless parameter @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the hubble constant in the false vacuum and @xmath4 is the total number of spatial dimensions , here @xmath5 ) .",
    "the original ` old ' inflation envisaged by guth was unsuccessful because of the presence of two conflicting requirements .",
    "on the one hand , for inflation to solve the horizon problem , to smooth out whatever inhomogeneities may have existed initially , and to sweep away the primordial monopoles , @xmath2 must be small . yet for inflation to end through the percolation of a large number of small bubbles , as guth had originally envisaged , @xmath2 had to be large .",
    "although this potential conflict is noted in guth s first paper , it was not until the more detailed work of guth and weinberg@xcite that this incompatibility was quantitatively and definitively established .",
    "although this deficiency of ` old inflation ' was remedied in the work of linde@xcite and of albrecht and steinhardt @xcite in ` new ' and ` chaotic ' inflation by dispensing with bubbles altogether , with inflation ending through the ` slow roll ' of a scalar field along a relatively flat potential , the idea of inflation with bubbles re - emerges in ` open inflation ' @xcite , where re - heating occurs through the evolution of the inflaton field within the bubble interior . in this case",
    "@xmath2 is so small that ony a single bubble is contemplated .",
    "more recently , the collision of an isolated pair of true vacuum bubbles filled with ( 4 + 1)-dimensional anti de sitter space expanding within a false vacuum of ( 4 + 1)-dimensional de sitter space has been proposed as a mechanism for setting up a randall - sundrum - like @xcite cosmology @xcite with well defined initial conditions @xcite .",
    "a successful braneworld cosmology must resolve the ( 4 + 1)-dimensional smoothness problem @xcite  that is , explain why the bulk geometry ( and any additional fields in the bulk as well ) respect the same three - dimensional spatial homogeneity and isotropy as the universe on the brane .",
    "it does not suffice to postulate an epoch of quasi - exponential expansion on the brane itself , because after such an inflationary epoch ends , through their gravitational coupling , imperfections in the bulk will inevitably induce inhomogeneities on the brane . because anti de sitter space , quite in contrast to de sitter space , does not lose its hair  the amplitudes of perturbations remain constant rather than decay  some other mechanism to explain the spatial homogeneity and isotropy of the bulk , and to establish a preferred initial quantum state is required .    in the colliding bubble braneworld scenario , an initial ( 4 + 1)-dimensional de sitter epoch sweeps away whatever",
    "inhomogeneities may have previously existed . after a modest number of expansion times",
    ", the quantum fluctuations about the classical vacuum rapidly approach the bunch - davies vacuum @xcite .",
    "classically , the nucleation of a single true vacuum bubble breaks the @xmath6 symmetry of @xmath7 to @xmath8 the subgroup of transformations that leave the nucleation center of the bubble invariant . for the case of two bubbles ,",
    "this residual symmetry is further broken to @xmath9@xcite the subgroup of those transformations that leave both nucleation centers invariant .",
    "the three - dimensional , completely spatial surface of bubble collision , from which our local brane endowed with a modified ( 3 + 1)-dimensional flrw cosmology arises , is endowed with the geometry of @xmath10 of constant negative spatial curvature .",
    "owing to the negative spatial curvature of this geometry , the eventual fate of such a universe ( in the absence of a non - vanishing cosmological constant or something similar ) is that of an empty expanding universe whose expansion is predominantly driven by its spatial curvature , as in a milne universe .",
    "however , because of the exponential suppression of the nucleation of bubbles , this dreary fate may lie far in our future .",
    "it is not difficult to envisage bubble separations so large that today the spatial curvature is still negligible .",
    "@xmath11 the cosmological density parameter today ( when @xmath12 ) , is a monotonically increasing function of the bubble pair separation .",
    "the farther apart the bubbles , the larger @xmath13 and the smaller the spatial curvature on the surface of collision . the radius of spatial curvature of the surface of collision is given by@xcite r = h_ds^-1 , which diverges as @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the spatial geodesic separation between the nucleation centers in units where @xmath16 so that @xmath17 corresponds to bubble separated exactly at the threshold of never striking each other .",
    "we observe that even though @xmath15 for colliding bubbles is bounded from above by a finite limit , the surface of collision can be arbitrarily close to flat .",
    "the gamma factor @xmath18 of the colliding bubbles in the local center - of - mass frame of the collision , which is equal to _ max=. where @xmath19 is the radius of the critical bubble ( in units in which @xmath20 however , is limited by a finite upper bound .",
    "both effects drive @xmath21 toward unity as @xmath22 the precise relationship between @xmath15 and @xmath21 depends on the details of the equation of state after the collision , which is unknown and model dependent .    in the colliding bubble scenario",
    "the value of @xmath23 today is a random variable dependent on the interbubble separation which is stochastically determined .",
    "the object of this article is to study the distribution of the interbubble separations for the case of bubbles nucleating in de sitter space .",
    "we now compute the probability distribution for the interbubble separation of pairs of colliding bubbles . this separation @xmath15 is defined in a coordinate free manner as the length of the ( shortest ) spacelike geodesic connecting the nucleation centers of the two colliding bubbles .",
    "we adopt units in which @xmath24 and assume a spatially and temporally uniform nucleation rate @xmath25 the absence of correlations of the nucleations of nearby bubbles , and that bubbles can not nucleate inside regions already within bubbles .    first a lightning review of the geometry of de sitter space .",
