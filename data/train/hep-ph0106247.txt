    "the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) experiment @xcite has recently presented the first measurements of the @xmath15 reaction rate induced by @xmath3b solar neutrinos through charged currents ( cc ) @xcite .",
    "the observed cc event rate , normalized to the latest standard solar model ( ssm ) prediction @xcite , @xmath16 not only confirms the deficit of solar neutrino events previously observed by the chlorine @xcite , gallium @xcite , and water - cherenkov @xcite experiments , but provides a @xmath9 evidence @xcite for a @xmath17 contribution in the super - kamiokande ( sk ) measurement of the @xmath18 reaction rate ( @xmath19 ) in a similar energy range @xcite , @xmath20    the sk - sno comparison can be made rigorously model - independent by making an appropriate choice for the sk energy threshold , as suggested in @xcite and discussed also in the sno paper @xcite . in this work we first provide ( sec .",
    "ii ) an improved discussion of such model - independent comparison , which , based on the ( previously undisclosed ) detailed sno detector specifications , confirms the @xmath9 evidence for a @xmath17 flavor component in the sk event sample .",
    "we then assume ( sec .  iii ) no oscillations into sterile neutrinos , and derive combined constraints on two free parameters : ( i ) the ratio @xmath2 of the _ true _ @xmath3b @xmath0 flux from the sun to the corresponding value predicted by the ssm , and ( ii ) the @xmath4 survival probability @xmath5 averaged over the sk - sno response function .",
    "such constraints confirm the ssm prediction for @xmath2 , and strongly indicate an average @xmath4 flux suppression of about one third @xmath21 ) .",
    "finally ( sec .",
    "iv ) we assume the validity of the ssm , and perform and updated analysis of all the available solar neutrino data ( including the sno event rate ) in a @xmath11 active oscillation framework .",
    "large mixing angle solutions are clearly preferred in the global fit , while the small - mixing one is not allowed at the @xmath1 level ( 99.73% c.l . ) by the parameter estimation test .",
    "we conclude our work in sec .",
    "an important characteristic of any solar neutrino experiment is the energy spectrum of parent neutrinos contributing to the collected event sample in the absence of oscillations  the so - called response function @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the response function basically folds the solar neutrino energy spectrum with both the differential interaction cross section and with the detector threshold and energy resolution , and thus it takes different forms for each experiment .",
    "however , it can be made ( partly accidentally ) equal in sk and sno by an appropriate choice of the detected electron energy thresholds ( or , more generally , energy ranges ) , as shown in @xcite on the basis of the _ expected _ sno technical specifications .    by repeating the analysis in @xcite with the present sno kinetic energy threshold @xmath23 mev ) and energy resolution @xcite",
    ", we find a best - fit sk - sno agreement for a sk threshold @xmath24 mev ( instead of @xmath25 , for which the value in eq .",
    "( [ sk ] ) is officially quoted @xcite ) .",
    "such `` adjusted '' threshold is in good agreement with the one estimated in the sno paper ( @xmath26 mev @xcite ) .",
    "figure  1 displays our calculations for the corresponding sk and sno response functions to @xmath3b neutrinos , which appear to be in very good agreement with each other .",
    "concerning the small shape difference in the first half of the response functions , we estimate that , in our analysis , the corresponding effect is ( in the worst case ) a factor of five smaller than the effect of the total sno uncertainty in eq .",
    "( [ sno ] ) , so that we can safely take @xmath27 . with the adjusted sk threshold , the sk and sno detectors are thus equally sensitive to the incoming @xmath3b neutrinos .",
    "the possible small contribution of _ hep _ neutrinos ( not shown in fig .",
    "1 ) does not spoil the sk - sno equalization of response functions @xcite , as far as the _ hep _ flux is taken below the experimental upper limit provide by the latest sk spectral measurements @xcite .",
    "although there is no official number quoted yet by the sk collaboration for the sk / ssm value at @xmath28 mev , one can try to recover it from the published sk spectral data @xcite .",
    "we adopt the provisional sno own estimate @xcite , corresponding to take @xmath29 which amounts to a small shift in the central value of the total sk rate .",
    "the attached sk error is assumed to be basically the same as in eq .",
    "( [ sk ] ) , since it should be dominated by systematic errors rather than by statistical uncertainties .",
    "furthermore , the sk - sno comparison is dominated by the ( presently ) larger sno uncertainties , so that any ( presumably small ) official sk re - evaluation of the numbers in eq .",
    "( [ sk ] ) is not expected to produce significant changes in the results discussed below @xcite .    for @xmath27",
    ", the following relations hold _ exactly _ @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath2 is the ratio between the true ( unknown ) @xmath3b @xmath4 flux at the sun and its ssm prediction @xcite , @xmath5 is the @xmath4 survival probability ( energy - averaged over the common sk - sno response function ) , @xmath31 is the averaged transition probability to active neutrinos @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the ratio of the ( properly averaged @xcite ) cross sections of @xmath34 and @xmath4 on electrons .",
    "we calculate @xmath35 for @xmath36  mev .",
    "notice that the above relations do not imply any assumption either on @xmath2 , or on possible sterile neutrino oscillations , or on the functional form of @xmath37 or @xmath38 , and thus they are _ completely model - independent_.    from the above relations one can derive that : @xmath39 figure  2 displays the above constraints at a glance .",
    "the sk+sno experimental data are well within the region where there _ must _ be @xmath40 transitions , independently of a possibly open @xcite @xmath41 channel . only at @xmath9 ( more precisely , at @xmath42 sigma )",
    "the experimental data would hit the diagonal line which parametrizes the case of no @xmath40 transitions ( corresponding to either no oscillations or pure @xmath41 oscillations ) .",
    "such results represent an alternative way to look at the sno evidence @xcite for a @xmath17 component in the sk events at @xmath9 .",
    "the sno results @xcite and the model - independent analysis in the previous section show that there is evidence for active neutrino transitions .",
    "therefore , it is legitimate to explore the consequences of the _ additional _ hypothesis of _ purely active _ flavor transitions , corresponding to take @xmath43 . in such a case , the sk - sno relations in eqs .",
    "( [ snorel ] ) and ( [ skrel ] ) read @xmath44 providing a system of two equations in the two unknowns @xmath2 and @xmath45 . by fitting the experimental values of sno / ssm and sk / ssm given in eqs  ( [ sno ] ) and ( [ sk ] ) , respectively , one",
    "can then determined allowed ranges for @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",
    "figure  3 shows the contours of the allowed region in the ( @xmath46 ) plane for @xmath47 and 9 , whose _ projections _ onto the coordinate axes give the @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath1 separate ranges @xcite for @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",
    "the strong anticorrelation reflects the fact that a high @xmath3b flux can be partly compensated by a smaller survival probability , and vice versa .",
    "the projected @xmath1 range for @xmath2 ( @xmath6 ) is in agreement with the ssm prediction ( shown with its @xmath50 error band from @xcite , @xmath51 ) . on the other hand , the projected @xmath1 range for the average survival probability ( @xmath8 ) , clashes with the standard electroweak model prediction of electron flavor conservation ( @xmath10 ) at @xmath9 . in the context of this figure , the standard model of",
    "the sun appears to be in better shape that the standard model of electroweak interactions .",
    "the results indicate that , in the case of generic active oscillations ( i.e. , no other assumption apart from @xmath52 in the range probed jointly by sk and sno ) , the @xmath4 survival probability takes basically the lowest value allowed by pre - sno experiments .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the lowest values of @xmath5 ( in the @xmath3b energy range ) are typically reached within the so - called large mixing angle ( lma ) solution to the solar neutrino problem , which may therefore be expected as favored .",
    "this will be confirmed by the analysis in the next section .",
    "from the sno results @xcite and from the analysis in the previous sections we have learned that : ( i ) there is evidence for active neutrino oscillations , and ( ii ) assuming purely active @xmath0 oscillations , the ssm is confirmed and the @xmath4 survival probability should be @xmath53 in the sk - sno energy range .",
    "let us now make two further assumptions about neutrino physics , namely , that the @xmath0 fluxes from the sun can be taken as predicted ( with their uncertainties ) by the ssm @xcite , and that active neutrino oscillations occur in an effective two - family framework .",
    "the latter hypothesis is totally correct if the mixing angle @xmath54 vanishes , and is accurate up to @xmath55 corrections if @xmath56 .",
    "we remind that the joint analyses of sk atmospheric neutrino data @xcite and of the chooz reactor results @xcite place stringent upper limits on @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the chooz data forbid large @xmath4 disappearance for neutrino square mass differences higher than @xmath57 ev@xmath58 , and thus they are also relevant to cut away the region of energy - averaged solar neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "therefore , we perform a @xmath11 analysis by adding the final chooz spectral results @xcite ( 14 bin , as discussed in @xcite ) to the usual solar neutrino data , and show then the results in the mass - mixing plane @xmath59 , covering both octants in @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "since we are now assuming a specific functional form for @xmath37 ( i.e. , the one predicted by standard oscillation theory at any given mass - mixing point ) , the sk - sno model - independent comparison becomes unimportant , and we can use the full sk rate given in eq .",
    "( [ sk ] ) @xcite .",
    "concerning sno , in this work we include the total cc rate [ eq .",
    "( [ sno ] ) ] but not the published cc energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "notice that the present sno spectrum information should be subdominant as compared to sk since , although one expects a sno sensitivity to spectral deviations a factor of two larger than in sk @xcite , the current sno spectral errors ( both statistical and systematic ) are more than a factor of two larger than in sk ( and the published sno event sample is an order of magnitude smaller than the sk one ) .",
    "moreover , it is not easy to recover ( from both the published sno and sk data ) the information needed to propagate _",
    "jointly _ , on both the sk and sno spectra , the correlated @xmath3b shape spectrum uncertainties @xcite around the best - fit @xmath0 spectrum ( that we take from @xcite as in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we prefer to postpone the sno spectrum analysis ( and its properly correlated combination with the sk spectrum ) to a future work @xcite .",
    "the total sno cc rate is , however , already important by itself , and to appreciate its impact we show first the @xmath11 analysis _ without _ sno for reference .",
    "figure  4 shows the results of the @xmath11 analysis using the three pre - sno total solar neutrino rates ( chlorine @xcite , combined gallium @xcite , sk @xcite ) and to the 14-bin chooz data @xcite ( relevant to suppress the likelihood of the high-@xmath14 region ) , as derived by drawing iso-@xmath61 contours ( for @xmath62 ) around the global @xmath63 minimum .",
    "the fit in fig .",
    "4 favors the small - mixing angle ( sma ) solution , as compared to the regions at @xmath64 , usually referred to as large - mixing angle at high @xmath14 ( lma ) and at low @xmath65 ( low ) , extending down to the quasivacuum and vacuum oscillation ( qvo and vo ) regions .",
    "figure  5 shows the impact of the sk day - night spectral data @xcite ( 19 + 19 bins minus one adjustable normalization factor ) , that cut away the vacuum solutions and also change the relative likelihood of the local sma , lma , and low best fits , favoring the lma solution ( see also table  i ) .",
    "notice also the small region allowed at 99.73% c.l .  in the lowest @xmath14 decade ( the so - called just - so@xmath58 solution ,",
    "see the first of ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "similar results have been largely discussed in the recent solar neutrino literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and we do not add further comments here .",
    "figure  6 is analogous to fig .  4 , but including the sno cc rate @xcite .",
    "the lma ( sma ) solution in fig .",
    "6 is enlarged ( reduced ) as compared to fig .  4 , due to the anticipated sno preference for relatively small values of the @xmath4 average survival probability , which tend to favor the lma case .",
    "the sma solution tends to adapt to the low value @xmath66 by privileging its rightmost part ( where the nonadiabatic @xmath4 suppression is stronger ) , and indeed the final compromise makes the sma local fit comparable to the lma one ( see table  i ) .",
    "however , in doing so , the sma fit also privileges the part where spectral deviations are sizable , contrary to the sk day - night spectrum observations .",
    "indeed , the sma solution disappears at @xmath9 when the sk day - night spectral data are included , as shown in fig .  7 ( analogous to fig .  5 , but including the sno total cc rate ) .",
    "the `` tension '' between the total rate information ( pushing the sma to the right ) and the sk spectrum ( pushing the sma to the left ) , which was already emerging from the latest sk data analysis @xcite , is now sufficiently strong to produce a significant decrease of the likelihood of the sma solution . since the sno spectral data @xcite ( not included here ) do not show any deviation from the standard shape within the ( now large ) errors , we may expect that the addition of such data in future analyses can only corroborate such trend .",
    "the lma solution appears to be favored in the global fit , enhancing the hopes of interesting new physics at kamland @xcite and at future neutrino factories @xcite .",
    "the low solution turns out to be slightly less favored then the lma one , essentially because the gallium data prefer an increase of the @xmath4 survival probability at low energies , which is more easily provided in the lma region rather than in the low solution ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the low solution is still in good shape , and should be tested through day - night earth matter effects in the borexino experiment @xcite or , with less sensitivity , through winter - summer matter effects after several years of data taking in the gallium neutrino observatory ( gno ) @xcite .",
    "notice that the low solution extends down to the quasivacuum oscillation @xcite region , which might be probed in borexino by pushing its time - variation sensitivity close to its upper limits @xcite .",
    "notice that no vo or just - so@xmath58 solutions survive in fig .",
    ". finally , we remark that the indications for a relatively small value of @xmath5 suggest that a large , unmistakable neutral - to - current ratio enhancement ( roughly @xmath67 ) should be found by the sno experiment in its second phase of operation ( neutral current mode ) .",
    "we have discussed the following implications of the first sno results ( with increasing degree of model dependence ) : ( i ) evidence for @xmath40 transitions from a model - independent comparison of sk and sno ; ( ii ) bounds on the @xmath3b neutrino flux factor @xmath2 and on the average @xmath4 survival probability under the hypothesis of ( generic ) active @xmath0 oscillations ; and finally ( iii ) marked preference for large - mixing solutions _ vs _ the small mixing one , by assuming both active oscillations and standard solar model predictions .",
    "it seems that the sno experiment has just started to delight us with the first of a series of interesting results .",
