    "in 1983 laughlin introduced a laughlin ground - state wave function for a system of @xmath12 electrons at @xmath13 , and studied the elementary excitations ( quasiparticles ) over the ground - state@xcite .",
    "he predicted that the quasiparticle has a _ fractional charge _ : @xmath14 this prediction was later confirmed in the magnetotransport experiments by clark _",
    "et al_. and others@xcite .",
    "the 1998 nobel prize was shared by tsui , strmer ( experimental discovery ) and laughlin ( theory ) for their contribution to the fractional qhe .",
    "the prevalent theories@xcite based on the laughlin wave function in the schrdinger picture deal with the qhe at 0 k and immediately above .",
    "the system ground - state , however , does not carry a current . to interpret the experimental data it is convenient to introduce composite ( c- ) particles ( bosons , fermions ) .",
    "the c - boson ( fermion ) , each containing an electron and an odd ( even ) number of _ flux quanta ( fluxons ) _ , were introduced by zhang _",
    "et al_.@xcite and others ( jain@xcite ) for the description of the fractional qhe ( fermi liquid ) .",
    "all qhe states with distinctive plateaus in @xmath15 are observed below the critical temperature @xmath16k .",
    "the qhe in graphene , a single sheet of graphite , is an exception .",
    "it is desirable to treat the qhe below and above @xmath17 in a unified manner .",
    "the extreme accuracy ( precision @xmath18 ) in which each plateau is observed means that the current density @xmath19 must be computed exactly without averaging . in the prevalent theories@xcite the electron - electron interaction and pauli s exclusion principle are regarded as the cause for the qhe .",
    "both are essentially repulsive and can not account for the fact that the c - particles are bound , that is , they are in negative - energy states . besides , the prevalent theories have limitations :    * the zero temperature limit is taken at the outset . then the question why qhe is observed below 0.5k in gaas / algaas can not be answered .",
    "we better have a theory for all temperatures . *",
    "the high - field limit is taken at the outset .",
    "the integer qhe are observed for small integer @xmath20 only .",
    "the question why the qhe is not observed for high @xmath20 ( weak field ) can not be answered .",
    "we better describe the phenomena for all fields . *",
    "the hall resistivity @xmath15 value @xmath21 is obtained in a single stroke . to obtain @xmath15",
    "we need two separate measurements of the hall field @xmath22 and the current density @xmath19",
    ". we must calculate @xmath23 and take the ratio @xmath24 .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to show that the known fractional qhe can be described within the frame - work of c - particles model without using laughlin s theory and results about the fractional charge .",
    "fujita and okamura developed a quantum statistical theory of the qhe@xcite .",
    "we follow this theory .",
    "see this reference for more details .    there is a remarkable similarity between the qhe _ and _ the high - temperature superconductivity ( htsc ) , both occurring in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems as pointed out by laughlin@xcite . the major superconducting properties observed in the htsc are ( a ) zero resistance , ( b ) a sharp phase change , ( c ) an energy gap below @xmath25 , ( d ) flux quantization , ( e ) meissner effect , and ( f ) josephson effects . all these have been observed in gaas / algaas .",
    "we regard the _ phonon exchange attraction _ as the causes of both qhe and superconductivity . starting with a reasonable hamiltonian",
    ", we calculate everything using quantum statistical mechanics .    the countability concept of the fluxons , known as the _ flux quantization _ : @xmath26 where @xmath27 sample area , @xmath28 fluxon number ( integer ) and @xmath29 planck constant , is originally due to onsager@xcite .",
    "the magnetic ( electric ) field is an axial ( polar ) vector and the associated fluxon ( photon ) is a half - spin fermion ( full - spin boson ) . the magnetic ( electric ) flux line can not ( can ) terminate at a sink , which supports the fermionic ( bosonic ) nature of the associated fluxon ( photon )",
    ". no half - spin fermion can annihilate by itself because of angular momentum conservation .",
    "the electron spin originates in the relativistic quantum equation ( dirac s theory of electron)@xcite .",
    "the discrete ( two ) quantum numbers @xmath30 can not change in the continuous limit , and hence the spin must be conserved .",
    "the countability and statistics of the fluxon are fundamental particle properties .",
    "we postulate that _ the fluxon is a half - spin fermion with zero mass and zero charge_.    we assume that the magnetic field @xmath31 is applied perpendicular to the interface .",
    "the 2d landau level energy , @xmath32 with the states @xmath33 , @xmath34 , have a great degeneracy .",
    "the cyclotron frequency @xmath35 contains the electron effective mass @xmath36 .",
    "the center - of - mass ( cm ) of _ any _ c - particle moves as a fermion ( boson ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of the cm momentum are limited to 0 or 1 ( unlimited ) if it contains an odd ( even ) number of elementary fermions .",
    "this rule is known as the _ ehrenfest - oppenheimer - bethe s _ ( eob s ) _ _ rule__@xcite .",
    "hence the cm motion of the composite containing an electron and @xmath37 fluxons is bosonic ( fermonic ) if @xmath37 is odd ( even ) .",
    "the system of c - bosons condenses below the critical temperature @xmath17 and exhibits a superconducting state while the system of c - fermions shows a fermi liquid behavior .",
    "a longitudinal phonon , acoustic or optical , generates a density wave , which affects the electron ( fluxon ) motion through the charge displacement ( current ) .",
    "the exchange of a phonon between electrons and fluxons generates an _ attractive _ transition .",
    "bardeen , cooper and schrieffer ( bcs)@xcite assumed the existence of cooper pairs@xcite in a superconductor , and wrote down a hamiltonian containing the  electron \" and  hole \" kinetic energies and the pairing interaction hamiltonian with the phonon variables eliminated .",
    "we start with a bcs - like hamiltonian @xmath38 for the qhe@xcite : @xmath39,\\quad\\label{4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the number operator for the `` electron '' ( 1 ) [ `` hole '' ( 2 ) , fluxon ( 3 ) ] at momentum @xmath41 and spin @xmath42 with the energy @xmath43 , with annihilation ( creation ) operators @xmath44 @xmath45 satisfying the fermi anti - commutation rules : @xmath46 the fluxon number operator @xmath47 is represented by @xmath48 with @xmath49 @xmath50 satisfying the anti - commutation rules : @xmath51 the phonon exchange can create electron - fluxon composites , bosonic or fermionic , depending on the number of fluxons .",
    "the center - of - mass of any composite moves as a fermion(boson ) if it contains an odd(even ) numbers of elementary fermions .",
    "we call the conduction - electron composite with an odd ( even ) number of fluxons c - boson(c - fermion ) .",
    "the electron(hole)-type c - particles carry negative ( positive ) charge .",
    "we expect that electron(hole)-type c - bosons are generated by the phonon - exchange attraction .",
    "the pair operators @xmath52 are defined by @xmath53 the prime on the summation in eq.([4 ] ) means the restriction : @xmath54 , @xmath55 debye frequency .",
    "the pairing interaction terms in eq.([4 ] ) conserve the charge . the term @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , @xmath27 sample area , is the pairing strength , generates a transition in electron - type c - fermion states . similarly , the exchange of a phonon generates a transition between hole - type c - fermion states , represented by @xmath58 .",
    "the phonon exchange can also pair - create(pair - annihilate ) electron(hole)-type c - boson pairs , and the effects of these processes are represented by @xmath59 @xmath60 .",
    "the cooper pair is formed from two  electrons \" ( or  holes \" ) .",
    "likewise the c - bosons may be formed by the phonon - exchange attraction from c - fermions and fluxons .",
    "if the density of the c - bosons is high enough , then the c - bosons will be condensed and exhibit a superconductivity .    to treat superconductivity",
    "we modify the pair operators in eq.([7 ] ) as @xmath61 then , the pairing interaction terms in eq.(4 ) are formally identical with those in the generalized bcs hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "we first consider integer qhe .",
    "we choose a conduction electron and a fluxon for the pair .",
    "the c - bosons , having the linear dispersion relation , can move in all directions in the plane with the constant speed @xmath62 .",
    "the supercurrent is generated by @xmath63c - bosons monochromatically condensed , running along the sample length .",
    "the supercurrent density ( magnitude ) @xmath19 , calculated by the rule : @xmath64 , is given by @xmath65 the induced hall field ( magnitude ) @xmath22 equals @xmath66 .",
    "the magnetic flux is quantized : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the fluxon density and @xmath69 is the magnetic flux quantum . hence we obtain @xmath70 we assume that _ the c - fermion containing an electron and an even number of fluxons has a charge magnitude _ @xmath0 . for the integer qhe , @xmath71 , @xmath72 for the carriers ,",
    "thus we obtain @xmath73 , the correct plateau value observed for the principal qhe at @xmath74 .",
    "the supercurrent generated by equal numbers of @xmath63c - bosons condensed monochromatically is neutral .",
    "this is reflected in our calculations in eq.([9 ] ) .",
    "the supercondensate whose motion generates the supercurrent must be neutral .",
    "if it has a charge , it would be accelerated indefinitely by the external field because the impurities and phonons can not stop the supercurrent to grow .",
    "that is , the circuit containing a superconducting sample and a battery must be burnt out if the supercondensate is not neutral . in the calculation of @xmath15 in eq.([11 ] ) , we used the _ unaveraged _ drift velocity difference @xmath75 , which is significant .",
    "_ only _ the unaveraged drift velocity cancels out @xmath76 exactly from numerator / denominator , leading to an exceedingly accurate plateau value .",
    "thus we derived the precise plateau value @xmath77 in experiment for the principal qhe    we now extend our theory to include elementary fermions ( electron , fluxon ) as members of the c - fermion set .",
    "we can then treat the superconductivity and the qhe in a unified manner .",
    "the c - boson containing a pair of one electron and one fluxon can be used to describe the room temperature qhe in graphene@xcite .",
    "important pairings and effects are listed below .    * a pair of conduction electrons , superconductivity * fluxon and c - fermions , qhe * a pair of like - charge conduction electrons with two fluxons , qhe in graphene .",
    "we postulate that _ any _ c - fermion has the effective charge @xmath78 equal to the electron charge ( magnitude ) @xmath0 : @xmath79 let us consider a c - fermion containing an electron and two fluxons .",
    "we shall show that the c - fermion density @xmath80 is connected with the electron density @xmath3 by @xmath81 if the c - fermions run in the @xmath82-field direction with the drift velocity @xmath76 , the current density @xmath19 is given by @xmath83 the hall field @xmath22 is @xmath84 the hall conductivity @xmath85 is defined and calculated as follows .",
    "@xmath86 which is the correct value of @xmath85 at @xmath87 .",
    "the last two members of eqs .([16 ] ) signifies eq.([13 ] ) .",
    "in fact if we assume eqs .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) , then we obtain equations ( [ 16 ] ) .    similarly for the case of c",
    "- fermions with four fluxons we obtain @xmath88 .    extending eq.(13 ) to a general case , we obtain @xmath89 where @xmath1 is an odd number .",
    "the density @xmath2 is proportional to the magnetic field @xmath52 .",
    "equation ( [ 17 ] ) is valid for a large @xmath1 . as the magnetic field",
    "is raised , the separation between the ll becomes greater , and the higher-@xmath1 c - fermion is more difficult to form energetically .",
    "this condition is unlikely to depend on the statistics of the c - particles .",
    "thus eq.([17 ] ) should be valid for all integers , odd or even .",
    "we take the case of @xmath90 .",
    "the c - boson containing an electron and three fluxons can be formed from a c - fermion with two fluxons and a fluxon by the phonon exchange attraction . if the c - bosons are bose - condensed , the supercurrent density @xmath19 is given by eq.([9 ] ) .",
    "hence we obtain @xmath91 where we used @xmath92 from eq.([12 ] ) , and @xmath93 , a bosonic extension of eq.([17 ] ) .",
    "the principal fractional qhe occurs at @xmath13 , where the hall resistivity value is @xmath94 .",
    "a set of weaker qhe occur on the weaker field side at @xmath95 the qhe behavior at @xmath96 for any @xmath37 is similar . we illustrate it by taking integer qhe with @xmath97 .",
    "the field magnitude becomes smaller with increasing @xmath20 .",
    "the ll degeneracy is proportional to @xmath52 , and hence @xmath20 ll s must be considered .",
    "first consider the case @xmath98 . without the phonon - exchange attraction",
    "the electrons occupy the lowest two ll s with spin .",
    "the electrons at each level form fundamental ( f)c - bosons .     after the phonon - exchange attraction and the bec of the c - bosons . ]    in the superconducting state the supercondensate occupy the monochromatically condensed state , which is separated by the superconducting gap @xmath99 from the continuum states ( band ) as shown in the right - hand figure in fig.1 .",
    "the c - boson density @xmath7 at each ll is one - half the density at @xmath74 , which is equal to the electron density @xmath3 fixed for the sample .",
    "extending the theory to a general integer , we have @xmath100 this means that both @xmath101 and @xmath99 are smaller , making the plateau width ( a measure of @xmath99 ) smaller in agreement with experiments .",
    "the c - bosons have lower energies than the conduction electrons . hence at the extreme low temperatures the supercurrent due to the condensed c - bosons dominates the normal current due to the conduction electrons and non - condensed c - bosons , giving rise to the dip in @xmath102 .",
    "in summary we have achieved our goal of treating fractional qhe in terms of c - particles without using laughlin s results in terms of fractional charges carried by the quasiparticles .",
    "we found that the principal fractional qhe occurs at @xmath103 , @xmath37 ( odd integers ) with the hall conductivity @xmath104 , where the density of c - bosons with @xmath37 fluxons , @xmath105 , is connected with the density of condensed c - bosons with @xmath37 fluxons , @xmath7 , by @xmath106 .      *",
    "a set of weaker fractional qhe occur on the smaller field side at @xmath96 , with the hall conductivity @xmath107 .",
    "the plateau widths ( a measure of @xmath99 ) are smaller are since the condensed c - boson density @xmath7 is smaller . both the critical temperature @xmath108 and the superconducting energy gap @xmath99 are smaller .",
    "* the fractional fermonic principal qhe with a finite conductivity and the hall conductivity @xmath85 equal to @xmath109 , occur at @xmath103 , @xmath37 ( even integers ) , where the density of c - fermions with @xmath37 fluxons , @xmath105 , is connected with the density of conduction electrons , @xmath3 , by @xmath110 .",
    "all of the qhe points fall on the straight line representing the classical hall effect if the @xmath85 is plotted as a function of @xmath103 .",
    "* the higher in @xmath1 c - particle is more difficult to form energetically since the ll separation is greater .      * the horizontal stretch of @xmath85 accompanied by the zero resistivity at the mid - point of the stretch , the signature of the qhe , arises from the superconducting energy gap @xmath99 . *",
    "the cause of the qhe is the phonon exchange attraction between c - fermion and fluxons .",
    "this allows us to develop a unified theory of superconductivity and qhe . * the hall conductivity @xmath85 ( @xmath111 the current density @xmath19/the hall field @xmath22 )",
