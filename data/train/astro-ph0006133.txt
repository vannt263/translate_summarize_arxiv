    "atmospheric erenkov technique ( act ) , is a well established and a unique method for the astronomical investigation of very high energy ( vhe , also referred to as @xmath0 ) @xmath1 rays .",
    "it is based on the effective detection and study of the erenkov light emitted by the secondary particles produced in the extensive air showers initiated by the primary @xmath1 ray @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the abundant charged cosmic ray particles generate erenkov light akin to that produced by the @xmath1 rays as a result of which the @xmath1 ray signal is buried in a vast sea of cosmic ray background .",
    "this has been a major difficulty in applying the atmospheric erenkov technique successfully for @xmath1 ray astronomy .",
    "the first generation erenkov telescopes addressed the problem of cosmic ray background by matching the telescope aperture to the angular size of the erenkov flash @xcite .",
    "in addition , many of the potential astrophysical sources of vhe @xmath1 rays are expected to produce modulated signals ( _ e.g. _ @xmath1 ray pulsars , x - ray binaries , cataclysmic variables etc ) .",
    "thus techniques based on well established methods of phase sensitive detection were used to enhance the detection of @xmath1 rays against the randomly arriving background @xcite .",
    "this technique can not be applied however for steady sources of @xmath3rays like the blazars , normal galaxies or unidentified @xmath1ray sources discovered at @xmath4 energies .",
    "there are , however , differences in the detailed structure of the detected erenkov flash due to the fact that the cosmic ray background protons are spatially and temporally isotropic while the @xmath1 rays emanate from the point sources . in addition",
    ", the physics of the hadronic cascades initiated by the protons in the earth s atmosphere is different from the electromagnetic cascade generated by the @xmath5 rays .",
    "detailed monte carlo simulations have been employed to study these differences .",
    "techniques based on the shape of the lateral distribution of the erenkov light pool to delineate the source direction , have been studied @xcite despite large fluctuations in the measured erenkov photon densities @xcite .",
    "there are several atmospheric erenkov arrays designed precisely to apply these techniques to ground based vhe @xmath1 ray astronomy @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the imaging technique has been shown to be successful and also has been demonstrated to work reliably in detecting emission from several @xmath0 @xmath1 ray sources @xcite .",
    "the spatial and temporal properties of the erenkov photons also contain valuable information on the development and propagation of the eas in the atmosphere . as a result ,",
    "systematic studies of these photons as received at the observation level could lead to the development of techniques to distinguish between hadronic or photon primaries .",
    "@xmath1ray primaries for example , develop higher in the atmosphere resulting in compact images as well as narrower pulses .",
    "one would therefore expect correlations between different pulse shape parameters and imaging parameters .",
    "extensive studies have already been carried out in this regard using detailed simulation techniques .",
    "most of these studies were carried out at higher energies with the aim of studying the elemental composition of cosmic rays at these energies @xcite .",
    "the possibility of applying pulse shape discrimination technique to improve the signal to noise ratio in the data from crab nebula was first demonstrated by tmer _",
    "their study was solely based on the presence or absence of kinks and other anomalies like long trailing edges of the erenkov pulses indicating hadronic origin .",
    "these criteria were not based on any systematic simulation studies nor were they conveniently parameterized so that it could be used by others .",
    "several characteristics of the hadron- & @xmath1 ray showers which were suggested as possible discriminators in the past have been met with limited success .",
    "some of these are the presence of penetrating particles among the eas secondaries @xcite , the ultraviolet excess in hadron initiated showers due to their proximity to the observation level @xcite and time duration @xcite . on the other hand methods developed for improving the angular resolution technique @xcite are still in use and are one of the important methods of discrimination for non - imaging arrays which are generally spread out .",
    "a brief description of the efficacy of the pulse shape discrimination in vhe @xmath1 ray astronomy was made by patterson & hillas @xcite .",
    "their study was based solely on the presence of structure on the leading or trailing edge of the erenkov pulses as suggested before @xcite .",
    "however no systematic studies of the rise or decay times , fwhm etc were carried out .",
    "recently roberts _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , developed a technique based on the temporal erenkov pulse shape and showed that the use of rise time at large zenith angles and fwhm at smaller zenith angles are effective discriminators .",
    "however these studies are carried out at larger zenith angle ( @xmath6 ) and hence the conclusions are relevant only at larger primary energies ( @xmath7 ) . on the other hand cabot _",
    "@xcite suggest possibility of identifying the muonic component , which precedes the electromagnetic component , of the erenkov pulse in order to separate the @xmath5 ray signal from the background .",
    "this could be a very efficient technique in experiments based on wavefront sampling technique .",
    "but once again this method works only at higher primary energies ( @xmath8 ) where a significant number of muons are produced .    in an earlier work@xcite functional fits",
    "have been carried out to the spherical shower front to demonstrate that the radii of curvature are equal to the height of the shower maximum at all observation levels .",
    "it has also been demonstrated in that paper that the erenkov photon arrival time distributions can be well fitted by a lognormal function . using these fits , radial and spectral variation of pulse shape parameters",
    "have been studied systematically .    in the present work we plan to make a systematic study of the temporal and spatial profile of erenkov light from lower energy primaries both from pure electromagnetic cascades as well as hadronic cascades generated by @xmath0 energy primaries .",
    "the question we are trying to answer is whether the observed differences in experimentally measurable temporal information could be used to separate electromagnetic component from the hadronic background .    in  2 of this paper details of simulations",
    "are given , followed by definition of figure of merit for discrimination between @xmath5 rays and cosmic rays in  3 . in ",
    "4 we discuss the results from the analysis of the curvature of the erenkov front whereas in  5 we present results based on the pulse shape parameters and identify the more sensitive of them . in ",
    "6 we present the detailed study of the photon arrival time jitter .",
    "the dependence of the parameters on the telescope opening angle , altitude of observation , incident angle of the primary as well as cosmic ray species and the shower core distance are discussed in  7 .",
    "a brief discussion of the results is presented in  8 and conclusions are summarized in  9 .",
    "a package called corsika ( version 560 ) , @xcite has been used to simulate erenkov light emission in the earth s atmosphere by the secondaries of the extensive air showers generated by cosmic ray primaries or @xmath5 rays .",
    "this program simulates interactions of nuclei , hadrons , muons , electrons and photons as well as decays of unstable secondaries in the atmosphere .",
    "it uses egs4 code @xcite for the electromagnetic component of the air shower simulation and dual parton model for the simulation of hadronic interactions at @xmath0 energies .",
    "the erenkov radiation produced within the specified band width ( 300 - 650 @xmath9 ) by the charged secondaries is propagated to the ground .",
    "the us standard atmosphere parameterized by linsley @xcite has been used .",
    "the position , angle , time ( with respect to the first interaction ) and production height of each photon hitting the detector on the observation level are recorded .    in the present studies we have mainly used pachmarhi ( longitude : 78@xmath10 26@xmath11 e , latitude : 22@xmath10 28@xmath12 and altitude : 1075 @xmath13 ) as the observation level where an array of erenkov detectors each of area deployed paraxially on a single equatorial mount .",
    "] 4.35 @xmath14 is deployed in the form of a rectangular array .",
    "we have assumed 17 detectors in the e - w direction with a separation of 25 @xmath13 and 21 detectors in the n - s direction with a separation of 20 m. this configuration , similar to the pachmarhi array of erenkov telescopes ( pact ) @xcite but much larger , is chosen so that one can study the core distance dependence of various observable parameters .",
    "monoenergetic primaries consisting of @xmath5 rays , protons and iron nuclei incident vertically on the top of the atmosphere with their cores at the centre of the array have been simulated in the present studies .",
    "the showers simulated in this study have a fixed core position which is chosen to be the detector at the centre of the array . the resulting erenkov pool is sampled by all the 357 detectors which are used to study the core distance dependence of the parameters studied here .",
    "all the telescopes are assumed to have their optic axes aligned vertically .",
    "an option of variable bunch size of the erenkov photons is available in the package which serves to reduce the requirement of hardware resources .",
    "however since we are interested in the fluctuations of each of the estimated observables , we have tracked single photons for each primary at all energies .",
    "multiple scattering length for electrons and positrons is decided by the parameter stepfc in the egs code which has been set to 0.1 in the present studies @xcite .",
    "wavelength dependent absorption of erenkov photons in the atmosphere is not however taken into account .",
    "the present conclusions are expected to be independent of photon wavelengths .",
    "figure of merit of a parameter that can distinguish between vhe @xmath3rays and cosmic ray hadrons depends primarily on two factors .",
    "firstly , it should accept most of the @xmath1rays and secondly it should be able to reject most of the hadrons . in general , this figure of merit could be a function of primary energy . in the present work",
    "we define such a figure of merit which is often called as _ quality factor _ , as @xcite :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the number of @xmath2 rays accepted ,    @xmath17 is the total number of @xmath2 rays ,    @xmath18 is the number of background cosmic rays accepted and    @xmath19 is the total number of background cosmic rays .",
    "the quality factor thus defined is independent of the actual number of @xmath1rays and protons recorded .    in this paper , whenever a pair of distributions of a parameter under study for a hadron and a @xmath1ray primary are shown the threshold value of the parameter is indicated by a vertical line .",
    "the threshold is chosen such that it yields maximum quality factor subject to the condition that the accepted fraction of @xmath1rays is @xmath20 and that of protons is @xmath21 .",
    "the errors on the qulaity factors shown in each case are statistical only .",
    "it has been shown long ago that the radius of curvature of the erenkov light front is strongly correlated with the height of shower maximum from the observation level @xcite .",
    "this has been found to be true for different species of cosmic rays @xcite . for photonic primaries the height of shower maximum",
    "is decided by the radiation length in the atmosphere while that for hadronic primaries it is decided by the interaction length which in turn depends on the interaction cross - section in air .",
    "hence the radius of curvature could be species specific .",
    "therefore we have investigated the possibility of using the fitted radius of curvature of the spherical erenkov front as a parameter to distinguish between @xmath1 ray and proton initiated showers .",
    "the details of a spherical fit to the mean arrival times of erenkov photons at detectors sampling the front at various core distances are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "1 shows the distribution of the fitted radii for different primary species of various energies .",
    "the primaries are incident vertically at the top of the atmosphere except wherever mentioned .",
    "mono - energetic @xmath1ray and hadron primaries of comparable erenkov yield are simulated and compared .",
    "we also simulated showers , both for @xmath1 rays and protons whose energies are selected randomly from a power law distribution of a differential slope of -2.65 . this would also simulate the real data as one would record in an experiment .",
    "while the slope of the @xmath5 ray spectrum could be different from what is chosen here , the quality factor does not depend on the number of showers and hence independent of the spectral slope except when it shows strong energy dependence .",
    "the energy bandwidth chosen here are 500 @xmath4 - 10 @xmath0 for @xmath5 rays while it is 1 @xmath0 - 20 @xmath0 for protons .    quality factors , as defined above , have been estimated for the present sample from the distributions of the estimated radii of curvature for @xmath1 ray and hadronic primaries as shown in figure 1 .",
    "these are given in table 1 .",
    "the threshold values in each case are indicated as vertical lines in figure 1 .",
    "fraction of total number of @xmath1 ray and proton showers that pass this cut , i.e. , fraction of showers with radii below the threshold as well as the number of showers simulated in each case are also tabulated .",
    "the last row in the table shows the quality factor estimated for primaries chosen from a powerlaw spectrum as mentioned before .",
    "this is consistent with that for mono - energetic primaries showing that a change in the height of shower maximum with energy does not change the quality factor significantly .",
    "1 shows the distributions of the fitted radii of curvature of the shower front for proton primaries and @xmath22 primaries with respect to that for @xmath1ray primaries of equivalent erenkov yield .",
    "the vertical lines represent the threshold value with respect to which quality factors are estimated .",
    "one can see a rather high degree of overlap between the pair of distributions and hence the quality factors from this parameter are rather modest in value but are almost independent of primary energy .",
    "however we will see in  7.1 that the use of a circular mask to limit the telescope opening angle improves the quality factor at all energies .",
    "also the quality factor against @xmath22 primaries improves dramatically suggesting that this could be the ideal parameter to discriminate heavy primaries .",
    "although the quality factors for individual parameters are not very large by themselves , by applying them in tandem would greatly augment the detection sensitivity of ground based vhe @xmath1ray telescopes designed to exploit the wavefront sampling techniques .",
    "table 17 demonstrates the improvement in the quality factor when the decay time and the timing jitter are applied successively to the same sample of showers .",
    "the dramatic improvement in the quality factor exhibits the orthogonal nature of the parameters .",
    "the separation efficiency seems to decrease with increasing altitude of observation mainly because of the decreasing prominence of the hump in the case of electromagnetic showers .",
    "this , once again supports the earlier conclusion that the erenkov photons around the hump region are more sensitive to photonic primaries",
    ". hence sampling of photons from this region of the light pool is recommended for better discrimination of hadronic primaries .",
