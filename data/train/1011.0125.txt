    "magnetic fields play a crucial role in the star formation process .",
    "magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations have shown that molecular outflows and jets , which are ubiquitously observed in star forming regions , are launched by the magnetic lorentz force @xcite .",
    "furthermore , excess angular momentum of the molecular core of a star forming region is transferred by magnetic braking and the rotation rate is reduced to that observed for rotating stars @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of molecular outflows has not yet been determined observationally .",
    "there are at least two major models for explaining molecular outflows . in the first model , the molecular outflow",
    "is accelerated by the magnetic lorentz force , in the region in which the magnetic field and gas are well coupled ( magnetically driven molecular outflow ) .",
    "this mechanism begins to work after the formation of the first core , which is the first hydrostatic object made of hydrogen molecules in the process of star formation @xcite , due to a combination of the magnetic field and rotational motion around the first core . before the formation of the first core , or in the isothermal runaway collapse phase ,",
    "no molecular outflow is launched .",
    "the second model is based on the idea that the jet is a primary object and its linear momentum is transferred to the ambient gas to form a bipolar molecular outflow ( entrainment model ) .",
    "the well - collimated jet is thought to be magnetically accelerated @xcite . in the entrainment model , the commonly observed wide opening angles in molecular outflows can not be explained by the simple idea of momentum transfer @xcite , since the jet is well collimated and its width is much smaller than that of the molecular outflow .",
    "a number of variations on the entrainment model have been proposed to address this problem , such as turbulent entrainment @xcite and entrainment through a bow shock @xcite .",
    "comparisons are made between observed molecular outflows and models @xcite , which indicate that a part of the molecular outflows have observational signatures consistent with jet - driven origin .",
    "the magnetic drive model , however , can solve the angular momentum problem of newborn stars , as excess angular momentum , which must be greatly reduced to form stars , is removed to a distance by the magnetic torque and the molecular outflow @xcite .    to explore the formation mechanism of molecular outflows , we need observational evidence to distinguish the above two models . the magnetically driven molecular outflow model predicts ( 1 ) rotation of the molecular outflow and ( 2 ) a toroidal magnetic field especially near the acceleration region .",
    "although there are several observations of jet rotation @xcite , only a few observations have been made on the rotation of molecular outflows .",
    "@xcite observed a molecular outflow around a t - tauri star in a dark cloud named cb26 and found in an intensity - weighted velocity map of @xmath1 that two lobes of the molecular outflow have systematic rotation with the same orientation as the high - density circumstellar disk rotation .",
    "this seems to indicate a twisted magnetic field due to the rotation of the high - density disk exerting a torque on the molecular material .",
    "further direct evidence of magnetic driven outflows is the existence of a strong toroidal magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic torque ( or toroidal lorentz force ) arises from the combination of the poloidal current and poloidal magnetic field , and the poloidal current does not exist without a toroidal magnetic field .",
    "thus , the magnetic acceleration region must be characterized by a toroidal magnetic field as well as a poloidal magnetic field . in the present paper",
    ", we demonstrate the characteristics of the configuration of a magnetic field driving the molecular outflow ( i.e. a magnetic field consisting of both poloidal and toroidal components ) in polarization observations of thermal dust emission .",
    "if we compare these predictions with observations , we can distinguish which model is suitable for molecular outflows .",
    "this is done by post - processing the numerical results of an mhd simulation .",
    "we call this procedure `` observational visualization , '' which is a visualization process of the numerical results to explain the undergoing physics but also emphasizing the observational expectations from the simulation . in the observations of the magnetic field , we focus on the polarization of thermal dust radiation , which gives information about the configuration of the magnetic field",
    ". the strength of the magnetic field obtained from zeeman splitting measurements will be presented in a future paper .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we describe the molecular outflow model and summarize the results of mhd simulations .",
    "we also describe the numerical method for calculating the polarization of thermal dust radiation . in section 3 , we present the results of the observation visualization .",
    "section 4 is devoted to discussing the distribution of the polarization degree and the characteristic features of the magnetically driven molecular outflow .",
    "we have presented calculations of the evolution of a rotating magnetized axisymmetric isothermal cloud in @xcite , which is hereafter referred to as paper i. in paper i , we assumed a cloud in hydrostatic balance characterized by dimensionless parameters to specify the magnetic field strength , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are the magnetic flux density , gas density , and isothermal sound speed ) , and the rotation rate , @xmath6 ( @xmath7^{1/2}$ ] represents the characteristic free - fall time - scale for the initial surface density of the cloud @xmath8 , @xmath9 represents the angular rotation speed at the center ) .",
    "figure [ fig : density ] illustrates the evolution of model ah1 from paper i with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the parameters of this model correspond to a central density of @xmath12 , surface density of @xmath13 , magnetic field strength at the center of @xmath14 , rotation rate at the center of @xmath15 , and isothermal sound speed of @xmath16 .",
    "the evolution is divided into two phases : before and after the first core formation .",
    "the figure shows the structure just before the first core formation ( fig.[fig : density](a ) ) and when @xmath17 has passed after the first core formation ( fig.[fig : density](b ) ) . before the first core forms",
    ", we observe a nested disk system composed of two disks , cocentered and bounded by different accretion shocks ( the half thickness of the thinner disk is @xmath18 and that of the thicker disk is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 represents the scale height of the initial cloud ) .",
    "this disk is actually a pseudodisk which continues to contract supersonically @xcite . just after the first core forms ( @xmath21 )",
    ", gas begins to be ejected around the core due to the centrifugal force driven by the extra angular momentum transferred by the magnetic tension force ( magnetocentrifugal wind mechanism @xcite ) . at @xmath22 ,",
    "the outflow reaches @xmath23 ( fig.[fig : density](b ) ) . for the kinetic temperature ,",
    "we assume a barotropic gas : an isothermal envelope is assumed with @xmath24 for @xmath25 , although a hydrostatic core ( the first core ) with a small volume has a higher temperature as @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "we then calculate the expected polarization distribution for thermal dust radiation observed from the direction @xmath28 .",
    "figure [ fig : grid ] shows the relationship between the grid used in the mhd simulation ( left ) and the observation grid ( right ) .",
    "the observation is made by integrating along the normal vector @xmath28 .",
    "the vertical and horizontal axes of the observation grid are chosen along the unit vectors @xmath29 the vectors @xmath28 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 form a right - handed coordinate system and the direction of @xmath31 is chosen to be toward the @xmath0-axis .",
    "the direction of @xmath28 is specified by the angle @xmath32 from the @xmath0-axis of the simulation grid , along which the angular momentum and initial magnetic field are directed .",
    "since the model is axisymmetric around the @xmath0-axis , the polarization is only dependent on the elevation angle @xmath32 and independent of the azimuth angle @xmath33 .",
    "we will discuss the case without axisymmetry in a future study .",
    "the polarization is calculated from the stokes @xmath34 and @xmath35 parameters .",
    "assuming a constant emissivity per mass for dust , owing to the global isothermality in the molecular core and optically thin radiation , we substitute the _ relative _ stokes parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( @xcite ) : @xmath38 where the integration is performed along the line - of - sight @xmath28 and the two angles @xmath39 and @xmath40 represent respectively that between the magnetic field and the plane of the sky and that between the projected magnetic field @xmath41 and the @xmath42-axis ( see fig.[fig : psigamma ] ) . from the relative stokes parameters ,",
    "we derive the polarization direction @xmath43 as @xmath44 then , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are solved from equations ( [ eqn : cos2chi ] ) and ( [ eqn : sin2chi ] ) as @xmath47 where @xmath48 ( for @xmath49 ) ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the polarization degree vector is calculated as @xmath50 where @xmath51 represents the ratio of the polarized intensity to the total intensity and is given as @xmath52 from the two integrated quantities @xmath53 the numerical factor @xmath54 is chosen to be @xmath55 to fit the maximum @xmath51 agreeing with the observations of typical dark clouds .",
    "the timescale of the alignment of the dust in the magnetized interstellar medium is not established , especially near the molecular core center where the gas is accelerated .",
    "therefore , we assume the dust grains are aligned in a similar way to the dark cloud .    in conclusion ,",
    "to calculate the polarization , we have to obtain four quantities ( @xmath37 , @xmath36 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 ) integrating numerically along the line - of - sight ( eqs.[[eqn : q ] ] , [ [ eqn : u ] ] , [ [ eqn : sigma ] ] , and [ [ eqn : sigma2 ] ] ) .",
    "this is done on the nested grid hierarchy , in which @xmath58 levels of grid with different spatial resolutions are placed concentrically ( see paper i and fig .  [",
    "fig : grid ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : density ] illustrates the @xmath59 level , which has @xmath60 times finer resolution than the @xmath61 level that covers the whole structure of the cloud . to make a polarization map with the same spatial resolution and the same spatial coverage as the @xmath59 grid , we integrate the above four equations ( eqs.[[eqn : u ] ] , [ [ eqn : q ] ] , [ [ eqn : sigma ] ] , and [ [ eqn : sigma2 ] ] ) along the line - of - sight using all the data in grid levels",
    "this is done by the following procedure with target=5 :    ....      for l=0 , target-1 do begin        integrate from outer to inner boundaries for grid level l      end for      integrate for target grid level      for l = target-1 , 0 , -1 do begin        integrate from inner to outer boundaries for grid level l      end for ....    this procedure was tested by calculating the column density distribution obtained from a spherically symmetric density distribution @xmath63 , with the corresponding column density obtained by a numerical integration .",
    "in figure [ fig : a1o5l332 ] , we plot the polarization at the final period of the isothermal runaway collapse phase just before the first core formation shown in figure [ fig : density](a ) .",
    "the top row shows the distributions of the density and magnetic field seen in the nested grids for the @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 levels .",
    "these show that a pseudodisk in the form of a contracting disk forms in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field in this phase .",
    "the other rows illustrate the polarization degree vectors , showing the directions of the b - vector and their polarization degree , as well as the column density ( black contour lines ) and polarization degree ( false color and white contour lines ) . when a uniform magnetic field is deduced from the thermal dust emission , the radiation s b",
    "- vector gives the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the second to seventh rows represent the results for @xmath68 ( along the @xmath0-axis or the pole - on view ) , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 ( the edge - on view ) , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : a1o5l332 ] shows that the polarization degree observed along the @xmath0-axis is much lower than that observed for @xmath74 .",
    "the reason for this is clear : observing along the @xmath0-axis , the magnetic field runs perpendicular to the celestial plane , which greatly reduces @xmath36 and @xmath37 due to the fact that @xmath75 . in other words",
    ", dust grains do not align in a specific direction on the celestial plane .    in the range @xmath76 , a pseudodisk which is seen in the middle of the top panels",
    "is observed as an elliptical distribution of the column density ( black contour lines ) , which is an effect of the projection .",
    "although the polarization degree has its minimum near the major axis of the column density distribution , the minimum direction does not coincide with the major axis with a difference of @xmath77 . in figure",
    "[ fig : a1o5l332 ] , models with @xmath78 ( near edge - on ) exhibit an hour - glass shape , in which the magnetic field is squeezed near the mid - plane .",
    "however , it should be noted that the deviation from a straight magnetic field is small .",
    "the bottom panels show that the polarization degree varies depending on the heights from the mid - plane .",
    "namely , a low polarization region extends over @xmath79 ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a post - shock region passing an accretion shock appearing at @xmath80 . in the pre - shock region @xmath81",
    ", the magnetic field line is essentially perpendicular to the pseudodisk , while in the post - shock region @xmath82 and @xmath83 are amplified due to compression .",
    "this configuration reduces the polarization degree in the post - shock region .",
    "another accretion shock appears near @xmath84@xmath85 , of which the post - shock region corresponds to a low polarization degree around @xmath86@xmath85 in the @xmath87 grid .      in figure",
    "[ fig : a1o5l1001 ] , we show the polarization obtained after the first core formation .",
    "as shown in the top row , the molecular outflow is ejected in this phase and the outflow reaches @xmath88 in @xmath89 after the core formation , which is seen in the @xmath59 grid . in the @xmath90 grid ,",
    "gas moves outward in the region @xmath91 at @xmath92 , which is connected to a thick outflow lobe seen in the range @xmath93 at the height @xmath94 .",
    "although the pole - on view ( @xmath68 ) exhibits low polarization in figure [ fig : a1o5l332 ] , the central part with radii @xmath95 has a larger polarization degree than the outer part , which is seen in the grids @xmath96 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the toroidal magnetic field is amplified by rotation of the disk at the mid - plane in contrast to the former runaway collapse phase .",
    "the molecular outflow is clearly seen as a region with low polarization degree ( @xmath97 ) extending vertically in the plots of @xmath59 for @xmath98@xmath99 ( compare the panels in the second column from the left ) . outside the molecular outflow ,",
    "the poloidal magnetic field is predominant , while inside the outflow the toroidal magnetic field is dominant .",
    "since the poloidal magnetic field induces larger polarization than the toroidal one if we observe the outflow edge - on , the outflow is seen as a region with low polarization degree .    although the disk is seen in a high polarization degree region in the edge - on view in the range @xmath100 ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) , the disk is composed of a region with low polarization degree looking further inside @xmath101 ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "disk rotation generates the toroidal magnetic field in this region , while outside @xmath102 the poloidal magnetic field is dominant .    between the pole - on and edge - on views ( @xmath103 ) ,",
    "a region with low polarization degree extends in the horizontal direction from the center , similar to the runaway collapse phase .",
    "the panels of @xmath59 for @xmath103 contain a compact @xmath104-scale region with high polarization degree .",
    "this is characteristic of the accretion phase , in contrast with the runaway collapse phase ( fig.[fig : a1o5l332 ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to the acceleration region where the toroidal magnetic field works to accelerate the gas .",
    "this region forms a spiral feature with a radius of @xmath105 au , as seen for @xmath90 .      in figure",
    "[ fig : a001o1l1322 ] , we plot the density and magnetic field lines in the accretion phase of a model with a weak magnetic field ( model eh of paper i ; @xmath106 and @xmath107 ) , which has a ten - times weaker magnetic field than the previous model . that is , the magnetic field strength at the center is equal to @xmath108 and the rotation rate at the center is equal to @xmath109 , if the other parameters are taken to be the same .",
    "the rotation rate of this model is 1/5 that of the previous model .",
    "the outflow reaches @xmath110 in a time scale @xmath111 . owing to the weaker magnetic field ( and relatively slow rotation ) , the density distribution looks nearly spherical ( see the panel of @xmath64 in the top row ) .",
    "mhd simulations have already shown that the relatively weak magnetic field gives an outflow driven by the magnetic pressure gradient in the toroidal component and this outflow is well collimated .",
    "the strong magnetic field induces an outflow driven by the magnetocentrifugal wind , which has a wide opening angle @xcite .",
    "the model in this subsection corresponds to the model of outflows driven by the magnetic pressure gradient .",
    "similar to figure [ fig : a1o5l1001 ] , in figure [ fig : a001o1l1322 ] the outflow is seen as a low - polarization region with @xmath112 ( @xmath59 and @xmath113 ) .",
    "however , the outflow has an interior structure , which is also seen in the third column from the left , i.e. , the @xmath90 grid .",
    "near the rotation axis ( @xmath114 ) , a vertical structure with a relatively high polarization degree ( 10% ) is seen .",
    "since the polarization b - vector in this region is in the horizontal direction , it appears to arise from the toroidal magnetic field compressed near the @xmath0-axis .",
    "the toroidal field runs perpendicular to the celestial plane in the region @xmath115 , which reduces the polarization degree in this region .    in the edge - on view",
    ", a disk is traced as a region with high polarization @xmath116 ( @xmath73 in the @xmath64 and @xmath65 levels ) .",
    "similar to the previous model , a high polarization disk is truncated inside @xmath117 . in this region ,",
    "rotation and thus the toroidal magnetic field seem to predominate and reduce the polarization degree .    between @xmath69 and @xmath72",

    "similar to the previous model , the direction of the low polarization degree and that of the major axis differ up to @xmath118 .",
    "although the distributions of both density and magnetic field are axisymmetric , the polarization distribution is not symmetric with respect to the @xmath42-axis .",
    "this seems strange at first glance . in this subsection",
    ", we consider this problem .    in figures [ fig:0332a1o5l3poltor ] and [ fig:1001a1o5l5poltor ] , we plot the expected polarization map for the model shown in figures [ fig : a1o5l332 ] and [ fig : a1o5l1001 ] ( model ah1 ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "the left column is a plot of the results , while the middle and right columns are results obtained from artificial data consisting of the poloidal magnetic field without the toroidal field ( middle : hereafter we call it a poloidal model ) and from data consisting of the toroidal magnetic field without the poloidal field ( right : hereafter we call it a toroidal model ) .    in the case of",
    "neither pole - on nor edge - on ( i.e. , @xmath119 ) , the polarization degree distribution shown in the left column exhibits point symmetry rather than mirror symmetry . if we exclude the toroidal magnetic field ( poloidal model ) or exclude the poloidal magnetic field ( toroidal model ) , we observe mirror symmetry with respect to the @xmath42-axis .",
    "hence , only the true data , consisting of both the poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields , gives a polarization distribution without mirror symmetry .",
    "namely , co - existing poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields induce this asymmetry .    the toroidal model ( figs .",
    "[ fig:0332a1o5l3poltor ] and [ fig:1001a1o5l5poltor ] ) exhibits a vertical bar structure with a strong polarization degree ( the cases @xmath70 and @xmath73 of the toroidal model ) . integrating the toroidal magnetic field",
    ", the polarization in the horizontal direction has a peak on the @xmath42-axis , since the magnetic field is parallel to the celestial plane and the column density has a maximum there .",
    "the distributions in the left and middle columns show some similarity , in contrast to the right column .",
    "for example , for @xmath73 , a pseudodisk is observed with a similar structure , exhibiting a polarization degree decrease followed by an increase , rising from the mid - plane .",
    "this indicates that the magnetic field can be regarded essentially as being poloidal in this run - away collapse phase .",
    "observing from @xmath70 in the direction of a major axis of the disk , the polarization degree is low .",
    "the polarization distributions in the accretion phase are shown in figures [ fig:1001a1o5l5poltor ] and [ fig:1322a001o1l6poltor ] , which correspond to models ah1 ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and eh ( @xmath106 and @xmath107 ) , respectively . in figure",
    "[ fig:1001a1o5l5poltor ] , an outflow lobe is seen in the left column @xmath120 and also in the middle column as a low - polarization region .",
    "the fact that the lobe has a low polarization even in the poloidal model indicates that the low polarization is due to cancellation between the foreground and background .",
    "that is , the toroidal field component @xmath121 is mapped to a negative @xmath122 in the foreground but is mapped to a positive @xmath123 in the background .",
    "figure [ fig : pol ] shows how the mirror symmetry breaks in a magnetic field consisting of poloidal and toroidal components . in this figure",
    ", we consider a magnetic field consisting of @xmath3 and @xmath82 and assume @xmath124 const and @xmath82 changes its sign for @xmath125 and @xmath126 , which is obtained when the outflow is ejected by the magnetic lorentz force . two points ( r@xmath127 and r@xmath128 ) are taken at symmetric positions with respect to the mid - plane ( and also l@xmath127 and l@xmath128 ) .",

    "the magnetocentrifugal wind acceleration mechanism applies . in a molecular core with a weak magnetic field , @xmath132 ,",

    ", the strength of the toroidal component dominates the poloidal component in the molecular outflow .",
    "that is , the configuration of the magnetic field @xmath133 exhibits a characteristic signature of magnetically driven molecular outflow .",
    "a toroidal dominant magnetic field gives a point - symmetric polarization distribution rather than a mirror - symmetric one .",
    "as we have found , a purely poloidal magnetic field recovers a mirror symmetry with respect to the @xmath134axis .",
    "thus , the predominance of a toroidal magnetic field is imprinted in the disk around the protostar .",
    "however , the direction of the major axis of the total intensity of the disk and the extension of the region with low polarization degree should first be compared .",
    "if the disk has a point symmetric polarization distribution rather than a mirror symmetric one , this indicates that a relatively strong toroidal magnetic field has been generated in the gaseous disk .",
    "another signature is a low polarization degree in the molecular outflow .",
    "if the coupling between dust and magnetic field is complete , this indicates a predominance of a toroidal magnetic field in the molecular outflow . even if the dust alignment in the contracting envelope is the same as in the dark cloud , the alignment in the molecular outflow might be incomplete . even in this case",
    ", the molecular outflow has to have a low polarization degree .",
    "based on two - dimensional axisymmetric mhd simulations , we calculated the polarization pattern expected in observations of thermal dust emission .",
    "we developed a procedure to calculate stokes parameters on a nested grid hierarchy .",
    "the distribution of the polarization degree has an apparent signature indicating a toroidal component dominated magnetic field in the acceleration region of the molecular outflow .",
    "the outflow must have a lower polarization degree than the envelope .",
    "another signature is imprinted on the disk whose rotation amplifies the toroidal magnetic field and thus accelerates the gas . a point - symmetric rather than a mirror - symmetric distribution of the low polarization degree region is another signature of a toroidal dominated magnetic field .",
    "if these characteristic features are observed , such a molecular outflow has toroidal - dominated magnetic field and is likely to be driven by the magnetic lorentz force rather than the entrainment mechanism .",

    "<S> the observational expectation of polarization measurements of thermal dust radiation is investigated to find information on molecular outflows based on magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) and radiation transfer simulations . </S>",
    "<S> there are two major proposed models for the driving of molecular outflows : ( 1 ) molecular gas is accelerated by a magnetic pressure gradient or magnetocentrifugal wind mechanism before the magnetic field and molecular gas are decoupled , ( 2 ) the linear momentum of a highly collimated jet is transferred to the ambient molecular gas . in order to distinguish between these two models , it is crucial to observe the configuration of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> an observation of a toroidal magnetic field is strong evidence that the first of the models is appropriate . in this paper , we calculated the polarization distribution of thermal dust radiation due to the alignment of dust grains along the magnetic field using molecular outflow data calculated by two - dimensional axisymmetric mhd simulations . </S>",
    "<S> an asymmetric distribution around the @xmath0-axis is characteristic for magnetic fields composed of both poloidal and toroidal components . </S>",
    "<S> we determined that the outflow has a low polarization degree compared with the envelope and that the envelope and outflow have different polarization directions ( b - vector ) , namely , the magnetic field within the envelope is parallel to the global magnetic field lines while the magnetic field of the outflow is perpendicular to it . </S>",
    "<S> thus we have demonstrated that the point - symmetric ( rather than axisymmetric ) distributions of low polarization regions indicate that molecular outflows are likely to be magnetically driven . </S>",
    "<S> observations of this polarization distribution with tools such as alma would confirm the origin of the molecular outflow . </S>"
