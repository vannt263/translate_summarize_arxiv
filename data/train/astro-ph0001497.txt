    "during the period between 7 and 94 days after v - band maximum , we have seen that sn  1998bw resembles other ic sne sufficiently to support this classification , but has unusually slow spectral evolution . on day 94",
    "we see the emergence of a nebular spectrum , which retains many of the characteristics of the photospheric period . the late onset of the supernebular phase , compared to sn  1987 m ( 62  d ) and sn  1994i ( 56",
    "d ) , is consistent with the ejection of an unusually large mass , as predicted by lightcurve models @xcite .    by day 19 , sn  1998bw blueshifts are up to 50% larger than other ic sne . however , increased blueshifts alone seem insufficient to explain the unusually smooth and blended spectrum which persists to late times  for instance sn  1998bw on day 19 has similar blueshifts to sn  1987 m on day 11 , but sn  1987 m has well defined spectral features .",
    "emission line widths on day 94 are 45% broader than sn  1994i and sn  1987 m and na  i absorption is far broader in sn  1998bw on day 94 than in sn  1987 m at similar epochs .",
    "the line profiles of sn  1998bw may have disproportionally strong absorption wings  we lack an example of an unblended feature at earlier times for confirmation . using the standard model for a homologously expanding envelope , absorption lines which are broader but of similar blueshift",
    "imply that the absorption region in sn  1998bw spans a larger range of velocity space , at both higher and lower velocities than other ic sne , as expected for a massive envelope . a closer inspection of the 7000  9000   region of sn  1998bw suggests that we are also seeing contribution from enhanced line species .",
    "unusually strong lines from species such as n  i , c  ii , c  iii , ti  ii and cr  ii may help to produce the extensive line blending .",
    "if so , this could indicate an overabundance of these elements , or unusual physical properties of the ejecta .",
    "more work is required in establishing line identifications and spectral characteristics , best done using spectral models .",
    "whether or not sn  1998bw was associated with grb 980425 , it is of great interest as an extreme example of ic sne .",
    "sn  1997ef bears some resemblance to sn  1998bw and may be an intermediate object between sn  1998bw and classical sne , though it is too early to say whether we are seeing a bimodal or continuous variation in properties .",
    "thanks to the interest inspired by the @xmath0-ray burst , sn  1998bw has been observed extensively and successful modelling of this object is likely to enhance our understanding of this relatively poorly observed class of supernova .",
    "we thank the observers at the aat , ukst and mso 2.3-m telescope who kindly donated their time to our project .",
    "we thank alejandro clocchiatti , craig wheeler , jodie martin and paolo mazzali for providing digital supernova data to compare with our observations , and peter meikle , david branch and brian schmidt for helpful discussions .",

    "<S> sn 1998bw holds the record for the most energetic type ic explosion , one of the brightest radio supernovae and probably the first supernova associated with a @xmath0-ray burst . in this paper </S>",

    "<S> we investigate the evolution of the spectrum between 7 and 94 days after v - band maximum in comparison to well - studied examples of type ic sne in order to quantify the unusual properties of this supernova event . </S>",
    "<S> though the early spectra differ greatly from observations of classical ic sne , we find that the evolution from the photospheric to nebular phases is slow but otherwise typical . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra differ predominantly in the extensive line blending and blanketing which has been attributed to the high velocity of the ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> we find that by day 19 , the absorption line minima blueshifts are 10%  50% higher then other sne and on day 94 emission lines are 45% broader , as expected if the progenitor had a massive envelope . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is difficult to explain the extent of line blanketing entirely by line broadening , and we argue that additional contribution from other species is present , indicating unusual relative abundances or physical conditions in the envelope .    </S>",

    "<S> the blueshift is significantly greater , but in the residual spectrum the profile is similar to sn  1994i , so apparent differences are probably due to contribution from the persisting photospheric features . </S>",
    "<S> the ca  ii ] to [ oi ] ratio is greater in sn  1987 m than in sn  1994i and sn  1998bw , which has been attributed to a difference in the relative abundances of calcium and oxygen @xcite . while mg  i ] @xmath84571 is the usual identification for the emission peak at 4500    @xcite , an alternative identification is given by patat et al . </S>",

    "<S> na  i emerges as a p - cygni profile between days 19 and 94 , evolving more slowly in equivalent width and in emission to absorption ratio than sn  1987 m and sn  1994i . a noticable difference between sn  1998bw and sn  1987 m is the width of the absorption component of na  i , which is only half the width in sn  1987 m , and considerably narrower than the emission lines .    </S>",
    "<S> the peak at 5200   has been tentatively identified as fe  ii @xmath85215 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this transition is typically seen in older ia sne , but not in ic sne , and patat and piemonte note that its presence would indicate that sn  1998bw was a type iac sn . however , the feature is also present in sn  1987 m and more weakly in sn  1994i during the early nebular phase . </S>",
    "<S> it fades relative to mg  i ] , [ o  i ] and ca  ii ] at later times . </S>",
    "<S> it therefore seems reasonable to assume that the presence of fe  ii emission in ic sne spectra is typical during the transition from the photospheric to the nebular phase . in the residual spectrum ( figure  5 ) </S>",
    "<S> the feature is weaker relative to the 4500    peak and has a markedly different profile . </S>",
    "<S> this supports the identification of the 4500 and 5200    peaks as transitions of different species , and indicates that the 5200    peak is fading and/or is artificially enhanced by a relatively high continuum level .      </S>",
    "<S> the red spectral region of sn  1998bw is shown in figure  6 for days 7 and 19 . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath87774 and ca  ii @xmath68498 , 8542 , 8662 are well separated by an absorption free region missing in sn  1998bw . </S>",
    "<S> iwamoto et al have successfully modelled this region for day  @xmath11 with a photospheric velocity of 28000 km  s@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> however , by day  @xmath12 their model predicts that the two features should be resolved , and that by day  7 o  i and ca  ii are unblended . similar evolution is predicted by the direct analysis models of branch . in sn  1997ef this behaviour is seen , with blended absorption on day  3 and well separated features on day  30 @xcite . in sn  </S>",
    "<S> 1998bw , however , there is no sign of significant separation as late as day  19 , our last epoch covering this region .    </S>",
    "<S> while it is presumably possible to fit this region by increasing the mass of the progenitor , and therefore the line widths of the o  i and ca  ii profiles , there are two limitations which need to be considered . </S>",
    "<S> the first is that we do not expect to see redshifted absorption from a simple expanding envelope . under this assumption , o  i can not contribute to the absorption band redward of 7774   , irrespective of the line width . </S>",
    "<S> the second limitation is that we detect a shallow dip at @xmath108100    which we identify as the minimum of the ca  ii absorption . </S>",
    "<S> this feature aligns well with the ca  ii @xmath63933 , 3968 line profile , and the velocity of @xmath13 km  s@xmath3 is already higher than blueshifts of other lines at this epoch ( table  3 ) .    in order to reproduce the spectrum on day 19 we would require a highly unusual geometry to produce redshifted absorption from o  i , or to produce ca  ii absorption with a second minimum at around @xmath14 km  s@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative explanation is the presence of a third component absorbing at around 7700  8000  . </S>",
    "<S> adequate fits can be produced with lines of rest wavelength 8000  8350  , and candidate species include c  ii , c  iii and n  i. a relatively weak contribution from any of these species would result in the blended spectrum we observe . </S>",
    "<S> modelling is required to further investigate this region , and to determine whether unusual abundances , density or temperature distribution can explain the observations . </S>"
