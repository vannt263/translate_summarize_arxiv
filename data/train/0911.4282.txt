    "the operator @xmath9 with the neumann boundary condition at @xmath10 is self - adjoint on @xmath11 ; therefore , its resolvent @xmath12 is a bounded operator from @xmath13 to @xmath14 for @xmath15 not in the spectrum of @xmath9 .",
    "this resolvent can be extended meromorphically as an operator @xmath16 to @xmath17 with isolated poles of finite rank ; these poles are called * resonances*. ( the reader is referred to @xcite for details . ) to each resonance @xmath18 corresponds a * resonant state * ; that is , a nonzero @xmath19 solving the equation @xmath20 with the neumann boundary condition at the right endpoint and with the following * outgoing condition * at @xmath21 : @xmath22 ( note that for @xmath23 , @xmath24 solves the free equation @xmath25 , so it must be a linear combination of @xmath26 . )    for @xmath27 , the outgoing condition implies that @xmath24 is exponentially decreasing on the negative half - line and thus @xmath28 ; therefore , @xmath18 is a pole ( of the resolvent ) lying in the upper half - plane if and only if @xmath15 is an eigenvalue of @xmath9 on @xmath13 . since @xmath9 is self - adjoint ,",
    "all poles in the upper half - plane have to lie on the imaginary axis . there may be poles @xmath18 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 ; however , we will restrict our attention to purely imaginary resonances :    a positive number @xmath31 is called a * bound state * if @xmath32 is a pole of the resolvent @xmath33 , and an * antibound state * if @xmath34 is a pole .",
    "we see from above that @xmath31 is an ( anti)bound state if and only if there exists a nonzero solution @xmath24 of the problem @xmath35 the plus sign in ( [ e : leftcondo ] ) corresponds to an antibound state and the minus sign corresponds to a bound state .",
    "we will also study neumann eigenvalues of @xmath9 on @xmath8 $ ] ; i.e. , those @xmath31 for which there exists a nonzero solution to ( [ e : equation ] ) with boundary conditions ( [ e : rightcond ] ) and @xmath36    since the space of solutions to  ( [ e : equation ] ) and  ( [ e : rightcond ] ) is always one dimensional , * bound states , antibound states , and neumann eigenvalues never coincide*. however , bindel and zworski proved in @xcite that bound and antibound states located away from zero coincide modulo errors of order @xmath37 for some @xmath38 , if the potential satisfies the following conditions : @xmath39,\\\\ \\exists \\varepsilon>0:v(x)=0\\text { for all } x\\in ( a , a+\\varepsilon ) .",

    "figure  1 shows two potentials on the whole line , each supported in @xmath50 $ ] , and the corresponding bound states ( denoted by squares ) and antibound states ( denoted by circles ) .",
    "the vertical coordinate of each ( anti)bound state on the picture corresponds to its value @xmath31 ; the horizontal coordinate corresponds to the value of @xmath51 used .",
    "we see that the conclusion of the theorem does not appear to hold for the potential on the left , which does not satify the bump condition ; at the same time , it is true for the potential on the right .",
    "theorem  1 , formulated for the half - line case , applies to these numerical experiments on the whole line since for even potentials , the set of their ( anti)bound states is composed of these states for the positive half - line with dirichlet condition and the same states for the neumann condition ; the theorem above can be applied with dirichlet condition in place of ( [ e : rightcond ] ) .",
    "( however , condition ( [ e : leftcondn ] ) can not be replaced by dirichlet condition in the theorem . )",
    "the study of resonances in one dimension has a long tradition going back to origins of quantum mechanics , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "one of the first studies of their distribution was conducted by regge  @xcite ; since then , there have been many mathematical results on the topic , including  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "concerning antibound states , hitrik has shown in  @xcite that for a positive compactly supported potential , there are no antibound states in the semiclassical limit .",
    "this agrees with our result since there are no bound states in this case .",
    "simon proved in  @xcite that between any two bound states , there must be an odd number of antibound states ; the following corollary of this result follows almost immediately using the methods we develop to prove theorem  1 :    [ l : simon ] consider the half - line problem with a bounded compactly supported potential @xmath1 ( which does not need to satisfy any positivity condition ) .",
    "then for each two bound states @xmath52 , the interval @xmath53 contains at least one antibound state . in particular , if there are @xmath54 bound states in some subinterval of @xmath55 , then there are at least @xmath56 antibound states in the same subinterval",
    ".    the proof of theorem 1 works as follows : we study the evolution ( in @xmath4 ) of the vectors @xmath57 for the three solutions of ( [ e : equation ] ) with initial data at @xmath58 satisfying the conditions ( [ e : leftcondo ] ) and ( [ e : leftcondn ] ) .",
    "the idea is to look at these three vectors at @xmath59 . since @xmath60 on the interval @xmath61 , the transition matrix for the considered vectors from @xmath58 to @xmath59 will have an expanding and a contracting direction .",
    "( in fact , if we introduce rescaling @xmath62 , then the behavior of the original system for small @xmath63 is similar to the behavior of the rescaled system for large @xmath64 , and the latter will be similar to the behavior of the geodesic flow on a two - dimensional manifold of negative curvature . )",
    "it turns out that our three vectors lie in a certain angle between the expanding and the contracting directions , from which it follows that they will stay in this angle for later times ( lemma  [ l : estimate ] ) ; what is more , their polar angles will get exponentially close to each other ( lemma  [ l : close ] ) . finally , we can study how the polar angles of the considered vectors change with @xmath31 ( lemma  [ l : angle ] ) : it follows ( lemma  [ l : nondegenerate ] ) that the polar angle for the solution with neumann initial data at @xmath58 will strictly increase in @xmath31 and the polar angle for the solution with the same data at @xmath65 will decrease in @xmath31 .",
    "the proof is then completed by a pertrubation argument ( lemma  [ l : perturb ] ) .",
    "the detailed proofs of theorems  [ l : main ] and  [ l : simon ] are given in section  3 .",
    "both are elementary and use certain properties of ordinary differential equations presented in section  2 .",

    "throughout this section , @xmath66 is an interval in @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath6 , and @xmath70 .",
    "any solution to the equation @xmath71 is determined by the vector @xmath57 at any @xmath4 ; we will sometimes view this vector in polar coordinates :    [ d : langle ] define the * length * @xmath72 and the * polar angle * @xmath73 by the equations @xmath74 here @xmath73 lies in the circle @xmath75 .",

    "the next lemma tells us that if the vector @xmath57 falls inside a certain angle in the plane at the initial time , then it will stay inside that angle for all later times :    [ l : estimate ] suppose that @xmath80 for all @xmath81 and some constants @xmath82 .",
