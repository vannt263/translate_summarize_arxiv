    "numerical analysis is an immensely exciting area of research with many intellectual and practical benefits and yet this excitement sometimes does nt come across in courses and textbooks .",
    "one reason is that courses and texts sometimes do not indicate some of the frontiers of the field and why these frontiers are interesting .",
    "perhaps more importantly , few introductory courses and texts make students aware that they are actually close to , and can contribute to , research frontiers even while participating in an introductory course .",
    "the ease of finding and exploring new problems in numerical analysis is one of its particular attractions .    as an illustration of this point that we hope will be of pedagogical interest to those teaching and thinking about numerical analysis",
    ", we pose and partially solve a question that was raised by the attractive cover picture of the book by kincaid and cheney @xcite .",
    "( this book has been used at duke university for the last few years in its graduate introductory course on numerical analysis ; the first author was a recent student in this course when it was taught by the second author . )",
    "this cover picture is reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig : newton ]     in the square region defined by @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the positions of the roots of unity are indicated by the small black squares .",
    "this figure was computed numerically by using a mesh of @xmath3 pixels inside this square .",
    "the center point of each pixel was used to start a newton iteration under eq .",
    "( [ eq : newton - mapping ] ) .",
    "the pixel was assigned a particular basin color if convergence to a root was identified within 1000  iterations .",
    "the criterion for convergence was that both the magnitudes of the correction  @xmath4 and of the residual @xmath5 were smaller than the value  @xmath6 .",
    "the boundaries separating the basins are intricately braided , with a fractal dimension of  @xmath7 . ,",
    "width=336 ]    and reveals a remarkable result that is now nearly 120  years old @xcite : for the simple polynomial equation  @xmath0 in the complex plane , the sets of points  @xmath8 that converge to a root under the map given by newton s method , @xmath9 have an unexpected intricate geometric complexity . in the language of nonlinear dynamics @xcite , the set of points that converge towards a fixed point under successive iterations of some mapping is called the _ basin of attraction _ of that fixed point .",
    "[ fig : newton ] then says graphically that the basins of attraction for newton s method are bounded by intricately braided objects .",
    "naively , one would have expected the basins of attraction to be given by the sets of points closest to a given root and so bounded by straight lines .",
    "this braided structure is typical of geometric objects known as fractals @xcite .",
    "the concept of a fractal is hard to define rigorously @xcite but can be casually defined as a scale - invariant set that has a non - integer dimension  @xmath10 known as its fractal dimension . for fig .",
    "[ fig : newton ] , scale invariance corresponds to the fact that if any small region of the braided structure is greatly magnified , further braided structure is found of a similar complexity and there is no end to this intricate detail upon further and further magnification .",
    "the fractal dimension is perhaps best understood as a scaling exponent that generalizes the usual concept of dimension to non - integer values @xcite .",
    "e.g. , one kind of fractal dimension known as the capacity  @xmath11 indicates the scaling  @xmath12 as  @xmath13 of the minimum number of balls  @xmath14 of radius  @xmath15 needed to cover the set as the ball radius  @xmath15 tends to zero if this limit exists . in practice ,",
    "one computes numerically a sequence of values  @xmath16 for different radii  @xmath17 and then estimates the dimension from the slope of a least - squares linear fit to a plot of  @xmath18 versus  @xmath19 . ] .",
    "numerical calculations of the capacity of a set are often slowly convergent when the points of the set are visited with non - uniform probability ( measure ) by the dynamics @xcite .",
    "for this reason , in the following we have used the average pointwise dimension  @xmath10 @xcite to quantify the structure of the fractal basin boundaries .",
    "this dimension takes into account the probability of visiting different parts of a set and so is more rapidly convergent in practice .",
    "is defined by the limit  @xmath20 if this limit exists , where the quantity  @xmath21 is the density or probability of points in a ball of radius  @xmath15 , i.e. , the ratio of the number of points in the ball to the total number of points in the set . ] .",
    "another interesting aspect of the fractal structure in fig .  [ fig : newton ] is that the boundaries satisfy the counterintuitive wada property @xcite : every point on the boundary of one basin of attraction is also on the boundary of the other basins of attraction .",
    "the kincaid and cheney book touches only briefly on these remarkable facts and does not mention that fractal basins are in fact typical for newton methods , rather than rare or pathological .",
    "some of the important ( and largely numerical ) discoveries in the field of nonlinear dynamics in the last twenty years is that fractal structures pop up over and over again for nonlinear equations and for typical choices of equation parameters and of initial conditions : basin boundaries can be fractal , the attracting limit set for maps , flows , and partial differential equations can be fractal , and the set of parameter values that lead to a particular class of solutions ( e.g. , fixed points ) can be fractal @xcite .",
    "this fractal structure has important practical implications for many numerical problems and algorithms and so numerical analysis students should be aware of this . as one example , fractal basins of attraction for newton s method imply that it will generally be difficult or impractical to characterize the ever - so - important initial guesses that will lead to convergence . in some extreme cases , it may be impossible to characterize the dependence of the algorithm or even of a laboratory experiment on parameters @xcite .",
    "[ fig : newton ] is a good example of a result that is easily computed by students in an introductory numerical analysis course and that leads to interesting , and largely unexplored , questions that might entice a student to get interested in numerical analysis .",
    "thinking about this figure carefully raises the following kinds of questions : are fractal boundaries associated with newton s method rare or common ? what determines the braided geometric structure ( e.g. , its fractal dimension  @xmath10 ) ?",
    "do other root - finding algorithms lead to such fractal structure and , if so , can one relate the details of the algorithm to the fractal geometry ? how do floating point errors affect the fractal structure ? what are the implications of these fractal basin boundaries for root - finding software ?    in the following , we address briefly one of the above questions , namely do different root - finding algorithms  particularly newton s method with damping  also lead to fractal basins of attraction ?",
    "a well known weakness of newton s method is that it is locally , but rarely globally , convergent @xcite .",
    "to improve this situation , researchers have invented damping methods @xcite that try to increase the likelihood that an initial condition will lead to convergence .",
    "the basic strategy of most damping methods is to add only a fraction of a newton step when correcting the current estimate of a root . during successive iterations ,",
    "the damping algorithm usually increases the fraction of the newton step towards the value of one until full newton steps are taken and quadratic convergence is achieved .",
    "a question which , to our knowledge , seems not to have been discussed previously is then this : for fixed points with fractal basins of attraction , do damping methods change the fractal structure ?",
    "if so , do they diminish or increase the fractal dimension  @xmath10 of the boundaries ?",
    "an interesting related question is whether damping works by increasing the basin of attraction , in that the basin with damping strictly contains the basin without damping .",
    "an increase in the fractal dimension  @xmath10 would possibly be an undesirable effect since more initial conditions would lie near the boundaries , making it harder to find criteria for identifying good initial conditions , which is often the most challenging part of a newton method for many scientific problems .",
    "the question of how damping may modify the fractal basins of attraction is a natural one to ask given material normally covered in an introductory numerical analysis course and is also within the ability of students to investigate themselves .",
    "to study numerically and graphically how the basins of attraction may be modified by damping , we consider one of the simplest damping methods , the armijo rule @xcite . for the equation  @xmath22 , the armijo rule modifies the newton algorithm ( [ eq : newton - mapping ] ) by introducing a fractional damping coefficient  @xmath23 in front of the newton step as follows : @xmath24 where  @xmath25 is a nonnegative integer . before the approximate root  @xmath26",
    "is corrected to give a new and hopefully better estimate  @xmath27 , the integer  @xmath25 is increased from zero ( i.e. , the fraction of the step added is decreased ) until the following criterion is just satisfied : @xmath28 at this point , @xmath27 is computed from eq .",
    "( [ eq : armijo ] ) with the given value of  @xmath25 and the newton method is iterated until convergence or some maximum limit of iterations is attained .",
    "( if the latter , then usually a new initial condition must be tried . ) under certain assumptions of smoothness , one can prove that the armijo method is guaranteed to converge to some root @xcite .     under armijo s rule , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : armijo ] ) and  ( [ eq : armijo - convergence ] ) , calculated in the same way as described in fig .",

    "[ fig : newton ] .",

    "[ fig : armijo ] ) with those of the newton algorithm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : newton ] ) yields several interesting insights .",
    "first , the basin boundaries are not smoothed out under damping but retain a fractal structure .",
    "second , although the basins themselves are substantially altered ( there are larger contiguous regions of a given color in fig .  [",
    "fig : armijo ] compared to fig .",
    "[ fig : newton ] ) , damping causes only a modest change in the basin boundaries as quantified by the fractal dimension  @xmath10 .",
    "the dimension of the fractal boundaries in fig .",
    "[ fig : armijo ] is  @xmath32 whereas the fractal dimension in fig .",
    "[ fig : newton ] has the somewhat larger value  1.42 .",
    "the approximately ten percent relative decrease in the dimension seems consistent with the expected smoothing effect arising from the armijo factor @xmath33 at each newton - like step .",
    "nevertheless , the dimension of the basin boundary does not generally decrease under damping as we point out in the next section .",
    "our discussion for the polynomial  @xmath0 is somewhat atypical in that there are only three roots and the corresponding basins of attraction are related by symmetry rotations around  @xmath34 . to explore a more representative example and to suggest the rich geometric changes that damping can induce ,",
    "we have also studied numerically the approximate basins of attraction of newton and newton - armijo algorithms for the following two - dimensional nonlinear system : @xmath35   \\label{eq : complex } \\\\[-1.5ex ]   { y - \\cos(x ) \\sinh(y ) } & = & { 0 , } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which the second author first came across in a collection of numerical analysis problems  ( * ? ? ?",

    "if not all basins are linked by the wada property , do the different basin boundaries have different fractal dimensions and , if so , what determines these different dimensions ?    finally , one can again ask how the geometry in fig .  [ fig : c_armijo ] might depend on the damping algorithm . a canonical and interesting choice to study",
