    "recent investigations , performed in the framework of perturbative qcd , show that at low temperatures and asymptotically high values of the quark chemical potential @xmath0 the dense baryonic matter is a color superconductor @xcite .",
    "evidently , at rather small values of @xmath0 a more adequate description of this phenomenon can be done with the help of different effective models , such as nambu  jona - lasinio- ( njl ) type field theories with four - fermionic interaction @xcite , etc . in such a way , on the basis of njl - type models with two quark flavors it was shown that the color superconducting ( 2sc ) phase might be yet present at rather small values of @xmath11 mev , i.e. at baryon densities only several times larger , than the density of ordinary nuclear matter ( see reviews @xcite ) .",
    "( for simplicity , throughout the paper we will study quark matter , composed from two quark flavors , i.e. up- and down quarks , only . )",
    "this is just the density of compact star cores .",
    "so , color superconductivity , which is eventually existing inside compact stars , might influence different observable astrophysical processes , and thus deserves to be studied in more details .    in the early njl approach to color superconductivity @xcite ,",
    "the density of the color charge @xmath12 was not constraint to zero in the 2sc ground state ( the densities of other color charges @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , are zero in this phase @xcite ) leading to a nonvanishing difference between the densities of red / green quarks and blue ones . in this case",
    ", the mesonic and diquark excitations of dense quark matter were considered in the framework of a simple two - flavored njl model with a single quark chemical potential @xmath0 @xcite . in particular , it was shown that in the color asymmetric 2sc phase of this model does arise an abnormal number of three nambu  goldstone bosons ( ng ) instead of expected five , color symmetry is spontaneously broken down to the @xmath15 one , so one might expect naively five massless bosons . however , due to lorentz noninvariance of the system , there are indeed only three ng bosons . ] and @xmath4-mesons are stable excitations of its ground state with masses @xmath16 mev . besides , there are two light stable scalar diquark modes , whose masses are proportional to @xmath17 , as well as one heavy scalar diquark resonance in the 2sc phase .    in reality , however , i.e. possibly in compact star cores or in relativistic heavy ion experiments , there are several physical constraints on the quark matter .",
    "the most evident one is its color neutrality , which means a vanishing of a bulk @xmath13 color charges ( @xmath18 ) . indeed , since the lump of quark matter , which might be created after heavy ion collisions , originated from color neutral objects and is surrounded by a color neutral medium , it is expected to be globally color neutral . to fulfill this requirement , usually the local color neutrality constraint is imposed by introducing several new chemical potentials , @xmath19 , @xmath1 , etc , into a njl model @xcite .",
    "otherwise , there will be produced a chromo - electric field resulting in the flow of color charges , so a homogeneous and color conducting quark medium with nonzero color charge densities is not allowed to be a stable one @xcite .",
    "( recall , there is no need to add new chemical potentials into qcd .",
    "the point is that in the qcd 2sc ground state a nonzero value of the eightth gluon field component might be generated .",
    "effectively , it is the @xmath1-chemical potential , so color neutrality is fulfilled automatically in the qcd approach @xcite . )    in the present paper , in contrast to our previous investigations @xcite , we study the mesonic and diquark excitations of color neutral quark matter in the framework of a simple two flavor njl model at zero temperature .",
    "we consider both the case of rather small values of the quark chemical potential @xmath0 ( the @xmath20 color symmetric ( normal ) phase ) , and the case of @xmath0-values , corresponding to the 2sc phase of the model .",
    "in addition , the properties of pseudo - scalar diquarks are also included into the consideration .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the thermodynamic potential as well as the effective action of the njl model , extended by an additional color @xmath1-chemical potential term , is obtained in the one quark loop approximation .",
    "further , in section iii , the gap equations and the phase structure of the model is investigated under the color neutrality constraint . here",
    "the values of @xmath1 are obtained at which the 2sc phase is a color neutral one .",
    "then , in the sections iv , v , and vi , the masses of the @xmath4- and @xmath5 mesons , scalar diquarks , and pseudo - scalar diquarks are considered , respectively . finally , in the appendix , the influence of the mixing between @xmath5-meson and scalar diquarks on the @xmath5-mass is discussed .",
    "in the original version of the njl model @xcite the four - fermionic interaction of a proton @xmath21 and neutron @xmath22 doublet was considered , and the principle of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking was demonstrated .",
    "later , the @xmath23-doublet was replaced by a doublet of colored up @xmath24 and down @xmath25 quarks , in order to describe phenomenologically the physics of light mesons @xcite , diquarks @xcite , as well as meson - baryon interactions @xcite . in this sense",
    "the njl model may be thought of as an effective theory for low energy qcd .. by integrating in the generating functional of qcd over gluons and further `` approximating '' the nonperturbative gluon propagator by a @xmath26function , one arrives at an effective local chiral four - quark interaction of the njl type describing low - energy hadron physics .",
    "moreover , by performing a fierz transformation of the interaction terms , it possible to obtain a njl - type lagrangian describing the interaction of quarks in the scalar and pseudo - scalar @xmath27- as well as scalar and pseudo - scalar diquark @xmath28 channels ( see , e.g. , the lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) below ) . ]",
    "( of course , it is necessary to remember that in the njl model , in contrast with qcd , quarks are not confined in the hardronic phase , which is a shortcoming of the model . ) at present time the phenomenon of dynamical ( chiral ) symmetry breaking is one of the cornerstones of modern physics .",
    "so , this effect was studied in the framework of njl - type models under the influence of external magnetic fields @xcite , in curved space - times @xcite , in spaces with nontrivial topology @xcite , etc .",
    "formally , as it was mentioned above , quarks are presented in the mass spectrum of the model .",
    "so it is very suitable for the description of normal hot and/or dense quark matter @xcite in which , as it is known , quarks are not confined .",
    "njl - type models still remain a simple but useful instrument for studying color superconducting quark matter at moderate densities @xcite , where analytical and lattice computations in the framework of qcd are impossible .",
    "we start from the following 2-flavor njl lagrangian , called for the description of interactions in the quark - antiquark , scalar diquark- as well as pseudo - scalar diquark channels at low and moderate energies and baryon densities ( the consideration is performed in minkovski space - time notation ) : @xmath29q+ g\\big\\{(\\bar qq)^2 + ( \\bar qi\\gamma^5\\vec\\tau q)^2\\big\\}+\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\!\\!\\!\\sum_{a=2,5,7}\\big\\{h_s [ \\bar q^ci\\gamma^5\\tau_2\\lambda_{a}q ] [ \\bar qi\\gamma^5\\tau_2\\lambda_{a } q^c ] + h_p [ \\bar q^c\\tau_2\\lambda_{a}q ] [ \\bar q\\tau_2\\lambda_{a } q^c]\\big\\ } ,    \\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the quark chemical potential , the quark field @xmath31 is a flavor doublet and color triplet as well as a four - component dirac spinor , where @xmath32 ( or @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 ( or @xmath35 ) .",
    "@xmath36 , @xmath37 are charge - conjugated spinors , and @xmath38 is the charge conjugation matrix ( symbol @xmath39 denotes the transposition operation ) . it is supposed that up and down quarks have equal current ( bare ) mass @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , we use the notations @xmath41 for pauli matrices , and @xmath42 for antisymmetric gell - mann matrices in flavor and color space , respectively .",
    "clearly , the lagrangian @xmath43 is invariant under transformations from the color @xmath44- as well as baryon @xmath45 groups .",
    "in addition , at @xmath46 this lagrangian is symmetric under the chiral @xmath47 group ( chiral transformations act on the flavor indices of quark fields only ) . moreover , since @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the generator of the third isospin component , @xmath50 is the generator of the electric charge , and @xmath51 is the baryon charge generator , our system is symmetric under the electromagnetic group @xmath52 as well . if the lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) is obtained from the qcd one - gluon exchange approximation , then @xmath53 .",
    "however , in the present consideration we will not fix relations between coupling constants , so they are treated as free parameters .",
    "it is necessary to note also that at @xmath54 the lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) is invariant under the charge conjugation symmetry ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) that is , however , spoiled by the chemical potential term .",
    "furtheron , the temperature is chosen to be zero throughout the paper . in this case",
    "there is a critical value @xmath57 of the chemical potential , such that at @xmath58 the color symmetric ( normal ) phase is realized in the system ( evidently , the ground state of this phase is a color singlet ) .",
    "however , at @xmath59 one obtains a color superconducting ( 2sc ) phase in which @xmath60 is spontaneously broken down to @xmath15 .",
    "only two quark colors , say red and green , participate in the gap formation in the 2sc phase , the blue quarks stay gapless .",
    "so the densities of red / green quarks , @xmath61 , are equal in this phase , however the density @xmath62 of blue quarks is not equal to @xmath61 , i.e. local color neutrality is broken .",
    "thus , @xmath63 . however , the color charge @xmath64 , where @xmath65diag@xmath66 is the matrix in the color space , vanishes in the 2sc phase .",
    "other color charges @xmath13 @xmath67 are also zero in this phase @xcite . ] to restore local color neutrality in the 2sc phase of the model ( [ 1 ] ) , usually an additional chemical potential term @xmath68 is introduced into the considerations @xcite , where @xmath69 , and @xmath70diag@xmath71 is the matrix in the color space .",
    "hence , @xmath72 if @xmath1 is an independent model parameter , then lagrangian ( [ 3 ] ) is symmetric under the color @xmath73 group .",
    "however , if local color neutrality is imposed , then the chemical potential @xmath1 is not an independent parameter .",
    "its value must be chosen in such a way that the ground state expectation value @xmath17 is identically equal to zero . hence , @xmath1 depends on @xmath0 etc .",
    "for example , in the color symmetric phase , i.e. at @xmath74 ( it will be shown in section [ iii ] that in general case @xmath75 @xmath57 ) , where @xmath76 even in the theory ( [ 1 ] ) , we have to put @xmath77",
    ". however @xmath1 has a nontrivial @xmath0-dependence at @xmath78 in order to supply the zero value of @xmath17 .",
    "as a consequence , we see that the color symmetry group of the model ( [ 3 ] ) depends on @xmath0 : at @xmath74 it is @xmath60 , whereas at @xmath78 it is the @xmath73 subgroup of @xmath60 which is just the color symmetry group of the term @xmath68 .    in the present paper we are going to study both the ground state properties of the system with lagrangian @xmath79 , and its mass spectrum in the quark- , meson- and diquark sectors .",
    "so , we have to obtain the thermodynamic potential @xmath80 as well as the effective action of the model up to a second order in the bosonic degrees of freedom .",
    "to begin with , let us introduce the linearized version of lagrangian @xmath79 that contains auxiliary bosonic fields : @xmath81q   -\\frac{1}{4g}\\big [ \\sigma\\sigma+\\pi_a\\pi_a\\big ] -   \\frac1{4h_s}\\delta^{s*}_{a}\\delta^s_{a}-   \\frac1{4h_p}\\delta^{p*}_{a'}\\delta^p_{a'}-   \\nonumber\\\\ & - & \\frac{\\delta^{s*}_{a}}{2}[\\bar q^ci\\gamma^5\\tau_2\\lambda_{a } q ] -\\frac{\\delta^s_{a}}{2}[\\bar q i\\gamma^5\\tau_2\\lambda_{a}q^c ] -\\frac{\\delta^{p*}_{a'}}{2}[\\bar q^c\\tau_2\\lambda_{a ' } q ] -\\frac{\\delta^p_{a'}}{2}[\\bar q\\tau_2\\lambda_{a ' } q^c ] , \\label{8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where as well as in the following the summation over repeated indices @xmath82 and @xmath83 is implied .",
    "lagrangians @xmath79 and @xmath84 are equivalent on the equations of motion for bosonic fields , from which it follows that @xmath85 one can easily see from ( [ 9 ] ) that mesonic fields @xmath86 are real quantities , i.e. @xmath87 ( the superscript symbol @xmath88 denotes the hermitian conjugation ) , but all diquark fields @xmath89 are complex ones , so @xmath90 moreover , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are scalars and pseudo - scalars , correspondingly .",
    "clearly , the real @xmath5 and @xmath93 fields are color singlets , all scalar diquarks @xmath91 form a color antitriplet @xmath94 of the @xmath60 group .",
    "the same is true for pseudo - scalar diquarks @xmath92 which are also the components of an @xmath95-multiplet of the color group .",
    "evidently , in the @xmath44-color symmetric phase ( at @xmath74 ) all diquark fields must have zero ground state expectation values , i.  e. @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "otherwise , we have an indication that the ground state of the system is no more an @xmath60-invariant one .",
    "lagrangian ( [ 8 ] ) provides us with a common footing for obtaining both the thermodynamic potential ( tdp ) and the mass spectrum for bosonic excitations .",
    "indeed , in the one - fermion loop approximation , the effective action for the boson fields is expressed through the path integral over quark fields : @xmath98[dq]\\exp\\bigl(i\\int\\tilde l\\,d^4 x\\bigr),\\ ] ] where @xmath99+\\tilde { \\cal s}_{\\rm { eff } } , \\label{10}\\ ] ] @xmath100 is a normalization constant .",
    "the quark contribution term @xmath101 is here given by : @xmath102[dq]\\exp\\bigl(\\frac{i}{2}\\int\\big [ \\bar qd^+q+\\bar q^cd^-q^c-\\bar qk q^c-\\bar q^ck^{*}q\\big ] d^4 x\\bigr ) .",

    "starting from ( [ 10])-([14 ] ) , it is possible to define the thermodynamic potential @xmath116 of the model : @xmath117 where , in the spirit of the mean - field approximation , all boson fields are supposed to be @xmath115-independent .",
    "it is well - known that ground state expectation values @xmath118 are coordinates of the global minimum point of the thermodynamic potential @xmath80 , i.e. they form a solution of the gap equations ( evidently , in our approach all ground state expectation values do not depend on coordinates @xmath115 ) : @xmath119",
    "let us for a moment assume that in ( [ 3 ] ) the chemical potential @xmath1 is an independent parameter ( @xmath137 ) . then",
    ", lagrangian @xmath79 is invariant under the color @xmath138 symmetry group .",
    "recall , that the phase structure of any theory is defined by a competition of its order parameters . in our case , the order parameters ( ground state expectation values ) , @xmath139 , are obtained from a solution of the gap equations ( see the previous section ) .",
    "since the consideration of the model ( [ 3 ] ) with a total set of order parameters is a very hard task , we shall assume that parity is conserved , i.e. @xmath140 ( in the section [ via ] some arguments are presented , however , that at sufficiently high values of pseudo - scalar coupling @xmath141 parity might be spontaneously broken down ) , thus having to deal only with @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "in this case three different phases might exist in the model ( [ 3 ] ) : * i ) * in the first one , the normal phase , @xmath144 for all @xmath145 . in this phase",
    "the initial color symmetry remains intact . *",
    "ii ) * the second one is a well - known 2sc phase with @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "the ground state of this phase is invariant under @xmath15-color symmetry . *",
    "iii ) * finally , there might exist a phase with @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 .",
    "( note , the two phases * ii ) * and * iii ) * are not unitarily equivalent , since there are no color transformations from @xmath138 that connects the corresponding ground state expectation values . ) however , since color neutrality can not be achieved in the ground state of the form * iii ) * ( see @xcite ) , throughout of our paper only two order parameters , @xmath142 and @xmath151 , will be taken into account whereas other ones will be supposed to have zero expectation values , i.e. @xmath152 , @xmath153 .",
    "so , below only the competition between the normal phase ( @xmath154 ) and the 2sc one ( @xmath155 ) will be considered . as a result ,",
    "one may deal with a thermodynamic potential @xmath80 which depends on two variables @xmath156 or , equivalently , @xmath157 , only .",
    "then , the expression for the thermodynamic potential @xmath80 can be calculated with the help of ( [ 19 ] ) ( see also , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath158 where @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 .",
    "since the integrals in the right hand side of ( [ 32 ] ) are ultraviolet divergent , we regularize them and the other divergent integrals below by implementing a three - dimensional cutoff @xmath165 .",
    "the resulting gap equations look like : @xmath166 in ( [ 33 ] ) , ( [ 34 ] ) as well as in other expressions , containing four - dimensional momentum integrals , @xmath167 is shorthand for @xmath168 , where @xmath169 .",
    "this prescription correctly implements the roles of @xmath0 , @xmath1 as chemical potentials and preserves the causality of the theory ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "now , let us impose the local color neutrality requirement on the ground state of the model .",
    "it means that the quantity @xmath1 takes such values that the density of the 8-color charge @xmath170 equals zero for arbitrary fixed values of other model parameters .",
    "so , we have the following local color neutrality constraint : @xmath171 the system of eqs .",
    "( [ 33])-([35 ] ) has two different solutions .",
    "as we have already discussed after ( [ 3 ] ) , the first one ( with @xmath172 , @xmath173 ) corresponds to the @xmath174-symmetric phase of the model ( normal phase ) , the second one ( with @xmath155 and @xmath175 ) to the 2sc phase . as usual ,",
    "solutions of these equations give local extrema of the thermodynamic potential @xmath176 ( [ 32 ] ) , so one should also check which of them corresponds to the absolute minimum of @xmath80 .",
    "having found the solution corresponding to the stable state of quark matter ( the absolute minimum of @xmath80 ) , we obtained the behavior of the gaps @xmath177 , @xmath178 as well as the @xmath1 vs. the quark chemical potential @xmath0 ( see figs  1,2 ) .",
    "( note , in all numerical calculations of the paper we use the parameter set @xmath179 that leads in the framework of the njl model to the well - known vacuum phenomenological values of the pion weak - decay constant @xmath180  mev , pion mass @xmath181  mev , and chiral quark condensate @xmath182 .",
    "the relation between @xmath183 and @xmath184 in ( [ 350 ] ) is induced , e.g. , by the structure of qcd four - quark vertices in the one - gluon exchange approximation . )",
    "the region @xmath185  mev is the domain of @xmath60-color symmetric quark matter because @xmath80 in this case is minimized by @xmath186 and @xmath154 , @xmath173 . for @xmath187 , the solution with @xmath186 , @xmath155 and @xmath175",
    ", corresponding to the 2sc phase , gives the global minimum of @xmath80 , and thereby the color superconducting phase is favored .",
    "the transition between these two phases is of the first - order , which is characterized by a discontinuity in the behavior of @xmath177 and @xmath178 vs. @xmath0 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "finally , remark that the critical value @xmath57 of the quark chemical potential was calculated in the framework of the model ( [ 1 ] ) as well . in terms of the parameter set ( [ 350 ] ) we have @xmath188  mev @xcite , i.e. in the color neutral quark matter the transition to the 2sc phase occurred at slightly less values of the quark chemical potentials .    similarly to @xcite , it is possible to find the following expressions for the matrix elements @xmath136 of the quark propagator matrix @xmath128 : @xmath189 where @xmath190 , and @xmath191 , @xmath192 are the projectors on the red / green and blue directions in the color space , correspondingly .",
    "the poles of the matrix elements ( [ 28])-([31 ] ) of the quark propagator give the dispersion laws , i.e. the momentum dependence of energy , for quarks in a medium .",
    "thus , we have @xmath193 for the energy of red / green quarks and @xmath194 for the energy of red / green antiquarks . moreover , the energy of blue quarks ( antiquarks ) is equal to @xmath195 ( @xmath196 ) .",
    "it is clear from figs 1,2 that in the 2sc phase , i.e. at @xmath78 , we have @xmath197 , @xmath198 .",
    "then , in this phase the quantity @xmath199 can reach both the value @xmath200 ( the fermi energy for red / green quarks ) and the value @xmath201 ( the fermi energy for blue quarks ) . in this case , in order to create a red / green quark in the 2sc phase , a minimal amount of energy ( the gap ) equal to @xmath202 at the fermi level ( @xmath203 ) is required .",
    "similarly , there is no energy cost to create a blue quark at its fermi level @xmath204 , i.e. blue quarks are gapless in the 2sc phase . in the normal phase of the model , i.e. at @xmath74 , the minimal energy @xmath205 is needed for the creation of a quark of any color . note ,",
    "both in the 2sc and normal phases of the model the minimal energy required for a quark creation differs from the minimal energy required for the creation of an antiquark of the same color .",
    "this fact reflects the breaking of charge conjugation symmetry in the presence of chemical potentials .    without loss of generality",
    ", we will assume throughout the paper that @xmath178 is a real nonnegative quantity .",
    "given the explicit expression for the quark propagator @xmath128 , in the next sections we will calculate two - point ( unnormalized ) correlators of meson and diquark fluctuations over the ground state in the one - loop ( mean - field ) approximation and find their masses .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath206 -part ( [ 2.24 ] ) of the effective action is composed from @xmath207 , @xmath208 and @xmath209 fields only .",
    "so it provides us with nondiagonal matrix elements @xmath210 ( @xmath211 ) of the inverse propagator matrix of @xmath5 , @xmath212 , and @xmath213 .",
    "moreover , each term in @xmath206 is proportional to @xmath178 or @xmath214 as well as to the constituent quark mass @xmath177 ( see appendix ) .",
    "hence , in the color symmetric phase ( @xmath154 ) there is no mixing between @xmath5-meson and diquark @xmath215 at all .",
    "the parameter @xmath177 is small ( or even equals zero if @xmath46 ) in the 2sc phase , so we ignore for simplicity the @xmath5-@xmath215 mixing effect in this phase , too . as a result , in order to get the masses of mesons we use only the effective action ( [ 2.22 ] ) which has the form @xmath216 , where @xmath217 in these formulae @xmath218 is the inverse propagator of @xmath5-mesons , and @xmath219 is the ( diagonal ) matrix of the inverse @xmath4-meson propagator . evidently , that @xmath220 next , using in ( [ 40])-([41 ] ) the expressions ( [ 28])-([31 ] ) for the matrix elements @xmath136 , it is possible to obtain with the help of relations ( [ 44 ] ) the functions @xmath218 , @xmath219 , and then their momentum space representations , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , correspondingly .",
    "the zeros of these functions determine the particle and antiparticle dispersion laws , i.e. the relations between their energy and three - momenta . in the present paper , we are mainly interested in the investigation of the modification of meson and diquark masses in dense and cold color neutral quark matter . in this case , the particle mass is defined as the value of its energy in the rest frame , @xmath223 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , where the calculation of inverse propagators for @xmath5- and @xmath4-mesons is significantly simplified . indeed ,",
    "in the rest frame it is possible to get : @xmath224 @xmath225 @xmath226 } + \\frac{1}{e_\\delta^-[p_0 ^ 2 - 4(e_\\delta^-)^2]}\\right\\ } , \\label{221}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the same notations as in ( [ 32 ] ) were used .",
    "the zeros of the functions ( [ 20 ] ) , ( [ 22 ] ) give us the masses of @xmath4- and @xmath5-mesons , respectively ( see fig .",
    "the term @xmath227 proportional to @xmath228 , since it is comparable ( or even less ) in magnitude with nondiagonal elements @xmath229 ( @xmath211 ) of the full inverse propagator matrix of @xmath5 , @xmath212 , and @xmath213 ( see appendix ) , which are not taken into account in the above consideration . ]",
    "we see that in the 2sc phase the masses of the sigma- and pi - meson are about 300 mev .",
    "moreover , the pion is a stable particle in this phase ( only electroweak decay channels are allowed ) .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the following arguments .",
    "it is clear that the first and the second integrals in ( [ 20 ] ) are analytical functions in the whole complex @xmath230 plane , except the cuts @xmath231 and @xmath232 , respectively ( here @xmath233 is the minimum of the expression @xmath234 , which is taken at the point @xmath235 ) .",
    "evidently , @xmath236 corresponds to the threshold for the pion decay into a red - green quark - antiquark pair , whereas @xmath237 corresponds to the threshold for the pion decay into a blue quark - antiquark pair .",
    "it is easily seen from fig .",
    "3 that in the 2sc phase the pion mass is less than the values of these two thresholds . because there are no other singularities in ( [ 20 ] ) corresponding to different channels of the pion decay , we can conclude that in the 2sc phase the pion is a stable particle .",
    "the neglection of the mixing between the @xmath5-meson and @xmath213-scalar diquark also results in a stable @xmath5-meson .",

    "it follows from our investigation that stable quark pair formation occurs in the scalar channel at a weaker coupling strength than in the pseudo - scalar one .",
    "indeed , if the parameter set of the model is fixed by the relations ( [ 350 ] ) , then in the normal phase scalar diquarks are stable particles ( with masses about 700 mev at @xmath422 ) , since in this case @xmath435 ( see ( [ gamma4 ] ) ) .",

    "then at @xmath441 the normal phase is a stable one , but at @xmath442 a tachyonic instability appears , so the normal phase is destroyed ( see the section [ vb ] ) .",

    "in section [ iv ] the numerical values for the @xmath5-meson mass @xmath448 was obtained in the assumption that the mixing of @xmath5 with @xmath428 is absent . moreover ,",
    "we have shown in this approach that the @xmath5-meson is a stable particle in the 2sc phase .",
    "now let us prove that a deeper investigation of the @xmath5-meson mass , based on the inclusion of the mixing between @xmath5 and @xmath428 , results in the conclusion that in the 2sc phase @xmath5 is a resonance , having a small decay width into a quark pair .    indeed , starting from the total number of effective actions ( [ 2.24 ] ) , ( [ 40 ] ) , and ( [ 3.38 ] ) it is possible to find the 3@xmath4493 inverse propagator matrix @xmath450 of @xmath5- , @xmath428- , and @xmath451 fields . in the center of mass frame of the momentum space representation ( @xmath223 ) it has the following form in the 2sc phase : @xmath452{lll } \\gamma(p_0)~ , & \\gamma_{\\sigma\\delta^s_2}(p_0 ) , & \\gamma_{\\sigma\\delta^{s*}_2}(p_0)\\\\ \\gamma_{\\delta^s_2\\sigma}(p_0 ) , & \\gamma_{\\delta^s_2\\delta^s_2}^{2s}(p_0 ) , & \\gamma_{\\delta^s_2\\delta^{s*}_2}^{2s}(p_0)\\\\ \\gamma_{\\delta^{s*}_2\\sigma}(p_0 ) , & \\gamma_{\\delta^{s*}_2\\delta^s_2}^{2s}(p_0 ) , & \\gamma_{\\delta^{s*}_2\\delta^{s*}_2}^{2s}(p_0)\\end{array}\\right ) , \\label{2100}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath453 } + \\frac{2e^--p_0}{ee_\\delta^-[4(e_\\delta^-)^2-p_0 ^ 2]}\\right\\}. \\label{230}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] other matrix elements from ( [ 2100 ] ) are presented in ( [ 22 ] ) and ( [ 24 ] ) .",
    "note that the matrix elements ( [ 230 ] ) , mixing @xmath5 with @xmath428 and @xmath451 , are proportional to the dynamical quark mass @xmath177 .",
    "so , in the 2sc phase both @xmath177 and these matrix elements may be considered as small quantities ( see fig .",
    "the mass spectrum is defined by the equation @xmath454 , which has a rather complicated form ( note , @xmath455 is an even function vs @xmath365 , i.e. it depends on @xmath230 ) : @xmath456 where @xmath457 and the functions @xmath458 , @xmath459 are defined in ( [ 220 ] ) , ( [ 221 ] ) . in the @xmath230-plane the equation ( [ 210 ] )",
    "has three solutions .",
    "one of them corresponds to a nambu - goldstone boson , @xmath300 .",
    "the other two we denote as @xmath460 and @xmath461 . since @xmath177 is a small quantity , the right hand side ( rhs ) of ( [ 210 ] ) can be considered as a small perturbation .",
    "then the solution @xmath461 ( as well as @xmath460 ) can be constructed in the framework of a perturbative expansion , based on the smallness of the rhs of ( [ 210 ] ) . in the zeroth order we have @xmath462 , so @xmath463 , where @xmath448 is the zero of the function @xmath464 and is graphically represented in fig .",
    "one can easily obtain the first perturbative correction @xmath465 and so on .",
    "now let us put our attention on the fact that @xmath466 and @xmath467 are analytical functions in the whole complex @xmath230-plane except the cut , composed from all real points such that @xmath468 .",
    "( in the rest of the real @xmath230-axis @xmath466 and @xmath467 take real values . ) through the cut these functions can be analytically continued to the second riemann sheet . in our case",
    "@xmath469 mev and @xmath470 mev , so @xmath471 , i.e. it lies on the cut . hence , both @xmath472 and @xmath472 have imaginary parts , and the solution ( [ 290 ] ) lies in the second riemann sheet .",
    "it means that @xmath461 corresponds to a resonance in the mass spectrum .",
    "numerical estimates show that the width of this resonance is a rather small quantity , less than 30 mev .",
