    "the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of slow neutron captures in agb stars on isotopes of the fe group  elements .",
    "in particular ti , cr , fe , ni , and zn are considered to be members of the iron group .",
    "these nuclei are predominantly the product of supernovae ( sne ) , both core collapse and sneia ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it has been known for over three decades that small ( @xmath9 1% ) variations are found in the isotopic compositions of ti , cr , fe , ni , and zn in macroscopic samples of meteorites : see e.g. @xcite and the review by @xcite . in particular , these isotopic effects are common in calcium - aluminum - rich inclusions ( hereafter cais ) in meteorites , but are also wide spread at lower levels in bulk  samples of different groups of meteorites .",
    "the observed effects in cr , fe , and ni typically show enrichments in the heaviest isotopes @xmath0cr , @xmath1fe , and @xmath2ni , which are a small fraction of the abundance of the respective element ( @xmath10 2.3% for @xmath0cr , @xmath10 0.28% for @xmath1fe , @xmath10 0.9% for @xmath2ni ) .",
    "in addition , the isotopic patterns observed in ti , ca , and si are distinct and complex . only one datum exists for zn . as the fe group elements are associated with supernovae ( sne ) , it has been natural that interpretations of these effects in cais and bulk  meteorites have focused on nucleosynthetic processes in them .",
    "this has not often led to any firm explanation of the observed isotopic anomalies or to clear predictions .",
    "the first study that considered the possibility of @xmath11-process effects on fe - group nuclei was by @xcite , who explored the occurrence of @xmath11-processing in massive stars after revisions in the rate for the @xmath12ne(@xmath13,n)@xmath14 mg reaction and provided some possible insights .",
    "the @xmath11-processed material is , in the interstellar medium ( hereafter ism ) , predominantly from low mass agb stars .",
    "we expect that the effect of @xmath11-processing on cr , fe , and ni ( originally synthesized in sne ) is to produce the heavier isotopes of these elements , @xmath0cr , @xmath1fe , and @xmath2ni , in over - abundance ; this can be seen by considering that the pure @xmath11-process abundance pattern is , in general , smoothly correlated with the neutron - capture cross sections , yielding processed material enriched in nuclides heavier than the seed nuclei . as only a very small fraction of matter in the star",
    "is subjected to @xmath11-processing , it is not obvious just how large the consequences will be in the envelope of an agb star , or will be provided to the ism .",
    "there are thus three distinct issues : i ) what are the @xmath11-process effects on isotopic abundance patterns in cr , fe , and ni in an agb envelope ?",
    "ii ) how significant are these effects ?",
    "iii ) what are the effects to be expected on the nuclei of lower atomic number than iron ( e.g. ti , si , and ca ) ?    we will show that there are substantial consequences on the abundances of @xmath0cr , @xmath1fe , and @xmath2ni produced in agb stars and that these may provide an explanation of the effects observed in many macroscopic meteorite samples .",
    "we will try to relate this to data in presolar dust grains .",
    "the shifts found in other fe - group nuclei subject to the @xmath11-process will be shown to be more complex .    in the different classes of data that are available",
    "we must consider both presolar grains , each of which come from a particular stellar source , and macroscopic samples of solar system material , that come from blends from different stellar sources .",
    "the macroscopic samples of very early solar system matter derive from mixing , heating , melting from various precursor materials and exhibit relatively small isotopic shifts ( @xmath15 1% ) .",
    "they are blends of very local parcels from unknown sources , but mixed so that they are rather close to the average isotopic admixture .",
    "in contrast to such macroscopic samples , grains formed as circumstellar condensates ( subsequently called circons ) and found in meteorites may exhibit very large ( @xmath16 50% or more ) isotopic abundance shifts ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for an in - depth review ) .",
    "we will try to relate the results on cr , fe , and ni to data on presolar dust grains .",
    "a circon is the direct product of stellar nucleosynthesis in a single star .",
    "the initial material from the ism that is incorporated in a forming star may be variable , but mixing provides an initially homogeneous isotopic pattern in that star , which is subject to processing in the subsequent stellar evolution before the formation of a grain .",
    "the effects produced will depend on the particular stage in the evolution and on the initial isotopic composition of the star .",
    "results on circons often serve as clues to still unrecognized stellar processes .",
    "there are often difficulties in explaining nucleosynthesis effects in a circumstellar dust particle from a single star resulting from incomplete knowledge of many nuclear and dynamical processes .",
    "for an individual circon grain , the isotopic composition then depends on the initial abundances ( not known ) of the associated star and on the details of the subsequent stellar evolution which we claim to understand . for stellar sources that have , at each time , a well mixed envelope , the problem is simplified . in this study",
    ", we will focus on those circons that are inferred to come from agb stars and not sne . for sne sources , it is possible to find different production zones in the models , with different yields , and presume that these can be sampled ad - hoc to produce the isotopic pattern and the carbon compounds observed .",
    "grains that are plausibly attributed to sne sources are not considered here .",
    "the problem of forming c - rich phases in standard sne sources with a high o / c ratio is not really addressed .",
    "the case of agb stars is much more restricted , as their envelopes are well mixed .    as there must be a spread in the isotopic abundances in the ism ( both in time and space )",
    ", different star formation sites will have some variability in their bulk  isotopic patterns .",
    "thus , even if we know the exact evolution of an agb star in terms of its mass and metallicity , it is not possible to infer the resulting isotopic shifts .",
    "however , the isotopic data on circons give good insight into the nature of the nuclear effects and , often , a rather clear identification of the possible stellar site .",
    "we will therefore use some of the data on such circumstellar condensates that are associated with agb stars in conjunction with processed solar system samples to explore the implications of @xmath11-processing models of fe group elements .",
    "this requires an interplay of data from solar system processed material and the data on circons .",
    "we will also use this approach to infer aspects of the isotopic variability in the different samples of ism which the circons represent and to explore the general isotopic anomalies found in solar - system processed material .",
    "in particular , it will be shown that the ti data on circons demonstrate that they show the results of neutron captures and that the complex patterns observed are simply a reflection of agb processing on material with some small , but substantial variability in isotopic abundances in the original stellar sources .",
    "the questions of @xmath11-processing of si and ca and of variability within the ism will also be discussed .    unlike circumstellar condensates ,",
    "the solar system was formed out of a complex assembly of stellar debris , from a wide variety of sources , operative at greatly different times , which were not completely mixed . while there is clear isotopic evidence for the contributions from certain precursor sources to individual macroscopic objects processed in the solar system , it is not possible to explain the observed isotopic variability in macroscopic samples by a single mechanism or a single star .",
    "what we observe are changes in the isotopic composition of an element relative to some terrestrial standard .",
    "this means that large isotopic shifts may be more easily interpretable than very small effects .",
    "the isotopic ratios of the bulk  solar system is , of course , not exactly known .",
    "positive variations in isotopic abundances may be easily interpreted as additions  of an isotope to the solar reservoir ; but the presence of negative variations clearly show that we are dealing with isotopic admixtures that may be different for many isotopes , as has been well recognized .    we first present results for cr , fe , and ni for agb sources that have initial isotopic abundances which are solar",
    ". then , we will explore the characteristics of @xmath11-processing when the source is not solar and show that there are simple rules which permit one to estimate relative isotopic shifts for an element independent of the mass or metallicity of the particular agb star .",
    "this leads to a general rule for stars which do not have an initial inventory with solar isotopic abundances .",
    "the discussion will extend to the broader issue of whether the observational evidence supports processing in low mass agb stars .",
    "the @xmath11-processing in agb stars takes place on a small parcel of matter that is removed from the stellar envelope and is exposed to neutrons . this processed material",
    "is then mixed back into the mass of the envelope present at that event @xcite .",
    "as the envelope looses mass , the dilution of the processed material continuously changes during the thermally - pulsing ( tp ) phase associated with the @xmath11-process .",
    "also the seed nuclei of the star are to some extent altered by the processing required to produce the bulk of the @xmath11-nuclei . to produce the solar  @xmath11-inventory requires @xmath10 10@xmath17 of all the seeds to be consumed",
    ". this will result in a small , but significant depletion of the seed nuclei in the composition of the envelope .",
    "the isotopic shifts in the envelope will be small for each cycle of @xmath11-processing , but they will increase in time as the envelope is greatly reduced in mass . while usual discussions of the @xmath11-process refer to the fe group elements as the seeds ,",
    "in fact there is also a major involvement of lower mass species , particularly if one considers elements like ca , ti , and si , whose final concentration is due both to their initial inventory and to the modifications induced by neutron captures on lighter , abundant elements .",
    "the calculations presented here assumed that the initial inventory of all heavy elements was solar , with the solar isotopic ratios taken from @xcite , but with the abundances of heavy elements  relative to h and he variable as an estimate of the net metallicity of the system ( see e.g. the same procedure adopted in * ? ? ?",
    "the net number of isotopes ( @xmath18 ) in the envelope for all species is calculated at the end of each pulse - interpulse episode .",
    "this includes the @xmath11-processed material just produced and dredged up and the material already present in the envelope from previous episodes and not lost .",
    "calculations were carried out through the full evolution of model agb stars , including all stages in which any significant neutron fluence occurs .",
    "these were done up to the end of the agb phase .",
    "the operation of the main neutron source @xmath19c(@xmath13,n)@xmath20o was followed taking the size of the @xmath19c reservoir ( or _ pocket _ ) from @xcite .",
    "a second burst of neutrons occurs from the @xmath12ne(@xmath13,n)@xmath14 mg reaction in the thermal pulses ; its relevance varies with the model , as the rate of neutron production is sensitive to temperature .",
    "we report on stars ranging in mass from 1.5 to 3@xmath3 .",
    "the 3@xmath3  case always evolves to an envelope with c / o @xmath16 1 , while the 1.5@xmath3  case becomes c - rich only at relatively low metallicity or after very advanced dredge - up stages . in the 3@xmath3  case ,",
    "the neutrons from the @xmath12ne source are important and produced at a rather high neutron density , while in the lower mass models the @xmath19c source always dominates .",
    "the @xmath19c pocket used by @xcite was formed adopting an exponential profile for the proton penetration down to @xmath21 @xmath3  ( depth in mass ) . in this treatment",
    "most of the available @xmath19c  is within about @xmath22 @xmath3 , which produces the galactic enrichment of @xmath11-elements described in @xcite .",
    "the reactions considered in the region of fe - peak nuclei are shown in figure [ network ] , where we also give approximate 30kev maxwellian - averaged values for cross sections ( in mb , kadonis database * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and laboratory half - lives of crucial nuclei of interest @xcite . in the detailed calculations used ,",
    "cross sections variations are considerable , and generally more complex than a simple @xmath23 scaling ; also decay rates may change .",
    "the mass loss rates were taken from the new picture of low mass star winds deriving from the recent works by @xcite and @xcite , where the model agb luminosities could be reconciled with observations .",
    "cases for different metallicities @xmath24 were studied ; here the notations used are @xmath25 for a total metallicity of @xmath24 = 0.0154 @xcite ; and @xmath26 . at low [ fe / h ] values ,",
    "all heavy elements are scaled downward in same way as iron .",
    "the nucleosynthesis code was that used by @xcite ; however , the calculations presented here are somewhat different from those reported in @xcite as they now include explicitly @xmath4cr ( the full computer output is available from the authors on request ) .    for each element",
    ", we have chosen an index nucleus ( @xmath27 ) which is of high abundance and critical to any flow induced by n captures in producing isotopes of higher mass of that element . for chromium ,",
    "iron and nickel the index isotopes were @xmath28cr , @xmath29fe , and @xmath1ni .",
    "note that some isotopes are bypassed or purely destroyed in the neutron capture chain ( e.g. @xmath0fe and @xmath4cr ) .",
    "the production of @xmath2ni depends on the complex branch at @xmath2cu .",
    "the general reaction network is shown in figure [ network ] .",
    "the enrichment factors ( @xmath30 ) in isotopic abundances for cr , fe , and ni were calculated for the envelopes of 1.5 and 3 @xmath3  model stars for @xmath31 and @xmath32 after a different number of pulses ; they are shown in figure [ over1 ] and figure [ over2 ] .",
    "these calculations are for solar initial isotopic abundances .",
    "we define the plotted enrichment factor in the envelope at some particular stage ( @xmath33 ) , for the ratio of the number of nuclides _",
    "i _ to that of the index nuclei @xmath27 , relative to the assumed initial state ( @xmath34 ) in the star , as : @xmath35 we have also included in figures [ over1 ] and [ over2 ] the results taken from the calculations by @xcite . in the report by @xcite",
    "the focus was on the relative yield of heavy to light @xmath11-process nuclei .",
    "however , the on - line data ( available from the fruity site at : http://fruity.oa-teramo.inaf.it/ ) represent a full enough calculation of important nuclei in the region of interest @xcite .",
    "they can thus be applied to the problem of cr , fe , and ni .",
    "it is evident that both models produced marked excess of @xmath0cr , @xmath1fe , and @xmath2ni .",
    "this general inference thus appears well established .",
    "there are clear differences found between our models and fruity data as can be seen by careful inspection of figure [ over1 ] and [ over2 ] .",
    "we note that the enrichments of @xmath0cr and @xmath1fe are much lower than that found in the fruity data for a 1.5@xmath3  source .",
    "there is larger production of @xmath36ni in the fruity models in the normalized ratios shown in figures [ over1 ] and [ over2 ] , but the major excesses are always at @xmath2ni .",
    "these issues will be noted in the text . for reasons of self consistency",
    ", the general discussion and conclusions presented here will use the results following @xcite who present higher neutron fluences and slightly higher temperatures than in the fruity models .",
    "we believe that the specific issues with these agb models will require further detailed investigation .",
    "the differences found between our models and the fruity data are predominantly due to the different size of the @xmath19c - pocket used in the calculations ( our pocket is about four times larger than for fruity ) , to the different solar metallicity assumed and to the non - linear effects induced by them .",
    "inspection of figures [ over1 ] and [ over2 ] shows in any case that the results are generally in agreement and there is no qualitative conflict between these independent works . in particular only the fruity data set and our results specifically treat the production of @xmath0cr , @xmath1fe , and @xmath2ni , including the effects from the presence of @xmath4cr and of @xmath0fe , which are not relevant for computing the production of much heavier @xmath11-nuclei .",
    "we note that all other calculations available in the literature and on - line either do not have envelope abundances for cr , fe , and ni , or are not adequate to permit inferences about yields in this atomic mass region .",
    "we also notice that a full and detailed comparison with fruity is difficult to make , due to different assumptions . as an example , if we look at ti isotopes , fruity outputs give a low production for @xmath37ti and enhancements for @xmath38ti and @xmath4ti at high levels ( see figure [ tifr ] ) .",
    "this is strange , considering the small pocket used in the code .",
    "however , fruity adopted a total solar metallicity of @xmath39 = 0.014 , as in @xcite , against @xmath39 = 0.0154 , adopted by us and by @xcite .",
    "this represents a 10% shift in the solar @xmath24 .",
    "it is possible that these small differences in the inputs cause significant variations in the outputs .",
    "this remains to be clarified .",
    "we consider that the results presented here are a reasonable effort at exploring effects of @xmath11-processing on the cr , fe , and ni isotopes .",
    "it can be seen that the enrichment patterns all show clear enhancements in @xmath0cr , @xmath1fe , and @xmath2ni and very small effects for the other cr , fe , and ni isotopes . for later pulses the @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42",
    "are quite large .",
    "it follows that agb processing will produce significant shifts in the isotopic abundances of these three elements which resemble some of the observed patterns .",
    "the magnitude of the enrichment factors is dependent on the size of the @xmath19c - pocket , the stellar mass and the stage of evolution of the star",
    ". therefore the pattern will only be approximately fixed .",
    "a more detailed discussion for several fe group elements will be given later .",
    "to gain some insight into the possible isotopic abundance patterns resulting from the updated neutron capture scenario outlined above , we first assume , for simplicity , that the composition of the envelope in a star was initially solar , and that it evolves with the addition of pure @xmath11-process material .",
    "the result for the envelope is simply the sum of what was brought up from the neutron capture zones ( @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) plus the initial inventory ( @xmath45 or @xmath46 ) .",
    "we then have : @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the fraction of the original abundance of the isotope @xmath27 remaining in the material processed by a pulse .",
    "the fractional shift of the isotopic ratios of the mixture relative to the initial state ( _ solar _ , or @xmath34 ) is thus : @xmath50 \\eqno ( 4)\\ ] ] and for two pairs of isotopes : @xmath51 / \\left[\\left(\\frac{n_j}{n_k}\\right)/\\left(\\frac{n_j^{\\odot}}{n_k^{\\odot}}\\right)-1\\right ] \\eqno(5)\\ ] ] if @xmath52 is fixed , this implies that the ratio of the enrichment factors for two isotopes is constant if production ratios are constant through all stages of a stellar evolution . note that @xmath49 is not the same for different elements .",
    "inspection of equation ( 4 ) shows that the enrichment of a parcel of matter , once diluted with some original envelope material , will have an isotopic pattern that is essentially fixed and independent of the amount of diluting material , while the magnitude of the isotopic shifts will depend on @xmath49 , the fraction of the diluting material .",
    "the critical parameter determining the pattern can be indicated as @xmath53 , where : @xmath54 \\eqno(6)\\ ] ] is the enrichment factor in the processed parcel .",
    "insofar as @xmath53 is constant for all pulses , then this gives the _ isotopic abundance pattern produced by pure @xmath11-processing_. the magnitude of the isotopic shifts in the envelope for a mixture can then be obtained as : @xmath55 to estimate @xmath53 we have taken , from our calculations , the outputs for the isotopic abundances in a parcel of matter that was removed from the envelope , subject to neutron exposures , following the procedure described previously , but prior to mixing back into the envelope .",
    "this corresponds to exploring the situation in the he - rich layers after a pulse ( we arbitrarily chose the last pulse for a 1.5@xmath3  star with solar metallicity ) .    the curves for @xmath53 for the single @xmath11-processed parcel , _ assuming a solar initial composition _",
    ", are shown in figure [ q_values ] and table [ tab1 ] . in the figure",
    "we also show the @xmath56 values for a smaller @xmath19c pocket from the calculations of @xcite ( case a ) for comparison .",
    "the extension of this small pocket is @xmath57@xmath3  and it contains @xmath58@xmath3  of @xmath19c .",
    ".[tab1]summary of the @xmath59 values for a star of 1.5@xmath3  and solar metallicity , as shown by blue - open circles in figure [ q_values ] .",
    "ca , ti , cr , fe , ni , and zn abundances are calculated using the @xmath19c pocket described in @xcite [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "it is important to note that , while excesses in an isotopic ratio relative to the solar ratio may be explained by addition of that isotope to a solar mix , negative values require that something is being added having an isotopic abundance pattern for several isotopes which is quite distinct from the solar pattern .",
    "this is a well known fact that is often ignored . for all ion - probe data on circons where the isotopic shifts are large ( many hundreds per mil )",
    ", we believe that all the data processing that has been applied is to correct for instrumental discrimination effects , by using the isotopic ratios of an isotope @xmath60 relative to some index isotope @xmath27 through the determination of that ratio in a terrestrial standard for all isotope pairs .",
    "this correction is then applied to the measurements of all data .",
    "in contrast , the data on cais , which are far more precise ( @xmath61 units ) , are most often normalized to a pair of isotopes to correct for instrumental fractionation .",
    "this procedure effectively requires one pair of isotopes to have the terrestrial ratio and thus affects the pattern in all the other ratios . this difference in the treatment of the experimental data",
    "must be kept in mind .",
    "[ [ cr ] ] cr ~~    the discovery of isotopic anomalies in cr by @xcite and @xcite established the presence of small @xmath0cr/@xmath28cr excesses ( of the order of @xmath62 , or 6 @xmath61 units ) in cais from the allende meteorite .",
    "@xcite then measured cr in the two fractionation and unknown nuclear anomalies  ( the so - called fun ) inclusions , ( ek1 - 4 - 1 and c-1 ) that had previously been discovered to have very large isotopic anomalies in many elements .",

    "again , there are no ni isotopic data on circons , other than the results reported by @xcite , which , as indicated above , are not adequate for the problem under discussion .",
    "[ [ ti ] ] ti ~~    there are abundant isotopic data on ti , for solar - system processed samples ( cais and many bulk meteorites ) .",
    "the patterns are complex and varied",
    ". many publications on ti isotopes in processed solar system material are available , but the results we mention below are typical of the whole range observed . it is often found that there are well defined excesses at @xmath38ti , @xmath37ti , and @xmath4ti , with the @xmath4ti anomalies being larger than for @xmath38ti ( as found in ek-1 - 4 - 1 ) .",
    "there are also samples with distinct , large deficits in @xmath4ti and smaller , but clear , deficits in @xmath38ti ( c-1 ) : ( see * ? ? ? * with a normalization to solar @xmath6t1/@xmath77ti ) .",
    "absolute isotopic ratios were obtained using a modified technique that eliminates the normalization for instrumental fractionation @xcite .",
    "these workers showed that at least three , and possibly four stellar sources must have contributed to the five ti isotopes to make up the samples of processed materials .",
    "an extensive discussion of possible stellar sites and sources was also presented by them in trying to identify the compositions of the exotic components .",
    "it is evident that the processed solar materials do not yield a direct tie in with individual possible stellar sources .    because of the problem of complex mixed sources , we turn to the ti data in circons , with the hope of finding some regularity using known nucleosynthetic signatures of agb stars .",
    "the agb processing for a single grain then depends on the stellar evolution and the initial composition of the parent star .",
    "in particular , the variations observed in ti isotopes found in oxygen - rich circons @xcite suggested that the ti isotopic compositions follows the pattern generated by agb processing , following on the calculations by gallino and co - workers .",
    "@xcite presented an extensive study of al , ca , and ti in circons .",
    "they showed very strong evidence that most of these grains were formed in red giant and agb parent stars .",
    "they reported ti data on three oxide grains that showed small isotopic effects , but with divergent patterns .",
    "these grains must have been produced in a regime where c / o@xmath151 , implying a low mass star prior to c enhancement .",
    "extensive studies of the isotopic composition of many elements in sic circumstellar condensates @xcite were presented by several workers ; see e.g. @xcite ; in particular , see their figure 5 .",
    "see also @xcite , in particular see their figure 4 .",
    "the data exhibit a wide and diverse array of very different patterns ; these last have often been described as being v - shaped , but with large variations , sometimes negative .",
    "we will rather use a j  shape as a descriptor , because that is the pattern which would be produced in agbs from an initially solar mix ( see figure [ ti-1 ] ) , in seeking some hint as to which examples from the zoo of ti isotopic patterns might serve as a guide .",
    "we note that several samples show j  shape patterns in @xcite ; the same is true for @xcite , see in particular their figures 2 , 3 , and 11 .",
    "the patterns of many sic grains are quantitatively indistinguishable from those of agb models for an initial solar isotopic abundance .",
    "we show the measurements by @xcite for kjgm1 - 158 - 5 , which has a very large enrichment in @xmath4ti , in figure [ ti-1 ] . for comparison , we include the results for @xmath78 solar , normalized to the measured @xmath79 value .",
    "it can be seen that within the errors , the results are indistinguishable , if one considers the errors in both @xmath4ti/@xmath6ti and @xmath38ti/@xmath6ti .",
    "we now consider a wider number of samples , some of which have only more modest effects in @xmath79 ( down to 200 per mil ) .",
    "using data from @xcite and grains 101 , 58b , and 110 from @xcite , we show in figure [ ti-2 ] the results , normalized to the measured @xmath79 , including also error bars . again a set of normalized reference curves using the @xmath78 values are shown .",
    "some samples , such as kjgm4c-314 - 3 , appear to be widely deviant with a @xmath38ti shift above that of @xmath4ti .",
    "however , if one considers the one - sigma error bars of 20% for @xmath80 and of 24% for @xmath81 , there is no clear discrepancy . from these observations",
    "we conclude that a large fraction of these grains show clear evidence of @xmath11-processing .",
    "however , there are many cases that also show clear disagreement with significant @xmath11-processing . these differences , shown in figure [ ti-2 ] , would correspond to shifts in initial isotopic abundances of 100 per mil for some isotopes which are not enriched in the @xmath11-process calculations presented here .",
    "we are then left with the issue of what the variations are due to .",
    "many of the samples showing clear deviations from agb models still exhibit aspects of the j  or check  pattern .",
    "note that for @xmath77ti ( which is 8% of the total ti ) , a 5% increase in the @xmath77ti/@xmath6ti ratio would give ( relative to solar ) a 5% shift in @xmath77ti/@xmath6ti and change the j  pattern produced by @xmath11-processing into a v  pattern .",
    "there is a very strong indication that many of the variations observed represent @xmath11-processing , but from somewhat different initial isotopic compositions . when the @xmath11-process effects are large ( due to grain formation in very advanced evolutionary stages )",
    ", the ti isotopic pattern closely approaches that of pure @xmath11-processing .",
    "when instead grains form at earlier dredge - up episodes , then the initial composition dominates .",
    "[ [ si ] ] si ~~    we now consider si isotopic shifts in circons in the light of the above discussion of ti which shows clear evidence of @xmath11-processing , but with some intrinsic variability in the initial values due to granularity in the source ism .",
    "the data on sic grains ( main stream and a , b grains ) associated with agb stars exhibit a clear trend in the isotopic ratios of si , as found by other workers ( see figure 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "the fundamental issues on the isotopic composition of si in the ism were fully recognized and discussed by @xcite .",
    "these workers discussed the diversity of sne sources and the possibility that these effects could be used to trace earlier galactic evolution . the observed trend expressed in terms of @xmath82 versus @xmath83 has a slope close to ( or larger than ) unity , with some points displaced in the direction of a line of much smaller slope ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the slope of @xmath10 0.3 is calculated for a model with @xmath23 dependence for neutron capture cross sections .",
    "this inconsistency of predictions with the main trend of high slope was recognized by many authors .",
    "some significant efforts have been made to explain these results .",
    "we note that the cross sections do not follow the @xmath23 rule and are subject to large uncertainties , especially for @xmath85si ( franz kppeler & iris dillman , private communication ) .",
    "hence the slope predicted for agb stars may be more complex than previously assumed .",
    "it is dependent on the effectiveness of @xmath19c  burning and on the extension of the @xmath19c  reservoir . for small pockets ,",
    "the slope is small ( @xmath86 ) and determined mainly by neutrons from the @xmath12ne(@xmath13,n)@xmath14 mg reaction . for large extensions of the pocket the slope increases substantially , up to about 0.8 in our models . in no case can large enrichment factors for @xmath87si and @xmath85si be produced in agb envelopes , as the @xmath88si neutron capture cross section is small ( this is also the case for ca isotopes ) .",
    "while more advanced agb computations may change the results , we consider here that the sic measurements are plausibly explained by other important factors . in particular , the possible intrinsic local variability in si in the local ism from which the grains formed must be considered .",
    "it is of importance to note that the relative enrichment of si and ca effects from agb processing as compared with ti , here is rather low ( see table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , @xmath1fe and @xmath2ni should exhibit larger effects than @xmath4ti .",
    "for @xmath0cr there should be smaller effects than for @xmath4ti .",
    "thus , in consideration of the small variability ( 10% to 20% ) in the ism isotopic composition estimated from the ti data , we expect that the coupling of si data with ti due to agb processing will be very weak .",
    "the dominant effect for si is due to intrinsic variability in the contributions from distinctive sne sources .",
    "coupling the results for both si and ti caused many workers to invoke a model of galactic chemical evolution to interpret the observations . the original proposal to explain the o isotopic data in circons by galactic chemical evolution was made by @xcite and discussed further by @xcite in a stochastic model , considering mixing from different sources .",
    "efforts to relate the ti and si effects to galactic chemical evolution resulted in some difficulties .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite and by @xcite , the correlation lines for si and ti isotopes for the galactic evolution trend do not pass through the solar value .",
    "further , @xcite pointed out that the si trend could be explained if the role of sneia ejecta in producing @xmath88si was larger than assumed in the previous years . in an important paper by @xcite , after the work of @xcite , the following points were made : i ) that there was local heterogeneity in the ism at the time when the main stream  grains were formed ; and ii ) that there are shifts to be expected in the si isotopic abundances in the ism due to intrinsic variability in the ratios produced by core collapse sne and by sneia .",
    "these workers still argued that there are effects of galactic chemical evolution , but considered the possibility that there is intrinsic heterogeneity in the ism at essentially all times .",
    "the wide possible range in @xmath87si/@xmath88si and @xmath85si/@xmath88si presented by @xcite was based on the detailed sne yields by @xcite and is seen in a subsequent report by @xcite .",
    "we note that recently published yields of the si isotopes for sneia clearly indicate that , indeed , @xmath87si and @xmath85si are grossly under produced as compared to @xmath88si in the ejecta @xcite .",
    "sneia are major source of fe .",
    "the above authors showed that @xmath87si/@xmath88si @xmath10 1.96@xmath8910@xmath90 and @xmath85si/@xmath88si @xmath10 3.6@xmath8910@xmath90 .",
    "these are about 1/10th the solar values .",
    "the slope of a line connecting solar and these sneia values is 0.93 in the @xmath82 versus @xmath83 .",
    "about 15@xmath6445% of the @xmath88si in the bulk solar inventory is from sneia sources @xcite and all of the remainder is from sneii .",
    "the various sneii sources ( depending on mass ) show a wide spread in si isotopic abundances @xcite . calculating a grand canonical average using an initial mass function that gives the large scale solar si isotopic ratios provides a plausible base line as a guide .",
    "however , assuming solar abundances as a universal rule is not plausible .",
    "it is evident that the bulk solar value is the result of a blend of diverse sources with much of the @xmath87si and @xmath85si coming from very massive stars ( @xmath16 30@xmath3 , see * ? ? ?",
    "if we consider inhomogeneities in the ism resulting from rather small variations in the mixing ratios , then a 1 - 10% change in the contribution of sneia sources to a local star formation region would result in a shift of 100 per mil for si isotopes .",
    "this is essentially the trend that is observed for the mainstream and the a and b grains ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , one must further note that the si data show that the @xmath91 grains and the @xmath24 grains are displaced to the right of the main array ( which has a slope of @xmath92 1 ) .",
    "it is possible that this displacement is due to agb processing of materials that were on the slope @xmath76 line . in general , the @xmath71 grains ( which have very negative deltas ) are recognized as having rather direct connections with sne condensates .",
    "the aforementioned study by @xcite of a stochastic sampling of sne ejecta from different sources found that this approach does not reproduce the strong correlation between @xmath87si/@xmath88si and @xmath77ti/@xmath6ti ratios observed in circon grains .",
    "however , this approach attributes both si and ti isotopic effects to sne . if the dominant effects for ti in mainstream circons are due to agb re - processing and the si effects are from sne , then this correlation is not applicable .",
    "the o isotopic patterns are in many cases not well understood and may indeed require sne contributions .",
    "more work is needed on this subject with full attention given to intrinsic heterogeneities in the ism .",
    "we infer that the si isotopic data of circons found in meteorites are plausibly explained by modest variability in the isotopic composition of si in star forming regions .",

    "considering the fact that from 1/2 to 2/3 of all the fe nuclei must come from these sources , which produce @xmath88si and very little @xmath87si and @xmath85si , this appears to be a plausible cause of the observed trend , as early suggested by @xcite .",
    "we consider the granularity of the ism composition to be the greater governing agent for most of the data reported on si and ca and any coupling between @xmath11-processing for ti , cr , fe , and ni with si and ca will be weak , because of the low effects resulting from @xmath11-processing on silicon and calcium themselves .",
    "we note that the calculations , both in the stellar models and in the data representations , use solar reference isotopic values .",
    "as derived from equations ( 9 ) , ( 12 ) , and ( 13 ) the enrichment factor relative to the solar reference ( expressed by the factor @xmath118 ) is ( see equation ( 16 ) : @xmath119 this is calculated for a sample formed in the envelope of a star that did not have an initially solar isotopic composition ( see section 2.3.3 for details ) .",
    "this simple relation connects the calculated laboratory data relative to solar standards to the value that would be in a model star of solar initial isotopic admixture , but is actually offset by the actual initial composition through the abundance factor @xmath118 .",
    "this permits of determining the initial composition of the source if one @xmath118 can be estimated .",
    "a shift due to @xmath118 will be very significant ( e.g. for @xmath120 , this is a 1% , or 10@xmath121 @xmath61 unit shift in the isotopic ratio ) .",
    "support for possible isotopic variability may be found in the known variability in chemical abundances for stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath122 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "certainly , 10% to 20% shifts must be expected in the ism . the case for galactic changes",
    "will be more clearly defined when the observational data and theory require metallicities much below solar and hence significantly earlier epochs .",
    "this may be applicable for some of the oxygen results in the report by @xcite .",
    "the role of heterogeneity that we invoke has been widely known , but only in connection with much larger scale issues of galactic chemical evolution . as noted by @xcite ( section 4.2.3 ) : the fact that the total spread in the grain data is larger than is expected for nucleosynthesis in a single o - rich agb star suggests that much of the range indeed reflects variations in initial compositions due to gce .",
    "this is analogous to the case for si and ti isotopes in presolar sic grains @xcite .",
    "we concur that the variations reveal variable initial compositions ; however we believe that they reflect the intrinsic granularity and heterogeneity of the local ism from which stars form and , to a lesser extent , some effects of broader - scale galactic chemical evolution . for this last , the issue is to identify circon grains which _ require _ low metallicity to explain their isotopic data .",
    "the ism does not have an exactly solar isotopic composition , but is heterogeneous both in time and space . that there is a difference in the initial composition of the sources",
    "has long been recognized by many workers @xcite .",
    "we agree with previous researchers that the silicon and titanium isotope arrays exhibited by presolar sic grains reflect primarily the initial compositions of the parent stars , overprinted by a component of @xmath11-process nucleosynthesis ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however the small @xmath11-components are the effect of early stages of dredge up , which emphasize the inherited component ; while more advanced stages are dominated by the @xmath11-process itself .",
    "measurements of the isotopes @xmath0cr , @xmath1fe , and @xmath2ni are very difficult using sims techniques , because of the isobaric interferences .",
    "however , some aspects of the agb effects can be reconstructed with complete data sets of ti , cr , fe , and ni on single samples of cais .",
    "insofar as the isotopic effects are sufficiently large , it should be possible to establish whether the predicted isotopic correlations are really found .",
    "for example , the absence of @xmath1fe in the presence of excess @xmath2ni or of high @xmath4ti values would cast serious doubts on the approach presented here .    a careful assessment should now be made of the codes for @xmath11-process in agb stars with a focus on the fe group elements , so that errors in the nuclear physics or the codes are not propagated in our models .",
    "more broadly , the general consequences for all nuclides of the results of re - processing ism matter in agb stars requires careful attention for all affected nuclei , including radioactive isotopes .",
    "attempts at identifying contributions from galactic chemical evolution ( not from local granularity ) should be focused on circons grains that may reasonably be considered to come from stars with [ fe / h ] values well below zero .",
    "very high enrichments of @xmath4ti may aid in identifying such grains .",
    "further work in this field may also be directed to look for correlations between some of the signatures discussed in the present paper and the several recent reports on very small isotopic variations in many heavier elements ( eg mo , ru , hf , and w ) , which show @xmath11-process excesses or deficits in leaches of various meteoritic materials .",
    "the problems associated with leaching experiments for different chemical elements will of course remain .    *",
