    "the supernova sn 2001em was discovered on 2001 september 20 @xcite in the galaxy ugc 11794 ( @xmath8 ) . with an apparent magnitude of about 18.6 and absolute magnitude of @xmath9 at the time of discovery ( for @xmath10 mpc ) , the supernova was present in an unfiltered image on september 15 but not on september 5 at a level of 19.5 mag @xcite .",
    "the spectrum on 2001 october 20 was of type ib or ic a month after maximum brightness @xcite .",
    "there is little doubt that sn  2001em was discovered early , probably before maximum light .",
    "we adopt 2001 september 10 , i.e. jd=2452163 , as the time of explosion . the 5 day uncertainty in the age",
    "is of no consequence for the interpretation of the late observations considered here .",
    "two years after the explosion , on 2003 october 17 , sn  2001em was detected at radio wavelengths with the vla at 3.6 cm . between then and 2004 january 30 ,",
    "the flux at 3.6 cm increased by a factor of @xmath11 @xcite , and by a factor of 1.56 to 2004 july 1 @xcite .",
    "the spectrum in the range @xmath12 cm was nonthermal , @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the high radio luminosity @xmath14 erg s@xmath5 hz@xmath5 at 6 cm @xcite is unprecedented for a sn  ib / c at this age .",
    "moreover , x - ray observations on 2004 april 4 ( day 937 ) with _ chandra _ revealed x - ray emission in the @xmath15 kev band with a luminosity of @xmath16 erg s@xmath5 @xcite , again unprecedented for a sn  ib / c at this age .",
    "the circumstellar ( cs ) medium in the immediate vicinity of sne  ib / c is presumably shaped by a wolf - rayet ( wr ) type wind .",
    "the interaction with this wind is normally expected to produce early radio emission that decays with a fairly steep power law in time ( e.g. , sn  1983n , * ? ? ?",
    "although the emission would normally be undetectable at an age of 2 years , @xcite undertook late observations of sne ib / c based on the suggestion that strong late radio emission could be caused by the interaction of a misaligned relativistic jet with the wr wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite discussed misaligned jet and cs interaction models for the late emission from sn  2001em and concluded that the misaligned jet model was favored .",
    "a prediction of their model was that the radio source should be resolvable with vlbi ( very long baseline interferometry ) observations , with an angular size @xmath17 mas .",
    "vlbi observations have been undertaken by 2 groups @xcite , both of which failed to resolve the source at the predicted size ; bietenholz & bartel set an upper limit on the major axis angular size of 0.59 mas .",
    "although the vlbi observations do not support the misaligned jet model , the model might not be ruled out if there is relativistic motion of a compact radio source",
    ".    however , detection of a strong h@xmath0 emission line with fwhm of @xmath18 on 2004 may 7 @xcite is not readily explained in the misaligned jet model .",
    "this type of emission is observed from supernovae which are undergoing strong cs interaction and usually associated with type iin supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the high radio and x - ray luminosities of sn 2001em at an age @xmath19 days are comparable to those of bright type iin supernovae ( e.g. , sn 1986j , sn 1988z ) at a similar age . given this similarity",
    ", we propose a model of sn 2001em that accounts for the observed phenomena by interaction of a sn  ib / c with a dense cs shell that is some distance from the progenitor and was initially part of the h envelope of the progenitor star .",
    "general aspects of our model are discussed in ",
    "[ sec - general ] and more details are in   [ sec - model ] .",
    "the model results are compared to observations of sn  2001em in ",
    "[ sec - result ] and the formation of the circumstellar shell is treated in ",
    "[ sec - origin ] .",
    "the conclusions , with attention to the evolutionary status of the sn  2001em progenitor , are in   [ sec - conc ] .",
    "we assume that sn  2001em exploded as an ordinary sn  ib / c , and the late x - ray , radio and h@xmath0  emission were the outcome of the ejecta interaction with a dense cs hydrogen shell lost by the progenitor star .",
    "this conjecture implies that the cs environment around sn  2001em was shaped by two episodes of mass loss : heavy mass loss in a slow red supergiant wind ( possibly in a common envelope phase or a superwind phase ) and a subsequent rarefied , fast wr wind .",
    "this wr wind caused the formation of a dense cs shell by the interaction of the fast wind with a slow dense wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the wr stage following the loss of the hydrogen envelope was relatively brief , so the stellar mass could not have decreased significantly at this stage .",
    "we expect , therefore , that the sn  2001em presupernova was the he core of a massive star . a related example is sn  1993j , which originated from a `` typical '' mass range @xmath20 and got rid of almost all the h envelope @xcite . for sn  2001em",
    ", we adopt an ejecta mass of @xmath21 and an energy of @xmath22 erg , similar to parameters found for sn  1993j ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; in   [ sec - dyn ] , we consider variation of these parameters . with the adopted parameters ,",
    "the typical velocity of sn material is @xmath23 cm s@xmath5 . assuming that x - rays from sn  2001em at @xmath24 d detected by _ chandra _",
    "@xcite correspond to the stage of strong interaction with the cs shell , the radius of the cs shell is then @xmath25 cm . the typical supernova velocity ( or less ) must be chosen if the supernova energy has substantially thermalized ; on the other hand , the rising radio flux implies that the interaction is not highly evolved .",
    "the hydrogen envelope was presumably lost during the red supergiant stage with a velocity @xmath26 cm s@xmath5 .",
    "the cs shell was likely accelerated by the wr wind to a velocity @xmath27 , so the age may be @xmath28 yr (  [ sec - origin ] ) .",
    "the shock interaction of freely expanding sn ejecta ( @xmath29 ) with a cs shell proceeds through the formation of a double shock interface layer with the forward shock accelerating the cs gas and the reverse shock decelerating sn ejecta .",
    "the swept up hot gas between the two shocks is responsible for x - rays , while the accelerated electrons and amplified magnetic field in the interaction zone bring about the synchrotron radio emission @xcite . the h@xmath0  emission line with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath30 km s@xmath5 detected on day 970 @xcite",
    "is probably emitted by the cs gas accelerated in the forward shock , since the sn ejecta are devoid of hydrogen .",
    "the h@xmath0  profile has no apparent extended wings beyond a velocity of @xmath31 km s@xmath5 @xcite , which implies that the bulk of the line - emitting gas in the forward shock moves with velocities @xmath32 km s@xmath5 .",
    "two possibilities for the origin of the high velocity hydrogen in the forward shock are : ( i ) a shock wave with a velocity @xmath33 km s@xmath5 that passed through the smooth dense cs shell was radiative , so a cool dense shell formed between the shock wave and the contact surface ; ( ii ) the dense cs shell was clumpy , so the clouds were first shocked by slow radiative shocks , and then fragments of the shocked clouds were accelerated in the forward shock up to @xmath33 km s@xmath5 , similar to the scenario proposed for the h@xmath0  emission in sn  2002ic @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the forward shock with a velocity of @xmath33 km s@xmath5 is about @xmath34 kev , far below the 80 kev estimated from _",
    "observations on day 940 @xcite",
    ". the reverse shock can be much hotter . as a result of the sudden collision of the rarefied outer sn layers with the dense cs shell ,",
    "the swept up shell at the sn / cs interface is strongly decelerated because of a high cs / sn density contrast @xmath35 .",
    "the swept up shell velocity @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the velocity of sn ejecta at the reverse shock , is low and , consequently , the reverse shock velocity @xmath38 is high enough to provide a high temperature of the shocked sn ejecta .",
    "an additional factor that favors a high temperature at the reverse shock is an average molecular weight of ejecta that is larger than for normal cosmic abundances . for the ionized he composition of sn",
    "ib / c , @xmath39 , so the velocity of the reverse shock must be only @xmath40 km s@xmath5 to yield a shock temperature of 80 kev . with the velocity of the swept up shell @xmath41 km s@xmath5 , the boundary ejecta velocity should be @xmath42 km s@xmath5 at the time of x - ray observation",
    ". the actual picture may be more complicated , because the x - ray emission is a combination of the radiation from both shocks with different temperatures .",
    "we now estimate the mass of the shocked sn ejecta assuming that the reverse shock is the dominant component . with the standard bremsstrahlung cooling function @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the ion charge for pure he",
    ", we find that the observed x - rays with @xmath45  k ( i.e. 80 kev ) and luminosity @xmath46 erg s@xmath5 require an emission measure @xmath47 @xmath48 .",
    "to estimate the mass of the shocked ejecta , the volume of the reverse postshock layer between the reverse shock and the contact surface should be determined .",
    "let sn ejecta with a power low density distribution @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 at @xmath52 collide with a dense narrow cs shell .",
    "the ratio of the radius of the reverse shock to the radius of the contact surface @xmath53 in that case is @xcite @xmath54 substituting @xmath55 gives @xmath56 . for @xmath57",
    "cm , @xmath58 , and @xmath47 @xmath48 , the mass of the shocked ejecta is @xmath59 .",
    "momentum conservation implies that the cs shell mass required to decelerate @xmath60 of the sn ejecta with the typical velocity of @xmath61 km s@xmath5 down to @xmath62 km s@xmath5 is @xmath63 .",
    "given the age of the cs shell of @xmath19 yr , the last episode of the hydrogen envelope removal thus occurred with a mass loss rate of @xmath64 yr@xmath5 .",
    "below we present a more detailed interaction model that will confirm this general picture , although with some modifications regarding the interpretation of the x - ray spectrum (  [ sec - dyn ] ) .",
    "this consideration of the x - ray luminosity shows that the mass of the cs shell must be comparable to the ejecta mass , so that the supernova energy is substantially thermalized .",
    "although the radio luminosity was rising at an age of 7701000 days , we expect that the luminosity can not rise much further because the interaction energy can not keep increasing .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the luminosity of sn 2001em is comparable to that of the most luminous radio and x - ray supernovae at a comparable age .",
    "the situation can be compared to that in sn 1987a , which is known to have a dense ring at a radius of @xmath65 cm , about an order of magnitude larger than the dense shell inferred here .",
    "the radio flux from sn 1987a started to rise at an age of 3 yr @xcite , but at a luminosity level orders of magnitude smaller that the luminosity observed in sn 2001em ; the initial interaction is with the outer , high velocity , low density ejecta , which have only a small part of the supernova energy .",
    "in addition , the mass in the cs shell is probably considerably less than the ejecta mass , so that only a fraction of the supernova energy will have been thermalized at the time that the cs shell is swept up .",
    "we consider freely expanding ( @xmath29 ) sn ejecta interacting with a cs environment consisting of a massive dense cs shell placed between the wr wind ( inner zone ) and the slow red supergiant wind ( outer zone ) .",
    "the sn ejecta mass is taken to be @xmath21 , the kinetic energy is @xmath22 erg , and the density distribution has a flat inner zone , @xmath51 at @xmath52 , and a power law outer layer , @xmath49 for @xmath50 with @xmath55 .",
    "the wr wind is set by the wind density parameter @xmath66 g cm@xmath5 which corresponds to the choice @xmath68 yr@xmath5 and the wind velocity of @xmath69 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this wind has little effect on the late time interaction because of its low density , and we neglect the fact that the wr wind has to pass through a shock wave inside the cs shell .",
    "the assumed width of the dense cs shell is @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the average radius of the cs shell .",
    "the density in the cs shell is characterized by the density parameter @xmath72 , which is defined by the shell radius and the shell mass with the assumed @xmath73 ratio . in   [ sec - den ] , we show that the assumed shell thickness and density are consistent with expectations .",
    "the outer wind at @xmath74 is presumably the slow dense wind of a red supergiant and we take @xmath75 g cm@xmath5 , an intermediate value between the wind densities expected for a sn  iip and a bright sn  iil .",
    "we explored other values and found that , provided @xmath76 g cm@xmath5 , the results are not sensitive to this parameter .",
    "the two versions of the density distribution of the cs matter ( csm ) that will be used below are shown in fig .",
    "[ f - density ] .",
    "the models differ in the radius of the cs shell . in model",
    "a , the interaction with the cs shell is not yet finished by the time of the x - ray observation ( @xmath77 d ) , while model b , with a smaller shell radius , represents a situation where the cs shell was swept up prior to the x - ray observation .",
    "the hydrodynamic evolution of the sn interaction is treated in the thin shell approximation @xcite , i.e. the layer between forward and reverse shocks is replaced by a thin layer .",
    "this description yields the radius of the thin shell @xmath78 , the shell velocity @xmath79 , and the boundary velocity of the unshocked sn ejecta @xmath37 at an age @xmath80 .",
    "the velocities of the forward shock ( @xmath81 ) and reverse shock ( @xmath38 ) provide us with kinetic luminosities for both shocks .",
    "the kinetic luminosities can be converted into x - ray luminosities if they are multiplied by a factor @xmath82 which is determined by the ratio of the cooling time @xmath83 and the time of accumulation of the shock internal energy @xmath84 .",
    "usually , @xmath85 is assumed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and this is appropriate for interaction with a smooth wind . in the case of a collision with a narrow cs shell one",
    "expects @xmath86 , so it is more appropriate to use the directly calculated value of @xmath87 .",
    "however , this approach based upon the instant kinetic luminosity is not valid at a very late epoch , when the forward shock has overrun the dense shell ( @xmath88 ) and propagates into the rarefied wind . the radiation from the large mass of shocked cs gas left behind by the previous interaction should dominate .",
    "we treat the thermal history of the outer hot gas by solving the time - dependent energy balance with the internal energy generation in the forward shock , adiabatic cooling ( dominant term ) , and radiative cooling . to obtain the density of the outer hot gas ,",
    "we assume that the shell expands homologously and @xmath89 .",
    "this approximation is supported by the fact that the spherical expansion of a gas cloud proceeds in a self - similar way with a boundary velocity comparable to the initial thermal velocity @xcite , i.e. the shell speed in our case .",
    "the model simulations show that model a assuming a smooth cs density predicts a larger absorption of x - rays than indicated by the observations .",
    "therefore , we assumed a clumpy structure of the cs shell to reduce the absorption . in model",
    "b the x - rays do not constrain the structure of the cs shell , because it has been already shocked at the time of observation .",
    "we approximate the interaction with a clumpy cs shell by including the clumpiness _ only _ for the absorption computation , while the interaction dynamics and the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of both shocks are described assuming a _ smooth _ cs shell with an average density .",
    "this approximation , although crude at first glance , is justified if cs clouds entering the forward shock fully deposit their kinetic energy , which means that clouds are completely crushed , fragmented and mixed within the forward shock .",
    "this picture amounts to the assumption that , for cs clouds of radius @xmath90 , the cloud crushing time @xmath91 @xcite is significantly less than the time required for a cs cloud to cross the forward shock region with width @xmath92 , i.e. , @xmath93 .",
    "we return to this issue below (  [ sec - dyn ] ) .",
    "the question arises of whether model a with a smooth density can adequately represent the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of the forward shock in the cloudy cs gas is a combination of radiation from the hot intercloud gas and cooler cloud shocks , which can not be treated properly in the smooth approximation .",
    "fortunately , the x - ray emission of cloud shocks does not affect markedly the amount of internal energy generated by the forward shock in the intercloud gas .",
    "the point is that the total kinetic luminosity of slow cloud shocks is a factor of @xmath94 ( where @xmath95 is cloud - to - intercloud density ratio in the forward shock ) smaller than the kinetic luminosity of fast bow shocks .",
    "therefore , most of the internal energy in the forward shock region resides in the hot intercloud gas .",
    "the approximation of a smooth forward shock region for the clumpy model a may be satisfactory for the x - ray spectrum in the range @xmath96 kev . yet a sizable amount of the kinetic luminosity of the forward shock interacting with a clumpy cs shell is expected to be emitted by cloud shocks in the soft band ( @xmath97 kev ) .",
    "most of this radiation is presumably absorbed and re - emitted in the optical / uv band outside of the x - ray band of interest .",
    "the observed x - ray spectrum is affected by four cool components , including ( 1 ) galactic absorption and intrinsic absorption in ( 2 ) unshocked sn ejecta ; ( 3 ) unshocked cs gas ; and ( 4 ) shocked cool h@xmath0-emitting gas .",
    "the reddening towards sn  2001em is @xmath98 @xcite , which corresponds to a column density @xmath99 @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "we take this value as the total column density in the first cool component , neglecting interstellar absorption in the host galaxy .",
    "the sn ejecta can absorb x - rays , despite the fact that ejecta gas can be heated up to @xmath101  k. the smooth outer wind in the region @xmath74 irradiated by x - rays becomes hot ( @xmath102  k ) for @xmath103 g cm@xmath5 and is not a significant absorber of radio .",
    "however the outer wind absorbs x - rays , although carbon and oxygen may be ionized up to he- and h - like ions .    as noted above , the cs shell in model a has to be clumpy to be consistent with the low x - ray absorption .",
    "the optical depth of the clumpy cs shell is computed as @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the outer radius of the cs region taken to be @xmath106 cm , @xmath107 is the number density of clouds , @xmath108 is the cloud filling factor , @xmath109 is the mass fraction of the intercloud phase ( we take @xmath110 ) and @xmath111 is the ratio of cloud density to the local average density , @xmath112 is the cloud average optical depth , and @xmath113 is the absorption coefficient for x - rays with energy @xmath114 . the occultation optical depth of the cs shell along the radius , @xmath115 , should be of order unity or less to provide reasonable transparency . with fixed @xmath109 and @xmath111 , the only remaining parameter that determines @xmath116 is the cloud radius @xmath90 .",
    "the x - ray absorption by the unshocked sn ejecta is determined by integrating the radiation transfer equation along rays with different impact parameters for the assumed density distribution .",
    "we found that the absorption of radio emission by sn material has a small effect on the emergent spectrum , so we treat it approximately in terms of the average values of the electron number density and the temperature of the ejecta irradiated by x - rays .",
    "in model b , only the outer wind and fourth component ( h@xmath0-emitting gas ) can provide intrinsic x - ray absorption . to treat the latter we assume that @xmath117% of the shocked cs gas resides in the cool h@xmath0-emitting gas ; the result is insensitive to the value in this range .",
    "this gas is probably distributed in the form of heterogeneous structures ( knots , filaments , sheets ) imbedded in the hot gas of the forward shock .",
    "we assume that hot and cool gas are homogeneously mixed . in this case",
    "the absorption by the fourth component is characterized by the optical depth @xmath118 for the average column density , and by the occultation optical depth ( the average number of clouds along the radius ) @xmath119 .",
    "the optical depth for the x - ray radiation transmitted through the forward shock layer derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq - taux ] ) is then @xmath120.\\ ] ] for photons emitted in a layer along the normal to the surface , the intensity of escaping radiation is @xmath121/\\tau_4 $ ] , where the @xmath122 is the unabsorbed intensity .",
    "we adopt the same expression for the flux of radiation escaping from layer @xmath123/\\tau_4 $ ] .",
    "however , for the radiation escaping through the inner surface we additionally have to take into account the absorption in the sn ejecta ( e@xmath124 ) and absorption in the h@xmath0-emitting gas at the opposite side of the forward shock ( e@xmath125 ) . for the radio emission , we assume also that the h@xmath0-emitting material is homogeneously mixed with the radio - emitting shell .",
    "this is an approximation to a complicated situation in which the forward and reverse shock regions both contribute to the acceleration of relativistic electrons and magnetic field amplification , so , generally , the radio - emitting shell and the h@xmath0-emitting material may not overlap exactly .",
    "the free - free absorption of the radio emission by the cs shell depends on the ionization fraction of hydrogen ( @xmath126 ) and the electron temperature of the cool components .",
    "these values are calculated taking into account that the absorbed energy of x - rays is shared between coulomb heating , excitation and ionization .",
    "we assume that the latter two processes have equal branching ratios .",
    "for the coulomb heating we adopt a branching ratio @xmath127 , a reasonable approximation if the ionization fraction @xmath128 @xcite . the cooling term in the energy balance",
    "is calculated using a standard cooling function for solar composition @xcite .",
    "if the thermal balance can not maintain the cool phase ( @xmath129 k ) we adopt full ionization and consider this gas as transparent .",
    "the typical value of the ionization fraction of the clouds at about 900 day is @xmath130 and temperature @xmath131  k , while the intercloud gas is hot ( @xmath132  k ) and thus does not absorb radio emission . for the h@xmath0-emitting gas the typical ionization is @xmath133 and temperature @xmath134 k. in the sn ejecta",
    "the helium is fully ionized and the electron temperature is @xmath135 k.    the unabsorbed x - ray spectrum is modelled by thermal bremsstrahlung with a non - relativistic gaunt factor @xcite .",
    "the photoionization cross sections for the absorption by electrons of k and l shells with @xmath136 and @xmath137 subshells are taken from @xcite .",
    "solar abundances are assumed for the csm , while the sn  ib / c ejecta are approximated by a mixture of 65% he , 33% o , and 2% fe by mass .",
    "we now discuss models that fit the basic observations of sn 2001em .",
    "the parameters of the cs shell for models a and b , namely , the inner and outer radius of the cs shell ( @xmath138 and @xmath139 ) , the density parameter of the cs shell ( @xmath72 ) , and the total mass of the cs shell are given in table 1 ( see also fig .",

    "the collision results in a rise of the x - ray luminosities of both shocks toward their maximum values , @xmath144 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "the maxima occur at the phase when the cs shell has been swept up , i.e. at @xmath145 d and @xmath146 d for models a and b respectively .",
    "the luminosity of the shocked cs gas remains high after the cs shell has been overtaken ; the temperature , however , rapidly decreases for @xmath147 d due to adiabatic cooling .",
    "the contribution of the forward shock to the internal energy of the shocked cs gas at a late epoch is negligible for @xmath148 d. at the time of the h@xmath0  observation ( @xmath149 d ) , the thin shell velocity is 2200 km s@xmath5 in model a and 3200 km s@xmath5 in model b ; both are consistent with the observed h@xmath0width .    the calculated x - ray spectra for both models ( fig .",
    "[ f - xsp ] ) reproduce the data of @xcite quite satisfactorily .",
    "note that model a has a clumpy cs shell here ; a smooth cs shell produces too strong absorption ( fig .",

    "the fit quality for both models is comparable to that of the isothermal hot spectrum with @xmath150 kev ( fig .",
    "[ f - xsp ] , inset ) and with external absorption corresponding to @xmath151 @xmath100 , the value reported by @xcite .",
    "the unabsorbed spectrum in our models is a mixture of the hot ( @xmath152 kev ) radiation of the reverse shock and `` cool '' ( @xmath153 kev ) radiation of the forward shock with comparable luminosities ( fig .",
    "[ f - dynamics ] ) .",
    "in fact , the cooler component dominates in the range @xmath154 kev .",
    "we thus come to a picture in which the data are reproduced by a relatively cool spectrum subjected to the intrinsic absorption by the clumpy cool material , so the emergent spectrum succesfully mimics the observed hot isothermal spectrum ( @xmath155 kev ) with a smooth external absorber .",
    "although the general picture presented earlier (    [ sec - general ] ) is based on the view that the x - rays are represented by a hot isothermal spectrum , the mass estimate is not appreciably changed , because the luminosity of the hot component is comparable to the total luminosity .",

    "here we concentrate on the absorption effects of both free - free absorption and synchrotron self - absorption , and consider some implications of the radio evolution .",
    "our analysis is based on the assumptions that relativistic electrons with a power law spectrum , @xmath171 ( the spectral index is @xmath172 for @xmath173 ) , and magnetic field @xmath174 are distributed homogeneously in a spherical shell with width @xmath175 and radius @xmath78 ; the radius is provided by the interaction dynamics . the radio - emitting shell is assumed to be homogeneously mixed with the cool clumpy h@xmath0-emitting gas .",
    "we assume a minimum energy of the relativistic electrons of 1  mev , energy equipartition between magnetic field and relativistic particles , and equipartition between relativistic electrons and protons . given the interaction model , the remaining free parameter is the ratio ( @xmath176 ) of the energy density of magnetic field plus relativistic particles to the kinetic energy density of the forward shock .    the effects of ssa ( synchrotron self - absorption ) and free - free absorption on the radio spectrum in model a and model b",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ f - rsp ] along with data on 2004 january 31 @xcite .",
    "the optimal parameters are @xmath177 , @xmath178 in model a and @xmath179 , @xmath180 in model b. we found that the variation of the sn ejecta parameters in the low energy and high mass models (   [ sec - dyn ] ) results in a 10% variation of the parameter @xmath176 with practically the same fit to the spectrum on day 872 .",
    "the derived values of @xmath176 imply a magnetic field @xmath181 g in both models at the time under consideration .",
    "for this magnetic field , synchrotron losses become important ( i.e. @xmath182 yr ) at frequencies @xmath183 hz . in the observed frequency range ( @xmath184 hz ) , the spectrum is not affected by synchrotron cooling .",
    "the spectrum without free - free absorption demonstrates that ssa is significant for @xmath185 hz .",
    "the importance of ssa could be deduced from equation ( 13 ) of @xcite , which shows that the size of the radio emitting region at which the shell turns optically thin is comparable to the size of the shell found here .",
    "an observation of sn 2001em on 11 march 2005 at 1.6 ghz showed a considerably lower flux than would have been expected from the higher frequency flux evolution @xcite , which can be interpreted as a low frequency turnover or a sudden flux decline .",
    "our results are consistent with a low frequency turnover . the spectral inversion at @xmath186 hz is related to the transparency of absorbing clumps at high frequencies .",
    "the mechanisms for particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification , especially in the case with a cloudy structure of the cs shell , are uncertain .",
    "the evolution of the radio flux , therefore , can not be predicted with confidence .",
    "assuming that the energy of relativistic electrons and magnetic field is a constant fraction of the kinetic energy ( i.e. , @xmath187 ) , we find that in model a the radio flux at 3.6 cm on day 767 is @xmath188 times lower compared to the observed flux , while on day 1025 the model flux is @xmath189 larger .",
    "this implies that the parameter @xmath176 should drop by factor of three between days 767 and 1025 . in model b assuming a smooth cs shell , the flux on day 767 is 30 times lower owing to strong absorption in the cs shell . on the other hand , assuming a clumpy cs shell with the same clumpiness parameters as in model a , we are able to reproduce in model b the flux evolution between day 767 and 1024 with @xmath190 .",
    "this analysis indicates that model b with a clumpy cs shell is somewhat preferred from the point of view of the interpretation of x - ray and radio data .      as remarked above (   [ sec - general ] ) , the h@xmath0  emission line on day 970 @xcite indicates the presence of cool shocked cs gas behind the forward shock front .",
    "we stress that in model b with the overtaken cs shell , the forward shock is adiabatic for a smooth density distribution and the assumed cs width @xmath89 .",
    "the shock becomes radiative if the density is at least factor of three larger , i.e. @xmath191 @xmath48 .",
    "this requires either a factor of three narrower cs shell , i.e. @xmath192 , or , alternatively , the cs shell could be clumpy . the latter option is preferred because the radio data , as noted above , also suggest a clumpy structure for the cs shell in model b. to be consistent with the h@xmath0  observation , the cool gas in the forward shock of model b must survive at least during @xmath193 days after it has been shocked .",
    "this is plausible , although the survival of cool gas in the hot environment is a complicated issue , because it is related to the poorly defined mass exchange between cool and hot phases , especially in the presence of magnetic field .",
    "the dense shocked cool hydrogen re - emits the absorbed x - rays , producing h@xmath0 .",
    "the h@xmath0  luminosity can be written as a fraction of the x - ray luminosity of the forward shock absorbed by the fast cool hydrogen multiplied by the efficiency @xmath194 of the h@xmath0  emission .",

    "] ) is then @xmath213 erg s@xmath5 at about day 1000 for @xmath214 . a comparable amount of a cool gas in model b would produce a similar h@xmath0  luminosity .",
    "these estimates ignore the clumpiness of the h@xmath0-emitting gas that might slightly reduce the luminosity . on the other hand",
    ", we also ignored the effect of thermal coductivity that might somewhat increase the h@xmath0  luminosity .",
    "unfortunately , the observed h@xmath0  flux is not yet available ; its value would provide a useful constraint on models .",
    "an implication of the sn / csm interaction model is the possible existence of a narrow h@xmath0 line from the ionized pre - shock cs gas . for model",
    "a the luminosity of the narrow h@xmath0 is @xmath215 erg s@xmath5 on day 1000 , i.e. @xmath216% of the broad h@xmath0  line . in model b with the overtaken cs shell",
    ", a narrow h@xmath0 line is not expected . a search for narrow h@xmath0  emission could provide a test for the presence of dense unshocked cs gas .",
    "the large mass and high density of the cs shell suggest the following formation scenario : loss of the hydrogen envelope @xmath19 yr before the supernova , possibly during a common envelope phase or the superwind phase of a single star @xcite , and the subsequent sweeping up of this matter by the fast wind of the hot he star .",
    "we thus envisage three major phases of the cs shell formation : ( i ) mass - loss of the hydrogen envelope ( @xmath217 ) ; ( ii ) sweeping up the shell by the wr wind ( @xmath218 ) ; and ( iii ) acceleration of the swept up shell by the wr wind ( @xmath219 ) .",
    "@xcite have simulated this sequence of events , although for different stellar parameters . to estimate the age at the moment of the sn explosion ( @xmath220 ) , we use the average parameters of our models : final cs shell radius @xmath221 cm and the mass of the cs shell @xmath222 .",
    "the velocity of the mass - loss at stage i is assumed equal to the typical red supergiant escape velocity @xmath223 km s@xmath5 , while the mass - loss rate at this stage @xmath224 is a free parameter to be determined . for the wr wind ,",
    "the assumed parameters are the same as stated above , i.e. @xmath225 km s@xmath5 and @xmath226 yr@xmath5 .    the mass - loss rate at the first stage can be constrained using the following arguments .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath224 is determined by the condition that at least the two first dynamical phases should pass with the correct final radius of the cs shell ( @xmath227 cm ) .",
    "the second phase is needed to build the density of the cs shell up to a value consistent with our models .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath228 yr@xmath5 is obtained assuming that the average density parameter @xmath229 g cm@xmath5 in our models ( table 1 ) corresponds to the unperturbed cs shell ejected by the presupernova .",
    "the duration of the first phase is @xmath230 . to estimate the time length of phase ii",
    ", we consider the interaction of two steady winds .",
    "the interaction proceeds in the pressure - dominated regime , i.e. the wr wind termination shock has a relatively small radius . in that case",
    "the swept - up shell expands with the constant velocity @xmath231 determined by the cubic equation @xcite @xmath232 in phase iii , a thin shell of mass @xmath233 is driven by the pressure of the shocked wr wind with the kinetic luminosity @xmath234 and the internal energy of the shocked wind ( bubble ) @xmath114 .",
    "a similar problem for the shell pushed by a pulsar wind has been solved earlier @xcite .",
    "the difference is in the adiabatic index : here we have @xmath235 instead of 4/3 .",
    "the equation of motion of the shell is then @xmath236 while the energy equation is @xmath237 the solution of these equations is the self - similar evolution of the cs shell radius @xmath238 to apply this solution to the phase iii of the cs shell expansion , we identify the period @xmath219 with the time taken by the cs shell to expand in the self - similar regime from the radius @xmath239 at @xmath240 to the final radius @xmath241 .    for the parameters adopted in model b and the maximum mass - loss rate during stage i ( @xmath228 yr@xmath5 ) , the phases i , ii , and iii end at @xmath242 yr , @xmath243 yr , and @xmath244 yr respectively . the cs shell velocity at the moment @xmath220 is @xmath245 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the existence of the acceleration phase @xmath219 provides in this case a natural mechanism for the fragmentation of the cs shell by the growth of the rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite .",
    "the minimum mass - loss rate at stage i , determined from the requirement that stage ii should end just prior to the sn explosion , is @xmath246 yr@xmath5 . in this case",
    "@xmath247 yr , @xmath248 yr , and the shell velocity is 33 km s@xmath5 .",
    "we thus conclude that a major mass - loss episode with the rate @xmath249 yr@xmath5 took place 10002000 yr before the sn explosion .",
    "the wr wind accelerated this shell up to velocity of 3050 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the minimum density in the cs shell predicted by our models is @xmath191 @xmath48 (   [ sec - ha ] ) .",
    "this value should reflect the pressure and thermal balance at the latest phase of the interaction of the wr wind with the cs shell .",
    "the dynamical pressure created by the wr wind is @xmath250 for the parameters adopted above ( @xmath226 yr@xmath5 , @xmath251 km s@xmath5 , @xmath252 cm ) this expression leads to @xmath253 dyn @xmath100 . because @xmath254 is actually determined by the pressure at the wr wind termination shock , the pressure could be a factor @xmath255 higher than this estimate if the wind bubble is contained within the shell . however , if the bubble can break out of the shell because of instabilities , the pressure is reduced .",
    "we regard this pressure estimate as a lower limit . to derive the density from pressure equilibrium one needs to know the temperature of the compressed cs gas .",
    "first , we check that the cs shell was mostly neutral .    the ionizing radiation of the presupernova forms a low density hii zone .",
    "the density of the hii zone in pressure equilibrium is @xmath256 @xmath48 assuming @xmath257 k. the column density of the hii zone is @xmath258 where @xmath259 is the luminosity of the ionizing radiation , @xmath0 is the hydrogen recombination coefficient , and ry is the hydrogen ionization potential .",
    "the luminosity of the progenitor , assuming a helium core of a @xmath260 star , is @xmath261 erg s@xmath5 @xcite . adopting @xmath262 erg s@xmath5 , @xmath257 k , @xmath263 @xmath264 s@xmath5 , and @xmath252 cm , we obtain @xmath265 @xmath100 .",
    "this is substantially lower than the hydrogen column density of the cs shell , @xmath266 @xmath100 for a cs shell with a mass of @xmath267 .",
    "this estimate implies that the presupernova radiation ionizes only a small fraction of the cs shell and the bulk of the cs shell is neutral and can be referred to as a photodissociation region @xcite .",
    "the cool neutral cs shell with a column density of @xmath268 @xmath100 is characterized by a dust extinction @xmath269 , assuming interstellar dust properties @xcite . in a photodissociation zone with dust extinction",
    "@xmath270 the gas temperature follows the dust temperature owing to the gas heating by the dust ir radiation @xcite . with the emission efficiency of the dust at the maximum of the blackbody infrared emission @xmath271 (",
    "here @xmath90 is the grain radius ) , the temperature of the dust grains should be @xmath272 . with @xmath261 erg s@xmath5 , @xmath252 cm and @xmath273 cm",
    ", we obtain @xmath274 k. gas with this temperature in equilibrium with the pressure @xmath254 has a density @xmath275 @xmath48 .",
    "this is consistent with the lower limit for the density of cs shell clouds",
    ". the suggested scenario of the cs shell formation thus seems realistic .",
    "our goal was to propose a model for the strong late time x - ray , radio , and h@xmath0  emission from the type ib / c supernova sn  2001em .",
    "we developed a picture in which the sn ejecta of a normal sn  ib / c collide with a dense massive cs shell ( @xmath276 ) at a radius of @xmath277 cm .",
    "we found that two scenarios are viable : model a in which the dense cs shell not is yet overtaken by the time of x - ray observation ( 937 d ) and model b with the cs shell overtaken prior to the x - ray observation .",
    "the mass loss episode that led to the formation of the cs shell was characterized by a high mass loss rate @xmath249 yr@xmath5 at a stage 10002000 yr prior to the sn outburst .",
    "this material was then swept up by the fast wr wind from the presupernova progenitor .",
    "rayleigh - taylor instabilities likely led to the fragmentation of the cs shell which is manifested in the low x - ray and radio absorption despite the high column density of the shell .",
    "the mechanism for the rapid loss of the @xmath278 hydrogen envelope is not clear , although it is probably related to mechanisms for producing sn  ib / c presupernovae in a close binary scenario .",
    "the bulk of sn  ib / c presupernovae are thought to originate by the stripping of the hydrogen envelope at a late stage of binary star evolution as a result of mass transfer to a companion and/or the loss of the common envelope @xcite . in the case of sn  2001em",
    ", we believe that common envelope evolution is the most likely mechanism of the formation of the massive cs shell .",
    "the @xmath279 yr delay between a strong mass loss episode and the supernova explosion indicates that the former might happen at the stage of carbon burning in the core of a star with an initial mass in the range @xmath280 @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the remains of the hydrogen envelope ( @xmath281 ) were lost during the carbon burning phase due to the formation of a common envelope in a binary system .",
    "the relative fraction of sne  ib / c passing through the common envelope phase is uncertain and lies between 10% @xcite and nearly 100% @xcite .",
    "the massive star acquires a red supergiant structure at the he burning stage .",
    "therefore , most sn  ib / c presupernovae pass through the common envelope stage long before ( @xmath209 yr ) the supernova explodes in the rarefied cs environment formed by the wr wind .",
    "only a small fraction of sn  ib / c presupernovae lose their h envelope at the c burning stage .",
    "it was argued that this fraction is possibly about @xmath282 @xcite .",
    "we thus expect that roughly @xmath283 of all sne  ib / c possess close ( @xmath284 cm ) massive cs shells and display cs interaction by strong radio , optical and x - ray emission at an age of @xmath285 yr .",
    "upper limits on late radio emission from sne  ib / c @xcite seem to be consistent with the estimated fraction of these events .",
    "the occurrence of the supernova close to the time that the h envelope was lost may have relevance to some type iin supernovae with strong circumstellar interaction .",
    "@xcite found that the ejecta in sn 1995n inside the reverse shock wave were heavy element rich , implying that this type iin supernova had lost essentially all the hydrogen envelope in a dense wind at the time of the supernova .",
    "it is unlikely , however , that the rate of all the type iin supernovae can be explained entirely by the common envelope events at the carbon burning phase @xcite .",
    "in addition to radio detection , an efficient way to find sne  ib / c with close cs shells could be the detection of late time h@xmath0  emission with a luminosity of @xmath286 erg s@xmath5 at an age of @xmath285 yr , as has occurred for some type iin supernovae .",
    "another interesting way to detect the presence of the massive close cs shell around sn  ib / c is related to the possibility that the shell is dusty .",
    "if the radius of the cs shell exceeds the dust evaporation radius @xmath287 cm , the observations of the infrared echo in the @xmath288 bands may reveal the presence of a cs shell soon after the sn  ib / c explosion , similar to infrared dust echos observed from sn  1979c and sn  1980k @xcite .",
    "these observations will also serve to distinguish late circumstellar interaction from misaligned gamma ray burst events , which must be present in the population of sne ib / c at some level .",
