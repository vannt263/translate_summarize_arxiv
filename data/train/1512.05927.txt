    "the understanding of the the stefan - boltzmann law is one of the most celebrated landmarks of modern physics . in order to derive it",
    "an important aspect is the speed at which energy leaves the blackbody cavity .",
    "if one considers the electromagnetic radiation composed of massless photons , the speed they leave the cavity is taken to be the speed of light c , leading to a formula for the radiance as being proportional to the energy density times @xmath1 , i.e. , the familiar stefan - boltzmann law @xcite .",
    "the present work addresses this issue for a gas of massive photons .",
    "formulas for the mean speed @xmath2 and the radiance @xmath3 are determined for arbitrary mass of the photon and at all temperatures .",
    "the corresponding high temperature ( or small mass ) and low temperature ( or large mass ) regimes are discussed .",
    "it should be noted that the stefan - boltzmann law for massive photons was considered previously in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , the calculations were spoiled by the incorrect assumption that the massive photon s speed is @xmath1 .",
    "as is well known there are two equivalent ways to arrive at the thermodynamics of radiation at temperature @xmath4 in a cavity of volume @xmath5 .",
    "one is to consider an ensemble of quantum harmonic oscillators , and another that treats hot radiation as a bose gas of relativistic particles with vanishing chemical potential @xcite . according to the latter approach the distribution function",
    "is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the energy of the photon of momentum @xmath9 ( note that @xmath10 ) .",
    "now , assuming that the photon has mass @xmath11 the expression for @xmath12 is replaced by @xmath13 in fact , the factor 2 in eq .",
    "( [ distribution ] ) should be replaced by 3 taking into account an additional degree of freedom associated with a nonvanishing @xmath11 ; however it will be assumed that such a degree of freedom can be ignored in the thermal equilibrium of radiation and matter ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the number of photons @xmath14 in the cavity is obtained by integrating eq .",
    "( [ distribution ] ) over the phase space of one photon , @xmath15 where spherical coordinates have been used in the last equality . with the help of the geometric series and noting eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ number ] ) can be recast as @xmath16 where one identifies an integral representation of the modified bessel function of the second kind @xmath17 , resulting in @xmath18 as a simple check , considering that for very small arguments @xmath17 behaves approximately as @xmath19 , by setting @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ number2 ] ) it follows @xmath21 which is a familiar expression of blackbody radiation .",
    "the speed of the photon @xmath22 and its momentum are related by @xmath23 , leading to ( below @xmath24 ) @xmath25 clearly showing that @xmath26 only if the photon is massless . the mean value of @xmath27 can be obtained by averaging over the phase space with eq .",
    "( [ distribution ] ) , i.e. , @xmath28 where the first expression in eq .",
    "( [ speed ] ) has been used .",
    "now , following along the same steps that led from eq .",
    "( [ number ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ number2 ] ) and using the formula for @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ number2 ] ) , one finds , @xmath29 \\left[x^2\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } n^{-1}k_{2}(nx)\\right]^{-1 } , \\label{photonspeed}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the polylogarithm function [ note that @xmath31 . by taking @xmath20 [ i.e. , @xmath32 , cf .",
    "( [ number2 ] ) ] in eq .",
    "( [ photonspeed ] ) it results @xmath33 for all values of @xmath4 . however , if @xmath11 is strictly nonvanishing , when @xmath34 ( i.e. , at low temperatures ) , eq .",
    "( [ photonspeed ] ) yields the following asymptotic behavior [ recall that @xmath35 behaves approximately as @xmath36 for large arguments ] , @xmath37 which is the mean speed of a molecule of an ordinary nonrelativistic gas ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . thus ,",
    "as @xmath4 approaches the absolute zero , the massive photons disappear from the cavity [ cf .",
    "( [ number2 ] ) ] , and in doing so they come to rest . the plot in fig .",
    "[ pressaobessel ] illustrates these facts .",
    "as @xmath14 in eq . ( [ number ] ) , the internal energy @xmath38 can also be obtained by using eq .",
    "( [ distribution ] ) , @xmath39 in order to make contact with the corresponding planckian formula , it is convenient to consider @xmath40 and to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ uenergy ] ) , noticing eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) , resulting in @xmath41 where @xmath42 by setting @xmath43 in eqs .",
    "( [ massivephoton ] ) and ( [ planck ] ) the planckian result emerges as expected .",
    "[ it should be remarked that an expression for @xmath38 as that for @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ number2 ] ) is also available but it will not be needed here . ]    the energy density @xmath44 as given by eqs .",
    "( [ massivephoton ] ) and ( [ planck ] ) is in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite . according to ref .",
    "@xcite the radiance @xmath3 ( which is defined as the amount of energy radiated per second per unit of area of an opening on the wall of the cavity ) is related to the energy density as , @xmath45 in the following it will be shown that eq .",
    "( [ toresult ] ) is incorrect if the photon has a nonvanishing mass .",
    "consider a small opening on the wall of the cavity .",
    "the power radiated per unity of area can be obtained by calculating the flux of @xmath46 through the surface of the opening ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) taking into account all possible values of @xmath40 and all possible directions of flight starting from inside the cavity : @xmath47 with @xmath27 and @xmath48 given in eqs .",
    "( [ speed ] ) and ( [ planck ] ) .",
    "it should be noticed that @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ radiance ] ) came about by solving @xmath50 where the integration considers only one hemisphere and @xmath51 is the angle between the straight line normal to the opening and the straight line associated with photon s flight out of the cavity .",
    "clearly , eq . ( [ toresult ] ) follows from eq .",
    "( [ radiance ] ) only for massless photons [ cf .",
    "( [ speed ] ) and ( [ massivephoton ] ) ] .    in a manner similar to that which led to eq .",

    "( [ corrections ] ) as the stefan - boltzmann law of blackbody radiation .",
    "now , noticing eq .",
    "( [ poly ] ) , for a nonvanishing mass and at very low temperatures eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) yields @xmath55 showing that @xmath3 fades away much more quickly than its massless counterpart in the stefan - boltzmann law as the absolute zero of temperature is approached .",
    "before closing , it should be pointed out that the second term in the expression for @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ corrections ] ) is twice that in ref .",
    "@xcite and therefore the amendments proposed above do not improve much the possibility of measuring the mass of the photon by considering the deviation from the stefan - boltzmann law in eq .",
    "( [ corrections ] ) @xcite . however , by progressively lowering the temperature , at some point the radiance @xmath3 for massive photons in eq . ( [ r ] )",
    "will differ radically from the stefan - boltzmann law [ cf .",
    "( [ corrections2 ] ) ] .",
    "a word of caution is due regarding this remark though . in the context of quantum field theory at finite temperature",
    ", one learns that the use of the distribution in eq .",
    "( [ distribution ] ) to address radiation in a cavity of finite volume is not always a reliable approach .",
    "rougly speaking , if the smallest dimension @xmath56 of the cavity is such that @xmath57 is not big enough ( ideally infinite ) , quantum vacuum can not be ignored , and it will play a role , resulting that eq .",
