    "<S> this equation may possess three typical solutions depending on a dissipative parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> nonlinear dynamics may be a topic of interest in various fields of science and engineering . </S>",
    "<S> a lot of problems arising in science and engineering may be modelled as a dynamical system . as an illustration </S>",
    "<S> , there is the van der pol equation @xcite given by @xmath0 found in nonlinear circuit theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath1 is a physical observable depending on the time @xmath2 ; @xmath3 and @xmath4 are constants . </S>",
    "<S> there is also the van der pol - duffing equation @xcite given by @xmath5 which may model the optical bistability in a dispersive medium @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the additional quantity @xmath6 is a cubic parameter .    besides </S>",
    "<S> , nonlinear phenomena may be also described by nonlinear partial differential ( nlpd ) equations such as the well - known vakhnenko equation @xcite given by @xmath7 arising in relaxing media as a model equation of propagation of high - frequency perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> subscripts denote partial differentiation with respect to time @xmath2 and space @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> equation has been subject to many investigations ( @xcite and references therein ) in recent years . </S>",
    "<S> one typical class of solutions to nlpd equations are the so - called solitons arising as the result of balance between nonlinear and dispersion effects . </S>",
    "<S> higher order solitons may be also found in higher order nlpd equations . </S>",
    "<S> one important question that may be pointed out is whether higher order solitons may survive in higher order vakhnenko equation @xcite .    in the present letter </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a barotropic medium @xmath9 under relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> the quantities @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote pressure and mass density , respectively , and @xmath12 is an additional parameter . </S>",
    "<S> then , we derive a novel ( 1 + 1)-dimensional nle model equation . we discuss the different soliton solutions to this ( 1 + 1)-dimensional nle equation .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , vakhnenko @xcite has derived a dynamic state equation using an expansion of the specific volume @xmath13 as power series of the small perturbations @xmath14 with accuracy @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath16 is the pressure related to the unperturbed state . performing this expansion to accuracy @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> , the following dynamic state equation may be found @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the relaxation time , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 may stand for velocities of the relaxation processes defined as @xmath23 . for high - frequency perturbations , that is @xmath24 and @xmath25 and for low - frequency perturbations , that is @xmath26 and @xmath27 . following the ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , equation may be analyzed by means of the multiscale method @xcite by introducing a small parameter @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the frequency of the wave perturbation .    using a dispersion relation of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 for the linearized equation , in the case of low - frequency perturbations , that is @xmath32 , a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional nle equation may be derived as follows @xmath33 with @xmath34 the nonlinear terms have been reconstructed in agreement with the initial equation . </S>",
    "<S> this equation may be viewed as a modified korteweg - de vries - burgers ( mkdvb ) equation . </S>",
    "<S> recently , fu et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have studied the specific case @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( mkdv equation ) by constructing breather lattice solutions . </S>",
    "<S> similar procedure may be discussed for equation in order to find out other kind of breather lattice solutions . </S>",
    "<S> we may actually think that equation may deserve further interests from the viewpoint of investigation of propagation of localized and periodic waves .    in the case of high - frequency perturbations , that is @xmath37 , performing the dispersion relation to @xmath38 , in agreement with the initial equation , one may get the following ( 1 + 1)-dimensional nle equation @xmath39 where @xmath40 standing for dissipative and dispersive parameters . in order to investigate the equation </S>",
    "<S> , it seems useful to consider the following accuracy @xmath41 we consider two interesting cases : @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> first case : @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> + equation may be reduced to @xmath44 up to the following transformations @xmath45 without dissipative @xmath46-term , equation may be observed as the sch@xmath47fer - wayne short pulse ( swsp ) equation @xcite which has been subject to many recent investigations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this swsp equation may have a variant form given by @xmath48 up to the transformations @xmath8@xmath49@xmath50 , @xmath51@xmath49@xmath52 , @xmath2@xmath49@xmath53 and @xmath1@xmath49@xmath54 , @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> further interests ought to be paid to equation which may have many applications in soliton theory and nonlinear optics . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , its extension to a complex - valued swsp equation @xcite with dissipative @xmath46-terms may be worth investigating alongside the effect of the dissipative parameter @xmath46 on the different solutions . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , extending @xmath1 to a complex - valued quantity @xmath55 @xcite in order to get the following equation @xmath56 equation may be transformed into the following system @xmath57 up to the following transformations @xmath58 where @xmath3 is an arbitrary constant , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> looking for soliton solutions with the boundary conditions @xmath61 , @xmath62 as @xmath63 , equation may be bilinearized as in ref @xcite according to the hirota s method @xcite , and soliton solutions to equation may be easily derived . </S>",
    "<S> thus , deriving the dispersion relation which may obviously be expressed in terms of the dissipative parameter @xmath46 , it is then possible to discuss the soliton solutions of equation with respect to @xmath46 . as a result , a soliton solution @xmath55 may be given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 being a contant parameter , and @xmath67 the physical complex - valued quantities @xmath68 and @xmath29 standing for wave number and angular frequency , respectively , may satisfy the following dispersion equation @xmath69 from which @xmath68 and @xmath29 may be expressed in terms of the dissipative parameter @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , discussing the soliton solutions expressed in terms of @xmath70 and @xmath71 vs @xmath51 , one may expect to find loop- , cusp- and hump- shaped solitons . </S>",
    "<S> for some convenience , we do not go further with these developments . </S>",
    "<S> we shall focus our attention to a further novel equation below that may be also of great interests . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> second case : @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> + equation may be reduced to @xmath72 up to the following transformations @xmath73 without the dissipative term and @xmath74-term , equation may be reduced to the well - known vakhnenko equation @xcite . without the dissipative term and @xmath75-term </S>",
    "<S> , equation may be reduced to . performing variable transformations , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce new independent variables @xmath76 and @xmath77 as follows @xmath78 where @xmath79 is an arbitrary constant . </S>",
    "<S> then , equation is reduced to @xmath80 where @xmath81 defining another independent variables @xmath82 and @xmath19 as follows @xmath83 equation is transformed to @xmath84 moreover , using the ansatz @xmath85 we get the following coupled equations @xmath86 this system may be closely related to that described by kakuhata and konno @xcite while investigating the loop soliton solutions of string interacting with external field . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the other physical meaning of equation is pointed out . </S>",
    "<S> this may be useful in constructing the soliton solutions to equation . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in order to find a soliton solution , we consider the following boundary conditions @xmath87 we may consider the following settings @xcite @xmath88 equation is then bilinearized as follows @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 denote hirota operators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> expanding @xmath92 and @xmath93 in a suitable formal power series , a soliton solution to equation is given by @xmath94,\\quad z=\\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma+\\tau)-2(\\omega+k)\\left[\\tanh(\\theta)+1\\right].\\label{eq23 }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 , @xmath96 being an arbitrary constant . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion relation is given by + [ fig1a ] [ fig1b ] +   +   + + @xmath97 + which may lead to the following solution ( @xmath98 ) @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the velocity of the wave satisfying the condition @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> it seems worth noting here that from equations , and , one may find that @xmath102 , @xmath103 being an arbitrary constant . in order to discuss the soliton solutions to equation , it is important to consider the following relation @xmath104\\partial_{z}.\\label{eq26 }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we may pay interest to the shape of the soliton @xmath1 and its momentum @xmath105 . as a result , it comes that * for @xmath106 , @xmath107 may never change sign but may be infinite at some singular point , whereas @xmath108 may change sign once and may be infinite at the same singular point . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath1 may be monotone but may have an infinite derivative at this particular point , and @xmath109 may have a cusp - like shape ( see panels [ fig](a ) and [ fig](b ) ) ; * for @xmath110 , @xmath107 may change sign twice and may be infinite at two singular points , whereas @xmath108 may change sign three times . thus , @xmath1 may follow a multi - valued shape with two singular points at their derivatives and @xmath109 may have a multi - valued profile especially a loop - like shape ( see panels [ fig](c ) and [ fig](d ) ) ; * finally , for @xmath111v\\frac{\\sqrt{1+v}}{1-v},\\infty\\right[$ ] , @xmath107 may never change sign and may never take infinite values . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath108 may change sign once and may always be finite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath1 may have a kink - like shape , whilst @xmath109 may have a single - valued profile especially a hump - like shape ( see panels [ fig](e ) and [ fig](f ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> + we give some illustrations of the previous discussions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we may take a velocity @xmath112 to plot the different profiles . </S>",
    "<S> the aforementioned shapes are clearly depicted in , at initial time @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , for the cusp - shape , the dissipative parameter is given by @xmath114 .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , the studies of the novel ( 1 + 1)-dimensional nle equation including the vakhnenko and the variant swsp equations and , respectively , may have some scientific interests both from the viewpoint of the investigation of the propagation of high - frequency perturbations and from the viewpoint of the existence of stable wave formations . </S>",
    "<S> thus , applications may be found in soliton theory , geodynamics , hydrodynamics and nonlinear optics , just to name a few . </S>"
