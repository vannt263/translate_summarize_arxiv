    "fully differential qcd cross sections are important observables for studies at high - energy colliders . by allowing detector - specific acceptance cuts on phase space variables they eliminate the need for extrapolation into unmeasured , and often also poorly calculable regions , and thereby improve theory - experiment comparisons .",
    "reliable theoretical predictions for such differential cross sections require the inclusion of at least next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections .",
    "nlo calculations combine virtual one - loop corrections with the real emission contributions from unresolved partons .",
    "these two parts are usually computed separately and each is infrared divergent , only their sum is infrared finite .",
    "nlo monte - carlo programs incorporate both pieces and allow the simultaneous computation of many differential cross sections for the particular reaction considered .",
    "however , these programs require that infrared singularities be eliminated before any numerical integration can be done .",
    "there are essentially two types of methods to effect this cancellation .",
    "the phase space slicing ( pss ) method @xcite is based on approximating the matrix elements and the phase space integration measure in boundary regions of phase space so integration may be carried out analytically . the subtraction method @xcite",
    "is based on adding and subtracting counter terms designed to approximate the real emission amplitudes in the phase space boundary regions on the one hand , and to be integrable with respect to the momentum of an unresolved parton .    for massless partons",
    "both methods are well - developed and have been widely used .",
    "a quite general formulation of phase space slicing has been given in ref .",
    "it was extended to include massive quarks and identified hadrons in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there exist two general formulations of the subtraction method .",
    "one is the residue approach @xcite , the other the dipole formalism @xcite .",
    "both can handle massless partons and identified hadrons in the final and/or initial state .",
    "the extension of the dipole method to handle massive quarks , using dimensional regularization , has been given recently in ref .",
    "an extension to photon radiation off massive fermions , using small masses for infrared regularization , was developed by dittmaier in @xcite .",
    "there are also hybrid methods @xcite that combine elements of the slicing and subtraction methods such that both the resolved and unresolved contributions are numerically small and can be reliably integrated .    with general formulations of the phase space slicing and dipole methods for massless and massive quarks now available , it is interesting to compare their efficiency and accuracy . in this paper",
    "we do this for ( differential ) `` cross sections '' for heavy quark production in the process @xmath5 .",
    "this case is of course very simple but also generic for more complicated processes . in the case of the nlo cross section for @xmath6 production",
    "@xcite it was recently verified @xcite that the slicing method and a somewhat differently phrased dipole method @xcite agreed .",
    "our results using the dipole subtraction method represent the first numerical implementation of some of the subtraction terms computed in @xcite . while the dipole method is exact , the pss method requires the introduction of a theoretical resolution parameter @xmath7 , usually required to be quite small .",
    "we include improvement terms in the pss method @xcite , and study their effect of removing restrictions on the size of the phase space slicing cutoff .",
    "this is especially important for cross sections involving heavy quark production , and allows for a free choice of slicing parameter without reference to the heavy quark mass , a prerequisite for considering the high - energy or zero - mass limit .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we compute the fully differential cross section for @xmath8 using the pss method , including the improvement terms . in section 3",
    "we compute this cross section with the dipole subtraction method . in section 4",
    "we present a numerical comparison of the two methods , followed by our conclusions .",
    "we consider the process @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "the nlo corrections involve virtual corrections to ( [ eq:46 ] ) and the gluon bremsstrahlung reaction @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "we define the invariants @xmath13 the final state phase space for the 3 parton contribution is divided into `` hard '' and `` soft '' regions .",
    "the hard region , in which all 3 final state particles in ( [ eq:46 ] ) are resolved , is defined such that @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "( in an appendix we discuss this definition when more than one color structure is present ) .",
    "the complementary region is soft .",
    "let us review the approximations involved in pss , following @xcite .",
    "the 3 parton contribution to the fully differential decay can be written schematically as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the exact matrix element squared , and @xmath18 denotes the exact 3 particle phase space measure .",
    "note we do not consider the effect of jet - algorithms here ( they are implicit in the definition of the phase space ) .",
    "the slicing of phase space is indicated by the symbol @xmath19 , which is 0 in the hard phase space region and 1 in the soft region .",
    "@xmath20 is given by @xmath21 and represents the integral of the approximate matrix element @xmath22 over the approximate phase space @xmath23 .",
    "the resolution factor @xmath24 is independent of the hard scattering and can be calculated analytically for a wide range of multiparton processes @xcite .",
    "@xmath25 is given by @xmath26 and represents the integral over the exact 3-particle phase space phase space of the difference between the true matrix element and the approximate matrix element .",
    "@xmath27 is given by @xmath28 and represents the difference between the integrals of the approximate matrix element over the true and approximate unresolved phase space .",
    "note that @xmath20 contains the soft and collinear divergences needed to cancel the singularities of the virtual term , while @xmath25 and @xmath27 are finite and vanish as the domain of support for @xmath19 is taken to zero .",
    "the matrix elements for the nlo cross section for process ( [ eq:46 ] ) are not very complicated , so we can be explicit . at lowest order we have @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of colors , @xmath31 the fraction of the elementary charge @xmath32 of the heavy quark , @xmath33 its mass , @xmath34 and @xmath35 note that in nlo approximation @xmath36 in eq .",

    "figure [ vary_smin - fig1]a shows that , for the inclusive cross section , not including all @xmath65 leads to @xmath1 dependence ( in fact the @xmath25 worsens the @xmath1 dependence slightly here ) , but including @xmath25 and @xmath27 relaxes all constraints on this parameter .",
    "this , however , comes at the expense of potentially lower numerical accuracy , particularly for the differential distributions to be considered below .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath27 term in particular requires a larger number of points in the monte carlo integration than using @xmath20 alone , to achieve a given accuracy . in practice , therefore , it is common to use only the @xmath20 in a pss calculation , with an @xmath1 value small enough for the combined @xmath69 contribution to be negligible .",
    "one must however be careful not to choose @xmath1 so small that numerical inaccuracies result from the large opposite sign soft@xmath70virtual and real emission contributions , as illustrated by figure [ vary_smin - fig1]b .    turning to distributions , we show in fig .",
    "[ pperp - fig1 ] the single heavy quark transverse momentum and rapidity distributions at a small value of @xmath71 , computed with @xmath20 only .",

    "in the dipole formalism one subtracts a suitable term from the real emission part and adds it again to the virtual correction after having performed one phase - space integration .",

    "we note that we found similar results when we used ( [ eq:8 ] ) , generating the 4-vectors via a cascade algorithm .",
    "this required using more random number points in order to achieve the same accuracy .",
    "the pss method is relatively easy to implement , with little analytical calculation , at the expense of requiring cancellations between large numbers ( for small @xmath7 ) or having multiple negative contributions ( for large @xmath7 when including @xmath20 , @xmath25 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "since the dipole method requires more analytical preparation work to be implemented , we expect it to show better numerical integration in the monte carlo program .",
    "we will see that this expectation is borne out by our results .",

    ", we perform separate runs for the @xmath80 2-particle and @xmath80 3-particle contributions , and combine them for each iteration , leading to 15 results @xmath81 .",

    "we note that the pss method suffers further penalties in accuracy and efficiency if the value of @xmath7 is chosen so large that the @xmath25 and @xmath27 become necessary ; in particular the @xmath27 contribution requires generating the soft phase space measure , and involves the difference of two phase space measures which are very similar in magnitude for small values of the soft invariants , cf .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we see that the dipole method reaches a given accuracy with less iterations .",
    "next we compare the efficiency of these methods to compute transverse momentum and rapidity distributions .    as before , the first 5 of 20 iterations",
    "are used solely for grid - setting , with @xmath85 points per iteration .",
    "the values and their errors for each bin are computed according to ( [ eq:7 ] ) .",
    "we see that the dipole methods produces somewhat smaller errors , with slightly less bin to bin variations .",
    "when we increased the number of points , we saw that both methods perform not too differently .",
    "we also noticed that this loss of superiority is progressive with the number of bins .",
    "this suggests that parts of the positive and negative contributions end up in different bins .",
    "to test this idea , we performed a simple smearing where each event with weight @xmath86 that would normally end up in bin @xmath87 is distributed in bins @xmath88 , each with weight @xmath89 .",
    "we found that this smearing indeed reduced the errors somewhat , but in about equal measure for both methods .    finally , we compared the accuracies of the methods in the large @xmath90 limit for the inclusive cross section , where the heavy quarks become effectively massless .",
    "for the pss method we investigated how to choose @xmath7 in order to minimize the calculation error .",
    "we found that @xmath7 is best chosen not too small ( which would lead to large numerical cancellations ) , and as a fraction of @xmath90 between 0.01 and 0.1 . for large @xmath7 this may require the inclusion of the @xmath25 and @xmath27 terms , which contribute about 10% to the cross section for @xmath91 at @xmath92 gev@xmath67 .",
    "for @xmath92 gev@xmath67 and @xmath93 their contribution is only 2% , with a slightly larger total error for the same number of points .",
    "we found similar results keeping @xmath90 fixed and letting @xmath33 become smaller .",
    "for the dipole method we found that it has consistently better accuracy than the pss method in these limits . in general in the high - energy limit ,",
    "both these methods lead to cancellations between contributions with @xmath94 and @xmath95 terms , which is not advantageous numerically . therefore",
    "a method which avoids such logarithms could be desirable @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have compared the accuracy and efficiency of two general - purpose methods to compute nlo heavy quark production cross sections , for a very simple case .",
    "we found the dipole method @xcite , while involving additional analytical work , to be superior in efficiency and accuracy .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by dittmaier @xcite who compared his method with a slicing calculation for a number of electroweak cross sections .",
    "the phase space slicing method @xcite , which is easy to use and minimizes analytical work , can be extended @xcite to become fully independent of the slicing parameter , which we demonstrated in this paper for the reaction at hand .",
    "although our case - study involves only the simplest of heavy quark production processes , it is , we believe a useful first step toward gaining numerical experience with general methods for constructing nlo monte carlo programs for heavy quark production .",
    "moreover , such experience gained at nlo is likely to be very valuable when these methods are generalized for nnlo cross sections .      the work of t.o.e . , e.l . and l.p .",
    "is supported by the foundation for fundamental research of matter ( fom ) and the national organization for scientific research ( nwo ) .",
    "in this appendix we mention a subtlety in implementing pss , which is well known to experts in the field , but not readily found in the literature .",
    "it does not come into play for our simple case study , but does for amplitudes in which more than one color structure is present .",
    "the correct implementation of phase space slicing requires that the real emission amplitude be decomposed into pieces with a unique singularity structure and that the slicing procedure be defined for each piece separately .",
    "we discuss the point for a simplified example , where we take al particles to be massless .",
    "we assume that the real emission amplitude is given by | m_4 |^2 & = & + .",
    "this simple example has the singularity structure for the leading - color part of the @xmath96 amplitude .",
    "the correct way to implement phase space slicing treats each singularity structure separately and the resolved contribution from the real emission amplitude reads therefore & & d_4 ( s_13 - s_min ) ( s_34 - s_min ) ( s_24 - s_min ) + & & + d_4 ( s_14 - s_min ) ( s_34 - s_min ) ( s_23 - s_min ) .",
    "the incorrect method cuts out all possible singularities from the amplitude and uses the expression & & d_4 ( + ) ( s_13 - s_min ) ( s_34 - s_min ) ( s_24 - s_min ) + & & ( s_14 - s_min ) ( s_23 - s_min ) for the resolved contribution .",
    "the difference between the correct implementation and the incorrect one consists of terms of the form d_4 ( s_13 - s_min ) ( s_34 - s_min ) ( s_24 - s_min ) ( s_min - s_14 ) ( s_23 - s_14 ) together with three similar terms , obtained by exchanging @xmath97 in the matrix element and the slicing procedure .",
    "contrary to naive expectations , these terms do not vanish in the limit @xmath98 , but give a constant contribution .",
