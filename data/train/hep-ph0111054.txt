    "the usual parton @xmath4 distribution functions @xmath5 of a hadron @xmath6 , which are extracted from deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) for a space - like energy scale @xmath7 , have counterparts in the time - like region @xmath8 , which are the hadron fragmentation functions @xmath9 .",
    "they represent the probability to find the hadron @xmath6 with a fraction @xmath10 of the momentum of the parent parton @xmath11 , at a given value of @xmath12 . like distribution functions ,",
    "fragmentation functions are _ universal _ , that is process - independent , and likewise , their @xmath12 dependence is fully predicted by the qcd evolution equations .",
    "they can be measured in various high energy collision processes namely , @xmath13 annihilation , @xmath14 , semi - inclusive dis , @xmath15 and single - inclusive @xmath16 collisions , @xmath17 .",
    "so far , the best known fragmentation funtions are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , corresponding to the most copiously produced light mesons @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "our purpose here is to consider the hyperon fragmentation functions and more specifically to examine the case of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the self - analyzing properties of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) make this spin - half baryon particularly appealing , to study spin transfer mechanisms .",
    "we first recall the results of a qcd analysis of the data for inclusive ( @xmath22 ) production in @xmath13 collisions , which yields the first simple and reliable parametrization of the unpolarized fragmentation functions @xmath23 .",
    "the observed longitudinal polarization of the @xmath0 s produced at lep on the @xmath24-resonance , leads to some inaccurate information on the spin - dependent fragmentation functions @xmath25 .",
    "as we will see , several theoretical models have been proposed for these polarized fragmentation functions which are , so far , badly constrained by existing data .",
    "some predictions can be made for the spin transfer in polarized dis , but one gets no definite conclusion by comparing them with the present very poor data from hermes at desy and e665 at fnal .",
    "we also stress the importance of the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) production in neutrino ( antineutrino ) dis , which allows a clean flavor and spin separation .",
    "we will show some new data from nomad at cern and comment on future experimental possibilities .",
    "+ we will also give the prospects from @xmath16 collisions with polarized protons at rhic - bnl , because there are recent interesting suggestions for measuring the helicity ( and transversity ) transfer asymmetry in the process @xmath26 .",
    "from its dependence on the rapidity of the @xmath0 , it is possible to discriminate easily between the various theoretical models , thanks to the high luminosity and the small statistical errors . of course , this can be easely extended to the production of the other hyperons ( @xmath3 ) , which will be also briefly discussed .",
    "from the production of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) in @xmath13 annihilation one can determine @xmath27 by using a standard parametrization , at initial scale @xmath28 @xmath29 to reduce the number of free parameters occuring above , one must make some simplifying assumptions based on , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath30 arguments .",
    "_ ten _ free parameters , needed to include light quarks , heavy quarks and gluons , were obtained by fitting the world data for 14gev@xmath3191.2gev , in a leading and next - to - leading order ( lo and nlo ) qcd analysis @xcite . although , it leads to a good determination of @xmath32 , there is no flavor separation for the dominant contributions @xmath33 and no separation between @xmath34 and @xmath35 , since the data does not separate @xmath0 and ( @xmath1 ) . other sets of quark fragmentation functions into @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , based on a bag model calculation and a fit to @xmath13 data , have been published recently @xcite .    the fragmentation of a longitudinally polarized parton into a longitudinally polarized @xmath0 will be described in terms of @xmath36 where @xmath37 [ @xmath38 is the probability to find a @xmath0 with positive [ negative ] helicity in a parton @xmath11 with positive helicity .",
    "clearly one obtains the unpolarized fragmentation function @xmath32 by taking in ( 2 ) , the sum instead of the difference . for the fragmentation of a transversely polarized parton into a transversely polarized @xmath0 ,",
    "one uses ( 2 ) to define @xmath39 in complete analogy with @xmath25 .    in order to construct @xmath40 ,",
    "one usually makes the assumption @xmath41 at a given scale , where @xmath42 are the spin transfer coefficients , for which several models can be found in the literature . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "@xmath40 was neglected for heavy quarks and gluon and they take the following simple parametrization @xmath43 in terms of _ two _ new parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 at a given scale . to cover a wide range of plausible models , they consider three different scenarios : + 1 ) in the non - relativistic quark model ,",
    "only strange quarks can contribute , therefore @xmath46 .",
    "+ 2 ) by transposing the estimate of ref.@xcite for the polarized @xmath47 and @xmath48 quark distributions in a @xmath0 , to the polarized fragmentation functions , one gets @xmath49 .",
    "+ 3 ) by assuming that all polarized fragmentation functions are equal , which is an extreme case , one gets @xmath50 . + in ref.@xcite , only two scenarios similar to 1 ) and 2 ) , were considered and for other alternatives along the same lines , see also ref.@xcite . a different way to construct @xmath51",
    "was proposed in ref.@xcite , based on our knowledge of the quark distributions and by means of the simple reciprocity relation , the so called gribov - lipatov relation @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the quark distribution for finding the quark @xmath54 carrying a momentum fraction @xmath55 inside the hadron @xmath6 .",
    "+ the longitudinal @xmath0 polarization @xmath56 , which can be directly expressed in terms of the @xmath57 ( see ref.@xcite ) , has been measured at lep by several experiments and is shown in fig.1 .",
    "it is large and negative and consistent with the su(6 ) quark - diquark model proposed in ref.@xcite , as well as scenario 3 ) from ref.@xcite , mentioned above . in a very recent work @xcite ,",
    "one finds various predictions for @xmath58 , where @xmath59 stands for any hyperon of the octet baryon , obtained by using su(3 ) symmetry relations .",
    "these results can be used to make predictions for @xmath0 production in semi - inclusive dis , with only the electron ( muon ) beam longitudinally polarized .",
    "the @xmath0 polarization @xmath56 along its own momentum is related (  for the exact expression see ref.@xcite ) to the longitudinal spin transfer @xmath60 defined as @xmath61 from the above values of @xmath45 , one anticipates that @xmath62 will be small for 1 ) , negative for 2 ) and large and positive for 3 ) and the results can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "another set of predictions is given in ref.@xcite and it will be interesting to compare them with data from future polarized dis experiments , in particular from hermes at desy and compass at cern .    for the time being , we only have the few data points displayed in fig.2 for the spin transfer for @xmath0 production and in fig.3 for @xmath1 production .",
    "the three curves represent the predictions from three possible scenarios proposed in ref.@xcite in the framework of the pqcd based model and the use of the reciprocity relation eq.(5 ) .",
    "the dotted curves correspond to pure valence quark contributions and for the dashed curves one has introduced a symmetric quark - antiquark sea , whereas it is asymmetric for the solid curves .",
    "although this last case seems slightly favored , the simultaneous description of @xmath0 and @xmath1 spin transfers remains hard to achieve and therefore more accurate data are badly needed ( for a detailed discussion on this point , see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the main observation is based on the fact that neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) can be regarded as a purely polarized lepton beam since neutrinos are left - handed ( antineutrinos are right - handed )",
    ". therefore they only interact with quarks of specific helicities and flavors .",
    "the scattering of a neutrino ( antineutrino ) beam on a hadronic target provides _ a source of polarized quarks with specific flavor_. this important property makes neutrino ( antineutrino ) dis , an ideal laboratory to study the flavor dependence of quark fragmentation .",
    "+ if one measures , @xmath0 and @xmath1 production in neutrino and antineutrino dis , one can show @xcite that the four longitudinal polarizations @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be expressed in terms of four fragmentation functions , allowing a clean separation between quarks and antiquarks . in fig.4",
    "we show the nomad data for @xmath63 , compared with some model calculations from ref.@xcite , as well as the predictions for the remaining three processes .",
    "again more data are requiered to test these models but fortunately , one can expect future experimental possibilities from charged currents @xmath67 dis , with hera at desy , cebaf at jefferson lab . and erhic at bnl .",
    "let us now move to another area where we can test these polarized fragmentation functions , by studying the spin transfer parameters in @xmath16 collisions . a new polarized @xmath16 collider at rhic - bnl , which starts operating now , will allow to undertake a vast spin physics programme at high center - of - mass energies , up to @xmath68 = 500gev .",
    "first , we are interested in the reaction @xmath69 , where both the initial proton and the produced @xmath0 are longitudinaly polarized and we consider the helicity transfer parameter @xmath70 defined as follows @xmath71    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the rapidity and the transverse momentum of the outgoing @xmath0 . @xmath74 [ @xmath75 denotes the cross section where the proton and the @xmath0 helicities have the same [ opposite ] sign .",
    "when @xmath72 is positive the @xmath0 has the direction of @xmath76 and @xmath73 is always assumed to be large .",
    "@xmath70 is directly related to the @xmath57 , whose exact expression can be found in ref.@xcite , and therefore it is possible to make predictions , which are shown in fig.5 .",
    "again one can see that the sign and magnitude of @xmath70 are strongly correlated to the values of @xmath45 and given the smallness of the expected statistical errors , indicated in the figure along the horizontal axis , it will be now rather easy to pin down the right underlying mechanism .",
    "+ one notices that in all cases @xmath70 is small for negative rapidity .",
    "this is due to the fact that the dominant subprocess is @xmath77 and we have assumed that @xmath78 . this feature is rather general and it was discussed in more details in ref.@xcite .",
    "it characterizes also other helicity transfers as shown in fig.6 , where we display the predicted helicity transfers for all the hyperons @xmath79 , resulting from two models of the fragmentation functions .",
    "finally , we can also consider the case where both the proton and the @xmath0 are transversely polarized and the corresponding spin transfer parameter @xmath80 , is defined as in eq.(7 ) , where helicity is replaced by transverse polarization .",
    "this spin observable is related to the quark transversity distributions , so called @xmath81 and to the transversity fragmentation functions @xmath39 mentioned in section 2 .",
    "needless to say that we have no experimental information on these quantities .",
    "however we can derive some bounds on @xmath80 , using positivity arguments .",
    "we recall that positivity leads to the inequality @xcite @xmath82 whose validity has been established up to nlo qcd corrections .",
    "a similar constraint holds for hadron fragmentation functions @xcite , namely @xmath83 by saturating the above inequalities , we get an estimate for an upper and lower bounds for @xmath80 which are displayed in fig.7 .",
    "the larger allowed region corresponds to scenario 3 ) , mentioned earlier , due to the value of @xmath45 and from the expected statistical accuracy , we get rather small error bars .",
    "+ to summarize , we have now some knowledge of the unpolarized fragmentation functions @xmath84 , but we miss a better flavor separation , which can be properly achieved by means of neutrino ( antineutrino ) dis or charged currents in @xmath67 dis .",
    "the corresponding polarized fragmentation functions @xmath85 are poorly known and more data is needed for testing several theoretical models proposed in the literature .",
    "future measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 production in semi - inclusive charged lepton dis will improve the situation and this can be generalized to the case of the production of the other hyperons @xmath3 .",
    "the new polarized @xmath16 collider at rhic - bnl , with high luminosity and high energy , is also a very powerful facility to study unpolarized and polarized fragmentation functions for all octet baryon members ."
