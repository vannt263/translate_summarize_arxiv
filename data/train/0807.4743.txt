    "foams behave elastically with stress proportional to strain . above the yield strain or stress ,",
    "bubble rearrangements occur and the system behaves as a liquid .",
    "in contrast to newtonian fluids , foams display complex spatio - temporal behavior in response to applied shear including intermittency , shear banding , and nonlinear velocity profiles @xcite . despite a number of experimental , numerical , and theoretical studies of driven foams , a fundamental understanding of the response of foam to applied shear is still lacking .    in this article",
    ", we describe a coordinated set of experimental and numerical studies of model 2d foams undergoing applied oscillatory planar shear to characterize the transition from solid- to liquid - like behavior and from linear to nonlinear velocity profiles .",
    "there have been several studies of the response of foam to steady shear , however , most of these have been performed in the couette geometry in which flow is confined between two concentric cylinders @xcite .",
    "instead , we focus on planar shear to avoid the ` trivial ' transition to nonlinear velocity profiles that stems from the fact that in the couette geometry the shear stress varies with distance from the center of the shearing cell .    another distinguishing feature of this work is its focus on _ oscillatory _ rather than steady shear as the driving mechanism .",
    "there are several reasons for selecting oscillatory shear .",
    "first , oscillatory shear allows one to control the amplitude independently from the frequency of the driving . when foams ( and other complex fluids ) are driven by _",
    "steady _ shear , they exist in a highly fluidized state that is characterized by continuous , often highly correlated bubble rearrangements , or t1 events @xcite . in the highly fluidized state ,",
    "the statistics of t1 events determine the flow curve and control stress fluctuations @xcite .",
    "with oscillatory shear , one can study the low - amplitude flow regime in which particle rearrangement events do not occur , yet the system can transition from solid- to liquid - like behavior and from linear to nonlinear velocity profiles as the driving frequency is increased . since t1 events can be suppressed when using oscillatory shear at low amplitude , the dissipation between fluid films becomes the dominant relaxation mechanism @xcite .",
    "thus , in this regime one can directly probe the dissipation mechanism by tuning the driving frequency .    in this article , we report on combined experiments and simulations on model 2d foams : bubble rafts in experiments @xcite and the bubble model in simulations @xcite .",

    "experiments on 2d bubble rafts will be compared to simulations of the 2d bubble model introduced by durian  @xcite .",
    "the bubble model treats foams as soft disks that experience two pairwise forces when they overlap : a repulsive linear spring force proportional to bubble overlap and a dissipative force proportional to velocity differences between bubbles",
    ". a useful feature of the bubble model is that it can be generalized to particles with finite mass @xcite .",

    "thus , a comparison of experiments of bubble rafts and simulations of the bubble model in a well - controlled planar shear geometry will allow us to further test under what conditions the bubble model accurately captures the dynamics of model foams .",
    "we will focus on measurements of the total phase shift between the driving wall and interior bubble displacements , and velocity profiles in systems subjected to low - amplitude oscillatory planar shear . at low driving frequencies @xmath0 , we observe a non - zero total phase shift , while the velocity profiles rise linearly with distance from the stationary wall . at low frequencies ,",

    "this can only be due to motion in the fluid films , and emphasizes that further quantitative studies of film - level dissipation mechanisms are crucial to understanding foam rheology @xcite .",
    "second , studies of the response of 3d foams and emulsions to oscillatory shear suggest that there are important differences between the two systems in the low - amplitude regime @xcite . thus , studying the low - amplitude regime will highlight key differences in the mechanical response of a variety of soft glassy materials . finally , in this article we presented novel results that demonstrate the existence of two additional time ( or frequency ) scales associated with the response of foam to applied shear : @xmath26 and @xmath121 ( or @xmath8 ) .",

    "a quantitative comparison between the bubble raft experiments and bubble model simulations also provides a method to calibrate the gas area - fraction of the bubble rafts , which is notoriously difficult to measure in foam experiments .",
    "of the three frequently used quasi - two dimensional experimental setups ( bubble rafts , bubble rafts with a top glass plate , and bubbles confined between two solid surfaces ) , it is most difficult to define the area fraction in the bubble rafts . by combining the bubble model simulations and surface evolver computations @xcite",
