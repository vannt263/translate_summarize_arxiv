    "in the last few years there has been considerable interest generated in a model for quantum gravity in which the functional integral over metrics ( ill - defined in the continuum ) is replaced by a discrete sum over random triangulations .",
    "the initial proposal @xcite arose as a natural generalisation of random surface theories in two dimensions .",
    "the results of these numerical studies were encouraging and were confirmed by other groups @xcite .",
    "the most exciting possibility was the observation of a possible phase transition for a critical value of the bare newton constant .",
    "the hope was that a nonperturbative quantum theory for gravity could be recovered in the vicinity of this new fixed point .",
    "these observations were rendered more quantitative by the recent work @xcite in which a serious finite size scaling study was performed .",
    "the model is defined from the partition function . @xmath1",
    "the sum is restricted to run over all simplicial manifolds ( triangulations ) with the topology of @xmath2 .",
    "the first term in the action @xmath3 is just the number of four simplices in the triangulation @xmath4 and this allows us to identify the corresponding coupling @xmath5 as a bare cosmological constant .",
    "the second term depends only on the number of vertices in the triangulation @xmath6 and plays the role of the integrated ricci scalar ",
    "the coupling @xmath7 is then essentially the inverse bare newton constant .",
    "this correspondence is clear classically from the usual regge expression for the curvature associated to any triangle @xmath8 with the extra constraint that the four simplices are all considered equilateral @xmath9 notice that if the volume is bounded , the number of four simplices shared by a given triangle @xmath10 is necessarily also bounded .",
    "this automatically ensures that the model is well defined at finite volume  it is a dynamical question as to whether the problems associated to the unboundedness of the continuum action return on taking the large volume limit .",
    "as we have remarked , the analogous model in two dimensions has been studied extensively , see , for example , the review @xcite .",
    "it seems clear that at least for central charges less than unity , the sum over triangulated graphs correctly mimics the continuum functional integrals over the metric including the conformal anomaly . in four dimensions it is not at all clear that a simple generalisation , such as the one described above , is sufficient to explore the space of metrics",
    "however , it constitutes a simple ansatz which may be studied using numerical simulation .",
    "we may rewrite eqn.[eqn1 ] in the form @xmath11 the partial sum @xmath12 counts the number of triangulations ( weighted by the ricci term ) with volume @xmath3 .",
    "the results we discuss here are concerned with the volume dependence of this entropy function @xmath12 .",
    "it is helpful at this point to recall the behaviour of the equivalent two dimensional model .",
    "two dimensional gravity regulated using dynamical triangulations has a partition analogous to eqn .",
    "the number of simplices is now just @xmath13 with corresponding cosmological constant @xmath14 .",
    "the coupling @xmath7 plays no role in two dimensions as the number of vertices @xmath6 is strictly proportional to the number of two simplices @xmath15 if the euler character @xmath16 is kept constant ( for example @xmath17 ) .",
    "if we sum over all two dimensional triangulations with fixed volume we arrive at a quantity @xmath18 analogous to @xmath19 for the four dimensional theory .",
    "there are rigorous proofs @xcite that this quantity is exponentially bounded .",
    "@xmath20 this property is _ crucial _ for the very existence of the partition function .",
    "it implies that for a sufficiently large bare cosmological constant @xmath21 the partition function will be finite .",
    "the thermodynamic limit @xmath22 is then obtained by tuning @xmath14 towards this critical value @xmath23 .",
    "the mean volume @xmath24 then behaves as @xmath25 .",
    "if the number of triangulations were to increase faster than exponentially , it would be impossible to tune the bare cosmological constant to approach the large volume limit in a regular fashion  the partition function would be dominated by infinite volume triangulations independent of the bare lattice parameters .",
    "constructing a continuum limit would then be impossible .",
    "thus , it is absolutely essential for the very existence of these higher dimensional models that there be such a bound .",
    "unfortunately , there are no analytic proofs available for dimension greater than two . if the topology is not fixed it can be shown that the number of triangulations increases factorially with volume even in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "the situation is made worse by the lack of any topological classification of three and four dimensional manifolds .",
    "faced with this we have used numerical simulation to estimate the volume of the triangulation space . whilst the previous studies @xcite have claimed evidence for an exponential bound we believe the issue is of such paramount importance that a very detailed study is required .",
    "indeed , the results we shall present favour a very different scenario .",
    "for an entropy function that behaves exponentially with volume we have argued that it is possible to choose the coupling @xmath5 to fix the mean volume @xmath26 . in practice",
    "this is a difficult fine tuning problem . even under the assumption of an exponential bound ,",
    "the entropy @xmath12 is of the form    @xmath27    we have included the leading power law correction parametrised by @xmath28 . in practice",
    "the power @xmath29 is negative , so that the partition function is dominated by small or large volumes depending on the sign of @xmath30 .",
    "this problem has been tackled in a variety of ways .",
    "we have followed the approach of migdal et al .",
    "@xcite and added to the action a small correction term of the form @xmath31 replacing the sums by integrals and forgetting for the moment any power law corrections it is now simple to obtain a relation between the mean volume @xmath32 and the parameters in the action .",
    "@xmath33 thus tuning @xmath5 to yield an average volume @xmath0 yields a measurement of the coupling @xmath34 .",
    "the auxiliary coupling @xmath35 merely controls the magnitude of volume fluctuations .",
    "we have set @xmath36 .",
    "the presence of power law ( and other subleading ) corrections gives @xmath34 a volume dependence @xmath37 .",
    "the relation eqn .",
    "[ iter ] may be rewritten @xmath38    in practice we iterate the above relation during the thermalisation stage of our simulation and apply it once more at the end of our run to compute our final estimate for @xmath39 .    in this picture the presence of an exponential bound would be signalled by this critical cosmological constant @xmath40 having a finite limit for large volumes @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast @xmath40 would increase logarithmically in a model for which @xmath12 grew factorially with volume ( this just follows from the asymptotic result @xmath41 ) .",
    "notice that it is sufficient to prove an exponential bound for a single value of @xmath7  the following inequality guarantees that there will then be a bound for any other @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43    we have used a monte carlo algorithm to sample the triangulation space of the model  the details are given in @xcite .",
    "our code is written in such a way as to make the dependence on dimension @xmath44 trivial ",
    "it enters only as an input parameter to the program .",
    "we have simulated systems from size @xmath45 to @xmath46 . typical runs utilised on the order of @xmath47 mc sweeps with one sweep corresponding to @xmath0 trial updates . in addition",
    "we performed a series of runs for both the two dimensional and three dimensional models .",
    "the results of these simulations could then be contrasted with the equivalent four dimensional data and served as an important test of our code .",
    "fig .  [ fig1 ] is a plot of the critical cosmological coupling @xmath48 against the logarithm of the volume for the two , three and four dimensional models at @xmath49 ( to improve clarity we plot @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) .",
    "clearly , the presence of an exponential bound emerges very clearly in the two dimensional case ",
    "@xmath52 is statistically consistent with a constant @xmath53 for volumes @xmath54 .    for three dimensions the situation is rather different .",
    "the finite volume dependence of @xmath55 is large over the full range of volumes analysed . however , as the plot reveals there is no strong evidence of a logarithmic component  indeed the best fit we could make to the data corresponds to a _",
    "convergent _ power law ( the solid line in the figure ) @xmath56 .",
    "the fit yields @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 with a @xmath60 per degree of freedom @xmath61 .",
    "thus , our data in three dimensions favours a bound",
    ". indeed these numbers are consistent with the ones quoted in a previous study by ambjrn and varsted @xcite who give @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "their fit derives from lattice sizes of @xmath65 and smaller with lower statistics but it is reassuring to see that we are in pretty good agreement .",
    "we are currently extending our dimension three runs to larger lattices to strengthen our confidence in the three dimensional bound .",
    "the situation in four dimensions is radically different .",
    "clearly , the data support the hypothesis that there is a logarithmic component to the critical volume coupling @xmath66 .",
    "a fit of all the @xmath67 data to a simple logarithm @xmath68 results in a value for @xmath69 with a @xmath60 per degree of freedom @xmath70 ( solid line shown ) .",
    "converging power fits simply fail to describe the data .    to test this hypothesis",
    "further we looked at the situation for non zero @xmath7 .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows a plot of @xmath71 for @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the inequality eqn.[ineq ] implies that the coefficient of this logarithm should be universal ( independent of @xmath7 ) .",
    "the leading effect of a non zero value for @xmath7 is simply a renormalisation of any exponential terms in @xmath19 .",
    "this is confirmed by the data in fig .",
    "although the curves start out with different gradients their large volume behaviour appears to be the same .",
    "however the plot makes it also clear that the onset of this asymptotic regime is dependent on @xmath7  as @xmath7 increases the curves start off increasingly flat and the logarithm only manifests itself for large volumes .",
    "we found that very long runs were required to thermalise the four dimensional lattices .",
    "the initial configurations were created by employing only the node insertion move which effectively generates lattices corresponding to large values of @xmath7 . for the largest volumes we employed , @xmath46",
    ", we found that subsequent relaxation times were of the order of @xmath75 sweeps .",
    "this difficulty of reaching true equilibrium was the main factor in determining the largest volumes we could reach .",
    "it is perhaps a practical demonstration of the results reported in @xcite in which the algorithmic unrecognisability of four manifolds is shown to lead to a lack of a reasonable bound on the number of local moves needed to pass from one configuration to another .",
    "thus our four dimensional data would indicate that the entropy @xmath76 has a leading behaviour @xmath77    if we fit the @xmath78 data for the three largest volumes by straight lines we find consistent estimates for the exponent @xmath79 .",
    "these are @xmath80 respectively .",
    "we would then assign our best estimate for @xmath79 as @xmath81 .",
    "in summary , we have presented results which are consistent with a leading factorial behaviour for the entropy of triangulations of the four sphere @xmath76 .",
    "specifically , the number of triangulations of @xmath2 grows like @xmath82 furthermore , we estimate the exponent @xmath81 .",
    "this rapid growth renders it impossible to take the thermodynamic ( large volume ) limit  the partition function for any @xmath7 is dominated by large volumes .",
    "this in turn implies there is no continuum limit for the model .",
    "we have argued that the presence of large finite volume effects can obscure this behaviour for large values of the inverse bare newton constant ( @xmath7 ) on lattices that are computationally accessible .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that the rather rapid shift of the pseudo critical node coupling reported in @xcite is further evidence for the lack of a well - defined continuum limit .",
    "the data presented in @xcite is not inconsistent with a scenario in which this pseudo - critical coupling diverges as the mean volume approaches infinity , leaving the system in an extremely crumpled , degenerate phase .",
    "it is important to notice also that the term added to help fine tune the cosmological constant @xmath5 is now playing a crucial role in defining the partition function .",
    "there is now no reason to believe that different methods of doing this are equivalent .",
    "clearly an extension of this work ( with perhaps a more refined method for computing @xmath40 ) to larger volumes and node couplings would help to confirm these conclusions .",
