    "planets can satisfy these criteria by transiting nearby small stars : the local m dwarfs .",
    "observations from the _ kepler _  mission indicate that early m dwarf stars host , on average , @xmath7 planets per star , for planetary radii between @xmath8@xmath0  and orbital periods shorter than 50 days @xcite .",

    "[ s : results ] , we discuss the results and compare them directly to the m dwarf planet statistics from _ kepler_. in  [ s : future ] , we demonstrate how to harness these findings to improve mearth s planet yield in the years to come .",

    "mearth employs eight robotic 40-cm telescopes at the fred lawrence whipple observatory atop mt .",

    "the cameras are sensitive to 7151000 nm wavelengths , with the bandpass shaped by a fixed schott rg715 filter and the quantum efficiency of our back - illuminated e2v ccd42 - 40 detectors .",
    "the light curves analyzed in this paper were gathered between 2 october 2008 and 23 june 2012 . except for the annual monsoon season typically spanning july to september and occasional instrumental failures , mearth observed every clear night during these four years .",

    "mearth differs from wide - field transit searches .",
    "targeting the brightest mid - to - late m dwarfs spread across the sky , mearth observes each star one - by - one in a pointed fashion . as such",
    ", mearth can tailor exposure times to individual targets ; we observe each target long enough in each visit that its expected rms from photon and scintillation noise is 1/3 the transit depth of a 2@xmath0  planet .",
    "if necessary ( to avoid saturation ) , we gather multiple exposures within each visit to meet this goal . for the estimated @xmath14@xmath10  radii of mearth targets @xcite , these correspond to photometric precisions of @xmath15 per visit .",
    "thanks to a comparatively small pixel scale ( 0.76\" / pixel ) and the large proper motion on which our targets were selected ( @xmath16 ; from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , blended background eclipsing binaries are not a significant source of false positives ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for contrast ) .",
    "mearth s cadence is also unique .",
    "transits of these stars have typical durations of @xmath17 hours .",
    "mearth observes each star roughly once every 2030 minutes , reduces the data in realtime , and can trigger immediate high - cadence monitoring of interesting in - progress transit events . by gathering many observations of a transit s egress with this realtime trigger mode , mearth can confirm the presence of a planet from a single transit . as we discuss in ",
    "[ s : future ] , this mode can substantially improve mearth s sensitivity to long period planets .",
    "the realtime trigger was operational for most of @xmath18 , but was under continual development to ramp up its sensitivity during this time .",
    "figure [ f : radii ] shows the estimated radii of the mearth stars analyzed in this paper . for comparison , the _ kepler _  early m dwarf sample analyzed by @xcite is also included",
    "the _ kepler _  m dwarfs are strongly biased toward earlier spectral types , near the k / m boundary .",
    "the radius estimates for the mearth sample are drawn from @xcite .",

    "[ s : stellar_errors ] .",
    "all m dwarf light curves from mearth are made publicly available for the community to use .",
    "data are released on a yearly schedule , and can be found online at http://www.cfa.harvard.edu / mearth/. the online release contains extensive notes on the data processing methods , and on the properties of the survey as a whole .",
    "we eagerly encourage those interested in the photometric variability of nearby mid - to - late m dwarfs , or the possible presence of planets around them , to make broad use of mearth s public light curves .      for the analyses presented in this work , only m dwarf light curves consisting of more than 100 good visits are included .",
    "for the four seasons since 2008 , there were @xmath19 $ ] such light curves .",
    "we excluded from the statistical analysis all light curves where genuine astrophysical eclipse signals were detected during the course of the survey , as they are dominated by high cadence follow - up observations and do not reflect our blind survey sensitivity .",
    "these objects are gj1214 @xcite , gj 3236 @xcite , nltt 41135 @xcite , and lspm j1112 + 7626 @xcite .",
    "most stars were observed for only a single season , but not all . some m dwarfs ( 140 in total )",
    "were observed in two , three , or four seasons .",
    "one season typically dominates the sensitivity to planets in these cases ; for simplicity , we include only the most sensitive season - long light curve for each star in the statistical analysis , thus slightly underestimating our true sensitivity . in total ,",
    "988 unique m dwarfs are represented here .",
    "we make strict data quality cuts .",
    "we flag and remove any exposures in which thick clouds were present ( worse than 0.25 magnitudes of losses ) , the target s position was offset from its median on the detector by more than @xmath20 , images show extremely large fwhm ( @xmath21 above its median ) or high ellipticity ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 of comparison stars show @xmath24 outliers in their light curves , or @xmath25 of the other exposures within a 4 hour window were excluded for any other reason .",
    "some exposures , originally identified as contributing to candidate eclipse signals , were found to contain anomalies ( inopportune glints or satellite tracks , shutter blade failures , other defects ) and were also excluded .",
    "a total of @xmath1 exposures distributed over @xmath26 independent visits survive these cuts and contribute to the analysis .",
    "we aim to interpret mearth s one planet detection and many non - detections in the light of the statistical rate of occurrence around these small stars .",
    "doing so requires an estimate of the ensemble sensitivity of the survey to hypothetical planets during the past four seasons .",
    "we define mearth s ensemble sensitivity , @xmath27 , as the number of planets with a particular radius @xmath28 and orbital period @xmath29 that mearth should have found if all stars in our sample had one planet with that radius and period .",
    "we calculate the ensemble sensitivity as @xmath30 where the functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the per - star transit probability and the per - star detection efficiency , respectively .",
    "our targets span a factor of @xmath33 in stellar radius , and each star has its own observational coverage and light curve properties . as such , we calculate each of these functions individually on a star - by - star basis .",
    "the sum is over the @xmath34 stars in the sample .",
    "in addition to @xmath27 , we also calculate our sensitivity as a function of the equilibrium temperature @xmath35 that a planet on a circular orbit would have , assuming zero albedo and efficient heat redistribution .",
    "we refer to this sensitivity as @xmath36 and will use the two `` period - like '' parameters @xmath29 and @xmath35 somewhat interchangeably hereafter . in our definition , @xmath35 is identically related to the bolometric flux the planet receives from the star and has a one - to - one correspondence with @xmath29 , given each star s estimated mass and luminosity simply for ease of scaling .",
    "the relation that @xmath37 can be used to translate to a chosen planetary albedo . ] .",
    "we use @xmath35 simply to describe a planet s rough energy budget ; the physical conditions throughout the planet will depend on many more factors than can be encapsulated by a single parameter . for example , the shape of the star s input spectral energy distribution can have a strong influence on a planet s surface level atmospheric properties and ( at temperatures cooler than those primarily probed in this paper ) habitability ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; our @xmath35 should not be interpreted more deeply than as a useful shorthand for the amount of energy impinging the top of a planet s atmosphere .",
    "the first factor in equation [ e : sensitivity ] , @xmath31 , is the probability that a planet is geometrically aligned such that transits occur in the system .",
    "we take @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the stellar radius and @xmath40 is the semi - major axis ; this is the probability that a planet in a circular orbit would have an impact parameter @xmath41 . from kepler s third law and assuming the planet s mass is negligible , @xmath42^{1/3}$ ] where @xmath43 is newton s constant .",
    "we estimate the mean stellar density @xmath44 from archival observations of each target ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we discuss the impact of uncertainties in @xmath45 on our @xmath27 in ",
    "[ s : stellar_errors ] .",
    "non - zero eccentricity can increase ( or decrease ) transit probabilities for planets with earth - ward periastrons ( or apoastrons ) , but the net effect for blind transit surveys is small on average . for a reasonable underlying distribution of eccentricities , assuming circular orbits underestimates the total sensitivity of a photon - limited survey by only @xmath46 and of a completely red - noise dominated survey by @xmath47 @xcite . with our sparse sampling , our ability to correct for known systematic effects , and the short @xmath48 hr transit durations we are targeting ,",
    "mearth s sensitivity is influenced but not dominated by red noise @xcite .",
    "as such , we expect the eccentricity bias to be less than about @xmath49 and ignore it .",
    "the second factor , @xmath32 , is the probability that a planet aligned to transit would exhibit one or more such transits while mearth was observing and that the signal would be strong enough cross an appropriate detection threshold . for idealized surveys",
    ", @xmath50 can be calculated analytically @xcite , given a typical photometric precision and number of observations .",
    "kepler s detection efficiency appears to match these predictions quite well @xcite . without the benefit of _ kepler _ s uniform cadence , coverage , and noise properties , we turn to simulations to estimate @xmath50 for mearth .    into each mearth light curve , we inject simulated , limb - darkened transit signals @xcite .",
    "the fake planets are generated on a grid of planetary radii spanning 1.54@xmath0 , and have random periods between 0.25 and 20 days , random epochs , and random impact parameters between @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( all drawn from uniform distributions ) . in @xcite , we develop a framework for assessing the significance of transit signals in mearth data .",
    "this framework , the method to include starspots and systematics in the marginalized probability of a lone eclipse ( miss marple ) , is designed to provide robust detection statistics for transit signals amidst systematic noise sources arising from instrumental / telluric effects or from stellar variability .",
    "we inject the signals into our basic light curves , process those light curves with miss marple , and estimate the signal - to - noise ratio at which the injected signal would be recovered .",
    "we iterate this process 50,000 times for each star , to map out the planetary parameter space .",
    "we estimate the transit significance at the known period and epoch of the injected signal ; we do not perform a phased period search for each injected signal . because we skip the computationally costly period search , these simulations know nothing about whether or not the existing mearth light curve would be enough to recover the correct period for the planet .",
    "this is okay ; we are interested merely in whether or not a strong enough signal would exist in the data that we would track it down with targeted follow - up observations .",
    "a crucial component is the decision of a detection significance threshold .",
    "miss marple both corrects for stellar variability and instrumental systematics and keeps track of the excess uncertainty these corrections introduce to the marginalized transit depth uncertainties ( @xmath53 ) of candidate transit signals .",
    "in that work , we found that all period - phased mearth candidates above a transit depth signal - to - noise of @xmath54 were either catastrophic instrumental problems , obvious stellar variability artifacts , or bonafide eclipsing systems @xcite .",
    "gj1214b was identified in 2009 before the development of the full miss marple framework , using the box - fitting least squares search algorithm @xcite and pre - cleaning with an iterative median filter @xcite and trend filtering algorithm @xcite . reanalyzing the data available up to the time of gj1214b s original identification , we find that miss marple would have recovered the signal with @xmath55 .",
    "we take @xmath54 as our detection threshold for the following analysis .",
    "we emphasize that this is a _ phased _ transit significance , meaning that multiple transits can folded together to build up @xmath56 . for neptune - sized planets ,",
    "a single transit observed at 25 minute cadence can often cross this threshold by itself .",
    "we impose no lower limit on the number of transits required for a detection , so such planets would be considered as recovered . for the main results in ",
    "[ s : results ] , we do not explicitly model detecting planets from single transits with mearth s realtime trigger mode . because the realtime trigger was continually being improved throughout the survey , it is difficult to quantify the extent to which it boosted our sensitivity . in  [ s : results ] , we choose to include data that were gathered as part of high - cadence follow - up , but we do not simulate the generation of new triggers .",
    "as such , mearth s actual sensitivity may have been higher than we quote .",
    "we explore the effect that the realtime trigger can have on our sensitivity in  [ s : future ] .",
    "note that in this context , `` detected '' at @xmath57 means that a candidate would have high enough significance that , after a thorough visual vetting , we would begin follow - up observations to confirm the transits and to measure the system s period . using a detection threshold lower than @xmath57 would make mearth appear more sensitive , but drawing statistical inferences would require that we prove the candidates above that threshold were either real or statistical flukes .",
    "we are in the process of vetting the most promising @xmath58 candidates , but have not yet determined whether they are bona fide planets or not . for simplicity , we simply adopt the more conservative @xmath57 threshold .",
    "we explored changing the assumed detection threshold down to @xmath59 and up to @xmath60 .",
    "we found that the quantitative results in ",
    "[ s : results ] and  [ s : future ] do change , but the qualitative conclusions do not .    figure [ f : sample ] visualizes the results of our simulations of the phased - search per - star detection efficiency @xmath61 .",
    "each panel corresponds to a different slice of planetary radius and period , and contains one circle for every star in the sample .",
    "as expected , mearth s ability to discover planets in a phased search falls off toward longer periods and smaller radii .",
    "the symbol area scales linearly with the number of observations mearth gathered of that star , demonstrating how @xmath61 grows with the number of measurements gathered , and saturates for large radii and short periods .",
    "the simulations have effectively integrated over impact parameters @xmath62 .",
    "because @xmath61 accounts for grazing eclipses being more difficult to detect , it never reaches unity .",
    "the downturn in the upper envelope of @xmath61 toward the smaller stars for short - period , neptune - sized planets is caused by the breakdown of miss marple s assumption that transits will be box - shaped .",
    "the mismatch in shape would be treated as excess nightly noise in the marple framework , and these transits significance down - weighted . a more flexible trapezoidal assumption for the light curve shape",
    "@xcite would be able to improve sensitivity in this corner of parameter space .",
    "mearth s actual sensitivity depends on how well we understand the physical masses and radii of the stars in our sample .",
    "for this work , we adopt the stellar parameters as derived in @xcite .",
    "these parameter estimates are not necessarily the best estimates currently possible , and introduce uncertainties into our statistical analysis . in this section ,",
    "we describe those uncertainties and quantify their overall effects .",
    "first , the masses and radii are imprecise .",
    "although some stellar parameter estimates were based on literature geometric or spectroscopic parallaxes , many are based on photographic plate measurements with substantial uncertainties .",
    "high proper motions ensure the sample is free of giants , but the roughly 30% uncertainties in stellar radii directly translate into comparably large uncertainties in the planetary radius to which a given transit depth corresponds .",
    "second , some stars may be contaminated with unresolved binaries .",
    "we made small efforts to remove some known binaries from our sample , such as those that @xcite identified as visual binaries resolved on input photographic plates or those indicated as spectroscopic binaries in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , these efforts took place concurrently while we were already gathering data and are still far from complete .",
    "mearth definitely observed some contaminating binaries as part of the sample analyzed here .",
    "the additional flux from a binary companion dilutes transit depths , as well as perturbing the stellar parameters that we infer from ( spectro)photometry .",
    "these two effects have impacts on both @xmath63 and @xmath64 . to prevent them from biasing our ensemble sensitivity estimate",
    ", we simulate their influence in a monte carlo fashion and apply a correction to our final estimate of @xmath27 . in these simulations , we perturb the assumed mass of each star by a 30% gaussian uncertainty combined with a prior so that the star is drawn from the local stellar mass function @xcite . including the stellar mass function tends to increase the masses of those stars that were originally inferred to be the least massive , those below the mass function peak .",
    "we use the mass - radius - luminosity relations of @xcite to generate new radii and luminosities from these masses .",
    "we randomly assign binary companions to each star , assuming a 34% multiplicity rate @xcite and uniform mass - ratio distribution ( treating the original star as the primary ) .",
    "we shift the values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 according to the simulated system s updated properties .",
    "we apply this process to all the stars included in the sample , calculate the updated @xmath27 and @xmath36 , and repeat 20 times for the ensemble .",
    "we take the averages of these distributions as our best - guess sensitivity estimates .",
    "the final sensitivity estimates are shown in figure [ f : sensitivity ] , both as a function of orbital period [ @xmath27 ] and as a function of planet s zero - albedo equilibrium temperature [ @xmath36 ] . because the mearth stars span a range of effective temperatures , the mapping between these two parameter spaces is not necessarily one - to - one .",
    "the detectability of planets near or below 2@xmath0  depends strongly on the inferred stellar radius of each star , so the above perturbation analysis introduces substantial uncertainties into the sensitivity for these smaller planets .",
    "in contrast , 4@xmath0  planets are often far above the detection threshold , so sensitivity depends weakly on the exact stellar radius . in most cases ,",
    "the post - perturbation sensitivity decreased relative to the naive estimates .",
    "however , for planets smaller than 2@xmath0 , the sensitivity increased relative to the naive estimate , thanks to some stars stars having radii smaller than originally assumed , so that mearth s exposure times designed to detect 2@xmath0  planets could actually pick up even smaller planets .    throughout this section",
    ", we test a variety of hypotheses against these sensitivity curves . sometimes , we consider planets of particular periods @xmath29 , other times planets with particular equilibrium temperatures @xmath35 .",
    "we explore both parameters because we do not know the answer to the following question : when comparing samples of planets orbiting stars of different masses , what parameters define a planet population ?",
    "are two planets orbiting different stars comparable if they share the same radius ? or should they have the same mass , the same planet - to - star mass ratio , the same ratio to the isolation mass ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or some other shared trait ? are two planets similar if they have the same period , the same semimajor axis , the same @xmath67 , the same proximity to the snow line , or something else ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the likelihood seems small that any simple answer for this big question could emerge . in the context of this uncertainty ,",
    "we explore two representative examples .",
    "we consider period @xmath29 as a population - defining parameter simply because it is closely tied to what we can detect ; it may not be the most fundamental physical parameter .",
    "we suspect the bolometric flux the planet receives from the host star ( as parameterized by @xmath35 ) may be important for us because mearth is most sensitive to planets larger than 2@xmath0  and that are very close - in to their stars . in the _ kepler _  context , @xcite and @xcite have argued that close - in @xmath68@xmath0  planets , most of which will have gaseous outer layers , have been sculpted in large part by thermal evolution and atmospheric mass loss . the dependence of these processes on the amount of bolometric ( and uv ) flux that a planet receives motivates us to explore @xmath35 as a population - defining parameter in the following analyses .",
    "we do not explicitly simulate our sensitivity to @xmath69@xmath0  exoplanets .",
    "however , figure [ f : sensitivity ] still encodes mearth s ability to detect gas giants .",
    "transits of jupiter - sized ( 11@xmath0 ) exoplanets are 8% deep for mearth s largest targeted m dwarfs ( 0.35@xmath10 ) , and could be as deep as 100% for the smallest m dwarfs .",
    "planets this big could be detected at extremely high significance with a single mearth observation .",
    "our jupiter sensitivity is probably very close to the survey window function in figure [ f : sensitivity ] , and is definitely bounded between the window function and the neptune - size ( 4@xmath0 ) sensitivity curve .",
    "conservatively , we ll assume the jupiter sensitivity lies halfway between these two curves , in log space .",
    "figure [ f : sensitivity ] then indicates that if every m dwarf hosted exactly one jupiter - sized planet in a 1.0 day orbit , mearth should have found 70 such planets . by inverting a poisson distribution",
    ", we can translate this statement into a 95% confidence upper limit that the occurrence of such 1-day jupiters is @xmath70 planets / star in our sample .",
    "this upper limit is not surprising .",
    "radial velocity surveys show that about 1% of solar - type stars",
    "host of hot jupiters @xcite and that giant planet occurrence ( across all periods ) decreases toward less massive stellar hosts @xcite .",
    "only two warm jupiters are known to transit m dwarfs @xcite , and for both systems the 0.6@xmath13  host stars are so massive that they sit at the boundary of the k and m spectral types .",
    "mearth can also place an upper limit on the presence of jupiters in orbits approaching m dwarfs habitable zones . from the right panel of figure",
    "[ f : sensitivity ] , if every star hosted a jupiter - sized planet with a zero - albedo equilibrium temperature of 300k , mearth should have found 7 .",
    "our non - detection of any 300k jupiters translates to @xmath71 planets / star for such planets at 95% confidence , again showing contradiction neither with m dwarf radial velocity surveys @xcite nor with microlensing surveys @xcite .",
    "our findings from mearth agree with other surveys that jupiter - sized planets are uncommon around m dwarfs .",
    "we do not placer deeper limits than other surveys , although we do probe a less massive population of potential stellar hosts than they do . to be sensitive to small planets , mearth observes a small number of stars with high photometric precision .",
    "placing deeper constraints on the occurrence of jupiter - sized planets can be better achieved by those surveys that monitor a larger number of m dwarfs , such as ptf / m - dwarfs @xcite or the wfcam transit survey @xcite .",
    "mearth is very sensitive to transits of planets the size of neptune ; the 4@xmath0  sensitivity curve is within a factor of two of the observational window function ( the best we could possibly do ) across the period and temperature ranges plotted in figure [ f : sensitivity ] . in light of this sensitivity ,",
    "how does our lack of detections of transiting neptunes compare with known populations ?    in particular ,",

    "figure [ f : sensitivity ] indicates that mearth should have found 20 neptune - sized planets in 3 day periods if every one of our targets hosted such a planet , or 60 neptune - sized planets with 650k temperatures , if every star had one .",
    "the corresponding 95% confidence upper limits are @xmath720.15 planets / star or @xmath720.06 planets / star , depending on whether orbital period or the flux received from the star more genuinely define the population . for comparison , on the basis of two radial velocity planet detections from harps , @xcite report that @xmath73 of stars in their m dwarf sample host planets with minimum masses ( @xmath74 ) between 10 and 100@xmath9  and orbital periods of 1 to 10 days . on the basis of one transit detection ,",

    "determining whether the difference between these two numbers can be attributed to features in the densities for planets in this regime ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will require a more thorough analysis than we wish to present here and a reduction in the poisson uncertainties in the measurements .",
    "the upper limits from mearth do not contradict either of these measurements .    for a consistency check , it is interesting to ask whether we would have expected the two transiting radial velocity neptunes gl436b and gj3470b to have been discovered , given the number of radial velocity planets that are not known to transit .",
    "@xcite compiled a list of all known planets orbiting m dwarfs .",
    "this list contains 10 non - transiting planets detected in radial velocity surveys with minimum masses in the range of @xmath77@xmath9 .",
    "we supplement this list with the two transiting systems and add up the values of the _ a priori _ transit probability (= @xmath78 ) for the 12 published radial velocity planets in this mass range .",
    "we find that the total expected number of radial velocity planets that should transit is 0.5 .",
    "an analysis using the planets and parameters listed in the exoplanets.org database @xcite yields the same result .",
    "the poisson probability of having @xmath79 detections when 0.5 are expected is only 9% .",
    "gl436b and gj3470b themselves may have been slightly lucky transit detections , and the probability is low that additional m dwarf transiting planets still lurk among the published radial velocity detections .",
    "in  [ s : jupiters ] and  [ s : neptunes ] , we made rough statements based on visual inspection of the sensitivity curves in figure [ f : sensitivity ] .",
    "these point estimates effectively treat the underlying planet populations as @xmath80-functions in radius - period - temperature space . directly integrating mearth s sensitivity against hypothesized occurrence rate distributions",
    "is a more satisfying approach , and one that we adopt in this section to interpret our single 2.7@xmath0 , 1.6 day , 570k planet detection gj1214b .",
    "we directly compare our single planet to how many planets we should have found assuming certain extrapolations from _",
    "kepler_.    throughout , we assume gj1214b s orbital eccentricity is @xmath81 .",
    "a finite eccentricity could both alter gj1214b s size @xcite and ( modestly ) bias its transit probability , but the effect on our statistical inferences remain small compared to the poisson uncertainty of a single detection .",
    "following @xcite , we define a planet occurrence distribution function @xmath82 as the number of planets per star per ( base 10 ) logarithmic interval in radius and period . with this , we can calculate the number of planets we should have expected to find as @xmath83 where the integrals are carried out over the radius and period ranges of interest .",
    "the expression is identical as a function of equilibrium temperature , simply exchanging @xmath35 for @xmath29 .",
    "@xcite quote occurrence rates in bins of radius and period , but the bins are large compared to the scales on which mearth s sensitivity changes substantially . to allow smooth interpolation over the parameter space and improve the accuracy of our calculation of @xmath84 , we were motivated to fit analytic functions to the distribution .",
    "we do so in the appendix , using the non - binning maximum likelihood formalism of @xcite and the updated m dwarf and planetary parameters for the cool _ kepler _  objects of interest from @xcite . the results of these fits are analytic expressions for @xmath82 and @xmath85 , along with mcmc samples that can be used to propagate the uncertainties in these distributions forward .",
    "figure [ f : contours_period ] shows the steps leading to @xmath84 , if we assume planetary occurrence as a function of planetary radius and orbital period ",
    "@xmath82  is exactly the same ( in both shape and normalization ) between _ kepler _ s m dwarfs and the mearth sample .",
    "the left panel shows @xmath27 , and the middle panel shows our fit to the _ kepler _  m dwarf occurrence distribution .",
    "the right panel shows the product of the first two panels ( the integrand in equation [ e : nexpected ] ) , which we refer to as mearth s expected yield . expressed as an average over the first four years of the mearth survey ,",
    "the integral over the plotted parameter space predicts a total yield of @xmath86 planets / year , where the error bar represents the central @xmath87 range of an ensemble of @xmath84 estimates calculated by randomly sampling both from our perturbed @xmath27 curves (  [ s : stellar_errors ] ) and from the markov chain for the occurrence rate fit .",
    "this overall @xmath84 is technically consistent with our detection of gj1214b ; the poisson probability of finding 1 or more planets when @xmath88 planets are expected is 19% .",
    "however , the shape of the yield distribution also indicates what kind of planets would be the most probable for mearth to find . in figure",
    "[ f : contours_period ] , gj1214b is set apart from the bulk of the expected yield distribution ; 2.7@xmath0 , 1.6 day planets are exceedingly rare in the _ kepler _  sample .",
    "if the hypothesis that @xmath82 stays the same between mearth and _ kepler _  holds , then the one planet that mearth found should probably have had a longer period than gj1214b , or been a bit smaller .",
    "the agreement is much better if we assume that planet occurrence as function of radius and incident stellar flux ",
    "@xmath85  is the same across stellar samples .",
    "such a scaling is motivated by the dominant role thermal evolution and mass loss likely play in the histories of @xmath2@xmath0  planets @xcite .",
    "figure [ f : contours_temperature ] shows the results if we focus on equilibrium temperature @xmath35 instead of period @xmath29 . because mearth stars are on average cooler and smaller than the _ kepler _  m dwarfs , this has the effect of bringing planets closer in to their host stars , making them easier for mearth to detect . integrating @xmath36 against @xmath85",
    "achieves a total @xmath89 planets / year , in broad agreement with our single discovery in four years .",
    "the peak of the expected yield probability distribution closely matches gj1214b s 2.7@xmath0  radius and 570k equilibrium temperature , unlike the case in figure [ f : contours_period ] .    of the two hypotheses , keeping the planet occurrence distribution fixed as a function of @xmath35 appears to be the better match .",
    "however , both are consistent with mearth finding one planet in our first four years . as surveys like",
    "mearth become more sensitive , it will be possible to make more quantitative statements about the differences that exist between the planet populations around mid - to - late m dwarfs and early m dwarfs . on the main sequence , the m spectral class spans a factor of 5 in stellar mass ( compared to the factor of 2.5 spanned by fgk dwarfs combined ) .",
    "understanding the differences across this range would provide a strong lever arm to probe the environmental dependence of planet formation .",
    "@xcite may have seen hints of such differences within the _ kepler _  sample itself , although their sample of very late m dwarfs is small .",
    "mearth was never designed to be a statistical survey ; it was designed to detect individual systems favorable for follow - up .",
    "we can use the machinery developed in this work to address how to better achieve that goal , how to increase the `` planets / year '' that mearth could find .",
    "_ kepler _  has told us planets are bountiful ; how do we reap the harvest ?",
    "inspection of figures [ f : contours_period ] and [ f : contours_temperature ] suggests that marginal improvement in mearth s ability to detect smaller planets or cooler planets could dramatically increase the survey s yield . in this section ,",
    "we describe changes to the mearth strategy that could exploit this opportunity .",
    "our conclusions may have broad impact for current and future surveys targeting m dwarfs , particularly those such as apache @xcite with designs and strategies similar to mearth s .",
    "how do we increase sensitivity to smaller planets ?",
    "both the equipment and the observing strategy of mearth were tailored toward detecting @xmath68@xmath0  planets . to find smaller planets , we need to gather more photons during transit .",
    "working with the existing mearth observatory , we could achieve this goal either by exposing longer with each telescope during each pointing or by using more telescopes to monitor each star .",
    "the former is dangerous , as systematic noise sources below mearth s current photon noise limit could potentially counteract the benefits of the extra exposure time .",
    "the latter strategy is more compelling . with the exception of a common mode effect introduced by precipitable water vapor @xcite",
    ", many noise sources should be uncorrelated between telescopes , allowing our noise to bin down with the number of telescopes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "increasing the number of telescopes observing each star ( @xmath90 ) decreases the total number of stars that can be observed ( by a factor of @xmath90 ) but also shrinks the minimum detectable planet radius for each ( by @xmath91 ) .",
    "we vary @xmath90 and repeat the calculations in  [ s : gj1214b ] .",
    "we find @xmath92 optimizes the overall @xmath84 , for which a 1.7@xmath0  planet becomes as detectable as a 2@xmath0  planet was originally .",
    "mearth s old sensitivity so closely skirts the cliff in occurrence to make the tradeoff of observing fewer stars more deeply worthwhile . in reality , the @xmath91 scaling is unlikely to hold beyond 23 telescopes .",
    "when pushing to planets smaller than 1.7@xmath0with mearth s instrumentation , our ability to correct for the precipitable water vapor systematic would become a major concern @xcite .",
    "scintillation would also impose a limit for bright stars and shallow depths , although scintillation may be suppressed by the extra baseline of distributing aperture over multiple telescopes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for 1.7@xmath0  planets we consider here ,",
    "transit are deep enough ( 4 millimags for a 0.25@xmath10  star ) that we probably do not yet reach the multiple - telescope scintillation limit .",
    "how do we increase sensitivity to cooler , longer period planets ?",
    "the probability that multiple transits will be observable from the same site within one season shrinks dramatically with increasing periods .",
    "best strategy for longer period planets is to reliably detect planets from single transit events , by using our realtime trigger .",
    "this mode is fully functional ; we have blindly rediscovered single transits of gj1214b at high significance with it .",
    "we did not include simulations of the realtime trigger in the sensitivity estimate in ",
    "[ s : method ] because we have neither yet confirmed a new transiting planet found through the realtime trigger nor followed up on candidate triggered events sufficiently to know they were not real .    here , we consider in more detail what the realtime trigger means for mearth s sensitivity .",
    "we repeat the transit injection simulations of  [ s : method ] in a `` time - machine '' fashion , assessing the significance of a particular transit using only the light curve data up to and including the event . in the miss marple framework , the significance of a transit depends on how well - constrained the priors describing the star s behavior within a night are ; these tighten as more nights of data are gathered ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "also , transits that occur early within a night are less significant than those that occur later , after observations have been gathered to constrain the out - of - transit baseline and the instrumental parameters for the night . in the simulations ,",
    "if a low - cadence transit exceeds a @xmath21 threshold we pretend the trigger would be activated , populate the remaining time left in the transit with high cadence data points , and assess the post - trigger significance .",
    "this is a rough approximation to the actual process that occurs on - sky ( a @xmath93 dip triggers the immediate start of a feedback loop to observe and continually reassess the significance of the candidate event ; if the significance reaches @xmath20 , the star is then observed continuously and unconditionally until an egress is detected or two hours elapse ) . for a threshold , we say that if the post - trigger significance of a single transit exceeds @xmath94 in these simulations , the planet is detected .",
    "this threshold is meant to be conservative , and it set by visual inspection of simulated events and of the histogram of single event statistics within our sample ; it can be lower than the phased @xmath57 threshold because fewer independent hypotheses are being tested against the data ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the simulations show that such a realtime trigger dramatically improves sensitivity to 10 day periods , especially for planets that are signal - to - noise limited in single transits ( essentially everything smaller than neptune ) .    for a planet detected with a single transit",
    ", we will have essentially no knowledge of its orbital period . one way to measure the period would be to continue to monitor the star with mearth .",
    "this is an inefficient strategy , reintroducing the problematic bottleneck that mearth would have to see multiple transits from the same site .",
    "external telescopes providing either continuous photometric monitoring or precise radial velocity observations could measure the period and confirm the planet much more efficiently than mearth could by itself .",
    "the combination of all of these improvements makes mearth more sensitive to smaller , cooler planets .",
    "figure [ f : contours_comparison ] compares mearth s yield distributions for two scenarios , both assuming that @xmath85 is fixed between early and late m dwarfs .",
    "the top is the original phased search yield , the same as in figure [ f : contours_temperature ] .",
    "the bottom is the predicted yield if mearth allocates two telescopes per star and makes full use of the realtime trigger to detect planets with single transits , as described above . because fewer stars would be observed with the multiple telescope strategy , we chose those stars wisely : we explicitly biased the target list toward closer , cooler stars ( those within 20 pc and smaller than @xmath95@xmath10 ) . in both panels of figure",
    "[ f : contours_comparison ] , we include iso - density contours drawn so that the integral over each contour level will enclose a given number of `` planets / year . ''",
    "these contour express the overall normalization of the yield distribution , allowing for direct comparison between the panels . in the original scenario ( top panel ) , the integral over the entire plotted area for the original scenario is @xmath96 planets / year , as it was in ",
    "[ s : gj1214b ] .",
    "in contrast , with the updated scenario ( bottom panel ) , the integral over this parameter space is @xmath97 . simply by revising our operational strategy",
    ", we can increase the expected yield of the survey by a factor of @xmath6 .    ultimately , the choice of whether photometry or radial velocity will provide the most efficient route to planet confirmation for these small , long period candidates will depend on the specifics of the candidate . for context",
    ", a hypothetical candidate might be a 2@xmath0 , 5@xmath9  planet ( corresponding to a density of 3.5 g/@xmath98 ) in a 12 day ( roughly habitable zone ) orbit around a 0.20@xmath10 , 0.15@xmath13  star ( m5 in spectral type ) ; such a planet would create a transit 0.8% deep and impart a stellar wobble with a semiamplitude of 5 m / s .",
    "brute force photometry could recover additional transits and narrow the period to a family of possibilities , allowing subsequent targeted follow - up to characterize the system .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the photometric capabilities required to reacquire 0.8% transits are modest ( comparable to mearth s 40 cm aperture ) ; the disadvantage is the amount of time needed , with many hours required to have a high probability of recovering long - period planet transits . the photometric option could be achieved either with a longitudinally - distributed array of telescopes such as the las cumbres observatory global telescope ( lcogt ) network @xcite or with a coordinated effort across other robotic observatories .    on the other hand , before gathering additional photometry , precise radial velocity monitoring could be used to detect the planet s orbital motion and plan subsequent targeted transit searches .",
    "such radial velocity confirmation would be a departure from the common strategy for transiting planets of planning radial velocity observations near known times of quadrature , and it would require the detection of very small signals : for nearby mid - to - late m dwarfs , 5 m / s is comparable both to the internal errors in 15 minute exposures with the harps spectrograph ( see * ? ? ? * ) and to the astrophysical jitter that can be introduced by starspots ( at optical wavelengths ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the time - correlated structure of this jitter ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) or the presence of multiplanet systems could further complicate the extraction of the candidate planet s signal .",
    "importantly , however , this doppler approach would require much less time than photometry by lifting the necessity that rare transits be observed .",
    "it could potentially be achieved either with the existing harps , harps - n , or hires spectrographs or with the forthcoming near - ir spectrographs carmenes @xcite and hzpf @xcite , which are specifically optimized for observing mid - to - late m dwarfs like mearth s targets .    either way , large investments will be required to confirm mearth s long period , single - transit planet candidates .",
    "such major uses of telescope time are justified because the planets that mearth can find through the above outlined strategy will likely be , for decades to come , the very best targets for atmospheric characterization studies with the james webb space telescope once it launches and the giant segmented mirror telescopes once they are constructed .     but including iso - density contours for quantitative comparison between plots .",
    "two scenarios are shown : that achieved from phase - folded searches of the first four years of observations ( _ top _ ) and that which could be achieved if multiple mearth telescopes observe the same target , planets are reliably detected with single transits , and external facilities can be used to measure their periods .",
