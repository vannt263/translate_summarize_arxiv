    "in spectroscopic studies ionization potential ( ip ) , electron affinity ( ea ) , excitation energy ( ee ) and double ip ( dip ) are important in many aspects . for example , in all kind of electron spectroscopy , including photo - electron and auger the ip , dips always play major roles .",
    "specially , the knowledge of core ip provides insights into the choice and tunability of the ionizing beam in all kinds of electron scattering experiments like @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , double auger decay etc .",
    "these experiments are not only important to understand the physics but also to the development of new fields like quantum computing thorough the idea of entanglement involved in the process .",
    "hence accurate theoretical determination of ip for core as well as valance electrons may give some impetus to the physics underlying in those experiments .    open - shell coupled cluster ( oscc ) method is used since several years to compute the ip , ea @xcite and dips @xcite - usually employing complete model space ( cms ) @xcite . in 1980",
    "s coupled cluster ( cc ) methods have been generalized to handle the incomplete model space ( ims ) @xcite in a size - extensive manner . in this paper",
    "we have tried to demonstrate the results arising from the algebraic structure of the expansion of the wave operator @xmath4 .",
    "we have used both the ordinary and normal ordered cluster expansion of the wave operator @xmath0 .",
    "normally the operator @xmath5 corresponds to core - correlation .",
    "lindgren @xcite has shown how the normal ordered cluster expansion of the wave operator @xmath0 can include the correlation effects . here",
    "we will show in a sophisticated way how the relaxation effects , the many - body effect of different kind can also be taken into account in the calculation of ionization potential within the algebraic structure of the semi - normal ordered cluster expansion of the wave operator @xmath0 .",
    "the form of the cluster expansion takes care the relaxation effect in a compact and efficient manner and it can be easily demonstrated how the coupling of different many body effects like relaxation and correlation effects come into the picture automatically . in an earlier publication chaudhuri _",
    "@xcite have explored this techniques and applied to molecules .    in this paper",
    "we have calculated ionization potentials ( ips ) of different states of ne , ar and kr . ips are calculated for core and valance orbitals of those closed shell atoms using two different approaches .",
    "section [ theory ] deals with the theoretical formulation of the two different methods of calculation using the @xmath6 and @xmath7 theories respectively , where @xmath8 denotes normal ordering .",
    "section [ results ] presents the results obtained from our calculation and a detailed discussion about the physical aspects of the two theories . in section [ concl ]",
    "we have made the concluding remarks and the important findings of our calculations .",
    "it is a well established fact that the orbital relaxation effects are more important than the correlation effects in the core hole ionization ( chi ) process . since in chi",
    "the relaxation effects are stronger than the correlation effects , perturbative treatment will not be a efficient one because in higher orders it will be very cumbersome and that is the reason to choose the non - perturbative approach like cc .",
    "let us start from the @xmath9-electron dirac fock ( df ) determinant @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath11 ionized determinants @xmath12 are obtained from the df reference state where one electron is ionized from the orbital @xmath13 . here",
    "the labels @xmath14 denote holes and @xmath15 denote particles . according to thouless@xcite , the orbital relaxation corrections can be introduced through an exponential transformation involving one body operator of the form : @xmath16 where @xmath17 provided @xmath18 the amplitudes @xmath19 can be uniquely determined and orbital relaxation effects may be induced through the above exponential transformation . like eq.([eq1 ] ) , @xmath20 , the combination of the determinantal states @xmath21 also transforms in a similar way and we have the new function having modified determinant with the associated modified orbital set for each determinant . we write it as @xmath22 with @xmath23 where @xmath24 s are the coefficients of @xmath25 and the @xmath26 s are the projectors onto the @xmath27 .",
    "now our aim is to define an expansion which is analogous to eq.([eq4 ] ) .",
    "to do so , we introduce a valence universal wave operator @xmath0 @xcite for both neutral and the ( n-1 ) electron ionized model space states , satisfying the fock - space bloch equations @xcite@xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the projectors onto @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "we invoke a _",
    "normal ordered _ exponential ansatz @xcite for @xmath0 as @xmath33 that satisfies @xmath34 the cluster operators @xmath5 and @xmath35 appearing in eq.([eq7 ] ) are defined as @xmath36 and @xmath37 here @xmath38 denotes normal ordering with respect to @xmath31 . due to the normal",
    "ordering , @xmath35 acting on @xmath27 will give zero unless the determinantal state has a hole in @xmath13 .",
    "for convenience , we express the cluster operator @xmath35 in terms of correlation ( @xmath39 ) and relaxation ( @xmath40 ) operator as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 figures ( [ fig-1]a)-([fig-1]b ) represent the hugenholtz diagrams corresponding to the terms given in eq.([eq12 ] ) and figure ( [ fig-2]b ) represents eq.([eq13 ] ) for @xmath44 .",
    "since @xmath45 and higher powers of @xmath35 contains more than one valence destruction operator @xmath46 and contraction among @xmath35 operators is not allowed , eq.([eq7 ] ) reduces to @xmath47 it is evident from eq.([eq14 ] ) that @xmath48 can not induce relaxation corrections via thouless - type exponentiation .",
    "let us now consider expansion of @xmath0 where @xmath0 is an ordinary exponential ansatz , i.e. , @xmath49 substituting eq.([eq11 ] ) in eq.([eq15 ] ) , we get @xmath50.\\label{eq16}\\ ] ] this expansion looks similar to the normal ordered expansion with the extra property that the contractions like @xmath51 involving the orbital @xmath13 is allowed .",
    "it can easily shown that in the above expression ( eq.[eq16 ] ) , terms like @xmath52 , @xmath53 etc .",
    "do not contribute because these terms contain more than one valence destruction operator @xmath46 .",
    "introducing an operator @xmath54 through the relation @xmath55 we can rewrite eq.([eq16 ] ) in normal order as @xmath56 eq.([eq18 ] ) clearly indicates that the ordinary exponential ansatz @xmath6 is capable of inducing the orbital relaxation effects through thouless - type exponentiation .",
    "the relaxation effects arising from the contraction of terms like @xmath51 are shown in figure [ fig-2 ] where in ( [ fig-2]a ) @xmath57 and in figure ( [ fig-2]b ) @xmath58 .    to compute the energy difference",
    ", we insert eq.([eq14])/eq.([eq18 ] ) into eq.([eq6 ] ) and proceed hierarchically from @xmath59 to @xmath60 . for @xmath59 , eq.([eq6 ] ) reduces to closed shell cc equation for core - cluster amplitudes @xmath5 . for @xmath60 , we premultiply eq.([eq6 ] ) by @xmath61 , introduce a connected dressed operator @xmath62 and obtain the bloch equation for energy difference @xmath63 where @xmath64     hugenholtz type diagrams to show the relaxation effects ]    diagrammatic representation of the cluster operator @xmath35 ]",
    "the results obtained by our calculation of ips of ne , ar and kr using two different approaches are presented in table [ ip - table ] .",
    "figures [ ip - ne ] , [ ip - ar ] and [ ip - kr ] show the relative error for all the states of ne , ar and kr respectively , where as the figure [ ip-1s ] shows the relative error in ip for @xmath66 states explicitly of the systems studied . from table",
    "[ ip - table ] and figures [ ip - ne ] , [ ip - ar ] and [ ip - kr ] it is clear that the agreement of ips obtained by the @xmath6 theory is better than @xmath7 theory for the core states .",
    "this nature can be interpreted in terms of the different many - body effects , namely relaxation and correlation effects . for deep lying cores ,",
    "the relaxation effects are stronger than the correlation effects , which is taken care of by the @xmath6 theory as compared to the @xmath7 theory ( fig.[fig-1 ] , [ fig-2 ] ) . where as for high - lying core orbitals the relaxation effects are comparatively less than the deep core orbitals like @xmath67 and @xmath68 . and thus the results obtained by the @xmath7 theory performs better than the @xmath6 theory for high lying states like @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "these can be interpreted in a better way if we look at the thouless s",
    "treatment @xcite .",
    "when the relaxation is very strong , a perturbative treatment is very cumbersome in higher orders and also inefficient .",
    "the widely used normal ordered cluster expansion approach is not compact enough to include the relaxation effects in an adequate manner in the theories to calculate ip , ea , ee and dip . to overcome this problem",
    "we have explored the generalized thouless s treatment and have calculated the results by using the @xmath6 theory .",
    ".[ip - table]ionization potentials ( in ev ) of ne , ar and kr atoms .",
    "entries within parentheses are from ucc(3 ) . [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     in table [ ip - table ]",
    "the results in the parentheses are obtained from ucc(3 ) and it is clear that for these kind of problem the introduction of the unitary excitation operator does not improve the results much .",
    "the details and the results using ucc(3 ) @xcite will be communicated shortly .",
    "if we minutely observe the results for kr we can see that the relaxation and correlation effects are canceled out for almost all the states . in other words , these two effects are compensated by each other .",
    "this becomes more clear if we see the koopman s energy for this system given in table [ ip - table ] .    besides the experimental values , ips from @xmath71-scf",
    "are also listed in table [ ip - table ] .",
    "the @xmath71-scf ips are computed using grasp programme @xcite . in this procedure",
    ", the electron binding energy corresponds to the @xmath13th orbital is obtained from    @xmath72    where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the scf energies of @xmath9 and @xmath11-electron systems respectively .",
    "the present calculation shows that @xmath71-scf estimates the core ip more accurately than the valence ip .",
    "this is in accordance with our expectation .",
    "note that the differential electron correlation which is important for valence ip can not be incorporated through @xmath71-scf procedure .",
    "since the orbital relaxation effect can be introduced through @xmath71-scf procedure , this yield reasonably accurate core ips .",

    "in this paper we have presented the calculation of ionization potentials for core and valance orbitals of some rare gas atoms , namely ne , ar and kr . we have explored both the @xmath6 and @xmath7 theory to obtain the results .",
    "along with the normal cluster expansion ansatz we have also obtained the results by using unitary cluster operator theory ( ucc ) for both the formalisms .    the close comparison between the results obtained by the two different approaches are explored and discussed in details .",
    "the figures containing the computational errors for different theories help us to understand the trends of the obtained results .",
