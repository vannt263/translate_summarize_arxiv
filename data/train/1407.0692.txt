    "a material is crystalline if its underlying atomic structure comprises a ( multi)-lattice of particles .",
    "it is known , through techniques such as x - ray diffraction , that most materials crystallize when at a sufficiently low temperature . whilst the range of crystalline materials is vast , however , the number of underlying atomic structures is relatively small .",
    "for example , more than half of the metals crystallize into a face - centered cubic lattice ( fcc ) , a hexagonal - close packed crystal lattice ( hcp ) or a body - centered cubic lattice ( bcc ) .",
    "the question of why lattices are ubiquitous in nature can be reformulated mathematically : why is it the case that so many energy functionals admit periodic minimizers ?",
    "the premise of this paper is to provide a reasonably large set of energy functionals @xmath5 which are invariant under translations and rotations and permutations for which the optimality of unique periodic ( lattice ) configurations can be rigorously proven in the many particle limit @xmath6",
    ". of course uniqueness of the optimal lattice only holds up to translations and rotations .",
    "we will focus on cases where where the optimal lattice @xmath7 is given by the fcc lattice @xmath8 where @xmath9  @xmath10 and @xmath11 are column vectors .    to our best knowledge ,",
    "the first three - dimensional examples for which the existence of periodic minimizers can be guaranteed are due to a.  suto , @xcite .",
    "the results provide the existence of pair interaction potentials which admit periodic ground states .",
    "however , the potentials are very delocalized resulting in a significantly degenerate behavior of the ground states : every periodic configuration with a sufficiently high density is a minimizer .",
    "our results are concerned with localized potentials where the strength of the interaction between pairs of particles decays with an inverse power law as a function of the distance . as a consequence",
    "we obtain that the minimum energy per particle converges to the energy of the fcc lattice as the number of particle tends to infinity .",
    "the assumption that the potentials are localized induces a natural splitting of the interaction energy into three separate contributions : short - range , medium - range and long - range interaction energies .",
    "the analysis of pure short - range models has a long history in discrete geometry .",
    "this approach was first discussed by kepler @xcite , who suggested that the six - fold symmetry of snowflakes could be explained by considering ice to be composed of small balls of vapor , packed together in planes in the tightest way possible . in two dimensions , this tightest",
    "packing is an arrangement of discs whose centers are placed at the points of a triangular lattice .",
    "such an arrangement clearly exhibits the six - fold symmetry of a snowflake .",
    "a refinement of these geometric ideas allows the construction of compactly supported potentials for which it can be shown that minimizers are translated , rotated and dilated subsets of the triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "a more detailed analysis in @xcite even provides a complete characterization of the surface energy and a proof that after rescaling the minimizers converge to the wulff shape as @xmath4 tends to infinity .    in three dimensions",
    "the situation is significantly more involved .",
    "in particular , for pure short - range models , it can not be expected that minimizers are necessarily periodic .",
    "illustrative examples are the theorems by hales @xcite and schtte and van der waerden @xcite .",
    "the results show that _ close - packed structures _ , and in particular fcc or hcp , solve both the densest packing problem and the kissing problem in three dimensions .",
    "the close - packed structures are constructed as follows : consider a triangular arrangement of spheres of diameter @xmath12 in a two - dimensional plane @xmath13 .",
    "now add a translated copy @xmath14 so that each sphere of b sits directly above a hole of @xmath15 .",
    "for the third layer @xmath16 , there are two possibilities : either @xmath17 and @xmath16 lies directly above @xmath15 ; or @xmath18 and each sphere of c sits directly above a hole of both @xmath15 and @xmath19 . in the first instance , we relabel @xmath20 by repeating this stacking construction we obtain a close - packed structure .",
    "the fcc lattice and hcp lattice are defined to be the close - packed structures with stacking sequences @xmath21 or @xmath22 respectively .",
    "this definition of fcc is equivalent to ( [ eq : fccdefn ] ) , whilst hcp is a multi - lattice which is generated by the basis @xmath23 and a translation vector @xmath24 in the sense that @xmath25      [ fig : threelayers ]    for our purposes , the most relevant property of the close - packed structures is that they maximize the number of nearest neighbors to every point in the packing , i.e. they solve the kissing problem .",
    "it has been known since 1953 that the solution of the three - dimensional kissing problem is twelve @xcite , and therefore these maximal neighborhoods each contain twelve points . in our analysis , it is this common feature of the close - packed structures that makes them the most natural candidates for crystallization .",
    "the degeneracy of purely local models regarding the crystalline structure is broken by the presence of long range interactions which occur naturally in physically relevant situations @xcite .",
    "the main result of this paper is theorem [ thm : mainintro ] , which states the existence of a large set of rotation and translation - invariant interaction potentials @xmath26 with the property that the ground states behave asymptotically like an fcc lattice energy , as the number of particles tends to infinity .",

    "the role of the three - body potential @xmath41 is of solely a technical nature .",
    "it is quite likely that the assumptions of theorem  [ thm : mainintro ] can be relaxed so that also pure pair models are covered , ( see the discussion in section  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",

    "the invariance ( [ eq : inv ] ) implies that @xmath53 is equivariant , @xmath63 the choice @xmath64 and @xmath65 delivers the equation @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "a more general discussion of equivariant maps can be found in @xcite , here we only present a self - contained proof of this rather simple example .",

    "the differences affect both the analysis of the local interactions and the analysis of the long - range interactions .",

    "to differentiate between the fcc and the hcp lattice it is unavoidable to consider medium - range interactions whose range reaches beyond nearest neighbors .",
