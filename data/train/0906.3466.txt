    "the concept of derived categories has been introduced by grothendieck and developed further by verdier .",

    "observe that flag varieties for @xmath5 , and toric varieties are special cases of such quotient varieties .",
    "the answer to king s conjecture is negative in general .",
    "hille and perling gave in @xcite an example of a toric variety ( @xmath6 blown - up successively three times ) with the property that it does not admit a tilting object formed by line bundles .",
    "however it is still a very interesting problem to find classes of examples for which the conjecture holds . in the paper @xcite ,",
    "altmann and hille proved the existence of ( partial ) strong exceptional sequences on toric varieties arising from thin representations of quivers , but their construction gives sequences of very short length .",
    "the goal of this paper is to give further examples of strong exceptional sequences of vector bundles over certain fano varieties .",
    "the varieties considered in this paper are obtained as geometric quotients of open subsets of affine spaces by linear actions of a reductive groups .    for the comfort of the reader , we recall that a sequence of vector bundles @xmath7 over a variety @xmath8 is called _ strongly exceptional _ if the following two conditions are fulfilled :    1 .   @xmath9 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "a _ tilting sequence _ is a strongly exceptional sequence @xmath7 with the property that @xmath12 generate @xmath13 .",

    "we denote @xmath19 the weight of the @xmath15-module @xmath20 .",

    "@xmath23 , and @xmath15 acts freely on the semi - stable locus @xmath24 .",
    "we denote @xmath25 the invariant quotient .",
    "the main ingredient that we use for constructing exceptional sequences over @xmath8 is the set @xmath26 of ` extremal ' nef vector bundles over @xmath8 ( see section [ sct : nef - vb ] ) .",
    "they enjoy good cohomology vanishing properties which are required by the definition of exceptional sequences .",
    "the first main result of this paper is the following :    the estimates appearing in this theorem are not strong enough to recover kapranov s construction for partial flag varieties .",
    "we have to go on , and exploit the fibre bundle structure .",
    "the optimal result would be the following :    * consider a fibre bundle @xmath27 .",
    "suppose that @xmath28 is a strong exceptional sequence of vector bundles on @xmath0 , and that @xmath29 is a sequence of vector bundles on @xmath8 whose restriction to the fibres of @xmath30 give rise to strong exceptional sequences relative to @xmath30 .",
    "then @xmath31 is a strong exceptional sequence on @xmath8 .",
    "unfortunately such a statement is overoptimistic in general .",
    "the content of our second main result is that the statement above becomes true under suitable restrictive hypotheses on the fibration @xmath30 .",
    "more precisely , we place ourselves in the following framework :    1",
    ".   there is a quotient group @xmath32 of @xmath15 with kernel @xmath33 , and a quotient @xmath32-module @xmath34 of @xmath18 with kernel @xmath35 , such that the natural projection @xmath36 has the following property : + @xmath37 + we denote by @xmath27 the induced morphism at the quotient level .",
    "the unstable loci have codimension at least two , and both quotients + @xmath38 and @xmath39 + are principal bundles .",
    "the nef cone of the total space @xmath8 is the sum of the nef cones of the base @xmath0 , and that of the fibre : @xmath40 .",
    "denote @xmath41 and @xmath42 the corresponding sets of extremal nef vector bundles .",
    "the maximal torus @xmath43 has exactly @xmath44 weights on @xmath35 .",
    "our main result in the relative case is the following :    we point out that in both cases it _ remains open _ the question under which hypothesis these sequences are / extend to _ tilting _ objects .",
    "however , we remark that , taking into account the example constructed in @xcite , a _ general answer _ concerning the ( non-)existence of tilting vector bundles over quotients of affine spaces must be involved .",
    "the definition of an exceptional set involves two conditions .",
    "accordingly , the paper is divided in two main parts , each focusing on one of the two conditions :     the sections [ sct : stability ] and [ sct : conseq - stab ] form the first part : we prove a stability result for associated vector bundles , and define an order on the set of irreducible @xmath15-modules for which there are no homomorphisms from a ` larger ' vector bundle into a ` smaller ' one ( see theorem [ thm : h000 ] ) .     the sections [ numer - crit ] , [ sct : nef - vb ] and [ cohom - nef ] , have a preparatory character : we introduce the ` extremal ' nef vector bundles , and study their cohomological properties .    ",
    "the second part of the article consists of the sections [ sct : main ] and [ sct : main2 ] : they contain the proofs of the main results .",
    "the main tool used for proving the vanishing of the higher cohomology groups is a result due to manivel ( see @xcite ) , and arapura ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , this general result is not sufficient to address the relative case , and we have to dwell on our particular context . in theorem [ thm : direct - image ] we prove the following nefness property , which is an essential ingredient in the proof of theorem b.     finally , in section [ sct : expl ] , we illustrate the general theory . on one hand , we recover kapranov s construction for the grassmannian and for flag varieties , by using our results . on the other hand ,",
    "we give further examples of strong exceptional sequences over quiver varieties .",
    "the very pleasant feature is that we obtain these example by an almost algorithmic procedure , which applies to any quiver variety .",
