    "it has now been firmly established that the order parameter @xmath2 in homogeneous cuprate superconductors has a @xmath3-wave symmetry @xcite .",
    "it follows that inhomogeneities can scatter quasiparticles between directions that experience opposite signs of @xmath2 .",
    "this effect is strongest at a specularly reflecting ( 110 ) surface , because @xmath2 changes sign along each quasiclassical trajectory upon reflection ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . as a consequence of the atiyah - patodi - singer index theorem @xcite , the andreev equation along each such trajectory has in its spectrum a bound state at exactly zero energy , irrespective of the detailed shape of the potential @xcite . collectively , these states then make up a peak in the tunneling spectra , which has been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "5 mm    it was predicted theoretically @xcite and confirmed experimentally @xcite that below a certain temperature of the order of 1k , this peak of the zero - bias states ( zbss ) splits . the theoretical interpretation of this splitting is that via a sub - dominant pairing interaction of a different symmetry , say @xmath4 , a subdominant order parameter is induced close to the surface .",
    "it is phase - shifted by @xmath5 relative to the dominant @xmath3-wave , which gives the total order parameter `` @xmath6 '' symmetry and indicates broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the full self - consistent calculations in the eilenberger formalism that are based on this interpretation @xcite are in a good quantitative agreement with the experimental data .",
    "however , the mechanism of the transition is not manifest in the numerical solutions of the eilenberger equations .",
    "we believe that understanding of the basic physics of the @xmath7 transition is especially needed now in light of recent experiments that call this interpretation into question @xcite .",
    "that is the purpose of the work presented in this paper .",
    "below , we show by a simple argument based on first - order perturbation theory that the degrees of freedom driving the @xmath7 transition are the zbss , and that we can neglect the effect of all the remaining states .",
    "hence , to understand the mechanism of the transition , we have to deal only with the zbss , which is convenient since these states are least sensitive to the unknown surface details .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ 2 ] , we demonstrate our strategy on the familiar case of bcs instability .",
    "the main argument is presented in section [ 3 ] after we have extended the bcs formalism to inhomogeneous systems and non-@xmath4-wave pairing .",
    "based on this argument , we calculate @xmath2 at @xmath8 in section [ 4 ] and estimate the transition temperature to the @xmath6 state in section [ 5 ] . in section [ 6 ] , we discuss the surface current . finally , we discuss our results in section [ 7 ] .",
    "there are various ways to consider the energetic costs and benefits of the transition to the superfluid state .",
    "the one that has proven useful in our study of the @xmath7 transition is to decouple the attractive four - fermion interaction by the hubbard - stratonovich ( hs ) transformation , and to make a saddle - point ( mean - field ) approximation . that way , we break up the total free energy of the system into free energy of single particle states , which is lowered by the gap @xmath2 , and the extra term from the hs transformation , which grows ( quadratically ) with @xmath2 . we then see that at small enough @xmath9 , the system favors transition to the superfluid state",
    ".    we will demonstrate this on the familiar bcs case .",
    "the model hamiltonian is or a minus sign with positive @xmath10 , we use @xmath11 which is unambiguously positive . ]",
    "@xmath12 which gives rise to the partition function @xmath13},\\ ] ] where the @xmath14 s are now @xmath15dependent grassmann numbers .",
    "we perform the hs transformation by multiplying the partition function by the ( infinite ) constant @xmath16 so @xmath17 where @xmath18,\\ ] ] where we defined @xmath19 from the action ( [ action ] ) , we can read off that in the mean - field approximation , the total free energy of the system is @xmath20 upon minimization with respect to @xmath21 .",
    "here , @xmath22 and @xmath23    we see the instability most clearly at @xmath8 , where @xmath24 .",
    "then @xmath25 so @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the density of states at the fermi level , and @xmath28 is the debye frequency .",
    "direct calculation shows that the integral behaves as @xmath29 for @xmath30 , whose non - analytic decrease will win over the analytic increase of the second term for small enough @xmath2 , no matter how weak the attractive interaction @xmath11 is . by the same calculation",
    ", we can also see that the integral becomes analytic if we do not integrate @xmath31 all the way up to zero , but to a finite negative energy .",
    "this means that the states close to the fermi energy drive the bcs transition  they benefit most from opening of the gap @xmath32 . similarly , we shall see that the states at zero energy , that is the zbss , will drive the @xmath7 transition .",
    "so far , the argument has shown the bcs instability only at @xmath8 . at finite temperatures , @xmath33 which , upon expansion in powers of @xmath34 , gives @xmath35 this shows that the system is unstable to the bcs transition at temperatures below @xmath36 that satisfies @xmath37 in a similar way",
    ", we shall see below that @xmath38 , the transition temperature into the @xmath6 state , is finite .",
    "we now need to develop the formalism that will enable us to extend the strategy from section [ 2 ] to the @xmath6 case .",
    "we shall consider a single ( 2-dimensional ) cuo plane , and model it by the hamiltonian @xmath39 where @xmath31 is the band energy and @xmath10 is the short - range interaction responsible for pairing .",
    "what makes this difficult problem tractable is the separation of energy scales ( the fermi energy @xmath40 is much bigger than the superconducting gap @xmath2 ) , which gives rise to separation of length scales @xmath41 ( fermi wave length ) and @xmath42 ( the coherence length ) .",
    "we may , therefore , expand in powers of the small parameter @xmath43 ; keeping the lowest non - trivial order is called the quasiclassical approximation .",
    "this procedure is usually done at the level of green s function @xcite , which are thus transformed into eilenberger functions that satisfy transport - like equations .",
    "since we want to understand the @xmath7 transition in terms of quasiparticle eigenstates rather than green s functions , we will perform this separation of scales at the operator level instead .",
    "we denote as @xmath44 the width of the shell around the fermi surface containing the states that take part in the pairing ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . we then factor out the fast fermi - surface oscillations and define the slowly varying field operator @xmath45 @xcite by @xmath46 5 mm    when we substitute this into ( [ fullham ] ) , we obtain @xmath47 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the fermi velocity at the point @xmath49 , and @xmath50 the derivation of ( [ qcham ] ) is given in appendix a. note the linearized kinetic energy in ( [ qcham ] ) , which will be crucial in the following .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ qcham ] ) gives rise to a partition function , which we can write as a path integral over the fermion fields @xmath45 .",
    "we can again decompose the interaction by the hs transformation , _ i.e. _ , we can multiply the partition function by the constant @xmath51.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the mean - field approximation , the total free energy of the system equals the free energy given by the ( single - particle ) hamiltonian @xmath52,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] upon minimization with respect to @xmath53 , where we defined @xmath54 we shall write explicit formulae for the total energy and free energy in sections [ 4 ] and [ 5 ] ( formulae ( [ efunc ] ) and ( [ f ] ) ) . here",
    "we just note that to calculate the single - particle contribution to the free energy , we will have to find the spectra of the andreev hamiltonians labeled by @xmath55 , _",
    "i.e. _ , we will need the energies @xmath56 that satisfy @xcite @xmath57 we note that the linear kinetic energy in ( [ qcham ] ) makes this equation effectively one - dimensional , _",
    "i.e. _ , an independent equation for each line in the direction @xmath48 . in the presence of the specularly reflecting boundary , we must find the andreev spectra along reflected lines such as the one in fig .",
    "equivalently , we solve the equation on a straight line with the pairing potential @xmath2 shown in fig .",
    "this is intuitively obvious ; a derivation is given in appendix b.    as we mentioned in the introduction , the spectrum along each trajectory having opposite signs of @xmath2 at the two asymptotic ends will contain a zero - bias state .",
    "its wave function is , up to a normalization constant , @xmath58 where the upper ( lower ) sign corresponds to @xmath59 , @xmath60 ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) , so that the wave function is normalizable . in our notation , we will freely interchange the dependence on @xmath63 ( actually only on @xmath64 , since the system is translationally invariant in the @xmath65-direction ) with the dependence on the angle @xmath55 and the coordinate @xmath66 along the trajectory .",
    "their relationship is obvious from fig . 1 .",
    "we now have all the tools needed to demonstrate the @xmath6 transition in a way that brings out its physical mechanism .",
    "we follow the same line of thought as in section [ 2 ] : we go to the zero temperature , and look at the energy gains and losses when the @xmath4-wave component of @xmath2 appears .    for",
    "any @xmath4-wave pairing to appear , it is necessary that the part of the functional integral ( [ hsconst ] ) over the @xmath4-component of @xmath67 converge , _",
    "i.e. _ , that @xmath10 on top of the dominant @xmath3-wave attraction contain also an @xmath4-wave part , rather than @xmath68 . ] @xmath69 in this subsection , we will show that this condition is also sufficient : at zero temperature , the system will favor the @xmath6 state for an arbitrarily weak attraction @xmath68 .    with both @xmath3- and @xmath4-wave pairing present , @xmath70 ( the @xmath4-components of both @xmath10 and @xmath67 are angle - independent .",
    ") we begin with the second term in ( [ mfham ] ) , which then is @xmath71 where we used the orthogonality of the @xmath4 and @xmath3 components : @xmath72 we can also split up ( [ defdelta ] ) into components and define @xmath73 the @xmath3-component of @xmath2 was established well above @xmath38 , so the change of the second term in ( [ mfham ] ) due to the opening of a ( small ) @xmath4-wave gap will be @xmath74 just as in the bcs case .",
    "due to the translational invariance in the @xmath65-direction , we will from now on write @xmath75 . along the quasiclassical trajectory",

    "we notice several things by looking at ( [ ebs ] ) :    @xmath86 it depends only on @xmath87 , since @xmath88 just changes the position of the node in the total @xmath89 , in which case the bound state remains at zero energy .",
    "hence , we will assume @xmath90 , and write @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath86 @xmath92 $ ] is non - zero due to the form of the bound - state wave function ( [ upperlower ] ) and due to the fact that @xmath93 does not change sign along the quasiclassical trajectory ( by virtue of the @xmath4-symmetry ) . out of the two possibilities for the sign of @xmath4",
    ", we will choose @xmath94 in the following , which means all the @xmath84-moving states are shifted up in energy , whereas the @xmath85-moving states are shifted down .",
    "since we are at zero temperature , only the states that move down from zero energy will be occupied .",
    "we can then argue similarly as in the bcs case : opening of the additional @xmath4-wave gap costs the system energy @xmath95 ( from ( [ scondens ] ) ) but the quasiparticles save energy @xmath96 . the lowering of the quasiparticle energy is only linear in @xmath4 , @xmath97 , not as dramatic as the non - analytic decrease in the bcs case , but nevertheless it beats the quadratic increase for small enough @xmath4 .",
    "thus , for an arbitrarily small but non - zero interaction @xmath98 , @xmath99 can not be a minimum of the total energy , and the additional @xmath4-wave gap phase shifted by @xmath5 from the @xmath3-wave gap will appear . from the formula ( [ ebs ] ) , we see that the superconductor will benefit from opening up the gap only close to the surface where @xmath100 is effectively non - zero , so the transition into the @xmath6 state is a surface effect .",
    "the decay into the bulk will be discussed more quantitatively in the next section .",
    "we should also note that the remaining states on the quasiclassical trajectories do not change this situation , that is , they do not contribute linearly to the change of the total quasiparticle energy .",
    "due to the time - reversal symmetry in the pure @xmath3-wave state , every state on a given quasiclassical trajectory corresponds to a state of the same energy on a reversed trajectory .",
    "indeed , if we label the coordinate along the trajectory reversed to the one in ( [ dandreev ] ) as @xmath101 , then the hamiltonian on the reversed trajectory is @xmath102 since @xmath103 , so @xmath104 will also have energy @xmath105 . now",
    "( [ deltaen ] ) implies that to the first order , a small @xmath87 will shift the energies of the two corresponding states by an equal amount with opposite signs .",
    "hence , the only way they can linearly contribute to the total energy at @xmath8 is when one of them crosses zero and thus changes its occupancy , which happens only when their original energy ( in absolute value ) is smaller than the @xmath4-wave gap .",
    "but as @xmath106 , there will be fewer and fewer such states in smaller and smaller neighborhoods of the @xmath3-wave nodes .",
    "it is only the zbss that change their occupancy for arbitrarily small @xmath4 .",
    "we thus conclude that the onset of the transition into the @xmath6 state is driven by these states .",
    "in the study of the instability of the pure @xmath3 state in the last section , we used first - order perturbation theory since @xmath106 at the onset of @xmath6 .",
    "now we will argue that this theory holds up to the the actual value of @xmath4 , @xmath97 @xmath107 . as we will show in section [ 5 ] , @xmath108 , the transition temperature into the @xmath6 state . because @xmath38 @xmath109 k , it is much smaller than @xmath110 , the superconducting transition temperature of the order of 100k , which sets the scale for @xmath111 .",
    "figure 3 shows the magnitude of the two gaps as a function of angle around a quarter of the fermi surface .",
    "we see that the required inequality @xmath107 holds for most of the fermi surface except for small neighborhoods of the nodes .",
    "first - order perturbation theory certainly breaks down there , but upon averaging over the fermi surface , the nodes will only introduce an error of the order @xmath112 .",
    "thus , we will use that theory to obtain @xmath113 at @xmath8 . as discussed at the end of subsection [",
    "argument ] , first - order perturbation theory implies that we have to look only at the zero - energy states .",
    "also , since @xmath4 is a small perturbation , we shall neglect its effect on @xmath111 .",
    "5 mm    now we can write down the energy due to @xmath4 per unit length of the surface ( the @xmath65-direction ) as a functional of @xmath113 : @xmath114= \\int\\limits _ 0^{+\\infty } dx { s^2(x ) \\over |v_s| } + \\int\\limits _ { \\theta \\epsilon ( -\\pi /2,0 ) } { dk_f(\\theta ) \\over 2\\pi } e_{\\theta } [ s(\\theta , \\rho ) ] \\cos \\theta , \\ ] ] where @xmath115 $ ] is given by ( [ ebs ] ) ; for the rest of this section , we shall drop the superscript `` ( 1 ) '' , since we shall be using only the first - order formula .",
    "we freely interchange @xmath113 for @xmath93 ; the relation between the two is discussed below ( [ scondens ] ) .",
    "note the correct dimensions : the @xmath64-integration makes @xmath116 from energy per unit area into energy per unit length .",
    "in the second term , the integrand is energy and the dimension of the measure is @xmath117 , @xmath97 , inverse length .",
    "the extra factor of @xmath118 in the second integral accounts for the difference of the density of trajectories along the @xmath65-direction compared to their angle - independent intrinsic density ( measured perpendicularly to their direction ) , as shown in fig .",

    "we should note here that @xmath80 is absent on the right - hand side of ( [ sgapeqn ] ) , so the gap equation in this case ( unlike in the bcs theory ) is an explicit formula for the gap .",
    "the physical reason for this is that @xmath113 is considered small , so we neglect the change of the bound - state wave functions due to its presence .",
    "the only effect of @xmath113 we are taking into account is the change of the occupancy of the zero - energy states , which , by ( [ ebs ] ) , depends only on the sign of @xmath4 , not on its detailed shape .",

    "the total current density therefore is @xmath189 according to ( [ jasymp ] ) , the current is localized within the distance @xmath190 from the surface , which is much smaller than @xmath191 , the in - plane penetration depth , because the cuprates are strongly type-2 superconductors .",
    "hence , the diamagnetic response does not resolve the internal structure of @xmath192 , and we can estimate @xmath193 5 mm    the surface current will be screened completely , because the magnetic field it induces is smaller than @xmath194 , the lower critical field in the @xmath14-direction .",
    "indeed , even if the current flows in the same direction along all the cuo planes ( as shown in fig .",
    "7 ) , the magnetic field at distances @xmath195 ( the interplane spacing @xmath196 ) from the surface will be @xmath197 which is smaller by an order of magnitude than @xmath194 for ybco ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the complete screening implies @xmath198 which together with ( [ agreement ] ) gives @xmath199 for @xmath187 we can approximate the exponential in ( [ jdm ] ) by 1 , so @xmath200.\\ ] ] this changes sign at distance @xmath201 where @xmath202 is the ginzburg - landau parameter . due to the one - third power , @xmath203 for reasonable values of @xmath204 ( say , between 50 and 500 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the numerical results @xcite .",
    "note that the two calculations of the surface current agree ( see ( [ agreement ] ) ) because the zbss moving in the direction of the current are shifted down in energy and thus occupied , whereas those moving against the current are shifted up and unoccupied .",
    "we wish to stress that this is exactly * opposite * to the sign of the doppler shift : the states moving along the current would be doppler - shifted up , whereas those moving against the current would be doppler - shifted down .",
    "this point is further supported by the analogy between the zbss and low - lying excitations in a core of an @xmath4-wave vortex .",
    "we consider an idealized case : @xmath205 inside the vortex ( at distances from the center smaller than @xmath206 ) , and @xmath207 outside with the phase winding counterclockwise once around .",
    "we look at a quasiclassical trajectory passing close to the center of the vortex .",
    "we denote the coordinate along the trajectory as @xmath66 again and the phase at the intersection point with the vortex edge as @xmath208 , see fig .",
    "then the energy of a low - lying excitation moving from @xmath209 to @xmath210 on that trajectory is @xcite @xmath211_{mod \\",
    "2\\pi}.\\ ] ] for a trajectory passing through the center , @xmath212 , so @xmath213 , and the low - lying excitation is a zbs .",
    "if we now shift the trajectory slightly to the left as shown in fig .",
    "8 , then @xmath214 and @xmath215 . in a real vortex",
    ", @xmath2 would be non - zero even inside , and the phase of @xmath2 would wind clockwise as we go from @xmath209 to @xmath210 , so we are going against the current .",
    "moreover , @xmath216 , so @xmath2 behaves the same way as in fig . 6 .",
    "hence , the @xmath0 transition is analogous to shifting the quasiclassical trajectory away from the vortex center . in both cases ,",
    "the zbs will have a positive energy if it is moving against the current and negative energy if it is moving in the direction of the current .",
    "in order to understand the basic physical mechanism of the @xmath7 transition , we considered the change of the free energy of a cuo half - plane when an @xmath4-wave component of @xmath2 appears close to the 110 surface . by the hubbard - stratonovich transformation and the mean - field approximation",
    ", we decomposed the total free energy into the contribution from the single - particle states , which is decreased by i m @xmath80 , and the hs term , which increases quadratically with @xmath80 .",
    "using first - order perturbation theory , we saw that the system favors the @xmath6 state at @xmath8 , and that the transition is driven by the zero - bias states .",
    "based on this argument and on the separation of energy scales associated with the @xmath3- and @xmath4-wave components of @xmath2 , we then calculated @xmath80 at zero temperature and estimated the transition temperature .",
    "finally , we discussed the surface current in the @xmath6 state .",
    "we saw that it is carried by the occupied zbss ; these states are * not * doppler - shifted by the current .",

    "we show the effect of the boundary on the andreev spectrum . in general , the boundary will cause mixing of different @xmath55 s . for each @xmath55 ,",
    "though , we have a different andreev equation , so adding the solutions of ( [ andreev ] ) for different @xmath55 s does not make sense .",

    "if we assume a specularly reflecting boundary , then the wave function will contain only two terms : @xmath233 such that @xmath234 since the angles are measured from the positive-@xmath64 semiaxis , see fig .",
    "the dirichlet boundary condition gives @xmath235 whereas the neumann boundary condition gives @xmath236 since @xmath237 for @xmath238 perpendicular to the surface , and we used @xmath239 to neglect the gradient of the andreev wave function . since ( [ andreev ] ) is linear , we can drop multiplicative constants and simply assume @xmath240 at the surface for either choice of the boundary condition . as @xmath241 is uniquely determined by @xmath242 through the relation ( [ inout ] ) , we shall label the potential @xmath2 along the trajectory as well as the solutions of the corresponding andreev equation by @xmath242 .",
    "we shall drop the subscript `` @xmath243 '' everywhere except in appendix c , where we will need to distinguish @xmath242 , the label for a trajectory as in fig .",
    "1 , from @xmath55 , the label for a position on the fermi surface as in fig .",
    "we obtain the gap equation by substituting for @xmath244 in ( [ defdelta ] ) its mean - field value , that is , the pairing amplitude @xmath245 . to calculate this amplitude , we expand the field operators into energy eigenstates @xmath246 equation ( [ expand ] ) gives at @xmath8 @xmath247 note that in ( [ expand ] ) , we explicitly sum over both positive and negative energies , unlike the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) formalism where we can sum over positive energies only , using the fact that @xmath248 are both solutions of the bdg equations with energies equal in absolute value and opposite in sign .",
    "however , this symmetry is lost here because the andreev wave functions corresponding to the bdg wave functions ( [ symmetry ] ) live on different quasiclassical trajectories .",
    "close to the surface , we have to remember again that each line contributes to the pairing amplitude at a given point for two directions @xmath55 ; see fig . 5 .",
    "we will , therefore , have to distinguish between the label of the trajectory @xmath242 and the label for the pairing amplitude @xmath55 .",
    "specifically , @xmath249 so the contribution to the pairing amplitude from the @xmath85-moving bound states will be @xmath250 and @xmath251 substituting ( [ pairingout ] ) and ( [ pairingin ] ) into ( [ defdelta ] ) gives @xmath252 and we used ( [ upperlower ] ) .",
