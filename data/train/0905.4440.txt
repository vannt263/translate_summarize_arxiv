    "in spite of significant progress in recent years , the nature of gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) , discovered by @xcite more than 30 years ago , is still enigmatic .",
    "although the light curves and emission spectra of grbs are very diverse , they seem to split into two groups of possibly different origin : long bursts ( @xmath1  s ) with a softer spectrum and short bursts ( @xmath2  s ) with a harder spectrum @xcite .",
    "the long grbs are often believed to be associated with star - formation regions @xcite .",
    "only these regions can host massive stars that have astronomically very short lifetime and die soon after the birth .",
    "in fact , recent observations have provided strong arguments in favour of the connection of grbs with the deaths of massive stars .",
    "light curves of many grb optical afterglows show features inherent in the supernovae events ; moreover , several long grbs have been firmly associated with particular supernovae , the most popular examples being grb 980425 and sn 1998bw @xcite .",
    "even more convincing evidence exists in the case of the low red shift grb 030329 ( @xmath3 ; @xcite ) and its associated supernova , sn 2003dh @xcite .",
    "the spectra of these supernovae show exceptionally broad emission lines indicating abnormally high velocity of the ejecta , typical of the recently proposed `` hypernovae '' class objects .",
    "the most popular model of the central engine of these sources is based on the `` failed supernova '' stellar collapse scenario implying that the iron core of the progenitor star forms a black hole @xcite . if the progenitor does not rotate , its collapse is likely to happen silently until all the star has been swallowed up by the black hole .",
    "if , however , the specific angular momentum of the equatorial part of the stellar envelope exceeds that of the last stable orbit of the black hole , then the collapse becomes highly anisotropic . while in the polar region it may proceed more or less uninhibited , the equatorial layers form a dense and massive accretion disk .",
    "then the collapse of the layers is delayed , and the gravitational energy released in the disk can be very large and drive grb outflows , predominantly in the polar directions where mass density of the accreting matter can be much lower @xcite . however , the actual process responsible for the grb outflows is not established and remains a subject of ongoing investigations . the main mechanisms proposed to explain grb outflows are neutrino pair annihilation heating @xcite , magnetized disk wind @xcite , and magnetic braking of the central black hole rotation @xcite",
    ".    high - precision self - consistent models of disk dynamics and neutrino propagation are required in order to obtain reliable results in the neutrino - driven supernova explosion theory . by now only relatively crude calculations have been carried out , and they show that the neutrino heating need not have a dominant role .",
    "@xcite studied the heating rate due to annihilation of neutrinos emitted by neutrinospheres of various prescribed geometries and temperatures .",
    "the energy deposition rates obtained in this paper lie in the range @xmath4  erg / s , and the typical annihilation efficiency seems to be rather low , about @xmath5 .",
    "neutrino heating from a geometrically thin standard accretion disk @xcite is calculated in a recent article by @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the process efficiency strongly depends on the rotation parameters of the black hole and rapidly decreases with the distance as @xmath6 .",
    "other aspects of the collapsar model were considered in @xcite .",
    "@xcite carried out general relativistic mhd simulations of accretion disks with the masses @xmath7 .",
    "they found that the disk opacity for neutrinos was high , resulting in low ( @xmath8 ) efficiency of neutrino emission itself , as most neutrinos generated in the disk could not escape from it and accreted in the black hole . @xcite",
    "considered both neutrino heating and cooling in their newtonian simulations of collapsars .",
    "they concluded that the neutrino energy deposition was insufficient to drive grb explosions and that the magnetic mechanism was more promising .    in the last few years",
    "the role of magnetic field in driving the black hole accretion and relativistic outflows has been a subject of active investigations via numerical simulations , that produced numerous interesting and important results @xcite . in these studies",
    "the initial distribution described a keplerian disk or equilibrium torus threaded with a relatively weak poloidal field , whose lines followed the iso - density or iso - pressure contours of the disk .",
    "the disk accretion was found to be driven by magnetic stresses via development of magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to the disk , the numerical solution considered two other generic structures - the magnetized disk corona and the highly magnetized polar funnel that hosted the relativistic outflow from the black hole .",
    "these studies applied simple adiabatic equations of state and did not take into account effects of radiative cooling that may be small for some types of active galactic nuclei , but not for disks of collapsing stars .",
    "recently @xcite have carried out two - dimensional general relativistic mhd simulations in kerr metrics with a realistic equation of state and taking into account the neutrino cooling , but the physical time span of their computations was rather short , only @xmath9  s.    in this article , we model the situation ( similar to @xcite ) when a massive stellar core collapses and the outer envelop forms a massive accreting torus . in section 2 , we consider physical processes , in section 3  initial conditions , in section 4  results , section 5 is the discussion .",
    "for the simulations we use the equation of state @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath12 is the radiation energy density constant , @xmath13 is concentration of baryons , @xmath14 is the mass of proton , @xmath15 is the pressure , @xmath16 is the density and @xmath17 is the temperature ; @xmath18 describes the ground level for the cold degenerate matter , the expression for @xmath18 is an approximation of the table function from @xcite .",
    "the specific energy ( per mass unit ) was defined thermodynamically as @xmath19    the value of @xmath20 was taken from @xcite .",
    "this equation of state allows us to deal with high - density matter .",
    "a more accurate eos is significantly more expensive in calculations , while the disregarding of the @xmath21-pair component in the plasma , for instance , can give a relative error in definition of the temperature less than @xmath22 at high temperatures @xcite .      on the grounds discussed in the introduction we ignore effects of neutrino heating in our simulations and take into account only the energy loss due to emission of neutrinos .",
    "approximation formulas for the cooling rates due to @xmath21 pair annihilation @xmath23 , neutrino photo - production @xmath24 , and plasma mechanism @xmath25 are taken from @xcite , the cooling rate due to urca processes @xmath26  from @xcite , and the cooling rate due to synchrotron neutrino emission @xmath27  from @xcite : @xmath28 the neutrino cooling is introduced by the source term in the energy - momentum equation @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the plasma four - velocity , @xmath31 is the determinant of the metric tensor , and @xmath32 is the cooling rate as measured in the fluid frame .",
    "one of the aims of our research was the investigation of sensitivity of the torus accretion model to the neutrino cooling processes .",
    "we compare two cases : with no cooling at all and the optically thin case with neutrino cooling .",
    "the first instance is the most popular @xcite and less realistic .",
    "the second instance well suits for a light torus with the mass of a few per cent of the solar .",
    "it could be realized when two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole merge .",
    "the intermediate optical depth case is considered in @xcite and can be suitable for a collapsar model when the disk mass reaches several solar masses .",
    "we make our calculation in the ideal relativistic mhd approximation using an upwind conservative scheme that is based on a linear riemann solver and the constrained transport method to evolve the magnetic field .",
    "the details of this numerical method and its testing results are expounded in @xcite .",
    "the gravitational attraction of the black hole is introduced via kerr metric in the kerr - schild coordinates , @xmath33 .",
    "we set the black hole mass as @xmath34 which corresponds to @xmath35  km ( we define @xmath36 ) .",
    "the two - dimensional axisymmetric computational domain is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the dimensionless angular momentum of the black hole ( @xmath40 is the black hole angular momentum ) , and @xmath41 km .",
    "we adopt free - outflow as the outer and the inner boundary conditions .",
    "the inner boundary is located just inside the event horizon and adopts the free - flow boundary conditions .",
    "it is worthy of notice that the inner boundary is inside of the outer event horizon - this choice is possible since the horizon coordinate singularity is absent in the kerr - schild coordinates .",
    "the total mass within the domain is small ( less than 25% ) as compared with the mass of the black hole , which allows us to ignore its self - gravity .",
    "the grid is uniform over @xmath42 , where it has 320 cells , and is almost uniform over @xmath43 , where it has 459 cells , the linear size of each cell being the same in both directions .    as the initial distribution we consider an equilibrium torus @xcite which is a `` torus '' of plasma with the black hole in the centre .",
    "the value of the specific angular momentum @xmath44 determines the total effective potential which can be written as    @xmath45    where @xmath46 and @xmath47 our numerical scheme can not operate with vacuum . to avoid this difficulty",
    ", we have to introduce minimum possible values of the density and pressure that limit how small they can be .",
    "we also check the magnetic field and do not allow it to drop below the value defined by the equations @xmath48 and @xmath49 . for the magnetization typical of the task considered these inequalities are usually satisfied with a margin of three orders .",
    "the magnetic field strength is limited by the pair production by the neutrino - antineutrino annihilation and the compton up scattering pair production @xcite .          through the horizon for the models : _ low torus momentum _ ( dashed line ) , _ neutrino cooling _",
    "( solid line ) , and _ quadrupole 2 _ ( dot - dashed - line),width=321 ]      the parameter we are most interested in is the energy release effectiveness @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the total energy flux at radius @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the accretion rate on the horizon of the black hole . in order to test the effectiveness dependence on the accretion conditions , we introduce several models with various initial magnetic fields and other parameters",
    ".    the initial magnetic field structure in the disk is mainly determined by the dynamo effect .",
    "dynamo in accretion disks was investigated by many authors @xcite in the context of @xmath54-@xmath55 model .",
    "depending on the dynamo parameters , stationary dipole or quadrupole magnetic fields were obtained .",
    "some models showed time oscillations .",
    "the calculations gave only a rough estimation of the magnetic field strength .",
    "to reproduce this simulations , we have chosen three different topologies of the initial magnetic field ( similar to @xcite ) .    due to a strong dependence of the toroidal field component on the poloidal one",
    ", we initially introduce a purely poloidal magnetic field .",
    "this field can be described by a vector potential with a single nonzero component @xmath56 . in our calculations",
    "we use @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the parameters of the vector potential .",
    "we adopt a dipole initial magnetic field for _ low torus momentum _ , _ high torus momentum _ , _ neutrino cooling _ , _ schwarzschild _ , and _ low magnetized _ models .",
    "quadrupole 1 _ possesses a quadrupole - like field generated by two dipoles : one is above and the second is below the equatorial plane .",
    "_ quadrupole 2 _ model also has a quadrupole field , but the two dipoles are situated closer and farther from the black hole , which reproduces time oscillating magnetic field in the accretion disk . the topology of magnetic field is presented in fig .",
    "[ top_field ] . in all the cases the initial field is normalized so that the maximum of the magnetic to gas pressure ratio @xmath60 does not exceed @xmath61 , except for the _ low magnetized _ model , where @xmath62 .",
    "we have chosen the small value of @xmath63 in order to avoid strong influence of the magnetic pressure on the initial hydrodynamical equilibrium of the configuration .",
    "the dimensionless angular momentum of the black hole is @xmath64 for all the models except for the _ schwarzschild _ one , where @xmath65 .",
    "the collapsing torus specific angular momentum and mass are equal to @xmath66 for _ low torus momentum _ , _ neutrino cooling _ , _ quadrupole 1 _ , _ quadrupole 2 _ models and @xmath67 for _ high torus momentum _ , _ schwarzschild _ , _ low magnetized _ models .",
    "in all the models , except for _ neutrino cooling _ , we neglect the neutrino cooling .",

    "topology and strength of the magnetic field play a crucial role in the process of accretion on a black hole . in our simulations",
    "the energy release effectiveness varies over two orders of magnitude when we change the magnetic field topology from the dipole ( _ neutrino cooling _ , _ high torus momentum _",
    "models ) to the quadrupole one(_quadrupole 1 _ , _ quadrupole 2 _ models ) . due to the 2d approach",
    "we can not consider the dynamo effect .",
    "however , we can see temporal increases of the magnetic field intensity owing to the mri - driven turbulence growth and magnetic line twist .",
    "the blandford - znajek mechanism plays a leading role in accreting black hole energy release . for a force - free monopole magnetosphere",
    "the blandford - znajek power is given by @xmath80 we assume @xmath81 , were @xmath82 is the angular velocity of the black hole and @xmath83 is the magnetic flux ( [ baushev ] ) threading the black hole .",
    "our estimations of the energy release effectiveness differ by a factor of @xmath84 from @xcite and by a factor of up to @xmath85 from @xcite .",
    "we explain it by distinctions between the initial magnetic fields : in @xcite , for instance , the magnetic field flux was @xmath86 times higher .",
    "neutrino cooling processes significantly suppress the wind from the accretion disk , but do not diminish appreciably the energy release ; moreover , sometimes they can stabilize the outflow . the neutrino driven oscillations ( fig .  [ oscil ] )",
    "look like an artificial effect of turning on the initial conditions : more realistic conditions like @xcite do not lead to significant radial oscillations .",
    "but even if the effect is real , the oscillations @xcite can scarcely be observed by gravitational wave detectors .",
    "highly magnetized jets appear in all the models considered , where the black hole possesses angular momentum .",
    "the obtained parameters of the plasma acceleration in the jets ( fig .",
    "[ lor_c ] ) are in good agreement with @xcite .    the boundary between the jet and the wind is unstable ( the perturbation growth is most pronounced in fig .  [ lor_c ] , _ neutrino cooling _ case , in the south hemisphere in the radius interval @xmath87 .",
    "@xcite reported about a similar effect ) .",
    "the jet speed is much higher than the sound speed in the wind , and the boundary perturbations generate strong shock waves propagating to the wind region ( fig.[fl_sl ] ) .",
    "the shocks effectively heat the wind and can produce a hot corona around the accretion disks like in the ss433 system @xcite .",
    "if we adopt the effectiveness coefficient @xmath88 of the models _ neutrino cooling _ and _ high torus momentum _ , it allows us to estimate the total energy release of the torus accretion as @xmath89  erg .",
    "this value of @xmath77 however , need not to be universal : as we saw , other magnetic field topologies can have a significantly different efficiency .",
    "the scenario considered in this article is a possible alternative to the magnetar - driven hypernova scheme @xcite .",
    "both the scenarios predict the appearance of collimated jets energetic enough to explain grb as well as hypernovae phenomena .",
    "accurate calculations are needed to find characteristic features and distinguish these two schemes . by",
    "now we can say that the chemical composition of matter in the jets should be different . in the collapsar scenario",
    "we expect a highly poynting - dominated jet ( @xmath90 , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the field and the matter energy flux densities , respectively ) , mainly made up of @xmath21-pairs , while in the magnetar - driven scenario the jet is baryon - dominated and intermediately magnetized ( @xmath93 )",
    ".    the effect of the magnetic field sign change found in the jet of the _ quadrupole 2 _ model , may be the key to understanding of the `` surprising evolution of the parsec - scale faraday rotation gradients in the jet of the bl lac object b1802 + 784 '' @xcite .",
    "complicated topology of the magnetic field in the accretion disk can lead to variations of the magnetic field direction in the jet . in this case",
    ", the jet constitutes a chain of regions with various magnetic field orientations .",
    "the accretion rate and energy release are governed by four main parameters : magnetic field structure , angular momentum of the black hole , specific angular momentum of the accreting matter , accretion disk mass or accreting part of the star envelop . to have a long - time accretion , angular momentum of the accreting matter should be high enough to form an accretion disk around the black hole . as it has been demonstrated by the _",
    "schwarzschild _ model ,",
    "if the black hole has deficient angular momentum , the powerful magnetized jet does not appear at all , which totally changes the picture of the accretion .",
    "moreover , a comparison of the _ low _ and _ high torus momentum _",
    "models shows us that a respectively small variation of the angular momentum of the accreting matter leads to a change of the accretion efficiency .",
    "neutrino losses do not prevent energy release and can even stabilize the magnetized jet outflow .",
    "the least understood and a very important factor defining the accretion efficiency is the disk magnetic field structure . as we could see from the calculations , a mere replacing of the dipole field by the quadrupole one decreases the energy release by two orders of magnitude .",
    "the magnetic flux @xmath83 governs the energy extraction from ergosphere ( [ ebz ] ) , while the black hole magnetosphere is formed and supported by the disk . in our calculations we preset the initial magnetic field in the torus",
    "it is clear , however , that self - consistent numerical calculations of the magnetic dynamo in the disk are necessary in order to elucidate the problem .",
    "nevertheless , our calculations show that a very intensive electromagnetic and matter energy flux can be evolved during massive torus accretion on a rotating black hole with mass @xmath94 .",
    "the total energy budget is quite sufficient to explain hypernova explosions like grb 980425 or grb 030329 .",
    "the magnetized matter accretion on a rotating black hole is a very promising model of the central engine of these phenomena .",
    "in addition , we have found that the instability of the boundary between the jet and the wind generates shock waves propagating to the wind region and heating it .",
