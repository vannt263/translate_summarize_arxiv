    "this paper is the second in a series that researches the morse theory , gradient flows , concavity and complexity on smooth compact manifolds with boundary . in the context of @xmath8-flows ,",
    "some of its ideas can be traced back to @xcite .",
    "the paper serves as an analytical foundation for the investigation of _ boundary generic _",
    "( see definition [ def2.1 ] ) and , so called , _ _ traversally generic _ _ that vanish on @xmath0 , the @xmath4-trajectory space is pathological ; in contrast , the trajectory spaces of a traversally generic fields are a compact @xmath9-complexes . ]",
    "( see definition [ def3.2 ] ) vector fields @xmath4 on manifolds @xmath0 with boundary .",
    "these analytical tools provide us with local semi - algebraic models for the ways in which typical nonsingular vector flows interact with the boundary @xmath5 . here the word  local \" refers to the vicinity of a given trajectory @xmath10 of the @xmath4-flow .",
    "the main observation is that , for smooth fields , each intersection point @xmath11 comes with a positive integral multiplicity @xmath12 attached to it .",
    "this multiplicity @xmath12 can be given a number of competing but equivalent definitions , one of which uses the _",
    "morse stratification _",
    "( see definition [ def2.1 ] and formula ( [ eq2.1 ] ) ) , which has been studied in @xcite .",
    "naively , one can think of @xmath12 as a _ multiplicity of tangency _ between @xmath10 and @xmath5 .",
    "so , surprisingly , the smooth topology of the flow can distinguish between , say , degree 2 and degree 4 tangency !",
    "lemma [ lem3.1 ] and lemma [ lem3.4 ] describe the models for @xmath5 and @xmath4 in the vicinity of point @xmath11 and in the vicinity of a trajectory @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "it turns out that , for traversally generic fields , in special flow - adjusted coordinates @xmath13 , the boundary is given by a real polynomial equation @xmath14 of degree that depends on @xmath10 and does not exceed @xmath7 .",
    "the manifold @xmath0 is given by the polynomial inequality @xmath15 .",
    "the polynomial @xmath16 depends only on the ordered sequence of multiplicities @xmath17 .",
    "so , in each dimension , there are only finitely many semi - algebraic models for the vicinity of @xmath4-trajectories @xmath10 in @xmath0 .",
    "we introduce a variety of spaces that correspond to different types of vector fields on @xmath0 , the space @xmath1 of generic with respect to the boundary fields and the space @xmath2 of traversally generic fields are among them .",
    "two theorems describe our main results : theorem [ th3.4 ] claims that @xmath1 is an open and dense in the space of all smooth fields @xmath3 , and theorem [ th3.5 ] claims that @xmath2 is open and dense in the space @xmath18 of all _ traversing _ ( equivalently , all gradient - like non - vanishing ) fields .",
    "traversing fields have only trajectories that are homeomorphic to closed intervals or singletons .",
    "let @xmath4 be a vector field on a smooth compact @xmath19-manifold @xmath0 with boundary @xmath5 . to achieve some uniformity in our notations ,",
    "let @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the vector field @xmath4 gives rise to a partition @xmath22 of the boundary @xmath23 into two sets : the locus @xmath24 , where the field is directed inward of @xmath0 , and @xmath25 , where it is directed outwards .",
    "we assume that @xmath4 , viewed as a section of the quotient line bundle @xmath26 over @xmath5 , is transversal to its zero section .",
    "this assumption implies that both sets @xmath27 are compact manifolds which share a common boundary @xmath28 .",
    "evidently , @xmath29 is the locus where @xmath4 is _ tangent _ to the boundary @xmath23 .",
    "morse has noticed that , for a generic vector field @xmath4 , the tangent locus @xmath29 inherits a similar structure in connection to @xmath24 , as @xmath30 has in connection to @xmath0 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "that is , @xmath4 gives rise to a partition @xmath31 of @xmath32 into two sets : the locus @xmath33 , where the field is directed inward of @xmath24 , and @xmath34 , where it is directed outward of @xmath24 . again , let us assume that @xmath4 , viewed as a section of the quotient line bundle @xmath35 over @xmath29 , is transversal to its zero section .    for generic fields ,",
    "this structure replicates itself : the cuspidal locus @xmath36 is defined as the locus where @xmath4 is tangent to @xmath29 ; @xmath36 is divided into two manifolds , @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in @xmath37 , the field",
    "is directed inward of @xmath33 , in @xmath38 , outward of @xmath33 .",
    "we can repeat this construction until we reach the zero - dimensional stratum @xmath39 .",
    "these considerations motivate    [ def2.1 ] we say that a smooth field @xmath4 on @xmath0 is _ boundary generic _ if :    * @xmath40 , * @xmath4 , viewed as a section of the tangent bundle @xmath41 , is transversal to its zero section , * for each @xmath42 , the @xmath4-generated stratum @xmath43 is a smooth submanifold of @xmath44 , * the field @xmath4 , viewed as section of the quotient 1-bundle @xmath45 is transversal to the zero section of @xmath46 for all @xmath47 .",
    "thus a boundary generic vector field @xmath4 on @xmath0 gives rise to two stratifications : @xmath48 , the first one by closed submanifolds , the second one  by compact ones . here",
    "for simplicity , the notations ",
