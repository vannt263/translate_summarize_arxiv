    "with the advent of millimeter - wave spectroscopy , large - scale surveys of the 115  ghz co @xmath16 line ( e.g. dame et al .",
    "2001 ) have revolutionized our understanding of molecular clouds , the birthplaces of all stars . yet , in terms of clouds physical structure and evolution , many elementary questions remain shrouded in uncertainty . illuminating these fundamental issues",
    "will enable a more complete understanding of how stars form ( e.g. bally et al .",
    "1987 ) in a galactic context .",
    "sadly , numerous observational challenges frustrate these efforts . for example , optically - thin spectral line diagnostics of co that probe the contents of the entire cloud entangle all structural cloud components along a given line of sight .",
    "one solution to this problem is to constrain one s view to particular structural regions of a cloud ; for example a cloud s `` surface '' , where ambient ultraviolet ( uv ) photons have not been entirely absorbed by dust grains and ( e.g. h@xmath7 ) molecules , and therefore illuminate ( and dominate ) physical structure and chemical processes .",
    "photodissociation regions ( pdr s ) are these boundary interfaces , representing the transition between atomic and molecular phases of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "most models invoked to explain the physics in these regions assume molecular clouds of uniform properties surrounding the uv radiation source , typically a neighboring early type star ( tielens and hollenbach 1985 ; van dishoeck & black 1988 ; burton , hollenbach , & tielens 1990 ; hollenbach et al .",

    "uv photons with energies greater than the hydrogen ionization threshold of 13.6 ev create an region surrounding the energetic star(s ) .",
    "uv photons with energy less than this threshold escape from the region into an adjacent molecular cloud , where photodissociation of dominant molecules like h@xmath7 and co takes place , as well as photoionization of atoms with an ionization threshold lower than that of hydrogen  such as carbon , which is abundant and ionizes with photon energies as low as 11.26  ev .",
    "the combined effect of co photodissociation and c@xmath17 photoionization by uv photons produces a layered structure of c@xmath18/c@xmath17/co surrounding the region and extending into the molecular cloud .",
    "this basic picture of the c@xmath18/c@xmath17/co interface structure , as modeled for homogeneous cloud structures , is not in very good agreement with observations of edge - on pdrs ( i.e. m17 ) ; in general it is unable to account for the extended distribution of [ ] and [ ] emission seen in these regions ( stutzki et al .",
    "1988 , keene et al .",
    "however , models of inhomogeneous photodissociation regions have proven capable of accounting for the extended [ ] and [ ] distribution observed in some pdr s ( stutzki et al .",

    "the inhomogeneity , or `` clumpiness '' , of molecular clouds is well recognized ( e.g. blitz & williams 1987 ) ; it seems only natural that such clouds uv - illuminated surfaces should bear similar physical traits .",
    "an ideal observational target for such studies is the @xmath0 ophiuchi molecular cloud .",
    "it is one of the nearest ( @xmath19 130 pc ) and most active star - forming clouds and has a rich and varied environment that provides the observational basis for the current `` standard model '' of low - mass star formation ( shu 1977 ; shu , adams , & lizano 1987 ) .",
    "the region hosts three hot b - type stars , although hd  147889 appears to dominate the heating and excitation of the cloud s atomic and molecular `` surface '' ( liseau et al .",
    "hd  147889 is the most - embedded ( e@xmath20=1.09 ; a@xmath21 ) optically - visible star that has been studied by high resolution ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy ; the line of sight passes through the diffuse atomic and molecular `` halo '' of the @xmath0 oph cloud ( cf .",
    "van dishoeck & de zeeuw 1984 ; crutcher & chu 1985 ; cardelli & wallerstein 1986 ) .",
    "because of its deep obscuration and periphery to the main molecular cloud , hd  147889 is thought to lie just beyond the molecular cloud , illuminating it from behind .",
    "modeling of the 158  [ ] line intensity as a function of projected distance from hd  147889 led liseau et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to the conclusion that the uv - illuminated pdr back surface of the @xmath0 oph cloud is approximately concave .",
    "study of such a varied and complicated environment as @xmath0 oph is challenging .",
    "high spectral and angular resolution is required to disentangle the complicated structure of actively star - forming environments , but simultaneously the overall structure of the cloud only becomes apparent with studies of large angular extent .",
    "we have attempted to bridge these two disparate extremes by exploiting the powers of far - infrared and submillimeter spectroscopy on both large and small telescopes . in   2 and   3 , we present and interpret large - scale ( @xmath22 ) maps of the molecular cloud in submillimeter co@xmath23 and [ ] @xmath24 emission , with 25,000  a.u .",

    "the co emission peak , with a peak brightness temperature of @xmath545k is spatially coincident with the filamentary western boundary of the cloud .",

    "the addition of the 810  ghz co@xmath42 and [ ] @xmath4 lines confirms that the [ ] level populations are thermalized at the co excitation temperature ( table  [ excite ] : 25 - 45k in the west , 20 - 25k in the map center , and 10 - 15k to the east ) .",

    "indeed , the 492  ghz line optical depth actually reaches a maximum of @xmath87 at the second [ ] peak near @xmath0  oph  f due to the lower kinetic temperatures expected there and the correspondingly greater populations in the @xmath88 and @xmath89 levels .    in figure  [ ci - iso ] , we overplot the same ast / ro [ ] contours atop a gray - scale image of the @xmath0 oph cloud taken in 7 & 15  dust emission , from abergel et al .

    "the previous study interprets the eastern [ ] line emission peak ( `` peak ii '' ) as being potentially due to the chemical youth of the region , because the atomic carbon and c@xmath11o integrated intensity maxima do not follow the standard c@xmath6/c / co arrangement expected in plane - parallel pdrs .",
    "indeed , an atomic - carbon - rich region could be due to the ongoing formation of a dark cloud where the ionic , atomic , and molecular forms of carbon have not yet equilibrated .",
    "although this prospect is exciting , our study of the @xmath0  oph cloud in both species does not strongly support this interpretation for the following reasons :    * 1 ) * emission from atomic carbon does in fact trace the co column density and dust continuum relatively faithfully .",
    "the eastern `` carbon peak '' in our maps follows a northwest - to - southeast ridge that is also reproduced in c@xmath11o j=1@xmath900 emission in the wilking & lada ( 1983 ) map and also realized by our c@xmath11o j=2@xmath901 and hco@xmath6 j=3@xmath902 maps around elias 29 , part of the atomic carbon `` ridge '' ( figure  [ smt6 ] ) .",

    "if the observed 1 - 0 s(1 ) emission ( from boulanger et al .",
    "1999 ) originates from the back side of the cloud , as does the rest of the [ ] emission , the near - ir h@xmath7 emission would have to pass through a mean column density loosely equivalent to a@xmath214 , assuming a mean reference value of the gas / dust extinction ratio of @xmath215 measured in diffuse interstellar clouds .",

    "the c@xmath11o structure of the @xmath0  oph  a core is directly comparable to recent submillimeter continuum emission , however hco@xmath6 line emission is concentrated in a ring - like structure .",
    "modeling of the hco@xmath6 ring in comparison to co suggests that the condensations are due to both a higher hco@xmath6 abundance and a dominant dense gas component with @xmath223 .",
