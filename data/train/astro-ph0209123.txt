    "circular and linear polarization are important diagnostics of nonthermal radio emission and its environment in extragalactic radio sources and galactic micro - quasars . in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , linear polarization ( lp ) has been used to demonstrate that the emission mechanism is synchrotron radiation , that magnetic fields are present and that shocks propagate in jets , compressing the magnetic fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "lp is typically greater than 1% and is present in a very high fraction of powerful extragalactic radio sources @xcite .",
    "rotation measures are used to study the plasma density and magnetic field in accretion and outflow regions of agn @xcite .",
    "the significance of circular polarization ( cp ) is less clear .",
    "a variety of mechanisms can produce the small levels of cp seen in these sources , including intrinsic and extrinsic origins .",
    "synchrotron and cyclotron emission produce cp in varying degrees depending on the the electron population , magnetic field strength and orientation .",
    "coherent emission processes may also lead to cp .",
    "in addition , the presence of electrons with lorentz factors @xmath2 in or near a synchrotron source can significantly alter both cp and lp through faraday effects .",
    "the combination of these effects can lead to complex polarized spectra .",
    "finally , a magnetized scattering region can produce scintillating cp .",
    "recently , there has been a sharp increase in interest in cp observations .",
    "cp has been detected in sagittarius a * @xcite , a large number of powerful extragalactic radio sources @xcite including some idv sources @xcite , and galactic microquasars @xcite .",
    "vlbi imaging of powerful extragalactic radio sources indicate that the cp is confined to the cores .",
    "the spectral and variability properties in these sources vary widely indicating potentially diverse origins . in most sources",
    ", lp dominates cp , as expected for simple synchrotron sources . a notable exception to this is sgr a * , which exhibits no lp .",
    "the polarization properties of low luminosity agn ( llagn ) have not been previously investigated .",
    "@xcite observed the lp of a sample of `` weak '' radio sources ( @xmath3 ) with flat spectra .",
    "many of these sources were unpolarized at a level of 1% at 15 ghz , suggesting that they are not simply scaled down versions of powerful agn .",
    "however , there exists a significant gap in luminosity between these sources and sgr a * , which has a radio luminosity @xmath4 .",
    "the intrinsic nature of the llagn is still in doubt ( for recent reviews see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these sources display emission line luminosities that may be produced through a variety of mechanisms , including stellar photoionization , collisional ionization through shocks or in a starburst .",
    "a variety of methods have demonstrated that some of the sources display agn - like characteristics .",
    "however , as in the case of sgr a * , the luminosities are substantially sub - eddington and there is dispute over the roles of advection , convection and outflow in these sources .",
    "the detection of high brightness temperature radio components has made a strong case for the role of jets in these sources .",
    "lp and cp can act as probes of the radio - emitting region as well as of the accretion and outflow regions through which the emission propagates .",
    "we present here a radio polarization survey of 11 nearby llagn with luminosities in the range @xmath5 to @xmath6 @xmath7 . in  2 , we describe the observations , our error analysis and the results .",
    "cp is only detected in one source , ngc 3031 ( m81 * ) .",
    "we have discussed the significance of this detection in another paper @xcite .",
    "lp is detected in 4 sources .",
    "we discuss our results in  3 and summarize in  4 .",
    "a sample of 11 llagn was selected from the samples of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the selected sources ( table  [ tab : results ] ) are the brightest radio sources in the catalogs for which we were able to obtain data .",
    "we observed the sample with the very large array in the c configuration on 4 april 2000 for 12 hours at 8.4 ghz .",
    "the correlator was configured for continuum observations with 50 mhz bandwidth each in two intermediate frequency bands in right ( rcp ) and left circular polarization ( lcp ) .",
    "the angular resolution was about @xmath8 .",
    "observations were carried out with the same techniques described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "absolute flux calibration was set with a short observation of 3c 48 .",
    "scans of the target sources were bracketed with scans for pointing and calibration on a nearby background compact radio source .",
    "a second nearby background compact radio source was observed in the same way as the target sources as a check for cp calibration errors .",
    "we cycled through calibration and target sources in about 10 minutes .",
    "calibrator , target and check sources were placed in five groups , labeled a through e , based on their proximity on the sky .",
    "integration time for each target source was set to achieve rms noise errors of less than 0.1% except for the weak sources i 1024 and ngc 3516 .",
    "observations were made over 12 hours , leading to significant changes in parallactic angle , azimuth angle and elevation angle for each source .",
    "at least 4 observations were made of each source .",
    "data were reduced in aips .",
    "the calibration sources were self - calibrated assuming @xmath9 .",
    "linear polarization calibration was also performed using the calibration sources .",
    "amplitude gains , phase gains and polarization leakage terms were transferred to the target and check sources .",
    "all sources were imaged in stokes i , q , u and v. flux densities were estimated by fitting gaussians at the source s location .",
    "results are summarized in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "some sources were resolved in total intensity . however , polarization images were unresolved for all sources except ngc 4374 and ngc 4486 .",
    "we plot the linear and circular polarizations together in figure  [ fig : lpcp ] .",
    "systematic errors from beam squint , gain and leakage terms are estimated according to the model for the vla in @xcite to be between 0.03 and 0.05% in total , depending on the number of scans per source .",
    "we see that that measured cp for the check sources range from 0.03 to 0.45% with a median of 0.14% .",
    "the likely source of additional error is polarization of the calibrator and/or check source .",
    "ngc 3031 is the only source where the measured cp exceeds that of the check source and is greater than 3 times the thermal noise .",
    "the cp for ngc 3031 is , in fact , 10 times the thermal noise and repeatedly detectable @xcite .",
    "we do not count ngc 6500 as a cp detection because of the large measured cp for the check source , j1745 + 173 .",
    "the two large cp values with the same sign suggest that the calibrator , j1751 + 096 , may have cp at a level of @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite report a tentative detection of @xmath11 for j1751 + 096 in their 15 ghz vlba observations , which is consistent in sign and in magnitude for a steep spectral index .",
    "for all sources , the measured polarization fractions are lower limits to the polarization of the nuclear source . for a typical distance of 10 mpc , the linear resolution of these observations",
    "is @xmath12 pc .",
    "diffuse thermal radiation can contribute significantly to the total flux .",
    "however , for the sources for which we know of vlbi observations , the compact radio flux is a substantial component of the total flux .",
    "ngc 3031 and ngc 4486 ( m87 ) both have well - studied vlbi properties , which show that a compact core dominates the total flux @xcite . @xcite and @xcite",
    "also show that the ratio of 5 ghz vlba to vla flux densities is on the order of unity for five of our sources : ngc 4278 , ngc 4374 , ngc 4552 , ngc 4579 and ngc 6500 .",
    "for all 13 sources in the @xcite sample , the ratio is greater than 0.48 .",
    "nevertheless , a factor of a few in the ratio of total to compact flux density would raise the polarization limits to the point where sgr a * and ngc 3031 would not be detected .",
    "we detect lp in 3 of 11 sources : ngc 4278 , ngc 4486 , and ngc 4579 .",
    "these results show that some llagn do exhibit lp , contrary to the conclusions of @xcite , which were based on less sensitive data .",
    "this is strong evidence for a nonthermal contribution to the flux density .",
    "however , the rate of detection of lp is lower than that of more powerful agn .",
    "for example , @xcite detect lp in all but 3 of their 40 sources with a mean value of a few percent .",
    "in addition , the fraction of lp detected in our sources is lower than in more powerful agn . excluding m87 , the mean fractional lp is @xmath13 .",
    "of the 62 sources in the pearson - readhead flux - limited sample , 39 have polarization greater than 1% at 4.8 ghz and 57 have polarization greater than 1% at 15 ghz @xcite .",
    "mean polarizations are on the order of a few percent .",
    "these trends are true for quasars , bl lac objects and radio galaxies in the sample .",
    "this difference can not be explained by confusion .",
    "all three sources have been previously detected with vlbi and been shown to be dominated by their compact flux @xcite .",
    "are the llagn intrinsically weakly polarized or are they depolarized by their surrounding medium ?",
    "a number of scenarios may lead to intrinsic depolarization .",
    "extreme magnetic field disorder in the source will leave the source weakly polarized .",
    "this may be due to the absence of shocks in jets that order the field and produce regions of high polarization fraction . a high degree of symmetry in the magnetic field , i.e. , a face on azimuthal field or a radial field will also lead to a weakly polarized source .",
    "such field configurations might be typical of disk accretion or quasi - spherical accretion .",
    "finally , internal faraday depolarization may occur if the density of nonrelativistic particles in the emitting region is large enough .",
    "on the other hand , depolarization in the accretion , outflow or surrounding regions is more than adequate to account for this result .",
    "beam and bandwidth depolarization at these frequencies and in these bandwidths will occur for rotation measures of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "@xcite has measured rms as large as @xmath16 towards the cores of powerful agn . @xcite",
    "have measured a rm@xmath17 towards sagittarius a * , which may arise from the accretion and outflow regions or from an interstellar halo . even for the very low accretion rates of adaf and cdaf models of sgr a * , rms can easily reach @xmath18 and higher @xcite . the radio emission from our sources",
    "almost certainly propagates through similar media . in the case of ngc 4258 ,",
    "for example , the radio emission originates from within 0.02 pc of the black hole @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the radio emission from much more powerful agn may begin parsecs away from the black hole .",
    "the radio intermediate quasar iii zw 2 provides an interesting case for comparison .",
    "this compact radio source ( @xmath19 pc ) shows superluminal expansion and spectral evolution consistent with shock excitation in a relativistic outflow @xcite .",
    "however , the source exhibits no linear polarization in 20 years of monitoring ( m. aller , private communication ) .    in order to look for the effects of bandwidth depolarization and large rms , we compared the difference between lower and upper sideband position angles for all sources .",
    "these sidebands are each 50 mhz wide and separated from each other by 50 mhz .",
    "we find a significant change only for ngc 4579 of @xmath20 degrees",
    ". systematic error due to leakage term miscalibration is less than 10 degrees . by comparison ,",
    "ngc 4278 , which is polarized at a level similar to ngc 4579 , shows a difference of 6 degrees in the position angle .",
    "changes in the position angle for calibrator sources were also consistent with thermal noise .",
    "the implied rm for ngc 4579 is @xmath21 .",
    "this would lead to bandwidth depolarization @xmath22 , which does not significantly increase the intrinsic lp .",
    "however , one can not rule out a much higher rm inducing more substantial depolarization as well as the angular rotation",
    ". we can compute an upper limit for the rm @xmath23 with the requirement of a maximum of 70% intrinsic polarization .    as discussed above",
    ", this rm could arise from a variety of sources . without more detailed knowledge of the source geometry",
    ", it is difficult to place limits on specific source models such as jet , adaf and cdaf models . unlike the case of millimeter wavelength polarization in sgr a * , the centimeter wavelength emission from ngc 4579 may originate far outside of the accretion region .",
    "however , if the emission does pass through the accretion region , then the accretion rate must be very low @xcite .",
    "spectropolarimetry , higher frequency polarimetry and vlbi polarimetry are potentially useful tests of these scenarios .",
    "they could provide quantitative information about field strengths and particle densities in the inner few parsecs of these sources .",
    "we compare the rates of detection of cp here with that in powerful extragalactic radio sources . at a level of @xmath0",
    ", we detect 1 out of 9 sources .",
    "@xcite detect cp greater than 0.1% in 12 out of 30 sources .",
    "@xcite detect cp greater than 0.1% in 11 out of 40 sources .",
    "due to the small number of sources in our sample , we can not conclude that the rate of cp in llagn is less than that in powerful agn .",
    "however , the trend appears to be that way .",
    "what physical condition leads to the presence of cp in some sources and not in others ?",
    "ngc 3031 and sgr a * are both unique in that they have inverted spectra at the frequencies where cp is detected .",
    "we summarize the spectral index information for sources where simultaneous spectra are available in figure  [ fig : lpcp ] .",
    "all spectral indices come from the measurements of @xcite . while the number of sources is small , the trend is apparent",
    ".    this effect may be the result of an inhomogeneous synchrotron source in the optically thick regime .",
    "orientation effects may also be of importance since the magnitude of cp from a synchrotron source depends on the line of sight magnetic field strength .",
    "finally , ngc 3031 is also the closest of our survey sources , suggesting that resolution of thermal sources in the nucleus and of extended optically , thin regions in the jet may be important .",
    "we have observed linear and circular polarization in a sample of low luminosity agn .",
    "the polarization properties of these sources differ from those of more powerful agn .",
    "linear polarization is less frequently detected and less strong when detected .",
    "circular polarization is less frequently detected .",
    "the conclusion is not as simple as claiming that these sources differ intrinsically from the more powerful agn , however . while increased field disorder in the sources could explain the results , environmental depolarization effects",
    "could also play a role .",
    "these polarization measurements probe regions on a scale of parsecs and smaller in these sources .",
    "detection of rotation measures in these sources is a direct measure of the environment of a supermassive black hole , which may be used to constrain models for accretion and outflow .",
