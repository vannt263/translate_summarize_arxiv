    "[ summary ] .",
    "we consider a non - hermitian model with complex boundary potentials and its hamiltonian is@xmath0where @xmath1 is the creation operator of the boson ( or fermion ) at @xmath2th site .",
    "there are two sets of hopping integrals with strength * *  * * @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . for simplicity",
    ", we only consider the case with @xmath5 even .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath6 has @xmath7 symmetry , i.e. , @xmath8=0 $ ] , where @xmath9 and @xmath10  represent the space - reflection operator , or parity operator and the time - reversal operator , respectively .",
    "the effects of @xmath9 and @xmath10  on a discrete system are @xmath11since the discovery of bender and colleagues in 1998 that a non - hermitian hamiltonian having simultaneous parity - time @xmath7  symmetry has an entirely real quantum - mechanical energy spectrum @xcite , there has been an intense effort to establish a @xmath7-symmetric quantum theory as a complex extension of the conventional quantum mechanics .",
    "the reality of the spectra is responsible to the @xmath7  symmetry .",
    "if all the eigenstates of the hamiltonian are also eigenstates of @xmath7 , then all the eigenvalues are strictly real and the symmetry is said to be unbroken .",
    "otherwise , the symmetry is said to be spontaneously broken . on the other hand , the unitary time - evolution of wave functions in a non - hermitian hamiltonian",
    "could also be guaranteed when redefining the biorthogonal inner product instead of the dirac inner product . however , when the system isunder the ep , the norm of biorthogonal inner product for coalescing eigenstates is zero .    in the case of @xmath12",
    ", it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this model exhibits two phases , an unbroken symmetry phase with a purely real energy spectrum when the potentials are in the region @xmath13 and a spontaneously - broken symmetry phase with @xmath14 real and @xmath15 imaginary eigenvalues when the potentials are in the region @xmath16 .",
    "the ep occurs at @xmath17 , at which two zero - energy eigenstates coalesce . in the case of @xmath18 , the model",
    "is systematically investigated in ref .",
    "chens .    in this work",
    ", we revisit this model from another perspective , focusing on the property of coalescing zero - mode state based on exact solutions .",
    "we start with the case of @xmath19  and @xmath20 . according to bulk - boundary correspondence",
    ", there are two zero modes at the middle of the band gap for infinite @xmath21 , characterizing the topology of the band ryu , ganeshan .",
    "these two states are all called edge modes , since they are localized states , with the particle probability distributing at the ends of the chain . for finite @xmath21 , two zero modes split near the zero energy .",
    "we are interested in what happens when the imaginary potentials @xmath22  are switched on .",
    "it is a little bit complicated to get and analyze the exact solutions .",
    "numerical simulation shows that the ep occurs at a certain value of @xmath23 , at which the two midgap states coalesce to a single eigenstate .",
    "fortunately , we can demonstrate this point by a simple exact result .",
    "a straightforward derivation shows that when taking @xmath24the state defined as @xmath25 is a zero - mode eigenstate , where state @xmath26  is defined as@xmath27and @xmath28  is the vacuum state of particle operator @xmath29 , i.e. , * *  * * @xmath30 . and field operator is@xmath31,\\]]i.e.,@xmath32furthermore , the many - particle state @xmath33 is still a zero - mode eigenstate . here @xmath34 is the dirac normalizing constant .",
    "similarly , the zero - mode state for @xmath35 can be constructed as@xmath36\\left\\vert \\text{\\textrm{vac}}\\right\\rangle , \\]]satisfying @xmath37^{\\dagger } \\left\\vert \\eta _ { % \\mathrm{zm}}\\right\\rangle = 0.\\]]on the other hand , it is easy to check @xmath38and    @xmath39    which indicate that the coalescing levels typically produce not only eigenstates but also adjoint states . in the context of non - hermitian",
    "quantum mechanics , the adjoint states refer to the eigenstates of @xmath40 , which always share the same spectrum with those of @xmath6 .",
    "both the eigenstates of @xmath6  and @xmath40  could construct the biorthogonal inner product instead of the dirac inner product in order to guarantee the unitary time - evolution of wave functions in a non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "when the system is under the ep , two eigenstates of @xmath6  coalesce and the norm of biorthogonal inner product for coalescing eigenstates is zero .",
    "meanwhile , it is a natural result that two eigenstates of @xmath40  also coalesce due to the fact @xmath41 . here",
    "the two coalescing eigenstates of @xmath6(@xmath40 ) would become only one eigenstate in the non - hermitian system while there are two - fold degenerate states in the hermitian system that we will consider in the next section .",
    "the existence of two - fold degenerate entangled states in the hermitian system would degrade the efficiency of the entangled state in practice . while , there is a single midgap entangled state in the non - hermitian system , which is robust .",
    "based on these facts we conclude that the zero - mode state @xmath42  is a coalescing state and the ep occurs at @xmath43 .",
    "the exact wave function of @xmath44 clearly indicates that it is a  superposition of two parts with nonzero amplitudes only located at even or odd sites , respectively .",
    "it will be shown that such two parts , which consist of even and odd sites respectively , have a close relation to the standard edge states of a hermitian chain in the thermodynamic limit .    in our work , we explore the quantum correlation , entanglement of a midgap state for a non - hermitian hamiltonian . unlike the dynamics , such the feature of a state has no memory about its own history .",
    "one can not detect how the state was prepared , via a hermitian or non - hermitian system .",
    "in contrast , the metric of biorthogonal inner product in non - hermitian quantum mechanics is dependent of hamiltonian .",
    "meanwhile , when the system is under the ep , the norm of biorthogonal inner product for coalescing eigenstates is zero , which is the characteristic of a non - hermitian system . on the other hand ,",
    "the entanglement is measured via local dirac probability in experiments . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we plot the profiles of the dirac probability distribution of the zero - mode states in a @xmath45-site chain at eps where all the zero - mode states have been normalized in dirac inner product . here",
    "the local dirac probability is defined as @xmath46  with @xmath47 .",
    "we see that a smaller @xmath48  requires a smaller @xmath49 , leading to more localized probability distribution  and bigger gap .",
    "it is the key feature of the non - hermitian zero - mode state , which should have wild applications in many aspects .",
    "we will demonstrate this point explicitly in the following sections .",
    "in this section , we investigate the property of the zero - mode state .",
    "we consider a hermitian model on the same lattice with @xmath6 and its hamiltonian is@xmath50the hamiltonian @xmath51 has @xmath9 symmetry , i.e. , @xmath52=0 $ ] .",
    "then all the eigenstates should have reflection symmetry .",
    "we still investigate the midgap state through a simple exact solution . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the two systems @xmath6  and @xmath53 are schematically illustrated .",
    "a straightforward derivation shows that when taking @xmath54the state is defined as @xmath55 with @xmath56 , and @xmath57 ,   \\label{zm_hermitian}\\]]is the field operator of zero - mode eigenstate , i.e. , @xmath58it is easy to find that@xmath59the relation between zero - mode states of the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath6 and the hermitian one @xmath51 is very clear , that is , the two hamiltonians share a same zero - mode state .",
    "furthermore , one can obtain the exact wave function for the standard zero modes * *  * * by simply taking @xmath60 , i.e. , @xmath61 .",
    "then our hermitian model would become a standard ssh chain and accordingly the standard edge states can be defined as @xmath62  with @xmath63 , @xmath64 , where * *  * * @xmath65with @xmath66  and @xmath67 .",
    "interestingly , one can see that the profile of the wave functions are unchanged .",
    "then we get the conclusion that wave functions @xmath42 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , can be obtained directly by the truncations of the standard zero - mode wave functions .",
    "it appears an interesting coincidence  that the zero - mode states in eq .",
    "( zm_hermitian ) are identical to those of the non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "here we would like to give a further explanation on the essential of the coincidence .",
    "we note that in both hermitian and non - hermitian lattices , the sub - hamiltonians in the region far from the boundary are identical , i.e.,@xmath70and in this region the single - particle wave function can be expressed as@xmath71where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 are undetermined parameters .",
    "then the corresponding schrodinger equation for a zero - mode state has the forms@xmath76 = 0 , \\\\",
    "-\\kappa ( c_{k}e^{ikj}+d_{k}e^{-ikj})-\\left [ c_{k}e^{ik\\left ( j-1\\right ) } + d_{k}e^{-ik\\left ( j-1\\right ) } \\right ] = 0,% \\end{array}% \\right.\\]]which lead to@xmath77or the compact form @xmath78with@xmath79the existence of the solution requires that@xmath80or@xmath81 in our work , we only consider the case with @xmath20 .",
    "then the possible solution of @xmath82  is @xmath83which describes an evanescent wave in accord with the edge state at the midgap .",
    "this fact indicates that both hermitian and non - hermitian systems share a common @xmath82  and therefore the main form of their wave functions is similar .",
    "the parameters @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75  or the relations between them could be finally determined by the boundary and normalization conditions .",
    "based on the above analysis , we could achieve two degenerate solutions for the hermitian system , while only one solution for the non - hermitian system ( for the zero - mode state of @xmath84 , we can only follow the same method above after taking @xmath85 due to the reason @xmath86 ) . in this sense ,",
    "the coincidence  becomes natural if suitable boundary conditions for the two systems are chosen .",
    "entanglement is an intriguing characteristic of quantum mechanics and is fundamentally different from any correlation known in classical physics",
    ". it would be interesting for both quantum information and condensed matter if one could generate particular entangled states in a controlled manner .",
    "the typical entanglement refers to a two - particle system .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated that the mode entanglement of a single particle can be used for dense coding and quantum teleportation despite the superselection rule heaney . in the following ,",
    "we study the mode entanglement in the zero - mode state .",
    "first of all , we define two spacial - mode states @xmath87  and @xmath88 , i.e. , @xmath89where @xmath90  is the dirac normalizing constant and @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath92  is the field operator for spatial mode @xmath93 , @xmath94 ,  i.e. , @xmath95  and @xmath96 . here@xmath97and the spacial mode states defined in eqs . ( [ spacial_a ] ) and ( spacial_b ) are introduced to characterize the entanglement feature of the zero - mode states , the formalism of which is adopted and studied in ref .",
    "heaney . and",
    "these two spacial mode states could construct a target entangled state @xmath98 , which can be used to judge the degree of entanglement of the zero - mode state of @xmath6 .    taking * *  * * @xmath99 ,",
    "the zero - mode state can be written as@xmath100which is a maximal entanglement .",
    "when we measure the state of the subsystem @xmath101 @xmath102 , it will collapse to either @xmath103  or @xmath104 , i.e. , when @xmath105  is detected at @xmath101 , party @xmath94 must collapse to empty state @xmath106 .",
    "however , such an entangled state is not useful for teleportation in quantum information processing , since the particle probability may not distribute locally .",
    "an interesting fact is that , for @xmath107 , but small @xmath48 , we still have @xmath108i.e .",
    ", the zero - mode state is a highly entangled state for the localized spacial - mode states .    and here we introduce the quantity@xmath109to characterize the entanglement of a zero - mode state for the situation with parameters @xmath21 , @xmath110 , and @xmath48 . a simple derivation yields@xmath111which is close to @xmath112  for @xmath113 .",
    "itindicates that a system with @xmath114  can achieve a perfect entangled state .",
    "entanglement naturally exists in the zero - mode state , which is protected by the band gap .",
    "the question in practice is how to create such a state .",
    "recently , generation scheme of several typical entangled states has been proposed by the dynamical process  near the ep of non - hermitian systems tony1,tony2,lc .",
    "the key to the scheme is based on the fact that a pseudo - hermitian system has real eigenvalues or conjugate pair complex eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "considering the situation in this work that the single zero - mode state splits to a pair of eigenstates with conjugate complex eigenvalues and the @xmath7 symmetry of those eigenstates have been broken , when we tune the potential to @xmath115 .",
    "this pair of states are very close to the zero - mode state , in the sense of that they are still long - range entangled states .",
    "a seed state is an initial state consisting of various eigenstates with their eigenvalues including zero , positive , and negative imaginary parts , respectively . as time evolution , the amplitude of the state with positive imaginary part among the eigenvalues will increase exponentially and suppress that of other components .",
    "the target is the final steady state , which can be regarded as the zero - mode state in the point of view of dirac product .",
    "the initial state is taken as @xmath116 , and the evolved state @xmath117  is expected to close to the target state @xmath118 for a sufficient long time . whether the hamiltonian operator @xmath6  is hermitian or not , an evolved vector @xmath119  should always be the solution of the schrodinger equation@xmath120and the solution has the form@xmath121which can be computed by using a uniform mesh in the time discretization for method .",
    "of course , by taking the biorthogonal inner product instead of the dirac inner product in order to guarantee the unitary time - evolution of the wave functions in a non - hermitian hamiltonian , one can also compute the time evolution by expanding the initial state in terms of the complete set of biorthonormal energy eigenstates .",
    "we employ the fidelity@xmath122to characterize the efficiency of the scheme . here",
    "@xmath123  is the dirac normalized state of @xmath124 to reduce the increasing norm of @xmath119 . in order to quantitatively evaluate the fidelity and demonstrate the proposed scheme",
    ", we simulate the dynamic process of the state @xmath125 preparation .",
    "we plot the profiles of @xmath123  at several typical instants and the fidelity @xmath126 in fig .",
    "we see that the perfect edge state @xmath127 spreads out rapidly at the beginning and converges to the target state with a high fidelity after a long time .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the midgap zero - mode state in a non - hermitian discrete system .",
    "the exact result for a dimerized tight - binding chain with two end imaginary potentials substantiates the existence of coalescing zero - mode state .",
