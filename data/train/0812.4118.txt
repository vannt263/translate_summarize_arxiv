    "quantum mechanics , in contrast to other theories of physics , has interpretations .",
    "moreover it has many interpretations .",
    "the quantum mechanics , or to be more precise quantum formalism , describes , in contrast to other physical theories , no unique reality but only phenomena . by definition , a phenomenon ( from greek @xmath0 , pl .",
    "@xmath1 - phenomena ) is any occurrence that is observable .",
    "in other words a phenomenon is that what we can observe . for centuries",
    "scientists believed that phenomena reveal elements of an objective reality and the aim of the theory is a description of this objective reality .",
    "the theory describing the unique objective reality can not have interpretations .",
    "it can describe the reality correctly or not correctly , and there can be no interpretation whatever .",
    "but quantum phenomena turned out so paradoxical that no universally recognized interpretation of they as manifestation of an unique objective reality can be created up to now . the quantum formalism created by planck , einstein ,",
    "bohr , heisenberg , de broglie , schrodinger , born and others has been enormously successful in describing numerous quantum phenomena .",
    "but there is no generally accepted answer on the question : `` what could these quantum phenomena manifest ? ''",
    "the absence of such answer provoked discussion between albert einstein @xcite and niels bohr @xcite , which is in progress among expersts up to now , in particular at the vaxjo conferences @xcite .",
    "these discussions and the plurality of interpretations point out to our incomprehension of subject of the universally recognized quantum description . in this work",
    "i would like first of all to expand the region of this incomprehension .",
    "the quantum formalism was developed for description of atomic phenomena and the controversy about its interpretation concerned for the present exclusively this level @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic quantum phenomena , such as superconductivity and superfluidity , were not touched upon almost .",
    "there can be no doubt that superconductivity and superfluidity are quantum phenomena .",
    "but could we be sure that the principles of quantum formalism challenging to local realism , such as superposition and wave function collapse , can be applied to these phenomena ?",
    "could we be sure that the ginzburg - landau wave function describing superconducting state has the same nature as the schrodinger wave function ? in order to answer on these questions",
    "i will compare the bohm s quantum potential , introduced in 1952 @xcite , and the quantum force in superconductor , introduced in 2001 @xcite , and will consider the ahronov - bohm effects @xcite in the two - slit interference experiment and in superconductor ring .",
    "the non - universality revealed in fundamental difference between the schrodinger and ginzburg - landau wave functions may be general feature of the quantum formalism as phenomenological theory .",
    "the schrodinger wave function @xmath2 was introduced 1926 for description of atomic phenomena and the ginzburg - landau one @xmath3 was introduced 1950 @xcite for description of superconductivity phenomena .",
    "the both theories are phenomenological as well as the whole quantum formalism .",
    "the both wave functions have allowed to describe the discrete spectrum , the first one of atom and the second one of superconductor ring .",
    "the phase @xmath4 of the wave functions has the same interpretation in the both theories : @xmath5 is the canonical momentum of a particle with a mass @xmath6 and a charge @xmath7 in the presence of a magnetic vector potential @xmath8 .",
    "but in contrast to the born s interpretation the @xmath9 value is no a probability but a density @xmath10 . when the density is constant in the space @xmath11 the superconducting current density @xcite @xmath12 may be written as the product @xmath13 of the density @xmath14 of particles with a charge @xmath7 and their velocity @xmath15 .",
    "landau wrote the relation ( 2 ) as far back as 1941 , in the work @xcite explaining superfluidity phenomena .",
    "the relation ( 2 ) together with the gl wave function allows to describe the majority of the macroscopic quantum phenomena observed in superconductors .",
    "since the complex wave function @xmath3 must be single - valued at any point in the superconductor , its phase @xmath4 must change by integral multiples @xmath16 following a complete turn along the path @xmath17 of integration and consequently @xmath18 the relation ( 3 ) is the quantization of the angular momentum postulated by bohr as far back as 1913 .",
    "according to the relations ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and @xmath19 the integral of the current density along any closed path inside superconductor @xmath20 must be connected with the integral quantum number @xmath21 and the magnetic flux @xmath22 inside the closed path @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath23 is the quantity generally referred to as the london penetration depth @xcite ; @xmath24 for most superconductors",
    "@xcite ; @xmath25 is the quantity called flux quantum . according to ( 4 ) and the maxwell equation @xmath26 the current density decreases strongly inside superconductor @xmath27 where the coordinate @xmath28 run from the surface ( at @xmath29 ) into the interior @xmath30 of the superconductor with the radius @xmath31 .",
    "the flux quantization @xmath32 discovered experimentally in 1961 @xcite is observed since @xmath33 inside superconductor @xmath34 according to ( 5 ) .",
    "the meissner effect i.e. the expulsion of magnetic flux @xmath22 from the interior of a superconductor , discovered by meissner and ochsenfeld in 1933 @xcite , may be considered as a particular case @xmath35 of the flux quantization @xmath36 .",
    "the quantum number @xmath21 must be equal zero when the wave function @xmath3 has no singularity inside @xmath17 , since the radius @xmath28 of the integration path @xmath37 can be decreased down to zero in this case .",
    "the meissner effect is first macroscopic quantum phenomenon observed experimentally .",
    "much more marvellous one is observed in the abrikosov state discovered experimentally as far back as 1935 @xcite and described theoretically by a.a .",
    "abrikosov in 1957 @xcite .",
    "the magnetic flux can penetrate the interior of type - ii superconductor with the abrikosov vortex @xcite which is the singularity of the gl wave function corresponding to @xmath38 in ( 3 ) .",
    "numerous direct observations @xcite give evidence that @xmath32 in any macroscopic region , where @xmath22 and @xmath21 are the magnetic flux and the number of the abrikosov vortices observed inside @xmath17 .",
    "the flux quantization @xcite and the meissner effect @xcite are observed at strong screening when the wall thickness @xmath39 , where @xmath31 and @xmath40 are the outside and inside radius of cylinder or ring . at weak screening @xmath41 the quantization of the persistent current @xcite @xmath42 ( 4 ) or the velocity @xmath43 of superconducting pairs @xmath44",

    "the numerous observations @xcite of the @xmath47 at @xmath51 agree with theory @xcite obtained in the limits of the universally recognized quantum formalism .",
    "but the observations of the direct circular current @xmath52 at @xmath51 and @xmath53 display obvious absent of the force balance .",
    "the conventional direct circular current @xmath54 can be observed a long time at @xmath51 only at a non - zero faraday s voltage @xmath55 , when the force @xmath56 of the electric field @xmath57 counterbalances the dissipation force .",
    "this current in a ring with an inductance @xmath58 and a resistance @xmath51 must disappear during the relaxation time @xmath59 at @xmath53 .",
    "but the persistent current does not disappear . moreover the permanent potential difference @xmath60 is observed on a system of asymmetric rings @xcite .",
    "it is observed in @xcite that the persistent current @xmath47 flows against the electric field @xmath61 in one of the semi - rings because of the absence of the faraday s circular electric field @xmath62 at @xmath53 . the potential electric field @xmath61 is directed , for example , from left to right at @xmath63 in the both semi - rings whereas the clockwise ,",
    "for example , persistent current is directed from left to right in the upper semi - ring but from right to left in the lower semi - ring @xcite .",
    "the challenge to the force balance , @xmath64 at @xmath53 , in the case of superconductor ring is observed only in a narrow critical region @xmath65 near the transition into the normal state @xmath66 where thermal fluctuation or external noise switch ring segments between superconducting @xmath67 , @xmath68 and normal @xmath69 , @xmath70 states . at lower temperature @xmath71 , in superconducting state when @xmath67 all time , @xmath52 but @xmath72 whereas at higher temperature @xmath73",
    "when @xmath69 all time @xmath51 but @xmath74 .",
    "the circular current should vanish @xmath75 and the potential difference @xmath76 should be observed during the relaxation time @xmath77 when any ring segment @xmath78 will be switched in the normal state @xmath69 with a resistance @xmath79 .",
    "the pair velocity @xmath43 in the segment @xmath80 remaining in superconducting state decreases in accordance with the newton s law @xmath81 because of the force @xmath56 of the potential electric field @xmath82 .",
    "the velocity @xmath43 should return to the initial value @xmath83 because of the quantization ( 6 ) after the return of the ring segment @xmath78 in the superconducting state .",
    "this force - free velocity change can explain the absence of the force balance revealed at the @xmath84 and @xmath85 observations @xcite .",
    "the pair angular momentum changes from @xmath86 in the state with the unclosed wave function when @xmath87 to @xmath88 ( 3 ) in the state with the closed wave function .",
    "this change equals @xmath89 at each closing of the wave function and @xmath90 in a time unity at switching between superconducting states with different connectivity of the wave function with a frequency @xmath91 .",
    "the momentum change in a time unity @xmath92 because of the bohr quantization ( 3 ) was called quantum force in @xcite .    the quantum force (",
    "8) is not equal zero because of the strong discreteness of permitted state spectrum of superconducting ring @xmath93 since the pair number @xmath94 is very great in real superconductor ring @xcite .",
    "the average value @xmath95 of the quantum number @xmath21 is close to the integer number @xmath21 corresponding to minimum energy , i.e. the minimum of the @xmath96 value @xcite .",
    "therefore sign and value of the quantum force @xmath97 , as well as @xmath47 are periodical function of the magnetic flux @xmath48",
    "with period equal the flux quantum @xmath49 . the circular quantum force @xmath92 takes the place of the circular faraday s electric field @xmath98 and reestablishes the force balance .",
    "the voltage oscillations @xmath60 observed in @xcite was predicted @xcite as consequence of a reiterate switching of the same ring segment into the normal state with a frequency @xmath99 . according to ( 7 ) the voltage average in time should be equal @xmath100 at a low frequency @xmath101 and @xmath102 at a high frequency @xmath103 .",
    "the quantum force describes only but can not explain the force - free momentum transfer @xmath104 observed at closing of superconducting state .",
    "the force - free momentum transfer @xcite was revealed in the aharonov - bohm effect considered for the case of the two - slit interference experiment as far back as 1959 @xcite .",
    "aharonov and bohm @xcite have attracted considerable attention to the problem of the quantum effects of the electromagnetic fluxes @xcite .",
    "therefore many authors consider such effects , including the little - parks effect @xcite and the persistent current @xcite , as the ahronov - bohm effect .",
    "the consideration of the ahronov - bohm effect in the two - slit interference experiment and in superconducting ring is most suitable way in order to understand the fundamental difference between the quantum force in superconductor @xcite and the bohm quantum potential @xcite .",
    "the aharonov - bohm effects result directly from the universally recognized interpretation ( 1 ) of the wave function phase @xmath4 .",
    "but it is no coincidence that this effect was described @xcite by bohm who have introduced the quantum potential @xcite .",
    "the ahronov - bohm effect demonstrates a non - local force - free momentum transfer @xcite , which can be described @xcite with help of the non - local quantum potential introduced by bohm .",
    "y. aharonov and d. bohm considered two versions of the effect of the electromagnetic potential on the two - slit interference pattern : a magnetic and an electric @xcite . in the magnetic version a magnetic solenoid situated between the two slits ( fig .",
    "1 ) produces within it a magnetic flux @xmath22 .",
    "the probability @xmath105 to finding the particle with a charge @xmath7 ( for example electron with @xmath106 ) at a point @xmath107 of the detector screen should depend on the magnetic flux @xmath22 since the phase difference @xmath108 ( see fig.1 ) according to ( 1 ) .",
    "the shift in phase @xmath109 observed in the shift of the interference pattern @xmath110 ( 9 ) may be interpreted as momentum transfer since @xmath111 .",
    "this transfer is non - local since the particle never enters the region containing magnetic field and it is force - free since magnetic flux is constant in time @xmath53 .",
    "the ahronov - bohm effects in the two - slit interference experiment ( on the left ) and in superconductor ring ( on the right ) are consequence of the magnetic flux @xmath22 influence on the phase difference @xmath112 . in the first case",
    "the difference @xmath113 of the phase changes between @xmath114 and @xmath107 points along upper ( 1 ) way @xmath115 and lower ( 2 ) way @xmath116 should not be divisible by @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) since the schrodinger wave function collapses at particle observation in the two - slit interference experiment .",
    "in contrast to the interference experiment the ahronov - bohm effects in superconductor ring ( for instance the persistent current ) are observed since the gl wave function can not collapse and therefore @xmath119 . ]",
    "the phase difference ( 10 ) can have any value since the schrodinger wave function collapses in the interference experiment and therefore @xmath120 and @xmath121 must not be single - valued at the same point @xmath107 , @xmath122 and therefore @xmath118 .",
    "the ahronov - bohm effect in the two - slit interference experiment and the persistent current are observed because of the same relation ( 1 ) .",
    "we can describe superconducting state in two halves of the ring , fig.1 , with two gl wave functions @xmath123 and @xmath124 as well as in the interference experiment .",
    "but we should write @xmath125 both for the @xmath114 and @xmath107 points since the gl wave function can not collapse and therefore it must be single - valued at any point .",
    "just therefore , see the quantization ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , ( 6 ) , the persistent current and other macroscopic quantum phenomena , i.e. the ahronov - bohm effects in superconductor ring , are observed .",
    "the collapse of the schrodinger wave function at measurement was postulated by von neumann ( von neumann s projection postulate ) @xcite .",
    "but physics is empirical science .",
    "therefore it is more important that the collapse of wave function can be observed , for example , in the two - slit interference experiment .",
    "it is observed , for example in @xcite , that electron passes through two - slits as a de broglie wave with wavelength @xmath126 ( otherwise the interference pattern ( 9 ) could not be observed ) which collapses in a point @xmath107 on the detector screen at electron observation .",
    "the collapse of the schrodinger wave function is observed in many phenomena .",
    "but no macroscopic quantum phenomena gives evidence of any wave function collapse at observation .",
    "moreover , the collapse of the wave function representing no a probability @xmath127 but the real density @xmath10 seems impossible in essence . the density of superconducting pairs @xmath14 can not change because of our look .      the density @xmath10 can be change because of a real physical cause , for example a heating .",
    "we can heat , for example , a small segment @xmath128 of the superconductor ring shown on fig.1 up to @xmath129 .",
    "there is fundamental difference between our possibility in atom and in superconductor ring @xcite .",
    "both the persistent current in superconductor ring and the stationary orbits in atom are observed because of the bohr s quantization ( 3 ) .",
    "but in contrast to atom we can enough easily switch superconductor ring between states with different connectivity of the gl wave function .",
    "after a heating of only small segment @xmath128 , for example near the point 2 on fig.1 , up to @xmath129 the circular current @xmath130 and the pair velocity @xmath131 in all points of other segment @xmath132 , including the point 1 , should decrease down to zero in accordance with the relaxation law ( 7 ) . in this case the @xmath131 value changes because of the real force @xmath133 in agreement with the newton s law .",
    "but the reverse change of the velocity from @xmath87 to @xmath45 is force - free .",
    "this reverse change must be because of the quantization ( 6 ) after a cooling of the @xmath78 segment down to @xmath134 .",
    "this force - free momentum transfer @xmath135 is non - local since an action in the point 2 affects on the velocity @xmath43 and current @xmath136 in the distant point 1 without any field .",
    "the bohm s quantum potential and the quantum force in superconductor can describe the non - local force - free momentum transfer revealed with the aronov - bohm effects .",
    "but the quantum force in superconductor differs in essence from the bohm s quantum potential because of the different essence of the gl and schrodinger wave functions @xcite .",
    "both wave functions describe quantum phenomena but they can not be universally interpreted . the consideration of macroscopic quantum phenomena together with other one should convince anybody that quantum phenomena can not have an universally interpretation and quantum principles can not be applied universally .",
    "for example , macroscopic quantum phenomena refute the universality of the correspondence principle .",
    "this principle formulated by niels bohr states that the predictions of quantum mechanics reduce to those of classical physics when a system moves to higher energies .",
    "how have be able macroscopic quantum phenomena to violate this principle ?",
    "the quantum interference of fullerenes and biomolecules with size up to @xmath137 was observed recently @xcite and zeilinger considered @xcite a possibility of the interference experiment with viruses and nanobacteria .",
    "could we observe the quantum interference of larger systems ?      in order to observe the two - slit interference pattern of particle with size @xmath139 its period @xmath140 should be larger @xmath139",
    ". a slit width and a distance between slits @xmath141 can not be smaller the particle size @xmath139 .",
    "therefore the distance @xmath58 between the double - slit screen and the detector screen , fig.1 , should be larger than @xmath142 .",
    "particles pass this distance during a time @xmath143 at a velocity @xmath43 .",
    "therefore the interference experiment should take a time @xmath144 since the de broglie wavelength @xmath145 and the particle mass @xmath146 .",
    "the value @xmath147 at the typical mass density @xmath148 of all matter including viruses and bacteria .",
    "thus , the interference of particle with @xmath149 can be observed at @xmath150 and the interference experiment at the particle size @xmath151 should take @xmath152 year , @xmath153 - @xmath154 years ; @xmath155 - @xmath156 years and so on .      in order to observe the bohr s quantization of a particle with a mass @xmath6 in a ring with radius @xmath28 the energy difference between permitted states ( 6 ) @xmath157 must exceed the energy of thermal fluctuation @xmath158 .",
    "the discrete spectrum with @xmath159 of single electron @xmath160 in a ring with radius @xmath161 can be observed only at very low temperature @xmath162 .",
    "therefore first attempts to observe the persistent current in normal metal and semiconductor rings with @xmath163 were made only twenty years ago @xcite .",
    "recently the persistent current was observed in semiconductor rings with @xmath164 at the temperature up to @xmath165 @xcite .",
    "but we have not the ghost of a chance to observe the discrete spectrum in a ring of even virus with @xmath166 .",
    "since the ring radius @xmath28 should exceed the virus size @xmath139 the temperature of the experiment should be unachievable low @xmath167 at @xmath168 .",
    "thus , the estimations show that the correspondence principle should be valid .",
    "but in spite of these estimations macroscopic quantum phenomena , superconductivity and superfluidity , are observed .",
    "superconductivity was discovered in 1911 by heike kamerlingh onnes and superfluidity of @xmath169 liquid was discovered after 26 years by pyotr kapitsa .",
    "first successful description was proposed for superfluidity in 1941 by lev landau @xcite .",
    "landau accentuated in @xcite that the bose - einstein condensation , described in 1925 , can not explain the superfluidity phenomena . in order to describe this macroscopic quantum phenomena he postulated an spectrum of excitations with energy gap .",
    "there is important to accentuate that no excitation of individual @xmath169 atoms is in this spectrum .",
    "landau postulated virtually that atoms in superfluid @xmath169 can not have individual velocity and superfluid condensate moves as one big particle .",
    "he wrote in @xcite the relation ( 2 ) for superconducting current using virtually this postulate for electrons in superconductor .",
    "there is important to note that this landau s postulate should be applied also for superconducting pairs .",
    "the energy gap of the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer theory @xcite concerns the energy spectrum of electrons but not pairs .",
    "the landau s postulate about superconducting condensate as a one big particle is implied in the ginzburg - landau theory @xcite .",
    "the wave functions of one free electron @xmath170 , where @xmath171 , and superconducting condensate @xmath172 , where @xmath173 , in an one - dimensional ring with the radius @xmath28 look identically . although @xmath174 and @xmath175 none of the @xmath94 pairs has a quantum number @xmath21 different from the other @xmath176 pairs according to the gl theory . but individual pairs do not vanish totally from superconducting phenomena .",
    "the gl theory interpretation of the phase gradient ( 1 ) @xmath177 as the momentum of single pair ( @xmath178 ) but not all @xmath94 pairs ( @xmath179 ) results to the period @xmath180 of the quantum oscillations @xmath47 , @xmath181 , @xmath85 in magnetic field @xmath182 observed in all experiments .",
    "the two particles with mass @xmath183 of all @xmath94 pairs and @xmath6 of single pair implied in the gl theory allow to explain why macroscopic quantum phenomena can be observed .",
    "the difference between the permitted velocity values @xmath184 depends on the mass @xmath6 of single pair ( 6 ) according to ( 1 ) . whereas the energy difference between permitted states @xmath185 depends also on the mass @xmath186 of all @xmath94 pairs since the quantum number @xmath21 of an individual pair can not change according to the landau s postulate .",
    "therefore the discreteness of superconductor ring permitted state spectrum @xmath187 increases with the increase of all three sizes of the ring @xmath188 .",
    "therefore the persistent current is observed in superconductor with how any large sizes .",
    "our comparison of the quantum phenomena described by the schrodinger wave function and gl wave function has revealed non - universality of quantum description . some quantum postulates , the correspondence principle ,",
    "the wave function collapse can not be applied to the description of macroscopic quantum phenomena and the additional landau postulate is needed for this description .",
    "the non - universality may be general rule of whole quantum description .",
    "numerous interpretations prevent to say that the quantum formalism can describe an unique reality and after the violation @xcite of the bell s inequality we can not be sure that quantum phenomena can reflect an unique reality .",
    "anybody who would state about a quantum reality should say what is this reality .",
    "could we be sure that it is a reality of many worlds by everett @xcite and others @xcite , non - local reality by devid bohm or any others ?",
    "we can not demand the universality of quantum principles till we can not be sure that quantum formalism describes an unique reality since the universality demand presupposes an unique subject of description .    many experts interpret the quantum formalism as a description of our knowledge : schrodinger , `` entanglement of our knowledge '' @xcite ; heisenberg , `` the probability function describes ... rather our knowledge about a quantum process '' @xcite ; rudolph peierls , `` the most fundamental statement of quantum mechanics is that the wavefunction represent our knowledge of the system '' @xcite ; caslav brukner and anton zeilinger `` quantum physics is an elementary theory of information '' @xcite ; christopher fuchs , `` the structure of quantum theory has always concerned information '' @xcite . but this information interpretation also can not be universal since it can not be applied to the macroscopic quantum phenomena .",
    "therefore we must admit the positivism point of view that the quantum theory describes only phenomena .",
    "in fact bohr upheld just this point of view .",
    "but he did not follow to the corollaries of this positivism position . if anybody has admitted that quantum mechanics can describe only phenomena he should not demand universality of quantum principles . but bohr upheld in his debate with einstein @xcite and besides this the universality of such principles as complementarity , uncertainty relation and others .      the bell s experiments @xcite have revealed violation one of the epr assumptions @xcite , on the existence of the elements of the physical reality or locality .",
    "but it is not correct to conclude that these experiments have proved the universality of the uncertainty principle .",
    "andrei khrennikov states in @xcite that `` ( at least in theoretical models ) ... the heisenberg uncertainty principle can be violated '' .",
    "this statement can be corroborate by a very simple gedankenexperiment which can be made real . the resent",
    "experiment @xcite has corroborated the heisenberg uncertainty relation for the coordinate @xmath189 and the velocity @xmath190 of fullerene molecules across their motion along @xmath191 .",
    "but this result can not mean that this relation will be valid also for the coordinate @xmath191 and the velocity @xmath192 along the motion direction .",
    "moreover it seems obvious that the coordinate @xmath191 and the velocity @xmath192 can be measured simultaneously with any exactness . in order to find the velocity @xmath193 we should measure two time moments @xmath194 , @xmath195 and two coordinates @xmath196 , @xmath197 .",
    "the velocity @xmath192 can not change between these measurements at the free flying because of the law of momentum @xmath198 conservation .",
    "therefore the differences @xmath199 and @xmath200 can be made how any large and much larger any measurement inaccuracy of the time moments @xmath201 and the coordinates @xmath202 .",
    "we can take @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 , @xmath206 .",
    "the velocity value @xmath207 can be measured with the uncertainty @xmath208 at @xmath209 , @xmath210 and the product of the velocity @xmath211 and coordinate @xmath212 uncertainties @xmath213 can be made how any small since the @xmath191 and @xmath214 values can be made how any large .",
    "thus , the heisenberg uncertainty relation @xmath215 should be violated if we use the method of the velocity measurement learned in the primary school .",
    "this method may be used in an actual experiment and in order to verify the uncertainty relation no enormous distance is needed .",
    "the value @xmath216 for the fullerene molecules @xmath217 used in @xcite .",
    "the product @xmath218 at the velocity @xmath219 and the measurement inaccuracy of coordinates @xmath220 in the actual experiment @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty relation should violated according to ( 13 ) at @xmath221 and @xmath222 , i.e. at the values accessible for an actual experiment @xmath223 ( in @xcite @xmath224 ) and @xmath225 at @xmath226 .",
    "bohr postulated the complementarity when he has despaired of quantum world realism .",
    "this bohr s principle has formulated the renunciation of the reality description as the goal of quantum theory .",
    "therefore it can not be universal in principle .",
    "nevertheless most physicists following bohr believe in its universality .",
    "only some experts discuss the essence of complementarity @xcite and some authors @xcite challenge this principle .",
    "arkady plotnitsky @xcite considering `` perhaps bohr s most refined formulation of what he means by the complementary situations of measurement '' given in @xcite formulates bohr s complementarity principle as follows : `` in considering complementary conjugate variables in question in quantum mechanics ( in contrast to those of classical physics ) we deal with two mutually exclusive experimental arrangements , each providing complete ( actual ) information about the two states of the two quantum objects involved in such measurements '' .",
    "the position @xmath191 and momentum @xmath198 are referred as example of `` complementary conjugate variables '' in the `` bohr s most refined formulation '' @xcite .",
    "but the actual experimental arrangements of the school method considered above are not merely mutually non - exclusive for measurement of position and momentum .",
    "they are the same .",
    "we should conclude that either the method of the momentum measurement @xmath227 learned in the primary school is not correct ( but why ? ! ) or the bohr s complementarity principle is not universal .",
    "einstein upheld the principle of realism and he stated that the quantum theory had relinquished precisely what has always been the goal of science : `` the complete description of any ( individual ) real situation ( as it supposedly exists irrespective of any act of observation or substantiation ) '' @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this bohr stated that all hope of attaining a unified picture of objective reality must be abandoned . according to his point of view quantum theory",
    "would provide predictions concerning the results of measurements but , unlike all previous theories , it was incapable of providing a full account of `` how nature did it . ''",
    "bohr argued that the very desire to seek such a complete account was misguided and naive : `` there is no quantum world .",
    "there is only an abstract quantum physical description .",
    "it is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how nature is '' ( the citation from @xcite ) .",
    "most physicists agree rather with bohr than einstein since we have no `` hope of attaining a unified picture of objective reality '' of quantum world up to now .",
    "but most physicists remain in fact naive partisan of the realism point of view since it is difficult to renounce really the centuries - old realistic point of view with all that it implies . if anybody has admitted that `` there is no quantum world '' he should not think that quantum description must be universal .",
    "but most physicists are sure that quantum principles must be universal .",
    "for example , most authors are sure that any quantum system with two permitted states @xcite , including superconductor ring @xcite , can be used as quantum bit ( qubit ) , principal element of quantum computer .",
    "qubit , in contrast to classical bit , should operate in state superposition . but how could superconductor ring be in state superposition if the gl wave function can not collapse ?",
    "superposition of states is inconceivable without the collapse since we can not observe anything in two place at the same time .",
    "therefore anthony leggett assuming superposition of superconductor ring states should be to fabricate a new wave function @xcite , which can collapse , in additional to the gl wave function , which can not collapse .",
    "the new wave function was fabricated for superconductor ring but not for the schrodinger cat , for example , because of the logic of universality .",
    "but this logic should not be applied to quantum formalism which is phenomenological theory .",
