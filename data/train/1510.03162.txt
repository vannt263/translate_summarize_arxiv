    "device - to - device ( d2d ) communication , allowing direct communication between nearby users , is envisioned as an innovative feature of 5 g cellular networks  @xcite .",
    "different from ad - hoc networks , the d2d communication is generally established under the control of the base station ( bs ) . in d2d - enabled cellular networks , the cellular and d2d users can share the spectrum resources in two ways : _ in - band _ where d2d communication utilizes the cellular spectrum and _ out - of - band _ where d2d communication utilizes the unlicensed spectrum  @xcite . in - band",
    "d2d can be further divided into two categories : _ overlay _ where the cellular and d2d communications use orthogonal ( i.e. , dedicated ) spectrum resources and _ underlay _ where d2d users share the same spectrum resources occupied by the cellular users .",
    "note that the spectrum sharing in in - band d2d is controlled by the cellular network , which is different than the spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks  @xcite .",
    "underlay in - band d2d communication can greatly improve the spectrum efficiency of cellular networks and is considered in this paper .    [",

    "[ thru ] are plotted using the combination of propositions  2 - 5 , and corollary  [ prop_cue ] . from both figures",
    ", we can see that the analytical results match closely with the simulation results even when the mode selection threshold is small ( i.e. , probability of being due is small ) or the radius of the p - due s transmission range is relatively large ( i.e. , 10@xmath4 of the cell radius ) .",
    "this confirms the accuracy of our derived approximation results .",
    "in addition , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : outagebsandlink ] , both the outage probability at the bs and the average number of successful d2d transmissions increase as the mode selection threshold increases .",
    "this is because as mode selection threshold increases , more p - dues are allowed to be in underlay d2d mode which improves the average number of successful d2d transmissions .",
    "however , the increase in mode selection threshold degrades the outage performance at the bs since more interferers are involved .      fig",
    ".  [ outage_d ] plots the outage probability at a typical drx versus its distance to the bs with different path - loss exponent sets , for @xmath1 m and @xmath2 m , respectively .",
    "the simulation results are also presented and match well with the analytical results , which again validates our analytical results . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ outage_d ] , the outage probability at the drx varies greatly with the drx location , which highlights the importance of characterizing the location - dependent performance .",
    "the general trends are that the outage probability firstly increases as the distance between drx and bs increases and then decreases when the drx is close to the cell - edge .",
    "these trends can be explained as follows . when the drx is close to the bs , there are fewer number of p - dues that are in underlay d2d mode due to the mode selection scheme .",
    "thus , interference is less and the outage probability is low . as the drx gradually moves away from the bs ,",
    "more interfering nodes are present and the outage probability increases",
    ". however , once the drx is close to the cell - edge , the number of interfering dues decreases due to the boundary effect , and the outage probability decreases .      in this subsection",
    ", we investigate the effect of p - due s node density @xmath5 on the average number of successful d2d transmissions and spectrum reuse ratio ( i.e. , the average fraction of dues that can successfully transmit among all dues ) . since both the outage probability at the bs and the average number of successful d2d transmissions are increasing functions of the mode selection threshold @xmath0 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : outagebsandlink ] , we have adopted the following method to investigate the effects of d2d user s density :    * given a qos at the bs , for each p - due s node density @xmath5 , using  ,   and  , we can find the mode selection threshold @xmath0 satisfying the qos at the bs ; * using the mode selection threshold @xmath0 that satisfies the qos at bs , the average number of successful d2d transmissions @xmath6 can be calculated for each @xmath5 .",
    "this obtained @xmath6 value can be regarded as the maximum average number of successful underlay d2d transmission achieved by the system .",
    "we can then work out the corresponding spectrum reuse ratio .",
    "[ link_m ] plots the average number of successful d2d transmissions and spectrum reuse ratio versus the node density of p - dues for qos constraint at the bs @xmath7 and different drx s receiver sensitivity .",
    "we assume the fading on all the links to be rayleigh fading . from figs .",
    "[ link_m1 ] and  [ ratio_m1 ] , we can see that the average number of successful d2d transmissions increases with increasing node density of p - due , however the spectrum reuse ratio decreases .",
    "this trend can be explained as follows . when the node density is higher , the probability of being in d2d mode is reduced to maintain the qos at the bs .",
    "however , the overall node density is large which means that the number of dues is still large .",
    "thus , the average number of successful d2d transmissions , which is mainly affected by the number of dues under this scenario , increases when the node density of p - dues increases .",
    "in contrast , lesser number of dues are likely to transmit successfully when the number of interfering dues is large , which leads to the decreasing trend of spectrum reuse ratio .    from fig .",
    "[ link_m2 ] , we can see that when the receiver sensitivity of drx is smaller than that of bs , increasing p - due s node density beyond a certain limit can degrade the average number of successful d2d transmissions , especially when @xmath8 and @xmath9 have very similar values .",
    "this is due to the fact that the average number of successful d2d transmissions is determined by the number of dues and the outage probability at drx .",
    "when @xmath10 is small , since there is a greater number of interfering dues nearby and the interference from cue can be also severe when @xmath8 and @xmath9 have very similar values , the outage probability at drx is high .",
    "thus , @xmath6 first increases and then decreases .    from fig .",
    "[ ratio_m1 ] , we can see that if @xmath8 is slightly smaller than @xmath9 and @xmath11 is greater than @xmath12 , the decreasing trend for spectrum reuse ratio is almost negligible . in other words , the spectrum reuse ratio can be regarded as almost a constant and it does not degrade with increasing node density of p - due .",
    "under such a case , increasing the p - due s node density is beneficial for underlay d2d communication .      in this subsection",
    "we examine the effect of drx s receiver sensitivity @xmath10 on the average number of successful d2d transmissions and spectrum reuse ratio , adopting the same approach as explained in section  [ results : d ] .",
    "[ link_rhod ] plots the average number of successful d2d transmissions and related spectrum reuse ratio versus the drx s receiver sensitivity with qos constraint at the bs @xmath7 , for different path - loss exponent sets and receiver sensitivity of bs @xmath13 .    from figs .",
    "[ link_rhod1 ] and  [ link_rhod2 ] , we can see that , in general , as the receiver sensitivity decreases the average number of successful d2d transmissions increases at first and then decreases .",
    "these trends can be explained as follows .",
    "the average number of successful d2d transmissions is impacted by both the number of dues and the outage probability at drxs .",
    "when @xmath10 is small , more p - dues are operating in d2d mode because their transmit power is small , so less interference is generated to the bs .",
    "similarly , for the outage probability at drx , although the total number of dues is large , the interference from surrounding dues is not severe due to the small receiver sensitivity .",
    "if we ignore the interference from cue , the number of dues governs the network performance and the average number of successful d2d transmissions increases as the receiver sensitivity decreases .",
    "however , we can not ignore the interference from cue , especially when the value of @xmath8 is large ( i.e. , close to the value of @xmath9 ) .",
    "under such a scenario , the transmit power for cue is large .",
    "moreover , due to the smaller receiver sensitivity at drxs , drxs are more likely to be in outage .",
    "consequently , the interplay of the number of dues and the outage probability at the drx causes the average number of successful d2d transmissions to first increase and then decrease as the receiver sensitivity decreases",
    ".    figs .",
    "[ link_rhod1 ] and  [ link_rhod2 ] also show that for different path - loss exponent sets ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , the maximum value of the average number of successful d2d transmissions occurs at different receiver sensitivity values .",
    "for example , if @xmath14 , @xmath6 reaches its maximum value when the value of @xmath10 is greater than @xmath15 . however , if @xmath8 is smaller than @xmath9 , then a smaller receiver sensitivity of drx results in the maximum @xmath6 .",
    "that is to say , as the value of @xmath8 decreases , the required receiver sensitivity of drx to achieve the maximum average number of successful d2d transmissions becomes smaller .",
    "note that when @xmath15 is far greater than @xmath10 , although all p - dues are in d2d mode , the outage probability at the bs will still be lower than @xmath16 .",
    "hence , @xmath6 can not be computed and the curves are incomplete in figs .",
    "[ link_rhod2 ] and  [ ratio_rhod2 ] for certain cases .    figs .",
    "[ ratio_rhod1 ] and  [ ratio_rhod2 ] show that the spectrum reuse ratio generally decreases as the drx s receiver sensitivity decreases",
    ". additionally , when the path - loss exponent on the cellular link is slightly lower than the path - loss exponent on the d2d link , then the decreasing amount in the spectrum reuse ratio is less for the different cases considered .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a framework to analyze the performance of underlay in - band d2d communication inside a finite cellular region .",
    "we adopted a mode selection scheme for potential d2d users to manage the intra - cell interference experienced by the bs .",
    "using stochastic geometry , we derived approximate yet accurate analytical results for the outage probability at the bs and a typical drx , the average number of successful d2d transmissions and spectrum reuse ratio .",
    "our derived results showed that the outage probability relies strongly on the location of drx .",
    "they also allowed the impact of the d2d system parameters on both the average number of successful d2d transmissions and spectrum reuse ratio to be determined .",
    "for example , it is observed that , given the qos constraint at the bs , as the d2d users node density increases , the spectrum reuse ratio decreases . when the receiver sensitivity of the drx is greater than the receiver sensitivity of the bs , the average number of successful d2d transmissions increases .",
    "moreover , when the path - loss exponent on the cellular link is slightly lower than that on the d2d link , the decreasing trend for spectrum reuse ratio can become negligible .",
    "this indicates that an increasing level of d2d communication can be beneficial in future networks and provides design guidelines in the practical communication systems with d2d communication .",
    "rearranging  , we have the outage probability as @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the fading power gain on the reference link .",
    "since we assume nakagami - m fading with integer @xmath20 for the reference link , @xmath21 follows the gamma distribution with mean 1 and shape parameter @xmath20 , and its cdf is given by @xmath22 .",
    "hence , we can re - write   as @xmath23    note the mgf of @xmath24 is @xmath25 and its @xmath26-th derivative with respect to @xmath27 is @xmath28 . by substituting @xmath29",
    ", we have @xmath30    substituting   into  , we have @xmath31",
