    "scaling hypothesis and the renormalization group theory led to the understanding of universality in critical phenomena , i.e.  the fact that systems that look different at small scales may share , in proximity of critical points , common statistical properties .",
    "this concept greatly reduces the variety of possible critical behavior by grouping all systems into a small number of universality classes characterized by the same critical exponents and critical amplitude ratios . in this respect universality justifies the study of systems in a given universality class that are simple enough to be treated either numerically or analytically .    in statistics of polymer conformations",
    "this approach has been often followed by modeling polymers as self - avoiding walks ( saws ) on discrete lattices such as the simple cubic ( sc ) , the face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) and the body - centered cubic lattice ( bcc ) . for these models",
    "combinatorial arguments and monte carlo simulations can be efficiently applied to obtain rigorous and numerical results on the large scale ( asymptotic ) behavior of polymers in good solution  .",
    "moreover saws can be mapped to a magnetic system at its critical point and studied by renormalization group techniques  @xcite .",
    "this approach has led , for example , to the well established results that the number @xmath2 and the mean squared radius of gyration @xmath3 of @xmath0-steps self - avoiding polygons ( saps , i.e.  @xmath4-steps saws having the two extremities one lattice distance apart ) behave for large @xmath0 respectively as @xmath5 and @xmath6 where the amplitudes @xmath7 , @xmath8 and the connective constant @xmath9 are non universal quantities that depend on the underlying lattice  , while @xmath10 and @xmath11 are universal exponents related by the hyperscaling equation @xmath12 with @xmath13 the dimensionality of the space and @xmath11 the metric exponent . in @xmath14 ,",
    "advanced numerical simulations give @xmath15  @xcite , and hence @xmath16 , in good agreement with field theoretical results  .",
    "also the correction to scaling exponent @xmath17 is believed to be universal and its best estimate is @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "notice that saps on regular lattices model polymer rings in good solution with _ any _ possible topology , i.e.  with an arbitrary number of knots tied in .",
    "however , in most experiments and physical situations such as in melts and concentrated solutions , the overall topology of a system of ring polymers can not be changed unless the excluded volume interaction is violated .",
    "this , for example , has relevant consequences on the temperature of the collapse transition of ring polymers , which is found experimentally to be different from that of their linear counterparts  @xcite .",
    "because of the topological constraint for looped polymers , the above mentioned mapping to a magnetic system is not valid anymore and , consequently , no field theory argument can establish the validity of scaling laws similar to ( [ scal_entropy_sap ] ) and ( [ scal_radius_sap ] ) . on the basis of previous numerical investigations",
    "it is however reasonable to assume @xmath19 and @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are respectively the connective constant and the entropic exponent of the subset of saps with a given knot type @xmath23 . with this notation @xmath23",
    "refers either to prime knots or to composite knots given by the connect sum of prime knots ( roughly speaking , a knot is composite if it can be split in two knots located in different portions of the chain , which are separated by a plane )  .",
    "the case @xmath24 denotes the special case of unknotted saps ( saps with trivial topology ) .",
    "the scaling relations ( [ scal_entropy_knot ] ) and ( [ scal_radius_knot ] ) have been conjectured in analogy with ( [ scal_entropy_sap ] ) and ( [ scal_radius_sap ] ) and their validity has been confirmed so far only by numerical simulations  @xcite with the findings @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29 denote the number of prime components in the knot decomposition  .",
    "the _ probability _ of occurrence of a given knot @xmath23 , @xmath30 is thus dominated by the exponential decay @xmath31 at large @xmath0s . in the following",
    "we will not deal with this aspect but we will focus instead on the scaling beaviour of the ratios @xmath32 .",
    "it is important to stress that the exponent @xmath26 is consistent with the recent finding that prime knots in saps are weakly localized , i.e they occupy on average a portion of the ring that scales as @xmath33 , with @xmath34  @xcite . indeed , given that each prime knot is weakly localized , saps with knot type @xmath23 should , in the large @xmath0 limit , look like as unknotted rings with @xmath29 decorated vertices .",
    "these decorations can sit in @xmath35 positions along the @xmath0-step sap .",
    "the partition function of such decorated chain thus includes a scaling law @xmath36 multiplying the partition function of unknotted chains , whose power - law part scales @xmath37 . similarly , the average extension of each prime component should not contribute , in the large @xmath0 limit , to the overall extension of the knotted sap and one would expect that saps with a fixed knot type @xmath23 would share , to leading order , the same metric properties of unknotted saps  @xcite .    a more recent numerical calculation of saps on the cubic lattice has confirmed and improved the above conjectures by suggesting the validity of the following scaling laws  @xcite @xmath38    where @xmath39 is a coefficient growing with the knot complexity and factorizable into the elementary contributions of each prime component .",
    "roughly speaking @xmath39 can be interpreted as the elementary entropic cost to tie a given knot @xmath23 in a sap and its dependence on @xmath23 can be related to the minimal number of steps necessary to build a knot type @xmath23 on the underlying lattice  @xcite .",
    "note that , for any two prime knots @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the inverse proportionality relation @xmath42 is satisfied .",
    "one of the aims of this work is to explore more deeply the scaling relation ( [ scal_ck ] ) by extending the numerical investigations in  @xcite to saps embedded both on bcc and fcc lattices and to look at the dependence of @xmath39 on these lattices . while the value of @xmath39 should depend on the three - dimensional lattice considered we expect the ratios @xmath43 to be independent on lattice details",
    "this feature has been already suggested in   on the basis of a stochastic enumeration of @xmath0-steps saps performed with the gas algorithm  , an extremely efficient method to sample saps of moderate lengths and with fixed knot type .",
    "note that the conclusions given in   rely on an extrapolation to infinity of the data obtained for saps within the range @xmath44 , i.e. in a region of @xmath0s where , especially for knotted configurations , strong corrections to scaling are expected  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we extend the range of sampled @xmath0 up to @xmath45 by means of efficient monte carlo samplings .",
    "we have been able to compute the amplitudes @xmath39 for different knot types and to confirm , for a wide range of @xmath0 , the universal character of the ratios @xmath46 / @xmath47 found in   although with different asymptotic values .",
    "in addition , by computing the mean squared radius of gyration of each sap , we confirm , within a wide range of @xmath0 , the validity of the scaling law ( [ scal_radius_knot ] ) . finally , as a measure of the geometrical entanglement of knotted saps",
    "we have considered their writhe .",
    "rigorous arguments have shown that , for saps on the cubic lattice , the mean absolute writhe @xmath48 increases at least as rapidly as @xmath49  @xcite and numerical estimates on the same system gives @xmath50 with @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "it is then natural to check whether , for saps with fixed knot type @xmath23 , the scaling law for the spread of the writhe and the exponent @xmath52 are independent either on the knot type @xmath23 or on the underlying lattice .",
    "we perform monte carlo sampling of saps on the sc , bcc and fcc lattices by using the two - point pivot moves , a fixed-@xmath0 algorithm that has been proven to be ergodic in the class of all saps and shown to be efficient in sampling uncorrelated configurations  .",
    "this algorithm allows us to reach values of @xmath0 up to @xmath1 for the bcc and fcc lattice . for the sc lattice instead we use previous data  @xcite including also @xmath53 and @xmath54 . for the longest chains the samples include @xmath55 independent configurations . for @xmath56",
    "this number raises to @xmath57 .",
    "typically @xmath58 data are present for each @xmath0 .    since the pivot algorithm samples saps with any topology , it requires a post processing procedure to characterize the knot type of each configuration .",
    "this is can be determined , for example , by computing a topological invariant such as the jones or the homfly polynomials  @xcite . in general the computational complexity of these invariants increases",
    "exponentially with the geometrical entanglement of the curve and , for very large @xmath0 , this could be the most problematic part of the whole investigation . to overcome this problem we first smooth each configuration by reducing its length while keeping the knot type fixed .",
    "this is achieved by using a nonequilibrium stochastic scheme based on local moves ( a nonequilibrium variant of the bfacf method  ) that trims recursively all kinks in the sap .",
    "in addition the algorithm performs some random local rearrangements to reduce the chance that a fast drop in chain length results into configurations which it is then very unlikely to escape from .",
    "this occurs for example when multiple prime components are present in the sap and the resulting frozen configurations are characterized by having these components separated by stretched portions of the sap that become difficult to shrink .",
    "we find that in most situations the algorithm is able to reach a configuration close to the minimal @xmath0 allowed by its knot type on that specific lattice .",
    "this configuration is then projected along a given ( approximately ) irrational direction and the resulting knot diagram is mapped into the corresponding dowker code  @xcite that is eventually further simplified and factorized into the dowker codes of the prime knots . finally , we compare each component of the original dowker code against a look - up table of dowker codes of prime knots of up to 11 crossings . in this way we have been able to distinguish composite knots with up to 5 prime components and with each prime component having minimal crossing number up to 11 .    as an example of the efficiency of the simplification algorithm we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex ] the result of the step reduction applied to configurations with @xmath59 .",
    "the first two configurations display a @xmath60#@xmath61 knot ( i.e.  a composite knot formed by a prime knot @xmath60 and a prime knot @xmath62 ) , ( a ) on the bcc and ( b ) on the fcc lattice .",
    "one can readily see the @xmath60#@xmath61 knot at these reduced lengths : the @xmath60 part is on the lower - right side and the @xmath61 part on the upper - left one .",
    "the configuration in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex](c ) shows instead a @xmath63#@xmath64 knot ( this a shorthand notation for @xmath60#@xmath60#@xmath60#@xmath60#@xmath64 ) .",
    "all these examples confirm the efficiency of the bfacf method in shrinking the chain from a very long length to a very short one , even for complex composite knots .",
    ".knot costs @xmath39 for the sc , bcc , and fcc lattices , determined from averages of the data @xmath65 in the range @xmath66 ( specific points clearly nonasymptotic for the knots with @xmath67 crossings have also been excluded from the averages ) .",
    "errors refer to one standard deviation .",
    "the ratios @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the last two columns seem to be independent on the knot @xmath23 . [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]      knots , times @xmath70 .",
    "they converge to a lattice - dependent constant ( @xmath71 ) for large @xmath0 .",
    "bands of different colors represent the estimated asymptotic values with @xmath72 error , see table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "( b ) the same for knot @xmath64 .",
    "( c ) ratio of probability of @xmath60 knot and of @xmath64 knot , converging to a constant for large @xmath0 ( @xmath73 ) that does not depend on the lattice kind .",
    "the horizontal lines mark the interval of the estimated asymptotic value , see table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "this panel includes also data at @xmath74 .",
    "note that , while the small @xmath0 deviations from the asymptotic values are due to corrections to scaling , the fluctuations at larger @xmath0 s are originated by limited statistics . [ fig:41],width=309 ]    the bcc and the fcc lattices have coordination number @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively . it could be expected that more neighbors implies more flexibility and thus a more pronounced tendency to form knots .",
    "a manifestation of this effect would be that the knot costs @xmath39 were somewhat inversely proportional to the coordination number .",
    "it turns out that indeed knots are less frequent in saps embedded on the sc lattice and hence @xmath77 is larger than its counterparts for fcc and bcc lattices .",
    "however , for the simplest knots we observe surprisingly that @xmath78 .",
    "according to ( [ scal_ck ] ) this is readily seen by determining @xmath39 from @xmath79 for a simple prime knot .",
    "for instance , by focusing on @xmath80 in [ fig .",
    "[ fig:41](a ) ] and @xmath81 in [ fig .",
    "[ fig:41](b ) ] it is easy to see that these quantities are smaller for saps on the bcc lattice than on the fcc . if we consider instead the ratio @xmath82 [ fig .",
    "[ fig:41](c ) ] we note that , as @xmath0 increases , it approaches an asymptotic value that is independent on the lattice .",
    "this is true also for frequency ratios between other prime knots , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5152 ] and in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "these results support the previously conjectures hypothesis that the frequency ratios between prime knots do not depend on the lattice in which they are embedded  .",
    "our estimates in table  [ tab1 ] and in table  [ tab2 ] differ however from the ones reported in  .",
    "a possible explanation is that the estimates in   are affected by systematic errors due to the small values of @xmath0 considered whose range fall in a region where the corrections to scaling are too strong ( see the data for @xmath74 in fig .  [ fig:41](c ) ) to be neglected .",
    "knot and of ( a ) @xmath61 knot , ( b ) @xmath62 knot .",
    "the horizontal lines represent the estimated asymptotic ratio ( table  [ tab2 ] , last column ) @xmath72 error .",
    "[ fig:5152],width=309 ]    another way of presenting these results is by noticing that the frequencies of prime knots , whose inverse is proportional to the costs @xmath39 , have fairly fixed ratios for different lattices : according to columns 5 and 6 of table  [ tab1 ] , we see indeed that for each knot on the sc there are @xmath83 knots on the bcc , and @xmath84 knots on the fcc ( these values correspond to weighted averages of the columns assuming a constant knot - independent ratio for the two lattices ) .      the case of composite knots formed by @xmath85 topologically equivalent prime knots @xmath23 ( denoted @xmath86 hereafter ) , was recently discussed in  @xcite where the entropic cost @xmath87 was determined in a rather simple way in terms of the corresponding costs necessary to tie its prime components .",
    "since each component is ( weakly ) localized , in the large @xmath0 limit we can think of the chain with knot @xmath86 as an unknotted ring decorated by topologically identical objects ( prime knots ) , each placed in one of @xmath35 available locations .",
    "the entropic cost of each decoration is @xmath39 , and being all independent one would expect that the full cost @xmath87 is simply given by the product of the @xmath88 elementary costs @xmath39",
    ". however , in this picture , being the prime knots topologically identical , they can be interchanged along the chain keeping the configuration undistinguishable .",
    "this property gives rise to a combinatorial factor @xmath89 that needs to be removed from the counting in order to define the relative entropy of the decorated chain with respect to the unknotted one .",
    "this gives @xmath90 for more general composite knots that include groups of different prime knots , the total cost is the product of the cost of each group given by ( [ cristal ] ) .",
    "for trefoil knots on the sc lattice is was shown that ( [ cristal ] ) was fulfilled by an excellent degree of precision  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cristal ] we can see that also on fcc and bcc lattices the data follow the relation @xmath91 with @xmath87 given by ( [ cristal ] ) .",
    "the importance of the factorial term @xmath89 can be understood as follows : since the trefoil is the prime knot with the lower cost @xmath39 , one would first guess that saps with the composite knot @xmath92 are the most abundant ones for @xmath93 .",
    "however , when the cost ratio @xmath94 becomes smaller than @xmath88 , because of the factorial factor @xmath88 ! , configurations with knot @xmath95#@xmath64 are more frequent than those hosting the knot @xmath92 . since @xmath96 this means that the combinatorial entropy loss should start to become relevant for a number of prime components @xmath97 , which corresponds to @xmath98 , i.e.  chain lengths ( for example , @xmath99 on the bcc lattice ) that are impossible to test numerically .",
    "hence , we can safely expect trefoils to dominate the knot statistics for realistic polymer rings in good solvent regime .     vs.  @xmath0 , for multiple trefoil knots , in ( a ) the bcc lattice and ( b ) the fcc lattice .",

    "[ fig : rg ] we report these ratios as a function of @xmath105 for @xmath103  @xcite and for different knot types : one can readily see that these ratios converge ( as @xmath110 ) to a common value , independent on the knot type .",
    "this supports the expectation that @xmath111 is the same for all knots  @xcite and confirms indirectly the weak localization property of the knotted portion of the chain  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath111 does however depend on the chosen lattice and is larger on the bcc [ @xmath112 , see fig .",

    "[ fig : sigma_wr],title=\"fig:\",width=309 ]    the writhe of a curve is a quantity that describe its geometrical self - entanglement . a commonly used algorithm to compute",
    "the writhe of a curve goes as follows : first , one projects the curve onto an arbitrary plane . in general",
    "the projection will have crossings that most of the time will be transverse , so that , after having established an orientation of the curve , a sign @xmath115 or @xmath116 ( determined by a right hand rule ) can be assigned to each crossing .",
    "the sum of these signs gives the signed crossing number in this projection .",
    "the writhe of the curve is obtained by averaging these signed crossing numbers over all possible projections . from this definition",
    "it is clear that the main difficulty in computing the writhe of a configuration would be the averaging procedure over all projections .",
    "fortunately , for polygons on sc , fcc and bcc this procedure is enormously simplified by theorems @xcite which reduce the computation of writhe to the average of linking numbers of the given curve with a finite set of selected push - offs of the curve itself . in our calculation of the writhe we made extensive use of these results .",
    "clearly the writhe of saps is , on average , zero and , provided we do not distinguish mirror images in chiral knots , this is still true for saps with fixed knot type .",
    "the simplest non trivial observable for the writhe distribution of saps with knot type @xmath23 is then its standard deviation @xmath117 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_wr ] we report the log - log plot of several @xmath117 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "different symbols refer to different knot types and it is readily seen that , for sufficiently long @xmath0 all data converge to a common curve that is essentially the one for unknotted saps .",
    "we can then argue that , similarly to saps in the sc lattice  @xcite , and for all the knots considered here @xmath118 , both for fcc and bcc lattices .",
    "a simple linear fit of the log - log data gives estimates @xmath119 , @xmath120 for bcc and @xmath121 , @xmath122 for the fcc .",
    "these estimates are quite consistent with the estimate @xmath123 found for the sc lattice  @xcite .",
    "this is not true , however , for the amplitude @xmath124 whose estimate in the sc ( @xmath125 ) differs from the ones shown above for the other two lattices .",
    "similar results are found for the absolute value of the writhe ( exponent @xmath126 on the bcc and @xmath127 on the fcc ) , which is expected , given the regular shape of the writhe distribution  @xcite .",
    "two features are worth noticing : firstly the estimate of @xmath128 is very close to the lower bound @xmath129 proved rigorously for saps with free topology in the sc lattice  @xcite .",
    "secondly the deviation from the scaling law experienced by saps with fixed knot type is less pronounced for the figure - eight and the unknot ( achiral ) then for all the others knots that are chiral .",
    "this is related to the nonzero mean writhe of each of the two images of a chiral knot , see  @xcite .",
    "since renormalization group arguments are not applicable to the statistical ensembles of rings with fixed knot type , we have resorted to simulations to investigate the universal features of the scaling laws for the entropic , metric and geometrical properties of knotted saps .",
    "we have confirmed that frequencies of knots in saps depend on the lattice in which the configurations are embedded , on the other hand the ratios between knot frequencies are lattice - independent numbers and depend only on the knot types involved .",
    "surprisingly , knotted configurations are more frequent on the bcc than on the fcc lattice .",
    "this finding is unexpected because the fcc lattice has a higher coordination number than the bcc one , and because the knots with the shortest number of steps are found in the fcc lattice  .",
    "we have also supported the conjecture that composite knots in saps appear with frequencies that , in the large @xmath0 limit , can be inferred from those of the prime knots in the knot decomposition .",
    "this property was conjectured for polygons on the cubic lattice  @xcite and here is confirmed also for saps on the bcc and fcc lattices .",
    "the composite _ knot cost _ includes a factorial @xmath89 for every group of @xmath88 identical prime knots , which multiplies the @xmath88-th power of their cost .",
    "the factorial term is suitable to properly take into account the combinatorial entropic loss for identical prime components in the picture where , in the large @xmath0 limit , each prime component behaves as a decorating point along the unknotted ring . as a byproduct",
    "one can predict that , for chain lengths @xmath130 , knots with the highest frequency include not only trefoil knots but also other prime knots .    concerning the metric properties of saps with fixed topology",
    ", our results for all the three lattices considered confirm that not only does the mean squared radius of gyration share the usual power law @xmath102 known for the set of all saps but also the amplitude @xmath111 does not depend on the knot type @xmath23  @xcite , see ( [ scal_radius_knot ] ) .",
    "the dependence on the knot type is however present at the level of the corrections to scaling , which become more pronounced as the knot complexity of the saps increases .",
    "finally we have shown that the large @xmath0 scaling behavior of the variance of the writhe ( or equivalently its absolute value ) for saps with knot type @xmath23 is independent both on @xmath23 and lattice type and is very close to @xmath49 , which is the lower bound proved by rigorous arguments for the class of all saps on the sc lattice  @xcite .    by universality",
    "it is reasonable to expect that most of the features shown here for saps on lattices can be valid also for other models of polymer rings in which the excluded volume interaction is taken into account . on the other hand preliminary studies on the knot probability for off - lattice rings have either neglected completely the excluded volume interaction  @xcite or looked at the knot probability amplitudes for few and rather small values of @xmath0   . in the near future",
