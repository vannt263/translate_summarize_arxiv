    "@xmath17 will be referred to as the _ base - space_. it was shown in @xcite that supersymmetry requires @xmath14 to be a function on @xmath17 , @xmath15 to be a one - form on @xmath17 and that the base - space be a hyper - khler manifold .",

    "we will import a class of @xmath22 invariant khler metrics from the mathematics literature @xcite .",
    "the metrics are given in darboux or symplectic co - ordinates ; in these co - ordinates _ all the metrics in the class have the same khler form _ , whilst the complex structures can be different .",
    "we find in this class two important metrics : * 1 . * the base - space metric for the susic flat ring and * 2 . * the base - space metric for @xmath1 , i.e. the bergmann metric .",

    "the expectation that a supersymmetric @xmath0 ring should have a @xmath22 isometry , similar to the susic flat ring , leads us to look for khler metrics preserving a @xmath22 isometry .",

    "toric khler _ metrics .",
    "more precisely , a toric khler metric is a khler metric admitting commuting holomorphic killing vector fields which are independent .",

    "the study of khler metrics in symplectic co - ordinates is attributed to the mathematicians , guillemin @xcite and abreu @xcite .",
    "symplectic co - ordinates also appear naturally in the context of the gauged linear sigma model @xcite . here , we reproduce the relevant proposition from @xcite . * proposition*. _ let @xmath28 be a positive definite @xmath29 symmetric matrix of functions of 2-variables @xmath30 and @xmath31 with inverse @xmath32",

    "the authors of @xcite derive their motivation to consider co - ordinates and to focus on the ortho - toric sub - class of toric khler metrics from their study of what are called _ weakly self - dual _ khler metrics .",
    "a weakly self - dual k \" ahler metric is a khler metric whose anti - self - dual part of the weyl tensor is harmonic , ( after having fixed the underlying orientation to make the khler form self - dual . ) a weakly self - dual khler metric has many important properties , one of which is that two particular functions built out of the metric are poisson - commuting holomorphic potentials ( a holomorphic potential is the moment map of a hamiltonian killing vector field . )",

    "when expressed in coordinates related to the holomorphic potentials , @xmath65 it turns out that a weakly self - dual khler metric does not contain cross - terms , i.e. @xmath45 .    one can consider a ortho - toric weakly - self dual khler metric , i.e. a weakly self - dual khler metric for which the two killing vector fields ( whose moment maps are @xmath59 and @xmath64 ) are independent and commuting . from the fact that they are ortho - toric , they should take the form and the weak self - duality condition should pick out specific forms for @xmath66 and @xmath67 . it turns out that for the following choices of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath68 where @xmath69 are constants , the ortho - toric metric is weakly self - dual @xcite .",
    "the two cases of interest to us are when we have a quadratic polynomial for which the weakly self - dual metric is just flat space and when we have a cubic polynomial for which the weakly self - dual metric is a khler einstein space .",

    "therefore we see that these coordinates will be useful in the description of several known , important examples .",
    "in this section , we will first gather various facts about the c - metric co - ordinates @xmath70 , which will be relevant for the discussion on and comparison with the flat space metric in darboux co - ordinates in the later subsection .",

    "a compelling reason to consider flat space in these darboux co - ordinates is that we can simply deform the metric and the complex structure while keeping the khler form fixed to arrive at the base - space of @xmath1 , as we will show in the next section .",

    "co - ordinates , the acg - cubic metric takes a certain form which we wo nt reproduce here . but more importantly",

    "we will not go into the details of how we obtained from the acg data .",
    "for the complete theory of symplectic potentials for the acg metrics and every other consideration in this appendix , we refer the reader to @xcite . from the work of guillemin @xcite",
    ", it is known that the above symplectic potential encodes in it the co - ordinate singularities of a toric manifold whose moment polytope is the convex set enclosed within the lines , @xmath182 in the @xmath183 plane , @xmath184 is a line with slope @xmath185 and @xmath31-intercept equalling @xmath186 .",
    "the intersection of the lines are : @xmath187 we thus have that the moment polytope of the acg - cubic metric is a triangle with vertices and edges .    at this stage , we have used up all the local properties of the fubini - study metric , namely khler - einstein and constant holomorphic sectional curvature , and we still have three undetermined constants in the acg - cubic metric viz . @xmath188 .",
    "the fubini - study metric has no free parameters apart from the ricci - scalar ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "we will have to use the global features of the fubini - study metric and @xmath173 to fix the parameters @xmath185 .",
    "global considerations specify the size and shape of the triangle which in turn fixed the @xmath185 s . before we do this",
    ", we give the co - ordinate transformation between the darboux co - ordinates and the polar co - ordinates : @xmath190 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the inverse , @xmath191 to get the above , one first goes from symplectic co - ordinates to complex co - ordinates by a legendre transform @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the legendre transform also provides the khler potential .",
    "then one matches with and .",
    "it is clear , especially from , that the parameters @xmath185 appear only in the co - ordinate transformation , and hence do not carry any local co - ordinate invariant information . * global considerations",
    ": * now , we can fix the parameters @xmath185 by the following two facts that carry global information of the fubini - study metric and @xmath173 .    *",
    "the moment polytope of @xmath173 is a right - angled isosceles triangle .",
    "* the volume of @xmath173 is fixed once one specifies the ricci - scalar . for , it is @xmath192    the easiest way of seeing * ( i ) * is to note that in the glsm description of @xmath173 , there is one d - term constraint , @xmath193 , which is solved by @xmath194 .",
    "let us choose the right angle to be at the intersection of @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "we then have the following ( two independent ) constraints : @xmath197 this allows us to fix two of the parameters in terms of one free parameter , say @xmath198 : @xmath199 now we will impose the volume constraint . in the symplectic co - ordinates , by virtue of the fact that the four - metric is of a block - diagonal form with two @xmath200 matrices which are inverses of each other , the determinant of the metric is just @xmath201 .",
    "hence , the volume of the manifold is just the product of the euclidean volumes of the moment polytope and the angular torus . from and from , we can compute the euclidean volume of the moment polytope in terms of @xmath198 . to compute the volume of the angular torus",
    ", we need the co - ordinate transformation . using the ranges of the angles @xmath202 and the second two equations in",
    ", we can compute the euclidean volume of the angular torus . putting everything together",
    ", we have @xmath203 now , requiring @xmath204 , we get a quadratic equation for @xmath198 with two roots @xmath205 .",
    "the two roots suggest that we have two different ways of realizing the fubini - study metric as an ortho - toric acg metric .",
    "one of the solutions , @xmath206 gives us co - ordinate singularities which are `` ring - like . ''",
    "using , we then have , @xmath207 so that the polynomials occuring in the acg - cubic metric are @xmath208 the explicit co - ordinate transformation is now much simpler : @xmath209    in this appendix , we have been able to show the explicit isometry between the fubini - study metric and a compact acg - cubic metric by deriving an explicit co - ordinate transformation between the polar co - ordinates of the form and the `` ring - like '' co - ordinates of the latter .",
    "a similar co - ordinate transformation relates the bergmann metric to the acg - cubic metric ; the co - efficient of the cubic has the opposite sign reflecting the sign of the scalar curvature .",
    "however , one free parameter remains as bergmann space is non - compact .",
    "* the gutowski - reall black hole khler metric and weak self - duality : * in the recent past , many researchers have constructed various supersymmetric @xmath1 black holes @xcite , but we will only need to consider the first ones and the simplest of them , the gutowski - reall black hole . the khler metric of the gutowski - reall black holes @xcite is @xmath210 where @xmath211 is @xmath212 with @xmath213 is a constant and @xmath214 are the right - invariant one - forms on @xmath215 , which can be expressed in terms of the euler angles @xmath216 as @xmath217 this metric is khler with the khler form @xmath218 in the orientation with @xmath219 , the khler form is self - dual .",
    "we can check for the weak - self - duality property of a given khler metric in atleast two ways @xcite .    *",
    "( i ) * the defining property of a weakly self - dual khler metric is that the anti - self - dual weyl tensor is harmonic , i.e. @xmath220 where @xmath221 acts on @xmath222 as on a two - form with values in anti - self - dual two - forms . on the other hand , the weyl tensor on a riemannian four - manifold is linked with the cotton - york tensor , @xmath223 .",
    "hence , vanishing of the anti - self - dual cotton - york tensor implies the weak self - duality of a given khler metric ( see definition 2 in @xcite . )    the cotton - york tensor is defined in @xcite , @xmath224 , where @xmath225 is the normalized ricci tensor given by @xmath226 define it s components by @xmath227 and we get @xmath228 the indices @xmath229 are anti - symmetric and one is supposed to think of the cotton - york tensor as a co - vector-(the index @xmath27)-valued two - form , @xmath230 . plugging in into , we get @xmath231 computing the anti - self - dual parts of the above two - forms gives us",
    ", @xmath232 we thus find that the anti - self - dual part of the cotton - york tensor is non - vanishing for the black hole khler metric , thus making it _ not _ weakly self - dual .",
    "note that for @xmath233 , the khler metric is weakly self - dual , which is as it should be because it corresponds to the bergmann khler metric .    *",
    "( ii ) * on a complex two - dimensional khler manifold @xmath234 with orientation chosen so that the khler form , @xmath235 , is self - dual , a property of the traceless ricci form , @xmath60 , is that it is anti - self - dual .",
    "any anti - self - dual two - form can always be written as a functional multiple of an anti - self - dual khler form of some other ( need nt be integrable ) almost - complex structure , @xmath236 , where @xmath237 is an almost - hermitian structure .",
    "one of the many defining properties of a weakly self - dual khler metric is that @xmath238 is khler ( see lemma 2 and lemma 4 of @xcite . )    for the khler metric , the traceless ricci form is @xmath239 where @xmath240 is @xmath241 this @xmath60 can be written as @xmath242 with @xmath243 and @xmath244 it is easy to see that @xmath245 is anti - self - dual and one can construct the almost complex structure @xmath246 and verify @xmath247 . for the khler metric to be weakly self - dual , @xmath248 which amounts to the following fourth order non - linear o.d.e : @xmath249 but , the black hole khler metric does _ not _ satisfy the above o.d.e , hence _ not _ weakly self - dual .",
