    "fig : mvsr ] shows that none of the current set of available eos allow for a @xmath42-@xmath16 neutron star while at the same time being consistent with the current mass - radius constraints from observations .",
    "the crux is that the eos needs to be sufficiently stiff to support @xmath42-@xmath16 neutron stars _ and _ at the same time sufficiently soft to make neutron stars with moderate radii in the canonical mass range .",
    "this balance appears to be difficult to realize .",
    "the stiff set of rmf eos produce systematically too large neutron stars .",
    "the soft compressible liquid - droplet ls180 eos @xcite agrees well with the mass - radius constraints , but is ruled out by its failure to support a @xmath42-@xmath16 neutron star .",
    "closest to satisfying all constraints are the ls220 eos of @xcite and the yet unpublished hsdd2 eos of @xcite based on the rmf model of @xcite .",
    "the stiffness of the nuclear eos at high and intermediate densities has important consequences for the postbounce evolution of core - collapse supernovae . in simple terms : the stiffer the eos , the more extended the protoneutron star and the larger the radius and the lower the matter temperature at which neutrinos decouple from the protoneutron star matter . assuming a fermi - dirac spectrum with zero degeneracy , the mean - squared energy of the emitted neutrinos is approximately given by @xmath50 @xcite , where @xmath51 is the matter temperature ( in units of mev ) at the neutrinosphere ( where the optical depth @xmath52 ) .",
    "hence , a softer eos will lead to systematically harder neutrino spectra than a stiffer eos ( as born out by the simulations of @xcite ) .",
    "since the charged - current neutrino heating rate @xmath53 scales @xmath54 , a soft eos leads to a higher neutrino heating efficiency than a stiff eos .",
    "this is at least part of the explanation why some published 2d simulations using the soft , now ruled - out ls180 eos have shown neutrino - driven explosions @xcite while simulations with stiffer eos have generally failed to yield such explosions in stars more massive than @xmath3@xmath55 @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "neutrinos and antineutrinos of all three flavors are produced in core - collapse supernovae and can oscillate from one flavor to another .",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath57 are made and interact via charged - current and neutral - current interactions , while @xmath58 and @xmath59 and their antineutrinos experience only neutral - current processes , since no muons or tauons are present in the core - collapse supernova environment .",

    ".2 cm    the oscillations between @xmath56 and @xmath62 or @xmath57 and @xmath63 are driven by their mass differences , forward scattering off background electrons , and forward scattering off other neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "these limiting regimes are called neutrino oscillations in vacuum  @xcite , matter - enhanced oscillations through the msw effect  @xcite , and collective oscillations  @xcite , respectively .",
    "quantitatively , the nature of neutrino flavor conversions depends on an interplay of vacuum neutrino oscillation frequency @xmath64 with the matter potential @xmath65 due to background electrons ( where @xmath66 is the electron number density ) and with the collective neutrino potential @xmath67 generated by the neutrinos themselves ( where @xmath68 is the neutrino and antineutrino number density ) . in a typical core - collapse supernova environment",
    ", the matter potential falls off with radius as @xmath69 , whereas the collective potential falls off faster with @xmath70 .",
    "so , when the neutrinos travel outward from the core , they generally first experience collective effects and then matter effects , which may be modified by shock wave effects  @xcite .",
    "after they leave the star , the mass eigenstates travel independently and are detected on earth as an incoherent superposition .",
    "there can be distinctive effects due to additional conversions during propagation inside the earth  ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the neutrino density creates a potential that is not flavor diagonal @xcite ; @xmath71 are density matrices in flavor space and depend on the flavor composition of the entire neutrino ensemble !",
    "flavor evolution of such dense neutrino gases  @xcite can be understood to good accuracy without considering many - particle effects  @xcite .",
    "calculations in spherical symmetry showed that the collective oscillations can affect neutrino flavor conversions substantially  @xcite .",
    "the main features observed were large flavor conversions for inverted hierarchy ( neutrinos masses @xmath72 ) , and a surprisingly weak dependence on the mixing angle and the matter density .    these features can be understood analytically . a dense gas of neutrinos displays collective flavor conversion  @xcite , i.e. , the flavor oscillations of all neutrinos and antineutrinos become coupled to each other and all of them undergo flavor conversion together .",
    "neutrinos of all energies oscillate almost in phase , through synchronized  @xcite / parametrically resonant  @xcite / bipolar oscillations  @xcite .",
    "the effect of the bipolar oscillations with a decreasing collective potential @xmath73 is a partial or complete swap of the energy spectra of two neutrino flavors  @xcite .",
    "the `` @xmath74 '' structure of weak interactions can give rise to a dependence of flavor evolution on the neutrino emission angle  @xcite or even flavor decoherence , i.e. , neutrinos acquire uncorrelated phases , and the neutrino fluxes for all flavors become almost identical  @xcite .",
    "for a realistic excess of @xmath56 , compared to @xmath57 fluxes , such angle - dependent effects are likely to be small  @xcite .",
    "even non - spherical source geometries can often be captured by an effective single - angle approximation  @xcite in the coherent regime .",
    "while most of these results were obtained for neutrino oscillations between two flavors , it was shown that with three flavors one can usually treat the oscillation problem by factorizing it into simpler two - flavor oscillation problems , since the mass - squared differences between the mass eigenstates obey latexmath:[$\\delta m_{12}^2 \\ll    @xcite , and the previous results are easily generalized .",
    "effects of potential cp violation are expected to be small with realistic differences between @xmath73 and @xmath76 neutrino fluxes  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "similar realistic departures are sufficient to trigger collective effects even for a vanishing mixing angle  @xcite .",
    "although the inherent nonlinearity and the presence of multi - angle effects make the analysis rather complicated , the final outcome for the neutrino fluxes turns out to be rather straightforward , at least in the spherically symmetric scenario . synchronized oscillations with a frequency @xmath77 take place just outside the neutrinosphere at @xmath78 km .",
    "these cause no significant flavor conversions since the mixing angle , which determines the extent of flavor conversion , is highly suppressed by the large matter potential due to the high electron density in these inner regions @xcite .",
    "a known exception occurs for the @xmath56 burst phase in low - mass progenitor stars that have a very steep density profile  @xcite . in such a situation ,",
    "neutrinos of all energies undergo msw resonances _ before _ collective effects become negligible  @xcite . at larger radii , @xmath79 km , bipolar or pendular oscillations @xmath80 with a higher frequency @xmath81 follow .",
    "these oscillations are instability - driven and thus depend logarithmically  @xcite on the mixing angle , occurring where the fluxes for the two flavors are very similar  @xcite . as @xmath73 decreases , so that @xmath82 , neutrinos near this instability may relax to the lower neutrino mass ( energy ) state .",
    "as a result , one finds one or more spectral swaps demarcated by sharp discontinuities or `` spectral splits '' in the oscillated flux .",
    "these simple explanations do not take into account the fact that neutrinos are emitted at different angles from the neutrinosphere . as a result ,",
    "radial neutrinos take a shorter path ( while tangentially emitted neutrinos take a longer path ) , and thus experience less ( more ) background potentials from the electrons and from other neutrinos leading to an emission angle - dependent flavor evolution .",
    "these sort of effects are called _ multi - angle effects _ , and can suppress or delay flavor conversions either through multi - angle matter effects  @xcite , or through multi - angle neutrino - neutrino interactions themselves  @xcite .      the observations outlined in the previous section [ sec : toy ] were mostly based on toy models of core - collapse supernova neutrino fluxes and background densities . recently ,",
    "several groups have tried to perform semi - realistic calculations of the oscillation physics , by injecting the output neutrino fluxes from supernova simulations into oscillation calculations  @xcite .",
    "interesting results have also been obtained by performing a linear stability analysis of the equations used for calculating the flavor conversion , with the initial conditions taken from simulations  @xcite .",
    "the simple picture given in  [ sec : toy ] has therefore undergone further changes .",
    "firstly , it has been recognized that matter effects suppress collective oscillations even in the bipolar regime through multi - angle effects as explained before  @xcite ( see also  [ sec : heating ] ) .",
    "this is most effective in the pre - explosion accretion phase , when the matter density is large in the region behind the stalled shock . in this case",
    ", it appears that one can simply ignore collective effects and only include the msw effects which take place at larger radii .",
    "of course , the result depends on details of the matter density and ratios of neutrino fluxes . in particular , for fluxes that are",
    "either highly symmetric in neutrinos and antineutrinos  @xcite , or include flavor dependent angular emission that leads to an angular instability  @xcite , one finds the matter suppression to be less effective .",
    "secondly , in the cooling phase of the explosion , @xmath62/@xmath63 fluxes may be larger than @xmath56/@xmath57 fluxes .",
    "this can lead to additional instabilities which cause multiple spectral splits  @xcite .",
    "these features survive multi - angle effects in general , and with the inclusion of three - flavor effects can lead to a rich and complex phenomenology  @xcite .",

    "the situation after the onset of explosion , however , may be quite different : the explosion rarefies the region behind the expanding shock and shuts off the large @xmath56/@xmath57 accretion luminosity , changing the neutrino flux asymmetry . extending our previous results to the explosion phase , we have repeated our simulations for the @xmath15-@xmath16 progenitor , but included an additional neutrino heating term in order to drive an early explosion .",

    "in this contribution to the proceedings of the hamburg neutrinos from supernova explosions ( ha@xmath26se ) 2011 conference , we have summarized the recent rapid progress in various aspects of core - collapse supernova theory . while 2d simulations continue to be perfected @xcite , self - consistent 3d simulations with energy - dependent neutrino radiation hydrodynamics are now the frontier of core - collapse supernova modeling @xcite and",
    "are made possible by the first generation of petascale supercomputers .",
    "general relativity is also beginning to be included in 2d @xcite and 3d simulations @xcite , which will eventually allow for first - principles studies of multi - d black hole formation and the relationship between massive star collapse and long gamma - ray bursts . also , open - source codes and microphysics inputs ( eos , neutrino opacities ) are gaining traction @xcite .",
    "they allow for code verification and physics benchmarking and are lowering the technological hurdle for new groups with new ideas trying to enter core - collapse supernova modeling .",
    "after ten years with little activity , improved modeling capabilities , faster computers , and the discovery of the @xmath42-@xmath16 neutron star , have spawned a flurry of activity in the nuclear eos community , which has already resulted in multiple new finite - temperature eos for core - collapse supernova modeling  @xcite .",
    "the realization that collective neutrino oscillations may occur in the core - collapse supernova environment @xcite has led to a plethora of work since @xmath32005 . as we have outlined in this article , the current state of affairs is that collective oscilations are unlikely to be dynamically relevant in driving the explosion , but their effects are crucial in predicting and understanding the neutrino signal that will be seen in detectors from the next nearby core collapse event .",
    "the current frontier of oscillation calculations in the core - collapse supernova context is marked by detailed multi - energy multi - angle calculations that take their input spectra and angular distributions from core - collapse supernova models .",
    "significant progress towards this has recently been made @xcite , but more will be needed to assess the potentially strong impact of neutrino - matter interactions and only partially - decoupled neutrino radiation fields in the oscillation regime",
    ".    the broad range of current and near - future advances in theory will be matched and tested by observations of the next galactic ( or magellanic - cloud ) core - collapse supernova .",
    "this event will most likely be observed in electromagnetic waves , neutrinos , and , with the upcoming advanced generation of gravitational - wave observatories , for the first time also in gravitational waves .",
    "gravitational waves carry dynamical information on the intricate multi - d processes occuring in the supernova core @xcite and will complement the structural and thermodynamic information carried by neutrinos .",
    "together , neutrinos and gravitational waves may finally shed observational light on the details of the core - collapse supernova mechanism .",
