    "the bulk of the mass lost by stars of initial mass @xmath5 @xmath6 is shed while such stars are on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "evidence is fast accumulating that , during late agb or post - agb evolutionary stages , the mass loss geometry of such stars changes from more or less spherically symmetric to axially symmetric , with the result that the vast majority of planetary nebulae ( pns )  the endpoints of post - main sequence stellar evolution for intermediate - mass stars  exhibit axisymmetric structures , ranging from elliptical to bipolar ( see , e.g. , reviews compiled by kastner , soker , & rappaport 2000 ) .",
    "planetaries in the latter structural category are very likely to possess molecular envelopes ( presumably the remnants of the ejected agb envelope ) that are readily detectable in the near - infrared rovibrational lines of h@xmath0 ( kastner et al .",
    "the available data suggest , furthermore , that the onset of near - infrared h@xmath0 emission in pns can be traced back to the pre - planetary nebula ( ppn ) phase but _ not _ back to the agb phase of evolution ( weintraub et al.1998 ) .",
    "these observations suggest that further studies of h@xmath0 emission from ppns and pns may offer insight into the transition from agb star to pn and from spherical to axisymmetric mass loss .",
    "the egg nebula ( rafgl 2688 ; ney et al .",
    "1975 ) is perhaps the best - known example of such a transition object .",

    "( hst ) optical and near - infrared images of the egg reveal a striking juxtaposition of circularly and axially symmetric structures ( sahai et al.1998a , b ) .",
    "this puzzling combination of structures has been detected in hst images of several other ppns and pns ( see , e.g. , reviews compiled by kastner , soker , & rappaport 2000 )",
    ". an outstanding feature of rafgl 2688 , however , is the `` quadrapolar '' morphology of 2.122 @xmath7 m h@xmath0 emission detected in near - infrared images ( gatley et al.1988 ) ; this structure is seen most clearly in an hst / nicmos image ( fig.[fig:2688nicmos ] ; sahai et al .",
    "this image shows that the linear extents and bow - shock - like structures of the polar and equatorial plane h@xmath0 emission regions are very similar , suggesting a common origin .",
    "furthermore , the sharp , limb - brightened boundaries of the h@xmath0 emission in all four `` lobes '' is suggestive of a fairly sudden event in the object s recent past .",
    "the kinematics of molecular emission from rafgl 2688 have been the subject of numerous investigations .",
    "bieging & nguyen - q - rieu ( 1988 , 1996 ) and cox et al .  ( 2000 ) mapped the velocity distribution of rotational emission of various species with radio interferometers , and cox et al .",

    "radio interferometric observations of hcn by bieging & nguyen - q - rieu yielded the rather surprising result of velocity gradients both along _ and perpendicular to _ the polar axis of the system , a result confirmed by cox et al .",
    "these gradients , which are of similar magnitude , were interpreted by bieging & nguyen - q - rieu ( 1988 , 1996 ) as arising out of a combination of spherical expansion and rotation about the polar axis .",
    "cox et al .  ( 1997 , 2000 ) and lucas et al .  ( 2000 ) , however , intepret the h@xmath0 kinematics of rafgl 2688 in terms of a system of multiple jets .    the evolved bipolar nebula rafgl 618 ( westbrook et al .  1975 )",
    "might be considered the direct evolutionary descendent of rafgl 2688 in many respects . both objects display molecule - rich circumstellar envelopes , carbon - rich circumstellar chemistries , and dusty , bipolar reflection nebulosities . whereas rafgl 2688 harbors an f - type central star and is not known to contain an h ii region , rafgl 618 possesses a b - type central star and compact h ii region , suggesting that the latter nebula has evolved farther toward the pn stage . like the egg nebula , rafgl 618 displays bright near - infrared h@xmath0 emission , but in the case of rafgl 618 the h@xmath0 emission appears to be confined to a region along its polar axis ( latter et al.1995 ) .    while the `` quadrapolar '' structure of the h@xmath0 emission in the egg appears to be unique",
    ", it may be a short - lived evolutionary phase common to many or most agb stars as they go through the transition to ppns . in rafgl 618",
    ", however , the h@xmath0 morphology also is unusual as emission is found only along the polar axes , whereas most ppn in which h@xmath0 is detected exhibit the strongest h@xmath0 along the equatorial plane ( kastner et al .",
    "thus , the kinematics and morphology of h@xmath0 emission from these two objects are strongly deserving of more careful study .",
    "to investigate the h@xmath0 velocity gradients of rafgl 2688 in detail , we obtained a series of high - resolution , long - slit spectra in the 2.12 @xmath7 m region with the noao phoenix near - infrared spectrometer ( hinkle et al .",
    "we also obtained a phoenix spectrum of 2.12 @xmath7 m h@xmath0 emission from rafgl 618 . as we now describe , examination and comparison of the h@xmath0 kinematics of these two objects , as revealed in the phoenix spectroscopic data , offer clues to their detailed structures and recent evolutionary histories .",
    "data presented here were obtained with phoenix on the 2.1 m telescope at kitt peak , az , in 1997 june ( rafgl 2688 ) and 1997 december ( rafgl 618 ) .",
    "phoenix illuminates a @xmath8 section of an aladdin insb detector array .",
    "the spectrograph slit was @xmath9 oriented approximately east - west .",

    "this resolution is comparable to that of the mm - wave molecular line interferometry ( e.g. , bieging & nguyen - q - rieu 1996 ) , and represents an order of magnitude improvement over previous imaging spectroscopy of h@xmath0 emission from rafgl 2688 ( cox et al .",

    "integration times for both sources were 1200 sec per position .",
    "spectral images were reduced and wavelength calibrated as described by weintraub et al .",
    "bad pixels were removed by calculating the running mean for @xmath16 groups of pixels and replacing outliers in each pixel group with the running mean . for the rafgl",
    "2688 data , the reduced spectral images were stacked in declination according to the commanded telescope offsets , to produce a ( ra , dec , velocity ) data cube of h@xmath0 emission .",
    "calibrated spectral images of rafgl 2688 are presented in fig.[fig:2688posvel ] .",
    "all four distinct h@xmath0 emitting regions ( hereafter referred to as the n , e , s , and w lobes ) seen in the nicmos image ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2688nicmos ] ) are clearly detected in these spectral images ( see , e.g. , the dec = @xmath171  panel ) .",
    "in addition , the large velocity gradients of molecular emission in rafgl 2688 are readily apparent in the phoenix data . the s lobe h@xmath0 emission ( top 4 panels of fig.[fig:2688posvel ] ) is predominantly redshifted with respect to the systemic velocity of rafgl 2688 ( @xmath18 ) , with velocities ranging from @xmath19 km s@xmath2 to @xmath20 km s@xmath2 relative to @xmath18 .",
    "the n lobe emission ( bottom 4 panels ) appears almost as a `` mirror image '' of the s lobe in terms of its velocity pattern , with emission predominantly at blueshifted velocities ranging from @xmath21 km s@xmath2 to @xmath22 km s@xmath2 relative to @xmath18 .",
    "the velocity domains of the n and s lobes are well illustrated in representative spectra extracted from the images obtained at declination offsets of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2688spectra]a ) .    as expected from the known position angle ( pa ) of the polar axis of the system , pa @xmath25 ( weintraub et al .",
    "2000 ) , the e lobe is detected between declination offsets of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , whereas the w lobe emission is detected between offsets of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the position - velocity images obtained at these positions dramatically demonstrate the e - w velocity gradient previously detected in molecular emission line studies of rafgl 2688 , as do representative spectra extracted from the e and w lobe emission regions in the spectral image obtained at @xmath30 declination offset ( fig . [",
    "fig:2688spectra]b ) .",
    "that is , the e lobe is primarily blueshifted , whereas the w lobe is primarily redshifted . as we discuss in more detail below , however , the e - w and n - s velocity gradients differ in detail . in addition , the spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig:2688spectra ] illustrate that the h@xmath0 line profiles of the e and w lobes are generally narrower than those of the n and s lobes .    the phoenix spectral images also reveal velocity structure _ within _ the n , s , and e lobes .",
    "in particular , the brightest emission from the s lobe is seen to migrate from lower to higher redshifted velocities moving inward ( northward ) from its tip at @xmath31 in dec to @xmath28 in dec .",
    "the n lobe exhibits precisely complementary behavior , with its brightest emission migrating from lower to higher blueshifted velocities moving inward ( southward ) from @xmath32 in dec to @xmath27 in dec .",
    "the e lobe also shifts in central velocity with declination offset , migrating from larger to smaller blueshifted velocities moving from south to north ( i.e. , from @xmath26 to @xmath27 in declination offset ) .",
    "in contrast , the velocity centroid of the w lobe does not shift noticeably with declination offset .      in fig .",
    "[ fig:2688cube ] we display selected velocity planes from the h@xmath0 data cube constructed for rafgl 2688 .",
    "the four principal `` lobes '' of h@xmath0 emission are apparent again , with one pair oriented parallel ( roughly n - s ) and one perpendicular ( roughly e - w ) to the polar axis .",
    "the velocity gradients in the n - s and e - w h@xmath0 lobe pairs are plainly evident in these images , with the n and e lobes blueshifted by up to @xmath33 km s@xmath2 and the s and w lobes similarly redshifted .",
    "as previously mentioned , however , the n - s and e - w h@xmath0 lobe pairs differ in their detailed kinematic signatures , as we now further describe .    the polar h@xmath0 lobes of rafgl 2688 each display velocity gradients along the polar axis .",
    "this velocity gradient is apparent in the velocity - resolved images of rafgl 2688 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2688cube ] ) . at the most extreme blueshifted and redshifted velocity intervals ,",
    "respectively , only those portions of the n and s lobes nearest the inferred position of the central star are apparent , whereas the outer regions ( tips ) of the lobes appear brightest at more moderate radial velocities .",
    "this trend is made more quantitative in a plot of the velocity centroid of h@xmath0 emission as a function of position along the polar axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2688poles ] ) . to construct this plot , we extracted spectra at each declination offset ( see caption of fig .",
    "[ fig:2688spectra ] ) .",
    "we then fit a gaussian function to the h@xmath0 line profile in each spectrum , to obtain the line velocity centroid .",
    "the resulting trend in the velocity centroids ( fig.[fig:2688poles ] ) is easily anticipated based on the position - velocity images themselves ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2688posvel ] ) ; i.e. , relatively low velocity emission ( @xmath34 km s@xmath2 ) is seen at the tips of the lobes , while the highest velocity emission in each lobe ( @xmath35 km s@xmath2 ) is found nearest the position of the central star .",
    "this trend is remarkably similar to that observed in the position - velocity image of rafgl 618 (  3.2 ) .",
    "in contrast , images extracted from the data cube ( fig .  [ fig:2688cube ] ) demonstrate that the e lobe displays a gradient from north to south , _ perpendicular _ to the line joining it to the central star s position .",
    "specifically , note that in the image centered at @xmath36 km s@xmath2 , only the southernmost tip of the e lobe appears , whereas in the image centered at @xmath37 km s@xmath2 , the entire e lobe is present .",
    "hence , the phoenix data appear to resolve kinematically the distinct emission components of the e lobe that are resolved spatially in the nicmos h@xmath0 image of rafgl 2688 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the w lobe , meanwhile , does not reveal similar velocity structure , a result qualitatively consistent with its more localized appearance in the nicmos image .      the phoenix spectral image obtained for rafgl 618",
    "is displayed in fig.[fig:618posvel ] .",
    "bright h@xmath0 emission is detected along the entire polar axis of rafgl 618 .",
    "spectra extracted from this image ( fig.[fig:618spectra ] ) demonstrate that very high velocity h@xmath0 emission ( up to @xmath38 km s@xmath2 in each lobe ) is present in this bipolar outflow .",
    "similarly broad line wings have been detected previously in millimeter- and submillimeter - wave molecular spectra of rafgl 618 ( e.g. , gammie et al .",
    "1989 ; neri et al .  1992 ; meixner et al.1998 ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 spectra demonstrate unequivocally that  as is the case for rafgl 2688  the highest velocity molecular material is found closest to the central star of rafgl 618 .",
    "a similar result was inferred for rafgl 618 by gammie et al .",
    ", based on the relative strengths of line wing emission in single - dish co ( 2 - 1 ) and co ( 3 - 2 ) spectra .",
    "we now construct a detailed , empirical model of the h@xmath0 kinematics of rafgl 2688 . in formulating this model ,",
    "we are guided by our observations that ( 1 ) the polar lobes are characterized by velocity gradients in which the fastest moving material is found closest to the star , and the slowest moving material is found at the tips of the h@xmath0 emission regions ; and ( 2 ) the h@xmath0 emission seen projected along the equatorial plane contains a substantial velocity gradient east to west and a second , smaller velocity gradient in the e lobe that runs north to south .",
    "the gaussian shapes of the spatially integrated h@xmath0 emission line profiles of the polar lobes of rafgl 2688 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2688spectra]a ) are similar to the molecular emission line profiles detected in the radio regime from species such as co and hcn ( e.g. , bieging & nguyen - q - rieu 1996 ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 line profiles can be understood in the context of the detailed morphology of h@xmath0 emission seen in the nicmos image ( fig.[fig:2688nicmos ] ) . in this image the n and",
    "s lobes appear as limb - brightened cavities .",
    "the emission peaks of the line profiles correspond to the brightest regions of the lobes  their limbs ( i.e. , outlines )  whereas the line wings are produced by emission from within the fainter lobe interiors , which is dominated by material in the near sides ( blue wings ) and far sides ( red wings ) of the lobes .",
    "the peak of the line profile therefore indicates the line of sight component of the h@xmath0 velocity at the lobe limb , and we can infer the deprojected n and s lobe h@xmath0 velocities as a function of position given an estimate of @xmath39 , the inclination of the polar axis of the system out of the plane of the sky .",
    "previous results ( yusef - zadeh et al .  1984 ; sahai et al .",
    "1998a ) suggest @xmath40 .",
    "the velocities we measure at the tips of the lobes ( @xmath41 km s@xmath2 ; fig .",
    "[ fig:2688poles ] ) then suggest that the gas in this region is expanding away from the central star at a velocity @xmath42 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we further infer that the h@xmath0 velocities in the regions of the lobes within @xmath43 of the inferred position of the central star rise to @xmath44 km s@xmath2 .    for simplicity",
    ", we assume this behavior can be described by an inverse power law of the form @xmath45 for ( ra , dec ) offsets ( @xmath46 ) that lie within @xmath47 of the projected polar axis of rafgl 2688 , where @xmath48 is the velocity at the tips of the polar lobes , @xmath49 is the observed radial velocity at projected angular radius @xmath50 from the central star , and @xmath39 is the inclination of the polar axis out of the plane of the sky .",
    "based on the foregoing discussion of line profiles , we make the further simplification that the polar h@xmath0 emission is dominated by emission from the lobe limbs .      _",
    "if one postulates that all of the east - west h@xmath0 emission is confined to a narrow region along the equatorial plane , _ then a component of azimuthal velocity must be present in the material responsible for this emission .",
    "such a structure might be analogous to that of the equatorial `` skirt '' observed in @xmath51 car ( smith , gehrz , & krautter 1998 ) .",
    "although the kinematics of the two objects appear to differ in detail ( zethson et al .",
    "1999 ) , the h@xmath0 morphology in the nicmos image ( fig .",
    "1 ) is consistent with the confinement of the h@xmath0-emitting material in rafgl 2688 to the plane of the system : knot e2 is brighter than knot e4 , as expected if the former is directed toward the observer and the latter is directed away from the observer ; while e1 and e3 , which mark the perpendiculars to the polar axis ( see weintraub et al .  2000 , their fig .",
    "6 ) , are of similar intensity , as expected if we view these structures through similar columns of intervening material .",
    "we therefore assume that the equatorial plane h@xmath0 kinematics consist of a combination of azimuthal ( rotation ) and radial ( expansion ) velocity components .",
    "we calculate these velocities from the relation @xmath52 for ( ra , dec ) offsets ( @xmath46 ) that lie within @xmath47 of the projected equatorial plane of rafgl 2688 , where @xmath53 is the expansion velocity , @xmath54 is the rotational velocity about the polar axis , and @xmath55 is the azimuthal angle with respect to the polar axis of rafgl 2688 , given by @xmath56 offsets ( @xmath57 are then related to ( @xmath46 ) via a rotation of the coordinate system by the projected position angle of the polar axis on the plane of the sky .",
    "model parameters @xmath48 and @xmath58 are relatively well constrained by fig.[fig:2688poles ] , from which we infer @xmath59 km s@xmath2 and @xmath60 .",
    "it is more difficult to constrain the values of the parameters governing the equatorial plane h@xmath0 radial velocities , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "to do so , we compared model velocity field images ( @xmath49 ) calculated for a range of values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 with velocity centroids calculated from the phoenix data cube ( see , e.g. , bieging & rieu 1996 ) .",
    "we find qualitative and rough quantitative agreement between model and data for values of both @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the range @xmath4 km s@xmath2 , with the additional constraint @xmath61 km s@xmath2 .",
    "an example of the results for a representative successful model is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:2688vcomp ] . in this figure",
    "the model velocity centroid image is calculated from eqs .  1 and 2 for values of @xmath62 km s@xmath2 and @xmath63 km s@xmath2 .",
    "there is clear qualitative agreement between the model and observed velocity images for these parameter values , in the sense that the overall distribution of redshifted and blueshifted emission is captured by the model .",
    "furthermore , this model reproduces the important details of the observed h@xmath0 velocity distribution previously described .",
    "specifically , the model recovers the magnitudes and positions of the observed blueshifted velocity extrema near ( ra , dec ) offsets @xmath64 in the n lobe and @xmath65 in the e lobe , as well as the magnitudes and positions of redshifted velocity extrema near offsets @xmath66 in the s lobe and at @xmath67 in the w lobe .",
    "empirically , we find these parameter values  @xmath68 km s@xmath2 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 km s@xmath2 , and @xmath71 km s@xmath2  provide the best agreement between model and data in terms of overall qualitative appearance of the velocity images as well as in the location _ and _ magnitude of the velocity extrema . however , this model can not be considered a `` best fit '' to the data .",
    "rather , the foregoing comparison of calculated and observed velocity fields offers an indication of the magnitude of an azimuthal velocity component relative to the components of radial expansion both parallel and perpendicular to the polar axis .",
    "the kinematic model described in  4.1 is not unique .",
    "for example , on the basis of high spatial and spectral resolution co maps , which display kinematics very similar to those seen in h@xmath0 emission , cox et al .",
    "( 1997 , 2000 ) and lucas et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have proposed that the velocity gradients parallel and perpendicular to the polar axis result from a multipolar system of jets whose directions of motion are everywhere directed _ radially outward _ from the central star . since the entire fan - like eastern h@xmath0 emission region is blueshifted , the cox et al .",
    "model requires that these outflows must be directed well `` above '' the equatorial plane of the system , toward the observer , while the outflows responsible for the western h@xmath0 emission region are more tightly confined and directed `` below '' the equatorial plane , away from the observer .",
    "hence , in this model , the remarkable orthogonality of the h@xmath0 and co emission morphologies is purely a result of viewing angle .",
    "multiple symmetry axes are also suggested by observations of radio continuum emission ( jura et al .",
    "chaotic precession of bipolar jets might explain these observations ( see , e.g. , livio 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "the very similar linear extents of the orthogonal n - s and e - w molecular emission regions appear to pose a problem for any model invoking precessing jets , however .",
    "bieging & nguyen - q - rieu ( 1988 , 1996 ) have proposed a model in which the radio molecular line emission from the projected equatorial plane of rafgl 2688 originates in an expanding , rotating equatorial disk or torus .",
    "though qualitatively similar to the model proposed in  4.1 , our model does not require that the h@xmath0 emission arises from a disk .",
    "rather , the e - w h@xmath0 lobes , like the polar ( n - s ) h@xmath0 lobes ( see below ) , trace the interaction between material ejected along the equatorial plane at two different epochs ; indeed , the interferometric radio molecular line observations indicate that the molecular jets detected in co may be responsible for shocks that produce the h@xmath0 emission , based on the striking correspondence between the co and h@xmath0 emission morphologies ( lucas et al.2000 ) .",
    "there is no particular reason to assume that the previously ejected material forms a complete torus around the star and , indeed , cox et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and morris & sahai ( 2000 ) have argued , on the basis of radio and mid - infrared imaging , respectively , that no such structure exists .",
    "however , the optical and infrared morphology of the nebula  in particular , the apparent occultation of the southern h@xmath0 lobe and reflection nebulosity within @xmath72 of the central star  does suggest the presence of a large ( @xmath73 radius ) , optically thick structure .        as noted by sahai et al .",
    "( 1998a ) , the detailed morphology of near - ir h@xmath0 emission from rafgl 2688 strongly supports previous suggestions that the emission arises in shocks formed by the interaction of recently - developed , fast - moving winds with slower - moving material .",
    "this relatively slow - moving material likely was ejected during the agb phase of the progenitor star .",
    "assuming j shocks are the origin of the gas heating that leads to h@xmath0 emission then , according to model calculations ( e.g. , burton , hollenbach , & tielens 1992 ) , the shock fronts at the h@xmath0 lobe tips are moving at a minimum velocity @xmath74 km s@xmath2 in the frame of the preshocked ( agb ) wind .",
    "this limit corresponds roughly to the energy threshold for excitation of the @xmath14 @xmath13 h@xmath0 line .",
    "hence , if the velocities inferred for the tips of the polar lobes and for the equatorial region , @xmath75 km s@xmath2 and @xmath76 km s@xmath2 , respectively , consist of a superposition of ( minimum ) shock and agb wind velocities , we infer that the agb wind was ejected at @xmath77 km s@xmath2 , which is typical of _ low - mass _ carbon stars . on the other hand , the nascent bipolar structure and strong h@xmath0 emission of rafgl 2688 hint at a relatively massive progenitor ( kastner et al .",
    "1996 ) which may , in turn , suggest a larger agb outflow velocity ( @xmath78 km s@xmath2 ; e.g. , kastner et al .",
    "if so , it would appear that , at their leading edges , the shocks which excite h@xmath0 have imparted very little momentum to the former agb wind . in either case",
    "it is apparent that , well behind the leading edges of the shocks that excite the h@xmath0 in the polar lobes , considerable wind acceleration has taken place .",
    "the maximum speed for non - dissociative shocks is @xmath33 km s@xmath2 ( burton et al .",
    "thus , within @xmath43 ( @xmath79 au ) of the central star of rafgl 2688 , the outflow velocity of the gas is at least @xmath80 km s@xmath2 , which is much larger than the outflow velocities of agb stars . in rafgl 618 ,",
    "meanwhile , the inferred polar outflow velocities very near the central star are at least @xmath81 km s@xmath2 ( neglecting projection effects ) , assuming the shocks are traveling at @xmath33 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we conclude that the velocity gradients along the polar axes of both rafgl 2688 and rafgl 618 trace rapid transitions from the `` slow , '' spherically symmetric winds of their agb progenitors to faster , collimated , post - agb winds .",
    "a likely mechanism for such a transition is that late agb and post - agb ejecta relatively close to the central star are accelerated with increasing efficiency as the star is `` unveiled '' and circumstellar material is exposed to a progressively hotter photosphere and , potentially , a stronger stellar magnetic field .",
    "indeed , rafgl 2688 has been observed to be increasing steadily in optical magnitude ( gottlieb & liller 1976 ) .",
    "these conditions would appear to be conducive to the formation of h@xmath0 shocks during the post - agb but pre - planetary nebula phase of bipolar nebulae , a scenario consistent with the conclusions of weintraub et al .",
    "such shocks could then play a central role in the transition from spherically symmetric to axisymmetric outflow , as the `` young , '' fast ( but still predominantly molecular ) wind driven by the emerging post - agb star excavates bipolar cavities within the previously ejected red giant wind .",
    "the displacement from the central star to the tips of the h@xmath0 lobes ( @xmath82 au ) , combined with the deprojected velocities at the lobe tips , @xmath59 km s@xmath2 , suggests the h@xmath0 lobes have a dynamical age of @xmath83 yr , which then serves as an upper limit to the post - agb `` unveiling '' of the central star .      a presently popular theory accounts for the structure of bipolar planetary nebulae as due to the interaction of a close binary system , in which the secondary diverts mass loss from and/or spins up the envelope of the primary ( e.g. , soker 1997 , 1998 ) . according to a specific formulation of the binary progenitor model ( soker 1998 )",
    ", the relatively massive progenitors of bipolar pns undergo a phase during the agb evolution of the primary in which the secondary resides just outside the envelope of the primary and diverts mass loss into the equatorial plane .",
    "this phase is followed by a short - lived common envelope phase that , presumably , rapidly spins up the envelope of the primary ; the carbon star v hya , which displays @xmath84",
    "km s@xmath2 , may be undergoing such a phase at present ( barnbaum et al .",

    "many , though certainly not all , of the observed characteristics of rafgl 2688 appear to be explained by such a model .",
    "specifically , its notorious system of concentric broken arcs would result from episodic , spherically symmetric mass loss during a prolonged period of quasi - single star agb mass loss preceding the common envelope phase ; the subsequent formation of bipolar structure would be the result of the increasingly close proximity of a companion during the late agb evolution of the primary ; and the h@xmath0 shocks would mark the rapid termination of a common envelope phase and the resultant sudden ejection of the remaining agb star envelope . hence , the h@xmath0 emission regions are produced by bullet - like ejecta that have collided with material that was recently ejected  much of it along the equatorial plane  during the close binary phase preceding common envelope formation .",
    "it would appear that no existing model can explain satisfactorily the rich phenomenology of the egg nebula .",
    "the molecular kinematics of its equatorial region remain particularly problematic for present models , whether or not a component of azimuthal velocity is present along the equatorial plane of the system .",
    "a pure radial outflow model can not explain the striking orthogonality of the molecular emission from rafgl 2688 ; furthermore , such a model is , at present , reliant on _ ad hoc _ physical mechanisms for the presence of multiple symmetry axes ( e.g. , frank 2000 ) . on the other hand , the azimuthal velocities of the equatorial h@xmath0 emission suggested by our model and",
    "the models of bieging & nguyen - q - rieu ( 1988 , 1996 ) are far too large to be explained by keplerian rotation ; an alternative source of angular momentum is required . as proposed by bieging & nguyen - q - rieu , this angular momentum might be provided by magnetic fields that are corotating with the star .",
    "it is of considerable importance to establish whether sufficiently large fields can be generated via interaction with a close companion star ( bieging & nguyen - q - rieu 1988 , 1996 ) or by dynamo activity in the primary post - agb star itself ( e.g. , soker 2000 ; blackman , frank , & welch 2000 )",
    ". the latter mechanism could be particularly effective if the central star has just undergone a common envelope phase , such that highly magnetically active interior layers of the star drive the molecular jets seen in co and h@xmath0 .",
