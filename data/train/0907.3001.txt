    "the data set is reduced to 8.6 live hours due to the lack of suitable off - source data for the background estimation and there the flux upper limit was determined to f  ( @xmath0460  gev )  @xmath9  9.9  @xmath10  10@xmath14 ph .",

    "from the upper limits of the gamma - ray luminosity of the cluster abell  85 it is possible to estimate upper limits on the total energy in hadronic cosmic rays in this cluster . for this purpose a spectral index of the cosmic rays of -2.1 is adopted and it is further assumed that the spatial distribution of the cosmic rays follows the large scale distribution of the gas density excluding the central cooling core .",
    "these conditions seem to be realistic since no losses of hadronic cosmic rays at relevant energies occur in clusters and therefore the hard source spectrum of cosmic rays should be seen@xcite@xcite and since magneto - hydrodynamic instabilities disfavor very centrally peaked distributions of cosmic rays@xcite@xcite . with the adopted assumptions it is found that the total energy in cosmic rays is less than 8% of the thermal energy of the intra - cluster medium@xcite .",
    "this value is at the lower bounds of model predictions .",
    "similar results have very recently also been inferred from deep radio observations for the galaxy cluster abell  521@xcite .",
