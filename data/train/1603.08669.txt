    ", which have highest surface - to - volume ratio attract a lot of attention in the fundamental research as well as from the point of the possible technological applications  @xcite . for example , for graphene , the most promising ways to use its unique electronic structure ( linear dispersion , zero band gap , and zero density of states at the dirac point , @xmath2 ) are utilization in flexible touch screens  @xcite or gas sensors  @xcite . in the later work of schedin _",
    "_ it was shown that the @xmath3m - sized graphene - based field - effect transistor shows unprecedented gas sensitivity even at room temperature .",
    "this functionality is explained by the change of the resistivity of the graphene sheet upon adsorption or desorption of molecules , which behave as donors or acceptors .",
    "the low density of states ( dos ) in graphene around @xmath2 , which in the neutral state coincides with the fermi level ( @xmath4 ) , allows easily tune the graphene conductivity upon very small charge transfer .",
    "further , it was found that the sensitivity of such graphene - based gas sensors can be improved if dopants or defects are introduced in the graphene matrix  @xcite .",
    "further search for the two - dimensional materials with tuneable transport properties leads to the experiments on the semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides , with structural formula mx@xmath0 , where m is a metal atom ( mo or w ) and x is a chalcogen ( s or se ) .",
    "these materials have a layered structure , where separated layers are bonded by weak dispersive forces .",
    "each mx@xmath0-layer consists of a metal atoms sandwiched between inert layers of chalcogen atoms as shown in fig .",
    "[ dosandbands](a , b ) .",
    "covalent bonds localized between metal and chalcogen atoms lead to the semiconducting nature of these materials and to the inert nature of their surfaces at ambient conditions .",
    "however , it was shown that they are quite sensitive to the gaseous and higher temperature treatment .",
    "for example , mos@xmath0 can be oxidized in the presence of oxygen or / and water already at @xmath5c  @xcite .",
    "recent demonstration of the field - effect transistor ( fet ) functionality for thin layers of mos@xmath0 and other semiconducting tmds  @xcite brings the idea to use these materials in gas sensor devices . the mos@xmath0-based fet with a thickness of @xmath6 single layers used for detection of gases demonstrated high sensitivity for no gas with a detection limit down to @xmath7ppm  @xcite . here",
    "no molecules behave as acceptors attracting the electron density from the mos@xmath0 layer .",
    "theoretical analysis of these data confirms the main findings  @xcite . in the same work the adsorption of other gases",
    "was also considered within the lsda and gga approaches and it was found that h@xmath0 , o@xmath0 , h@xmath0o , no , and no@xmath0 adsorb weakly on mos@xmath0 and behave like acceptors , whereas nh@xmath8 is a charge donor .",
    "these theoretical findings were later supported by the recent transport and gas sensing experiments  @xcite .",
    "further developments in the filed of electronics and optoelectronics of tmds bring the w - based materials , like ws@xmath0 and wse@xmath0 , in the forefront of these studies  @xcite .",
    "they have several advantages compared to mos@xmath0 , since they have higher thermal stability as well as their electronic structure opens wide perspectives for applications in opto- and spin - electronics , and in the possible new field , the so - called valleytronics , where additional degree of freedom of the electron ( valley polarization ) might be used for the device operation .",
    "the gas sensing properties of ws@xmath0 were experimentally studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the influence of the gas adsorption ( nh@xmath8 and o@xmath0 ) on the photoelectrical properties of the transport devices was investigated at room temperature .",
    "similar to the gas adsorption on mos@xmath0 , it was found that molecules are physisorbed on the surface of ws@xmath0 with oxygen behaving as acceptor and ammonia leading to the @xmath9-doping of ws@xmath0 . with respect to the photoelectrical properties of ws@xmath0 , @xmath10- and @xmath9-doping of this material via molecules",
    "adsorption leads to reduction and to increase of photo - responsivity , respectively .",
    "density - functional theory ( dft ) analysis ( without inclusion of the spin - orbit interaction ) of the gas adsorption on ws@xmath0  @xcite shows that the underlying band structure of tmd material is not influenced significantly upon molecules deposition confirming the weak interaction at the interface . in this work",
    "it was also found that adsorption of o@xmath0 , no , and no@xmath0 on wse@xmath0 leads to the pinning of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital around the fermi level .",
    "it is interesting that no electronic structure studies by means of photoelectron spectroscopy ( of the core levels or valence band states ) of gas adsorption on tmds were published in the literature , motivating the present studies .",
    "here we present x - ray and angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps and arpes ) results obtained during adsorption of no@xmath0 on wse@xmath0(001 ) .",
    "small changes in the core - levels positions as well as in the valence band were found upon adsorption of gas molecules at room temperature and at @xmath11k indicating the physisorption nature of interaction at the gas - surface interface for tmd material . it is found that adsorption of no@xmath0 leads to the slight @xmath10-doping of wse@xmath0 as manifested by the rigid shift of core levels and valence band states of tmd to the smaller binding energies .",

    "however , as one can see from the presented dos and band structure of the no@xmath0/wse@xmath0 system ( fig .",
    "[ dosandbands](d ) ) there is no _ hybridization _ between valence band states of wse@xmath0-substrate and molecular orbitals of no@xmath0 .",

    "[ stm ] ) . in these calculations ,",
    "performed in the framework of the tersoff - hamann formalism  @xcite , the charge density integration was performed for the energy range of @xmath23ev below of the middle of the energy gap of wse@xmath0 . in this case the no@xmath0 homo state is included in the integration energy range for the no@xmath0/wse@xmath0 system .",
    "one can see that adsorption of no@xmath0 on the surface of the tmd material does not change the local density of states that can be taken as a signature of the absence of the orbital hybridization of the molecular orbitals and valence band states of wse@xmath0 .",
    "the behaviour of isolated no@xmath0 molecule on wse@xmath0 is similar to the one on the other tmd surfaces like mos@xmath0 or ws@xmath0 .",
    "indeed , in all cases the molecule - surface interaction is accounted for by weak dispersion forces , which do not drastically affect the electronic structure of adsorbent and result in relatively small adsorption energies : @xmath48mev , @xmath49mev  @xcite , and @xmath50mev@xcite for wse@xmath0 , ws@xmath0 and mos@xmath0 , respectively . the adsorption geometry where oxygens of no@xmath0 molecule are directed towards surface",
    "was found to be the most energetically favourable also for adsorption on the top of all these surfaces .",
    "however , the adsorption positions were found to be different : while for ws@xmath0 and mos@xmath0 the molecule tends to adsorb above center of the ring , in wse@xmath0 the site right above surface se atom was found to be the most favourable . it should be noted here , the deviation in adsorption energies at different sites in the latter case is just about few mev that is , in principle , at the limit of dft calculation precision .",
    "the important point is that in all cases no@xmath0 acts as electron acceptor that helps to change the conductivity of surface upon no@xmath0 adsorption in wide limits and opens up the potential opportunities to employ tmd materials as sensitive no@xmath0 gas detector . during adsorption the surface valence electron occupies the lumo of no@xmath0 which finally turns out to be located around fermi level of combined no@xmath0/tmd system .",
    "such effect of the localisation of the flat adsorbate - induced impurity state at the fermi level of tmd surface was early observed for a number of adsorbates like o@xmath0 , no , no@xmath0 on different tmd materials and was called fermi - level pinning phenomenon  @xcite . as was shown in latter work such effect",
    "may be explained within traditional charge transfer theory provided isolated molecular lumo is lower in energy than fermi level of pristine surface . that causes the drift of electron density from the surface to unoccupied well - localised molecular orbital without hybridisation or formation of a strong chemical bonding between adsorbate and adsorbent allowing only weak dispersion electrostatic attraction .     along the high - symmetry directions of the hexagonal brillouine zone ( shown as an inset ) extracted from the complete 3d data set for the arpes intensity .",

    "two data sets are presented , which were collected at room temperature and @xmath11k . ]    in order to proof the theoretical findings on the weak adsorption of no@xmath0 on wse@xmath0 we perform systematic xps and apres experiments for this system .",

    "adsorption of no@xmath0 on wse@xmath0(0001 ) surface leads to monotonic energy shift of the bands at the @xmath51 point as a function of the no@xmath0 and reaches the maximal value of @xmath59mev at @xmath52l of the no@xmath0 dose [ fig .",

    "( for every no@xmath0 dose the fermi level position was carefully calibrated via measurement of the pes spectra of the ta clamps allowing to trace the shift of the valence band states of wse@xmath0 . )",
    "here we would like to emphasise that the measured energy shift does not depend on the temperature of the wse@xmath0 substrate as can be seen from the presented dependencies of the energy positions of vb1 and vb2 bands as a function of the gas dose [ inset of fig .",
    "[ dosandbands](b ) ] . taking into account that energy shifts for the core - level lines and valence band states , measured by xps and arpes , respectively ,",

    "we can see that the studied surface of wse@xmath0 is extremely inert preventing further oxidation of the bulk of tmd material even at very high dose of the strong oxidation gas .",
    "this effect can be explained by the formation of the strong covalent - like bonds between w and se in the layer , leading to the charge accumulation inside the layer and preventing any strong interactions on the surface .",
