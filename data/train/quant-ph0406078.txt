    "recently , many efforts have been devoted to the entanglement in strongly correlated systems@xcite , in the hope that its non - trivial behavior in these systems may shed new lights on the understanding of physical phenomena of condensed matter physics .",
    "a typical case is the relation of entanglement to quantum phase transition@xcite .",
    "for example , osterloh _ el al.,_@xcite reported that the entanglement shows scaling behavior in the vicinity of quantum phase transition point of the transverse - field ising model .",
    "most of previous works are for spin 1/2 systems , where the degrees of freedom at each site ( or qubit ) is 2 . for these systems ,",
    "the entanglement of formation , i.e. , the concurrence@xcite , is often used as a measure of pairwise entanglement between two qubits .",
    "such measure is only valid for @xmath2 systems .",
    "if the degrees of freedom at each qubit is larger than 2 ( for example , the spin 1 system or systems consisting of fermions with spin ) , how to quantity the entanglement of arbitrary entangled state is a challenging issue .",
    "several studies @xcite were devoted to this issue . for example , mintert _ et al .",
    "_ obtained a lower bound for the concurrence of mixed bipartite quantum states in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "nevertheless , it is still very difficult to provide a reliable measure for the pairwise entanglement of systems with the number of local states larger than 2 . to the best of our knowledge , none of previous work investigated the pairwise entanglement for systems consisting of electrons with spin , such as the hubbard model ,",
    "although there were a few works studied the local entanglement of fermionic models @xcite .    in this paper , we introduce and study the fermionic concurrence by using the extended hubbard dimer as an example .",
    "besides its importance in exploring many - body correlation in condensed matter physics , a dimer system also has potential utility in the design of quantum device@xcite . by considering the pauli s principle ,",
    "we first illustrate how to quantify the fermionic concurrence in the hubbard model and formulate it in terms of fermion occupation and correlation so one can easily calculate it . then based on the exact solution of the hubbard dimer",
    ", we obtain the result at the ground state and show that the fermionic concurrence could be used to distinguish state exhibiting charge - density correlation from state exhibiting spin - density correlation .",
    "we also study its behavior at finite temperatures @xcite , and find that it is a decreasing function of temperature .",
    "moreover , we investigate the behavior of the concurrence under a nonuniform local potential and magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we find that the concurrence could be modulated by these local fields .",
    "our work therefore not only provides a possible way to investigate the pairwise entanglement in the electronic system , but also enriches our physical intuition on the systems with both charge and spin degree of freedom .",
    "some results are instructive for future experiments .",
    "the hamiltonian of the one - dimensional extended hubbard model reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 create and annihilate an electron of spin @xmath7 at site @xmath8 , respectively , and the hoping amplitude @xmath9 is set to unit .",
    "at each site , there are four possible states , @xmath10-site system is of @xmath11 dimension , and @xmath12 are its natural bases .",
    "therefore any state in such a system can be expressed as a superposition of the above bases .",
    "we consider reduced density matrix @xmath13 of site @xmath8 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the thermal density matrix of the system , and @xmath16 stands for tracing over all sites except the freedom of @xmath8th and @xmath14th site .",
    "thus @xmath17 defines the quantum correlation between site @xmath8 and site @xmath14 .",
    "however , since there does not exist a well - defined entanglement measurement for a mixed state of @xmath18 bipartite systems , it is impossible to study the entanglement between two sites exactly .",
    "fortunately , the hilbert space of site @xmath8 and @xmath14 can be expressed in a direct - product form of electrons with spin up and spin down , that is , for site @xmath8 and @xmath14 , we have two subspaces , one with the bases @xmath19 , and the other one with @xmath20 symmetry",
    ". the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) possesses u(1)@xmath21su(2 ) symmetry , i.e. , it is invariant under the gauge transformation @xmath22 and spin rotation @xmath23 , which manifest the charge and spin conservation .",
    "the latter implies the absence of coherent superposition between configurations with different eigenvalues of @xmath24 .",
    "thus the reduced density of electrons with spin - up on two sites has the form @xmath25 in the standard bases latexmath:[$|0 , 0\\rangle , |0 , \\uparrow\\rangle ,    density matrix @xmath17 are related to single occupation and correlations between the two sites , @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the expectation value of the corresponding operator .",
    "we use the concurrence as a measure of entanglement for such two - qubit system .",
    "it is defined in terms of the spectrum of the matrix @xmath29@xcite where @xmath30 .",
    "precisely , if @xmath31s are eigenvalues of @xmath29 and @xmath32 , the concurrence can then be calculated as @xmath33.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since there exists a monotonous relation between the concurrence and the entanglement of formation @xmath34 , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 @xcite , we will hereafter use the concurrence instead of entanglement of formation in our study . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : reducemat ] ) , the fermionic concurrence can be calculated as @xmath37",
    "in this section , we consider a model which consists of two sites and two electrons , because not only can it be exactly solved , but also it gives us a clear physical picture .",
    "the hamiltonian for the dimer reads @xmath38 in the standard bases @xmath39 of the reduced subspace with zero magnetization : @xmath40 , @xmath41 is a @xmath42 matrix @xmath43 and we can easily obtain its eigenfunction @xmath44 + \\frac{\\cos\\theta}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[|\\uparrow , \\downarrow\\rangle +    & & \\psi_2=\\frac{\\cos\\theta}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[|\\uparrow\\downarrow , 0 \\rangle + |0 , \\uparrow\\downarrow\\rangle\\right ] - \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[|\\uparrow , \\downarrow\\rangle +    & & \\psi_3=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[|\\uparrow\\downarrow , 0 \\rangle -    & & \\psi_4=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[|\\uparrow , \\downarrow\\rangle -    @xmath45 is defined as @xmath46 the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath47 > from the ground - state wavefunction , we have @xmath48 thus , the fermionic concurrence takes the form of @xmath49     and @xmath1 .",
    "the curves in the @xmath50 plane constitutes a contour map , and the thick line denotes the local extremum .",
    "[ figure_vuc ] , width=321 ]    ) as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath51 .",
    "[ figure_ve0 ] , width=321 ]     of the fermionic concurrence as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "[ figure_tth ] , width=321 ]    clearly , the ground - state wavefunction simultaneously comprises the states of the double occupied state @xmath52 and the single occupied state @xmath53 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath45 determines which of them dominates in the ground state . from its definition , it is easy to learn that the line @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath55 , separates the two regions .",
    "one region dominated by @xmath56 corresponds to the charge - density - wave state for a large system , and the other one dominated by @xmath57 , and shows the mirror symmetry along the line @xmath58 ( see figure [ figure_vuc ] ) .    at finite temperatures , the expectation value of a given operator @xmath59 is @xmath60 , where @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the partition function , and @xmath63 denotes the energy spectra . for the present model , we should also take into account states in the subspace with @xmath64 besides that of @xmath40 .",
    "then we have two additional states @xmath65 with the same eigenvalue @xmath66 .",
    "thus the fermionic concurrence of the hubbard dimer takes the form , @xmath67 .",
    "\\label{eq : contemp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is not difficult to prove that the above expression is a decreasing function of @xmath51 , as shown in figure [ figure_ve0 ] for a specific value of @xmath68 .    in the high temperature limit , @xmath69 ,",
    "the boltzmann weight of each eigenstate becomes almost equal , so the first term in the square brackets of eq .",
    "( [ eq : contemp ] ) becomes negative and we have a vanishing fermionic concurrence .",
    "hence we expect that there exists a threshold temperature @xmath70 at which the concurrence becomes zero .",
    "precisely , it is determined by @xmath71 clearly , the hoping - correlation @xmath72 arises from the state of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and charge correlation @xmath75 from @xmath76 .",
    "since the boltzmann weight @xmath77 of @xmath73 is always larger than @xmath78 , the term of absolute value is then positive for finite @xmath51 .",
    "however , the term @xmath79 in the expression of boltzmann wight breaks the mirror symmetry of the fermionic concurrence at the ground - state along the line @xmath54 .",
    "for example , the concurrence in the fourth quadrant of the @xmath80 plane is more susceptive to thermal fluctuation and might be easily suppressed to zero than other quadrants .",
    "therefore , in different quadrants , the effect of thermal fluctuation is quite different . then from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tccond ] ) , we obtain a slope - like threshold temperature for the concurrence ( see figure [ figure_tth ] ) .",
    "( @xmath81 instead of @xmath82 as an indictor for axes ) and v at the ground - state . here , @xmath83 .",
    "[ figure_vu00 ] , width=321 ]",
    "in this section , we would like to consider the behavior of the concurrence under an external field . in general , a uniform external field , like the local potential or the magnetic field , suppresses the concurrence since it frustrates the hoping process .",
    "thus we are only interested in the case with a nonuniform field . moreover , differing from the previous investigation where calculations were done for canonical ensembles , we perform calculation for grand canonical ensembles .",
    "the first case we consider is to add site energy term to the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltoina_twosite ] ) @xmath84 for simplicity , we set @xmath85 , since the main physics is not changed under this condition .",
    "( @xmath81 instead of @xmath82 as an indictor for axes ) and v at @xmath86 . here",
    "[ figure_vu01 ] , width=321 ]     and v at the ground - state . here",
    "[ figure_vb00 ] , width=321 ]     and v at @xmath86 . here",
    "[ figure_vb01 ] , width=321 ]    we show the fermionic concurrence as a function of @xmath82 and @xmath1 as well as its corresponding contour map in the ground - state for a specific value of @xmath83 in fig .",
    "[ figure_vu00 ] .",
    "clearly the ground - state phase diagram can be obtained from the contour map .",
    "the area outside the arc is the spin singlet state described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gsss ] ) , while the inside area is one - particle state .",
    "thus the arc in the contour - map is just the level crossing point for different states",
    ". the level - crossing also leads to a jump on the surface of the concurrence in the @xmath87 plane . since the experiments are always done at finite temperatures , it is useful to investigate the effect of thermal fluctuation .",
    "we show the dependence of the fermionic concurrence on @xmath82 and @xmath1 at @xmath86 in fig .",
    "[ figure_vu01 ] where we observe that the jump at the level - crossing point in fig .",
    "[ figure_vu00 ] is eliminated by the thermal fluctuation .",
    "we find , at some points , eg . , @xmath83 and @xmath88 , the concurrence is small when @xmath89 .",
    "if we change the value of @xmath82 the thermal concurrence can be increased substantially .",
    "such a role played by the local potential is important , because the change of @xmath82 in principle can be realized by the electric field so it provides a possible way to control the magnitude of the concurrence .",
    "the second case we consider is to add a zeeman - like term to the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltoina_twosite ] ) @xmath90 for simplicity , we again set @xmath91 .",
    "we show the concurrence as a function of @xmath92 and @xmath1 for a specific value of @xmath83 in the ground state in fig .",
    "[ figure_vb00 ] , and at @xmath86 in fig .",
    "[ figure_vb01 ] , respectively .",
    "similar to the first case , the magnetic field may also induce the level - crossing in the ground - state , which may lead to a quantum phase transition .",
    "the induced level - crossing results in a jump on the surface of the concurrence in the @xmath93 plane .",
    "such a jump is blurred by the thermal fluctuation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_vb01 ] .",
    "here we have an interesting phenomena : although the fermionic concurrence is defined in a single sector , such as for spin - up electrons only , it can still be modulated by the other sector ( spin - down electron ) through magnetic field .",
    "for the present case , the magnetic field does not always decrease the concurrence , it may actually increase the concurrence in some regions .",
    "therefore , a nonuniform magnetic field can be in favor of the entanglement of formation between two qubits .",
    "in summary , we first presented a possible way to study the concurrence as a measure of pairwise entanglement for fermionic systems .",
    "then we studied its behavior in the hubbard dimer both at zero and finite temperatures .",
    "it was interesting to observe that the classification of two different regions , one dominated by the charge - density correlation @xmath94 $ ] while the other one dominated by the spin - density correlation @xmath95 for general @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and found that it is a decreasing function of the temperature , which leads to a condition of the threshold temperature where the concurrence vanishes .",
    "we then obtained the threshold temperature as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 numerically .",
    "our method , as we pointed out in the introduction , could be easily extended to other electronic systems .",
    "results obtained in this paper help us gain more insight into physical properties of strongly correlated systems . moreover , we studied the role of nonuniform local potential as well as magnetic field for the extended hubbard dimer .",
    "we found that both of them can be used to modulate the concurrence .",
    "though our analysis is based on a specific value of @xmath83 , the main physics is the same for other positive @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we want to point out that although results obtained in this paper are for a 2-site ( dimer ) system , their qualitative features should be the same for big size system ."
