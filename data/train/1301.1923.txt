    "in evolutionary processes , populations acquire changes to their gene content by mutational or recombinational events during reproduction .",
    "if those changes improve the adaptation of the organism to its environment , individuals carrying the modified genome have a better chance to survive and leave more offspring in the next generation . through the interplay of",
    "repeated mutation and selection , the genetic structure of the population evolves and beneficial alleles increase in frequency . in a constant environment",
    "the population may thus end up in a well adapted state , where beneficial mutations are rare or entirely absent and only combinations of several mutations can further increase fitness .    to describe this kind of process ,",
    "sewall wright introduced the notion of a fitness landscape @xcite . here , the genotype is encoded by the coordinates of some suitable space and the degree of adaptation or reproductive success is modeled as a real number , called fitness , which is identified with the height of the landscape above the corresponding genotype .",
    "the evolutionary process of repeated mutation and selection is thus depicted as a hill climbing process .",
    "mutations lead to the exploration of new genotypes and selection forces populations to move preferentially to genotypes with larger fitness .",
    "if more than one mutation is necessary to increase fitness , the population has reached a local fitness peak .",
    "note that some caution is necessary when applying this picture , as the way in which genotypes are connected to one another does not correspond to the topology of a low - dimensional euclidean space but is more appropriately described by a graph or network ( see below ) .",
    "the underlying structure is well known from other areas of science , such as spin glasses in statistical physics @xcite and optimization problems in computer science @xcite .",
    "the concept of fitness landscapes has been very fruitful for the understanding of evolutionary processes .",
    "while earlier work in this field has been largely theoretical and computational , in recent years an increasing amount of experimental fitness data for mutational landscapes has become available @xcite , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "analysis of such data sets provides us with the possibility of a better understanding of the biological mechanisms that shape fitness landscapes and helps us to build better models .",
    "thus , identifying properties of fitness landscapes that yield relevant information on evolution is an important task .",
    "one such property that has attracted considerable interest is epistasis @xcite .",
    "epistasis implies that the change in fitness that is caused by a specific mutation depends on the configurations at other loci , or groups of loci , in the genome . in other words , epistasis is the interaction between different loci in their effect on fitness .",
    "interactions that only affect the strength of the mutational effect are referred to as magnitude epistasis , while interactions that change a mutation from beneficial to deleterious or vice versa are referred to as sign epistasis @xcite . in the absence of sign epistasis",
    ", the fitness landscape contains only a single peak and fitness values fall off monotonically with distance to that peak .",
    "if sign epistasis is present , the landscape can present several peaks and valleys , which has important implications for the mutational accessibility of the different genotypes @xcite and shortens the path to the next fitness optimum @xcite .",
    "thus the absence of sign epistasis implies a smooth landscape , while landscapes with sign epistasis are rugged .    beyond the question of the presence of epistasis",
    ", one would like to be able to make more detailed statements about _ how much _ of it is present or _ in which way _ epistasis is realized in the landscape .",
    "a very helpful tool to answer these kinds of questions is the fourier decomposition of fitness landscapes introduced in ref .",
    "this decomposition makes use of graph theory to expand the landscape into components that correspond to interactions between loci .",
    "the coefficients of the decomposition corresponding to interactions between a given number of loci can be combined to yield the _",
    "amplitude spectrum_. calculating amplitude spectra numerically for data obtained from models or experiments is straightforward in principle , but so far only a small part of the information contained in the spectra is actually used .",
    "to improve this situation , it is important to understand how biologically meaningful features of a fitness landscape are reflected in its amplitude spectrum .    in this paper , we take a first step in this direction by analytically calculating spectra for some of the most popular landscape models : the @xmath0-model introduced by kauffman @xcite , two versions of the rough mount fuji ( rmf ) model @xcite , and a generic model with correlations that decay exponentially with distance on the landscape .",
    "thanks to the linearity of the amplitude decomposition , linear superpositions of these landscapes can also be treated .",
    "we calculate the spectra by exploiting their connection to fitness correlation functions originally established in ref .",
    "moreover , we compare some experimentally obtained spectra to the predictions of the models to see what features can be explained by these models and which can not . in the next section",
    "we begin by introducing the definitions of fitness landscapes and their amplitude spectra on more rigorous mathematical grounds .",
    "on the molecular level the genotype of an organism is encoded in a sequence of letters taken from the alphabet @xmath1 of nucleotide base pairs with cardinality @xmath2 .",
    "point mutations replace single letters by others , altering the sequence and therefore the properties of the organism .",
    "a similar description applies to the space of proteins , where the cardinality of the encoding alphabet equals the number of amino acids @xcite .",
    "by contrast , in the context of classical genetics the units making up the genotype are genes occurring in different variants ( alleles ) , which again can be described as letters in some alphabet @xcite .",
    "this provides a coarse - grained view of the genome in which also complex mutational events are represented by replacing one allele by another .    for simplicity",
    ", fitness landscapes are often defined on sequences comprised of elements of a _ binary _ alphabet @xmath3 , where a common choice is @xmath4 . in the present article",
    "we prefer the symmetric alphabet @xmath5 for mathematical convenience @xcite . referring to the discussion in the preceding paragraph ,",
    "we emphasize that the elements of the binary alphabet do not generally stand for bases or encoded proteins but rather indicate whether a particular mutation is present in a gene or not @xcite .",
    "therefore the restriction to single changes in the sequence does not imply that the treatment is limited to point mutations .",
    "all possible sequences of a given length @xmath6 constructed from the alphabet @xmath7 with cardinality @xmath8 form a metric space called the _ hamming space _ @xmath9 .",
    "it can be expressed as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the cartesian product and @xmath12 is the complete graph with @xmath13 nodes . for a binary alphabet",

    "is said to be _ rugged _ , while landscapes containing no epistasis or only magnitude epistasis are called _",
    "smooth_. non - epistatic landscapes are also called _ additive _ , as here the individual effects of mutations add up independently .",
    "the presence of sign epistasis severely limits which paths on the landscape are accessible to evolution @xcite .",
    "landscapes that display reciprocal sign epistasis may contain several local fitness maxima @xcite , while those that do not have a single maximum .",
    "the existence of reciprocal sign epistasis is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the existence of multiple maxima . for an example of a sufficient condition for multiple maxima based on local properties of the landscape see @xcite .",

    "the simplest random field model of a fitness landscape is the _ house - of - cards _ ( hoc ) model @xcite . in this model , the fitness values",

    "( [ eq : bq ] ) .",
    "although the hoc - model has been widely used for the modeling of adaptation @xcite , there is by now substantial experimental evidence that the assumption of uncorrelated fitness values overestimates the ruggedness of real fitness landscapes @xcite .",
    "it is therefore necessary to consider more complex models , which include fitness correlations in a biologically meaningful way .",
    "a prototypical model with tunable ruggedness is kauffman s @xmath0-model @xcite , which assumes random epistatic interactions within groups of loci of fixed size and fixed membership . in the classical version ,",
    "each locus @xmath23 from a sequence of total length @xmath6 interacts with a set of @xmath106 other loci @xmath107 from the same sequence , which together with the locus @xmath41 itself constitute the @xmath0__-neighborhood _ _ of locus @xmath23 .    to take into account more general setups ,",
    "the constraint of @xmath41 being a member of the @xmath23th neighborhood will be relaxed here @xcite .",

    "the fitness is assigned as follows : let @xmath109 be @xmath6 random functions with @xmath110 binary arguments . for each of the @xmath111 combinations of the arguments , the @xmath112 are chosen as i.i.d .",
    "random variables with variance @xmath113 .",
    "the fitness landscape is then defined as @xmath114 thus , each @xmath115 is equivalent to a hoc - landscape of size @xmath110 . for @xmath116 ,",
    "respectively @xmath117 , the landscape is maximally rugged and reduces to the totally uncorrelated hoc -model , while for @xmath118 , respectively @xmath119 , all fitness contributions are independent , and the model is fully additive . by changing @xmath120 the ruggedness of the fitness landscape can be tuned .    to complete the definition of the model , it has to be specified how the elements of the neighborhoods are chosen . in the most commonly used versions of the model , the @xmath120 interacting loci",
    "are either picked at random or taken to be adjacent along the sequence @xcite .",
    "a third possibility is to subdivide the sequence into blocks of size @xmath120 , such that within blocks every locus interacts with every other but blocks are mutually independent @xcite .",
    "although the construction of the neighborhoods affects certain properties of the landscapes such as the number of local fitness maxima @xcite and the evolutionary accessibility of the global maximum @xcite , it turns out that the autocorrelation function does not depend on it .",

    "[ fig : autocorrbplk ] .",

    "as expected , the fourier coefficients vanish for @xmath124 @xcite and the known case of the hoc - model is reproduced for @xmath117 .",
    "moreover , the coefficients satisfy the symmetry @xmath125 and are maximal for @xmath126 , as was previously conjectured in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-model is already a very flexible model and offers many possibilities for tuning .",
    "an even more general model is obtained by considering _",
    "superpositions _ of @xmath0-models , in the sense of @xmath0-fitness landscapes being added independently .",
    "let @xmath127 be a family of @xmath128 @xmath0-fitness landscapes with neighborhood sizes @xmath129 , @xmath130 .",
    "then its superposition @xmath131 is defined by @xmath132 since the different @xmath0-landscapes @xmath133 are independent , the correlation functions are additive , @xmath134 with statistical weights @xmath135 where @xmath136 .",
    "the sum is over all landscapes with neighborhoods of size @xmath23 and contains a zeroth order term that shifts the correlation function by a constant .",
    "the amplitude spectrum of the superposition is thus of the form @xmath137 note that the consistent interpretation of an empirical fitness landscape as a superposition of @xmath0-landscapes requires all @xmath138 to be positive .",
    "nevertheless , it can be useful to consider superpositions containing negative @xmath138 to calculate amplitude spectra of fitness landscapes constructed by different means ( see section [ rmfmodel ] for an example ) .",
    "interestingly , expression ( [ eq : lkcompo ] ) is also obtained from another type of generalized @xmath0-model , giving rise to a different biological interpretation of the decomposition .",
    "consider again fitness values @xmath139 that are constructed as sums of fitnesses corresponding to hoc - landscapes associated to @xmath0-like neighborhoods @xmath140 , @xmath141 where @xmath142 is an integer that can be different from @xmath6 , and @xmath143 is the size of the @xmath23th neighborhood , drawn from some distribution @xmath144 .",
    "furthermore , for simplicity assume that the variances @xmath145 of the @xmath115 are all the same .",
    "the reasoning behind this model is to retain the idea of interacting groups of loci that is inherent in the @xmath0-model , but to relax the rather unrealistic condition that all these groups are of the same size .",
    "rather , it is assumed that there exist some typical distribution for the sizes of the groups .    following the procedure explained in @xcite , the corresponding autocorrelation function",
    "is easily shown to be @xmath146 which trivially leads to expression ( [ eq : lkcompo ] ) with @xmath147 .",
    "the coefficients obtained from the decomposition of experimentally obtained spectra in terms of @xmath0-spectra could therefore also be interpreted as a probability distribution for the sizes of interacting neighborhoods .",
    "again , this interpretation is only consistent if all weights are positive . here",
    ", it seems reasonable to expect that for large enough landscapes @xmath144 should become continuous in the sense that the distribution becomes monotonic over large contiguous parts of its support .",

    "second , sparse fits containing as few nonzero @xmath193 s as possible are carried out to verify if the landscape could be biologically interpreted as a superposition of a small number of @xmath0-landscapes of different interaction ranges .",
    "one way of selecting @xmath193 s that can be neglected in the fit is to identify those coefficients obtained in the full fit that are much smaller than the others . in all cases ,",
    "the term proportional to @xmath179 in ( [ eq : lkcompo ] ) is not considered as it can always be trivially fixed to fit @xmath194 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : empirical ] the data for the normalized amplitudes @xmath195 ( black dots ) is shown together with the fit ( green curve ) and the hoc - component @xmath196 ( red dashed line ) of the fit . for the _",
    "a. niger _ landscape in @xcite error estimates for the fitness values were available @xcite , enabling the calculation of error bars to the spectrum .",
    "this is done by constructing ensembles of landscapes with fitness values @xmath197 , where @xmath198 is the mean of the replicate experimental measurements of the fitness of genotype @xmath16 and the @xmath101 are normally distributed random numbers with @xmath16-dependent standard deviations obtained from the replicate measurements .",
    "note that the influence of the measurement errors on the spectra is very small and only exceeds the symbol size for the highest @xmath53 component ( @xmath199 ) .",
    "at least for this case one can therefore safely exclude that the hoc - component of the spectrum is generated by measurement errors .    as can be seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : empirical](a ) , the spectrum of the yeast landscape @xcite is nicely fitted by an ansatz where only @xmath200 and @xmath201 are assumed to be different from zero .",
    "this is evidently a superposition of an additive and a hoc - landscape and therefore a rmf - landscape .",
    "only the value at @xmath202 seems too small to be fitted by the model .",
    "however , this value corresponds to a single component of the decomposition ( [ eq : ft ] ) and the large deviation may be due to the lack of averaging . also for the _",
    "a. niger _ landscape from @xcite a nice and sparse fit with nonzero coefficients @xmath200 , @xmath203 , and @xmath201 is obtained ( see fig.[fig : empirical](b ) ) .",
    "the significant value of @xmath203 implies that there are important interactions between pairs of loci .",
    "a rmf -landscape is therefore not an appropriate model of this system .",
    "note that this conclusion differs from the analysis presented in @xcite , where a reasonable fit to the rmf - model was found for a particular epistasis measure , the number of accessible pathways .",
    "this illustrates the importance of using more than one topographic measure for the comparison between empirical and model landscapes @xcite . for the spectrum of the 5-epi - aristolochene _",

    "landscape from @xcite , the fitting yields reasonable results for an ansatz allowing only @xmath200 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath201 to be different from 0 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : empirical](c ) ) .",
    "this might indicate that , apart from the non epistatic part and the simple pair interactions , there are one or several groups consisting of six strongly interacting alleles . using the same ansatz for the premnaspirodiene landscape yields less convincing results , as the large @xmath53 part of the spectrum seems to be poorly fitted ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : empirical](d ) ) . introducing more components into the fitting ansatz yields better results for this part of the spectrum , but such ansatzes can hardly be considered sparse anymore .    using the full ansatz to fit the different landscapes",
    "does not yield any qualitative improvement for the first three landscapes and provides no evidence for an underlying continuous neighborhood size distribution @xmath144 . only for the premnaspirodiene _",
    "n. tabacum _ landscape does the fit for the spectrum improve notably , but the obtained spectrum does not support the idea of a continuous distribution of neighborhood sizes ( not shown ) . in general , such a continuous distribution is more likely to emerge for larger landscapes than the relatively small data sets considered here , which suffer from insufficient averaging over groups of loci of different sizes .",
    "one should be aware that failing to obtain a reasonable decomposition of an empirical landscape in terms of @xmath0-spectra does not _ a priori _ rule out the possibility that the landscape is in fact shaped by the mechanisms assumed by a superposition of @xmath0-models .",
    "for example , the failure may be due to an _ inappropriate _ fitness measure , in the following sense .",
    "suppose that there exists a fitness proxy , @xmath205 , whose decomposition in terms of @xmath0-landscapes is sparse , but the proxy actually measured in experiments is @xmath206 , with @xmath207 being some nonlinear function .",
    "the decomposition of @xmath17 may then not be sparse anymore and the biological mechanism that shapes the landscape may be obscured .",
    "finally , it was checked whether any of the spectra are compatible with the expression ( [ eq : bexp ] ) corresponding to an exponentially decaying correlation function , but no reasonable correspondence was found .",
    "of course , this does not allow for the conclusion that exponentially decaying correlations are an unrealistic assumption .",
    "possibly , it may again be necessary to go to larger landscape sizes to see such behavior .",
    "also , the way in which the mutations constituting the landscape are selected may have an influence on the observed correlations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "exploiting the connection between amplitude spectra and fitness autocorrelation functions of fitness landscapes over the boolean hypercube , the amplitude spectrum of kauffman s @xmath0-model was calculated exactly and found to be of the simple form ( [ eq : lkspectra ] ) . by superimposing @xmath0-landscapes the spectra of rmf - type models",
    "could also be obtained .",
    "in addition , an @xmath0-like model with a distribution @xmath144 of neighborhood sizes was introduced and its spectrum was calculated .",
    "such an extension of the @xmath0-model is reasonable , because it can not be assumed in general that every locus interacts with the same number of other loci .",
    "this model thus offers more flexibility to fit experimental data . as a last example , the spectrum of a model with exponentially decaying correlations was computed .",
    "the hoc , rmf and @xmath0-models are frequently used for analyzing evolutionary processes , classifying fitness landscape properties and fitting experimental data .",
    "therefore a lot of effort has been invested in the understanding of these models , but the link to experimental data is still rather weak .",
    "the amplitude spectra calculated in this article should facilitate quantitative comparisons in future studies .",
    "the spectra contain a large amount of information about the landscape topography , and it is important to understand how the spectrum encrypts this information in order to be able to interpret the spectra of measured fitness landscapes . as an exemplary application of our results ,",
    "four experimental landscapes were fitted by means of the model spectra .",
    "three of them could be fitted very nicely with sparse superpositions of @xmath0-models , while for the fourth one the obtained fit seems less convincing . in none of the cases evidence for a continuous neighborhood size distribution @xmath144",
    "was found , which might be due to the small sizes of the landscapes discussed in this article .",
    "we claim that the fitting of amplitude spectra can be a useful tool for data analysis , but it has to be emphasized that the spectra can not be assigned to model landscapes in a unique way . also , the collection of models presented here is by no means exhaustive . obtaining analytical expressions for the amplitude spectra of other classes of fitness landscapes is desirable and should prove helpful in guiding the search for suitable models of experimental landscapes .    finally , it is important to mention that there are interesting and biologically relevant properties of fitness landscapes that can not be obtained from their spectra , such as , for example , the number of local fitness maxima and the number of selectively accessible pathways @xcite . while it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the ruggedness measure @xmath66 based on the fourier decomposition correlates with both quantities , there is no strict correspondence between these measures of epistatic interactions .",
    "amplitude spectra do not distinguish between different kinds of epistasis , i.e.  magnitude , sign , or reciprocal sign epistasis , in a qualitative way .",
    "therefore , if one is interested in this distinction , other epistasis measures have to be included in the analysis .",
