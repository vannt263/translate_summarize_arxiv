    "wilson - type lattice dirac operators are non - normal , i.e. @xmath2 \\ne 0\\,,\\ ] ] and this fact has several important consequences .",
    "the essential difference to normal operators is that they are not diagonalizable by a unitary transformation .",
    "instead they are diagonalizable ( if at all ) by a similarity transformation of the form @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "it follows that for a given eigenvalue @xmath5 there are distinct left @xmath6 and right @xmath7 eigenvectors @xmath8 @xmath9 in the sense that ( in general ) @xmath10 .",
    "this fact must be taken into account when performing the spectral decomposition @xmath11 but also raises the question of an appropriate generalization of the other concepts familiar from the textbook ( hermitian ) quantum mechanics .",
    "for example , if an observable in the continuum is defined as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is an eigenstate of the continuum operator @xmath14  what is the proper generalization for the case where the left and the right eigenvectors are distinct ?    in @xcite",
    "we advocate the use of @xmath15 instead of @xmath16 as a kind of improved observable .",
    "note that in lattice field theory this question is not of importance in the continuum limit , because the difference between the two definitions disappears .",
    "however , this question was also raised in the domain of solid state physics  see @xcite for an interesting discussion .",
    "in this contribution we want to examine a different problem , which is also connected to the non - normality of the wilson - type lattice dirac operators .",
    "the idea to approximate the inverse operator @xmath0 by just a few eigenmodes with eigenvalues close to zero is physically appealing .",
    "one hopes that the lowest modes dominate physics and that the truncated eigenmode expansion @xmath17 with the ordering @xmath18 will be a fair approximation of the proper inverse @xmath19 .",
    "however , in @xcite it was found that such an expansion is unstable and that it does not uniformly saturate by increasing @xmath20 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : b2-nhlr ] where the values of the correlation function for different temporal distances @xmath21 are plotted versus @xmath20 .",
    "( the illustration is just for two dimensional qed on a @xmath22 lattice for @xmath23 , but it should be stressed that for the discussion which follows this is irrelevant  the arguments are pure linear algebra and they will be valid for any physical system and parameter set . )    by a closer examination of pseudospectra ( for more details about pseudospectra see @xcite ) of @xmath14 , we identified that the spikes in fig .",
    "[ fig : b2-nhlr ] correspond essentially to the instabilities due to the non - normality of @xmath14 . for non - normal operators",
    "the truncated eigenmode expansion in the original biorthogonal basis seems to be problematic .",
    "however , one can do better than that .",
    "for any matrix a there exists a so - called singular value decomposition ( svd ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are unitary and @xmath27 is the diagonal matrix with positive or zero entries on the diagonal  the `` singular values '' @xmath28 .",
    "we assume the following ordering : @xmath29 among other interesting properties , one can prove the following theorem ( th . 2.5.3 . in @xcite ) :    if @xmath30 and @xmath31 then @xmath32 i.e. , @xmath33 is the closest matrix to @xmath34 that has rank @xmath20 . in other words ,",
    "the truncation of svd is the optimal approximation to the original matrix for a given @xmath20 .",
    "actually , the drawback is that for a general matrix @xmath34 one needs two sets of vectors : @xmath35-s and @xmath36-s .",
    "however , the situation is better for the wilson - type lattice dirac operators ( and their inverses ) . using the @xmath1-hermiticity property @xmath37 we are going to prove that the truncated svd of @xmath0 is identical to @xmath38 with the ordering according to the absolute values of inverse @xmath39-s : @xmath40 the @xmath39-s and @xmath41-s are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hermitian wilson - dirac operator @xmath42 the hermiticity of @xmath43 follows from the @xmath1-hermiticity property ( [ eq : g5-hermiticity ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath43 is diagonalizable by a unitary transformation @xmath44 and has real eigenvalues @xmath45 , ordered on the diagonal of the diagonal matrix @xmath46 .    per construction",
    ", @xmath47 is a hermitian matrix and it is easy to see that @xmath48 however , by using the singular value decomposition ( [ eq : svd ] ) of @xmath14 it follows that @xmath49 as @xmath26 is unitary and @xmath50 diagonal , one must have ( with appropriate ordering )",
    "@xmath51 i.e. , the singular values of @xmath14 are just the absolute values of the eigenvalues of the hermitian wilson - dirac operator @xmath43 . also , the @xmath52-s should correspond to the @xmath41-s ( there is an arbitrary phase factor , but it cancels in ( [ eq : svd - expansion ] ) ) .",
    "finally , we can rewrite : @xmath53 which makes it obvious that @xmath54 hence , the truncated singular value expansion of @xmath14 is @xmath55 as @xmath0 also satisfies the @xmath1-hermiticity property ( [ eq : g5-hermiticity ] ) , the same reasoning applies and ( [ eq : svd - expansion ] ) follows .",
    "[ fig : b2-svd ] illustrates that , as expected , by using the truncated singular value expansion , non - normal artefacts disappear and the saturation as a function of @xmath20 is superior to the expansion in the eigenmodes of @xmath14 .",
    "this approach has already been successfully used in a realistic qcd setting @xcite .",
