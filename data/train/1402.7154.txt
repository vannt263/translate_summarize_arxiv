    "experiments using stable weakly bound nuclei provide valuable avenues to understand the scattering and reaction with exotic radioactive nuclei . in this context ,",
    "@xmath7li , @xmath8li and @xmath0be beams have been found extremely useful to probe the reaction dynamics around the coulomb barrier @xcite . unlike the reactions with tightly bound nuclei , a substantial contribution of breakup and transfer is observed in case of weakly bound nuclei .",
    "the breakup and transfer may be followed by subsequent fusion of the only a part of the projectile , a process called as incomplete fusion ( icf ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the fusion is classified in terms of complete fusion ( cf ) which refers to fusion of the whole projectile or all its fragments and the total fusion ( tf ) , where the incomplete fusion ( icf ) processes are also included . in fusion measurements involving weakly bound nuclei ,",
    "a large suppression of complete fusion cross section is observed at energies above the coulomb barrier with respect to conventional coupled channels ( cc ) calculations @xcite , that either exclude the breakup and transfer couplings or include them only in an average way .",
    "this suppression is commensurate with the measured icf cross section @xcite .",
    "most of the measurements on suppression are performed with relatively heavy mass targets , because there is difficulty in separating contributions from the cf and the icf in case of light mass targets , as many of the evaporation residues coincide .",
    "the theoretical calculations do not provide unequivocal answers about the coupling effects of breakup and transfer on the fusion cross sections and the cf suppression in case of weakly bound nuclei @xcite .",
    "the observed experimental suppression of complete fusion is often explained by invoking two sets of principles . in the first approach ,",
    "the coupled channel effects due to breakup and/or transfer are shown to alter the fusion cross section .",
    "continuum discretized coupled channels ( cdcc ) for breakup and coupled reaction channels ( crc ) calculations for transfer have been performed to study these dynamic effects arising due to coupling .",
    "the reduction in the fusion cross sections obtained due to the coupled channel effects of breakup process is found to be smaller compared to the suppression seen from the data @xcite .",
    "the continuum - continuum couplings have been responsible for most of the reduction in fusion cross sections with respect to the uncoupled calculations @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "the coupled channel approaches show a small enhancement at energies below the coulomb barrier , somewhat similar but less in magnitude than observed in case of fusion with the stable nuclei @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the cdcc and crc calculations , it is mostly the tf that is calculated , while the icf and cf calculations are not so straightforward , as explained in ref .",
    "the second approach for explaining the cf suppression is based on simple empirical arguments , where the cf cross sections can be estimated by subtracting the measured or calculated icf from the tf cross sections @xcite .",
    "the theoretical modeling for calculating the icf component is still an open challenge , although a stochastic breakup model based on classical trajectories to calculate the icf has been developed in recent years @xcite .",
    "the systematic behaviour of the fusion suppression factors and icf probability as a function of target mass is not well understood , despite the cf experimental data being available for a number of projectile - target systems .",
    "since , the amount of cf suppression observed in experiments with respect to cc calculations compares well with the icf cross section , the icf probability ( @xmath9 ) , defined as @xmath10 , provides an indirect measure of cf suppression factors ( f@xmath11 ) .",
    "recently , gomes _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , attempted to give a universal description of f@xmath11 for the cf of @xmath12be nucleus that is based on the estimation of the icf yield derived from a simple empirical relation given by hinde _",
    "the breakup probability function that depends on the gradient of the nuclear potential along with a exponential dependence on the surface separation was used to estimate the icf probability .",
    "this simple model predicts that the icf component and the f@xmath11 monotonically decrease with the target charge @xmath13 for a given projectile . while the f@xmath11 extracted for the @xmath0be + @xmath5pb and @xmath0be + @xmath4sm are in qualitative agreement with this model , the cf suppression factors derived for the @xmath0be + @xmath2y and @xmath0be + @xmath3sn systems , both measured at barc - tifr pelletron , mumbai are found not to follow this systematics .",
    "this is in contrast to the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is concluded that the cf suppression is nearly independent of target atomic number @xmath13 .    in this paper ,",
    "a new method to calculate the icf is employed that is based on absorption cross sections obtained from the cdcc calculations .",

    "the fusion cross sections can be obtained as the total absorption cross section , which is equal to the difference of the total reaction cross section @xmath31 and the cross section of all explicitly coupled direct reaction channels @xmath32 .",

    "cdcc - crc calculations are performed with the inclusion of the imaginary part of the optical potential for the fragment - target interaction to account for the irreversible loss of flux from the coupled channels set .",
    "if all the dominant direct processes such as breakup and transfer are included , the absorption cross section corresponds to the fusion cross section .",
    "a common approach is to include the short - range imaginary potentials to model the irreversible loss of flux .",
    "the short - range imaginary potential ensures that the total flux in the scattering channels decreases by the absorption when either one or both of the projectile fragments and the target nuclei are in the range of the potential inside the coulomb barrier .",
    "the use of this short - range imaginary potential simulates the use of an incoming wave boundary condition inside the coulomb barrier . in the calculations for the weakly bound nuclei",
    ", the imaginary potentials can be included in different ways and they correspond to different quantities that are calculated @xcite .",
    "the short - range imaginary potentials can be defined either in the coordinates of both projectile fragments relative to the target or in coordinates of only one of the projectile fragments relative to target .    in the calculations presented here ,",
    "the fusion cross sections are first calculated by including the short - range imaginary potentials in the coordinates of both projectile fragments relative to the target . a woods - saxon potential with parameters w@xmath36 = 50 mev , r@xmath36 = 0.9 fm , and a = 0.25 fm is used as the short range imaginary potential ( @xmath37 ) for the fragment - target optical potentials .",
    "the results depend very weakly on the geometry parameters of @xmath37 for any larger depth .",
    "the inclusion of the imaginary potentials in the fragment - target coordinate system ensures the absorption of the c.m . of both @xmath14be and @xmath16 fragments in the fusion reaction and therefore , the calculated value can be compared with the measured total fusion cross sections .",
    "the cdcc calculations are also performed where the @xmath37 is present for only one of the projectile fragments relative to the target , namely , either for the @xmath38 part or for the @xmath39 part .",
    "the unambiguous calculation of icf using the coupled channel is a complicated task as the absorption of flux in the coupled channels calculations includes varying contribution of the icf component depending on the incident energy and the system under study . as with the cf process",
    ", the icf represents the flux that is lost irreversibly from the scattering channels , in this case due to absorption of only part of the projectile .",
    "an approximate estimation of the icf cross sections can be made using the absorption cross sections in the following way .",
    "the cdcc calculations with the breakup couplings only are performed with three choices of optical potentials , where @xmath37 is used for i ) both the projectile fragments relative to the target ( @xmath40 ) ii ) the @xmath38 part only ( @xmath41 ) and iii ) the @xmath39 part only ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "however , in all these calculations , an additional @xmath37 without any real part is also present in the center of mass of the whole projectile for the projectile - target radial motion @xcite .",
    "the use of additional imaginary potential is justified as the results are found to be insensitive to any larger depth of the @xmath37 than what is used .",
    "the inclusion of the extra @xmath37 is necessary only in the case , where @xmath42 is used , to correctly calculate the cf component corresponding to @xmath43 + target part . in the other two cases , the additional @xmath37 does not matter , as the results are nearly the same whether it is included or not in the calculation .",
    "the absorption cross sections in three cases represent cross sections for i ) complete fusion ( @xmath44 ) + @xmath14be partial fusion ( @xmath45 ) + @xmath16 partial fusion ( @xmath46 ) ii ) @xmath44 + @xmath45 and iii ) @xmath44 + @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "these three calculations together are used to estimate the @xmath45 and @xmath46 explicitly .",
    "in fact , @xmath45 is equivalent to @xmath47 , as it is more likely that only one of the @xmath48 particles may fuse with the target nucleus , since the @xmath48 particles from the decay of @xmath14be nucleus are emitted back to back in the @xmath14be rest frame .",
    "the total icf can be then evaluated as sum of @xmath47 and @xmath46 .",
    "in addition , icf can also arise from the 1n transfer into bound states of the target nucleus followed by the breakup of @xmath14be nucleus and the subsequent absorption of only one of the @xmath48 particles .",
    "in fact , the transfer process has been found to predominantly trigger the breakup process in sub - barrier reactions of other weakly bound projectiles @xmath49li on different targets @xcite .",
    "the combined process of transfer followed by breakup and absorption of one @xmath48 particle can be considered as an important source of icf formation .",
    "the transfer cross sections calculated using cdcc - crc calculations with @xmath40 for all the targets are taken as an approximate measure of the icf formation due to transfer followed by breakup . here , a reasonable assumption is made that 1n transfer is always followed by the breakup of the @xmath14be nucleus into two @xmath48 particles and the capture of one of the @xmath48 particle .",
    "it must be mentioned that the breakup and transfer calculations performed in this work , only take into account the @xmath14be+n breakup of @xmath12be or 1n transfer to the @xmath14be@xmath50 . the breakup and icf is possible also through the @xmath51he+@xmath52he two body decay @xcite , and the transfer via the @xmath14be@xmath53 state .",
    "however , these components are estimated to be small compared to the dominant modes considered here @xcite and hence , these have not been considered .",
    "the fusion excitation functions are calculated for various target systems to enable a direct comparison with the data .",
    "the fusion data for various systems along with the results of calculations are shown in fig .",
    "the absorption cross sections at different energies obtained from the cdcc - crc calculations using @xmath40 optical potentials are compared with the measured fusion cross sections taken from the literature @xcite . in addition to the experimental total fusion cross sections , the complete fusion data is also plotted , wherever it is available .",
    "the calculations with only the bare potentials are shown by dotted line , whereas the calculations that include the breakup couplings and the breakup + transfer couplings are shown by dashed lines and the solid lines respectively . in comparison to the calculation with the bare potential ,",
    "the calculations with the breakup couplings show a general enhancement of the fusion cross section for all target systems for the whole energy range .",
    "the enhancement is very pronounced at energies below the coulomb barrier for all target systems , except for the @xmath12be+@xmath1si case , where data below the barrier is not available .",
    "this observation of enhancement may be linked to the attractive real and absorptive imaginary polarization potentials that are obtained due to the @xmath54 couplings within the @xmath14be+n model of @xmath12be breakup @xcite .",
    "inclusion of single - neutron stripping coupling does not give any significant effects , except a small reduction of the fusion cross section over the whole energy range .",
    "again , this reduction seems to be consistent with the repulsive polarization potentials that arise due to the coupling of @xmath55-value transfer channels .",
    "however , the transfer coupling effects on fusion are comparatively smaller than the large effect observed in the near - barrier elastic scattering of @xmath12be+@xmath5pb system @xcite .",
    "the light system @xmath12be+@xmath1si has also significant transfer coupling effect despite having the higher q - value for the 1n transfer reaction .",
    "a reasonably good description of the fusion data for all the target systems is obtained by the cdcc - crc calculations using @xmath40 optical potentials as given by the solid lines .",
    "particularly , the available total fusion data for @xmath12be + @xmath4sm and @xmath12be + @xmath5pb systems are well described by the calculations , at above barrier energies .",
    "this is the energy region from where the suppression of the complete fusion is evaluated in terms of reduction with respect to coupled channels calculations .",
    "the discrepancy observed between the calculation and the measured data at lower energies indicates that a weaker absorption of flux is required from the breakup and transfer channels into the fusion process than that predicted by the calculations .",
    "indeed , the cdcc calculations with the potential where the imaginary potential for the n - target system is switched off ( @xmath41 ) , give a better description of the data at the energies below the coulomb barrier .",
    "the calculations using @xmath41 with only breakup couplings are shown by dashed - dot - dot line in fig .",
    "similar calculations using the core - target potential only have also been performed by ito _",
    "@xcite , for the fusion reactions of neutron - halo nuclei with a three - body time - dependent wave - packet method .",
    "the calculated cross section in this case , corresponds to the complete fusion and the incomplete core fusion , where the neutron escapes .",
    "the cdcc - crc calculations using the potentials having short range imaginary potentials for both projectile fragments , are utilized to investigate the systematic behaviour of breakup and transfer cross sections as a function of incident energy .",
    "the breakup process is expected to be the dominant process of @xmath48 production for the heavier systems .",
    "in contrast , the transfer process will depend on the structure of the target and the final residual nuclei .",
    "the breakup probabilities ( @xmath56 ) and transfer probabilities ( @xmath57 ) are calculated as the ratio of calculated breakup and transfer cross sections with the calculated reaction cross sections at each energy using cdcc - crc calculations with @xmath40 optical potentials .",
    "the plots of @xmath56 and @xmath57 are shown by dashed - dot - dot and dotted lines respectively , in fig .",
    "[ btr ] for different target systems .",
    "the breakup probabilities remain approximately constant over the energy range above the coulomb barrier while there is a small increase below the barrier for all target systems , except for the @xmath12be + @xmath1si system .",
    "the increase at the sub - barrier energies , is consistent with the measured breakup probabilities in ref.@xcite which shows an exponential rise with increasing energy . at energies above the barrier ,",
    "the probability of charged fragment capture by the target is approximately constant leading to a constant removal of flux from the breakup or transfer channel at these energies .",
    "the breakup and transfer contributions at higher energies are comparable for the @xmath1si and @xmath2y cases , while the breakup dominates over the transfer contribution in other cases . at lower energies ,",
    "the transfer contribution is significant only in the @xmath1si and @xmath5pb cases .",
    "it is quite interesting to note that there is an almost constant variation of the @xmath56 at higher energies for the systems with different nuclear sizes and structure .    as pointed out earlier , the unambiguous calculation of icf is not so straightforward . in the present case ,",
    "the @xmath14be + n breakup of @xmath12be and one neutron transfer from @xmath12be are expected to be the dominant sources of icf formation and inclusive @xmath48 production .",
    "therefore , an accurate calculation of icf cross section would require to follow and calculate the absorption probability of the @xmath48 particles and neutron after the breakup and transfer .",
    "as described before , neutron incomplete fusion ( @xmath46 ) and the @xmath48 incomplete fusion ( @xmath47 ) due to breakup process only , can be calculated using the absorption cross sections from the different choices of imaginary potential using cdcc calculations .",
    "the probabilities for the icf of neutron ( @xmath58 ) and @xmath48 ( @xmath59 ) are calculated as the ratio of calculated @xmath46 and @xmath47 with the total fusion cross sections calculated using cdcc calculations with @xmath40 at each energy .",
    "the contribution of @xmath58 and @xmath58 + @xmath59 for all the systems are shown in fig .",
    "[ btr ] by the dashed lines and solid lines , respectively .",
    "these plots show that at lower energies @xmath58 is dominant compared to the @xmath59 .",
    "the calculated icf fractions as described above , can also be used to estimate the inclusive @xmath48 cross section .",
    "the @xmath48 production results from the icf as the other fragments @xmath16 and @xmath48 from these processes may fuse with the target or the residual nuclei . in addition , the @xmath48 production takes place also from the exclusive breakup and transfer processes , where the resulting @xmath14be decays into two @xmath48 particles . therefore , using the breakup and transfer cross sections along with the icf cross sections , a measure of inclusive @xmath48 production cross section can be obtained .",
    "the icf probabilities ( @xmath9 ) extracted from the experimental data for two systems @xmath12be + @xmath4sm and @xmath12be + @xmath5pb are also plotted in fig .",
    "it is compared with the calculated values of @xmath58 + @xmath59 for these systems .",
    "the comparison is qualitative in view of the fact that the experimental measurements of icf do not distinguish whether the neutron is absorbed or not .",
    "the icf probability ( @xmath9 ) and the cf suppression factors ( @xmath60 ) are related quantities as the measured icf cross sections are found to have the same magnitude as the difference of tf and cf cross sections @xcite . in the case of @xmath12be fusion",
    ", the measurements of the cf does nt necessarily exclude the icf component due to neutron fusion .",
    "the measured icf may be only due to the fusion of @xmath48 resulting from @xmath14be decay , subsequent to the @xmath14be + n breakup .",

    "an approximate estimate of this contribution can be obtained by a quantity @xmath63 , which is defined as the ratio of transfer cross section with the total fusion cross sections that are calculated using the cdcc - crc calculations with @xmath40 .",
    "it must be remarked though , while the variation of icf probability ( @xmath9 ) due to breakup process can be taken as a continuous behaviour with the target mass , the @xmath63 only indicates the behaviour for the systems for which the calculations are performed .",

    "the large fusion suppression observed in @xmath12be + @xmath64w fusion data may be due to even higher transfer contribution as the measured stripping cross section in that case suggests @xcite .",

    "the cf suppression factors calculated as the icf probabilities show a systematic behaviour with respect to different target masses and they remain approximately constant at energies above the barrier for all the systems considered .",
    "the icf contribution due to transfer varies depending on the structure of target and the residual nuclei .",
    "the exclusive measurements of icf and cf cross sections with different weakly bound projectiles , especially in the light target mass region , wherever possible , are needed to further verify this proposition .",
    "simultaneously , an integrated theoretical modeling of the icf and cf processes will be helpful to understand the phenomena of complete fusion suppression in case of weakly bound projectiles .",
