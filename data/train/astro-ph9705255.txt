    "although the x - ray emission from seyfert galaxies is still not fully understood , there are indications that the mystery is starting to unfold .",
    "it is now believed that the emission mechanism is most likely thermal ( see , e.g. , svensson 1996 ; zdziarski et al . 1996 ) .",
    "a flattening of the spectrum above about 10 kev ( e.g. , nandra & pounds 1994 ) strongly suggests the presence of a component due to the reflection of the intrinsic x - ray spectrum by nearby cold matter , which means that the x - ray emitting region is probably located above the accretion disk .",
    "in addition , the fact that the uv and x - ray luminosities from these sources are comparable and that their time variations are tightly correlated suggests that the uv and x - ray emitting regions are located very close to each other .",
    "there are also indications that the broad and redshifted fe k@xmath5 line originates within the cold accretion disk which extends inwards to the last stable orbit ( e.g. , iwasawa et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "many of these observational characteristics fit within the currently popular two - phase patchy accretion disk - corona model ( haardt & maraschi 1991 ; haardt & maraschi 1993 ; haardt et al .",
    "1994 ) , in which the x - ray emitting region is located within ` active regions ' ( ar ) above the disk , where the energy dissipation rate greatly exceeds the local gravitational dissipation inside the disk  at least for the lifetime of the region .",
    "recent calculations by zdziarski et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show that the thomson optical depth @xmath1 in seyfert galaxies must be close to unity . from a theoretical perspective , this is highly significant given that the sample of sources covers a broad range of black hole masses , accretion rates , and other system parameters .",
    "thus , it is not easy to understand why @xmath2 , especially since the energy transport mechanism has not yet been identified .",
    "haardt et al .",
    "( 1994 ) suggested that the ars may be magnetic flares occurring above the accretion disk s atmosphere and showed that their compactness @xmath6 may be quite high ( @xmath7 ) , so that pairs can be created .",
    "the local compactness parameter @xmath6 is defined as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the source luminosity , @xmath10 is the source size and @xmath11 is the thomson cross section . in principle , it is possible to obtain still larger values for the compactness parameter ( @xmath12 few hundred ; see nayakshin & melia 1997a ) , thus creating enough pairs to account for the observed @xmath13 ( zdziarski et al .",
    "this explanation for the observed value of @xmath2 based on the pair equilibrium condition , however , relies on the assumption that the particles are confined to a rigid box , so that no pressure constraints need to be imposed .",
    "this is unphysical for a magnetic flare where the particles are free to move along the magnetic field lines .",
    "therefore , as far as the two - phase model _ without _ a proper pressure equilibrium condition is concerned , the thomson optical depth is a parameter , rather than a calculable quantity .    in this _ letter _ , we attempt to address this question of pressure equilibrium during an energetic magnetic flare above the surface of a cold accretion disk .",
    "we show that under the assumptions ( i ) that the energy is supplied to the x - ray emitting region by magnetohydrodynamic waves with a group velocity close to the speed of light and ( ii ) that the emitting region has a very large compactness parameter @xmath14 , the pressure equilibrium between the outwardly directed x - ray flux and the inwardly directed mhd waves leads to the requirement that @xmath15-@xmath16 , in accordance with the apparently `` universal '' value of @xmath1 seen in seyfert galaxies",
    ". we will also show that both assumptions are likely to be valid during a physically plausible magnetic flare above the surface of a cold accretion disk .",
    "the ` universal ' x - ray spectral index of seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , nandra & pounds 1994 ) suggests that the emission mechanism is thermal comptonization with a @xmath17-parameter close to one ( haardt & maraschi 1991 ; haardt & maraschi 1993 ; fabian 1994 ) . for the emission to be dominated by comptonization",
    ", the compactness parameter needs to be large ( @xmath14 ; e.g. , fabian 1994 ) .",
    "observations of seyfert galaxies point to a global compactness parameter @xmath18 ( svensson 1996 and references cited therein ) .    for electrons and protons at a single temperature @xmath19 and an electron number density @xmath20 with the assumption of neutrality ,",
    "the gas pressure is @xmath21 .",
    "the radiation energy density may be recast in terms of the luminosity @xmath9 of the source , and therefore its compactness @xmath6 .",
    "the total pressure is @xmath22{\\rm , } \\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the dimensionless electron temperature .",
    "the compton @xmath17-parameter for thermal electrons is @xmath24 ( see rybicki & lightman 1979 ) and is of order 1 .",
    "thus , since the dimensionless gas pressure in equation ( 1 ) is always smaller than @xmath17 , the radiation pressure dominates over the gas pressure in a one - temperature plasma when @xmath14 .",
    "one consequence of this is that the amount of energy escaping from the source even during one light crossing time is larger than the total particle thermal energy .",
    "thus , there must be an agent that energizes the particles to enable them to radiate at this high rate , and the presence of this agent must be dynamically consistent with the state of the system .",
    "we foresee two possibilities for the nature of this ` agent ' : ( i ) the gravitational field , and ( ii ) an external flow of energy into the system .",
    "these two cases are quite distinct physically .    insofar as the first possibility is concerned , the gravitational potential energy of the plasma ( primarily that of the protons ) is dissipated as the gas sinks deeper into the well of the black hole .",
    "the gravitational field does not provide a pressure , but it does compress the gas . however , this leads to an internal ( radiation plus gas ) pressure that varies from source to source as the physical conditions change .",
    "there does not appear to be a scale that sets @xmath1 to have a value of @xmath25 .",
    "for example , in standard accretion disk theory , the inner radiation pressure - dominated regime has an optical depth that depends on several parameters , such as the accretion rate and the @xmath5-parameter ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "the @xmath5-parameter reflects the rate at which the protons ` use up ' their potential energy , and so a change in this rate leads to a change in the equilibrium optical depth .",
    "it is even less obvious why @xmath1 should be @xmath26 in the gas pressure dominated regimes since there the pressure has no reference to @xmath1 at all .",
    "it seems that when the pressure equilibrium is dictated by the gravitational field ( e.g. , due to a compression of the x - ray emitting region ) , the thomson optical depth should span a range of values depending on the source geometry , the specific parameter values and the particle interactions assumed to operate in the source .",
    "this is not so when the energy is supplied to the x - ray emitting region by an inflow of energy , e.g. , via a magnetic field .",
    "the principal difference between the two cases is that the dynamic portion of the magnetic field supplies a `` ram '' pressure that is related in a known way to its energy density .",
    "if the magnetic energy flux into the x - ray emitting region is known , this also constrains the inwardly directed momentum flux ( the compressional force ) into the system .",
    "thus , the compressional force exerted on the active region by the magnetic field is expected to correlate with the source luminosity .",
    "what makes this useful in terms of setting the optical depth of the system is that a similar correlation exists between the luminosity and the outwardly directed radiation pressure in the emitting region .",
    "but in this case , the pressure also depends on @xmath1 . assuming a spherical geometry for simplicity , the radiation pressure is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 in terms of the source radius @xmath10 and radiation flux @xmath29 .",
    "thus , since all the balance equations are to first order linear in @xmath29 , it is anticipated that the pressure and energy equilibria of the system point to a unique value of @xmath1 .",
    "we explore this possibility in the next section .",
    "let us first suppose that the x - ray source is a sphere with thomson optical depth @xmath1 , and that the energy is supplied radially by magnetohydrodynamic waves .",
    "the waves carry an energy density @xmath30 and propagate with velocity @xmath31 . for definitiveness , we assume that these are alfvn waves , in which case the momentum flux that enters the x - ray source is @xmath32 .",
    "the magnetic energy of the alfvn waves is in equipartition with the oscillating part of the particle energy density , and so we can estimate the gas pressure as being of the same order as the ram pressure of the oscillating part of the magnetic field , i.e. @xmath32 . finally , we assume that all of the wave energy and momentum are absorbed by the source",
    ".    the energy equilibrium for the ar is then given by @xmath33 whereas in pressure equilibrium @xmath34 dividing the latter equation by the former , one obtains for the equilibrium thomson optical depth : @xmath35 this value does not depend on luminosity , but it does of course depend on the geometry and @xmath31 .",
    "nayakshin & melia ( 1997a ) show that the alfvn velocity is close to @xmath0 for typical conditions in an accretion disk if its luminosity is a sizable fraction of the eddington luminosity and the magnetic field strength in the ar is comparable to the disk thermal energy density .",
    "suppose now that the geometry is not perfectly spherically symmetric , and that instead the alfvn waves can enter the x - ray source through an area @xmath36 , but the radiation leaves through an area @xmath37 , which is plausibly just the total area of the ar .",
    "this situation may occur if part of the x - ray source is confined by other than the alfvn wave ram pressure , e.g. , by the underlying ( non - dynamic ) large - scale magnetic field ( see below ) . in this case , since the energy balance is now @xmath38 , the equilibrium @xmath1 is changed to @xmath39    to understand the scale represented by the bracketed quantities in this equation , let us consider the physical conditions that are likely to be attained during a short - lived and very energetic magnetic flare above the standard @xmath5-disk .",
    "the magnetic field energy density is a fraction of the underlying disk energy density and the typical size @xmath40 of the flare is expected to be of the order of the disk scale height ( galeev et al .",
    "1979 ; haardt et al .",
    "1994 ; nayakshin & melia 1997a ) .",
    "now , the confinement of the plasma inside the flare , and the observed condition @xmath14 , require that @xmath41 .",
    "since the magnetic stress is much larger than any other stress , the magnetic flux tube adjusts to be in a stress - free vacuum configuration .",
    "the tube is thick ( meaning that its cross sectional radius is of the order of its length ) , since the pressure in the disk s atmosphere is insufficient to balance the tube s magnetic field pressure .",
    "this is due to the fact that the magnetic field is presumably anchored in the disk s midplane , where the pressure is much greater than the atmospheric pressure .",
    "the magnetic waves propagate upwards along the magnetic flux tube , while radiation pressure from the ar is pushing the gas along the magnetic lines , i.e. , downwards to the disk .",
    "this downward direction of the radiation pressure arises naturally in a two - phase model ( unlike the situation within the accretion disk ) since here most of the energy is released above the disk s atmosphere ( see also nayakshin & melia 1997b )    with this in mind , we may now describe heuristically how the magnetic flare develops and how pressure equilibrium is established . as is well known ( parker 1979 ; galeev et al .",
    "1979 ) , magnetic flux tubes are buoyant in a stratified atmosphere , and so they rise to the surface of the accretion disk .",
    "as the tube is rising , the particles slide along the magnetic field lines downward to the disk in response to gravity .",
    "the magnetic flux tube becomes more and more particle - free , @xmath31 is increasing , and so the conditions become more and more favorable for the dissipation of magnetic field energy . if magnetohydrodynamic waves are generated and propagate up to the top of the flux tube , and if the conditions there for effective reconnection are satisfied , the different ( incoherent ) waves reconnect and thus produce highly energetic particles .",
    "the particles in turn produce x - radiation by up - scattering the uv radiation from the disk .",
    "since the radiation pressure @xmath42 is very much smaller than the stress in the underlying magnetic flux tube , we may neglect the sideways expansion of the flux tube .",
    "we need to consider the pressure equilibrium along the magnetic field lines , however , since the plasma can in principle move freely in that direction .",
    "the balance of radiation pressure with the magnetic ram pressure then sustains the ar optical depth as discussed above .",
    "since the flux tube is geometrically thick , the corresponding ratio @xmath43 is probably of order @xmath44 one to a few , and with @xmath45 , we therefore expect @xmath46 the lowest values of the equilibrium @xmath1 can be reached due to the fact that @xmath47 in this equation is not necessarily the total area of the source , because some of the x - ray flux can be reflected by the underlying disk and re - enter the ar",
    ". some of this re - entering flux can be parallel to the incoming alfvn energy flux , and thus the effective @xmath47 is smaller than the full geometrical area of the source .",
    "furthermore , we have assumed a one - temperature gas , and have neglected the gas pressure in our calculation .",
    "it is possible that the protons are much hotter than the electrons , and that they account for a sizable fraction of the total pressure in the ar , which then leads to a reduction in the value of the equilibrium @xmath1 as compared to equation ( 5 ) .    in the analysis developed here ,",
    "there is nothing specific to alfvn waves .",
    "we could have instead invoked the influx of energy by other waves or even energetic particles accelerated by a magnetic reconnection process .",
    "all that matters is that they have a well - defined relationship between their momentum and energy densities , and that their propagation speed is close to @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , there may occur a different physical setting where the mechanism for the pressure equilibrium described here can be at work .",
    "it seems unavoidable that magnetic fields are involved , and that they therefore provide some of the confinement , e.g. , in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic field lines .",
    "we encourage future work on the range of possible geometries for the ars .",
    "zdziarski et al . ( 1996 ) produced a fit of the average _",
    "ginga_/osse spectrum of seyfert 1 galaxies assuming that the active regions form hemispheres above the disk .",
    "they found that the radial optical depth of the hemispheres is @xmath2 . here",
    ", we will examine whether the seyfert spectrum can be due to a combination of spectral components from flares with different @xmath1 , but the same @xmath17-parameter ( set arbitrarily at @xmath48 ) .",
    "the latter assumption is introduced to ensure that the x - ray spectral index does not vary considerably from flare to flare .",
    "a constant @xmath17-parameter is a natural consequence of the fixed geometry of the flare , in the sense that the cooling of the plasma is fixed by how much of the x - ray flux re - enters the emitting region after it is reflected from the disk ( see haardt & maraschi 1991 ) .    as an illustration of the method ,",
    "we first compute the spectrum from flares with a range of thomson optical depths assuming that they all have the same luminosity .",
    "we then convolve these spectra with a gaussian probability distribution that a flare occurs with @xmath1 .",
    "the composite spectrum @xmath49 ( in energy / sec / kev ) is @xmath50 f(e , \\tau_t)\\,{\\rm , } \\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the spectrum from a single flare with @xmath1 .",
    "we take @xmath52 and adopt several values of @xmath53 to represent the possible spread in @xmath1 between different flares .",
    "the individual spectra are computed assuming a slab geometry using an eddington frequency - dependent approximation for the radiative transfer , using both the isotropic and first moments of the exact klein - nishina cross section ( nagirner & poutanen 1994 ) .",
    "although this geometry is clearly different from that of a realistic flare , our point here is to test the possibility of co - adding spectra with different @xmath1 , in order to see what range in @xmath1 may be permitted by current observations .",
    "we expect that a more accurate calculation with the correct geometry will yield qualitatively similar limits on @xmath1 , though the exact values should be inferred using a @xmath54 fit to the data .",
    "figure 1 shows the results of our calculation for @xmath52 and two values of @xmath55 : @xmath56 and @xmath57 . the spectrum from a single flare ( solid curve ) with @xmath58 is also shown for comparison .",
    "it can be seen that the plot for @xmath59 is hardly distinguishable from that for @xmath58 .",
    "moreover , these curves differ the most above @xmath60 kev , where the osse data typically have error bars larger than this difference ( see , e.g. , fig . 1 in zdziarski et al .",
    "on the basis of this simple test , we would expect that seyfert spectra may be comprised of contributions from many ars encompassing a range ( @xmath61 ) of @xmath1 .",
    "we note , however , that a broader range in @xmath1 is unlikely because of the considerable flattening to the spectrum for @xmath62 .",
    "the conclusion that @xmath1 is allowed to vary within the range of @xmath61 is very important for the magnetic flare model , since it is otherwise difficult to see how different flares could produce exactly the same @xmath1 . it may also happen that a flare evolves through many phases and that its thomson optical depth therefore varies with time .",
    "however , these calculations demonstrate that as long as that variation is restricted to the range @xmath63 , the resulting spectrum is consistent with the observations .",
    "this is not to say that flares with @xmath1 greatly in excess of @xmath25 are not permitted . according to equation ( 5 )",
    ", a large optical depth probably corresponds to a flare with @xmath64 .",
    "the magnetic field is therefore probably smaller and the energy is transported with a smaller @xmath31 .",
    "that is , magnetic flares with large @xmath1 may be significantly dimmer than the more energetic ones with @xmath2 , and so they do not contribute noticeably to the observed seyfert spectrum .",
    "we have considered the consequences of imposing a pressure equilibrium on the active regions of seyfert galaxies , in addition to the more often studied energy equilibrium , under the assumption that the emission arises within energetic magnetic flares above the surface of a cold disk .",
    "we showed that if the energy is supplied to the x - radiating plasma by the influx of some energy source with a group velocity @xmath65 , then @xmath1 probably falls within the range @xmath66 .",
    "the current x - ray/@xmath3-ray observations are consistent with this range of thomson optical depths .",
    "we conclude that magnetic flares on the surface of the cold disk remain a viable explanation for the spectra observed in seyfert galaxies .",
    "alternative explanations , based on a gravitational confinement of the ars , appear to be incapable of accounting for the observed ` universality ' in the value of @xmath1 .",
    "this work was partially supported by nasa grant nag 5 - 3075 .",
