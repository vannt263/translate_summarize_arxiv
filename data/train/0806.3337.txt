    "this large particle fluence causes damage to silicon pixel sensors , most dominantly by : ( a ) the trapping of moving charges which reduces the signal , ( b ) an increase in the negative space charge concentration n@xmath8 of the depleted silicon bulk which needs a larger external bias voltage to reach full depletion , and ( c ) an increase of leakage currents due to new energy states inside the band gap .",

    "note that in fig  [ charge - losses](b ) the _ misses _ are placed in the first bin and entries at and even somewhat below the nominal threshold of 3000 e@xmath12 are possible due to the non - linearity of the tot calibration at small charges .",

    "part of this is due to the beam s @xmath231@xmath5 inclination to the dut plane , resulting in a 4@xmath1 m space displacement over the depth , but also indicates that the efficiency inside the column is not a step function .",

    "the width of the landau distribution now broadens by about 20@xmath16 and shows the lowest detected charge at about 5ke . while this is beneficial for track detection at collider detectors where tracks always impinge the detector under an angle , the landau broadening with entries as low as 5ke does not constitute a comfortable distance to the threshold , in particular when",

    "the digital resolutions of pixel pitch divided by @xmath25 in both directions , i.e. 14.4@xmath1 m and 114.5@xmath1 m are smeared by a gaussian spread in the order of 5@xmath1 m in y and 6@xmath1 m in x , which is attributed to the resolution of the track extrapolation , the detector noise ( @xmath17380 e@xmath12 ) and the charge sharing behavior of the pixel cells .",
