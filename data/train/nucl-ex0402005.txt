    "large transfers of energy are required in order to initiate fragment emissions from excited heavy nuclei .",
    "the phase space for the socalled cracking mode , i.e. the disintegration into several fragments , assumes its maximum for excitation energies of the order of 1 gev for a @xmath6u nucleus @xcite , and the threshold for fragmentation is expected near 3 mev per nucleon @xcite .",
    "the observation of a rise and subsequent fall of the fragment multiplicities @xcite in the decay of spectator residues produced at relativistic bombarding energies has demonstrated that energies of this magnitude , and even exceeding it , can be reached @xcite .    in these reactions at high energy , the excitation of @xmath7 isobars represents an important mechanism for the transfer of energy from the relative motion of the colliding nuclei into other degrees of freedom .",
    "the strength of pion production with pion - to - participant ratios of up to 10% at incident energies around 1 gev per nucleon gives evidence for it @xcite .",
    "pion production , at these energies , proceeds predominantly via two - step processes , with the excitation of a @xmath7 resonance in a hard nucleon - nucleon collision being the first step .",
    "the excitation of @xmath7 isobars is considered as important also for the heating of the spectator residues via reabsorption or multiple scattering of the @xmath7 or pion @xcite . as an illustration",
    ", the excitation energy of projectile spectators in @xmath3au + @xmath2c collisions at 1 gev per nucleon , as predicted by the isabel intranuclear - cascade model , will be reduced by almost 20% if the @xmath7 channels are artificially suppressed in the calculations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , data obtained with pion projectiles show that their rest energy is as effective in transferring excitation energy to the target as the same amount of kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "direct experimental evidence for the mechanisms responsible for the heating of the produced spectator systems is difficult to obtain because of the high degree of equilibration that is apparent in their decay @xcite . besides global parameters , such as the spectator mass and excitation energy , little measurable traces of the violent initial reaction stages have been found in the decay patterns .",
    "exceptions exist as , e.g. , the sidewards enhancement of the fragment emission in proton induced collisions with @xmath8 10 gev @xcite , which has been attributed to the kinematics of the primary nucleon - nucleon scatterings @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we analyze another signature which depends on the number and the character of the nucleon - nucleon interactions during the initial cascading process .",
    "we study the correlations of the multiplicities of charged pions and of energetic protons with the multiplicities of intermediate - mass fragments in reactions of @xmath2c + @xmath3au at incident energies from 300 to 1800 mev per nucleon .",
    "the indra multidetector @xcite has been used , and the possibility to detect and identify low - energy @xmath0 ( @xmath1 35 mev ) and high - energy protons ( @xmath4 150 mev ) with the si - si(li)-csi(tl ) calibration telescopes , in addition to the nearly 4@xmath9 solid - angle coverage for light charged particles and nuclear fragments , has been exploited .",
    "pion - fragment and proton - fragment correlation functions were constructed from the measured singles and coincidence yields .    the detected pions and protons indicate the occurrence of hard primary collisions but , at the same time , carry away major amounts of energy .",
    "pions and , in particular , the low - energy pions considered here are believed to be emitted late , near the end of the primary reaction phase @xcite .",
    "the absorption effect of the spectators is evident in the dependence of the relative pion rates on the mass of the colliding nuclei @xcite .",
    "therefore , in principle , both positive or negative correlations may be expected and are indeed observed or , at least , weakly indicated . as a main result of this work we find , however , that the deposited energy is equally spread over the degrees of freedom of the decaying spectator system , consistent with the equilibrium assumption made in statistical multifragmentation scenarios .",
    "calculations performed with hybrid models , the lige nucleus - nucleus intranuclear cascade model @xcite with percolation stage @xcite and the dubna intranuclear cascade @xcite , both coupled to the statistical multifragmentation model @xcite , are in good agreement with the experimental results .",
    "the experimental data were obtained as part of the indra experimental program carried out at the gsi darmstadt which encompassed the investigations of the symmetric collision systems @xmath3au + @xmath3au @xcite and xe + sn @xcite at intermediate energies and of the asymmetric systems @xmath2c + @xmath3au and @xmath2c + sn at relativistic bombarding energies .",
    "beams of @xmath2c projectiles with incident energies 300 , 600 , 1000 and 1800 mev per nucleon provided by the heavy - ion synchrotron sis were directed onto @xmath3au targets with areal densities of 2.0 or 2.8 mg/@xmath10 , mounted in the center of the indra detection system .",
    "annular veto detectors upstream and data sets measured with the target being removed were employed in order to identify the interactions of the beam halo with the detectors and the mounting structures .",
    "the beam halo was negligible at 300 mev per nucleon but caused significant trigger rates at the highest incident energies , including events not accompanied by a signal from one of the halo detectors which had outer diameters up to 10 cm .",
    "corrections for this latter component were obtained from the no - target runs , normalized with respect to the number of registered halo events .",
    "the indra detector telescopes are arranged in 17 azimuthally symmetric rings . of these ,",
    "the 8 more backward rings , covering the range of polar angles @xmath11 and consisting of ionization chambers followed by csi(tl ) scintillators , are each equipped with a calibration telescope .",
    "these telescopes consist of pairs of a 80-@xmath12 m si detector and a 2-mm si(li ) detector which are mounted between the ionization chamber and the csi(tl ) crystal of one of the modules of a ring @xcite .",
    "they subtend a small solid angle @xmath13 = 13.2 msr per telescope but provide high resolution for the identification of charged particles .",
    "the calibration of the 80-@xmath12 m si detectors has been obtained with @xmath14-particles from standard mixed - nuclide sources and from @xmath15pb sources providing the 6.1 mev and 8.8 mev lines from the @xmath15pb daughter decay .",
    "the calibration coefficients of the subsequent detectors were then adjusted so as to obtain an optimum reproduction of the locations of identified particles in the measured @xmath16 maps .",
    "for this procedure , the energy loss and range tables of ref .",
    "@xcite were used .",

    "the branch of pions punching through the csi(tl ) detector contains charged pions of either polarity .",
    "it merges with the branch of punch - through protons and , therefore , can only be identified at fairly backward angles where the yields of fast protons are sufficiently weak . in the analysis , regions containing stopped @xmath0 and fast protons were selected that excluded cross - contaminations . for ring 15 ( @xmath18 ) , this is illustrated in the bottom panel of fig .",

    "these regions extended from @xmath19 6 mev to between 30 and 40 mev of energy deposited in the detectors of which 4 mev were assigned to the produced @xmath17 .",
    "slightly larger energy intervals were chosen at the more backward angles because of the reduced interference from punch - through protons .",
    "the corresponding ranges of kinetic energies are about 2 mev up to 35 mev for @xmath0 and about 150 mev to 300 mev for protons . for the subtraction of the background , caused mainly by reactions in the detector material @xcite , equivalent regions in the neighborhood of the particle branches",
    "were sampled .",
    "the observed total multiplicity of charged particles , @xmath20 , has been chosen as a measure of the violence of the collision which , in first order , is a function of the impact parameter @xmath21 . following the geometrical prescription @xcite ,",
    "five impact - parameter bins were defined , each with a width @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the maximum impact parameter contributing at the trigger condition of at least three registered hits in the indra detection system .",

    "[ fig : mul ] as a function of the impact parameter derived from the total multiplicity of charged particles .",
    "all multiplicities show a general increase with decreasing impact parameter . the pion and proton multiplicities increase monotonically with the bombarding energy , most clearly visible in the central impact - parameter bins .",
    "the energy dependence is different for the fragment multiplicities for which the highest values are reached at 600 and 1000 mev per nucleon .",
    "the maximum is expected for the most central collisions at these energies , according to the impact - parameter dependence observed in the reverse reaction @xmath3au + @xmath2c @xcite .",
    "the measured values of below 2 , however , are only about half the maximum multiplicities observed in the inverse - kinematics experiments which have no thresholds for the detection of projectile fragments @xcite . the main cause for this substantial difference is the effective identification threshold for fragments of about 4 mev per nucleon that was applied in the present analysis , in addition to the effects of incomplete solid - angle coverage ( @xmath19 90% of 4@xmath9 ) and of the finite thickness of the target and the shadowing it causes at angles near @xmath26 .",
    "model calculations with parameters obtained from moving - source descriptions of the fragment emissions confirm that inefficiencies of this magnitude are to be expected for the present case of emission from target spectators which are nearly at rest in the laboratory .",
    "these threshold effects depend sensitively on the small but finite momentum transfer to the decaying system and , thus , may vary with the incident energy .",
    "in addition , at 1800 mev per nucleon and central collisions , the fragment multiplicity may already be past its maximum and in the regime of the fall of multifragment emission toward higher bombarding energies @xcite .",

    "the uncertainties displayed in this figure are those derived from the fluctuations of the background in the vicinity of the pion branches in the identification maps .",
    "these systematic errors are considerably higher at 1000 mev per nucleon because of the higher background level at this bombarding energy ( note that only the statistical errors are given for angle - integrated yields shown in other figures ) .",
    "the angular distributions at the two bombarding energies are very similar , in first order isotropic , with a tendency for a slight rise toward the backward angles .",
    "this emission pattern is consistent with multiple rescattering and absorption processes in the target spectator which is practically at rest in the laboratory .",
    "it is in complete contrast to what an extrapolation of the data for high - energy pions would predict .",

    "more pions and hard nucleon - nucleon scatterings are observed at more central impact parameters .",
    "if the contributions of these processes to the energy transfer to the spectator are completely equilibrated at the time of fragment emission , they will influence both , the total charged particle multiplicity that is used for sorting and the multiplicity of fragments .",

    "the exclusive correlation functions are , generally , much closer to unity , and most of the observed deviations from unity can be related to residual correlated dependences on impact parameter ( @xmath20 ) within the chosen finite intervals . at 1800 mev per nucleon , e.g. , the fragment multiplicity decreases with @xmath20 in the most central collisions but increases at 0.4 @xmath43 0.6 while the pion multiplicity increases monotonically with @xmath20 .",
    "these negative and positive correlations are reflected in the correlation function ( fig .",

    "similarly , the overall tendency towards positive correlations at mid - peripheral impact parameters indicates that here , even within a given bin , the more violent collisions , characterized by a larger number of emitted pions and fast protons , imply also higher energy deposits and consequently more fragments for the produced spectator systems .",

    "the correlations obtained in this case are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : smm ] .",
    "these mean excitation energies are above or below the middle of the bin if the distribution of events is not homogeneous and skewed either on the low or on the high energy side .",

    "the obtained correlations are positive at low excitation energy and gradually disappear as the excitation energy is raised . in the range of low excitation energies close to the threshold for multi - fragment emissions",

    "the calculations suggest that the variations of the deposited excitation energy within the chosen finite intervals of charged - particle multiplicity ( impact parameter ) are sufficient to explain the gross behavior of the measured correlation functions .",
    "this conclusion has been further tested with model calculations solely based on a phenomenological analysis of the experimental multiplicities . for this purpose , smoothed interpolations of the measured fragment , pion and fast - proton multiplicities , as functions of the charged - particle multiplicity @xmath20 , were generated .",

    "the overall trend of the data is rather well reproduced , with the exception of the most peripheral bin ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) .",
    "the anticorrelation for pions in the most central event sample may indicate a weak competition between slow pions and fragments , on a level not larger than 10% .",
    "it may also exist at larger impact parameters where it is not visible in the presence of the residual positive correlation caused by the finite bin widths .",
    "the loss of correlations in very peripheral collisions is not predicted by the calculations .",
    "this narrows the class of possible explanations down to processes not included in the inc model as , e.g. , scattering from correlated structures in the target nucleus @xcite .",
    "the cascade processes produce fast protons with high associated transfers of momentum as a result of multiple scatterings from individual nucleons inside a nucleus .",
    "the excitation energy of the produced residue is proportional to the number of such interactions and , therefore , is expected to be high in the case of energetic protons at backward angles .",
    "the scattering from correlated nucleons ( clusters ) can produce large momentum transfers with relatively low transfer of energy , corresponding to the high effective mass of such processes @xcite .",
    "this direct process , even if relatively rare , may contribute significantly to processes with high momentum transfers in very peripheral collisions ( small multiplicities ) .",
    "taking into account , however , that the multiplicities are extremely small and the systematic effects due to halo events largest in this impact - parameter bin , any such interpretation has to be considered speculative at this time .",
    "the investigated correlations connect the production of particles considered as representative for the primary cascading stage of the reaction with the intermediate - mass fragments emitted in the spectator decay in @xmath2c + @xmath3au reactions at 300 , 600 , 1000 , and 1800 mev per nucleon .",
    "the strong correlations obtained for inclusive data sets reflect the common impact - parameter dependence of the considered multiplicities .",
    "more violent collisions , characterized by a larger number of emitted pions and fast protons , also imply higher energy deposits for the produced spectator systems .",
    "no strong evidence for additional direct correlations has appeared from the exclusive correlations functions , studied in their dependence on the multiplicity of charged particles .",
    "a weak anticorrelation between pions and fragments , limited to a few percent , may be indicated in central collisions .",
    "it is most likely due to a weak competition between these emissions , caused by the about 160 mev of energy that is lost from the system with a slow pion .",
    "this is not observed for the fast protons which carry away equal amounts of energy but , apparently , are emitted earlier .",
    "the situation is less clear for very peripheral collisions for which a tendency toward uncorrelated emissions of intermediate - mass fragments and either slow pions or fast protons is observed , contrary to the model predictions .",
    "the scattering of nucleons from cluster structures has been given as an example for a mechanism associated with high momentum transfers and small energy transfers that is not considered in the models .",
    "overall , the observed multiplicity correlations confirm the equilibrated nature of the produced spectator configurations prior to their decay .",
    "the multiplicity correlations of intermediate - mass fragments with either pions or fast protons are implicitly given by their correlations with the charged - particle multiplicity .",

    "<S> the deduced correlation functions @xmath5 for inclusive event samples reflect the strong correlations evident from the common impact - parameter dependence of the considered multiplicities . for narrow impact - parameter bins ( based on charged - particle multiplicity ) , </S>",
    "<S> the correlation functions are close to unity and do not indicate strong additional correlations . only for pions at high particle multiplicities ( central collisions ) a weak anticorrelation is observed , probably due to a limited competition between these emissions . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the results are consistent with the equilibrium assumption made in statistical multifragmentation scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> predictions obtained with intranuclear cascade models coupled to the statistical multifragmentation model are in good agreement with the experimental data . </S>"
