    "one of the authors @xcite , @xcite recently introduced a new approach to the friedel - anderson impurity .",
    "this approach is based on building from the s - electron spectrum a localized s - state for each spin which behaves as an artificial friedel resonance ( afr ) states .",
    "this permits the construction of a very compact approximate ground state ( see appendix , equ .",
    "( [ hfa0 ] ) ) .",
    "it requires solely the optimization of the two localized afr states and consists of a few slater states ( slater determinants ) .",
    "this solution gives remarkably good results for the ground - state energies and the occupation of the d - states .",
    "the results are of the same quality as numerical calculation by gunnarsson and schoenhammer @xcite who applied the large @xmath7 method to the spin @xmath8 friedel - anderson model and included self - consistently up to @xmath9 basis states .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a similar ansatz to the kondo effect .",
    "the intension is to rederive some of the well known properties of the kondo effect within a rather simple and transparent frame work .",
    "the hope is to extend this rather simple method to more complex problems such as the interaction between kondo impurities .",
    "the kondo ground state which is suggested in this paper is derived from the friedel resonance problem .",
    "below equation ( [ hfa0 ] ) gives the friedel - anderson hamiltonian .",
    "if one removes the coulomb exchange interaction term @xmath10 then one obtains the hamiltonian for the friedel resonance .",
    "this is a single - particle hamiltonian and the @xmath11-electron ground state can be written as a simple product of single electron states which are a hybridization of the d - electrons with the band s - electrons .    due to the s - d - interaction between the s - electrons and the d - impurity",
    "the s - electrons shift their weight towards the d - impurity .",
    "this is more clearly expressed in a different version of the @xmath11-electron ground state of the friedel impurity @xcite .",
    "the system forms from the s - band a state @xmath12 which is localized in the close vicinity of the @xmath13-state .",

    "this solution has the same structure as the mean field solution but it yields a much lower ground - state energy .",
    "it also requires a much larger threshold coulomb exchange energy @xmath37 to form a magnetic moment at the impurity .",
    "the study of the kondo effect taught us that the real ground state of the friedel - anderson impurity is a symmetric state ( often called a singlet state ) .",
    "such a state can be constructed from ( [ psi_ms ] ) by reversing the spins of all electrons and combining the two states .",
