    "the radiative recombination process in superconductor - based led has been investigated by optical measurements , which revealed the enhanced oscillator strength @xcite , high quantum efficiency and radiative recombination time rapidly decreasing with temperature @xcite . in transport measurements , on the other hand ,",
    "the diffusion of superconducting pairs into the active layer was demonstrated by dc and ac josephson effect , and the monitoring sensitivity of the radiative recombination process was found to be several orders higher than that in optical measurements although the cause of this ultrahigh sensitivity has not been elucidated @xcite .",
    "the structure of superconductor - based led with one normal electrode at the p - type semiconductor side and two superconducting electrodes separated by a slit at the n - type semiconductor side can be considered as a superconductor - based three - terminal device .",
    "the superconductor - based three terminal device , such as josephson field effect transistor ( jofet ) @xcite , supercurrent modulation device via normal carrier injection ( including 0-@xmath1 transition ) @xcite , have attracted considerable research interests form the viewpoints of not only superconducting electronics but also fundamental study of superconducting transport itself . especially in the case of superconductor - based leds with narrow slit width treated in this paper , most of the generated photons / photon pairs are absorbed immediately due to the strong light - confinement , and the transport of the device are strongly affected by the radiative recombination process . in this paper , we quantitatively analyze the transport properties of superconductor - based led characterized as a superconductor - based three - terminal device , and discuss the carrier flows and non - equilibrium superconductivity which are caused by the radiative recombination process .",

    "it is found that the el emission of @xmath30.86 ev , which reflects the band structure of p - n junction , is obtained with the intensity roughly proportional to the injected current .",
    "the two nb superconducting electrodes together with the n - ingaas layer between them form a superconductor - semiconductor - superconductor josephson junction structure .",

    ", we succeeded the quantitative explanation of the behavior of josephson junction characteristics ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) by taking into account the depletion layer thickness modulated by the gate voltage ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the critical current ( @xmath19 ) and the normal resistance ( @xmath20 ) can be written as follows in _ dirty _ and _ short _ junctions using the effective mass ( @xmath26 ) and mobility ( @xmath0 ) of carrier @xcite : @xmath27 here , @xmath2 ( 150 nm ) , @xmath28 ( 40 nm ) and @xmath29 are the length , thickness and width of the junction , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the quasiparticle density and superconducting pair density , respectively .",
    "as for the depletion layer thickness at the boundary of heterostructure ( @xmath30 ) , we assumed the standard functional form of @xmath31 . by the fitting shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : icrnnqnp](a ) and the values of carrier density and carrier mobility in the n - ingaas layer estimated from the hall measurement , we obtained @xmath29=1.02 @xmath0 m , @xmath32=360.8 @xmath21 , @xmath33=17.8 nm and @xmath34=0.7 v. the effective width of junction @xmath29 ( 1.02 @xmath0 m ) is significantly smaller than the geometrical width of junction @xmath35 ( 20 @xmath0 m ) , which implies that the supercurrent flows only through narrow paths in the n - ingaas layer . using the interfacial resistance ( @xmath32 ) , we defined the channel resistance ( @xmath36 ) as @xmath37 and investigated the @xmath38 product , which is expected to be independent of junction dimensions ( @xmath2 , @xmath29 and @xmath39 ) and proportional to the ratio of carrier densities ( @xmath40 ) from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : icrn ] ) .",
    "the obtained @xmath38 product took a constant value of 10 @xmath0v in the gate - controlled region , which quantitatively supports our description of the direct modulation of channel cross - sectional area by the gate voltage .",
    "this description can be regarded as a new - type jofet , and we emphasize the difference from the conventional jofet @xcite where the carrier density in semiconductor ( normal conductor ) is modulated by the gate voltage .",
    "the estimated value of superconducting pair density @xmath24 ( 3.4 @xmath6 10@xmath41 @xmath8 ) is comparable to those estimated in other superconductor - based leds @xcite .    when the steady current injection takes place in the current - injected region of @xmath42 0.78 v , both of @xmath19 and @xmath20 decrease .",
    "we note that the magnitude of injected current ( @xmath5 ) is several orders smaller than the modulated superconducting critical current ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "therefore , the mechanism of this ultrahigh monitoring sensitivity is substantially different from those in conventional carrier - injected devices @xcite , and can be considered to reflect the radiative recombination process , which characterizes the superconductor - based leds with strong light - confinement .",
    "in fact , we can not explain the behaviors of josephson junction characteristics ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) in small current injection region of @xmath43 10 na by the increase of effective temperature of quasiparticle - pair system in the n - ingaas active layer because @xmath20 takes constant value in the temperature range less than 160 mk .",
    "if we take into account the fact that the depletion layer does not exist in this region ( @xmath44 ) and reconsider eq .",
    "( [ eqn : icrn ] ) , the carrier density in the n - ingaas active layer ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) are found to be the only variables that can explain the behaviors of @xmath20 and @xmath19 .",
    "figure [ fig : icrnnqnp](b ) shows @xmath23 and @xmath24 estimated from eq . (",
    "[ eqn : icrn ] ) as functions @xmath5 .",
    "first , it is noteworthy that the sum @xmath45 increases with @xmath5 in all current - injected region . considering the charge neutrality condition",
    ", this increase indicates that the energy of conduction band for electrons in the n - ingaas active layer is pulled down with respect to vacuum by the current injection .",
    "this also means that the energy of valence band for holes is pulled up , which is implied by the tendency of saturation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : junction](a ) .",
    "we also note that both @xmath23 and @xmath24 do not show the tendency toward saturation in the limit of @xmath46 , the values of which are indicated by arrows in the left vertical axis of fig .",
    "[ fig : icrnnqnp](b ) .",
    "using the flow diagram of quasiparticles and superconducting pairs schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cycle ] , we discuss the carrier flow in the superconductor - based led and explain the mechanism of the ultrahigh monitoring sensitivity for radiative recombination process . because the total charge conserves in the energy relaxation process in succession to the photon absorption , current with an amount exactly equal to @xmath5 is required to be extracted from the n - ingaas active layer to the nb electrodes in the steady state .",
    "this means that the carriers flow into the conduction band of the n - ingaas layer to compensate the carrier loss caused by the recombination process .",
    "we define @xmath47 and @xmath48 as the current carried by quasiparticles and pairs , and represent the steady state condition as @xmath49 here @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the components of injected hole current ( @xmath5 ) that recombine with quasiparticles and pairs corresponding to their recombination rates .",
    "in addition to the inflow of carriers ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) , the hole current injection causes large disturbance in the quasiparticle - pair system via radiative recombination and immediate absorption of generated photons , and promotes the conversion from pairs to quasiparticles .",
    "if we put the current corresponding to the conversion rate as @xmath52 , the following condition is also required in the steady state : @xmath53 ( we define the positive direction of @xmath52 as the flowing direction from quasiparticle subsystem to pair subsystem taking into account that the carrier charge is negative . )    generally speaking , the conversion rate from quasiparticles to pairs ( @xmath52 ) depends not only on the injected current ( @xmath5 ) but also on the carrier density ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "however , in the small current injection region of @xmath43 10 na , we can assume that the energy relaxation process of absorbed photons dominantly proceeds with the destruction of superconducting pairs and put @xmath54 .",
    "here the proportional constant @xmath55 is approximately equal to the ratio of the photon energy ( @xmath56 0.86 ev ) to the superconducting pairing energy ( @xmath57 1.5 mev in nb ) , i.e. @xmath58 . after solving eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : neutrality ] ) and ( [ eqn : steady ] ) with respect to @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and taking into account that @xmath59 , we obtain @xmath60 that is , in order to compensate the conversion from pairs to quasiparticles inside the n - ingaas active layer , the superconducting pairs flow _ into _ the n - ingaas layer ( @xmath61 ) while the quasiparticles flow _ out of _ ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "( to be accurate , the outflow of quasiparticles is a little larger than the inflow of pairs and the steady state condition is secured including the injected hole current . )",
    "both @xmath63 and @xmath64 are larger than @xmath5 by the factor of @xmath59 , which results in the high sensitivity of josephson characteristics for monitoring the radiative recombination process .",
    "the values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 in steady state are determined as the balance points in the carrier flow . because the superconducting pair potential is sufficiently small ,",
    "the reformation of pairs inside the n - ingaas layer is negligible and the pairs lost in the energy relaxation process are compensated only by the inflow of pairs from nb electrodes ( @xmath48 ) . in the nb superconducting electrodes ,",
    "the discrepancy of chemical potentials in quasiparticle - pair system takes place in order to sustain the reformation rate necessary for the compensation , which also means the nonequilibrium superconductivity in the nb electrodes . due to the large interfacial barriers at nb electrodes ( @xmath32 ) ,",
    "it is difficult to estimate the carrier density in the nb electrodes ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) directly from those in the n - ingaas active layer ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "however , we can say that the sudden decrease of @xmath24 in the region of @xmath43 10 na reflects the decrease of @xmath66 caused by the rate - limiting reformation .",
    "when the injected current is increased ( @xmath18 10 na ) , we can not ignore the recombination process involving quasiparticles in addition to various energy relaxation processes of absorbed photons other than the destruction of superconducting pairs .",
    "moreover , the effective temperature of quasiparticle - pair system in the n - ingaas active layer is increased , which causes not only the damping of the compensation cycle but also the suppression of @xmath19 itself .",
    "these effects result in the gradual decrease of the current amplification factor ( @xmath55 ) , and eventual break down of the flow model described in fig .",
    "[ fig : cycle ] . especially in the region of @xmath18 0.3 @xmath0a , the transport measurements of josephson junction characteristics under the steady current injection become difficult whereas the spectrally - integrated el intensity reaches the sensitivity of our optical measurement system as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample](c ) . the injected current ( @xmath5 ) comparable with the superconducting critical current ( @xmath19 ) causes asymmetric distortion of current - voltage curve which is due to the small difference in the transparency of interfaces at the two nb electrodes .",
    "in conclusion , we characterized superconductor - based led in strong light - confinement regime as a superconductor - based three - terminal device , and quantitatively investigated its transport properties ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) . in the gate - controlled region , we confirmed the realization of new - type jofet performance , where the channel cross - sectional area of the junction is directly modulated by the gate voltage . in the current - injected region ,",
    "the superconducting critical curren of @xmath0a order was found to be modulated by the steady current injection of pa order .",
    "we explained this ultrahigh monitoring sensitivity for radiative recombination process by taking into account the conversion of superconducting pairs to quasiparticles in the energy relaxation of absorbed photons , and discuss the carrier flows together with the nonequilibrium superconductivity , both of which take place for compensating the conversion .",
