    "a subset of protostellar systems exhibit large amplitude variations in disc luminosity that appear to reflect discrete accretion episodes through the inner disc and on to the star @xcite .",
    "the most dramatic known events are those that occur in fu orionis systems @xcite , while in exor systems both the amplitude and duration of accretion bursts are reduced . given the sparsity of historical observations it is possible that all protostars undergo outbursting behaviour ( and that additional classes of very long duration outbursts remain unrecognised ) .",
    "indeed , statistical arguments based on a comparison between the observed integrated luminosity of protostars and their final mass are frequently taken to imply that large - scale variability is ubiquitous .",
    "the reason or reasons why protostellar discs show outbursts has not been definitively established .",
    "one class of models attributes the outbursts to an instability in discs that contain a dead - zone @xcite , which in the simplest ( original ) description is a radial region where the strength of vertically integrated turbulence is suppressed by ohmic damping of the magnetorotational instability ( mri , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . outside the thermally ionized inner disc ,",
    "ohmic damping can potentially reduce the _",
    "maximum _ accretion capacity of the disc near 1  au such that it is unable to match the higher mass accretion rates at larger radii .",
    "this can give rise to a limit cycle , in which the inner disc alternates between a thermally ionized high state and a low state in which mass is accumulating within the dead zone @xcite .",
    "bursts are triggered when the growing surface density exceeds the threshold for gravitational instability @xcite .",
    "this gravo - magneto cycle is distinct from the thermal instability of dwarf nova accretion discs , but can be characterized locally using an identical  s - curve \" formalism @xcite .",
    "a number of one and two - dimensional simulations show that the gravo - magneto cycle can lead to global large - amplitude instabilities of protostellar accretion @xcite .",
    "the leading source of uncertainty in gravo - magneto instability models arises from physics that was not included in the original dead zone calculations ( for reviews , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is strong evidence for the importance of additional non - ideal mhd effects ( ambipolar diffusion and the hall effect ) other than ohmic diffusion @xcite , and substantial indications from local numerical simulations that mass and angular momentum loss can occur on au scales via disc winds @xcite .",
    "furthermore , several of the parameters of the instability remain uncertain .",
    "the temperature at which thermal ionization takes places has been shown to impact the properties of the bursts , in particular the peak accretion rate reached during the burst @xcite .",
    "additionally , whether or not the dead - zone can support residual levels of turbulent transport remains an open question with simulations suggesting a low level of transport may be possible @xcite .",
    "such residual transport in the dead - zone has been shown to have an influence on the outburst properties , and hence the evolution of the disc @xcite .",
    "finally , whether heating from the spiral arms due to the gravitational instability can be considered local and axisymmetric is still an open question @xcite .",
    "these important issues are not , however , our focus here .",
    "rather , our goal is to characterize how radial thermal diffusion affects accretion outbursts within a disc model subject to a local gravo - magneto instability .",
    "thermal diffusion matters because the global evolution of an unstable disc is sensitive not just to the details of local instabilities , but also to the radial coupling between annuli .",
    "energy is transported radially by advection and by diffusive processes ( radiative diffusion , and turbulent transport of heat ) .",
    "the role of thermal diffusion in disc outbursts has been studied in the context of dwarf nova outbursts and low - mass x - ray binaries @xcite , but has received little attention in protostellar discs .",
    "we show that it can substantially affect both the duration of gravo - magneto outbursts , and the range of parameter space over which outbursts occur .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in  2 we describe the general properties of our thermal diffusion model , which includes both radiative and turbulent diffusion terms .",
    "we argue that the latter is most consistently written in terms of the disc s radial entropy ( or ` potential temperature ' ) gradient . in  3 we describe the one - dimensional disc model , which is used in  4 to generate a parameter study of discs with varying mass infall rates and prandtl numbers . in ",
    "5 we present analytic estimates of the relative importance of radiative and turbulent diffusion terms .",
    " 6 contains our conclusions .",
    "in this work we want to investigate the role of radial thermal diffusion in the gravo - magneto limit cycle for protoplanetary discs that contain a dead - zone ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as it has been shown to be important in previous models of accretion disc variability caused by the thermal instability ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "radiative diffusion in the optically thick limit can be included simply using a ` two - stream ' approximation for vertical and radial energy transport due to radiation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "when the disc is geometrically thin or optically thick vertical radiative diffusion will dominate over radial radiative diffusion .",
    "however , there has been little consensus for how to include thermal diffusion due to turbulence , with different forms existing in the literature .",
    "typically the radial ( vertically averaged ) heat flux due to turbulence is included through a term that is proportional to the temperature gradient ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the diffusion constant and @xmath9 is the disc s mid - plane temperature .",
    "however , as discussed by @xcite , in the context of vertical transport , turbulent heat flux is not sensitive to the background temperature gradients , but rather the background entropy gradient .",
    "this arises since gas parcels moving radially due to the turbulence will move along adiabats over a certain length scale ( @xmath10 ) , before exchanging heat with the surroundings .",
    "thus , after the gas parcel has moved a distance @xmath10 the relevant temperature gradient is the one between the gas parcel and the surroundings , which is set by the adiabat along which the gas parcel has moved .",
    "thus , the heat flux will be proportional to the disc s background entropy gradient and the length scale over which the turbulence has moved the gas parcel before it transfers its heat to the surrounding disc .",
    "this implies that the term describing the vertically averaged heat flux due to turbulence is of the form : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the disc s entropy per unit mass , @xmath13 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath14 is the disc s surface density and the uncertainty in the length scale over which turbulent heat transport takes place has been encapsulated in the non - dimensional prandtl number ( @xmath15 ) , which measures the ratio of angular momentum to heat transport . equation  [ eqn : fturb ] is similar to the form used in planetary atmospheres to capture turbulent transport of heat , where the entropy is often characterised in terms of the ` potential temperature ' ( @xmath16 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a form we will adopt in section  [ sec : descp ] .",
    "we note that as is the case for radiative diffusion , the turbulent transport in the vertical direction is likely to exceed the radial transport .",
    "the vertical transport may well impact the evolution of disc instabilities @xcite but here we focus on the radial term .",
    "we show that the radial transport of heat by radiative and turbulent diffusion can have a strong impact on the properties of the accretion bursts .",
    "as discussed above turbulent diffusion of heat in a protoplanetary disc is likely to be sensitive to the radial entropy gradient in the disc , rather than the radial temperature gradient .",
    "thus , in order to derive an evolution equation for the thermal state of the disc we begin with the entropy equation :    @xmath17 where @xmath12 is the specific entropy , @xmath18 is the mass density and @xmath19 - with @xmath20 the keplerian angular velocity - is the heating rate per unit volume due to viscous dissipation . the final term on the rhs represents heat transport due to radiation , where @xmath21 is the radiation flux , which in the diffusion approximation is given by : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the radiation constant , @xmath24 the speed of light and @xmath25 the opacity .",
    "the entropy is given by : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the heat capacity at constant volume and @xmath16 is a thermodynamic quantity that is conserved during an adiabatic process . by analogy with vertical heat transport in planetary atmospheres ,",
    "we call @xmath16 the ` potential temperature ' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and define @xmath16 such that it has units of temperature .",
    "we assume - as we do for temperature - that it can be defined as a 1d property of the disc , that depends only on radius .",
    "the potential temperature is a much easier variable to work with than entropy so we proceed in re - writing equation  [ eqn : entropy ] as : @xmath28      we may introduce an phenomenological term for the turbulent diffusion of potential temperature as : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the diffusive flux of potential temperature due to turbulence . the entropy equation including a turbulent heat flux is then given by : @xmath31 under the assumption of an ideal gas , and neglecting compressional heating due to @xmath32 work which is negligible for the velocities in protoplanetary discs , equation  [ eqn : entropy2 ] can be written in an explicit form for the evolution of the temperature as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the heat capacity at constant pressure . to obtain the 1d disc equation we vertically integrate equation  [ eqn : temp2 ] following @xcite , where the terms of the lhs are vertically averaged in the standard way , with @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mid - plane density of the disc , @xmath38 is the stefan - boltzmann constant",
    ", @xmath39 is the disc s scale height and @xmath40 is the vertical optical depth . finally , we assume there is no vertical turbulent energy flux through the surface of the disc and vertically integrate the radial flux term for the potential temperature following @xcite , such that : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the mid - plane potential temperature , and @xmath43 is the vertically averaged turbulent heat flux . thus the vertically averaged equation for the evolution of the mid - plane temperature , including turbulent heat flux becomes : @xmath44\\nonumber\\\\&&-\\left(\\frac{2h}{\\sigma r { { } c_p}}\\right)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r\\frac{4act_m^3}{\\kappa \\rho_m}\\frac{\\partial t_m}{\\partial r}\\right)\\label{eqn : temp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the net heating rate per unit area , @xmath46 is the ratio of heat capacities .",
    "we have manipulated the energy equation into this form as our 1d viscous evolution code already contains routines to integrate the temperature equation @xcite as well as being similar to those used in other studies @xcite .",
    "this allows for consistency within our numerical method as well as allowing us to easily switch on and off the additional diffusive transport terms of interest . without radiative and turbulent diffusion equation  [ eqn : temp ] is identical to that used by @xcite to study bursts in the dead - zone accretion scenario of protoplanetary discs and similar to those used by @xcite .",
    "ultimately , the turbulent heat transport term will only be important when the disc is out of local thermal equilibrium , i.e. when instabilities arise from the activation or quenching of material in the dead zone which results in accretion bursts .",
    "given we want our choice of potential temperature to be invariant under an adiabatic processes that moves a fluid element in a disc radially we start from the standard adiabatic relation @xmath47 .",
    "thus , replacing @xmath48 and remembering @xmath49 where @xmath20 is the angular velocity of the gas ( taken to be keplerian ) , we find an appropriate form for the mid - plane potential temperature for an accretion disc is : @xmath50 where we note the form of the vertically averaged turbulent heat transport term in equation  [ eqn : temp ] is independent of the chosen scaling for the potential temperature .",
    "to prevent overflow / underflow errors in our numerical model described in section  [ sec : num ] we choose to normalise the surface density and angular velocity to the minimum mass solar nebula values at 1  au .",
    "furthermore , by dimensional arguments coupled with comparisons with the angular momentum flux due to the turbulence we define the vertically averaged potential temperature flux as ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath51 where the most naive expectation would be @xmath52 .",
    "in order to investigate the effect of turbulent heat diffusion on accretion burst that can occur in protoplanetary discs with dead zones we numerical integrate the disc equations using a simple one - layer approach .",
    "thus , following @xcite we integrate the diffusion equation for the surface density for a disc around a solar mass star : @xmath53\\right\\}+\\dot{\\sigma}_{\\rm in}\\label{eqn : gas}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the kinematic viscosity due to the mri and/or self - gravity which we detail in section  [ sec : viscosity ] and @xmath55 is the rate of material falling onto the disc .",

    "the temperature evolution of the disc is given by equation  [ eqn : temp ] where the net heating rate ( @xmath61 ) is given by : @xmath62 for our model we adopt the @xcite opacities .",
    "finally , following @xcite when a region of the disc makes the transition to the layered state , we do not attempt to treat the vertical structure but simply replace the expression for the optical depth by @xmath63 .    in all calculations we assume an idea equation of state with @xmath64 and a mean - molecular weight ( @xmath65 ) of 2.35 as the majority of disc material we are interested in remains molecular and neutral .",
    "we treat the viscosity using an ` alpha ' model such that : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the isothermal sound speed . for mri turbulence",
    "we set @xmath68 and for angular momentum transport due to self - gravity we follow @xcite and set @xmath69 to @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the toomre parameter @xcite given by : @xmath73 the form of @xmath74 is not important and is merely designed to keep @xmath75 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we use a non - uniform radial grid ( uniformly spaced in @xmath76 ) with 200 cells with an inner boundary at @xmath77  au and an outer boundary at @xmath78  au .",
    "the chosen grid has high enough resolution so that the results are converged .. at the inner boundary we apply a zero shear boundary condition for the surface density and a reflection boundary condition for the temperature . at the outer boundary",

    "additionally the gas temperature is not allowed to fall below 10  k at any time during the integration .",
    "material then falls onto the disc at a steady value @xmath81 , where @xmath55 is taken to be a gaussian profile of width 1  au and centred at 10  au , ( outside the location of any dead - zone ) .",
    "we then evolve the system to 5  myrs , over which time either a steady disc profile with an accretion rate profile @xmath82 or a steadily repeating limit cycle is achieved , typically this takes 0.5 - 2  myrs to reach .",

    "the top panel shows a simulation with no radial diffusion .",

    "the third panel shows a simulation with radiative diffusion but no turbulent diffusion and the final panel shows a simulation with both radiative and turbulent diffusion ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : demo ] clearly shows that thermal diffusion has a strong impact on the properties of the gravo - magnetic limit cycle , where thermal diffusion shortens the burst duration significantly from @xmath86 years with no diffusion to @xmath87 years in the case of turbulent diffusion .",
    "figure  [ fig : demo ] also indicates that while radiative diffusion alone decreases the burst duration in does not increase the frequency of bursts significantly , whereas the addition of turbulent diffusion also increases the burst frequency .",
    "finally , we note that with strong turbulent diffusion ( @xmath52 ) it dominates over radiative diffusion , and the simulation with both radiative and turbulent diffusion is almost identical to the the simulation with just turbulent diffusion .",
    "since the mass - accretion rate in protoplanetary discs varies by many orders of magnitude during the evolution of a protoplanetary disc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the prandtl number is an unknown parameter , in the next set of simulations we vary both the infall rate onto the disc from @xmath88  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 and the prandtl number from @xmath89 in a series of simulations where we include both radiative diffusion and turbulent diffusion .",
    "most simulations show the time evolution shown in figure  [ fig : demo ] , where the disc quiescently accretes through the active surface layers above the dead - zone at @xmath90  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 .",
    "the dead - zone is then heated above the activation temperature and the mass - accretion rates increases dramatically , with the star accreting at @xmath91  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5for a short period before the disc returns to quiescence .    in the majority of our calculations",
    "the disc temperature remains above the value expected for a passively heated disc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the region of interest ; justifying our use a purely viscously heated disc . however , we note for the lowest infall rates @xmath92 m@xmath4  yr@xmath5the disc s temperature drops below the @xcite passively heated temperature profile outside @xmath93  au . therefore , in - order to model the full evolution of a disc ( something we do not attempt here ) then heating of the disc due to stellar irradiation will need to be taken into account . since , the aim of this work is purely to analyse the effect of thermal diffusion on gravo - magnetic limit cycle , neglecting stellar irradiation ( for the small range of parameters where it maybe important ) does not affect our results or the inferences we draw from them .",
    "we use the simulations to measure several parameters of interest including the average burst duration , the average time between bursts and the duty cycle ( the percentage of time the disc spends in a burst ) . in figures  [ fig : b_length1 ] , [ fig : b_freq1 ] & [ fig : duty_1 ] we show the burst length , time between bursts and duty - cycle for the set of simulations without radiative diffusion .",
    "these results show that for prandtl numbers less than @xmath94 the limit - cycle properties are significantly altered .",
    "the general trend discussed previously that turbulent diffusion leads to significantly shorter bursts that occur more frequently is seen for the full range of parameters . with prandtl numbers of order unity the burst duration is approximately an order of magnitude shorter - @xmath94 years - compared to simulations with low levels of turbulent diffusion .",
    "additionally the range of accretion rates that are unstable to the limit cycle increases at higher accretion rates , where without turbulent diffusion discs with infall rates @xmath95  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5are stable to bursts ; however , with prandtl numbers of order unity this appears to extend for the full simulated range upto infall rates of @xmath96  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 . while we see the individual burst properties appear to be significantly altered , the duty - cycle is not as greatly changed where in general even with the lowest prandtl numbers it within a factor of two of the value without turbulent diffusion .    in figures  [ fig :",
    "b_freq2 ] , [ fig : b_length2 ] & [ fig : duty_2 ] we show the same information on burst length , frequency and duty - cycle but for the set of simulations that additionally include radiative diffusion .",
    "again these simulations show the same general features as expected from the results discussed above .",
    "thermal diffusion leads to shorter burst durations .",
    "additionally the range of infall rates over which accretion bursts occur is extended to higher accretion rates , with burst presents at accretion rates an order of magnitude higher at @xmath97  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5at high prandtl numbers .",
    "however , it is clear that while radiative diffusion is important if turbulent diffusion is unimportant for prandtl numbers smaller than @xmath98 the similarities between the simulations with and without radiative diffusion indicate that turbulent diffusion dominates the transport of heat over radiative diffusion .    , but for simulations that include radiative diffusion ]    .[fig : b_length2 ]    , but for simulations that include radiative diffusion . ]    , but for simulations that include radiative diffusion . ]    finally , we note at small prandtl numbers @xmath99 and high infall rates @xmath100  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5the properties of the burst are different from the standard burst profile",
    ". the mass - accretion rate as a function time is shown for one such case with an infall rate of @xmath101  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5and @xmath102 in figure  [ fig : fast ] . where the disc does not return to a quiesent level of accretion at a rate of @xmath2  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 , but rather rapidly oscillates between an accretion rate of @xmath103 and @xmath96  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 .",
    "m@xmath4  yr@xmath5and @xmath102 .",
    "the time has been reset to zero after a steady cycle was achieved . ]",
    "we have shown that radial diffusion of heat by turbulence ( or radiation ) has a significant impact on the length and frequency of accretion burst due to the gravo - magnetic limit cycle arising from dead - zones in protoplanetary discs .",
    "in particular , we find that turbulent diffusion with prandtl numbers @xmath104 significantly shortens the burst duration and increases the burst frequency . with prandtl numbers of order unity",
    "the burst length can be upto an order of magnitude shorter than previously reported values ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our simulations occasionally show the onset of thermal instability during the ` high - state ' ( the variability in the accretion rate during the burst shown in figure  [ fig : demo ] is indicative of this ) , as has been seen in other simulations @xcite .",
    "radial heat diffusion does modify the thermal instability , an effect that has been studied in detail previously @xcite .",
    "one of the clearest results from the simulations is that at @xmath105 turbulent diffusion dominates over radiative diffusion in setting the burst properties .",
    "this in contrast to previous results on the thermal instability which suggested the terms had a similar role for @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "thus , radiative and turbulent diffusion play different roles when there are large temperature or viscosity gradients .",
    "noting , that in thermal equilibrium one can calculate the ` prandtl number ' for radiative diffusion ( @xmath106 ) @xcite  finding @xmath107 in the optically thick limit  it may seem surprising that in the simulations turbulent diffusion dominates over radiative diffusion . in order to investigate this",
    "further we plot the various heating rates during quiescence ( bottom ) and during the burst ( top ) in figure  [ fig : rates ] for the simulation shown in figure  [ fig : demo ] ( bottom panel ) with an infall rate of @xmath108  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5and prandtl number of 1 including radiative diffusion .",
    "we note in all cases heating / cooling due to advection is negligible .",
    "this indicates that turbulent diffusion does indeed dominate the heating / cooling in regions where the disc is out of local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the main difference between the gravo - magnetic burst discussed here and the thermal instability is that in this situation temperature is rather continuous through the front , but we have large changes in the viscosity . whereas in the thermal stability there are larger changes in temperatures across the instability front which also gives rise to large changes in the viscosity .",
    "since the thermal ` diffusivity ' constant in the turbulent transport case is sensitive the viscosity , whereas the thermal ` diffusivity ' constant in the radiative diffusion case is sensitive to temperature , then for large changes in viscosity across the dead - zone and a comparatively continuous temperature distribution the heating rate for turbulent diffusion is going to dominate over the heating rate for radiative diffusion .",
    "whereas , in the case of the thermal instability they are likely to be comparable across the heating front as suggested by previous simulations . finally , we note that since heat transport due to thermal diffusion is only likely to dominate out of thermal equilibrium and the high power of @xmath109 in the radiative diffusion ` diffusivity ' constant means that an analysis assuming thermodynamic equilibrium can only crudely capture the results ; something we discuss further in section  [ sec : pr_est ] .",
    "finally , we note that the 2d simulations of @xcite indicated that when the thermal instability was triggered during an outburst it could lead to vigorous convection .",
    "this process could certainly be affected by the radial transport seen here and further modelling is warranted .",
    "diffusion of heat by turbulence or radiation plays a major role when the disc is out of local thermal equilibrium ( i.e. when viscous heating is not balanced by vertical cooling ) .",
    "this can occur in the dead zone ; prior to the burst , viscous heating is stronger than radiative cooling ( which results in a temperature increase - triggering the burst ) and during the burst , vertical radiative cooling is stronger than viscous heating ( which results in a temperature decrease - shutting off the burst ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : temp_dead ] , we show the temperature ( top ) and potential temperature ( bottom ) structure in the dead - zone region during quiescence ( solid ) and during the burst ( dashed ) .",
    "this indicates that during quiescence thermal diffusion ( turbulent and radiative ) will heat - up the dead - zone region from both sides triggering the burst faster . during the burst , the dead zone region is hotter than the surrounding disc - at the outer edge for temperature ( thus important for radiative diffusion ) and both sides for potential temperature ( thus important for turbulent diffusion ) - thus thermal diffusion will cool the dead - zone region shutting off the burst quicker .",
    "we can gain some insight by calculating the relevant thermal time - scales for different processes .",
    "taking the viscous time - scale to be @xmath110 , then the heating time - scale ( @xmath111 ) due to viscous processes is approximately : @xmath112 whereas the cooling time ( @xmath113 ) can be expressed as : @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 is the temperature of the disc in local thermal equilibrium .",
    "whereas the time - scale for heating / cooling due to diffusion ( @xmath117 , turbulent or radiative ) is given by : @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the length scale over which the diffusive fluxes vary .",
    "figure  [ fig : temp_dead ] indicates at the dead - zone boundaries @xmath120 for the length - scale over which the temperature / potential temperature varies , indicating @xmath121 and that heating / cooling due to diffusive can become dominant . furthermore ,",
    "as discussed above in the case of turbulent diffusion there can be a large viscosity jump across the dead - zone boundary , in this case @xmath122 , explaining why turbulent diffusion can be a dominant heat transport processes for low prandtl numbers @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , the results of our simulations can easily be interpreted . during quiescence",
    "the dead - zone is cooler than the surrounding disc and out of thermal equilibrium ; thermal diffusion heats up the dead - zone region by transporting heat into it , thus , triggering the burst quicker than without thermal diffusion . during the burst",
    "the dead - zone is hotter than the surrounding disc ( particular when considered in terms of potential temperature ) ; thermal diffusion removes heat from the dead - zone shutting off the burst quicker .",
    "as such the burst length and quiescent length is both shortened , resulting in a more rapidly varying limit cycle .",
    "the effect of radial transport through the disc on the burst cycle is shown in figure  [ fig : temp_cycle ] where we plot the temperature profile through the disc at four stages of the burst cycle : just before ( @xmath123  years ) the burst is triggered ( first panel ) ; during the burst ( second panel ) ; just before ( @xmath123  years ) the burst ends ( third panel ) and just after the disc has returned to quiescence ( fourth panel ) .",
    "the solid lines shows a simulation with a prandtl number of @xmath124 and the dashed line shows a simulation with a prandtl number of @xmath125 , both simulations have an infall rate of @xmath108  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 .",
    "we see that during most stages of the burst s evolution the dead - zone region ( @xmath126  au ) is hotter in the simulations with strong radial transport of heat compared to the simulation without strong radial transport of heat . only during the burst",
    "are the temperature profiles very similar , due to the fact that the disc is fully active throughout the dead - zone and close to radiative equilibrium ( negating the influence of radial transport ) .",
    "the fact that the dead - zone region is hotter ( due to radial transport of heat into the dead - zone from the surroundings ) means that it takes a shorter time and less viscous heating ( from less disc material ) to heat the dead - zone above the activation temperature ( 800  k ) and trigger the accretion burst .",
    "the requirement of less heating from viscous dissipation due to heating from radial transport results in the faster burst cycle seen in the simulations with lower prandtl numbers .      since we have indicated that prandtl numbers @xmath127 are important for affecting the properties of the accretion bursts it is useful to estimate what kind of prandtl numbers one might expect in protoplanetary discs . in order to approach this",
    "we need to assume local radiative equilibrium ( i.e. when thermal diffusion is unimportant for disc evolution ) ; however , it should indicate whether the prandtl number is of the order such that it is important or not .",
    "thus , formally defining the prandtl number as the ratio angular momentum transport to heat diffusion in the radial direction ( @xmath128 ) as : @xmath129 we consider a mixing length ( mlt ) approach where heat is transported by eddies of size @xmath10 , velocity @xmath130 and over - turn time @xmath131 .",
    "if the time - scale for a gas parcel in the eddy to come into thermal equilibrium ( due to energy transport by radiation , @xmath132 ) is much longer than the eddy turn - over time at that scale then , such an eddy is able diffuse heat over the scale @xmath10 . alternatively",
    "if @xmath132 is much shorter than the eddy overturn time then the eddy will remain in thermodynamic equilibrium with surroundings and is unable to diffuse heat .",
    "thus in considering the range of possible prandtl numbers one must evaluate @xmath133 and compare it to @xmath131 . for kolmogorov turbulence @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are the time and length at the inertial scale of the turbulence respectively .",
    "one can estimate @xmath132 following a mixing length style argument ( modified from the mlt derivation for convection in stars e.g. - @xcite ) . consider a fluid parcel of size @xmath137 that has been displaced from its original location by an eddy of scale @xmath138 .",
    "then the radiative flux from the fluid parcel - assuming the radiation field is optically thick - is given by : @xmath139 where the subscript @xmath140 indicates the properties of the fluid parcel , rather than the surroundings .",
    "assuming the temperature difference between the fluid parcel and surroundings is @xmath141 and taking @xmath142 then we find : @xmath143 therefore , the thermal energy transferred between the fluid parcel and surroundings in @xmath132 is : @xmath144 equating this to the thermal energy difference between the fluid parcel and surroundings ( @xmath145 ) , one can obtain an expression for @xmath132 in terms of the eddy size @xmath10 : @xmath146 where a is an order unity geometry factor describing the shape of the ` fluid ' parcel and we have adopted the form factor describing the shape of the fluid parcel from @xcite to evaluate equation  [ eqn : t_r_ell ] .    since @xmath147 and @xmath148 then the ratio of the ratio of the eddy overturn time to the time - scale on which the eddy reaches thermodynamic equilibrium scales as @xmath149 .",
    "this scaling means that as one moves to smaller scales in the turbulent cascade the eddies reach radiative equilibrium with their surroundings faster .",
    "this result implies that whatever @xmath132 , heat transport is most likely to be dominated at the inertial scale , since the largest eddies maintain their entropy for longer - by reaching thermodynamic equilibrium with the background slower - and move larger distances .",
    "thus , the ratio of most interest is @xmath150 , where @xmath151 .",
    "mri turbulence suggests that @xmath152 and @xmath153 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , comparing the ratio of thermal time at the inertial scale to inertial time we find : @xmath154 where since @xmath18 , @xmath109 & @xmath25 are slowly varying with radius ( changing on a scale of @xmath155 ) and @xmath156 then to lowest order in @xmath10 we can neglect the difference between the density , temperature and opacity between the fluid parcel and background to calculate @xmath157 .",
    "now assuming local thermal equilibrium the temperature profile for a steady - alpha disc is : @xmath158 and remembering @xmath159 then we can re - write the ratio @xmath150 as : @xmath160 for @xmath64 .",
    "this suggests that the integral scale of mri turbulence is able to move fluid parcels adiabatically through the disc .",
    "allowing for the diffusion of heat .",
    "however , since the eddy returns before the fluid parcel is able to radiate all its extra heat in to the surroundings then the integral scale will not be fully efficient at diffusing heat .",
    "in fact each overturn will be able to approximately transfer the fraction @xmath161 of the heat to the surroundings .",
    "thus , we may write @xmath128 dimensionally as : @xmath162 provided @xmath163 . using the result for mri turbulence that",
    "@xmath164 and @xmath165 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) this suggest that a reasonable estimate of the prandtl number is : @xmath166 indicating that turbulent diffusion of heat is likely to be extremely important in the properties of accretion bursts .",
    "we note we have used a steady disc approximation to evaluate the ratio of @xmath167 ; however , thermal diffusion is most important when the disc out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "therefore , we suspect the prandtl number may not be constant during the evolution .",
    "in particular , just prior to a burst the disc is cooler than one would expect from the steady disc approximation , so @xmath168 would be smaller than our approximation suggests , decreasing the prandtl number and increase the transport of heat due to turbulence . alternatively as the burst comes to an end the steady disc approximation will overestimate the disc temperature and consequence the prandtl number will be larger than our steady disc estimate suggest",
    ". this scenario would result in bursts being trigger quicker and lasting longer than simulations with constant prandtl number indicate . the strong sensitivity of @xmath150 on temperature for fixed surface density ( in the range of a few hundred to thousand k @xmath169 ) results in @xmath170 , indicating that a non - constant prandtl number may have dynamically interesting consequences of the gravo - magnetic limit cycle .",
    "we have investigated the role of thermal diffusion due to turbulence and radiation in the gravo - magnetic limit cycle in protoplanetary discs with a dead - zone using 1d numerical simulations .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    1 .",
    "thermal diffusion strongly affects the time - scale of the limit cycle , where its conclusion decreases the burst length and increases the burst frequency .",
    "2 .   thermal diffusion increases the range of accretion rates over which a limit cycle is obtained rather then steady accretion , with a limit cycle found for the range of infall rates from @xmath171 m@xmath4  yr@xmath5for high prandtl numbers and for small prandtl numbers we found non - steady accretion above @xmath172  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5upto the maximum simulated infall rate of @xmath96  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 .",
    "3 .   for prandtl numbers",
    "@xmath0 we find turbulent diffusion is more important than radiative diffusion .",
    "4 .   for prandtl numbers of unity",
    "the burst length is significantly shorter than previously simulated values with burst lengths @xmath173  years .",
    "the duty - cycle is generally insensitive to the prandtl number accept at low accretion rates ( a few @xmath2  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 ) where turbulent diffusion decreases the duty - cycle .",
    "an order of magnitude analysis suggests that prandtl numbers of order 10 is a reasonable estimate for accretion discs , although it is unlikely to be constant and will depend on the thermodynamic state of the disc .    since we have shown that if turbulent diffusion of heat is strong ( @xmath105 ) then it has important consequences for the properties of accretion bursts due to the gravo - magnetic limit cycle .",
    "this result should motivate further work to estimate the prandtl number for mri turbulence .",
    "our very simple estimates indicate that the prandtl number does indeed lie in the range where turbulent transport of heat is important ; however , our calculation assumed local thermal equilibrium , and as such only numerical simulations that include the relevant physics can properly assess the role of turbulent diffusion of heat in accretion bursts driven in protoplanetary discs that contain dead zones .",
