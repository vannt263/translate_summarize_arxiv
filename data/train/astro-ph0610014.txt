    "population iii stars are formed out of a pristine , metal free gas made in the big bang .",
    "these are the first stars in the universe and most of these stars have likely formed at a redshift of @xmath2 . to collapse and form stars in this metal - free environment , with its cooling dominated by h@xmath3 , clouds must be larger than in metal - rich environs .",
    "current simulations indicate that an initial mass function of population iii stars is expected to be top heavy with a large fraction of the mass above @xmath4 ( larson 1998 ; nakamura & umemura 2001 ; abel , bryan , & norman 2002 ; bromm , coppi , & larson 2002 ; chabrier 2003 ) , though somewhat less massive , but still massive , stars could form in relic hii regions ( oshea et al .",
    "metal free stars also have much weaker ( if winds ) and hence , much less mass loss than current stellar populations ( kudritzki 2002 ) and do not show strong pulsational instabilities that could lead to strong mass loss for initial masses up to 500 - 1000m@xmath5 ( baraffe , heger & woosley 2001 ) .",
    "that is , not only are these stars born massive , but they also keep most of their mass till their late evolution stages , and a large fraction of them form black holes .",
    "there are also calculations that indicate that these stars could have mass loss originating from high rotation ( e.g. , marigo 2001 ) .",
    "the evolution of metal free stars has been investigated by several authors ( e.g. , woosley , heger , & weaver 2002 ; chieffi & limongi 2002 ; umeda & nomoto 2002 ) . for population iii stars ,",
    "the pair instability is important , and it leads to a complete disruption of stars with initial masses between 140 and 260 m@xmath5 ( bond et al . 1984 ; heger & woosley 2002 ) . below this mass range ,",
    "pair instabilities lead to pulsations and some mass loss , while above 260m@xmath5 , the stars collapse directly to form black holes ( fryer , woosley & heger 2001 ) .",
    "population iii stars are a primary source of ionizing photons in the early universe and , if they explode , can very quickly enrichment the interstellar medium with metals .",
    "the traces of this ionization have been measured by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( kogut 2003 ; cen 2003 ; wyithe & loeb 2003a , 2003b ) .    as every",
    "known stellar population contains a significant fraction of binary and multiple stars , it is interesting to ask if it was the case for the population iii stars as well .",
    "the results of numerical simulation show that metal free clouds with significant angular momentum form binaries ( saigo , matsumoto & umemura 2004 ) .",
    "thus it is likely that population iii stars formed in binaries , however , this issue is still a subject of discussion ( see ripamonti & abel 2004 )",
    ". the evolution of population iii binaries has been first addressed by belczynski , bulik & rudak ( 2004 ) , who considered the possibility of forming double black hole binaries as a result of population iii binary evolution .",
    "the coalescences of such binaries may be detectable by gravitational wave detectors such as ligo and virgo ( kulczycki et al .",
    "formation of double black hole binaries from single population iii stars through dynamical interactions and corresponding ligo signal was also considered ( wyithe & loeb 2004 ) .",
    "gamma - ray bursts may be a different observational manifestation of population iii stars .",
    "the observed population of long soft grbs extends to the redshifts above 6 .",
    "grbs from higher redshifts are expected to be detectable by current instruments , and so are their afterglows ( lamb & reichart 2000 ) . the collapsar model ( woosley 1993 ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) seems to match many of the observed qualities of long duration grbs : burst location in star - forming galaxies and/or star - forming regions in galaxies ( fruchter et al .",
    "1999 ; vreeswijk et al .",
    "2001 ) and the concurrent production of supernovae in the grb explosion ( e.g. , galama et al .",
    "moreover , grbs host galaxies tend to be metal poor ( stanek et al .",
    "the main requirements in the collapsar scenario are that _",
    "( i ) _ the star loses its extended envelope , so the relativistic jet can punch through the compact core of a collapsing star on a timescale comparable to a typical timescale of long - soft grb ( fryer , woosley & hartmann 1999 ) , _ ( ii ) _ the star retains , or attains , a significant amount of angular momentum , so that a self - supporting torus may form around a black hole during core collapse .",
    "given the high masses of population iii stars at collapse , one might expect population iii stars to produce a lot of grbs .",
    "however , if population iii stars lose no or only very little mass in stellar winds , they retain their hydrogen envelopes and hence do not satisfy requirement _ ( iii ) _ ; ( see also heger et al .",
    "binary evolution can both help remove the hydrogen envelope ( through stripping in roche lobe overflow ) and spin - up binary components .",
    "the binary scenario for population iii grbs has been considered by lloyd - ronning et al .",
    "( 2002 ) who studied the dependence of grb formation on metallicity and later by bromm & loeb ( 2006 ) who calculated the swift detection rate using a simplified analytical approach to binary evolution .",
    "although lloyd - ronning et al . ( 2002 ) found only mild or no increase in the ratio of grbs to sne for population iii stars , bromm & loeb ( 2006 ) argued that population iii stars may significantly enhance ( in addition to population i / ii progenitors ) the rate of grbs observed at high redshifts .",
    "however , simplifications in both lloyd - ronning et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and bromm & loeb ( 2006 ) evolutionary models ( e.g. , they did not calculate the angular momentum of the collapsing star ) limited the extent at which these calculations could really estimate the grb rate .    in this paper",
    "we investigate evolutionary scenarios leading to population iii collapsars in binary systems focusing on progenitors spin evolution .",
    "we use detailed stellar models for the evolution of population iii stars and follow some basic binary processes important for the angular momentum evolution of potential grb progenitors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  2 we present the evolutionary model of population iii stars ( singles and binaries ) , in  3 we describe the results and population iii grb rates , and  4 contains our conclusions and a summary .",
    "to follow the evolution of population iii single stars we use models from heger & woosley ( 2006 ) for 10 - 100 solar masses , scannapieco et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for more massive stars , and additionally models for lower mass stars ( which extend to late evolutionary stages , i.e. , agb ) and some high mass stars ( @xmath6 ) specifically calculated for this study . the revised model of belczynski et al .",
    "( 2004 ) is used to evolve population iii binaries .",
    "final black hole masses and formation of collapsar grbs are obtained from fryer ( 2006 ) semi - analytic estimates based on numerical simulations .",
    "the single star evolution was followed using the kepler code ( weaver , zimmerman , & woosley 1978 ) , an implicit 1d hydro code .",
    "a set of published models was used ( heger & woosley 2007 ) and additionally some lower mass ( @xmath7 ) and higher mass ( @xmath8 ) models were calculated .",
    "we use an initial primordial composition and assume no mass loss .",
    "the models used here do not include effects of rotation on the evolution of a star ; the initial angular momentum of population iii binaries is not known .",
    "the assumptions for semi - convection are such that the agb - core collapse transition ( off - center neon ignition ) occurs at @xmath9 , and the first noticeable pulsational pair instability sets in just below @xmath10 .",
    "one of the big uncertainties of these models is the question of mixing of carbon , made in the convective core during core helium burning , with the hydrogen envelope ( see , e.g. , heger , woosley , waters 2000 ; marigo et al .",
    "the massive star models used here show only moderate mixing and remain relatively compact . however , study of scannapieco et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who varied assumptions on semi - convection and overshoot mixing , showed that a large range of radii at the end of core helium burning is possible for massive stars ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this constitutes a major uncertainty for population iii stellar models .",
    "the initial stellar radii are taken from the models above and from schaerer ( 2002 ) . by the end of the main sequence evolution , stellar radii increase by a factor @xmath12 and , on the giant branch",
    ", their radii can increase several orders of magnitude .",
    "the expansion of a star is very important since it is this expansion that determines the onset of roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) .",
    "we use models of marigo et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and baraffe et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to obtain star effective temperature and luminosity at the end of its evolution ( maximum radial expansion ) , and calculate corresponding radius for a given initial star mass .",
    "initial , zero - age main sequence ( zams ) , radii and maximum radii for stars of different initial mass are shown in figure  [ radmax ] .",
    "moment of inertia of a star is calculated from @xmath13 where ( dimensionless ) coefficients @xmath14 change with the evolution of star s internal structure and are different for the envelope and the core . for ms stars we use single coefficient @xmath15 ( polytropic model for massive stars ; lai , rasio & shapiro 1993 ) since there is no well defined core / envelope structure yet . for giants we adopt @xmath16 ( detailed giant models of hurley , pols & tout 2000 ) and @xmath17 , and values for @xmath18 are obtained from the detailed models of population iii stars ( given below ) . for exposed helium cores we use @xmath18 for the entire star .",
    "helium core mass is estimated from @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an initial ( zams ) mass of a star in @xmath21 .",
    "helium core radius is taken from : @xmath22    coefficients @xmath18 are taken from heger & woosley ( 2006 ) , and can be approximated by @xmath23    moment of inertia @xmath24 $ ] of the very inner ( @xmath25 ) part of a star core at the h depletion in the core ( end of ms and he core formation ) is estimated from @xmath26 while the final value ( at fe core formation and just prior the collapse ) is estimated from @xmath27 the above formulas describe the results of numerical simulations with an accuracy better than a few percent .",
    "whether or not a given collapsing star produces a supernova explosion is still a matter of intense study , but it has been known for quite some time that if one can neglect mass loss , low mass stars are easier to explode than high mass stars . using his 2-dimensional core - collapse simulations ,",
    "fryer ( 1999 ) argued that low mass stars would form neutron stars in a supernova explosion , but as the mass increased , the explosion would become weaker and the fallback of ejecta would collapse the compact remnant to a black hole .",
    "even more massive stars would not produce a supernova explosion at all .",
    "assuming supernovae are driven by energy stored in the convective region between the surface of the proto - neutron star and the accretion shock , fryer ( 2006a ) developed a semi - analytic means to estimate the explosion energy and final remnant mass of the collapsing star as a function of the stellar structure .",
    "figure  [ mfin ] shows the remnant mass as a function of initial star mass . fitting this semi - analytic estimate , and adding on the evolution of more massive stars , we develop some simple expressions of the fate of a population iii single star : @xmath28 where we adopt @xmath29 for the fraction of the envelope lost by a star due to pulsational pair - instability .",
    "we also adopt @xmath30 , the limiting mass below which we call remnant a neutron star , and over which bhs are formed .",
    "this translates into @xmath31 for a minimum initial mass to form a bh .",
    "stars with mass below @xmath32 lose part of their mass during the core collapse / supernova event . for higher masses ,",
    "the collapse occurs with virtually no mass loss , and the entire pre - supernova star mass ends up in the final remnant .",
    "there are two exceptions for high mass stars . in the range",
    "@xmath33 part of star s mass is removed through pulsational pair - instability and for @xmath34 the entire star is disrupted in pair instability supernova , with no remnant left .",
    "most of the massive stars do not lose much mass in the final evolutionary stages .",
    "however , if mass is lost , either through pulsational pair - instability or during core collapse and subsequent supernova explosion , the binary system may become eccentric .",
    "we assume spherical mass loss with no natal kick .",
    "we verify that the system is bound and then solve the kepler equations for a new orbit .",
    "binary evolution may alter the final remnant mass of a given stellar component . during rlof phases binary components may change their mass .",
    "if a donor star is a main sequence star , we assume that such configuration leads to the component merger and we terminate binary evolution .",
    "if a donor star is a giant , we assume that it looses its entire h - rich envelope in the ensuing rlof .",
    "if a companion star accretes some of the donor material , it may either become rejuvenated ( main sequence donors ) or it simply increases its mass .",
    "rejuvenation is performed with the increase of @xmath20 and recalculation of all star properties . when a giant star increases its mass , only its envelope mass is increased while the core remains unaffected .",
    "the above mass transfer affects final masses of compact objects .",
    "if a star is rejuvenated , we use its new mass to calculate the final remnant mass ( i.e. , in eq .",
    "[ bhfin ] new increased mass is used as @xmath20 ) . in the case of mass loss , we assume that rlof removes the entire h - rich envelope , and then pre - supernova mass is equal to the helium core mass ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the final mass is then equal to either @xmath35 or @xmath36 , whichever number is smaller .",
    "the binary orbit is allowed to change in the rlof phases .",
    "once a star overfills its roche lobe , we check for dynamical stability of ensuing rlof .",
    "if the mass ratio of the donor to the accretor is larger than @xmath37 , we assume evolution into common envelope ( ce ) phase . otherwise , non -",
    "conservative , but dynamically stable , mass transfer ( mt ) is adopted . in both cases",
    ", the donor loses its entire envelope and becomes an exposed helium core .    for the ce phase we use standard energy balance ( webbink 1984 ) and",
    "calculate the change of an orbit using : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the mass of the donor envelope ejected from the binary , @xmath40 is the roche lobe radius of the donor at the onset of rlof , and the indices @xmath41 denote the initial and final values , respectively . in our calculations , we combine @xmath42 ( ce efficiency ) and @xmath43 ( the central concentration of the donor ) into one ce parameter , and we assume that @xmath44 . in the case of the ce phase it is assumed that no accretion on the companion takes place .    during dynamically stable mt episodes , part of the mass lost by the donor ( @xmath45 )",
    "is accreted onto the companion , and the rest is lost from the system with a specific angular momentum equal to @xmath46 ( podsiadlowski , joss & hsu 1992 ) , where @xmath47 denotes the orbital period .",
    "the change of orbit is calculated from @xmath48 where @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 we assume that half of the mass lost from the donor is also lost from the system ( @xmath52 ) with specific angular momentum @xmath53 , while the remaining half is accreted onto the companion .",
    "since the initial rotational velocities of population iii stars are unknown , we use two different assumptions for the initial spins .",
    "all the stars are initialized with rotational velocities @xmath54 where @xmath20 is expressed in @xmath21 , and @xmath55 is the breakup ( keplerian ) velocity at the star equator . in other words",
    "we have a model with fast rotating stars : 30% of the breakup velocity ; and one in which we adopt a distribution of rotational velocities equal to those used in population i stars .",
    "i initial velocities were taken from a fit presented in belczynski et al .",
    "( 2006 ; see  2.3.3 ) , which we extended to higher masses . in figure  [ vel ]",
    "we show our assumptions on the initial velocities .",
    "we note that population iii stars ( if initialized with @xmath56 ) rotate much faster ( @xmath57 ) than population i stars ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "we then follow the evolution of the spin for each binary component .",
    "the spin angular momentum of a star can be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 denote the mass and radius of an entire star , @xmath35 is the he core mass and @xmath61 denotes the envelope mass , while @xmath62 is the core mass .",
    "spin of the entire star is marked with @xmath63 , while for the giants we denote the spin of he core and h envelope with @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "_ stage 1 _  during the main sequence , when no clear core - envelope structure exists , we assume uniform rotation of an entire star .",
    "expansion on the main sequence ( ms ) slows down a star . final angular velocity of a star on terminal ms is @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the angular velocity at zams , and the radius at terminal ms is approximated with @xmath68 .",
    "initial angular velocity of the entire star is thus reduced by a factor @xmath69 .",
    "_ stage 2 _  just after star leaves main sequence , the clear core - envelope structure appears .",
    "initially core and envelope angular velocities are the same , and are obtained from the conservation of spin angular momentum while the star changes from a uniformly rotating ms star to a giant with core and envelope characterized by different moments of inertia @xmath70 and then we set @xmath71 this leads to a mild spin up of the core and envelope by factors of @xmath72 depending on its initial mass .",
    "_ stage 3 _  the rotation of the helium core will likely decouple from the envelope ( end of main sequence / base of giant branch ) .",
    "however , it is not known how effective such decoupling might be . therefore , during giant stage we follow the spins of the core and the envelope separately , allowing for partial core - envelope coupling .",
    "we introduce a simple spin he core ",
    "h envelope coupling to obtain @xmath73 where the indices i , f mark the angular momentum before and after the coupling , respectively . for simplicity we perform coupling in one step at the time just prior core collapse ( end of star evolution ) or prior to envelope loss for donors entering rlof .",
    "the parameter @xmath74 sets the strength of the coupling , and we calculate models with different values : 0.01 ( strong coupling ) , 0.1 ( weak ) , and 1.0 ( none ; core and envelope spins fully decoupled ) . as a result",
    ", he core is spun down , while envelope is spun up .",
    "the spin of a he core after coupling is @xmath75 and it decreases by a factor of @xmath76 depending on the adopted value of @xmath74 .",
    "the new envelope spin ( readily obtained from eq .  [ rot04 ] ) is not allowed to be larger than the new core spin ; i.e. , the core slows down only to the point at which the spins of the core and envelope are equal .",
    "effectively , the final core spin may be in some cases larger than predicted by eq .",
    "[ rot05 ] and is obtained from @xmath77 also , if rotation of the core is the same or slower than that of its envelope , the coupling is not performed .",
    "such situations may occur in close binaries during the synchronization of the star .",
    "_ stage 4 _  late in the evolution , the inner region of the he core condenses as it forms its iron core .",
    "we calculate the change of rotation in the inner @xmath78 conserving its angular momentum , i.e. , @xmath79 where @xmath80 denote moment of inertia of the inner @xmath81 at the time of he core formation , and at the time of iron core formation , respectively .",
    "the inner region of the star compresses ( see a drastic change of the moment of inertia ; eq .  [ eq5]-  [ eq6 ] ) and its angular velocity ( @xmath82 ) increases dramatically over its initial value ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the spin up factors are of the order of @xmath84 for stars with initial masses of @xmath85 , and @xmath86 for masses @xmath87 .",
    "_ stage 5 _   we also perform a partial coupling of the inner @xmath81 and the material surrounding it ( the outer parts of he core ; outside of inner @xmath81 ) just prior to stellar collapse and remnant ( and/or grb ) formation . following from the conservation of spin angular momentum @xmath88",
    "we can obtain the final ( prior the collapse ) spin of the inner @xmath81 @xmath89 where @xmath90 denote angular momentum of he shell and inner @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "we use @xmath91 to set the strength of coupling , and we calculate models with different values : 0.01 ( strong coupling ) , 0.1 ( moderate coupling ) and 1.0 ( no coupling ) , adopted from woosley & heger ( 2006 ; see table 1 for models with magnetic field coupling included and excluded ) . as a result",
    ", the inner parts are spun down by factors @xmath92 .",
    "magnetic torques were suggested as a mechanism responsible for such coupling ( spruit 2002 ) .",
    "note that , for massive stars , the iron core will be rotating faster ( see eq .  [ rot07 ] and eqs .",
    "[ eq5 ] ,  [ eq6 ] ) than its surrounding he shell .",
    "we assume that this is also the case if a star is subject to synchronization in a close binary .",
    "this is justified by the fact that while synchronization may work on a helium core for a prolonged time , once the iron core forms , it almost immediately collapses .",
    "we will relax this assumption in our parameter study .",
    "_ stage 6 _  stages 1 - 5 cover spin evolution of a single star or non - interacting binary component .",

    "the spin evolution of each binary component ends at stage 5 . in the following we describe additional change of star spin due to the effect of tidal interactions .",
    "once a star fills a significant part of its roche lobe we assume that tidal forces are strong enough to circularize the binary orbit and synchronize a given star .",
    "we use the criterion proposed by portegies zwart & verbunt ( 1996 ) to invoke circularization / synchronization @xmath93 where @xmath94 is semi - major axis of a binary orbit , @xmath95 its eccentricity and @xmath96 is a radius of a binary component that is being synchronized .",

    "stars at different evolutionary stages ( ms stars , giants , naked he stars ) are subject to synchronization provided that the condition  [ tid1 ] is fulfilled .",
    "depending on the orbital separation of the system and the spin of the component that is being synchronized , tides may either increase or decrease a star s angular velocity .",
    "we use population synthesis to determine the change of stellar spins due to tidal interactions .",
    "if both the stellar components of the binary collapse to form compact objects ( with or without accompanying grb ) without disrupting the binary , it will form a double compact object binary ; most frequently a double black hole system .",

    "the change of the core angular velocity due ( only ) to the tidal effects is calculated as @xmath233 where @xmath234 denotes the initial ( pre - synchronization ) velocity of he core , and @xmath235 is the post - synchronization velocity .",

    "we have recorded change of the core rotational velocity ( @xmath236 ) for primaries and secondaries .",
    "only @xmath237 primaries , and @xmath238 secondaries are subject to synchronization , as systems are disrupted in sna explosions , binary components merge in rlof events , or some systems are simply too wide to interact",

    ", the core has decoupled from the envelope ; and its spin is much larger than that of an expanding envelope .",
    "generally , once tides become effective , the mean orbital angular velocity is smaller than the core angular velocity , and the subsequent synchronization slows down the stellar core . for cores which are affected by tides during the giant branch , the speed decreases by factors of @xmath239 ( @xmath240 ) .",
    "however , we find a subpopulation of secondary cores with a rather high tidal speed - up factors @xmath241 . in some cases , a naked helium star is subject to synchronization .",

    "such configuration is encountered in the late evolutionary stages of a massive binary .",
    "after the primary has already formed a compact object , the secondary may initiate a common envelope phase , that leads to a drastic orbital tightening . as a result , a short period binary with secondary he star emerges .",

    "is the specific angular momentum high enough to warrant a potential grb .      in figure  [ mzams ] and  [ mf ] we present the initial ( zams ) masses of potential grb progenitors and the bh masses",
    "they form , respectively .",
    "the initial mass distribution spans almost the entire investigated mass range @xmath249 .",
    "however , primaries only over @xmath250 may form bhs ( and only such stars are included as potential grb progenitors ) .",
    "there are no primaries in the initial mass range @xmath251 because such stars become pair instability supernovae . for secondaries",
    "the range is narrower @xmath252 due to rejuvenation , and in particular stars over @xmath253 may gain enough mass ( @xmath254 ; half of the primary envelope ) to be shifted out of pair instability supernovae mass strip .",
    "black holes are found within mass range @xmath255 and @xmath256 for primary and secondary components , respectively .",
    "the low - mass cut reflects our assumption on the minimum bh mass , and the high - mass cut corresponds to he core mass of the most massive star in the simulation ; @xmath257 ( @xmath258 ) for primaries , and @xmath259 ( @xmath260 ) for rejuvenated secondaries .",
    "pair instability supernova prevent the formation of bhs in secondaries within the mass range between @xmath261 and @xmath262 . here , the empty interval is the same for both components .",
    "the stripped primaries ( potential grb progenitors included here ) just outside of pair instability range form bhs with masses 60 ( @xmath263 ) and @xmath262 ( @xmath264 ) .",
    "secondaries with initial masses that fall within pair instability supernova mass range ( @xmath265 ) gain enough mass and are rejuvenated to form bhs as stars with @xmath266 .",
    "the remaining part of the bh mass distribution follows directly from the initial mass function and envelope removal through rlof .",
    "additionally , we separately show these progenitors ( and the corresponding bhs ) that will attain enough specific angular momentum ( @xmath267 ) to produce a grb .",
    "as mentioned before , it is found that only secondaries form such high rotating cores . both distributions for this subpopulation ,",
    "follow closely their counterparts for potential grb progenitors . since only a small fraction of secondaries gain high speeds and high specific angular momenta , the numbers are much smaller for potential progenitors .",
    "the majority of population iii collapsars ( @xmath268 ) are formed from the lower mass end of the population iii stars ( @xmath269 ) , and could be similar to population i and ii collapsars . only a small subset of collapsars ( @xmath270 ) originate from very massive stars ( @xmath271 ) since such massive stars are hard to be accommodated in binaries small enough that the synchronization would provide enough angular momentum to produce a grb .      results of alternative evolutionary models are presented in table  [ tab02 ] . in the following we discuss the effect of various parameters on our results .    if the tides are only allowed to work on the envelope of the extended star ( giants with clear core and envelope structure ) and not on its core ( mod05 ) , the results remain unchanged .",
    "since tides are the only effectively spinning naked he stars in close ( post - ce ) binaries , the tidal interactions prior to that stage do not play an important role in producing grbs .",
    "had we not allowed tidal interactions to be effective for naked he stars , then the situation changes and of course we then do not produce any grbs .",
    "it is seen in a general case in which we do not allow any tidal interactions ( mod02 ) ; no grbs are formed , but almost the same number of potential progenitors is found .",
    "simply the stars are not spinning fast enough ( no tidal spin up ) to satisfy any of specific angular momentum criteria we have imposed .",
    "we have assumed in our modeling that there is no angular momentum accretion in rlof events . that it is most probably not the case as the accreted mass carries its own non - zero angular momentum .",
    "if angular momentum is transferred from one component to the other with mass , it may alter the spin of the components .",
    "we have calculated a model ( mod14 ) in which we have allowed accreting stars to maximally increase their rotational velocities ( to keplerian velocity ) .",
    "this happens during stable rlof ( prolonged phase , mass accretion ) when the evolved primary transfers mass to the main sequence secondary .",
    "main sequence stars are assumed to rotate uniformly , and the entire star is spun up .",
    "however , such a spin up has no effect on the predicted grb formation efficiencies .",
    "this is due to a simple fact that all grb progenitors are subject to tidal synchronization that sets the star speed in later evolutionary stages .",
    "therefore , no matter how much the star was spun up in early evolutionary stages , once it is subject to tidal interactions it will be slowed down to the speed set by the size of its orbit .",
    "we do not follow the corresponding spin down of the donors",
    ". had it was included it would not have altered the grb formation efficiencies , since the grb progenitors originate from fast rotating helium cores that were spun up by synchronization in close binaries after mass transfer episodes were over .",
    "if we impose natal kicks for all compact objects ( mod03 ) , some binaries are disrupted and the grb formation efficiencies ( @xmath272 ) decrease to 60 - 80% of the standard model values .",
    "although we have used quite large kicks drawn from maxwellian distribution with @xmath273 ( hobbs et al 2006 ; the most recent estimate for population i stars ) , there is only a rather small decrease in formation efficiency of grbs .",
    "once we impose kicks many binaries are disrupted in sne explosions .",
    "however , the grb progenitors evolve through one or two rlof episodes and are found on close orbits and therefore are hard to disrupt .",
    "the change of the minimum mass of a population iii star from 10 to @xmath274 ( mod04 ) increases the grb formation efficiencies by factor of @xmath275 .",
    "this is due to the fact that we assume that stars with @xmath276 form nss instead of bhs ( unless these stars accrete mass ) and increasing of initial mass over the bh formation threshold enhances the chances of forming a grb progenitor .",
    "the average stellar mass in the simulation increases to @xmath277 , and it is @xmath278 larger than in the standard model , therefore the grb detection rate remains basically unaffected as the two factors cancel out ( see eq .  [ rone ] ) .",
    "since the binary fraction is the same as in the standard model , the mass fraction @xmath279 does not change either ( @xmath280 for this model ) .",
    "we performed one calculation ( mod13 ) performed using our `` moderate rotator '' prescription for rotation speeds ( see eq .",
    "[ velzams ] ) .",
    "the stars are initialized with speeds that are characteristic of population i stars ( @xmath281 ) .",
    "grb formation efficiencies does not change substantially , since the final spin up for he cores making grb progenitors does not depend on the star initial spin , but rather on the size of the orbit of binary undergoing synchronization .",
    "we also perform a calculation with the alternative imf for population iii stars ( mod12 ) ; both component masses are drawn independently from a power - law distribution with @xmath282 within the same mass range as in the standard model ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "the resulting distribution of mass ratio , defined now as mass ratio of the less massive component to the mass of the more massive component ) , is flatter than in the standard model ( see figure  [ imf ] ) .",
    "the average mass of a star in binary and a single star is now the same and is @xmath283 , and we obtain @xmath284 .",
    "grb formation efficiencies drop by factor of @xmath285 in this model , however due to the lower average star mass in this simulation , the _ swift _ detection rates are not greatly affected ( change by factor of @xmath286 ) .",
    "maximum increase of binary fraction ( to @xmath287 ) may increase the _ swift _ detection rate by factor of @xmath179 ( see eq .  [ etamass ] ) .",
    "however , such a high binary fraction in population iii seems very unlikely due to the fact that primordial gas was much harder to fragment than metal - rich gas of population i and in particular binaries may have not formed at all ( e.g. , ripamonti & abel 2004 ) .",
    "we have also investigated the influence of adopted ce efficiency on our results . with the decreased ce efficiency ( @xmath288 ;",
    "mod10 ) the grb formation efficiencies change by factors @xmath289 , while with the increased ce efficiency ( @xmath290 ; mod11 ) they change by factors @xmath291 .",
    "change of ce efficiency has an important role on the post - ce orbital separation of a binary system .",
    "that in turn plays a crucial role for systems that are grb progenitors ( components need to be close enough for tides to spin up naked he core of the secondary ) .",
    "if post - ce orbit is too wide , he core is not spun up enough to form a grb , and if post - ce orbit is too tight , the binary components merge .",
    "the ce acts as a simple orbital separation filtering , and changing the ce efficiency allows ce to send different pre - ce binaries to the given post - ce separation range .",
    "therefore , as long as there is a wide range of pre - ce separations , change of the ce efficiency will only select different binaries to fall within specific required post - ce orbit range ( required , e.g. , for grb formation ) .",
    "coupling of the he core with h envelope during giant phase is not important for the formation of grbs .",
    "models with strong coupling ( @xmath292 ; mod06 ) as well as with fully decoupled he cores ( @xmath293 ; mod07 ) generate the same numbers of grbs . since the grb progenitors are synchronous at giant stage ( close binaries ) their cores rotate at the same speed as envelopes , and therefore cores does not loose any angular momentum in the process .    in case of a very strong coupling of iron core to the surrounding he shell ( @xmath294 ; mod09 ) the collapsing cores has 10 times less specific angular momentum then in the standard model , and the grb formation efficiencies change : @xmath295 , @xmath296 , @xmath297 ( @xmath183 is unchanged since the similar potential progenitors are formed ) .",
    "still the same population of synchronized secondary helium stars make grb progenitors .",
    "we note the significant increase ( factor @xmath298 ) in @xmath184 , although the efficiency is still relatively small .",
    "if we assume that an iron core is not coupled to the surrounding he shell ( @xmath299 ; mod08 ) then the core does nt lose angular momentum and is spinning fast . the specific angular momentum in this model is presented in figure  [ angm8 ] .",
    "since specific angular momentum is proportional to iron core speed , and the speed is higher by factor of 10 than in standard model , now both primaries and secondaries can produce a grb .",
    "the subpopulation of secondary helium cores that are spun up through tidal interactions and that are the sole grb progenitors in other models may in this evolutionary scenario have specific angular momenta that are too high to produce a grb ( @xmath300 ) .",
    "the grb formation efficiencies are following : @xmath301 , @xmath302 , @xmath303 , @xmath304 .",
    "as compared to standard model , @xmath183 does not change since it includes all potential grb progenitors ( no constraint on specific angular momentum ) , also @xmath186 is not affected too much as it includes only very high angular momentum systems ( synchronized helium stars as in standard model ) , and the additional stars do nt make the cut ( see figure  [ angm8 ] ) . the highest increase ( two orders of magnitude )",
    "is observed for @xmath184 as it encompasses the largest fraction of additional fast spinning cores ( mostly originating from primaries ) , and the moderate increase is found for @xmath185 which is doubled .",
    "note that the subpopulation of stars making grbs in the standard model , does not contribute to @xmath184 nor @xmath185 due to their very high specific angular momentum .",
    "these are the highest grb formation efficiencies that we obtain within our modeling .",
    "although this assumption ( no angular momentum loss from the inner core ) may be contrary to the expectations for single stars ( spruit 2002 ; woosley & heger 2006 ) it may potentially work for some stars in close binaries . for binary components that are subject to strong tidal interactions , that may make the entire star rotate synchronously , the iron core included .",
    "if this is the case , the stars that go through synchronization are not subject to angular momentum transport ( uniform rotation ) and then results of this model should be considered as representative of binary population . with the lack of observational evidence on the effectiveness of tides and also lack of theoretical work for population iii stars ,",
    "we treat this as a major uncertainty of our binary evolutionary model .",
    "population iii stars evolve very quickly so their redshift distribution follows the star formation rate . for simplicity",
    "we assume that population iii stars were formed between redshifts 10 and 30 and that the star formation rate is in this epoch was @xmath305 . for the calculation of the rate this is an optimistic assumption since the actual redshift range for population iii stars is probably smaller . for this choice of redshifts",
    ", we obtain @xmath306 .",
    "the grb formation efficiencies are listed in table  [ tab02 ] and we can use equation  [ rate ] to calculate swift detection rate .",
    "we obtain @xmath307 for standard model calculation , range resulting from the different constrains on specific angular momentum used . even for the model with no angular momentum loss for iron cores , for which we find the highest grb formation efficiency ( @xmath302 ) _",
    "swift _ detection rate goes only up to @xmath308 .",
    "this result has been obtained with rather conservative assumptions .",
    "we have chosen a large binary fraction ( @xmath309 ) for population iii and a rather wide beaming fraction corresponding to the typical beaming half angle of 11 degrees .",
    "we have also chosen a rather large value of the redshift range in which population iii stars are formed .",
    "the star formation rate we have used can not be increased by much as well .",
    "thus we consider our estimate as a very safe upper limit estimate for collapsars from the population iii binaries observable by swift .",
    "we have modeled the evolution of population iii binaries using the most up to date numerical models of such stars . by focusing on binary progenitors that both eject the hydrogen envelope and spin up the core prior to collapse , we estimate the fraction of these systems that produce potential grb progenitors .",
    "we find that the typical scenario to form such a star produces grbs from the star that is , at least initially , less massive .",
    "it was found that significant fraction of stars @xmath310 lose their h - rich envelopes through binary interactions and are massive enough to form bh .",
    "however , only a small fraction of stars @xmath311 have been additionally spun up by tidal interactions to a sufficient specific angular momentum to make a grb . majority ( @xmath268 ) of the collapsing cores that make grbs have relatively low masses and are in the range @xmath312 , and only a very few population iii collapsars are produce from massive cores @xmath313 .",
    "we calculate the expected detection rate of population iii grbs by swift and find that it is very low , @xmath314 for our standard evolutionary model .",
    "even for the most optimistic model , in which we do not allow angular momentum loss from the collapsing core , the rate is rather low @xmath308 .",
    "there are two main reasons for this .",
    "first , the overall potential detection rate from population iii binaries is relatively small .",
    "even if we assume that all stars in population iii binaries make a grb , we would expect only @xmath315 , and this only under optimistic assumptions on binary fraction and grb collimation .",
    "second , it is difficult to spin the stars up through tidal interactions , sufficiently enough to make a grb .",
    "only a small fraction of stars in binaries ( @xmath311 ) are subject to such a strong spin up .",
    "bromm & loeb ( 2006 ) assumed that all the exposed he cores are spun up sufficiently to make a grb .",
    "this assumption led to an overestimate of high redshift grbs .",
    "in contrast , we find that there should be no detectable high redshift grbs from population iii binaries .",
    "this conclusion only weakly depends on a number of evolutionary unknowns .",
    "if , however , high redshift bursts are detected and are identified with population iii stars , then our results argue against this particular collapsar progenitor scenario for such bursts .",
    "one should note that the expected rate of gravitational wave bursts from coalescences of double black hole binaries originating in population iii stars in the advanced ligo is a much more promising way to investigate the properties of population iii binaries ( belczynski et al .",
    "2004 ; kulczycki et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the collapsar scenario requires that the star is stripped of its outer layers in order for the jet to be able to break out . in the above models we only consider stars stripped of hydrogen envelopes , however some scenarios , and some observations , also require the removal of most of the helium envelope . at this stage",
    "the models are not advanced enough to investigate this scenario in detail .",
    "however , we have estimated the number of helium stars that fill the roche lobes and hence may potentially be stripped of their he - rich envelopes .",
    "only a small fraction of stars ( @xmath316 ) in population iii binaries may lose their he - rich envelopes and even if all of them are spun up enough to produce grbs the resulting rate is then only @xmath317 .",
    "one notable difference is that in this case most of the bursts would come from the initially more massive star ( star 1 ) .",
    "further analysis , once better models of population iii stars are available , should allow to investigate this issue .",
    "also , a component merger , a new single star , may be spinning much faster than the original components , and provide enough angular momentum to make grb .",
    "such mergers are encountered in binary evolution during rlof phases .",
    "although we do not follow the evolution of such merger products , their formation rate is also rather small ; only about @xmath318 stars in population iii binaries merge before forming compact remnants , resulting again in a rather small swift detection rate of @xmath319 .",
    "another possibility of forming grb in a binary is a common envelope merger of a giant and a main sequence star ( ivanova et al . in preparation ; podsiadlowski 2006 , grb symposium in london ) .",
    "the inspiralling main sequence star supplies pure hydrogen to the he burning shell of a giant , the resulting flash removes the envelope of a giant .",
    "also the in falling hydrogen - rich material may spin up the helium core of a giant .",
    "although details of the model has not been worked out in case of zero metallicity population iii stars , we have estimated number of potential common envelope configurations .",
    "such common envelope mergers are found more frequently @xmath320 than the grbs formed through tidal spin up ( see table  [ tab02 ] ) but are still not numerous enough to warrant _ swift _ detection ( @xmath321 ) , even if we assume that all such events lead to a grb ( overestimate , since only very specific initial conditions of an inspiral and stellar structure of binary components may lead to a grb ; ivanova , private communication ) .",
    "we do not find enough grb progenitors in population iii binaries to warrant detection with _",
    "swift_. if binaries exist in population iii at all , they may provide potential gravitational radiation signature , through mergers of their end products : massive double black holes ( see e.g. , kulczycki et al .",
    "if grbs are detected , an ideal candidate might be the single star , high - mixing models proposed by yoon & langer ( 2005 ; see also woosley & heger 2006 ) .",
    "although this progenitor is unlikely to be the primary progenitor for grbs at low redshift ( fryer 2006b ) , it could make a considerable contribution to the grb population at high redshift .",
    "if all the stars were single in population iii , and if we have assumed that _ all _ of them produce a grb , we would obtain _ swift _ detection rate of @xmath322 ( see eq .  [ rate ] , with @xmath323 and @xmath324 ) .",
    "however , during about 2 years of _ swift _ observations there was no detection of an extreme redshift ( @xmath325 ) grb .",
    "this , in principle , could put an upper limit on the population iii single star grb model .",
