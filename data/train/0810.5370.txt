    "for stars with surface convection , turbulent dissipation in the convective zone is believed to be the dominant mechanism responsible for the conversion of mechanical energy of tides , stellar oscillations and stellar pulsations to heat .",
    "thus , this is the mechanism believed to determine the rates of tidal synchronization and circularization @xcite , the amplitudes of stellar @xmath0 modes @xcite , and the instability of stars to pulsations @xcite .    the simplest approach to estimating the dissipation efficiency of the turbulent convection is to assume that the turbulence is homogeneous and isotropic and its interaction with external shear is only local . in that case",
    ", we can define an effective viscosity coefficient which will capture the effects due to the turbulent flow .",
    "the question then is how to find the value of this coefficient .",
    "currently two prescriptions , based on the assumption of kolmogorov cascade , exist for estimating this coefficient as a function of the time period of the external shear ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "@xcite proposes that , the effective viscosity should scale linearly with the fraction of a turn eddies manage to complete in half a perturbation period : @xmath2 .",
    "\\label{eq : zahn viscosity}\\ ] ]    on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite , argue that eddies with turnover times bigger than @xmath3 will not contribute to the dissipation .",
    "then kolmogorov scaling predicts : @xmath4\\ ] ]    zahn s more efficient dissipation seems to be in better agreement with observations of tidal circularization times for binaries containing a giant star @xcite , the location of the red edge of the cepheid instability strip @xcite , and even this more efficient prescription might be insufficient to explain the main sequence circularization of binary stars in clusters @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , successfully used the less efficient dissipation to develop a theory for the damping of the solar @xmath0-modes . in this case the more effective dissipation would require dramatic changes in the excitation mechanism in order to explain the observed amplitudes .",
    "finally , @xcite calculated a lowest order expansion of the effective viscosity , which when applied to kolmogorov turbulence predicts a result closer to the less efficient goldreich & nicholson viscosity . while this gives a firmer theoretical foundation for the quadratic prescription it does not help with the observational problem of insufficient dissipation in the case of tides and stellar pulsations .",
    "a possible resolution of this problem is suggested by the fact that the successful applications of the two prescriptions correspond to very different perturbation periods .",
    "the @xcite scaling seems to work well for periods of order days , and the goldreich and collaborators quadratic scaling seems to apply for periods of order minutes .",
    "this distinction is important because , in stars with surface convection , kolmogorov scaling predicts that the eddies with turnover times of several minutes would have typical sizes that are very small compared to the local pressure scale height and any other external length scales . on the other hand turnover times of days",
    "correspond to eddies with typical sizes comparable or larger than the local pressure scale height . in this case",
    "kolmogorov scaling is not expected to apply .",
    "the flow seen in 2d and 3d simulations of stellar convection is very different from a kolmogorov cascade @xcite .",
    "there are two important distinctions .",
    "the first is that the velocity power spectrum is much flatter in the simulations than kolmogorov , and so one expects to find a slower loss of dissipation efficiency with increased frequency of the external shear , assuming that the dissipation is dominated by the resonant eddies , as long as the external shear has a period that corresponds to eddy turnover times too long to fall in the inertial subrange of kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "the second is that the flow is no longer isotropic and hence the effective viscosity should be a tensor , rather than a scalar .    as a first attempt to explore this possibility",
    "@xcite adapted the @xcite perturbative calculation to the @xcite numerical model of stellar convection and found an asymmetric effective viscosity that scaled linearly with the period of the external shear .",
    "however , their perturbative calculation is applicable only as long as the forcing period @xmath1 is small compared to the turnover time of the largest eddies . in particular",
    "the perturbative treatment is not able to provide the maximum value the effective viscosity reaches and the frequency at which it reaches it , which is of great importance in calculating tidal interactions and dissipation of pulsations .    in this article",
    "we use the @xcite spectral anelastic code to perform a direct calculation of the turbulent dissipation in a convective zone , by introducing external shear as an extra body force in the fluid equations .",
    "the goal is to investigate the applicability of effective viscosity as an approximation to the actual turbulent dissipation , and to derive directly an effective viscosity prescription and compare it against the @xcite formalism .",
    "the details of the numerical simulation and the equations evolved are presented in @xcite .",
    "we are simulating a rectangular box with impenetrable , constant temperature top and bottom boundaries ( the @xmath5 velocity vanishes and the temperature is held at some constant value at the top and bottom walls of the box ) using the anelastic approximation .    the background state , and the parameters with which all the runs presented in this paper were computed , are the same as the parameters used for all convectively unstable tests of section 4.1 of @xcite . for convenience",
    "we remind them here :       the limited spatial resolution of our box does not allow us to reliably simulate the case of @xmath6 . in that regime , the assumptions for kolmogorov turbulence hold and the effective viscosity should scale quadratically with period @xcite .    we compare the above directly calculated values to a perturbative estimate of the effective viscosity , which also predicts linear period dependence with the same slope , but with @xmath7 for all viscosity components .    the viscosity of equations [ eq : nu_xz_final ] and [ eq : nu_xy_final ] is closer to the @xcite prescription including the saturation period .",
    "however , the fact that we see the dissipation disappearing sharply at short periods suggests that the zahn picture in which the dissipation is dominated by the largest eddies present is not the correct one .",
    "if this were the case the linear scaling seen at long periods should continue to hold for arbitrarily high frequencies .",
    "instead our results suggest that it is the eddies with turnover times cloes to the external forcing period that cause most of the dissipation , and the observed linear scaling is due to the shallower than kolmogorov time spectrum of the convective velocities . as a result",
    ", we expect the linear loss of efficiency to apply only in a limited range and for shorter periods faster loss of efficiency should occur",
    ". this might be the resolution of the apparent discrepancy between the dissipation necessary to explain tidal circularization and the red edge of the cepheid instability strip on one hand and the observed amplitudes of the solar @xmath0-modes on the other . for small periods",
    "( of order minutes ) the kolmogorov scaling of turbulence holds and a quadratic decrease in the effective viscosity is appropriate . for long periods ( of order days ) the assumptions necessary for kolmogorov cascade",
    "are not satisfied and the effective viscosity is found to scale linearly with period ."
