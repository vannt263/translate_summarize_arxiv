    "in many experiments in physics and chemistry , an ionic material with slablike geometry is sandwiched between two metallic parallel plates with electric potential difference .",
    "this situation occurs in solid oxide fuel cells and batteries where an electrolyte lies between two electrodes as well as dielectric materials in capacitors .",
    "atomistic simulations are of great importance to improve the understanding of the atomic scale mechanisms and processes in ionic materials used as an electrolyte in fuel cells or dielectric in capacitors .",
    "electrostatic interaction in ionic materials dominates among interatomic forces and its proper calculation is thus very important for the simulations of such materials . in atomistic simulation of electrolytes ,",
    "the two electrodes are usually neglected since computational methods known for coulombic interaction do not account for the effects of the electrodes .",
    "materials with slablike geometries are modelled with periodic boundary conditions for lateral directions and free boundary condition for the perpendicular direction .",
    "this type of boundary conditions is typically called surface , slab , or 2d+h boundary conditions . the electrostatic interaction between charged particles and the two electrodes",
    "are typically modelled by an external electric field in the nonperiodic direction .",
    "such a modelling does not provide information on various physical properties such as the charge density induced at the electrodes and the microscopic response of particles in the vicinity of the interface between the electrolyte and the electrodes .",
    "in addition , the effect of a uniform external electric field may be different from the electrostatic interaction in the electrolyte with the presence of the two electrodes , in particular when the electrolyte is ultrathin .",
    "in addition , there may be nonlinear phenomena that can not be investigated by using a uniform electric field .    due to the long ranged nature of the coulomb potential , direct summation for free boundary conditions scales as @xmath2 , where @xmath1 is the number of particles in the simulation box .",
    "several methods  @xcite have been developed for the calculation of coulomb interaction with free boundary conditions that have complexity of @xmath0 while preserving the original boundary conditions .",
    "for periodic boundary conditions , particles in the periodic images must be considered as well .",
    "the ewald method  @xcite for fully periodic boundary conditions solves the problem due to the inclusion of particles in periodic images in the calculations , however , it has time complexity of @xmath2 and by choosing optimal parameters it can be improved to @xmath3 scaling .",
    "the scaling can be enhanced further to an @xmath0 if fast fourier transformation is employed .",
    "several methods are developed for coulombic interaction with slab boundary conditions .",
    "some of these methods are in the spirit of ewald methods  @xcite and the others  @xcite are based on the mmm  @xcite method .",
    "the mmm method for slab boundary conditions is called mmm2d  @xcite and it has the advantage that it preserves the original boundary conditions , however , its complexity is @xmath4 .",
    "the standard implementation of the ewald method based on fast fourier transformation have been used in atomistic simulation of charged particles in slablike geometries .",
    "the major problem of the standard ewald method for slab boundary conditions is due to the assumption that boundary conditions in all directions are considered as periodic .",
    "therefore , in the nonperiodic direction an empty space must be used to decouple the interaction between the particles in the simulation box and those of periodic images .",
    "this approach not only makes the method inefficient but also the artificial interaction does not vanish fast enough with the size of the empty space if the system has dipole moment .",
    "methods such particle particle particle mesh with layer correction  @xcite ( p3mlc ) have been proposed to correct for dipole - dipole interaction between periodic images . in 2007 ,",
    "a new method was introduced by ghasemi and coworkers that was called particle particle particle density ( p@xmath5d ) method  @xcite .",
    "the p@xmath5d method is in the spirit of ewald method and it employs plane waves for the periodic directions and finite element for the nonperiodic direction to expand the potential function and the charge density . the p@xmath5d method is the only method which not only preserves the original slab boundary conditions but also it has desirable scaling of @xmath0 .    none of the aforementioned methods in their original form can be directly employed for the electrostatic calculation of charged particles confined by metallic boundaries . in recent years , two methods were developed by holm  @xcite and coworkers that compute electrostatic interaction of charged particles confined between two dielectric materials . the image charge mmm2d",
    "@xcite(icmmm2d ) is based on the method of image charge in electrostatics and the mmm2d method . even though it was originally developed for coulombic interaction of charged particles inside a dielectric material trapped between two dielectric materials ,",
    "it can be applied to electrostatic interaction of charged particles confined by metallic plates . in icmmm2d ,",
    "the number of image charge particles strongly depends on the difference between dielectric constants of the electrolyte and those of surrounding materials .",
    "the computational cost of including image charge particles scales linearly with the number of particles in the simulation box .",
    "however , for large number of particles the original scaling of mmm2d is preserved . in principle",
    ", the method can also be applied for coulombic interaction of charged particles between metallic plates .",
    "based on induced charge computation  @xcite ( icc ) method , tyagi  @xcite and coworkers introduced a generic method that can be used for dielectric interface of arbitrary shape .",
    "the method requires a poisson solver suitable for the same geometry in the absence of the dielectric interface .",
    "the method is called icc@xmath6  @xcite in which the star stands as a representative for any poisson solver one employs . the icc@xmath6 algorithm scales basically like the poisson solver employed in the method . in 2013 takae and onuki  @xcite introduced a method for electrostatic interaction of charged and polar particles between metallic plates .",
    "the method is an extension of the ewald method which accounts for the effect of image particles .    in this paper , we present a method to calculate electrostatic interaction of charged point particles between two parallel metallic plates .",
    "the method is based on superposition principle in electrostatics .",
    "in fact , similiar approaches can be applied to electrostatic interaction of charged point particles or continuous charge densities trapped by metallic boundaries with arbitrary shape . in this paper , we focus on slab geometry and we show the particular advantage of the method for this type of geometry .",
    "the method scales basically like the poisson solver of the problem in the absence of the metallic plates .",
    "for slab geometry we employ the p@xmath5d method  @xcite and the algorithm scales as @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the method is accurate and the error in the electrostic energy and other physical quantities of interest such as total charge induced on one of the electrodes can be reduced to an arbitray value .",
    "consider a system of @xmath1 particles with charges @xmath7 at positions @xmath8 in an overall neutral and rectangular simulation box of dimensions @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 with periodic boundary conditions in @xmath12 and @xmath13 directions . in order to model the electrodes , boundary conditions at @xmath14 and @xmath15 are at constant voltages at @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "in fact , @xmath18 indicates the potential different between the two electrodes .",
    "the electrostatic interaction of charged particles with such boundary conditions is not coulombic because @xmath19 function does not satisfy boundary conditions at @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",

    "the green function of poisson s equation for slab geometry with metallic boundary conditions is complicated and no compact functional form of the green function is known .",
    "we propose a method based on the superposition principle in electrostatics that can be used for the calculation of electrostatic interaction of charged particles or continuous charge densities surrounded with metallic materials .",
    "the superposition principle in electrostatics , which is due to the fact that poisson s equation is a linear differential equation , allows us to split the problem into two problems .",
    "the corresponding electric potentials of the two problems , called @xmath22 and @xmath23 , fulfil poisson s equation with different charge densities , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "boundary conditions of the two problems are different as well .",
    "both the new charge densities and boundary conditions are arbitrary and can be anything provided @xmath26 and the two boundary conditions sum up to the original boundary conditions . here",
    "we choose @xmath27 and @xmath28 while for slab geometries the boundary conditions of the first problem is taken to be free in @xmath29 direction and periodic in @xmath12 and @xmath13 directions . in this way one can employ any poisson solver for slablike geometry that have been summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] . from now on @xmath22 and @xmath23 are replaced by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , to emphasize that the first problem is the electric potential due to charged point particles and the second problem is a smooth potential which does not diverge any point within the simulation box .",
    "poisson solver of the first problem must provide potential values at boundaries .",
    "once @xmath30 is calculated we can solve the laplace equation of the second problem with boundary conditions as @xmath32    in our calculations for the coulombic interaction in the first problem , we employ the p@xmath5d method which can provide potential values at any point in the simulation box while it is both efficient and accurate .",
