    "this motion of vortices is further assisted by thermal fluctuations .",
    "however , vortex movement can be hampered due to the pinning barriers arising from disorders present in system .",
    "the measurement of isothermal magnetization ( @xmath8 ) vs. field ( @xmath9 ) and the magnetic relaxation are the most extensively used tools to study the vortex dynamics in a variety of superconducting materials .",
    "@xcite commonly , the appearance of a second peak ( sp ) in field dependent magnetization loop is believed to be directly associated with the nature of pinning and thereof depending vortex creep mechanism .",

    "the scenario of plastic vortex creep was invoked in cuprate superconductors due to failure of the collective creep model in explaining the experimental observations in high fields above the sp .",
    "@xcite to be specific , it is argued that the sp in @xmath8(@xmath9 ) is related to the crossover from collective to plastic creeping of vortices .",

    "furthermore , from the analysis of magnetic relaxation data we conclude that vortex dynamics in co doped ca-122 superconductors is rather of plastic than collective nature .",
    "the comparison with other 122 superconductors might indicate that the observed vortex creep behavior is connected with the strength of pinning energy which varies with the a - site elements of 122 pnictides . however , to generalize this result similar studies are needed in different samples including variety of doping species .",
