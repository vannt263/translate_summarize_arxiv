    "a strong - disorder renormalization group @xcite predicts an exotic infinite - randomness qcp accompanied by quantum griffiths singularities @xcite . at such a qcp , thermodynamic observables are expected to be singular not just at criticality but in a finite region around the qcp called the quantum griffiths phase ( gp ) .",
    "this region features power laws ( e.g. , in the magnetic susceptibility , @xmath9 , and the magnetization , @xmath10 ) characterized by a nonuniversal griffiths exponent @xmath11 which varies with distance to the qcp .",

    "recently , a more systematic variation of the exponents could be found at the ferromagnetic qpt of cepd@xmath1rh@xmath14 @xcite . + to avoid additional complications due to the kondo effect and to study a larger energy scale we recently investigated the simple fcc transition metal alloy ni@xmath1v@xmath2 @xcite as an example of an itinerant ferromagnet ( fm ) in which the transition temperature ( @xmath15 for pure ni ) can be tuned to zero by chemical substitution .",
    "as explained by friedel @xcite the `` disorder '' is introduced because the charge contrast of the replacing vanadium atoms creates large defects yielding an inhomogeneous magnetization density .",
