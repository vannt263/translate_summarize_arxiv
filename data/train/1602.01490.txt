    "no - slip ( or rough ) billiards are a type of billiard dynamical system based upon a model in which linear and angular momentum of a hard spherical particle , moving in an n - dimensional euclidean domain , may be exchanged on collisions at the boundary with total energy conserved , as indicated in the diagram of figure [ fig : intro ] .",
    "gutkin and broomhead introduced no - slip collisions in two dimensions as a new model of a gas , in which `` the spheres interact with each other and with the container walls '' without slipping , in such a way that the impact `` conserves the total energy of the system , but mixes the tangential velocity components with the angular velocities of colliding spheres . ''",
    "@xcite they demonstrate that in two dimensions energy may be conserved only by the specular collisions of the traditional gas model , well - known from standard billiards , or the unique conservative alternative of no - slip collisions .    very little",
    "( none to our knowledge ) seems to have been done regarding the dynamics of no - slip billiards since @xcite . in particular",
    ", the broader implications of the main observation of that paper , concerning a striking boundedness property that they obtain in the very special case of an infinite strip billiard table , were not pursued .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to reintroduce this topic and begin a more systematic study of the dynamics and ergodic theory of no - slip billiards .",
    "in addition to extending the boundedness result of @xcite , we indicate by a combination of analytical and numerical observations that this property should hold in much greater generality than shown by gutkin and broomhead and that it may serve as the basis of a very general non - ergodicity result for this class of billiard systems . we have intentionally kept the technical level of this paper fairly low .",
    "a more systematic development will be taken up elsewhere .",
    "no - slip billiards in dimension @xmath0 arise naturally in @xcite , in which we obtain an exhaustive description of collisions of rigid bodies in @xmath1 satisfying natural physical requirements .",
    "we summarize here the more relevant facts from that paper .",
    "let @xmath2 denote the configuration manifold of two rigid bodies in @xmath1 having smooth boundaries .",
    "we endow @xmath2 with the riemannian metric whose quadratic form gives the system s kinetic energy function and assume that points @xmath3 represent configurations in which the bodies have a single contact point .",
    "at a boundary point @xmath4 of @xmath2 where @xmath5 is differentiable , we define a _ collision map _ as a linear map @xmath6 that sends vectors pointing out of @xmath2 into vectors pointing inward .",
    "we say that @xmath7 is a _ strict collision map _ at @xmath4 if    1 .",
    "energy is conserved .",
    "that is , @xmath7 is an orthogonal linear map ; 2 .",
    "linear and angular momentum are conserved in the unconstrained motion .",
    "( this property , expressed in terms of invariance of a momentum map , may amount to no restriction at all when one of the bodies , representing the billiard table , is assumed fixed in place and the subgroup of euclidean symmetries of the whole system is trivial ) ; 3 .",
    "time reversibility .",
    "this amounts to @xmath7 being a linear involution ; 4 .",
    "impulse forces at collision are applied only at the single point of contact .",
    "( see @xcite for an elaboration and geometric interpretation of this property , which may be regarded as a generalized momentum conservation law that is generally non - trivial and highly restrictive . )",
    "the following result is shown in @xcite .    at each boundary point of the configuration manifold of the system of two rigid bodies , assuming the boundary is differentiable at that point , the set of all strict collision maps can be expressed as the disjoint union of orthogonal grassmannian manifolds @xmath8 , @xmath9 , of all @xmath10 dimensional planes in @xmath11 . in particular , when @xmath12 , the set of strict collision maps is a two - point set consisting of the specular reflection and the no - slip collision .",
    "the geometric description of no - slip collisions is explained in figure [ fig : conemap ] .",
    "in addition to the standard reflection it involves a rotation by the special angle @xmath13 , which is the same for all table shapes .    a billiard system is generally understood to consist of two rigid bodies , one of which is fixed in place and called the _ billiard table_. the focus is then on the motion of the second , referred to as the _ billiard particle_. for the system to be fully specified it is necessary to impose boundary conditions . from our perspective , this amounts to assigning a collision map @xmath14 to each boundary configuration @xmath3 from among those in the moduli of collision maps described by the above theorem .",
    "we offer a variety of examples in @xcite .    on a general newtonian mechanical system without boundary",
    "the so - called liouville volume measure , obtained from the canonical ( symplectic ) form on the cotangent bundle of the configuration manifold @xmath2 , is invariant under the hamiltonian flow .",
    "it is also well - known that the liouville measure remains invariant for systems with boundary when the collision maps correspond to specular reflection , but it is not clear whether this still holds for more general boundary conditions .",
    "we show in @xcite that a sufficient condition for the invariance of the liouville measure is that the field of collision maps @xmath15 be parallel with respect to the levi - civita connection on @xmath5 associated to the kinetic energy riemannian metric .",
    "this condition is satisfied for no - slip billiards on the plane .    the canonical billiard measure on the boundary of the phase space of a planar no - slip billiard is invariant under the billiard map .",
    "having established that no - slip billiard maps preserve the canonical billiard measure , we can venture into ergodic theory .",
    "we may ask , in particular , whether the known constructions giving rise to ergodic billiards of the standard kind also apply to the no - slip kind .",
    "the main result of @xcite about boundedness of trajectories in infinite strip billiard tables , suitably generalized , suggests that ergodicity for no - slip billiards is very difficult to come by . a feature of no - slip billiards that may preclude ergodicity is an _ axis of periodicity _ , a certain type of period two trajectory that will be seen below to be very ubiquitous .",
    "in contrast to periodic points that may exist in standard ergodic billiards , these axes appear to occur as the center of small invariant regions .",
    "the axes occur in a large class of billiards including polygons , as will be seen .",
    "furthermore , phase portraits suggest the dynamics persist under small smooth perturbations",
    ". indications of the invariant regions precluding ergodicity appear in curvilinear polygons in numerical experiments shown here in section [ ex ] . in this paper",
    "we provide evidence indicating that    * gutkin and broomhead s observation that trajectories in infinite strip billiards are bounded holds in much greater generality ; * this boundedness property is a strong obstacle preventing ergodicity .",
    "this behavior demonstrates one marked difference between the dynamics of no - slip billiards and those of standard billiards .",
    "for example , generic polygons ( having angles of irrational multiples of @xmath16 ) are ergodic @xcite , but no - slip billiards on polygons appear never to be ergodic .",
    "note that no - slip billiards in dimension @xmath0 correspond to configuration spaces @xmath2 of dimension @xmath17 , whose points are parametrized by the center of the disk - particle and its angle of rotation . the boundary of @xmath2 is then a two - dimensional , piecewise smooth manifold , and the phase space is a @xmath18-dimensional manifold whose points are pairs @xmath19 in which @xmath3 and @xmath20 may be taken to lie in a hemisphere ( whose radius is determined by the conserved kinetic energy ) about the normal vector to @xmath5 at @xmath4 pointing into @xmath2 . in this paper",
    "we identify this hemisphere with the disk of same radius in the tangent space to @xmath5 at @xmath4 under the natural orthogonal projection .",
    "thus the phase space of our billiards , at least in the case of bounded ( and connected ) billiard tables , will typically be homeomorphic to the cartesian product of a @xmath0-torus and a disk . a simplification results by noting that the angle of rotation ( but certainly not the speed of rotation ) is typically immaterial .",
    "formally this means that we may for many purposes consider the _ reduced phase space _ , defined as the quotient of the @xmath18-dimensional phase space by the natural action of the rotation group @xmath21 .",
    "the resulting @xmath17-dimensional solid torus is indicated in the diagram of figure [ fig:3d ] . in many cases",
    "key feature may be gleaned from the projection to the velocity components , which we refer to as the velocity phase portrait .",
    "see figure [ fig : hexa ] for an example .        in section [ perbd ]",
    "we consider several examples of no - slip billiards in dimension two , beginning by revisiting the `` no - slip billiard on a strip '' from @xcite .",
    "we give an alternate proof of boundedness which turns out to extend to dimension three and show that there are no non - trivial periodic orbits . turning to the open infinite wedge",
    ", we show that all orbits not eventually escaping are bounded and that the wedge angle may be chosen for any @xmath22 such that _ all _ bounded orbits are periodic with period @xmath23 .",
    "the kind of localization of orbits near what we have called _ axis of periodicity _ noted here for wedge billiards is observed for very general billiard shapes containing flat points , and perhaps many others .",
    "this suggests that a detailed analysis of wedge billiards and their smooth perturbations is fundamental for understanding the dynamics of general no - slip billiards .",
    "section [ ex ] comprises examples of polygons , circles , and other simple shapes .    in standard billiards , two well - known techniques for generating chaotic dynamics are the defocusing and dispersing mechanisms .",
    "the stadium of bunimovich @xcite , the most well - known example of chaotic focusing , consists of two half circles connected by flat segments .",
    "the corresponding no - slip billiard , however , fails to be ergodic , as any arbitrarily small flat strip will have bounded orbits for all trajectories in a neighborhood of positive measure near the vertical trajectory ( figure [ fig : stad - disp ] , left ) . while apparently no such elementary argument can be used to show that the dispersing examples of standard billiards are not ergodic in the no - slip case , some insight is gleaned from the velocity phase portraits .",
    "sinai billiards with boundaries which are entirely dispersing generate strong chaotic behavior in standard billiards @xcite . while numerical analysis of phase portraits of corresponding no - slip examples tends to show potentially chaotic behavior for most orbits , exceptional orbits forming closed curves suggest the possibility of non - ergodic behavior near periodic points .",
    "figure [ fig : stad - disp ] ( right ) shows a bounded component for one of the simplest dispersing cases , a disk on a flat torus .",
    "the basic properties obtained from the strip and wedge examples of this section will be important tools in general for understanding no - slip dynamics . if the unconstrained model for two rigid bodies in @xcite is adapted to one fixed body and a non - intersecting but otherwise unconstrained disk of uniform mass distribution , then the post - collision rotational and linear velocity @xmath24 is the function of the pre - collision velocities @xmath25 given by @xmath26 r_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\nu - ( v^-\\cdot \\nu ) \\nu , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the matrix of counterclockwise rotation by angle @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the inward normal vector at the point of contact .    for dimension two we may use coordinates @xmath30 , with planar position @xmath31 and normalized rotational position @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the radius of the disk .",
    "note that the rotation adds a third dimension to the two spacial dimensions .",
    "sometimes , if there is no loss of information , the given figures will be the planar projection .",
    "also , without any essential alteration of the theory we may use the orbit of the center of mass , with boundaries accordingly adjusted by distance @xmath33 . if the upward normal is in the direction @xmath34 , then by [ update2 ] the pre- and post - collision velocities are related by @xmath35 where @xmath36 and the transformation matrix @xmath37 is @xmath38   \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3 } & \\frac{1}{3 } & 0\\\\[6pt ]   0 & 0 & -1 \\end{array}\\right)}.\\ ] ]      as an application of no - slip collisions , broomhead and gutkin @xcite considered a disk between two parallel horizontal boundaries .",
    "we normalize the separation to give unit time between collisions . using complex coordinates for the phase space and finding a series for the horizontal displacement after @xmath39 collisions",
    ", it was noted in @xcite that the orbit is always bounded , except for the case of zero vertical velocity .",
    "the following strengthening of this main result in @xcite holds for unit velocity and fixed unit separation , letting @xmath40 be the parallel direction , so that the time between collisions will be @xmath41 , constant as @xmath42 only changes sign at collisions .",
    "[ pr : horbd ] orbits of a two dimensional system of no - slip collisions with parallel boundaries have horizontal displacement no more than @xmath43 .    viewing the trajectories in three dimensions",
    ", we will show that for each boundary plane the set of collision points is contained in a line ( figure [ fig:3dview2dstrip ] ) .",
    "consider any two successive collision points @xmath44 and @xmath45 on the upper wall , choosing coordinates with the origin at the intermediate collision on the lower wall and letting @xmath46 be the velocity after the collision at @xmath44 .",
    "then @xmath47 and [ eq : rt ] gives @xmath48 and @xmath49 the slope in the @xmath50 ( horizontal - rotational ) plane is @xmath51 independent of the initial conditions .",
    "therefore , all of the collision points on the upper wall lie on a line of slope @xmath52 , and a similar argument on the lower wall shows that all collisions occur on a line of slope @xmath53 .",
    "as no velocity is exchanged between the horizontal - rotational component and the vertical component , the length of segments representing the projection of the orbits between successive collisions will be @xmath54 .",
    "geometrically , the orbits are contained in an astroid ( figure [ fig : parastr ] ) with the given bound , the maximal horizontal displacement being achieved when the ( projection of ) the trajectories is perpendicular to the contact line .",
    "the no - slip strip can never have more than three consecutive trajectory segments in the same horizontal direction : considering the trajectory segments in the upper , left , lower , and right quadrants of the @xmath55 plane as delineated by the contact lines ( as in figure [ fig : parastr ] ) , no two consecutive trajectories both lie in the upper ( or lower ) quadrants . at most two consecutive trajectories",
    "may lie in the left ( or right ) quadrants .    in the case of three spacial dimensions , the argument of proposition [ pr : horbd ]",

    "suppose that the orbit arrives back on the starting side but not at the same point , and consider subsequent returns after multiples of six collisions .",
    "the second set of trajectories will be parallel to the first all the way around and accordingly the sequence of walls will not change . now consider the finite partition of the original wall by degenerate points where an orbit in the fixed direction from that point eventually hits a vertex .",

    "the projection of the velocity phase portrait of an isosceles triangle no - slip billiard is given in figure [ fig : isos ] , where overlapping orbits are the result of the projection .",
    "this pattern is typical of polygons , with most orbits appearing as closed curves around periodic points , with the number of components matching the period of the central point .",
    "numerical evidence suggests that for no - slip polygons there may be no positive measure ergodic components .",
    "standard billiards with entirely concave boundaries are dispersing , with wave fronts expanding at every collision .",
    "in contrast , the chaotic behavior of the bunimovich stadium depends upon a defocusing mechanism : convex boundaries create a focusing front , but under circumstances in which the front passes through a focusing point and sees a net expansion before colliding at the next boundary .",
    "looking at billiards with left and right edges identified and concave ( or convex ) upper and lower boundaries , both mechanisms appear to arise in the no - slip case as well .",
    "( see figure [ fig : focus ] . ) to trigger a comparable level of defocusing after the same number of collisions for an equally spaced wave front , a greater curvature is required for the no - slip case .",
    "as the no - slip examples are projections , with independent expansion or contraction arising in the rotational dimension , the behavior may be more nuanced .        in spite of the apparent defocusing",
    ", the stadium has a bounded positive measure component phase space and is not ergodic .",
    "similarly , other known standard billiard examples fail to be ergodic in the no - slip case : the ` mushroom ' billiard @xcite has a similar bounded component in the stem , the ` flower ' billiard fails to be ergodic by remark [ rem : circerg ] , while ` pocket ' billiards are not ergodic for both of the above reasons . in these cases",
    "the no - slip phase portraits show a mixture of structured orbits mixed surrounded by potential chaotic seas ( figure [ fig : combinederg ] ) .",
    "the ` moon ' billiard , recently shown to exhibit ergodic behavior for some parameters @xcite , does not appear to be ergodic in the no - slip case .",
    "along with the mushroom billiard , its phase portrait exhibits segments along which orbits linger before moving to apparent chaotic regions .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively similar to the known _ marginally unstable periodic orbits _ of standard billiards which",
    "both the moon @xcite and mushroom @xcite @xcite are known to exhibit .",
