    "the quantum computation are potentially more powerful than its classical counterparts @xcite .",
    "in particular some quantum algorithms enabling the dramatic speedup has opened new possiblities of quantum computation to solve hard problems @xcite .",
    "it is usually considered that the hard problems have so many candidate solutions that it is hard ( or practically impossible ) to search the exact solution among them quickly . such hard problems",
    "are usually classified as `` non - deterministic polynomial ( np ) class '' in complexity theory @xcite .",
    "thus researchers in this field have expected a succession of quantum agorithm to solve the np problems , depending on _ quantum superposition _ which enables to investigate simultaneously all the states .",
    "however the development of quantum algorithms has been rather stagnant , with any remarkable quantum algorithms having not been discovered in the last few years @xcite , and it is still unclear that all np problems can efficiently be solved by quantum algorithm .",
    "on the other hand , in computational science , heuristic approach is one of the most efficient ways to solve the np problems . in heuristic approach ,",
    "the problem is usually simplified at the cost of accuracy , and thus it may fail to find the exact solution @xcite .",
    "heuristic algorithm , instead , enable us to gain computational speedeup by finding the approximate solution , near to the exact one , so quickly .",
    "therefore it is natural that current research in quantum algorithm has been directed towards using this heuristic approach @xcite .",
    "however , it also has not been elucidated thoroughly that the heuristic approach is _ always _ helpful for speedup when we deal with the problem in a quantum - mechanical way . the present work is actually motivated by the goal of investigating this issue .    as aforementioned",
    ", it is generally known that the heuristic approach is useful to solve the hard problems .",
    "however , in the case of using the quantum system , this remains valid only for the search problem @xcite .",
    "in addition , the heuristic algorithms are problem - specific : there is no guarantee that a heuristic procedure used for one problem will be applicable to others @xcite .",
    "therefore we consider a particular set of problems , called `` np - complete '' , because of the property that _ all np problems can efficiently be mapped into a problem in this class _ @xcite .",
    "typical examples belonging to the np - complete class are a traveling salesman problem ( tsp ) and an exact cover @xcite .",
    "we consider exclusively the tsp in this paper .",
    "thus , if a effective heuristic algorithm for tsp were found , it could be mapped into a procedure for solving all np problems even though problem - specific .    in tsp",
    ", a salesman travels @xmath0 cities by visiting each city once and only once , and returning to the starting city .",
    "the problem is to find the lowest - cost tour among @xmath1 possible tours , where the symbol `` @xmath2 '' stands for the factorial . throughout the paper",
    ", we assume that the oracle answers only the overall cost for the given tour when queried , hiding the details on the costs of city pairs .",
    "this assumption is made in order to compare the performances of algorithms under the equal conditions , neglecting any improvement by structural information ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for such an improvement ) .",
    "with such an oracle of the tour costs , a classical exact algorithm is to query the costs of all the tours until finding the cheapest . as the cheapest cost is unknown , contrary to the data search where the target is known @xcite , the search should be done over all the tours .",
    "this demands a huge number of @xmath3 queries , independent of whether the algorithm is deterministic or probabilistic .    many quantum approaches for the tsp ( or equivalent to this problem )",
    "have been studied @xcite .",
    "in particular the quantum annealing method was investigated for the tsp @xcite .",
    "it has been discussed , however , that finding a ground state becomes extremely difficult as increasing the size of system ( or equivalently the number of cities ) @xcite .",
    "it is unclear that the quantum annealing can be applied to the extremely large number of cities . on the other hand",
    ", one may convert a tsp to the problem of finding a minimum for a given cost function , called `` a minimum search . '' a quantum algorithm to obtain an exact solution of minimum search was proposed , based on grover search , which works in @xmath4 queries , where @xmath5 is the number of elements ( or tours in tsp ) @xcite .",
    "this is the quadratic speedup of the classical exact algorithm earlier , as @xmath6 .",
    "we instead consider a classical heuristic algorithm which is adapted to the circumstance : the tours along the cost @xmath7 are distributed , close to a normal distribution with the average @xmath8 and the standard deviation @xmath9 in the limit of the large number of cities , @xmath10 . this circumstance has commonly been considered in the literatures @xcite .",
    "( the statistical information can easily be estimated by sampling a small number of tours . ) taking an approximate solution to be a tour whose cost is less than @xmath9 , the probability @xmath11 of finding a solution is asymptotically given , @xmath12 then the classical heuristic algorithm is following : query @xmath13 tours that are randomly chosen and find the cheapest one among those tours .",
    "then one solution is `` likely '' to be found within @xmath14 number of queries .",
    "note that this classical heuristic algorithm is much faster than the exact quantum algorithm by removing the logarithm in the exponent .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a quantum heuristic algorithm for the tsp by generalizing grover operation .",
    "sufficient conditions are derived under which the algorithm can greatly enhance the probability of finding approximate tours with the cheapest costs , reaching almost to unity .",
    "these conditions are characterized by statistical properties of tour costs and shown to be automatically satisfied in the large number limit of cities .",
    "the present quantum heuristic algorithm is shown to work in @xmath15 queries , a quadratic speed up of the classical heuristic algorithm with its order @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chap ] ) .",
    "to represent the tours quantum - mechanically , an orthonormal basis set of @xmath5 states are appropriate and they are fully discriminated by a von - neumann orthogonal measurement .",
    "we assume that a quantum register is of @xmath5 dimension for a sake of simplicity and its basis states @xmath16 respectively correspond to the tours @xmath17 .",
    "an oracle operation @xmath18 is introduced to answer the tour cost , when applied , such that @xmath19 where @xmath20 stands for the overall cost , given tour @xmath21 , and it is called a cost phase . here , every cost phase is defined in between @xmath22 and @xmath23 by scaling the tour costs .",
    "the scaling can easily be made once obtaining the strictly lower and upper bounds of the tour costs @xcite .",
    "_ it is remarkable that the oracle constructed will not expose any details such as the city - pair costs but just the overall tour costs_. in order to construct the cost oracle , it is convenient to define a tour state as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 stands for the k - th visiting city , and @xmath26 is both the starting city and finally visiting city @xcite .",
    "the conditional operation @xmath27 is also introduced for cost oracle , such that @xmath28 , where @xmath29 denotes the cost from @xmath30-th to @xmath31-th visiting city . since this conditional operation @xmath27 is efficiently be decomposable to two - qubit and/or hadamard gates  @xcite , we can finally construct a cost oracle @xmath18 with relatively small computational efforts by using the @xmath27 ( as depicted in fig .

    "( [ eq : ggo ] ) consists of not two reflections but a single reflection and the cost oracle .",
    "this is the distinct feature of the generalized grover operator , different from those investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the definition of @xmath59 is made by observing two simple cases . in each case , the tours are divided into several groups according to their costs . the @xmath30-th group contains the number @xmath60 of tours and their costs @xmath7 are all to be encoded to a certain cost phase @xmath61 .",

    "assuming @xmath66 , @xmath59 is directly approximated to the grover operator @xmath32 , upto the first order of @xmath67 .",
    "we can then find the tours of @xmath62 group with near unity probability .",
    "the other simple case is that the tours are divided into four groups , each of which has the cost phase @xmath68 for @xmath69 , respectively .",

    "it is convenient to define four states @xmath72 by @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the @xmath30-th group , and hence the sum is over the tours @xmath21 in @xmath74 .",

    "the subspace spanned by @xmath78 remains invariant under the transformations by the cost oracle @xmath18 and the reflection @xmath79 : @xmath80 and @xmath81 with some real numbers @xmath82 .",
    "as long as staying in the subspace , both operators can be represented in terms of @xmath78 . in particular , the cost oracle @xmath18 is reduced and equivalent to @xmath83 where @xmath84 is an identity operator in the subspace .",

    "it is remarkable that , in our approach , we do not have to generalize the `` phase matching condition '' @xcite .",
    "noting @xmath97 , then @xmath98 iterations of @xmath99 approximately transform @xmath100 it is clearly seen that the probability of finding @xmath94 is greatly enhanced as @xmath101 , reminding of @xmath102 .",
