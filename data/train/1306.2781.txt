    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics contains a number of parameters whose values are not predicted by theory and must therefore be measured by experiment . in the quark sector , the elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite determine the rates of the weak transitions between quark flavours , and precision measurements of their values are desirable",

    "is poorly known .",
    "both inclusive and exclusive methods of measuring @xmath19 have been pursued , with the results of the two approaches being in some tension  @xcite .",
    "it is the aim of an ongoing programme at the @xmath1 factories to improve the precision of these measurements , in order to provide a more stringent comparison of exclusive and inclusive results , which have somewhat different experimental and theoretical uncertainties , and to provide a sharp consistency test with the value of @xmath16 .",
    "measurements of branching fractions for exclusive decays , where @xmath20 denotes a light meson containing a @xmath21 quark and @xmath0 an electron or muon , have been reported by the cleo @xcite ,  @xcite and belle  @xcite collaborations .",
