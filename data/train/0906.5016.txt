    "the lhc enters a new energy regime to explore the origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking , search for and study physics beyond the standard model  ( sm ) . at its design center - of - mass energy ,",
    "new physics production cross sections may be significant so that a data sample of modest integrated luminosity , 100 pb@xmath4 or less , may contain a large number of new particles .",
    "the challenge is to distinguish events with new particles from those , many orders of magnitude more copious , attributed to the sm with limited understanding of the sm production rates and detector performance in early lhc data .    missing transverse energy , @xmath5 , has discriminating power to reveal new particles interacting weakly with ordinary matter produced via high energy parton collisions in laboratory conditions at the lhc .",
    "these weakly interacting particles may comprise the dark matter of our universe  @xcite .",
    "they are expected in new physics models , such as r - parity conserving super - symmetry  @xcite and many others  @xcite .",
    "missing transverse energy allows to perform a broad search sensitive to the presence of such particles in collision data and is an observable that may lead to an early discovery at the lhc  @xcite . at the same time , missing transverse energy is one of the most difficult observables to measure precisely and simulate accurately  @xcite because it is measured by multiple detector sub - systems and subject to mis - measurements and backgrounds in any of them .    in this paper ,",
    "i discuss a new method  @xcite to predict backgrounds at high @xmath5   for new physics searches in signatures consistent with sm @xmath0+jets   and  @xcite , where @xmath0 is a @xmath1 , @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "i assume that new particles are heavy and decay to sm particles emitting multiple jets so that high sensitivity is expected at high @xmath5   and a large number of jets .",
    "since main sources of artificial @xmath5   come from the system of jets , the detector and non - collision effects , i model the instrumental response to the system of jets in @xmath0+jets and other effects at high @xmath5   _ in - situ _ using multi - jet qcd events .",
    "this method complements and extends the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , where events with high rapidity objects are used to model sm @xmath0+jets and multi - jet backgrounds in new physics searches without heavy reliance on @xmath5 .",
    "the emphasis of this work , as that of ref .",
    "@xcite , is on robustness against imperfections of background modeling required for new physics searches in early lhc data .",
    "monte carlo  ( mc ) simulation capable of modeling the detector response to sm processes is a great asset in new physics searches .",
    "however , there are two challenges in searches of early lhc data based on mc simulation",
    ". first , the sm @xmath6jets production rates are difficult to predict from first principles .",
    "mc techniques are unreliable in predicting backgrounds with a large number of jets and need to be tuned with high @xmath7 data .",
    "theory calculations at sufficiently high order in many cases do not exist  @xcite .",
    "the structure functions have significant uncertainties in the small @xmath8 range accessible at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "second , significant uncertainties in the calibration of the experimental apparatus are expected in early data taking .",
    "missing transverse energy is an observable that is particularly difficult to measure precisely and simulate accurately , since large jet energy fluctuations , detector artifacts , collision related and non - collision effects can produce non - gaussian high @xmath5   tails .",
    "these artificial @xmath5   tails may resemble a signature of a new weakly interacting particle .    to introduce the method ,",
    "let us consider an event with a @xmath1 boson reconstructed in the di - muon channel and four jets .",
    "the four - momentum of the @xmath1 is well - measured so that the system of the four jets and other effects unrelated to the di - muon system are the main source of @xmath5   in this event . in order to develop a search in @xmath5   based on mc simulation",
    ", one would need to identify , understand and simulate the detector response to each of these effects .",
    "instead , i model these effects in - situ using multi - jet qcd events as follows .",
    "a sample of qcd events with four jets that have approximately the same configuration as the four jet system of the   event is selected .",
    "a @xmath5   prediction , or a template , for this   event is obtained using the @xmath5   distribution measured in the selected qcd sample and normalized to unity .",
    "this procedure is repeated for all other   events .",
    "the @xmath5   templates are summed up to obtain a sm @xmath5   prediction for the entire   sample .",
    "the photon momentum in   is also well - measured so that the same procedure applies to obtain a sm @xmath5   prediction in the   sample . in   and   with one of the two top quarks decaying semileptonically , the @xmath9+jets+@xmath5   signature , there is genuine @xmath5   from the undetected neutrino produced in @xmath3 decays . to avoid reliance on mc and theory ,",
    "i model the neutrino   spectra using charged lepton   spectra .",
    "if @xmath3 bosons are not polarized in the transverse plane , the two spectra should be the same .",
    "event selection and polarized @xmath3 bosons produced in top quark decays lead to differences in the charged lepton and neutrino spectra .",
    "however , these differences are small and can be accounted for by corrections . a prediction for artificial @xmath5   in   and",
    "is derived in the same manner as for   and combined with a modeled neutrino   spectrum to obtain a sm @xmath5   prediction in the @xmath9+jets+@xmath5   final state .    since higher sensitivity to new physics",
    "is expected in events with a large number of jets , the focus is to model high @xmath5   region in @xmath0+jets   events with 3 or more jets .",
    "events with 2  jets are valuable as a validation and calibration sample .",
    "this method is developed for searches in early lhc data .",
    "it will work best if the lhc start - up is quick , new particles are strongly produced and not very heavy , @xmath10 such as squarks and gluinos in the low mass msugra cms and atlas benchmarks  @xcite . with this in mind , a prediction of sm backgrounds in high @xmath5   tails to about 20% may be sufficient to reveal new physics .",
    "for this reason , an accuracy benchmark for this method is to predict sm backgrounds in @xmath0+jets at high @xmath5   and a large number of jets  ( 3 jets or more ) to about 20% or better in a data - driven manner .",
    "the cms and atlas experiments use multi - purpose detectors at the european organization for nuclear research  ( cern ) .",

    "higher jet   thresholds , 50 gev or more , are used to measure other observables in a robust manner as indicated below .",

    "it is assumed that the triggering and event reconstruction efficiency in each channel is 50% .",
    "+    the vector of missing transverse energy , @xmath20 , is calculated as the vector opposite to the sum of @xmath22 measurements of charged leptons , photons , and jets in each event . since electron , muon and photon momenta",
    "are measured with high precision compared to jets , their contribution to artificial @xmath5   in events with a large number of jets is negligible . to emulate detector resolution effects for jets , jet energies measured by pythia are smeared .",
    "the jet smearing function has three components : a ) a gaussian with @xmath23 where @xmath24 is measured in gev , b ) an exponential low - side tail that stretches from @xmath25 $ ] to 0.0 added to the gaussian component 3% of the time , and c ) similarly , an exponential high - side tail from @xmath26 $ ] to infinity added to the gaussian 1% of the time .",
    "figure  [ figure-1 ] shows the   dependence of the gaussian smearing and the full smearing function with the non - gaussian tails for a few fixed jet   values .",
    "this jet smearing function is constructed based on studies of the cms and atlas detectors  @xcite to represent the jet response characteristic of the two detectors .",
    "since the jet system tends to be the dominant source of artificial @xmath5 , all three components of the jet smearing function are varied in the studies of robustness and limitations of the method discussed below .",

    "let us assume that the @xmath0  momentum in a @xmath0+jets event is known .",

    "a prominent difference between the jet systems in @xmath0+jets and qcd is that in @xmath0+jets events the jet system recoils against the @xmath0 while in qcd events it is at rest in the transverse plane .",
    "a key is to select multi - jet qcd events to predict @xmath5   in a manner that captures effects generating artificial @xmath5   in - situ but allows for the difference stemming from the boost of the jet system in the transverse plane in @xmath0+jets .",
    "it is not necessary to model accurately every degree of freedom in the jet system of @xmath6jets on an event - by - event basis by qcd for two reasons .",

    "the algorithm performs at least as well when the set of higher jet   thresholds for @xmath27 is used .",

    ", the jet energy smearing is increased .",
    "two tests are made : ( a )  the gaussian @xmath46 is doubled with the area and shape of the non - gaussian tails unchanged , and ( b ) the area of the low and high - side non - gaussian tails is doubled with the gaussian component kept unchanged .",
    "the effect of the additional jet energy smearing in test  ( a ) on the @xmath5   distribution in   for @xmath44 is shows in figure  [ figure-6 ] in the dotted grey line . ratios of observed and estimated yields from test  ( a ) are in square markers in figure  [ figure-7 ] for @xmath44 .",
    "similar results are observed in the other two @xmath27 bins , and in test  ( b ) .",
    "again , templates constructed from multi - jet qcd events capture effects from additional jet smearing in - situ so that the level of background at high @xmath5   in @xmath6jets is predicted accurately .    hot cells or noise in the calorimeters , backgrounds from the proton beams , cosmic rays , underlying event or additional @xmath47 interactions in the same bunch crossing contribute extra energy and jets erroneously attributed to those produced in @xmath0+jets and qcd processes .",
    "since additional jets have higher probability to be soft , i test the method s ability to model such effects by adding extra jets with a soft uniform   spectrum from 0 to 50  gev with a 20% probability to each @xmath0+jets or qcd event .",

    "the origin of this bias stems from differences in @xmath27 and @xmath29 distributions between @xmath0+jets and qcd .",

    "the quality of the @xmath5   prediction improves at larger @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath5   prediction is robust for @xmath44 and  @xmath41 in all tests .",
    "events with @xmath45 are more susceptible to biases for two reasons .",
    "first , there are significant differences in the differential distributions describing jets in qcd and @xmath0+jets : in qcd di - jets , the jets come mainly from leading order parton interactions , while in @xmath0+jets , the jets are from higher order processes .",
    "second , the averaging effects discussed in section  [ algorithm ] are not as strong when the number of jets is small .",
    "nevertheless , only two tests for @xmath45 are biased in this section . any other effect that generates artificial @xmath5   in the same manner in the jet system of @xmath0+jets and multi - jet qcd events",
    "should be modeled in - situ by the method .",
    "i next discuss the method s limitations revealed in more stringent tests .",
    "i increase the degree of jet mis - reconstruction up to a point where the method becomes biased to explore the boundaries of the domain where the method works .",
    "this allows to understand in greater detail mechanisms that may lead to a bias . at the end of this section ,",
    "i discuss how to avoid regimes where the method is biased .",
    "the test with the jet veto cone introduced in the previous section is repeated with a modification such that leading jets falling into the veto cone are removed .",
    "this is a stringent test since leading jets are less likely to be undetected .",
    "test results are shown in figure  [ figure-8 ] in circular markers , for brevity , only for   in the @xmath56 bin .",
    "while the prediction partly takes into account the effect of undetected leading jets , it underestimates the background at high @xmath5   in that @xmath27 bin in   and .",
    "the prediction is biased because in qcd events @xmath5   is always less than @xmath29 , by the definition of @xmath5   in section  [ experiment ] . in @xmath0+jets , @xmath0 is a @xmath1 or @xmath2 here , @xmath5   can be greater than @xmath29 when the leading jet recoiling against an energetic @xmath0  boson in the transverse plane is lost .",

    "the prediction of the full @xmath5 , which includes the neutrino momentum , is good in all @xmath27 bins .",
    "note , for a large low - side tail in the jet response function , the jet energy scale may become biased .",
    "effects due to a jet energy scale offset are discussed in section  [ jet - energy - scale ] .",
    "i make two tests with a harder spectrum of additional energy contributions unrelated to   and qcd events . in these tests ,",
    "the spectrum of additional energy is uniform in   from 0 to 1  tev added with a 1% probability to both @xmath0+jets   and qcd . since there is no genuine @xmath5   in   and qcd , the requirement on @xmath57  ( section  [ experiment ] ) that @xmath20   and the leading jet be not aligned in the transverse plane removes a fraction of events with high @xmath58 extraneous contributions . in the first test , additional energy depositions contribute only to jets that are above the   threshold for @xmath27 . the @xmath5   distribution in , @xmath32 , is shown in the dotted black line in figure  [ figure-6 ] with a large artificial high @xmath5   tail . ratios of observed and estimated yields are in triangular  ( up ) markers in figure  [ figure-8 ] .",

    "if the mis - measured fraction of multi - jet qcd events is larger , the prediction overestimates the background .",
    "otherwise , the predicted background is underestimated .",
    "regimes with severely misreconstructed events where the method may become biased need to be avoided . by imposing event quality criteria or improving the jet reconstruction , @xmath10 using the tracking systems ,  @xcite one can reduce the number of such events .",

    "the @xmath0+jets   sample with @xmath45 is the most challenging for this method .",
    "the method performs better at higher @xmath29 and @xmath27 , where the sensitivity to new physics is higher .",
    "there are several reasons for that : a )  there are fewer differences between the hadronic systems in @xmath0+jets and qcd , b )  the averaging effects over @xmath0+jets and qcd events are stronger and c )  the jet reconstruction performs better at higher jet .",

    "two observations can be made .",
    "first , the bias becomes smaller when the jet   threshold for @xmath5   and @xmath29 is reduced or the @xmath68  coverage for jets is increased since the total energy is collected to a fuller extent with more inclusive requirements .",
    "optimal requirements on these variables can only be determined using data because at smaller   and larger @xmath69 more noise and backgrounds are expected .",
    "second , in , there tends to be more jets included in the @xmath5   and @xmath29 calculations that are below the jet   threshold for @xmath27 .",

    "alternatively , the same effect can be achieved by modifying the composition of the qcd sample used for templates .",
    "jet energy measurements can be systematically biased in early data .",
    "let us consider a case when jet energies are under - measured uniformly in jet .",
    "such mis - measurements cancel to first order in @xmath5   measurements in qcd events . in @xmath0+jets , since the jet system recoils against the @xmath0 , the jet energy mis - measurements add up coherently along the @xmath0 direction in the transverse plane . to avoid a bias due to this difference , the jet energy scale needs to be calibrated . since the method is capable to model large tails in the jet response function , a precise calibration of the jet energy scale as a function of @xmath68 and @xmath37  ( azimuthal angle ) is not required .",

    "demands on the precision of the jet energy calibration in @xmath9+jets+@xmath5   are higher .",
