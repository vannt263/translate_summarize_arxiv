    "chapter  5 discusses the results of the thermal analysis .",
    "the chemical composition of the fireball at freeze  out is determined , and the consistency of chemical and thermal freeze  out temperatures is addressed . finally , the freeze  out conditions of hadronic matter as derived for the sis energy regime are compared to results obtained from similar analyses of particle ratios measured at significantly higher incident energies at the ags ( brookhaven national laboratory ) and the sps ( cern ) .",
    "in the initial phase of nucleus  nucleus collisions with incident kinetic energies @xmath7 around 1@xmath0  gev a system of interacting nucleons , resonances , and mesons is created .",
    "the size of the hadronic fireball depends on the masses of target and projectile nucleus and , in addition , on the centrality of the collision . within the participant  spectator model ,",
    "the geometrical overlap of the two nuclei determines the number of nucleons @xmath8 which are directly involved .",
    "the quantity b = @xmath8 thus defines the number of baryons in the system . for symmetric collisions and complete stopping the energy available per baryon",
    "is @xmath9 , with s given by @xmath10 and @xmath11 denoting the nucleon mass .",
    "the initial conditions of the fireball are therefore fixed . in the subsequent time evolution",
    "the available energy is transformed into the excitation of thermal and collective degrees of freedom .",
    "the energy turns into heat and provides the mass stored in resonance states and mesons at chemical freeze  out .",
    "in addition , the energy builds up compression and produces the flow of the expanding matter .    in a simplified picture hadrons",
    "can not escape from the fireball during the high  density phase of the collision .",
    "nucleons , resonances , and mesons are trapped in a cyclic process of generation , absorption , and re  emission , exemplified for nucleons @xmath12 , @xmath13 mesons , and @xmath14 resonances by @xmath15 . within this approach hadrons",
    "are released only with the onset of the expansion phase , when mesons and baryons decouple due to the decreasing matter density .",
    "moments in the expansion process when certain degrees of freedom of the system no longer participate in the interaction provide landmarks in the time evolution .",
    "one has to distinguish between chemical and thermal freeze  out which  in the limit of sudden freeze  out  correspond to those moments in time when the relative abundances of the particle species or their momentum distributions stop to change .",
    "while only inelastic collisions involving the short  range nuclear force can alter the relative particle yields , the momentum distributions of the particles are governed by the larger total interaction cross sections .",
    "consequently , thermal freeze  out does not occur before chemical freeze  out . through the frequent scattering processes of the constituents the system maintains chemical and eventually thermal equilibrium .",
    "it has been shown that at the ags ( @xmath16 13.7@xmath0  gev ) and the sps ( 200@xmath0  gev ) a large number of hadronic observables , including strange  particle yields , is in quite good agreement with such an equilibrium scenario @xcite . at the much lower sis energies , however",
    ", only a very limited variety of hadron species is produced with significant yields .",
    "therefore , in contrast to the situation at ags and sps energies , the number of observables which may reflect the chemical or thermal freeze  out is comparable to the number of free parameters in common thermal models .",
    "nevertheless , several analyses have been performed to check for consistency between data and thermal  model predictions also at sis energies .",
    "midrapidity transverse ",
    "momentum spectra of charged pions , protons , and deuterons measured in central ni  +  ni collisions at 1.06@xmath0 , 1.45@xmath0 , and 1.93@xmath0  gev were observed to be consistent with thermal equilibrium if , in addition , collective radial flow was taken into account @xcite .",
    "for the same reactions also chemical equilibrium has been claimed with close agreement between the chemical freeze  out temperatures and the temperatures derived from the particle spectra .",
    "recently , cleymans et al .  have extended the thermal analysis at sis energies to comprise also the strange mesons k@xmath17 and k@xmath18 . in their systematic study of central collisions of ni  +  ni and au",
    "+  au based on a model with canonical strangeness conservation @xcite the yields of protons , deuterons , charged pions , and k mesons were found to agree with chemical equilibrium at freeze  out .",
    "failure of their analysis to also accomodate the @xmath4 meson within this common freeze  out picture @xcite may be attributed to the use of extrapolated @xmath4 yields .",
    "pions and @xmath4 mesons are the most abundantly produced mesons at sis energies . while the pionic degree of freedom is also covered by the spectroscopy of the charged members of the isospin multiplet , it is only through @xmath19-ray spectroscopy that the @xmath4 meson becomes observable in nucleus  nucleus collisions .",
    "the two neutral mesons @xmath3 and @xmath4 can both be identified by a two - photon invariant  mass analysis of coincident photon pairs .",
    "using the two  arm photon spectrometer , the taps collaboration performed a series of systematic meson  production experiments covering incident energies from 0.2@xmath0  gev to 2.0@xmath0  gev .",
    "these measurements have established an extended data base for @xmath3 and @xmath4 production in light ( c  +  c ) , intermediate  mass ( ar , ca  +  ca ) , and heavy symmetric systems ( ni  +  ni , kr  +  zr , au  +  au ) @xcite .    the primary information for the present discussion is provided by the inclusive meson yields .",

    "a steep rise of the normalized meson ratios with increasing energy is observed .",
    "in addition , a weaker dependence on the size of the collision system is visible with the clear tendency towards smaller inclusive yields in the heavier systems .",
    "the same trends have also been observed in charged  pion production experiments @xcite . in first approximation",
    "all data points fall onto a smooth curve indicating that to a large extent the meson  production probability is determined by the energy available per baryon .",
    "this is quite remarkable because @xmath3 and @xmath4 production proceed through different baryon resonances : @xmath3 mesons mainly come from @xmath23resonance decays , while the heavier @xmath4 mesons essentially originate from the @xmath24 resonance which , at sis energies , is the only significantly populated baryon resonance with a large decay width into @xmath4 mesons .",
    "the fact that the basic production mechanism is no longer apparent in the observed meson yields may be interpreted as a first indication for meson emission from an equilibrated source .",
    "the second important result concerns the average transverse momenta @xmath25 at midrapidity .",

    ". for resonances embedded in an isotropic fireball one therefore expects average transverse momenta obeying @xmath26 .",

    "although the uncertainties for the @xmath4 data are large compared to those of the @xmath3 data , the @xmath4 momenta are clearly higher than the @xmath3 values , opposite to the expectation . for both mesons the initial rise of @xmath25 slows down with increasing available energy , indicating possible saturation of the average transverse momentum .",
    "we conclude that also with respect to the shapes of the meson spectra the naive expectations based on the production mechanism are not borne out experimentally .    as a third piece of evidence for thermal behavior we mention the transverse ",
    "mass spectra of the mesons . at midrapidity",
    "the transverse mass @xmath27 of a particle is equivalent to its total energy in the center  of  mass system .",
    "following @xcite , the transverse  mass distribution of particles with mass @xmath28 emitted isotropically from a thermal source is characterized by a boltzmann temperature @xmath29 and , at midrapidity , can be approximately described by    @xmath30    in fig .",

    "ion collisions in the sis  energy regime @xcite .",
    "possible explanations that have been suggested for the low@xmath27 enhancement involve pion rescattering through resonance states in the heavier systems @xcite and multiple pion decay of heavy resonances @xcite .    transverse  mass scaling in the high@xmath27 region does not prove that the fireball actually has reached chemical equilibrium .",
    "the particle spectra of an equilibrated source , however , would follow phase space distributions as observed , at least for vanishing flow .",
    "in our ansatz we assume that at chemical freeze  out the fireball can be described in terms of an ideal , equilibrated hadron gas . as constituents we take into account pions and @xmath4 mesons , as well as nucleons , deuterons , and all non  strange baryon resonances up to a mass of 1.8  gev ( see table [ resonances ] ) , which corresponds to @xmath32 at 2@xmath0  gev beam energy .    in the grand ",

    "[ grandcan ] is related to the fact that the baryon resonances are unstable particles which do not have a fixed mass but exhibit a broad mass distribution .",
    "in contrast to thermal  model analyses of ags and sps data , the actual mass distributions can not be neglected in the 1@xmath0  gev energy regime since here the energy available in the nucleon ",

    "the experimental spectra , however , may be modified by resonance decays and , in particular in heavy systems , by the rescattering of particles off spectator material .",

    "thus , in order to extract the freeze  out temperature @xmath5 from the spectral shapes , further assumptions have to be made leading to model  dependent results . nevertheless , the meson spectra of the present data base do provide a valuable consistency check for the chemical freeze  out analysis in the sense that the different model temperatures are subject to constraints due to the time order of chemical and thermal freeze  out .",

    "all particles in the fireball share a common temperature @xmath105 and have a common radial ",

    "the modification of the spectra compared to pure boltzmann distributions becomes more significant the heavier the considered particle species is .",

    "therefore , a fit to the mesonic transverse ",
    "mass spectra considering both @xmath105 and @xmath106 as free parameters would determine the freeze  out parameters only with large uncertainties .",
    "to avoid this situation , we exploit the fact that for the present range of collision systems @xmath106 is known to have values between 0.25 and 0.35 in accord with the systematics of radial flow velocities measured for heavier particles ( a=1 to 4 ) in central collisions as quoted in @xcite .",
    "thus only @xmath105 is treated as a fit parameter while @xmath106 is kept constant . in the @xmath3 cases",
