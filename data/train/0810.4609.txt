    "the lower bound technique is a useful tool in the ergodic theory of markov processes .",
    "it has been used by doeblin ( see @xcite ) to show mixing of a markov chain whose transition probabilities possess a uniform lower bound .",
    "a somewhat different approach , relying on the analysis of the operator dual to the transition probability , has been applied by lasota and yorke , see , for instance , .",
    "for example , in @xcite , they show that the existence of a lower bound for the iterates of the frobenius  perron operator ( that corresponds to a piecewise monotonic transformation on the unit interval ) implies the existence of a stationary distribution for the deterministic markov chain describing the iterates of the transformation .",
    "in fact , the invariant measure is then unique in the class of measures that are absolutely continuous with respect to one - dimensional lebesgue measure .",
    "it is also statistically stable , that is , the law of the chain , starting from any initial distribution that is absolutely continuous , converges to the invariant measure in the total variation metric .",
    "this technique has been extended to more general markov chains , including those which correspond to iterated function systems ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "however , most of the existing results are formulated for markov chains taking values in finite - dimensional spaces ; see , for example , @xcite for a review of the topic .    generally speaking , the lower bound technique which we have in mind involves deriving ergodic properties of the markov process from the fact that there exists a `` small '' set in the state space .",
    "for instance , it could be compact , such that the time averages of the mass of the process are concentrated over that set for all sufficiently large times .",
    "if this set is compact , then one can deduce the existence of an invariant probability measure without much difficulty .",
    "the question of extending the lower bound technique to markov processes taking values in polish spaces that are not locally compact is quite a delicate matter .",
    "this situation typically occurs for processes that are solutions of stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) .",
    "the value of the process is then usually an element of an infinite - dimensional hilbert or banach space .",
    "we stress here that to prove the existence of a stationary measure , it is not enough only to ensure the lower bound on the transition probability over some `` thin '' set .",
    "one can show ( see the counterexample provided in @xcite ) that even if the mass of the process contained in any neighborhood of a given point is separated from zero for all times , an invariant measure may fail to exist .",
    "in fact , some general results concerning the existence of an invariant measure and its statistical stability for a discrete - time markov chain have been formulated in @xcite ; see theorems 3.13.3 .    in the present paper , we are concerned with the question of finding a criterion for the existence of a unique , invariant , ergodic probability measure for a continuous - time feller markov process @xmath1 taking values in a polish space @xmath2 ; see theorems [ mtheorem ] and [ theorem ] below .",
    "suppose that @xmath3 is its transition probability semigroup .",
    "in our first result ( see theorem [ mtheorem ] ) , we show that there exists a unique , invariant probability measure for the process , provided that for any lipschitz , bounded function  @xmath4 , the family of functions @xmath5 is uniformly continuous at any point of @xmath2 ( we call this the _ e - property _ of the semigroup ) and there exists @xmath6 such that for any @xmath7 , @xmath8 here , @xmath9 denotes the ball in @xmath2 centered at @xmath10 with radius @xmath11 . observe that , in contrast to the doeblin condition , we do not require that the lower bound in ( [ intro-1 ] ) is uniform in the state variable @xmath12 .",
    "if some conditions on uniformity over bounded sets are added [ see ( [ th1 ] ) and ( [ th2 ] ) below ] , then one can also deduce the stability of the ergodic averages corresponding to @xmath1 ; see theorem [ theorem ] .",
    "we call this , after @xcite , _",
    "weak-@xmath0 mean ergodicity .",
    "_ this general result is applied to solutions of stochastic evolution equations in hilbert spaces . in theorem",
    "[ tgeneral ] , we show the uniqueness and ergodicity of an invariant measure , provided that the transition semigroup has the e - property and the ( deterministic ) semi - dynamical system corresponding to the equation without the noise has an attractor which admits a unique invariant measure . this is a natural generalization of the results known for so - called _ dissipative systems _ ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "a different approach to proving the uniqueness of an invariant measure for a stochastic evolution equation is based on the strong feller property of the transition semigroup ( see @xcite and @xcite ) or , in a more refined form , on _ the asymptotic strong feller property _ ( see @xcite ) . in our theorem",
    "[ tgeneral ] , we do not require either of these properties of the corresponding semigroup . roughly speaking , we assume : ( 1 ) the existence of a global compact attractor for the system without the noise [ hypothesis ( i ) ] ; ( 2 ) the existence of a lyapunov function [ hypothesis  ( ii ) ] ; ( 3 ) some form of stochastic stability of the system after the noise is added [ hypothesis  ( iii ) ] ; ( 4 ) the e - property ( see section [ sec2 ] ) .",
    "this allows us to show lower bounds for the transition probabilities and then use theorems [ mtheorem ] and [ theorem ] .    as an application of theorem [ tgeneral ] , we consider , in sections [ observable - section ] and [ sec5 ] , the lagrangian observation process corresponding to the passive tracer model @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a time  space stationary random , gaussian and markovian velocity field .",
    "one can show that when the field is sufficiently regular [ see ( [ h1 ] ) ] , the process @xmath15 is a solution of a certain evolution equation in a hilbert space ; see ( [ zet ] ) below .",
    "with the help of the technique developed by hairer and mattingly @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) , we verify the assumptions of theorem [ tgeneral ] when @xmath14 is periodic in the @xmath12 variable and satisfies a mixing hypothesis in the temporal variable ; see ( [ h2 ] ) .",
    "the latter reflects , physically , quite a natural assumption that the mixing time for the velocity field gets shorter on smaller spatial scales . as a consequence of the statistical stability property of the ergodic invariant measure for the lagrangian velocity @xmath16",
    ", we obtain the weak law of large numbers for the passive tracer model in a compressible environment ; see theorem [ ttracer ] .",
