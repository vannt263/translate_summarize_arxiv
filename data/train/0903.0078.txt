    "the unusual and rather remarkable transport properties of graphene continue to attract considerable attention .",
    "soon after its experimental discovery  @xcite , studies found : unconventional quantum hall effect  @xcite ; the possibility of testing the klein paradox  @xcite ; specular andreev reflection and josephson effect  @xcite ; new electric field effects  @xcite ; intriguing electron lensing  @xcite ; and other fascinating phenomena ( see , e.g. , recent papers  @xcite and references therein ) . studies of graphene are also inspired by their potential application in nano - electronic devices , since an applied electric field can vary considerably the electron concentration and have both electrons and holes as charge carriers with high mobility .",
    "the subject of the present study , which is a logical continuation of recent work  @xcite , is an unusual novel transport effect , namely , _",
    "voltage - driven _",
    "quantum oscillations in the conductance of a single - layer gated graphene .",
    "these oscillations originate from a new type of electron states in graphene .",
    "when a graphene sheet is subject to nearby gates , these create an energy barrier for propagating electrons . here",
    "we explicitly demonstrate that , in contrast to non - relativistic quantum mechanics , where localized states can exist only inside quantum wells , dirac - like _ relativistic _ electrons in graphene allow energy states localized _ within the barrier_. we show that the energy @xmath0 of the localized states ( versus the wave vector component @xmath1 along the barrier ) becomes _ non - monotonic _ if @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the barrier height and width correspondingly , and @xmath5 is the fermi velocity .",
    "this produces singularities in the density of localized states for energies where @xmath6 when the magnitude and/or width of the barrier changes , the locations of the singularities move and periodically cross the fermi level , generating quantum oscillations in the _ longitudinal _ ( along the barrier ) conductance as well as in the thermodynamic properties of graphene .",
    "this situation resembles the well known physical mechanism for shubnikov - de - haas ( sdh ) magneto - oscillations ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "indeed , electrons in the conduction band of a 3d metal subject to a strong magnetic field have an equidistant discrete energy levels ( landau levels ) separated by the cyclotron energy .",
    "the corresponding density of states has singularities at the landau levels . when the magnetic field is changed , the positions of the landau levels move and pass periodically through the fermi energy . as a result of this , the population of electrons at the fermi level also changes periodically , giving rise to the quantum oscillations of both the transport and thermodynamic properties of a metal .",
    "one should notice , however , a few important differences .",
    "first , in the context of gated graphene , oscillations are induced by the _",
    "electric _ field , while the corresponding sdh oscillations are driven by a _ magnetic _ field .",
    "second , localized energy states in graphene are non - equidistant and the resulting density of states has a rather complicated energy dependence .",
    "thus , the corresponding oscillations in the conductance inherit all these unusual peculiarities .",
    "the tunneling of relativistic particles in graphene _ across _ a finite - width potential barrier , and its corresponding conductance , has been recently studied ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "we consider another conduction problem , namely , electron waves that propagate _ strictly along _ the barrier and _ damp away from it_. more specifically , we consider electron states in graphene with a potential barrier located in a single - layer graphene occupying the @xmath7-plane ( see fig .",

    "it is worth emphasizing that each of the branches with positive energy has a maximum @xmath48 at a certain wave number @xmath49 . near these points",
    "the group velocity of localized electron waves tends to zero , which resembles the stop - light phenomena found in various media  @xcite .",
    "the localized states can also be observed in graphene when a voltage is applied to produce a potential well  @xcite .",
    "note that defect - induced localized electron states in graphene and the enhancement of conductivity due to an increase of the electron density of states localized near the graphene edges were recently reported  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these examples , the electron states studied here are localized within the barrier and also these _ are tunable _ ,",
    "i.e. , the energy levels can be shifted by charging the barrier strength ( e.g. , via tuning a gate voltage ) .     and @xmath50 . the dirac sea of delocalized states ( continuum spectrum ) is marked by the grey regions .",
