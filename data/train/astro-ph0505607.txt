    "the model of the large - scale matter distribution consisting of haloes with power - law profile _ and _ with centers distributed randomly can be traced back to peebles @xcite .",
    "mcclelland & silk @xcite and later sheth & jain @xcite and murante et al @xcite studied the effect on correlation functions of a spectrum of halo masses .",
    "the latter authors claimed that this model provides a good description of the observed galaxy correlations , at least on small scales .",
    "in particular , their analysis of generalized correlation integrals shows non - trivial scaling , which they consider indistinguishable from the scaling in fractal models .",
    "recently , this conclusion has led botaccio , montuori and pietronero @xcite to construct new statistical functions to distinguish both types of models .    motivated by the mentioned preceding works , here we critically examine the model of randomly distributed haloes with power - law profile .",
    "we instead propose a model consisting of a set of fractal distributions of haloes , that is , combining both the fractal and the halo models .",
    "actually , murante et al already considered to place the haloes `` more deliberately , for instance in the sheet - like structures produced by large - scale pancake formation '' but deferred it to future work . here ,",
    "we constructively proceed from the case of a single halo , understood as a _ degenerate _ multifractal model , to a general multifractal , considered as a set of fractal distributions of haloes .",
    "we argue that this model is plausible in regard to models of structure formation and provides a better description , especially , of _ void _ regions .",
    "furthermore , we show that it is supported by the multifractal analysis of @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "we also discuss the rle of the two - point correlation function in this context .    the halo model of large - scale structure , to be discussed further below ,",
    "is now well developed @xcite .",
    "actually , clustering in the distribution of haloes has been studied by mo & white @xcite and sheth & tormen @xcite .",
    "however , there is no study within the multifractal formalism yet ( the paper by murante et al @xcite relates haloes with multifractals but is restricted to randomly distributed haloes ) .",
    "the advantage of this study is that it unveils the scaling properties and , in particular , allows us to deeply relate halo and fractal models .",
    "the standard magnitude used to describe fractals is the number - radius function @xmath1 , defined as the average number of points in a ball of radius @xmath2 centred on a point : it must be a power law , namely , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the fractal dimension . as a generalization of fractal distributions ,",
    "multifractal measures represent mass distributions spread according to highly irregular patterns , so that a local density fails to exist .",
    "in fact , a multifractal measure is locally such that , in a ball of radius @xmath2 centred on a point @xmath5 , @xmath6 \\sim r^\\a$ ] , where the lipschitz - hlder exponent @xmath7 takes on a range of values @xcite . for @xmath8 the local density fails to exist , that is , there is no @xmath9/r^3 $ ] ( it is divergent ) . on the other hand , for a differentiable distribution @xmath6 \\sim r^3 $ ] , so @xmath10 and the density is @xmath11/(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3)$ ] .",
    "let us see how this definition applies to a differentiable distribution given by a single power law of the radius from a given point in space ( placed at the origin ) , namely , @xmath12 .",
    "this distribution is differentiable at every point except the origin , which is a singularity .",
    "note that if @xmath13 then @xmath6 \\sim r^{3}$ ] , whereas at the origin @xmath14 \\sim r^{3-\\b}.$ ] the mass function @xmath15 , namely , the average of the mass in a ball of radius @xmath2 is @xmath16 % \\nonumber\\\\ =   \\int d^3x \\,{x}^{- \\beta } \\int_{b({\\bf x},r ) } d^3s\\ ,           { \\left|{\\bm x } +   { \\bm s } \\right|}^{-\\beta } , \\label{mr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have to integrate over a finite region to have finite total mass ( for example , with an @xmath17 cutoff ) .",
    "this also renders @xmath15 finite , for there is no divergence at @xmath18 . the function @xmath15",
    "can actually be computed in terms of trascendental functions , but this is not necessary , because only the behaviour of @xmath15 in the limit of @xmath19 is needed .",
    "therefore , in the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ mr ] ) only two cases occur : either @xmath13 or @xmath20 ( the singularity ) . in the first case ,",
    "the integral over @xmath21 in the @xmath19 limit yields @xmath22 .",
    "in contrast , to calculate the integral at @xmath20 , we must perform the limit @xmath23 before the limit @xmath19 .",
    "the result is approximately @xmath24 .",
    "note that this quantity coincides with @xmath14 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "we conclude that if @xmath25 the behaviour of @xmath15 in the limit of @xmath19 is @xmath26 but if @xmath27 the behaviour is instead @xmath28 and is dominated by the singularity .",
    "an important remark is that , in the case dominated by the singularity , the value of the density @xmath29 at regular points ( @xmath13 ) is irrelevant and the result is therefore _",
    "independent _ of its power - law form at those points .",
    "we can consider a single power - law singularity as an example of multifractal @xcite . in a generic multifractal",
    "the measure is concentrated in a set of vanishing lebesgue measure , so that in almost every point there is no measure .",
    "the distribution of the measure is characterized by the _ multifractal spectrum _ , which can be calculated from the moment sums @xmath30^q$ ] ( generalized correlation integrals ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath31 is equivalent to @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ mr ] ) .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath32 , the more important is the contribution of the most singular points to the corresponding moment sum , and it can happen that only a few points ( or a single one ) contribute from some @xmath32 upwards .",
    "the multifractal spectrum @xmath33 is the function that gives the fractal dimension of the set of points with exponent @xmath7 , and can be calculated from the moments @xmath34 ( @xmath19 ) .    for a distribution with _",
    "one _ singularity with exponent @xmath35 and regular with positive density everywhere else , the singularity contribution is @xmath14^q \\sim r^{q(3-\\b)}$ ] and the regular point contribution @xmath6^q \\sim r^{3(q-1)}$ ] .",
    "therefore , if @xmath36 then @xmath37 and if @xmath38 then @xmath39 .",
    "this _ degenerate _ multifractal spectrum can be derived in the standard way through the function @xmath40 such that @xmath41 .",
    "we have that @xmath42 if @xmath43 and @xmath44 if @xmath38 , corresponding to @xmath10 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "they yield the fractal dimensions of the singular set @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , as expected .",
    "a generic multifractal is singular in an uncountable set of points ( of vanishing lebesgue measure ) .",
    "however , we can have intermediate cases , namely , distributions differentiable everywhere except in a set with  many \" points and , furthermore , such that the measure is a power - law near every singular point .",
    "it is crucial what meaning we shall attribute to the word  many \" .",
    "if the set of singularities is finite , then each one is isolated .",
    "if there is a common exponent , no novelties arise .",
    "otherwise , depending on each singularity s strength , as given by its exponent , @xmath40 undergoes crossovers as @xmath32 increases , which can mimick a continuous variation .",
    "however , this type of multifractal is still degenerate and , in addition , @xmath33 jumps from 3 to 0 at once .",
    "all this applies to the model of randomly - placed power - law haloes @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the generalization to a distribution that is almost everywhere regular but with power - law singularities in a fractal set .",
    "let us assume same strength singularities ( common exponent @xmath35 , @xmath48 ) and everywhere non - vanishing density .",
    "a careless generalization of the case with a finite singularity set would make us believe that the multifractal spectrum is not altered and still @xmath42 if @xmath43 and @xmath49 if @xmath38 ( corresponding to @xmath10 and @xmath50 , respectively ) . however , this is now inconsistent , for it yields the fractal dimension of the singular set @xmath51 , contrary to the assumption .",
    "so @xmath52 for @xmath38 .",
    "in fact , given that @xmath53 , @xmath7 constant only implies that @xmath54 , with @xmath55 being some arbitrary constant .",
    "furthermore , @xmath56 , so any dimension of the fractal singularity set @xmath57 is allowed .",
    "assuming @xmath40 continuous , its change of behaviour takes place at @xmath58 , smaller than for a finite number of singularities of common strength ( but larger than unity ) .",
    "the reason for the smaller value of @xmath40 for @xmath59 is that almost every point of a fractal is an accumulation point ( because isolated points do not contribute to the fractal dimension ) , so the singularities are enhanced .",
    "summarizing , the generalization from a finite set of common strength singularities to a dimension-@xmath4 fractal set of common strength singularities leads to a crossover at smaller @xmath32 ( @xmath60 ) and with smaller ( more singular ) @xmath61 .",
    "a crossover between just two exponents @xmath7 ( one of which may be the trivial @xmath62 or not ) corresponds to a _",
    "bifractal_. arguments for bifractal distributions of matter in cosmology have been given by balian and schaeffer @xcite , and borgani @xcite has shown that these distributions can be derived from the generalized thermodynamical model .",
    "we can have several values of the exponent @xmath7 , like in the case of a finite singularity set .",
    "therefore , we can have several crossovers , defining a multifractal spectrum degenerate by pieces .",
    "let us consider the definition @xmath63 , and the entropy dimension @xmath64 , which defines the set of the measure s concentrate .",
    "a monofractal is most degenerate , in the sense that there is only one @xmath7 , such that @xmath65 , of course .",
    "there are less degenerate cases in which @xmath66 is constant by pieces . in them",
    "the measure s concentrate still has @xmath65 , but the other fractal sets with constant @xmath7 have @xmath67 . to probe these sets one has to measure moments with the appropriate @xmath32 s .    of course ,",
    "a multifractal spectrum degenerate by pieces approaches a non - degenerate one as the number of pieces grows and the exponent @xmath66 becomes continuous .",
    "usual physical mechanisms that generate singularities produce this type of spectrum .",
    "for example , the set of singularities of a mass distribution may be determined by some random process , such as the maxima of fractional brownian motion .",
    "models of this type are relevant in the context of the halo model of large - scale structure .",
    "the halo model of large - scale structure takes its inspiration from old ideas on gravitational clustering of matter and also from the analysis of @xmath0-body simulations @xcite .",
    "it assumes that the dark matter is in the form of collapsed and virialized haloes with definite density profile .",
    "this profile is usually taken to have spherical symmetry around the halo centre ( with small deviations ) , with a given radial profile .",
    "this radial profile can adopt several forms , the simplest one being a power law @xmath68    complementary to the profile is the distribution of halo centres . of course , it is simpler to consider a finite number of well - separated randomly - distributed haloes , but the usual mechanisms for large - scale structure formation produce an infinite number , unless a _",
    "lower cutoff _ is introduced .",
    "this lower cutoff may appear as a softening of the gravitational force or as a minimal mass ( both are present in @xmath0-body simulations ) .",
    "a lower cutoff prevents infinite clustering on small scales but nonetheless preserves clustering on larger scales .",
    "let us focus on two models of large - scale structure formation , namely , the spherical collapse model and the adhesion model .    the spherical collapse model can be formulated in several ways ; we here consider the formulation that takes the peaks of the initial gaussian density field as seeds for the formation of haloes , so the number of haloes is directly determined by these peaks , although the spatial distribution and final halo masses depend on the ensuing dynamics .",
    "this nonlinear dynamics is complex but nonetheless enhances clustering . in any event ,",
    "the set of peaks of a gaussian density field is _ dense _ , so the assumption of a finite number of haloes is clearly insufficient .",
    "arguably , this dense set of points becomes a set of fractals under the nonlinear dynamics , but this model does not allow to conclude much more without further assumptions on that nonlinear dynamics .    the adhesion model @xcite provides us with a concrete nonlinear equation and methods to study the evolution of an initial gaussian density field @xcite .",
    "actually , the evidence suggests the development of a distribution with multifractal features .",
    "it consists of a self - similar distribution of caustics : pancakes , filaments and nodes .",
    "unfortunately , this model only covers the early stages of structure formation , before the virialization of haloes , which are supposed to arise essentially from the caustic nodes .",
    "the resulting distribution is probably similar to what murante et al @xcite had in mind as singularities `` placed more deliberately , for instance in the sheet - like structures produced by large - scale pancake formation '' .",
    "since the theoretical models of large - scale structure formation are insufficient to fully determine the structure and distribution of haloes , we may turn to @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "in fact , a good deal of evidence for the halo model comes from them .",
    "however , discretization issues tend to make the conclusions less certain .",
    "for example , the inevitable smoothing length that is introduced in the gravitational interaction suppresses clustering on smaller scales , so that the smoothness of haloes may be just a consequence of it rather than a consequence of the gravitational dynamics . at any rate ,",
    "the smoothness of haloes is questionable and there is evidence for a hierarchical structure of condensations , similar to a multifractal @xcite .",
    "multifractal analyses of large - scale structure were first introduced regarding the distribution of galaxies @xcite and later applied to @xmath0-body simulations @xcite , with positive results . however , the relationship of these results with haloes and their distribution is far from clear .",
    "one way to clarify this relationship is to give a definition of haloes suitable for @xmath0-body simulations and then analyse their spatial distribution . in a multifractal model , haloes",
    "must be identified with density singularities , but there are no real singularities in @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "one can define a coarse - grained density and consider density peaks as singularities , in accord with _ coarse multifractal analysis _ @xcite .",
    "then one can measure the strength of singularities and analyse the distributions of singularities of similar strength , to assess their fractality .",
    "this is an alternative ( or rather complementary ) procedure to the computation of moments and hence the multifractal spectrum @xmath33 .",
    "we have applied this new picture of multifractal models to @xmath0-body cosmological simulations by the virgo consortium ; in particular , we have taken the @xmath69 positions of the @xmath70cdm gif2 simulation , with @xmath71 particles in a volume of ( 110 @xmath72 mpc)@xmath73 @xcite .",
    "to measure the strength of singularities , we use a spatial window , for several window lengths . to simplify matters ,",
    "we select two different singularity strengths , corresponding to two different halo masses ( at definite window length ) ; hence we classify the haloes in heavy and light haloes , in a sort of bifractal .",
    "if we were to identify haloes as the places of galaxy formation , this selection would roughly correspond to two types of galaxies that have been used in connection with voids in the galaxy distribution , namely , `` wall '' and `` field '' galaxies .",
    "results of an analysis with window length @xmath74 appear in fig .",
    "[ figs2 ] : on the left - hand side , there is a slice showing both halo populations , consisting of 2508 and 25556 members , with 750 to 1000 particles and with 100 to 150 particles , respectively . on the right - hand side",
    ", we have log - log plots of the number - radius functions for the respective spatial distributions of halo centers .",
    "they have scaling ranges corresponding to quite different fractal dimensions , namely , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we have also carried out the analysis of moments and derived the multifractal spectrum .",
    "it yields entropy dimension @xmath77 and shows that the values of the fractal dimensions @xmath78 and @xmath79 in fig .",
    "[ figs2 ] correspond ( approximately ) to @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and to @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "these noninteger values are relatively close to the integer @xmath84 , associated with the two - point correlation function .",
    "the role of the various @xmath85 and , in particular , of @xmath86 is further discussed below .",
    "we can observe that the light haloes are somewhat clustered , as corresponds to a fractal of dimension @xmath87 .",
    "in fact , more uniform distributions can be found for even lighter haloes , and the most uniform distribution corresponds to the largest fractal dimension , namely , @xmath88 .",
    "the estimation of @xmath88 is affected by the problem of undersampling , especially for small window length .",
    "however , it seems that @xmath89 is already reached for values of the window length @xmath90 , that is , well within the scaling range .",
    "indeed , in the scale range @xmath91@xmath92 we have a stable multifractal spectrum .",
    "note that these scales correspond to physical length @xmath93@xmath94 mpc , larger than the size of virialized haloes .",
    "we remark that @xmath95 , such that the distribution at the corresponding points is regular with vanishing density .",
    "so there are no haloes at those points , which actually belong to voids .",
    "the set of regular points with non - vanishing density corresponds to @xmath10 and @xmath96 , which is nearly homogeneous .",

    "we have seen , in a model of the large - scale matter distribution consisting of randomly placed haloes with power - law profile , that the power - law form of correlation functions as @xmath19 is due to the singularities of the power - law distribution , rather than to its regular part .",
    "we have also seen that it is only a particular and degenerate case of a multifractal distribution . while a suitable spectrum of singularity strengths can reproduce the scalings observed in the galaxy distribution @xcite , underdense regions are necessarily homogenous and there are no voids . therefore , we consider the generalization to a multifractal model consisting of a set of fractal distributions of power - law haloes .",
    "a degenerate model with a set of discrete singularity strengths is useful conceptually and to analyse @xmath0-body simulations .",

    "we remark that these two values span the usual range of fractal dimensions of the galaxy distribution .    as to the rle of the two - point correlation",
    ", it is certainly not sufficient to fully characterize the scaling properties of the dark matter distribution and one has to study higher order correlations .",
    "this is characteristic of multifractals , which are defined by the full set of moments @xmath34 for @xmath100 , as opposed to pure fractals , defined only by @xmath31 ( in fact , by @xmath101 , with any @xmath32 ) . in addition , we remark that the singular nature of multifractals implies that the moments with @xmath102 are not sufficient .",
    "the restriction to these moments amounts to considering a multifractal degenerate by pieces , but with an inadequate division .",
    "in fact , most important is @xmath103 , because the entropy dimension @xmath64 defines the set of the measure s concentrate .",
    "larger @xmath32 s are also relevant but very little information is actually gathered from moments with @xmath104 ( in current @xmath0-body simulations ) .",
    "negative-@xmath32 moments are relevant as well , but not in connection with haloes but with voids . at any rate ,",
    "if we focus on a uniform set of haloes , namely , on a definite set of singularities with similar strength , the two - point correlation function of their centers provides the necessary information for its scaling properties . since this is true for every set of singularities , the corresponding set of two - point correlation functions defines the scaling properties of the full distribution .",
    "precisely this is the basis of the picture of the full distribution as a set of fractal distributions of haloes that we propose .",
