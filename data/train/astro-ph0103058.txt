    "this suggests that some of the discrepancy between the observed spectral index and the spectral index which is predicted from the decay of the optical and @xmath14-ray light curves may be due to the time evolution of the oa s spectrum that result from changes in the amount of dust along the line of sight to the burst during the first few days after the burst .",
