    "in dynamical systems , the study of semigroup actions , in other words , iterated function systems ( ifss ) , are interesting subjects not only in themselves , but also from the viewpoint of study of systems generated by a single map .",
    "for example , in the study of properties of dynamically defined invariant sets , such as the unstable manifold of a hyperbolic set , a difficulty comes from the point that they often exhibit complicated fractal structures .",
    "a natural and powerful way to analyze them is to reduce the original system to ifss , which enables us to command the deep theories developed in fractal geometry ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there is another motivation of this kind .",
    "it comes from their relationship with partially hyperbolic systems , which also attracts the attention of recent research .",
    "one typical example of such systems is given by skew product systems of ifss ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus study of ifss are expected to contribute to the study of partially hyperbolic systems .",
    "it is true that skew product systems are  too clean \" compared to general partially hyperbolic systems : the regularity of the holonomies among fibers in general systems is very low , while in skew product systems it is given by the identity map .",
    "nonetheless , the study of ifss from this viewpoint would contribute to the study of partially hyperbolic systems to offer a  first step \" of investigations of such kind .",
    "there are many researches to this direction , in particular under the setting where the ambient space is a one dimensional manifold ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "very recently , under some generic assumptions ,  spectral decomposition theorems for ifss \" were established by several researchers ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "thus the next natural question would be to investigate the properties of each `` basic pieces '' that appear in such decompositions .",
    "one interesting thing in relation to this decomposition is that it is reported that if the systems has good regularity , then there are strange restrictions on them .",
    "the aim of this article is to obtain a better understanding about such restrictions .    to explain the strange restrictions , we restrict our attention to a special setting .",
    "let @xmath2 $ ] and @xmath3 be continuous maps satisfying the following conditions :    * @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "* for @xmath6 , @xmath7 and for @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "* @xmath10 , @xmath11 are orientation preserving homeomorphisms on their images .",
    "we denote the set of pairs of @xmath12 satisfying conditions above by @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , we denote the set of @xmath12 such that @xmath14 are @xmath1-diffeomorphisms on their images satisfying @xmath15 by @xmath16 . under this setting , we are interested in the property of _ forward minimal sets _ of semigroup actions on @xmath17 generated by @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "a non - empty set @xmath18 is called a _ ( forward ) minimal set _ if for every point in @xmath19 , the forward orbit is dense in @xmath19 .",
    "we say that a semigroup action is _ minimal _ if the ambient space itself is a minimal set , in other words , every point has a dense orbit .",
    "the reason why we assigned @xmath14 the above conditions is that this is the `` simplest '' case for the study of minimal set .",
    "the importance of the minimal set comes from the fact that they corresponds to homoclinic classes in the ambient space ( see section [ s.basic ] for detail ) .    in @xcite , the following property proved by duminy",
    "is discussed ( see also section 3.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "[ p.dum ] if @xmath12 are sufficiently @xmath0-close to the identity , the forward minimal set of @xmath12-action is equal to @xmath17 . in other words ,",
    "every point has a dense orbit .",
    "the aim of this paper is to consider the similar problem under the @xmath1-topology .",
    "the conclusion is that in @xmath1 case , we can construct a counterexample .",
    "more precisely , we prove the following .",
    "there exists a sequence @xmath20 converging to @xmath21 in the @xmath1-topology such that @xmath22 has minimal set that does not equal to @xmath17 .",
    "let us discuss the importance of the closeness to the identity map in the assumption of the theorem .",
    "the first importance is that it examines a shared intuition that  a groups generated by elements close to the identity have nice structures \" ( for example see section 3.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "the result of duminy says that such an intuition is valid under our context ( for there is a uniformity on the shape of minimal set .",
    ") meanwhile , our theorem says that the @xmath1-closeness is not enough to guarantee the intuition above with respect to the shape of the minimal set .",
    "the second importance is from their relationship with partially hyperbolic systems .",
    "consider an ifs whose skew product is not uniformly hyperbolic to the center direction .",
    "then we expect that there would be some regions where the central direction has lyapnov exponents with small absolute values . the condition that the dynamics are close to the identity are naturally satisfied in such regions",
    ". thus , we can interpret proposition [ p.dum ] to mean that the homoclinic classes in such bifurcation regions can not be small ( the projection always become intervals ) . indeed",
    ", there are several results which seems to reflect this principle .",
    "for example , in the proof of @xcite , one important step to prove the finitude of srb measures is showing that  the support of ergodic measures which exhibits weak hyperbolicity to central direction is always large , \" see the introduction of @xcite . from this viewpoint",
    ", our theorem can be regarded as a negative circumstantial evidence for the validity of corresponding result under the @xmath1-topology .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "let us give some comments on the proof of theorem .",
    "the above theorem gives a sequence of examples of non - minimal semigroup actions .",
    "thus it is natural to ask the finer information of the minimal sets , such as hausdorff dimension or topology of them .",
    "the only thing our proof tells is that they do not contain several intervals . to calculate hausdorff dimension or decide a topology",
    ", it seems that our argumen is not enough .",
    "so we do not touch this problem in this article .    the proof is done by mixture of elementary combinatorial and analytic arguments . in the earlier stage of this research",
    "the author found some inspiration from papers such as @xcite , but most of the arguments in this paper are independent from them . since he can not find adequate reference for the basic facts used in this article , in section 2 we prepare basic definitions and furnish the proof of basic facts .",
    "* contents * in section 2 , we give the definitions of basic notions and give proofs of basic facts . in section 3",
    ", we explain the strategy of our construction .",
    "the proof consists of two parts : construction of  three kind of parts \" of dynamical systems and assembly of them . assuming the existence of such parts",
    ", we also give the argument of assembly in section 3 .",
    "in section 4 , we prepare some combinatorial arguments . in section 5 and 6 , we prove the existence of two parts called runway and connector . in section 7 , 8 , and 9 , we prove the existence of the quantum leap , which completes the whole argument .    *",

    "this comes from the fact that being a hiding region can be decided only from the information of the boundary points ( which is finite ) of @xmath77 .",

    "a very rough idea of proposition [ p.exquant ] is that `` if two rational numbers @xmath264 are very close , then there exists @xmath265-quantum leap with non - trivial hiding regions . ''",
    "indeed , this statement sounds quite plausible , since in the case @xmath266 , it is very easy to find non - trivial attracting regions ( take any non - trivial sub interval contained in the fundamental domain ) .",

    "the meaning of smallness depends on not only the absolute difference between @xmath267 and @xmath268 , but also the denominator of @xmath267 and @xmath268 in irreducible representations ( remember that it governs the size of fundamental domains ) .    in general",

    "2 .   @xmath12 has a hiding region @xmath247 which is periodic on the left translation area with period @xmath275 and on the right translation area with period @xmath276 .",
    "this proposition is more general since there is less restrictions on the choice of @xmath277 .",
    "however , the proof of this proposition requires more elaboration .",
    "thus in this article we only furnish the proof of proposition [ p.exquant ] .",
    "on the other hand , the proof of proposition [ p.omitted ] seems to have broader possibility of further application for the statement itself and the proof has more intuitive , geometric flavors .",
    "so the author is thinking of presenting it in another place .",
    "finally , we would like to point out the following . by virtue of farey series",
    ", we could prove proposition [ p.goodrat ] in a simple way .",
    "meanwhile , it is worth mentioning that the proof has some relationship with diophantine approximation theory .",
    "for example , if we change the denominator in the right hand side of the inequality in [ p.goodrat ] to @xmath278 , then the corresponding statement is false for sufficiently small @xmath253 .",

    "which is naturally homeomorphic to @xmath58 ) , we can naturally define a new dynamical systems which was the glued map of runway and the connector .",
    "finally , we take the projection of the hiding regions to this quotient space from the old ones : this turns to be a region in the new space and we can check that this is a hiding region for new dynamics ( this is why we needed the  margin \" ) .",
    "note that this construction does not change the value of @xmath279 .",
    "we continue this construction : paste the one above with quantum leap @xmath321 , then paste it with @xmath322 , and continue this process to obtain a dynamics @xmath157 with hiding region @xmath323 which is @xmath54-periodic on the right translation area with its symmetric with respect to @xmath324 .",
    "remember that the size of the translation of @xmath325 is @xmath54 and of @xmath326 is @xmath327 .",
    "furthermore , now we pick up the  mirror image \" of @xmath157 .",
