    "in behavioral sciences , evolutionary biology and more recently in economics , understanding conditions for the emergence and maintenance of cooperative behavior among unrelated and selfish individuals becomes a central issue  @xcite . in the investigation of this problem ,",
    "the most popular framework is game theory together with its extensions involving evolutionary context  @xcite .",
    "the public goods game ( pgg ) , which attracted much attention from economists , is a general paradigm to explain cooperative behavior through group interactions  @xcite .",
    "the pgg model is characterised by groups of cooperators doing better than groups of defectors , but defectors always outperforming the cooperators in their group .",
    "in typical examples , the individual contributions are multiplied by a factor @xmath0 and then divided equally among all players . with @xmath0 smaller than the group size , this is an example of a social dilemma : every individual player is better off defecting than cooperating , no matter what the other players do .",
    "groups would therefore consist of defectors only and forego the public good .",
    "considerable efforts have been concentrated on exploration of the origin and persistence of cooperation . during the last decades , five rules ,",
    "namely , kin selection  @xcite , direct reciprocity  @xcite , indirect reciprocity  @xcite , network ( or spatial ) reciprocity  @xcite , and group selection  @xcite , have been found to benefit the evolution of cooperation in biological and ecological systems as well as within human societies ( for a review , see  @xcite ) . in realistic systems , most interactions among elements",
    "are spatially localised , which makes spatial or graph models more meaningful . unlike the other four rules , spatial games ( _ i.e. _ , network reciprocity ) can lead to cooperative behavior in the absence of any strategic complexity  @xcite . in spatial evolutionary pgg , the cooperators can survive by forming compact clusters , which minimizes the exploitation by defectors  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , szab and hauert _",
    "et  al . _",
    "have recently discussed the effects of compulsory and voluntary interactions of players in evolutionary pgg , with the structured populations bound to regular lattices  @xcite as well as with the well - mixed population  @xcite .",
    "the factors such as the voluntary participation  @xcite , and small density of population  @xcite , are found to be capable of boosting cooperation .",
    "more recently , huang _ et  al .",
    "_ have proposed an extended public goods interaction model to study the evolution of cooperation in heterogeneous population , and proved that scale - free networks of contacts can lead to more competitive cooperation  @xcite .    in real world",
    ", people always wish to make decisions based on a comprehensive knowledge of the pertinent background , such as the historical performance of each alternative choice  @xcite , which they may obtain by learning from people they are regarding .",
    "however , the limited eyereach or capacity of humans actually exists and induces the unperfect communication .",
    "one can merely learn from a small set of people ( corresponding to the so - called `` role models '' in the context of cultural evolution  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , these role models rarely can be extended over the whole population , but localised to the learner s `` vicinity '' , which abstractly implies the people having similar characteristics as the learner ( such as religious background , age , education , lifestyle , or social class ) that in favour of building up mutual communication .    as a natural extension of those aforementioned factors ,",
    "an new intriguing task is to understand how the limitation of communication capacity of people influences the cooperative behavior in real world . in this letter",
    ", we will study a spatially extended pgg on two - layered graphs , where one layer especially depicts the communication among players , with the aim to find out how the evolution of cooperation depends on the players communications .",
    "in spatial game models , the players occupying the sites of a graph can follow one of the two pure strategies , cooperation ( @xmath1 ) or defection ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "there are two types of contacts among players in the evolutionary process : players collect payoffs from their neighbours by playing games with them  @xcite , and then update strategies by learning from neighbours .",
    "thus , the graph occupied by the players can be split into two layers , an interaction layer and a learning ( communication ) layer  @xcite .",
    "the former one defines the interaction neighbourhood ( in ) , _ i.e. _ , who plays game with whom .",
    "the latter one specifies learning neighbourhood ( ln ) for evolutionary updating or , in other words , defines who - is - the - role - model - of - whom .    in our model ,",
    "the in layer where players have public goods interactions is a @xmath3 square lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the group size of the interaction neighbours in the pgg therefore is @xmath4 .",
    "the score achieved in pgg interactions denotes the reproductive success , _ i.e. _ , the probability that other players will adopt the player s strategy .",
    "this score is assumed to be determined merely by a single , typical pgg involving the player and its four nearest interaction neighbours  @xcite .",
    "thus the payoff of one player @xmath5 is , @xmath6 where @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 ) denote , respectively , the number of participants choosing @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , and @xmath10 denotes the strategy of player @xmath5 .",
    "the cooperative investments are normalised to unity and @xmath0 specifies the multiplication factor on the public goods .    after each round of the game interactions , for the reference of the strategy update , each player communicates with its role models ( neighbours in the ln layer ) , inquiring the individual information such as the payoff and the strategy .",
    "the player s capacity of communication can be measured by how many and how far away the role models it can selected . in order to regulate this capacity ,",
    "we introduce the ln layer as a variant of the two - dimensional small - world network  @xcite , in which connections to further neighbours occur with a tunable power law probability .",
    "this network is constructed by adding shortcuts among the sites on a @xmath3 square lattice . with periodic boundary condition ,",
    "the lattice distance between two sites @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be written in a two - dimensional fashion as @xmath13 with @xmath14 this value is actually the length of the shortest path connecting these two sites through only lattice links .",
    "each site is additionally linked to @xmath15 other sites  @xcite by shortcuts ( excluding its original nearest neighbours ) .",
    "following the idea of kleinberg  @xcite , those other sites are selected in a biased manner : the probability that site @xmath16 is selected to be linked to site @xmath17 by one shortcut depends on the lattice distance between them in the following way , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a positive exponent and @xmath20 is a normalization factor . obviously , the probability that @xmath5 and @xmath21 are connected is @xmath22    for this network , when @xmath23 , it reduces to the small - world model with random shortcuts  @xcite .",
    "as @xmath19 increases , one site s shortcuts will be clustered in its vicinity and two distant sites are less likely to be connected . here ,",
    "the multiple or self - connected edges are not allowed .",
    "such a network has @xmath24 shortcuts and an average degree @xmath25 .",
    "figure  [ figle ] shows the average lattice length of the shortcuts @xmath26 , and the clustering coefficient @xmath27 of this kind graph .",
    "we clearly notice the increase of @xmath27 with @xmath19 by reason of the clustered shortcuts .    in this paper , we just consider this kind network as the ln of the game players where merely the information flow takes place . in this ln network , the neighbours linked by one edge act as the role model of each other via mutual communication , and the degree of each site corresponds to the amount of role models each player has .",
    "for the sake of convenience , we call those role models introduced by shortcuts the * additional role models * ( shortly arms ) . thus ,",
    "each player has @xmath28 arms on average .",
    "also , the biased effect of nonzero @xmath19 , giving rise to the clustering of shortcuts , can be understood as the `` localization '' of players communication .",
    "following previous studies  @xcite , the evolution of the present system is governed by random sequential strategy adoptions , that is , the randomly chosen player @xmath5 adopts one of its ( randomly chosen ) role model @xmath21 s strategy with a probability depending on the payoff difference @xmath29=\\frac{1}{1+exp\\{[p(i)-p(j)+\\tau]/\\kappa\\}},\\label{wupdate}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 denotes the cost of strategy change , and @xmath31 characterises the noise introduced to permit irrational choices . for @xmath32 the neighbouring strategy @xmath33",
    "is adopted deterministically provided the payoff difference exceeds the cost of strategy change , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath34 . for @xmath35 ,",
    "strategies performing worse are also adopted with a certain probability , _",
    "e.g. _ , due to imperfect information .",
    "it is proved that the dynamics remains unaffected qualitatively when changing @xmath31 , and @xmath36 within realistic limits . following the previous work  @xcite",
    ", we simply fix the value of @xmath31 and @xmath36 to be @xmath37 , and concentrate on the general dynamical properties affected by the structure of ln .",
    "we study above model by monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations started from a random initial distribution of c and d strategies . after appropriate relaxation times",
    ", the system can converge to a dynamical equilibrium state .",
    "we characterise this state by the stationary density of cooperators @xmath38 averaged over the last @xmath39 mc steps of the @xmath40 total sampling steps .",
    "figures  [ figpr ] ( a1 ) , ( a2 ) , and ( a3 ) show the dependence of stationary density of cooperators @xmath38 on the multiplication factor @xmath0 for the systems with @xmath23 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the simulation data result from an average over either ten realizations of independent initial strategy distributions or ten realizations of the ln networks . for @xmath43 , _",
    "i.e. _ , when the in and ln are identical , we recover the results of ref .",
    "@xcite : below the threshold value @xmath44 cooperators quickly vanish ( the absorbing homogenous state with all defectors ) , whereas for high @xmath45 defectors go extinct ( the absorbing homogenous state with all cooperators ) ; for intermediate @xmath0 , strategies c and d coexist in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "the @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) indicates the value of @xmath0 where cooperators ( defectors ) vanish . in the case",
    "that @xmath48 , _",
    "i.e. _ , when each player can communicate with more arms via shortcuts , the quantitative properties of the stationary density @xmath38 are different [ see the curves with different @xmath15 in figs .",
    "[ figpr ] ( a1 ) , ( a2 ) and ( a3 ) ]",
    ".    one can find from figs .",
    "[ figpr ] ( a1 ) , and ( a2 ) that , each of the @xmath38 curve with @xmath49 has a cross point ( denoted by @xmath50 ) with the curve of @xmath43 .",
    "the density of cooperators @xmath38 for the system with larger @xmath15 is comparatively smaller at @xmath51 region , but larger @xmath38 at @xmath52 region .",
    "that is to say , for the systems with @xmath23 and @xmath41 , the more available role models will favour cooperators when @xmath0 is large , and favour defectors in contrast when @xmath0 is small .",
    "however , the system with @xmath53 [ figs .  [ figpr ] ( a3 ) ] is obviously different from that of @xmath23 and @xmath41 , that is , the arms can favour cooperators in the whole range of @xmath0 with respect to the @xmath43 system , moreover , defectors vanish at much lower @xmath0 .",
    "we plot the phase diagrams of the corresponding systems in figs .",
    "[ figpr ] ( b1 ) , ( b2 ) , and ( b3 ) , respectively .",
    "the two bold solid curves respectively show the @xmath46 and @xmath47 averaged over @xmath54 realizations , which divide the region into absorbing homogenous states of c ( upper ) and d ( lower ) , as well as the coexistence regime of the two strategies ( intermediate ) .",
    "that is , for fixed number of arms , when varying the factor @xmath0 , two phase transitions occur between the coexistence region and homogeneous states of c or d. in the coexistence regime , the three dash lines present the contours @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the straight dot line in the middle corresponds to @xmath58 , larger than which the social dilemma raised by the pgg with @xmath4 is relaxed in the sense that each unity investment has a positive net return . as @xmath43 defectors may exist in the system and exploit cooperators until @xmath0 is very larger .",
    "however , from the rapid decline of @xmath47 with increasing @xmath15 we know that , with the aid of the arms , defectors vanish at much smaller @xmath0 .",
    "more , interestingly , even if @xmath59 , defectors can be eliminated as long as @xmath60 for @xmath23 , @xmath61 for @xmath62 , or @xmath63 for @xmath53 .",
    "also , the region of homogenous c becomes wider as the value of @xmath19 increases .",
    "the cross points @xmath50 of those @xmath38 curves of @xmath48 with the curve of @xmath43 in fig .",
    "[ figpr ] ( a1 ) [ and ( a2 ) ] are marked by the ( red ) dash - dot line in the phase diagram .",
    "the coexistence regime of c and d thus is separated into two regions by this line , with arms favouring cooperation in the upper region , but favouring defection in the lower region .",
    "it can be seen that , the cross points @xmath50 is not sensitive to the parameter @xmath15 . for the system with @xmath62",
    "the upper region favouring cooperation is comparatively wider than that with @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , for the system with @xmath53 [ see figs .",
    "[ figpr ] ( a3 ) and ( b3 ) ] , those @xmath38 curves are not intersectant , and the arms favour cooperators in the whole range of @xmath0 .",
    "the curves of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and other contours of @xmath38 for various @xmath19 systems are proved to asymptotically approach @xmath58 with increasing @xmath15 , and finally collapse into one there ( @xmath58 ) for @xmath64 , which implies that each player can learn from the whole population .",
    "that is to say , as a result of the dynamical process the system with @xmath64 will end up in the absorbing d state for any @xmath0 smaller than @xmath65 , where the first - order phase transition from d to c takes place .",
    "we also notice that the arms may affect the severity of the competition between c and d , which is characterised by the rate of the effective strategy update @xmath66 ( the fraction of players who adopt the opposite strategy in each generation averaged over @xmath67 mc steps ) .",
    "for the sake of comparison , the rate @xmath66 are plotted as a function of @xmath38 in figs .",
    "[ figpr ] ( c1 ) , ( c2 ) , and ( c3 ) for the systems with @xmath23 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , respectively . for a given stationary density @xmath38 , the system with larger @xmath15 results in larger rate @xmath66 , which implies that more arms induce more intense competition .",
    "this is due to the additional mutual contacts between c and d , or , in other words the larger surface between c and d in the ln network , induced by the additional shortcuts .",
    "also , @xmath66 exhibits a bell - like form , because the surface between c and d will shrink with the density difference of the two strategies .",
    "additionally , for a given value of @xmath15 , the system with larger @xmath19 are found to result in smaller rate @xmath66 .",
    "figure  [ figtu ] shows the snapshots of the system with identical in and ln ( left hand ) , as well as the system with @xmath68 and @xmath62 ln ( right hand ) , respectively . for the case of identical in and ln",
    "[ figtu](a)(c ) ] , it is known from pgg and other cooperation games that , cooperators persist through forming compact c clusters and thereby reducing exploitation by defectors  @xcite . however , for the availability of arms [ fig .",
    "[ figtu](b)(d ) ] , the c clusters break into smaller pieces .",
    "furthermore , one interesting phenomenon distinctly exhibited in fig .",
    "[ figtu ] ( d ) is , some rare cooperators may take place at the sites totally surrounded by defectors , where it is extremely difficult for c to survive because of the very low payoffs .",
    "these sites are found to be connected by shortcuts to the well - paid c role models who are located in the c clusters .",
    "therefore , we can say that , the c strategy is adopted there when players blindly imitate the successful role models without regard to their own actual ` habitats ' .",
    "this may correspond to the phenomenon in society that , some people follow like sheep to the manner of others ignoring the question whether it fits into their own social surrounding . interestingly , this unreasonable behavior simply introduces mutations to the population of d. we therefore suggest that , it may provide one mechanism to favour cooperation , for the invasions of c may form mutual protection and thus survive in the population of d , although the rare c therein are unstable and hard to propagate by themselves .",
    "in addition , these sites exhibit one path to put up the fluctuating individuals @xcite , who alternatively spend some time as cooperators and some time as defectors .",
    "finally , we focus our attention on how the localised communication affects the evolution of cooperation .",
    "the stationary density of cooperators @xmath38 at different values of @xmath0 are plotted as a function of @xmath19 in fig .",
    "[ figpa ] .",
    "we can see that the values of @xmath38 keep almost invariable in the region @xmath69 .",
    "this can be naturally understood from the results in fig .",
    "[ figle ] , as well as the analysis in the ref .",
    "@xcite that , in this region the ln network behaves as a small world with the topological properties changing slowly with @xmath19 .",
    "however , in the large @xmath19 region , which implies that the ln is distinctly localised , cooperation is favoured more compared to the case with @xmath23 .",
    "we have known that , the cooperators protect each other and survive by forming clusters .",
    "thus , when the shortcuts are clustered by larger @xmath19 , one cooperator is more likely to select role models within its own c cluster via shortcuts .",
    "that is to say , the mutual protection among cooperators is enhanced by large @xmath19 , and thereby cooperation is favoured .",
    "this mechanism is obviously reflected by the monotonic increase of @xmath38 with @xmath19 at large @xmath19 region .",
    "furthermore , the best communication strategy for players to promote cooperation is @xmath70 , which corresponds to the extremely localised selection of arms , _ i.e. _ , the ln network with the shortcuts merely connects the next - nearest neighbours through lattice links .",
    "it is also notable in fig .",
    "[ figpa ] that , the @xmath38 monotonically increases with @xmath19 when @xmath0 is comparatively large ( about @xmath71 ) , however , the nonmonotonic behaviors of @xmath38 occur for the cases of smaller @xmath0 .",
    "this result is proved to remain unaffected qualitatively for different vales of @xmath15 within realistic limits .",
    "as it is well known , the cooperators located along the boundary of the c clusters ( the so - called * boundary c * in the following text ) outweigh the losses against defectors by gains from interactions within the c cluster  @xcite .",
    "these boundary c gain low payoffs and thus would be sensitive to the introduction of the arms , _ i.e. _ , what kind of role models they meet with via shortcuts really matters .",
    "the system at the coexistence state is composed of cooperators as well as two kinds of defectors , the defector located right at the boundary of c cluster which we named d@xmath72 , and the defector surrounded by the same - strategy interaction neighbours which we named d@xmath73 .",
    "one d@xmath72 would accumulate comparatively higher payoff by exploiting the boundary c , and then act as an attractive role model of its learning neighbours .",
    "however , one d@xmath73 gains zero payoff , and thus will not affect the stability of others strategy .",
    "they put up fluctuating individuals if they are linked to well - paid c by shortcuts , as that discussed above . in our model , the players will choose arms nearer and nearer to its vicinity as @xmath19 increases from @xmath74 .",
    "when @xmath19 is around @xmath75 , the lattice lengths of these shortcuts ( see fig .  [ figle ] ) approximately reach the general size of the c clusters , then the probability for the boundary c to meet with the well - paid d@xmath72 players becomes larger , which would pose a high risk to the stability of the boundary c. the c cluster becomes constricted and thus cooperation is depressed when the boundary c imitates d@xmath72 .",
    "this effect can be clearly observed from the comparatively smaller @xmath38 around @xmath76 at small @xmath0 ( see fig .  [ figpa ] ) .",
    "however , when the value of @xmath0 is large , this effect is weakened by the c clusters highly crowded [ see fig .",
    "[ figtu](b ) ] .",
    "in summary , we have shown how the communication among players may affect the evolution of cooperation by means of a two - layered pgg model .",
    "the learning layer is constructed as a kleinberg small - world network , where two players can communicate with probability depending on their spatial euclidean lattice distance in the power - law form controlled by an exponent @xmath19 .",
    "the players capacity of communication is characterised by the number and the distance of the role models from whom they can learn the individual information .",
    "the biased effect of nonzero @xmath19 , which gives rise to the preferential selection of role models near the vicinity , corresponds to the localization of players communication induced by limited capacity .",
    "our simulation results indicate that , the communication among players plays a highly important role in the evolution of cooperation : the density of c is crucially influenced by the number ( @xmath15 ) and the location of the arms ; the coexistence region of c and d is reduced and @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) is expected to tend to @xmath42 ( the group size @xmath77 ) if @xmath15 increases ; in addition , for certain density of c , more available arms result in more intense competition between c and d. moreover , the communication via shortcuts ( _ i.e. _ the arms ) are found to introduce mutation to the population of d , which might be helpful to the emergence of c. it is also notable that , the localised communication with large @xmath19 can favour cooperators .",
    "our model gives a crude simulation of real social behavior .",
    "however , it does catch a few features of potential interest .",
    "the most interesting feature is the localised communication favouring cooperation .",
    "we suggest that , the limitation of humans capacity to build up communication system , which results in the localised selection of role models , would be a new mechanism supporting the emergence and persistence of cooperation in society .",
    "the other feature is that a population of cheaters would be invaded by cooperators by the presence of long - range social connections .",
