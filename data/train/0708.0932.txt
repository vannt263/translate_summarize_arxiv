    "we term these more or less spherical bubbles ` fat bubbles ' .",
    "fat bubbles are defined by the following properties : ( 1 ) fat bubbles come in pairs , each on opposite sides of the equatorial plane . in some cases",
    "there is departure from axisymmetry , and they are not exactly opposite .",
    "( 2 ) they touch each other at the center , and by that form an hourglass structure ( like the figure 8 ) .",
    "one bubble of the hourglass structure is referred to as a fat bubble .",
    "( 3 ) the density inside the bubbles is much lower than that of their surroundings ( ambient gas ) .",
    "( 4 ) they are fully or partially surrounded by relatively thin shell that is denser than the surroundings .",
    "( 5 ) in some cases their boundary , on the far side from the center , is open . in classifying planetary nebulae , for example , this structure is refereed to as a bipolar nebula .",
    "there are many such planetary nebulae that are well resolved in the visible band , and the bipolar structure is well defined . in many cases",
    "there are similar structures in planetary nebulae and in clusters of galaxies ( soker & bisker 2005 ) .",
    "the best examples of the hourglass type of structure we aim to study are the bubbles in perseus ( fabian et al . 2000 ) and in a  2052 , ( blanton et al . 2001 ) .",
    "other cases are cited above and in soker & bisker 2006 .",

    ", two and three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of jets and bubbles in clusters of galaxies , were conducted to study different aspects of their interaction with the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) , such as heating the icm ( e.g. , basson & alexander , 2003 ; heinz & churazov , 2005 ; reynolds et al .",

    "in our studies we aim to understand the conditions leading to the formation of fat bubbles .    in previous papers ( soker 2004 , 2006 ; sternberg et al .",
    "2007 , hereafter paper i ) we proposed that in order to inflate fat bubbles , either the jet s opening angle has to be large , i.e. , wide jets , or the jet is narrow but its axis has to change its direction .",
    "the change in direction can result from precession ( soker 2004 , 2006 ) , random change ( heinz et al .",
    "2006 ) , or a relative motion between the icm and the active galactic nucleus ( agn ; loken et al . 1995 ; soker & bisker 2006 ; rodrguez - martnez et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in paper",
    "i we conducted two - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of wide jets expanding in the icm .",
    "we found that wide jets can indeed inflate fat bubbles that reside very close to the center of the cluster .",
    "for this to occur , we found that the jets should have high momentum flux .",
    "typically , the half opening angle should be @xmath6 , and the large momentum flux requires a jet speed of @xmath7 , i.e. , highly non - relativistic , but supersonic ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "narrow relativistic jets can exist in parallel with the slow wide outflow , but they will not lead to the inflation of fat bubbles .",
    "the inflation process involves large vortices and local instabilities which mix some icm with the hot bubble .",
    "these results predict that most of the gas inside the bubble has a temperature of @xmath9 , and that large quantities of the cooling gas in cooling flow clusters are expelled back to the intra - cluster medium and heated up ( soker & pizzolato 2005 ) . in paper",
    "i we suggested that the magnetic fields and relativistic electrons that produce the synchrotron radio emission might be formed in the shock wave of the non - relativistic jet .",
    "motivated by our earlier results , in this paper we examine the inflation of fat bubbles by narrow precessing jets .",
    "the simulations were performed using the _ virginia _ _ hydrodynamics - i _ code ( vh-1 ; blondin et al .",
    "1990 ; stevens et al . 1992 ) , as described in paper i. we simulated a three - dimensional axisymmetric flow , so practically we simulated a quarter of the meridional plane using the two - dimensional version of the code in spherical coordinates .",
    "the symmetry axis of all plots shown in this paper is along the horizontal axis ( the x axis ) while the equitorial plane is vertical .",
    "radiative cooling and gravity were not included , since the total time of the simulation , @xmath10 , is somewhat shorter than the gravitational time scale , and much shorter than the radiative cooling time .",
    "this preliminary report aims to emphasize the jet properties that determine whether or not the required bubble is inflated , hence , these omissions are justified .",
    "we used the @xmath11 model ( with @xmath12 ) as the initial density profile of the icm , @xmath13^{-3/4 } , \\label{rho}\\ ] ] with @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( see paper i and references therein ) .",
    "the icm temperature is @xmath16 .",
    "the box size used in our simulations was @xmath17 ( one quarter of the meridional plane ) .",
    "we used a @xmath18 evenly spaced grid . as discussed in paper",
    "i , higher resolution does not change the large scale behavior , thus , this resolution is sufficient for our study . in figure [ resolution ]",
    "we present density maps ( logarithem of the density .",
    "the density is given in @xmath19 . ) of two runs with the same parameters but different resolution ( @xmath18 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "this figure clearly shows that the large scale behavior does not change significantly with the increase in resolution .",

    "the symmetry axis of the jet is at an angle @xmath28 in respect to the symmetry axis of the problem ( the x axis ) .",
    "this is the precessing angle which is a function of time .",
    "because of the axisymmetric nature of our problem , the meaning of a precessing jet in these simulations is that the narrow jet precess around the symmetry axis very rapidly . namely , the precessing period around the symmetry axis is much shorter than any other relevant time scale in the problem , e.g. , the time scale over which @xmath0 is changing .    due to the numerical nature of the jets injection , in some cases a fraction of the injected mass does not succeed in mounting our grid and remains in the first cells of the grid . in the next time step the jet properties are reinserted into these cells and this mass is lost .",
    "moreover , if the jet is precessing , then the movement of the injection zone my increase / decrease the effective opening angle of the jet , in effect changing @xmath24 , such that only after the simulation we can determine the mass loss rate and kinetic luminosity of the jet .",
    "the kinetic luminosity of the jet is constant , and is equal to @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the pressure and @xmath31 is the volume inflated after time @xmath32 .",
    "we calculated this value at several times for each case , and was taken to be the kinetic luminosity .",

    "the jet should spend more time at large angles in order to reduce the break - through along the symmetry axis that happens when it s precessing angle is small .",
    "this favors a case with random precession , i.e. , the jet axis covers constant solid angle per unit time and the precessing angle is bound in the range @xmath120 .",
    "4 .   for any prescribed precession behavior and parameters that can form a fat bubble",
    ", the maximum precessing angle should be quite large , @xmath121 .",
    "the slow velocity and large energy of the jet inflating fat bubbles require that the two opposite jets carry large amount of mass .",
    "the two jets together can expel back to the icm a mass at a rate of @xmath122 .      and on the physics behind them .",
    "as discussed in previous papers ( soker 2004 ; 2006 ; paper i ) , the basic condition for a jet to inflate a fat bubble is that the jet s head will reside inside the bubble , or , if the jet s head is outside the bubble , that the jet s head will not  run away  from the expanding bubble .",
    "for example , in the case of constant large precessing angle ( run fix10 in figure [ const_not_good ] ) , the jet s head revolves around the symmetry axis but at a large distance .",
    "it inflates a local low density region , a torus around the axis .",
    "but this torus expands too slowly to inflate a fat bubble .",
    "namely , the motion of the jet s head is too fast for the expanding shocked gas .",
    "this condition for the jet s direction not to escape from the expanding bubble formed by its shocked material is given in equation ( 17 ) of soker ( 2006 ) .",
    "this explains why the precessing angle can not be too large ( point 2 above ) .",
    "the same principle holds for the jet s head not to expand too fast in the radial direction .",
    "if the expansion of the jet is concentrated within a small solid angle , e.g. , a small precession angle , the large momentum flux ( ram pressure ) will result in a jet s head that moves radially faster than the expansion of the shocked gas .",
    "a long bubble will be formed instead of a fat bubble .",
    "this explains points 3 and 4 above and the lower limit on the precessing constant angle in point 2 .",
    "qualitatively , this condition on the solid angle of the expanding jet is given by equation ( 14 ) in soker ( 2004 ) that was derived for a wide jet instead of a precessing jet , and was shown to hold in the numerical simulations of wide jets ( paper i ) .",
    "regarding point 1 above .",
    "if the jet s speed is too low , for a given energy it is too dense . as a result of that",
    ", the bubble expands too slowly and the jet s head moves radially too fast .",
    "this is also seen by equation ( 14 ) in soker ( 2004 ) , and was shown to hold for wide jets ( paper i ) . if the jet s material is too fast , the shocked jet s gas expands much faster than the jet s head . in that case",
    "the shocked low density gas fills the entire inner region , and the two opposite jets form a large elliptically - shaped bubble instead of a bipolar ( hourglass ) structure of two fat bubbles .",
    "this is very similar to the case of wide angle ( paper i ) .",
    "note that in some of the simulations no dense icm gas is left in the equatorial plane near the center ( e.g. , figure [ const_not_good ] , see also paper i ) .",
    "this shows that dense icm in the equatorial plane near the center we find in some runs ( e.g. , figures [ rand_t30 ] , see also paper i ) is real and not a numerical artifact .",
    "point 5 has far reaching implications .",
    "are such a high mass outflow rates as we find here and in paper i where we simulated wide jets , @xmath122 , compatible with observations ?",
    "are wide jets simulated in paper i ( or wide precession angle simulated here ) compatible with observations ?",
    "the answer to both questions seems to be positive . in paper",
    "i we have already discussed indications for agns that blow slow jets , some of them with wide angles ( crenshaw & kraemer 2007 ; behar et al .",
    "2003 ; kaspi & behar 2006 ) .",
    "these recent observational results ( see also de kool et al .",
    "2001 ) , and our numerical results support the model where the feedback in both cooling flow clusters and in the process of galaxy formation occurs mainly ( but not solely , as relativistic narrow jets also exist ) by slow massive jets , as suggested and discussed by soker & pizzolato ( 2005 ) .",
    "the massive jets imply that not only energy , but mass as well is part of the feedback cycle ( soker & pizzolato 2005 ; pizzolato & soker 2005 ) .",
    "massive jets were also considered before by , e.g. , begelman & celotti ( 2004 ) and binney ( 2004 ) , and were simulated by omma et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who took the jet speed and mass outflow rate to be @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively . in the simulation of heinz",
    "et al . ( 2006 ) one jet has a mass loss rate of @xmath125 .",
    "this implies that the two jets inject @xmath126 into the icm . without stating it , heinz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) followed the suggestion of soker & pizzolato ( 2005 ) , that a large fraction or even most of the gas that cools to low temperatures in cooling flow clusters gains energy directly from the central black hole , and is injected back to the icm .",
    "the main effect discussed in the present paper is a dynamical effect with supersonic velocities .",
    "therefore , the temperature ( and entropy ) profile of the icm has little effect on the conclusions . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will follow the bubbles as they buoy to larger distances ( @xmath127 ) . there",
    "the entropy will have a crucial role , and a more realistic temperature profile will be used .",
    "( 1 ) : :    in many of the simulated cases , but not in all of them , a non    negligible low density matter flows to the equatorial plane and stays    there .",
    "this is generally not observed .",
    "it is quite possible that    magnetic tension will suppress this low density backflow .",
    "this is    because the backflow is expected to stretch magnetic field lines . in    addition",
    ", gravity might cause this low density equatorial gas to buoy    outward .",
    "gravity and magnetic fields are not included in our    simulations .",
    "we will include gravity in future simulations .",
    "however ,    neither gravity nor magnetic fields are expected to prevent the    presence of hot low density gas in the equatorial plane in cases of    very fast jets where the backflow toward the equator is strong .",
    "( 2 ) : :    in some cases a torus shaped cavity is inflated at the beginning of    the simulation , achieving a spherical shaped cavity only at later    times .",
    "we remind the reader that we assumed a very short - period    precession about the symmetry axis , in effect reducing the simulations    dimensions to two .",
    "a full three dimensional simulation of a randomly    precessing jets ( and even a pulsed jet , whose activity is turned on    and off ) , might result in the inflation of low density small bubbles    and not a torus as in the 2d simulations .",
    "these small bubbles merge on    a short time to form a larger bubble .",
    "we leave the investigation of    this process to a full 3d simulations in the future .",
    "concerning these discrepancies and the observations discussed above , we suggest that in most , but probably not in all , cases fat bubbles are inflated by wide jets or rapidly and randomly precessing jets .",
