    "it has been used as a measure for the complexity of computational problems in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra ( see for example @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "the two most frequent definitions of @xmath1-graded castelnuovo - mumford regularity are the one in terms of graded betti numbers and the one using local cohomology .",
    "the equivalence of this two definitions is one of the main basic results of the theory . for a wider discussion about regularity",
    ", we refer to @xcite or to the survey of bayer and mumford @xcite and the more recent one @xcite .",
    "a multigraded extension of castelnuovo - mumford regularity for modules over a polynomial ring over a field was introduced by hoffman and wang in a special case in @xcite , and later by maclagan and smith in a more general setting in @xcite .",

    "the homogeneous coordinate ring , introduced in @xcite , is a polynomial ring @xmath4 graded by the divisor class group @xmath5 of @xmath2 together with a monomial ideal @xmath6 generated by monomials corresponding to the complement of faces in @xmath3 .",
    "the dictionary linking the geometry of @xmath2 with the theory of @xmath5-graded @xmath4-modules leads to geometric interpretations and applications for multigraded regularity .    in @xcite ,",
    "hoffman and wang define the concept of regularity for bigraded modules over a bigraded polynomial ring motivated by the geometry of @xmath7 .",
    "they prove analogs of some of the classical results on @xmath8-regularity for graded modules over polynomial algebras . in @xcite ,",
    "maclagan and smith develop a multigraded variant of castelnuovo - mumford regularity also motivated by toric geometry , working with @xmath5-graded modules over a cox ring @xmath9 .    in this article",
    "we introduce a further generalization of this notion , first by working over any commutative base ring , and second by considering local cohomology with support in any finitely generated graded ideal .",
    "the first extension provides a natural approach for working with families of sheaves or of graded modules and the second provides a more flexible and powerful tool for applications .",
    "our definition of multigraded regularity is given in terms of the vanishing of graded components of local cohomology with respect to a graded ideal @xmath0 , following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we show how to transfer knowledge in two directions .",
    "first , to deduce some information on the graded betti numbers from the knowledge of regions where the local cohomology with support in a given graded ideal vanishes .",
    "second to assert the vanishing of local cohomology of a graded module with support in any graded ideal from the shifts in a free resolution of the graded module and the cohomology of the polynomial ring .",
    "the second direction was shown in @xcite where they remark , besides their proof , the result directly follows from a standard spectral sequence argument but there was only partial results concerning the reverse direction .    to go from regularity to resolutions ,",
    "maclagan and smith proved the existence of a complex with @xmath0-torsion homology and shifts bounded in terms of @xmath10 , that provides a resolution at the sheaf level of a truncation of @xmath11 giving rise to the same sheaf as @xmath11 .",
    "our results give estimates for the shifts in a true resolution of the module itself .",

    "this article is organized in three sections . in section",
    "@xmath21 we gather some basic facts on local cohomology . local cohomology , defined as the cohomology of the ech complex constructed on a finite set of generators of @xmath0 only depend on the radical of the ideal @xmath0 , and correspond the sheaf cohomology with support in @xmath22 ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "is explained in remark [ remsuppfiniter+ ] .",
    "this in particular applies to projective toric varieties .",

    "these results rely heavily on the material in the third section and are the core of this section .",
    "+ subsection @xmath73 is dedicated to extend results in @xcite and @xcite providing sharper finite subsets of the grading group @xmath5 that bound the degrees of the minimal generators of a minimal free resolution of a truncation of @xmath11 . in lemma [ tronctor ]",

    "the fifth subsection of section @xmath28 consists in a very simple example where we illustrate that the vanishing of the local cohomology modules of a principal ideal depends not only on the degree but on the generator itself , opposite to what happens in the classical theory .",
    "for simplicity , we treat the case of a form of bidegree @xmath80 , with @xmath4 and @xmath0 as in example [ ex11 ] .",
