    "studies of electromagnetic and weak reactions are an important part of nuclear physics . they deliver information on electromagnetic properties of nuclei , transitions between nuclear states and details of electromagnetic and weak currents inside nuclei  @xcite . in the broader sense the precise description of electromagnetic and weak reactions is a challenging test for models of the nuclear hamiltonian and current operators as well as for the used theoretical schemes and numerical methods .",
    "chiral effective field theory ( @xmath2eft ) is currently the most important theoretical approach , which can and should be tested in investigations of electromagnetic and weak processes . among many attempts to do that in the few - nucleon sector we mention  @xcite and references therein .",
    "however , these works were usually restricted to small energies or the lowest orders of the chiral expansion or combine the phenomenological potentials and chiral currents within the so - called `` hybrid '' @xmath2eft approach or cover only selected reaction channels .    the continuous progress in the field of @xmath2eft has resulted in the development of sophisticated nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) and many - nucleon interactions  @xcite .",
    "these forces have been used to describe reactions in three - nucleon ( 3n ) systems  @xcite , the structure of light nuclei  @xcite and nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "results obtained for nn scattering at energies up to 300 mev and nucleon - deuteron elastic scattering proved the usefulness and high quality of chiral potentials . in these first studies the regularization of nn and 3n potentials in momentum space with the nonlocal regulator was used  @xcite .",
    "recently it was shown  @xcite that such a regularization scheme introduces artifacts and affects the correct physical behavior of the potential at long distances .",
    "in addition , the spectral function regularization had to be introduced in order to cut off the unwanted short - range part of the two - pion exchange potential .",
    "this in turn causes too strong dependence of predictions on values of the cut - off parameters  @xcite .",
    "the bochum - bonn group proposed recently in refs .",
    "@xcite an improved version of the chiral potential up to fifth order of the chiral expansion ( n@xmath3lo ) . during its construction",
    ", regularization is performed in coordinate space and only afterwards such a regularized force is transformed to momentum space . in particular , the one - pion and the static two - pion exchange potentials are regularized in coordinate space by multiplying them by the function @xmath4 ^ 6 $ ] , with @xmath5 being the cut - off ( regularization ) parameter .",
    "this procedure maintains the long - range part of the interaction and leads to smaller undesirable regularization effects .",
    "indeed , as shown in  @xcite the nn phase shifts as well as the deuteron properties are much less sensitive to the values of the regularization parameter @xmath5 than the ones obtained within the older version  @xcite .",
    "the same is also true for elastic nucleon - deuteron ( nd ) scattering observables  @xcite .",
    "the three - nucleon force with consistent local regularization is under development , so in this paper we only use two - body interactions and , in addition , we neglect the coulomb force .",
    "one of important and unique features of the @xmath2eft approach is a possibility of a consistent derivation of nuclear forces and electroweak current operators , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite for works in these direction .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite the long - range part of the leading two - pion exchange contributions was derived .",
    "together with the well known single nucleon current ( snc ) and consistent old , nonlocal version of chiral interaction they were used to study the deuteron and the @xmath0he photodisintegration in refs .  @xcite . while the general description of observables was reasonable",
    ", a strong cut - off dependence of predictions was also observed .",
    "similar results were obtained for radiative nucleon - deuteron capture and @xmath0he photodisintegration where instead of explicit many - body currents the siegert theorem was used  @xcite .",
    "the strong variation of predictions due to different values of the cut - off parameters practically precluded us from drawing detailed physical conclusions .",
    "thus it is very interesting to see whether the cut - off dependence also becomes smaller for the electromagnetic processes , when the newly developed improved chiral interactions are considered . in the present work we use the siegert approach and postpone studies based on explicit single nucleon and many - body electromagnetic currents until a more complete picture of the electroweak current operator , consistent with the nn interaction at each order of the chiral expansion ,",
    "is known .",
    "the question of the cut - off dependence can be also addressed in weak reactions .",
    "thus we use the improved nn forces  @xcite to calculate the capture rates in muon capture reactions on the deuteron and @xmath0he . in this paper",
    "we employ a nonrelativistic single nucleon weak current operator supplemented with leading relativistic corrections ( rc )  @xcite .",
    "since we are mainly interested in the cut - off dependence of capture rates , the use of such an incomplete model of the current operator is justified in the present investigation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we give a short overview of our formalism for electromagnetic and weak processes .",
    "section  [ chap3 ] contains selected results for the deuteron photodisintegration process , @xmath6 , while in sections  [ chap4 ] and  [ chap5 ] we discuss 3n electromagnetic processes : nucleon - deuteron radiative capture , @xmath7 , and the total @xmath0he photodisintegration @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the results for weak muon capture processes , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are presented in section  [ chap6 ] .",
    "we summarize in section  [ chap7 ] .",
    "the theoretical approach used in the present study is described in detail in  @xcite , so here we only remind the reader of the key steps .",
    "we work in momentum space and employ a formalism based on the 3n faddeev equations .",
    "the nuclear matrix elements for electromagnetic or weak disintegration processes are the central quantities from which we are able to calculate observables  @xcite .    in the case of the deuteron photodisintegration ,",
    "the nuclear matrix element @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the final proton - neutron scattering state and the initial deuteron bound state , respectively .",
    "the deuteron state is a solution of the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian comprising the nn potential @xmath17 .",
    "the same interaction , together with the free two - nucleon ( 2n ) propagator @xmath18 , enters the lippmann - schwinger equation for the @xmath19 operator , @xmath20 which we use to obtain the final scattering state .",
    "then the @xmath13 is given as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the eigenstate of the relative proton - neutron momentum .",
    "the form of the electromagnetic current operator @xmath23 is discussed below .",
    "radiative nucleon - deuteron capture is related via the time reversal symmetry to the two - body @xmath0he or @xmath0h photodisintegration reactions .",
    "we exploit this relation and calculate the nuclear matrix element for the radiative nd capture @xmath24 from the matrix element @xmath25 for the photodisintegration reaction , leading to the final nucleon - deuteron scattering state @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "the matrix element @xmath27 can be expressed as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the 3n bound state while @xmath30 is the product of the internal deuteron state and the state describing the free relative motion of the third nucleon with respect to the deuteron .",
    "@xmath31 is a permutation operator with @xmath32 being the operator exchanging nucleons @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the auxiliary state @xmath35 fulfills the faddeev - like equation  @xcite @xmath36 with the free 3n propagator @xmath18 .",
    "the nuclear matrix element for @xmath0he photodisintegration leading to three free nucleons in the final state , @xmath37 , is also given by the auxiliary state @xmath35 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is an antisymmetrized state describing the free motion of the three outgoing nucleons .",
    "the nuclear electromagnetic current operators , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , employed for the deuteron and @xmath0he ( @xmath0h ) photodisintegration processes , are constructed in the same way .",
    "unfortunately the 2n currents fully consistent with the locally regularized nuclear potentials are not yet available .",
    "therefore , we approximate the electromagnetic current by a sum of contributions from the individual nucleons and supplement these results by the many - body parts incorporated via the siegert theorem  @xcite . to this end",
    "we perform a multipole decomposition of the corresponding single nucleon current matrix elements and use standard identities @xcite to express a part of the electric multipoles by the coulomb multipoles , generated again by the single nucleon charge density operator .",
    "this step is justified by the fact that at low energies many - nucleon contributions to the nuclear charge density are small .",
    "the remaining part of the electric multipoles and all the magnetic multipoles are taken solely from the single nucleon current operators . the siegert theorem , together with the so - called siegert hypothesis , is also widely used in many calculations performed in coordinate space , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this form of the nuclear current operator has the ( purely technical ) advantage that it does not depend on the nucleon - nucleon potential employed in our calculations .",
    "we denote this model of the current operator as snc+siegert .    the weak muon capture processes on atomic nuclei",
    "are described by means of similar nuclear matrix elements as in eqs .",
    "( [ eq3])-([equ ] ) , which are combined with the well - known leptonic part  @xcite , to build the full transition amplitudes . depending on the studied process the deuteron or @xmath0he wave function represents the initial nuclear bound state . for the @xmath42 reaction",
    ", the final two - neutron scattering state is calculated using the @xmath19-operator . in the case of break - up channels in muon",
    "capture on @xmath0he the corresponding two- and three - body scattering states are required .",
    "we calculate them analogously to the states for photodisintegration , again using eq.([u3n ] ) , with the electromagnetic current @xmath41 replaced by the weak current @xmath43  @xcite . since we solve eq.([u3n ] ) at a given energy of the 3n system , numerous solutions of faddeev - like equation ( [ u3n ] ) have to be obtained in order to cover the whole range of the final muon neutrino energies .",
    "this significantly increases the numerical complexity of such calculations .",
    "of course , in the case of @xmath10 channel we use only pre - calculated @xmath0he and @xmath0h states and no faddeev equation for the bound state has to be solved repeatedly . for the weak current @xmath43 we employ a non - relativistic single nucleon current operator supplemented by the dominant @xmath44 relativistic corrections , where @xmath45 is the nucleon mass . a detailed discussion of the weak current , formulas connecting the nuclear matrix elements with the capture rates and various aspects of the reaction kinematics are given in  @xcite .",
    "our calculations are performed in momentum space and we use the formalism of partial waves . in the calculations we employ all partial waves in the two - body systems up to the two - body total angular momentum j@xmath463 and in the three - body states up to the three - body total angular momentum j@xmath47 .",
    "such sets of partial waves guarantee convergence of predictions for all observables , see  @xcite for more technical details .",
    "the 3n bound states are obtained as in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to estimate the theoretical errors of predictions arising from neglecting , at a given order of the chiral expansion , the contributions from higher orders , we apply the prescription given in  @xcite .",
    "namely , we estimate the truncation error @xmath48 of an observable @xmath49 at @xmath33-th order of the chiral expansion , with @xmath50 .",
    "if @xmath51 denotes the chiral expansion parameter , the expressions for truncation errors are @xmath52 in the above formulas @xmath53 is a prediction for the observable @xmath49 at @xmath33-th order , @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "we also require that @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath56 .",
    "in particular , such a way of theoretical error estimation takes into account the fact that our present calculations are incomplete as we do not include the 3n force starting from n@xmath1lo .",
    "furthermore , we do _ not _ estimate in this paper the uncertainty from the truncation of the chiral expansion of the current operators , which are included by means of the siegert theorem at all considered orders .",
    "the actual theoretical uncertainty may , therefore , be larger than the values of @xmath59 given below .",
    "a more reliable uncertainty quantification requires performing complete calculations including the corresponding 3n forces and exchange current operators .",
    "this work is in progress .",
    "in fig .  [ fig1 ] we show the total cross section for @xmath60 process at photon laboratory energies e@xmath61 up to 80 mev obtained using the chiral nn interaction at n@xmath3lo  @xcite with the value of the regularization parameter @xmath5=0.9 fm . in this case",
    "we apply two models of the electromagnetic current : the snc alone ( the dashed red curve ) and the snc+siegert ( the thick dashed black curve ) .",
    "it is clear that while the omission of 2n currents leads to a poor description of the data , the snc+siegert approach yields an excellent agreement with the experimental results . for the sake of comparison with the predictions based on semi - phenomenological forces , we show also predictions obtained with the av18 nn interaction  @xcite and three models of the nuclear current : snc ( green double - dotted - dashed curve ) , snc+siegert ( dotted violet curve ) and snc+mec ( blue solid curve ) .",
    "the snc+mec model comprises single nucleon contributions and the explicit @xmath62-like and @xmath63-like meson exchange currents ( mec ) linked to av18 nn interaction ( see  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "we observe that for this observable the implicit ( snc+siegert ) and explicit ( snc+mec ) ways of including many - body contributions to the current operator give quite similar predictions , which are in a very good agreement with the data , when the av18 nn potential is used to generate the 2n states .",
    "further , the snc+siegert approach to the current operator works equally well with the chosen chiral and the av18 nn potentials . in both cases we obtain very similar predictions , practically indistinguishable at photon energies below approximately 30  mev . at the higher energies a small difference develops between the chiral and the av18 potential , with the chiral predictions lying closer to the data .     for the @xmath6 reaction .",
    "the chiral n@xmath3lo , r=0.9 fm predictions for the snc ( snc+siegert ) current model are shown with the dashed red ( thick black dashed ) curve .",
    "the av18 predictions for the snc , snc+siegert and snc+mec current models are shown with the double - dotted - dashed green , dotted violet and solid blue curve , respectively .",

    "next we study a more detailed observable , namely the differential cross section at two photon laboratory energies e@xmath61=30  mev ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the upper row ) and e@xmath61=100 mev ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the lower row ) . in the left panel",
    "we show the convergence of predictions for @xmath5=0.9 fm with respect to the order of the chiral expansion . in the middle panel",
    "the uncertainty of theoretical predictions due to the truncation of higher order contributions is given . finally ,",
    "in the right panel , we demonstrate the dependence of predictions on the values of the regulator @xmath5 at n@xmath3lo using five different values of @xmath5 : 0.8 , 0.9 , 1.0 , 1.1 and 1.2 fm .",
    "our best prediction , snc+siegert for @xmath5=0.9 fm is represented by the thick black dashed curve and is shown both in the left and right panels . for the sake of comparison , also",
    "the av18 prediction given by the thick violet dotted line is displayed in these two panels .",
    "the same arrangement of curves will be preserved also in figs .",
    "[ fig3]-[fig6 ] ,  [ fig7 ] and  [ fig11 ] .",
    "it is clear that for both energies one has to go beyond the leading order ( lo ) to describe data . at the lower energy",
    "all the higher than lo predictions are close to each other , but at e@xmath61=100 mev the convergence is reached only at n@xmath0lo .",
    "the truncation errors presented in the central panel confirm this observation and the band at n@xmath3lo lies on the n@xmath0lo one .",
    "a small but visible width of the n@xmath3lo band for the higher energy suggests that some contributions from higher orders are still possible for this observable .",
    "the cut - off dependence of the cross section is very small at lower energy and increases with energy , reaching at e@xmath61=100 mev about 20% at small proton c.m .",
    "scattering angles .",
    "however , a more careful analysis reveals that predictions obtained with @xmath5=1.1 fm and @xmath5=1.2 fm are clearly far from the other ones , which are closer to each other .",
    "this observation is in agreement with the behaviour of the cross section for the nn and nd elastic scattering  @xcite and provide yet another indication that the theoretical uncertainty of the calculations using @xmath5=1.1  fm and @xmath5=1.2  fm is dominated by finite - regulator artifacts , see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "importantly , the cut - off dependence of the cross section observed here for the semi - local chiral force is much smaller than the cut - off dependence observed for the older version of the potential with the nonlocal regularization . as shown in fig .  1 of ref .  @xcite ( pink band ) for the older potential the cut - off dependence reaches 25% already at e@xmath61=30  mev and increases with photon energy .",
    "for the improved chiral force at n@xmath3lo all predictions are slightly above the cross section calculated with the av18 potential .",

    "the difference between n@xmath0lo and n@xmath3lo predictions is below 1.6% ( 1.3% ) and the difference between predictions based on different values of the @xmath5 parameter does not exceed 7.3% ( 3.1% ) for t@xmath66 ( t@xmath67 ) .",
    "note that if we omit predictions with @xmath5=1.2 fm , the latter numbers change to 2.3% ( 1.4% ) .",

    "<S> the recently developed semi - local improved chiral nucleon - nucleon interaction is used for the first time to study several electromagnetic and weak processes at energies below the pion production threshold . cross sections and selected polarization observables for deuteron photodisintegration , nucleon - deuteron radiative capture , three - body @xmath0he photodisintegration as well as capture rates for decays of the muonic @xmath1h and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0he atoms are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the lippmann - schwinger and faddeev equations in momentum space are solved to obtain nuclear states . </S>",
    "<S> the electromagnetic current operator is taken as a single nucleon current supplemented by many - body contributions induced via the siegert theorem . </S>",
    "<S> for muon capture processes the nonrelativistic weak current together with the dominant relativistic corrections is used . </S>",
    "<S> our results compare well with experimental data , demonstrating the same quality as is observed for the semi - phenomenological av18 potential . compared to the older version of the chiral potential with a nonlocal regularization </S>",
    "<S> , a much smaller cut - off dependence is found for the state - of - art chiral local interaction employed in this paper . finally , estimates of errors due to the truncation of the chiral expansion are given . </S>"
