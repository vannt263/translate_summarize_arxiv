    "the phase diagram of the cuprate high - temperature superconductors includes three generic thermodynamic phases at zero temperature : a mott - insulating phase with commensurate antiferromagnetic order , a @xmath24-wave superconducting phase , and a metallic phase at low , intermediate , and high doping levels , respectively . in the limits of zero and large doping levels , the low - energy excitations of these phases are well understood . in the mott - insulator ,",
    "spin and charge excitations are separated by a large optical gap , and neutron scattering experiments have shown that the low - energy spin excitations are well described by a heisenberg spin hamiltonian @xcite . in the metallic phase at high doping levels , various transport experiments indicate that the fermi liquid theory yields an adequate description of the coupling between spin and charge excitations @xcite . in the @xmath24-wave superconducting ( sc ) phase , however , a quantitative description of the coupling between spin and charge excitations remains a challenge for current research , and there are some indications that such a description will also answer the central question about the origin of high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "the recent discovery of quantum oscillations in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( ) with @xmath14 and in @xmath25 indicates that the fermi liquid theory may also be applicable to underdoped cuprates @xcite , but the small size of the observed pockets is inconsistent with the large hole - like fermi surface predicted by ab - initio electronic structure calculations .",
    "this suggests a reconstruction of the fermi surface by an electronic superstructure , at least in the presence of the high magnetic fields required for the quantum oscillation experiments .",
    "an incommensurate magnetic superstructure has indeed been observed in underdoped la@xmath7sr@xmath8cuo@xmath9 ( ) @xcite , but until recently had appeared to be a peculiar property of this family of compounds .",
    "moreover , quantum oscillations have not yet been observed in , presumably due to a higher level of intrinsic disorder .",
    "we recently reported a related superstructure in a  crystal with @xmath26 @xcite , slightly below the doping level at which the quantum oscillations were observed .",
    "although the incommensurability is about a factor of two smaller than the one in  at the same doping level , this implies that incommensurate magnetic order should be regarded as another generic zero - temperature phase in the cuprate phase diagram .",
    "it remains to be established whether the incommensurate bragg reflections observed by neutron scattering are due to a modulation of the amplitude ( `` stripes '' ) @xcite or the direction ( `` spirals '' ) @xcite of the ordered moments , or both .",
    "nonetheless , we refer to this state as a `` spin density wave '' ( sdw ) , taking account of the observation that the incommensurate magnetic order in  develops out of a metallic state , in contrast to the commensurate antiferromagnetic order in the mott - insulating state at lower doping levels .",
    "the amplitude of the sdw modulation is strongly enhanced by a modest magnetic field @xmath27 t @xcite .",
    "it is thus very likely that the same sdw state is present at the much higher fields used in the quantum oscillation experiments on crystals with slightly higher doping levels . a reconstruction of the fermi surface by the sdw is then expected on general grounds .",
    "subsequent work has confirmed that the size of the fermi surface pockets observed in  can be quantitatively explained based on the incommensurate wave vector we have determined @xcite .",
    "an investigation of the temperature dependence of the magnetic structure and dynamics of  has revealed that the magnetic order disappears in a two - step fashion upon heating @xcite . in a first step ,",
    "muon spin relaxation ( @xmath16sr ) experiments showed that static magnetic order , which reduces the translational symmetry of the lattice , vanishes at a temperature @xmath28 k. in a second step , the incommensurate wave vector characterizing low - energy magnetic fluctuations continuously approaches the commensurate antiferromagnetic ordering wave vector with increasing temperature , and the incommensurability vanishes in an order - parameter - like fashion at @xmath29 k. while the magnetic fluctuations above @xmath23 respect the fourfold rotation symmetry of the cuo@xmath0 plane , their wave vector spontaneously aligns with one of the two nearly equivalent copper - oxygen bond directions upon cooling below this temperature . in a wide temperature regime , therefore , the spin system collectively behaves in such a way that the rotational symmetry is broken while the translational symmetry remains intact . since the symmetry properties of this state are analogous to those of a nematic liquid crystal , we refer to this state as an `` electronic liquid - crystal '' ( elc ) @xcite .",
    "the small orthorhombicity of the  crystal lattice is required to align the elc domains such that the elc state becomes observable in a volume - integrating method such as neutron scattering . in the presence of this aligning field",
    ", the elc transition is rounded into a sharp crossover . while the neutron scattering data are not accurate enough to quantify this rounding , the strong , order - parameter - like temperature dependence of the incommensurability indicates that the loss of rotational symmetry reflects an underlying phase transition that is driven by collective interactions between the spins .",
    "our work on  raises several questions .",
    "how is the incommensurate sdw related to the magnetic order observed in , and how does it evolve into the commensurate antiferromagnetic order @xcite observed in  at lower doping levels ? how is the elc state related to anomalies in the charge dynamics observed by transport ( such as nernst effect measurements @xcite ) and spectroscopic probes ( such as infrared spectroscopy @xcite ) in the same temperature and doping range ?",
    "this article describes neutron scattering measurements on untwinned  crystals with @xmath30 and @xmath31 designed to address these questions , and to constrain theoretical models of the collective magnetic ordering phenomena in the cuprates . in conjunction with measurements on @xmath32 and higher",
    "doping levels , the results allow us to determine the doping dependence of the incommensurate wave vector as well as the characteristic crossover temperatures for sdw and elc ordering in . for a  crystal , we also present data on the magnetic field dependence of the sdw order parameter at low temperatures , as well as temperature dependent neutron resonant spin - echo experiments that bridge the gap in energy scales between @xmath16sr and conventional neutron diffraction data .",
    "the results of our study allow us to draw an outline of the phase diagram of underdoped  as a function of doping , magnetic field , and temperature .",

    "several tens of crystals were co - aligned on a single - crystalline silicon disc by x - ray laue diffractometry .",
    "the resulting crystal arrays , mimicking large single - domain crystals , had mosaicities of @xmath40 and a majority twin domain population close to 90% .",
    "the contribution of the minority twin domains to the observed magnetic scattering signal is thus below the detection limit .",
    "the neutron experiments were performed at the triple - axis spectrometers in8 and in14 ( ill , grenoble , france ) , 4f1 and 4f2 ( llb , saclay , france ) , rita - ii ( sinq , psi villigen , switzerland ) , and on the resonant spin - echo triple - axis spectrometer trisp ( frm - ii , garching , germany ) .",

    "it is interesting to note that the qcp indicated by our neutron scattering study coincides with the insulator - metal transition inferred from transport experiments in high magnetic fields @xcite , and that the transport data indicate a critical divergence of the cyclotron mass at this doping level @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive explanation of the neutron - scattering and quantum - oscillation data therefore requires a transition from `` sdw insulator '' to `` sdw metal '' at high fields @xcite , for which there is thus far no direct experimental evidence .",
    "going back to the zero - field phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ figure8]a , we note that the elc onset temperature also increases with decreasing @xmath33 , such that the elc and sdw crossover lines are nearly parallel . in view of the minute size ( @xmath110 for ) and opposite doping trend of the orthorhombic distortion of the crystal structure @xcite",
    ", this observation supports our contention @xcite that the anisotropy is not a simple consequence of the crystal symmetry @xcite , but arises spontaneously from many - body interactions between spins .",
    "the elc onset temperature is substantially lower than the onset of the `` charge pseudogap '' detected by infrared spectroscopy @xcite , which at these doping levels is well above room temperature .",
    "however , it coincides with the onset of signatures of phase - incoherent superconductivity in the infrared spectra of  samples from the same batch as ours @xcite .",
    "the theoretical description of the subtle interplay between superconducting and spin correlations for @xmath111 is an interesting subject of further investigation , as is the relationship between the elc phenomenon reported here and the spontaneous onset of in - plane anisotropies in @xmath112 resistivity @xcite and nernst effect @xcite measurements . while the temperature evolution of the in - plane resistivity anisotropy @xcite is in good qualitative agreement with the anisotropy of the spin dynamics shown in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] , corresponding nernst - effect data are not yet available for the doping levels investigated here .    finally , it will be important to follow the elc crossover line to higher doping levels , where the sdw phase is no longer present at @xmath88 . for  ( @xmath113 ) , the spin excitation spectrum exhibits a gap in the superconducting state at @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "weak low - energy spin excitations are present above @xmath35 , but their temperature dependence has not yet been studied in detail . the intensity of higher - energy excitations with @xmath114 mev , however , shows a strong upturn upon cooling below @xmath115 k @xcite , in qualitative agreement with transport @xcite and infrared @xcite data . taken together , these results suggest that the elc phenomenon persists at least up to @xmath113",
    ". it will be interesting to explore the relationship between this transition and the `` spin pseudogap '' detected by nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite , as well as the magnetic reflections with @xmath116 detected by elastic neutron scattering @xcite in this doping regime .",
