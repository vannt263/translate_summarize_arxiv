    "almost all materials become stiffer when compressed , as a result of the constituent atoms being squeezed together .",
    "it therefore comes as something of a shock that some materials  among them amorphous silica @xcite , zrw@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite and zn(cn)@xmath0 @xcite  actually become _ softer _ under compression .",
    "formally , the stiffness is defined through the zero - pressure bulk modulus @xmath2 , and the change in stiffness is defined through the differential @xmath3 , which is a positive quantity for almost all materials . however , in these cited examples it is found that @xmath4 has a negative value .",
    "there is as yet no theoretical explanation for this effect , which can be called `` pressure - induced softening '' , but in a simulation study of pressure - induced softening in amorphous silica @xcite we drew attention to the role of fluctuations involving whole - body rotations of sio@xmath5 tetrahedra .",
    "given that the same fluctuations are implicated in the similarly counter - intuitive phenomenon of negative thermal expansion ( nte ) @xcite , and given that the few materials in which pressure - induced softening has been identified also show nte , we suggest that most nte materials will show pressure - induced softening , and in this paper we demonstrate the plausibility of this hypothesis .",
    "the basis for linking pressure - induced softening with negative thermal expansion can be understood by considering the relatively simple example of zn(cn)@xmath0.@xcite its perfect structure has linear zn ",
    "c  n  zn linkages of bonds along the crystallographic @xmath6 directions . uniform compression of the perfect structure will force compression of these bonds , which are stiff and will become stiffer on further compression .",
    "hence at a temperature of 0 k , or in a static lattice energy calculation , we might expect to find a positive value of @xmath4 .",
    "however , on heating thermal fluctuations will cause instantaneous buckling of the zn  c  n  zn linkages  a process aided by the fact that the rigid - unit - mode flexibility of the structure allows for localised distortions @xcite  so that an external compressive force can be accommodated with relatively low energy cost by further buckling without the need to compress the individual bonds .",
    "if we now consider the case of stretching the structure ( application of negative pressure ) , the stretch will first be accommodated by reducing the buckling of the linkages of bonds , but when the buckling has been stretched out the second process is to stretch the individual bonds .",
    "this will cost a lot more energy , and the volume change per unit of stretch force will reduce .",
    "this means that the bulk modulus will increase on stretching , and hence we have a negative value of @xmath4 .    because the fluctuations that buckle the linkages give rise to a reduction in crystal volume in many framework , and because their amplitude increases with temperature , we have the possibility  perhaps in some cases inevitability  for negative thermal expansion .",
    "thus we might expect pressure - induced softening to be linked to nte .",
    "put another way , we might expect that many nte materials will also show pressure - induced softening . in the case of zn(cn)@xmath0 , experimentally it is found to have large nte , and a negative value of @xmath4 , i.e.  pressure - induced softening.@xcite our recent simulation study of zn(cn)@xmath0 @xcite is consistent with the experimental data @xcite and shows that @xmath4 has a dependence on temperature of the form described above .",
    "in this paper we test the proposal of a direct link between nte and pressure - induced softening by performing simulation experiments on the full suite of zeolites with cubic lattice symmetry @xcite .",
    "zeolites are low - density framework structures built from corner - linked sio@xmath5 tetrahedra , many of which are found naturally with ionic substitution on the tetrahedral site ( e.g.  al for si ) with associated charge - balancing cations ( e.g.  na ) found in the large pores in the structure .",
    "it has long been recognised that some zeolites show nte @xcite , although there has not yet been a systematic study of the set of the cubic zeolites . here",
    "we make two predictions , first that most cubic zeolites will show nte , and second , based on the preceding discussion , that those that do have nte will also show pressure - induced softening .",
    "this is much easier tested by molecular dynamics simulation than experiment , and for siliceous zeolites we have some good force fields derived from quantum mechanical calculations and tested in many independent studies .",
    "there are 13 candidate zeolites with crystal structures of cubic symmetry and fully connected sio@xmath5 tetrahedra , all of which are investigated in the current work . for reference for the rest of this paper , we note that all zeolites are assigned a three - letter name@xcite , sometimes which relates to a historical name ( e.g.  ana for analcime , fau for faujisite ) .",
    "the thermodynamic theory to link nte with pressure - induced softening is derived in section ii .",
    "section iii gives the computational method and section iv presents the main results .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section v.",
    "the helmholtz free energy of an insulating crystal @xcite in the classical high - temperature approximation is written as    @xmath7    where the first term on the right - hand side is the lattice energy of the crystal at zero temperature .",
    "the second term involves the sum over all wave vectors @xmath8 on all branches of the phonon dispersion curves @xmath9 , with @xmath10 as the frequency of each phonon mode denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the temperature in the unit of energy .    at equilibrium ,",
    "the pressure @xmath13 is obtained as the derivative of the free energy with respect to the crystal volume @xmath14 :    @xmath15    the overall grneisen parameter @xmath16 is defined as the sum over all the mode grneisen parameters @xmath17 :    @xmath18    with @xmath19 as the total number of atoms in the system .",
    "the bulk modulus of the material can be calculated using    @xmath20    where we have used    @xmath21    thus ,    @xmath22    from equation  [ eq13 ] , we can obtain the first derivative of the bulk modulus with respect to pressure as    @xmath23    in equation  [ eq14 ] , we have used the approximation    @xmath24    which is generally valid for the zeolites we have studied here , as will be seen in table  [ table1 ] in section v. according to this , from equation  [ eq13 ] , one has    @xmath25    accordingly , we can rewrite equation  [ eq14 ] in the more compact form    @xmath26,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the first term on the right - hand side , namely    @xmath27    is the value of @xmath28 at zero temperature obtained in a harmonic - lattice - dynamics calculation . in our case , we will calculate this term for all the cubic nte zeolites in harmonic lattice dynamics using a force field with the buckingham potential .",
    "thus , according to equation  [ eq18 ] , if @xmath29 is positive , given that all the rest terms are negative , @xmath28 may become negative when the temperature is high enough .",
    "in fact , since nte materials have negative coefficient of thermal expansion , one should have    @xmath30    and we will see in section v , that for all the cubic nte zeolites ,    @xmath31    note that , if @xmath16 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are in the same order of magnitude , the term containing @xmath33 will contribute dominantly to a negative @xmath28 due to its large coefficient involving the bulk modulus @xmath34",
