    "the role of the @xmath0-resonance in baryon chiral perturbation theory ( bchpt ) has been an old and interesting topic since the beginning of the 90s@xcite , and its importance is related to the proper formulation of the effective field theory .",
    "this is because the @xmath0 couples strongly to the @xmath1 system already at low energies , what translates into a strong influence of this resonance in the @xmath1 scattering process even at very low energies .",
    "this motivates , from the phenomenological point of view , the explicit inclusion of this resonance , since one can expect that it will play an important role as an active degree of freedom in an effective field theory of @xmath1 scattering . through this inclusion ,",
    "one keeps a proper separation of scales and can extend the range of validity of the perturbative treatment.@xcite on the other hand , one can also justify this inclusion invoking large @xmath2 limit arguments since , in the emerging spin - flavor symmetry , nucleons and deltas are part of the same mutliplet.@xcite",
    "the possible ways to incorporate the @xmath0 in chiral effective field theory ( eft ) have been the subject of intensive research .",
    "some crucial questions that one must address are : 1 ) how to filter the unphysical degrees of freedom introduced by the rarita - schwinger ( rs ) field that represents the @xmath3 , and 2 ) how to deal with the new scale @xmath4 , i. e. , redefine a counting that takes into account the mass splitting @xmath5 . for the results that we will show here , we employed the consistent formulation of chiral lagrangians@xcite in combination with the @xmath6-counting.@xcite another issue related to chiral effective field theory with baryons is how to keep explicitly lorentz invariance in the formulation without breaking the standard chiral counting .",
    "here we employ the extended - on - mass - shell scheme@xcite ( eoms ) , which will be an important ingredient in the correct extraction of the @xmath1 scattering observables.@xcite this allow us to overcome some problems that the heavy baryon ( hbchpt ) and infrared regularization ( ir ) formulations have in extracting some important information related to @xmath1 scattering phenomenology . in the following",
    "we will show how the inclusion of the @xmath3 in the eoms renormalized bchpt allow us to exploit the theory to obtain valuable information directly from experimental data .",
    "this eoms renormalized approach is what we call covariant bchpt .",
    "in this section we summarize some important results obtained from the inclusion of the @xmath3 in covariant bchpt . the crucial improvement achieved by this approach",
    "is directly related to the convergence of the chiral series , which translates into an improved description of the physical and the subthreshold regions .",
    "also , we obtained a better convergence in the chiral expansion of the extracted quantities related to @xmath1 scattering.@xcite such improved convergence is not observed , however , in the ir formulation@xcite .",
    "notice that the lack of convergence in the subthreshold region in previous analyses questioned the applicability of bchpt to @xmath1 scattering.@xcite    in the following we concentrate in two practical applications of our calculation : the extraction of the pion - nucleon sigma term ( @xmath7 ) from @xmath1 scattering data and its impact on the calculation of the strangeness content of the nucleon ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the pion - nucleon sigma term is a quantity that contains information about the internal scalar structure of the nucleon which is used in a broad variety of nuclear - physics calculations.@xcite however , it has become more known due to its impact on estimations of direct detection of dark matter@xcite , since it is related to the scalar coupling of the nucleon :    @xmath9    since this quantity has a direct impact on @xmath1 scattering , it is possible to extract it in a model - independent way from a bchpt calculation of this process .",
    "this has been already attempted in previous works , but the lack of convergence did not allow to give a reliable estimation of @xmath7 .",
    "however , this problem can be overcome in the covariant approach of bchpt including the @xmath3-resonance.@xcite in this way one is able to extract a reliable value for @xmath7 employing only experimental information .",
    "we report , from modern @xmath1 scattering data , a value of@xcite    @xmath10    this result , on the other hand , is compatible with updated @xmath1-scattering phenomenology and modern pionic atoms data@xcite , and also with a recent calculation based on @xmath11 lqcd world data.@xcite      the value of @xmath7 deduced from scattering data has a direct impact on the strangeness content of the nucleon , defined as    @xmath12    since the deviation of @xmath7 from the non - singlet contribution to the nucleon mass    @xmath13    is proportional to @xmath8.@xcite the calculation of @xmath8 through @xmath14 has the important advantage that the latter can be obtained from the octet mass splittings.@xcite in fact , with this method gasser extracted from the hadron spectrum a value of @xmath15  mev using a pre - chpt model for the interaction of the baryon with the meson cloud.@xcite on the other hand , a later calculation in @xmath16 hbchpt obtained a value of @xmath17  mev.@xcite however , it is important to take into account that hbchpt has a poor convergence in the @xmath16 sector and also that the decuplet can play an important role in the final value of @xmath14.@xcite notice the importance of an accurate determination of this quantity in the final evaluation of @xmath8 through @xmath14.@xcite for this reason , we updated the value of @xmath14 with a covariant bchpt calculation including the contribution of the decuplet .",
    "we obtained a result of @xcite    @xmath18    which implies ,    @xmath19    for a @xmath20  mev .",
    "this result , obtained uniquely from experimental information , is in good agreement with the lqcd estimations for the strangeness in the nucleon , that also point to a small content.@xcite such a good agreement is not obtained , however , from the classical value of @xmath21  mev,@xcite from where one obtains @xmath22  mev.@xcite",
    "based on our analyses of @xmath1 scattering with and without the @xmath0 included explicitly as a degree of freedom in bchpt within the ir and eoms schemes@xcite , we analyzed which framework exploits better the possibilities of the theory to study the @xmath1-scattering process .",
    "we found that , in order to achieve the best convergence properties , it is crucial to combine a consistent inclusion of the @xmath0 resonance together with a renormalization scheme that preserves the analytical properties of a covariant calculation ( eoms ) .",
    "once this is done , the calculated chiral amplitude shows an improved convergence that allow us to extract reliably the @xmath1 scattering phenomenology at low energies and below the threshold.@xcite this better convergence allowed us to solve previous disagreements with dispersive methods that questioned the applicability of bchpt to the study of @xmath1 scattering.@xcite also , as commented in sec .",
    "[ sec : pinscatteringphenomenolgy ] , this improvement allowed us to extract reliably and accurately the value of @xmath7 and @xmath8 employing only experimental information .",
    "these were found to be compatible with updated phenomenology@xcite and recent lqcd determinations.@xcite we can conclude then , that the inclusion of the @xmath0 resonance in covariant bchpt is very important to exploit the potential of chiral effective field theory with baryons .",
