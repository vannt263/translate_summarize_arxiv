    "the general problem of the relevance of microscopic dynamics to the statistical behaviour of physical systems dates back to boltzmann s ideas at the very beginning of statistical mechanics , and is still far from being clarified and solved . within this framework",
    ", one can extract a less general but still challenging question , i.e. whether the microscopic hamiltonian dynamics displays some relevant change when a given system undergoes a phase transition .",
    "studying microscopic hamiltonian dynamics means that  instead of using _ ensemble _ statistical averages ",
    "one numerically computes _ time _ averages of the relevant observables .",
    "there are two main reasons for so doing : _",
    "i ) _ there exist interesting observables that are intrinsically dynamical , as is the case of lyapounov exponents ; _ ii ) _ through a differential - geometric description of the dynamics , based on simple tools of riemannian geometry , new concepts and methods come to enrich the standard approaches to the study of phase transitions , hinting to a possibly deeper characterization of their very nature from the standpoint of the mathematical structures involved .",
    "the geometric formulation of the dynamics of many - degrees - of - freedom systems was first used by krylov in his pioneering studies on the dynamical foundations of statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "then , during the last two decades , there have been some attempts to cope with the ergodicity of hamiltonian systems through a geometric theory of dynamics @xcite .",
    "a more recent series of papers @xcite , instead of dealing with ergodicity , successfully addresses the problem of explaining and quantifying hamiltonian chaos within a geometric framework where natural motions are seen as geodesics of a suitable riemannian manifold ( henceforth referred to as `` mechanical manifold '' ) . here",
    "chaotic dynamics stems from curvature fluctuations along the geodesics , through a mechanism similar to the parametric destabilization of the stable orbits of a pendulum . at variance with a widespread belief , negative curvatures",
    "do not appear essential to produce chaos , positive and fluctuating curvatures can work as well .",
    "a very interesting point is that the average degree of instability of the dynamics is given in terms of curvature - related quantities integrated over the whole `` mechanical manifold '' .",
    "this establishes a link between a _",
    "dynamical _ aspect of a given system  the stability / instability of its trajectories  and some _ global geometric _ properties of its associated `` mechanical manifold '' .",
    "now , when a model system displays a phase transition , a natural question arises : what kind of relationship exists  if any  between all the well - known major thermodynamic changes occurring at the transition point and the mentioned global geometric characteristics of the `` mechanical manifolds '' ?",
    "the present work actually shows that a second order phase transition appears to be associated with an abrupt change in the global geometry  and possibly in the topology , as we conjecture  of the `` mechanical manifolds '' .",
    "the above problematics is addressed in the present work by studying the dynamics of classical field theories , discretized on a lattice .",
    "a classical lattice field theory can be regarded as a discrete classical dynamical system . in particular",
    ", we shall consider the classical @xmath0 theory , whose lattice version is a set of coupled nonlinear oscillators .",
    "equilibrium phase transitions are usually studied in the framework of the gibbsian canonical ensemble .",
    "dynamics , when it is considered , is introduced only _ a posteriori _ : the most common procedure is to describe it by means of non - deterministic equations , usually of the langevin type , whose limiting probability distribution is the boltzmann weight @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "here we are going to adopt a completely different approach , i.e. from the very beginning we consider the deterministic hamiltonian dynamics , without making explicit assumptions on the equilibrium properties of the system , and we observe how the phase transition is signaled by the dynamics . on rigorous grounds , one can not be sure that a phase transition does exist in a system studied through its hamiltonian dynamics , because there is no proof of the fact that the dynamics is ergodic .",
    "moreover , even assuming that it is ergodic , the ergodic measure will be the microcanonical rather than the canonical one .",
    "the two ensembles are equivalent only in the thermodynamic limit , thus the phenomenology observed in finite systems , as the systems considered in numerical simulations necessarily are , might be different . to give only an example ,",
    "let us consider the phenomenon of _ ergodicity breaking _",
    "i.e. the fact that ergodicity is not valid for the whole phase space but only for disjoint subsets of it .",
    "such a phenomenon is indeed tightly related to phase transitions ; in fact , when it occurs it entails a symmetry breaking , as in usual phase transitions .",
    "but ergodicity breaking is a more general concept than symmetry breaking , in fact it is also at the origin of those phase transitions which do not correspond to the breaking of an evident symmetry of the hamiltonian ( for example in spin glasses ) @xcite . in the canonical ensemble",
    ", ergodicity can be broken only in the thermodynamic limit @xcite , while in the microcanonical ensemble , in principle , there might be ergodicity breaking also in finite systems .",
    "ergodicity being a dynamical property , we think that a dynamical approach is particularly appropriate to study such a phenomenon .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that ergodicity breaking in classical hamiltonian systems can be related with supersymmetry breaking @xcite ; this relation is estabilished within the framework of a path - integral formulation of classical mechanics , where the bosonic sector of a supersymmetric lagrangian is given by a suitable function of the canonical coordinates , obeying standard hamilton equations , and the fermionic sector contains ghost fields that - rather surprisingly - obey the jacobi equation describing the stability of classical paths @xcite . in this framework",
    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking can occur also at finite volume @xcite .",
    "our results show that , as far as the lattice @xmath0 models considered are concerned , the numerical phenomenology , obtained by simulating hamiltonian dynamics , is perfectly consistent with the expectations based on equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "moreover , we investigate whether the instability of dynamical trajectories , measured by lyapounov exponents , is sensitive to the phenomenon of phase transition @xcite . in the light of the geometrization of dynamics ,",
    "lyapounov exponents are also seen as probes of the hidden geometry of motion , and in fact our results suggest that the deep origin of ergodicity breaking and of the dynamical counterpart of a phase transition could be found in a major change in the geometric  or even topologic  structure of the `` mechanical manifolds '' underlying the dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec_phenomenology ] we introduce the models studied , we describe the numerical techniques which we adopted , and we discuss the phenomenology of the phase transition as it emerges from the dynamics . in section [ geometry ] the main definitions and results of the riemannian description of hamiltonian chaos are given , and the behaviour of the geometric observables in our models is presented and discussed together with an interpretation involving simple topological concepts . section [ sec_comments ] is devoted to some remarks and comments .",
    "to study the relationship between microscopic dynamics and equilibrium phase transitions we consider hamiltonian systems of the standard type @xmath5 = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\bf i } \\pi_{\\bf i}^2 +   v(\\{\\varphi_{\\bf i}\\ } ) ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are canonically conjugated coordinates and momenta , @xmath8 labels the sites of a @xmath9-dimensional cubic lattice , and @xmath10 is an interaction potential .",

    "this quantity shows a fast convergence in time and is expected to differ from its canonical counterpart by a @xmath62 correction .    besides the bifurcation of the order parameter  @xmath63  at some critical value of the temperature , a second order phase transition is signaled by a singular temperature dependence of the specific heat , and therefore the microcanonical computation of the constant volume specific heat @xmath64 deserves special care .",
    "an efficient numerical method to compute @xmath64 is devised by inverting a general formula relating canonical and microcanonical averages of the squared fluctuations of a generic observable @xcite by applying it to the fluctuations of kinetic energy @xmath65 where @xmath66 ; overbar and hat stand for microcanonical and canonical averages respectively .",

    ", a phase transition may show up only in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "as long as @xmath60 is finite , all the thermodynamic quantities are regular functions of the temperature , and ergodicity and symmetry are not broken .",
    "nevertheless , some marks of the transition show up neatly also in a finite system .",
    "the specific heat does not diverge , but exhibits a peak  whose height grows with the size of the system  at a temperature @xmath72 . in principle",
    "the order parameter is expected to vanish on the whole temperature range for any finite value of @xmath60 , though in practice , e.g. , in a canonical montecarlo simulation where the length of the sampling of @xmath73 is necessarily finite , the system is trapped in one of the two phases for a `` time '' which grows exponentially with @xmath60 @xcite , and thus a fictitious symmetry breaking is observed at a temperature @xmath74 .",
    "this temperature , in general , does not coincide with @xmath72 , even if @xmath75 in the microcanonical ensemble ergodicity breaking may occur also at finite @xmath60 , hence we can expect that a `` true '' critical energy exists also at finite @xmath60 .",
    "no rigorous theoretical result is at our disposal regarding this aspect .",
    "nevertheless , on the basis of asymptotic equivalence of statistical ensembles , the behaviour of microcanonical thermodynamic functions is reasonably expected to be similar to the canonical case , at least as @xmath60 is sufficiently large .",
    "indeed this is what is observed , as we shall see in the following . in particular",
    ", we expect the specific heat to exhibit a peak at a critical energy density which is a function of @xmath60 .    in the framework of the statistical theory of critical phenomena , by means of the finite - size scaling analysis @xcite the critical properties of the infinite system",
    "are inferred from the values of the thermodynamic observables in finite samples of different sizes . in particular",
    "it is possible to locate the critical point by means of the so - called _ binder cumulants _ @xcite .",
    "the binder cumulant @xmath76 that we have computed for our systems is defined as @xmath77 where @xmath78 in the disordered phase the probability distribution of the order parameter will be nearly gaussian with zero mean , hence @xmath79 . at variance to this , at zero temperature ( or energy ) , when @xmath80 with no fluctuations , @xmath81 . at different sizes of the system",
    ", @xmath76 will decay following different patterns @xmath82 from @xmath83 to @xmath84 at increasing temperature .",
    "the remarkable fact is that the value of @xmath76 at @xmath85 is _ independent _ of @xmath60 , provided @xmath60 is large enough for the scaling regime to set in ; hence the critical point can be located by simply looking at the intersection of the different curves @xmath82 for different values of @xmath60 . in principle , two different sizes are sufficient to locate the transitions ; in practice , owing to the unavoidable numerical errors which affect @xmath76 , it is necessary to consider at least three values of @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath76 at the critical point , usually referred to as @xmath86 , is a universal quantity , like the critical exponents ; for a simple proof see e.g. ref .",
    "the importance of the binder cumulant method is not only that it allows to easily locate the critical temperature , without the need of an extrapolation of the asymptotic behaviour of the fictitious finite-@xmath60 critical temperatures , but also that such an estimate of @xmath87 is independent of the other thermodynamic observables like @xmath88 or @xmath64 , and this is obviously a great advantage in determining the actual critical behaviour  in particular the critical exponents .",
    "moreover , one can regard the existence of a crossing of different curves @xmath82 as a `` proof '' for the existence of a phase transition in the system under investigation .",
    "this may be useful in various cases where the presence of singularities in the thermodynamic functions or the existence of a nonzero order parameter are difficult to observe ( e.g. this is the case of spin glasses @xcite ) .",
    "the theory behind the binder cumulant method is totally internal to _ canonical _ statistical mechanics : to our knowledge no extension of this theory to the _ microcanonical _ ensemble exists .",
    "nevertheless we will adopt the pragmatic point of view of assuming its validity as a numerical tool also in our dynamical simulations , and our operative definition of the critical energy density @xmath89 will be the intersection point of the curves @xmath90 at different @xmath60 .",
    "the consistency of the method will be checked _ a posteriori_. in the following ,",
    "unless explicitly stated otherwise , @xmath91 and @xmath92 will denote respectively @xmath89 and @xmath87 .",
    "the results for @xmath93 at different sizes for the @xmath0 lattice models are shown in figs.[fig1]@xmath94 .",
    "the crossing of the various curves at @xmath95 for the @xmath20 model is quite evident , and similarly at @xmath96 for the @xmath29 model , and at @xmath97 for the @xmath30 model .",
    "such estimates of the critical energy densities are obviously far from being extremely accurate .",
    "however , we are mainly interested in showing that the dynamical phenomenology is actually consistent with the existence of an equilibrium phase transition at finite energy density , and the values of @xmath91 are needed to understand whether or not the singular ( or , more generally , peculiar ) behaviours of the observables  either thermodynamical , or strictly dynamical , or geometric ones  that we are going to study can be associated with the phase transition .",
    "the temperature of the @xmath0 systems , numerically determined according to eq .",
    "( [ temperatura ] ) , is plotted in fig.[fig2 ] as a function of the energy density @xmath98 .",
    "note that for all the models a change of the function @xmath99 is clearly evident at @xmath100 .    by plotting the binder cumulants _ vs. _ the temperature @xmath101 , the critical values @xmath92 are obtained for all the models and are found in complete agreement with the outcomes of the @xmath102 curves .",
    "these values are : @xmath103 for the @xmath20 model , @xmath104 for the @xmath29 model , and @xmath105 for the @xmath30 model .",
    "the specific heat @xmath106 per degree of freedom of the @xmath0 models here considered , computed according to eq .",
    "( [ formulalpv ] ) , is plotted _ vs. _ the temperature in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the asymptotic values of the specific heat in the limits @xmath107 and @xmath108 are exactly known .",
    "in fact at low energies the anharmonic terms in the hamiltonian can be neglected , thus the system behaves as a collection af harmonic oscillators and @xmath109 as @xmath110 . in the high - energy limit",
    "the quadratic terms in the potential are negligible with respect to the quartic ones , whence @xmath111 as @xmath112.[limcalspec ] at intermediate energy densities , neat peaks show up whose positions are close to @xmath92 for each model respectively .",
    "the heights of the peaks are found to grow with @xmath60 and to decrease with @xmath24 .",
    "we have shown that the outcomes of the dynamical numerical simulations of the scalar and vector versions of the lattice @xmath0 model are perfectly consistent with the expectations of the effects of a second order phase transition on a finite sample . as already motivated above",
    ", this first result is non - trivial . up to now",
    "its content is that  for all practical purposes  a dynamical simulation is actually equivalent to a microcanonical one , so that , at sufficiently large @xmath60 , the results are in natural agreement with canonical statistical mechanics .",
    "all these results concern time averages : the time variable , even if not eliminated from the very beginning as in the statistical approach , has been nonetheless integrated out in the averaging procedure .",
    "but we can also wonder what are the properties  if any  that are peculiar to the dynamics and that can be considered relevant to the description of the phase transition itself .",
    "moreover we have already noticed that the phenomenon of ergodicity breaking has a deep dynamical origin , therefore we can try to understand what features are associated to a hamiltonian ergodicity breaking .",
    "the lattice @xmath0 models under investigation are nonintegrable dynamical systems . in the two limits @xmath113 and @xmath114 , these systems become integrable .",
    "the two integrable limits are respectively those of a system of coupled harmonic oscillators and of a system of independent quartic oscillators .",
    "the dynamics is always chaotic over the whole energy range .",
    "nevertheless , in analogy to other nonlinear oscillator systems , by varying the energy we expect that qualitatively different dynamical regimes will be found , characterized by a transition between different behaviours of the largest lyapounov exponent @xmath39 as a function of energy density or , equivalently , temperature .",
    "this phenomenon is attributed to a dynamical transition between weak and strong chaos , it is known as strong stochasticity threshold ( sst ) and is discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in particular",
    ", the following questions naturally arise .",
    "is there any peculiar behaviour of the lyapounov exponent in correspondence with the phase transition ?",
    "is there a transition between strongly and weakly chaotic regimes also in these models , and , in the affirmative case , is there any relationship between these different dynamical regimes and the thermodynamic phases ?",
    "we must say from the very beginning that there are not yet conclusive answers to these questions . the study of a possible relation between chaos and phase transitions is a very recent issue @xcite , and the results so far obtained and reported in the literature range from the claim of the discovery of a `` universal '' divergence in @xmath39 near criticality in a class of models describing clusters of particles @xcite , to the observation that the lyapounov exponent attains its minimum in correspondence with the phase transition in ising - like coupled map lattices @xcite , and to the apparent insensitivity to the liquid - solid phase transition of the lyapounov spectra of hard - sphere and lennard - jones systems @xcite .",
    "our simulation results are plotted in figs.[fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "the @xmath20 case has been studied more extensively than the others because of practical reasons of computational effort ( for example single runs for the @xmath30 model usually required at least two weeks of cpu time on a fast hp 9000/735 computer ) .",
    "the first numerical evidence is that in presence of a second order phase transition a rather sharp and `` cuspy '' transition between different behaviours of @xmath115 is found at @xmath92 ( where the critical values @xmath92 are those determined by means of binder cumulants ) .",
    "moreover , the qualitative behaviour of @xmath115 appears very different in the thermodynamically ordered and disordered regions respectively .",
    "in fact , in the former region @xmath39 rapidly increases with @xmath101 , whereas in the latter region @xmath115 displays an almost flat pattern above @xmath92 ( note that @xmath115 is expected to change again at very large @xmath101 because the dynamics is asymptotically integrable in the limit @xmath112 ; this effect has been numerically checked at very high temperatures and is clearly evident in fig.[fig4 ]  @xmath20 case  at @xmath116 ) .",
    "this suggests that the phase transition has a dynamical counterpart in a passage from a weakly to a strongly chaotic regime .",
    "it is remarkable that the shape of @xmath115 is significantly different in presence or in absence of a second order phase transition .",
    "in fact , in the case of one dimensional lattices with short range interactions  where no phase transition is present  @xmath115 has a very smooth pattern ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this fact has been checked more specifically for the @xmath0 model by computing @xmath115 for the @xmath29 symmetry case on a two - dimensional lattice ; as a consequence of the mermin - wagner theorem , here a second order phase transition is forbidden and in fact this model undergoes an infinite order phase transition ( kosterlitz - thouless - berezinsky ) .",
    "the shape of @xmath115 again displays a major change so that the low and high temperature regimes are very different .",
    "however the transition between these two regimes is now smooth @xcite .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that the average of a _ local _ property of microscopic dynamics  the average instability measured by @xmath39  is sensitive to a _ collective _ phenomenon like a second order phase transition .",
    "it could be argued that in the critical region almost any `` honest '' observable will show a peculiar behaviour and that this reflects the tendency of the statistical measure to become singular at the transition point , regardless of the ensemble chosen . in the framework of equilibrium statistical mechanics",
    "this is certainly true , because gibbs measure is the fundamental mathematical object upon which everything relies . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "also the microcanonical measure , which is the invariant measure of the microscopic hamiltonian dynamics , will have to become singular .",
    "however the microcanonical measure is not the ultimate mathematical entity that can be considered , so that the hamiltonian dynamics approach gives meaning to the question of the possible existence of a _ more fundamental _ phenomenon at the very ground of a phase transition .",
    "lyapounov exponents provide the necessary link to such unexplored land .",
    "the details on this point are given in the next section , where we recall how the geometrization of hamiltonian dynamics proceeds in the language of riemannian geometry , and how average geometric properties of some suitable manifold directly influence the average dynamical instability quantified by @xmath39 .",
    "let us here sketch the main points of the riemannian theory of chaos in physical systems , details can be found in ref.s @xcite .",
    "the trajectories of a dynamical system described by the lagrangian function @xmath117 are geodesics of the configuration space endowed with a proper riemannian manifold structure described by the metric tensor @xmath118a_{ik}({\\bf q})~. \\label{jmetric}\\ ] ] this metric is known as jacobi metric and is defined in the region of the configuration space where @xmath119 . in local coordinates , the geodesic equations on a riemannian manifold are given by @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the proper time and @xmath122 are the christoffel coefficients of the levi - civita connection associated with @xmath123 , i.e. @xmath124 , where @xmath125 ; proper time and physical time are related by @xmath126 . by direct computation ,",

    "the cusp - like behaviour of curvature fluctuations has now disappeared and @xmath226 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath101 ; visibly , something still happens at the transition point ( @xmath227 ) so that this case appears to be `` intermediate '' between no phase transition at all and a second order phase transition .",
    "similar results have been found for planar 2-d and 3-d classical heisenberg models @xcite and in a preliminary investigation of the dual ( gauge ) version of the ising model in 3-d @xcite : the cusp - like behaviour of the curvature fluctuations always shows up when a second order phase transition is present , and the singular point is located at the critical temperature , within the numerical accuracy .    in the light of the riemannian description of hamiltonian chaos given above ,",

    "we make a conjecture about the deep meaning of these singular behaviours shown by @xmath115 and @xmath226 .    as the invariant measure for an autonomous hamiltonian flow is the microcanonical measure on the constant energy surfaces of phase space , our numerical computations of @xmath228 and of @xmath229 are good estimates of the quantities @xmath230 and @xmath226 , i.e. microcanonical averages , that enter eqs .",

    "( though the temperature dependence is correct ) and that steeply increases at high temperatures instead of saturating ( before decreasing again at extremely high @xmath101 ) .",
    "the high temperature result appears particularly bad , however this is only due to the asymptotic growth with @xmath101 of both @xmath231 and @xmath232  given by eqs .",

    "the estimate of the decorrelation time - scale of curvature fluctuations along the geodesics is still somehow rudimental in the above outlined riemannian framework , therefore one expects that some improvement is needed on this point . as a matter of fact",
    ", it is possible to substantially improve the theoretical predictions by simply multiplying the decorrelation time scale @xmath178 of eq.([taufinale ] ) by a constant factor which is model dependent and different below and above @xmath92 .",
    "moreover , at high temperatures , in computing @xmath181 and @xmath233 given in eq.([tau1 ] ) , we have subtracted to @xmath230 and @xmath226 their respective asymptotic behaviours given by eqs .",
    "( [ riccitinf ] ) and ( [ flutt - asint ] ) .",

    "the results are reported in figs.[fig11 ] , [ fig12 ] and [ fig13 ] where it is well evident that the best agreement between theory and numerical experiments is obtained in the @xmath20 case ; a very good agreement is still present at low temperatures for the @xmath29 model and it becomes poorer in the @xmath30 model .",
    "the comparison at @xmath234 suffers  in the cases of @xmath29 and @xmath30  of a restricted range of temperature values ( we focused our attention only to the transition region because of the already mentioned problems ) where subtracting to @xmath230 and @xmath235 their asymptotic values is less meaningful .",
    "however it is not out of place to remind that the theoretical computation of lyapounov exponents is not a routine task at all , and that the approach reported here is at present the only theoretical method available to cope with the computation of @xmath39 .",
    "what is important here is that with some simple and reasonable adjustment the above sketched analysis still applies and yields good results .",
    "refinements of the geometrical theory of chaos are beyond the aim of the present work , rather we are interested in using it as it is at present to get a hold of the deep origin of the peculiarities of the dynamics at a phase transition .",
    "we shall now try to grasp the possible significance of the above reported cusp - like , thus possibly singular , behaviour of the curvature fluctuations at the transition point for the @xmath0 lattice systems . as a first step toward this goal , we shall try to reproduce such a peculiar behaviour of curvature fluctuations in abstract geometric models . a preliminary step in this direction",
    "was already presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , applied to the case of planar spin models .",
    "the choice of a geometric _ toy model _ stems from the following considerations .",
    "weakly and strongly chaotic geodesic flows can `` live '' on homologically trivial manifolds , i.e. , on manifolds that are diffeomorphic to an @xmath60-sphere , in other words , non - trivial topology is not necessary to make chaos , conversely , a sudden topological change in a family of manifolds can abruptly affect their geometric properties and the degree of chaoticity of geodesic flows .",
    "therefore , let us consider  for instance  the two families of surfaces of revolution immersed in @xmath236 defined as follows :    @xmath237    @xmath238    where @xmath239 and @xmath240 .",
    "some members of the two families are depicted in fig .",
    "[ figfamilies ] . in both cases there exists a critical value of the parameter @xmath98 , @xmath241 , corresponding to a change in the _ topology _ of the surfaces .",
    "in particular the manifolds @xmath242 are diffeomorphic to a torus @xmath243 for @xmath244 and to a sphere @xmath245 for @xmath246 . in the other case ,",
    "one has instead a change in the number of connected components : the manifolds @xmath247 are diffeomorphic to _ two _ spheres for @xmath244 and to one sphere for @xmath246 .",
    "computing the euler - poincar characteristic @xmath248 one finds @xmath249 if @xmath244 , and @xmath250 otherwise , while @xmath251 equals either @xmath252 or @xmath253 when @xmath98 is respectively negative or positive .",
    "let us now compute the @xmath98-dependence of the average curvature properties of these surfaces as @xmath254 .",
    "let @xmath255 belong to one of the two families under investigation . the gaussian curvature @xmath256 is given by @xcite @xmath257 where the functions @xmath258 and @xmath259 represent the coefficients of the general form @xmath260 of parametrized surfaces of revolution , and the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath261 . now the fluctuations of @xmath256 are computed as follows @xmath262 where @xmath37 is the area of @xmath255 and @xmath263 is the invariant surface element .",
    "both families of surfaces , in spite of having very different curvature properties on the average in the @xmath242 case as @xmath244 , while the same average curvature is positive and diverging as @xmath113 for @xmath247 . ] , exhibit a singular behaviour in the curvature fluctuation @xmath264 as @xmath254 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figmodels ] .",
    "these results suggest  at a heuristic level  that , from the point of view of the geometric description of the dynamics , a phase transition might correspond to a _ topology change _ in the manifold underlying the motion .",
    "the relevance of topological concepts for the theory of phase transitions has been already emphasized ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) though in a more abstract context . here",
    "we suggest that topological aspects of phase transitions might also concern the manifolds that are `` just behind '' dynamics , and not only those deep mathematical objects that are involved in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our opinion",
    "this subject deserves further investigation to go beyond the heuristic level .",
    "in fact the study of dynamics and of its geometric and topologic counterparts could eventually lead to a better understanding of the nature of ergodicity breaking and thus of the very nature of phase transitions .",
    "let us now summarize the main points of the present work and comment about their meaning .    by studying some classical lattice @xmath0 models that undergo second order or kosterlitz - thouless phase transitions",
    ", it has been found that the natural microscopic dynamics  derived from the hamiltonian functions of these systems  clearly reveals the presence of the phase transition .",
    "the invariant measure of hamiltonian dynamics is the microcanonical measure , equivalent  in the thermodynamic limit  to the canonical measure which is sampled by usual montecarlo algorithms",
    ". therefore one could argue that it is not surprising that hamiltonian dynamics yields the same results of a montecarlo stochastic dynamics . as a matter of fact using hamiltonian dynamics just to sample the microcanonical measure",
    "would not be so interesting , whereas the important point raised by the present work is that hamiltonian dynamics brings about new observables and a new framework to tackle phase transitions .",
    "mainly lyapounov exponents are the new observables intrinsic to the dynamics , and the differential - geometric treatment of dynamical instability is the new framework .    as well as thermodynamic observables , dynamic and geometric observables are sensitive to a second order phase transition which can be recognized through their peculiar `` non - smooth '' behaviours .",
    "the common wisdom on phase transitions suggests that non - smooth behaviours of any observable are expected near the transition point , as a consequence of the tendency of the measure to become singular at @xmath265 in the limit @xmath266 . in the light of our results",
    "we suggest that a deeper explanation might be possible : a major topological change of the `` mechanical '' manifolds could be the common root of the peculiar behaviours of both dynamic and thermodynamic observables in presence of a phase transition . here",
    "topology is meant in the sense of the de rham s cohomology .    on a purely phenomenological ground",
    "it might be surprising that the largest lyapounov exponent , which measures an average _ local _ property of the dynamics , is sensitive to a _ collective _ , and therefore global , phenomenon like a phase transition . in fluids , for example , it is well evident that molecular chaos has nothing to do with the macroscopic patterns of the velocity field .",
    "it is even possible to have chaotic motions of fluid droplets ( lagrangian chaos ) in presence of regular eulerian velocity fields ( i.e. in laboratory reference frame ) .",
    "however , within the riemannian framework outlined in the preceding sections , lyapounov exponents appear tightly related to the geometry of the `` mechanical '' manifolds , and geometry dramatically changes in presence of a major change of topology .",
    "thus our topological conjecture seems to naturally account for this  at first sight counterintuitive  sensitivity of the largest lyapounov exponent to a macroscopic collective phenomenon .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that , at the best of our knowledge , there is only another framework where lyapounov exponents can be , at least in principle , analytically computed .",
    "this is a field - theoretic framework , already mentioned in the introduction @xcite , based on a path - integral formulation of classical mechanics , where lyapounov exponents are seen as expectation values of suitable operators .",
    "there are many interesting points in this framework that could probably reveal a fertile relationship with the riemannian geometric approach which is behind our present work .",
    "let us mention some of them : ergodicity breaking , which - as we discussed in the introduction - is a more general concept than symmetry breaking , in the field - theoretic context appears related to a supersymmetry breaking , moreover this supersymmetry breaking can occur also at finite @xmath60 @xcite ; lyapounov exponents turn out related to mathematical objects that have many analogies with definitions and concepts of the de rham s cohomology theory @xcite what might be useful in future investigations about the relation between lyapounov exponents and topology at a phase transition .",
    "in conclusion we believe that the dynamic approach , besides the conceptual aspects mentioned above , could contribute to complement the standard approaches of statistical mechanics to the description of phase transitions , and it might hopefully be particularly helpful in those cases where these standard methods may encounter some difficulty , as is the case of disordered and frustrated systems , polymers in the continuum , lattice gauge theories where no symmetry - breaking transition occurs .",
