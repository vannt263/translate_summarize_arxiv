    "many two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattice systems on periodic potentials form different ordered structures at low temperatures which may be unstable against thermal fluctuations and the mismatch between the competing periodicities .",

    "are often employed . however , there are important limitations in these approaches . in the former ,",
    "plastic deformations such as dislocations are not taken into account and in the latter , the accessible time and spatial scales may be very limited .",
    "these limitations are particularly important in atomistic simulations of crystalline materials described by microscopic models with complicated interactions , where the time scale is set by the vibrational frequency and consequently relatively small system sizes are often used in numerical simulations .",
    "recently , a phase field crystal ( pfc ) model for pinned lattice systems was introduced @xcite that allows for both elastic and plastic deformations of the lattice .",
    "the model describes the lattice system as a continuous density field in an external pinning potential . in this formulation a free energy functional is introduced which depends on the phase field @xmath2 corresponding to the particle density . in absence of a pinning potential ,",

    "length scales the model naturally includes elastic and plastic deformations and it should be computationally more efficient than particle simulations such as standard molecular dynamics @xcite .    in a previous work @xcite , the phase diagram of the pfc model in a periodic pinning potential with square symmetry",
    "was determined as a function of the pinning strength and lattice mismatch , in the absence of thermal fluctuations .",
    "a numerical minimization procedure was used to determine the different ordered phases and the phase transitions , based on the corresponding dynamical equation of motion for a conserved field . in the present work , we consider the influence of thermal fluctuations and lattice mismatch in the pfc model with pinning .",
    "we first introduce a non - conserved version of the model which is more efficient for equilibrium simulations , such that a constant chemical potential is included in the free energy to fix the average density . with this new version ,",
    "we determine the ground - state phase diagram as a function of lattice mismatch and strength of pinning potential using the corresponding non - conserved dynamical equations of motion .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations are then used to determine the phase diagram as a function of temperature and mismatch near commensurate phases .",
    "the results reveal that the model has a rich phase diagram , which includes commensurate , incommensurate and liquid - like phases with a topology dependent on the type of ordered structure .",
    "in particular , a finite - size scaling analysis of the melting transition for the @xmath0 commensurate phase shows that the thermal correlation length exponent @xmath1 and specific heat behavior are consistent with the ising universality class , which is expected from analytical arguments based on symmetry considerations and landau free - energy expansion .",

    "the free energy associated with the partition function of eq .",
    "( [ part ] ) , which now takes into account thermal fluctuations can not be obtained directly without approximations .",
    "therefore , to obtain the equilibration configurations and average quantities it is necessary to perform numerical simulations and for this purpose we used the mc method .",

    "the field @xmath23 and pinning potential @xmath18 are defined on a square space grid , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ( @xmath28 integers ) , with grid size @xmath29 and grid spacing @xmath30 and with periodic boundary conditions .",

    ", we attempt to change @xmath33 by an small amount @xmath34 with probability @xmath35 , using the metropolis scheme , where @xmath36 is the resulting change in the configurational energy .",
    "simulations were performed using , typically , @xmath37 ranging from @xmath38 to @xmath39 , grid spacing @xmath40 and @xmath41 mc passes for equilibration and equal number of passes for thermal averages . because of the periodic boundary conditions , the length of the system @xmath42 has to be a multiple of the lattice constant of the pinning potential , @xmath43 . this condition imposes a restriction on the values of @xmath44 when calculations are done for fixed @xmath37 and @xmath45 .",
    "thus , to be able to change @xmath44 continuously near a commensurate phase while still keeping the same system size @xmath37 , we choose a variable grid spacing @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is fixed such that @xmath48 ( @xmath49 is an integer ) .",

    "near the phase transitions where long equilibration times are required , we use the exchange mc method ( parallel tempering ) @xcite .",
    "this method is known to reduce significantly the critical slowing down near phase transitions .",
    "recently , it has being used to study glassy incommensurate vortex lattices in 2d superconducting arrays @xcite . in this method , many replicas of the system with different temperatures @xmath53 in a range above and below the critical temperature are simulated simultaneously and the corresponding configurations are allowed to be exchanged with a probability distribution satisfying detailed balance .",
    "the exchange process allows the configurations of the system to explore the temperature space , being cooled down and warmed up , and the system can in principle escape more easily from metastable minima at lower temperatures . without the replica exchange step , the method reduces to conventional mc simulations performed at different temperatures .",
    "the method was implemented by performing mc simulations as described above for each replica at different temperatures , simultaneously and independently , for a few mc passes .",
    "then exchange of pairs of replica configurations at temperatures @xmath53 and @xmath54 and energies @xmath55 and @xmath56 is attempted with probability @xmath57 , where @xmath58 , using the metropolis scheme . we typically used @xmath59 mc passes for equilibration with up to @xmath60 replicas and equal number of mc passes for calculations of average quantities .",
    "the ordered structures in the ground state were obtained by simulations of the dissipative dynamical equations for the phase field @xmath5 , as in the previous work @xcite .",
    "the reason for using this method instead of the mc method described in sec .",
    "iii is that , at very low temperatures , mc simulations turned out to be computationally less efficient due to the low acceptance rate for mc moves .",
    "the dissipative dynamics should evolve the system to the lower - energy state for arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "therefore the determination of the final configurations is equivalent to finding the ground state for the effective hamiltonian in eq .",

    "the phase diagrams were obtained by monitoring the behavior of the structure factor and specific heat as a function of temperature and lattice misfit .",
    "first , the structure factor @xmath72 was calculated from the positions @xmath73 of the local peaks in the field @xmath23 as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the number of peaks . to locate the peak positions @xmath73 for each configuration of @xmath23",
    "we have implemented a computer algorithm @xcite to find the local maxima in @xmath23 based on a particle location algorithm used in digital image processing @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a structure factor can also be defined directly from the field @xmath23 as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the fourier transform of @xmath5 . while the two expressions give similar results the former expression is better for characterizing a structural phase transition as it includes only the ordering of the lattice and does not simultaneously include fluctuations in the amplitude of the @xmath3 as the latter expression does .",

    "[ sfheat]a drops sharply near the temperature where there is a peak in the corresponding specific heat in fig .",

    "a striking feature of the phase diagram is its topology , which is strong dependent on the type of c phase .",
    "this agrees qualitatively with theoretical predictions from simplified models @xcite .",
    "however , the present calculations were not sufficiently accurate to determine the joining of the transition lines near the incommensurate phases in figs .",
    "[ phdc2x2](a ) and ( b ) .",
