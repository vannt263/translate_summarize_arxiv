    "the archival source , [ hfp2000 ] 449 @xcite , has a positional uncertainty of @xmath139 which encompasses the position of the _ chandra _  source .",
    "it is therefore likely that they are the same object .",
    "cxou j011832.4 - 731741 s position coincides with ogle iii source smc121.6 galaxy , which suggests that it is a background agn .",

    "a peak with @xmath140 confidence was detected in the lomb - scargle periodogram at @xmath141 s , however there is no corresponding strong peak in the phase dispersion minimisation periodogram .",
    "analysis of the data with the method used for finding pulsars in _ rxte _ data @xcite reveals a possible periodicity at 282.49 s , approximately twice the value from the lomb - scargle periodogram . in this method",
    "the light curve is folded on the period found in the lomb - scargle to produce a pulse profile .",
    "the pulse profile is then used as a template to subtract the pulsations from the light curve .",
    "a lomb - scargle periodogram is generated for the cleaned light curve , and this power spectrum is subtracted from the original .",
    "the resulting power spectrum shows only the contribution of the pulsar to the lomb - scargle , allowing possible harmonics that may have been lost in the noise to be detected .",
    "the position of cxou j012223.6 - 730848 is consistent with usno - b1.0 0168 - 0053065 ( @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 ) and ogle iii source smc121.4 542 ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "there are no changes detected in the optical light curves .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is described equally well by a power - law with photon index 1.5 and a bremsstrahlung with a temperature of @xmath146 k ( see table [ tab : spec ] ) .",
    "the temperature is poorly constrained and we therefore prefer the non - thermal fit to the data .    the optical magnitude , lack of long - term variability in the optical light curve and the position of the source on the qccd ( see figure [ fig : quantile ] and section 4 ) suggests that this source may not be a pulsar .",
    "the x - ray to optical flux ratio determined using the non - thermal model fit implies that the source is a background agn .",
    "further observations are needed to verify the existence of pulsations and determine the nature of the source .",
    "observations have shown that the smc contains a large number of hmxbs , providing a homogeneous sample with which to investigate the evolution of the smc , and to compare with our galaxy .",
    "the hmxbs are tracers of very young populations and the smc seems to have a particularly prominent young population . to date , studies of the smc have mostly concentrated on the bar of the smc . to obtain a full picture of the history of the smc we need to broaden our study and include the outer regions of the smc .    in this first paper from the smc wing survey we have investigated the x - ray and optical characteristics of the 23 brightest x - ray sources .",
    "the temporal analysis , combined with identification of the optical counterparts , shows that our sample contains four pulsars , two newly detected and two previously known .",
    "the statistical significance of this can not be determined until a full analysis of the entire smc wing survey has been performed .",
    "the other sources include a quasar and possibly two foreground stars .",
    "the classification of the remainder are not conclusive , but the lack of pulsations , long - term periodic variability , optical identifications and x - ray to optical flux ratios imply that they are most likely background agn",
    ". the classifications of several of the sources from the literature would seem to agree with this .",
    "if the preliminary classifications we have presented in this paper are confirmed our results indicate that the spectral hardness and quantile analysis could be used to distinguish between different classes of object ( see below ) .",
    "we have analysed the spectra of the 11 sources that have @xmath147 counts ( see table [ tab : spec ] ) . apart from source # 4 , which is probably a variable star , most of the objects exhibit non - thermal emission .",
    "we have been able to fit the spectra of all four pulsars in our sample , their power - law indices display a limited range of values with an average of 0.5 and standard deviation of 0.2 . in comparison ,",
    "the spectra of the remaining seven sources with @xmath147 counts have softer spectra , with an average photon index of @xmath148 ( excluding # 4 ) .",
    "@xcite found that the distribution of photon indices for smc hmxbs , mainly located in the bar , had an average of @xmath149 .",
    "this is in agreement with the bar pulsars studied by @xcite that have an average photon index of @xmath150 . in general , the pulsars that we have detected in the wing have harder spectra than those in the bar .",
    "it is likely that the pulsars have a higher intrinsic neutral hydrogen column density than the agn , however it is puzzling why the wing pulsars as a group are harder / more absorbed than the bar group .",
    "could the wing pulsars be situated at the back of the smc ?",
    "the work of @xcite would seem to rule out that possibility as they found that the wing lies in front of the main body of the smc .",
    "it is more likely that small number statistics are contributing to the observed division of sources .    a large fraction of our sources are too faint to extract a meaningful spectrum .",
    "by constructing a quantile - based colour - colour diagram we have been able to investigate the spectral properties of all 23 sources in our sample ( see figure  [ fig : quantile ] ) .",
    "our analysis shows that the pulsars we have detected in the wing fall in a distinct group on the qccd .",
    "the location of the bar pulsars from @xcite also seem to fall in the harder part of the diagram , but the separation of sources is less clearly defined , with one source falling amongst the softer sources from the wing",
    ". there does not seem to be anything remarkable about this particular wing pulsar .",
    "the softer sources include an identified star , quasar and possible agn .",
    "the source that appears to sit in the transition region between the majority of the pulsars and the other sources is cxou j011154.2 - 723105 ( source # 18 ) .",
    "this object displays a possible pulsation of 19.52 s , but its optical magnitude and lack of long - term variability seems to rule out a be / x - ray transient , and the nature of the source remains unclear .",
    "the classification of all of the sources will require optical spectroscopy , but the qccd may be a useful tool for distinguishing pulsars from other types of object ( stars , quasars , agn ) for the fainter x - ray sources in the smc wing survey .",
    "we have detected two new pulsars , cxou j010712.6 - 723533 and cxou j010206.6 - 714115 , and observed two previously known pulsars , sxp101 and sxp348 . with the accurate positions provided by _",
