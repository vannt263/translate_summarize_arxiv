    "pulsar emission in the optical regime is generally accepted to be incoherent synchrotron radiation and consequently it should be polarized .",
    "to date most attention has been on linear polarization , in part due to instrumental limitations of most polarimeters @xcite . optical instrumentation , such as the galway astronomical stokes polarimeter ( gasp ) @xcite , are now in a position to measure all of the stokes parameters from pulsars on time - scales from milliseconds to hours .",
    "hence the requirement for a fully self - consistent model for synchrotron radiation in a high magnetic fields .",
    "the original model for synchrotron emission was published in @xmath0 @xcite , with other authors coming to the same conclusions @xcite , albeit generally with slightly different derivation methods .",
    "this model was then further developed in @xmath1 @xcite , and corrections to the model were applied in @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "these corrections do not significantly alter the circular polarization calculations .",
    "an error in the derivation used was found @xmath13 @xcite , but this did not change the model predictions .    the motivation behind the westfold and legg ( hereafter wl ) model of synchrotron radiation was to study the emission from jupiter , with a magnetic field of approximately @xmath14 g. as such , the behaviour of the model was never tested at high magnetic fields .",
    "as pulsars have extremely high magnetic fields ( @xmath15 g ) , it is important to test the model in high magnetic fields before applying it to pulsar emission .",
    "when the incoherent synchrotron emission is calculated at high magnetic fields ( @xmath16 g ) , the wl formulation predicts a circular polarization greater than @xmath17 per cent . as this is in clear contradiction of reality , a new model for the incoherent synchrotron emission",
    "is required .",
    "the most likely reason was in the expansion of the particle pitch angle distribution . in this paper , this is expanded to the next order of magnitude .",
    "the second section of this paper states the predictions of the previous model @xcite , and gives the problems inherent in that model .",
    "the third section goes through the expansion of the particle pitch angle distribution and the differences that this makes to the intensity , linear polarization and circular polarization .",
    "finally , the overall effects of each of the different parameters on the intensity are investigated , and some of the possible implications are discussed , particularly in relation to pulsar emission .",

    "this is clearly unrealistic .",
    "however , all models will only have a certain range of validity , and if the magnetic field at which the circular polarization occurs at extremely high magneitic fields , then the model can still be used for smaller magnetic fields .",
    "the polarization was found to be greater than @xmath17 per cent at approximately @xmath31 to @xmath8 gauss ( fig .",
    "[ percentcircpol ] ) and above , below the surface magnetic field strength of pulsars , but above planetary magnetic fields .",

    "as the model fails at high magnetic fields , a new model is needed to describe the polarization of synchrotron radiation in those fields .",

    "we will examine the results when the distribution of electrons is expanded to a higher order .",
    "as synchrotron radiation comes from a source moving in a cyclic fashion , emission will consist of harmonics of the fundamental gyro - frequency @xmath32 .",
    "following the same formulation as wl , the emission from each harmonic can be shown to be @xmath33 \\exp\\left[in\\left(\\frac{\\omega_b}{b}\\right   ) t\\right]dt \\label{e_nnonretarded}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the expression in brackets is evaluated at the retarded time @xmath34 * where @xmath35 @xcite . *",

    "the particle maintains a constant pitch angle of @xmath42 with respect to the the magnetic field direction . at any particular time",
    "the orbit has a radius of curvature of * _ a_*. now , let the * _ x_*-*_y _ * plane be the instantaneous plane of the orbit of the particle .",
    "now , take the origin of the * _ x_*-axis to be the point where the velocity vector and the observer are in the * _ x_*-*_z _ * plane , and let the * _ y _ * coordinate be in the direction of the radial vector * _ a _ * , with the * _ x _ * coordinate being defined as perpendicular to the _ * y * _ and * _ z _ * coordinates .     to be along the y axis , and @xmath43 as * * _ n_**@xmath44 .",

    "one result is that the level of circular polarization is directly dependant on the magnetic field . as such , measurements of the circular polarization gives some potential constraints to the magnetic field strength of the emission volume .",
    "there is one major constraint to this emission model . in order to obtain emission at high magnetic fields",
    ", the @xmath81 term has to be positive . in general , for small values of @xmath25 , this can be obtained by considering particle pitch angle distributions with positive first derivatives .",
    "so , in this paper the particle pitch angle distribution used @xmath82 .",
    "however , this particle pitch angle distribution does not in general agree with the particle pitch angle distributions that are predicted ( guassian ) .",
    "physically , this type of distribution would result from particles which lose more energy the closer they are to the magnetic field line .",
    "another area of interest would be in pulsar studies .",
    "there are currently a number of different theories about pulsar high - energy / optical emission @xcite which agree on the process of emission , pair production creating a plasma which then emits using synchrotron radiation , but which disagree on the location of the pulsar emission zone . as the magnetic field strength can be correlated with the position in the pulsar magnetosphere , this provides a test to constrain the pulsar emission location .",
    "one method to constrain the pulsar emission locations would be to use an inverse mapping approach , @xcite .",
    "they considered emission from all parts of the magnetosphere , and compared that emission to optical observations .",
    "they found that the majority of the emission came from approximately @xmath83 km from the pulsar surface , where the magnetic field strength is in the range of @xmath84 g. future work would involve incorporating our model into the code and checking if the emission areas change significantly .",
    "the linear polarization predicted by our method is not dependant on the particle pitch angle except in intermediate magnetic fields , and in certain regimes is not dependant on the magnetic field strength .",
    "however , it is very sensitive to the particle power - law index . as such",
    ", it could be possible to constrain the particle power - law index from measurements of the linear polarization .",
    "a combined measure of linear and circular polarization is therefore an important diagnostic tool for determining the geometry of pulsar emission zones .",
    "the relationship between the observed power - law index , and the particle power - law index , is different at high magnetic fields .",
    "this relationship has been accepted as @xmath85 @xcite , however , at high magnetic fields , this relationship changes to @xmath86 in this formulation ( fig .",
    "[ intensitychange ] ) .",
    "hz , the pitch angle distribution is @xmath87 , the particle power - law index is 1.42 , and theta stands for the pitch angle . as can be seen , at approximately @xmath88 g , the slope of the intensity changes from @xmath89 to @xmath90 . ]",
    "there are still a number of issues to be addressed .",
    "the frequencies of interest here are far from the maximal spectral frequency of a single shape .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to note that there could be errors introduced due to the integration going between @xmath91 and @xmath92 rather than over a realistic energy range . investigating the error is beyond the scope of this work . to",
    "first order we can state that the polarisation measurements are correct , as calculating the formula for @xmath93 and @xmath94 @xcite gives a ratio of @xmath95 for the integration over @xmath91 to @xmath92 , and a slowly varying ratio between @xmath95-@xmath96 ( as the magnetic field is increases from @xmath31-@xmath97 ) for the ratio from the exactly calculated values .",
    "lifetime effects also limit the effective energy range - if the energy is below a minimum of @xmath98 then there can be no radiation @xcite . at high magnetic fields",
    "this can be of the order of @xmath99 .",
    "measurements of the linear and circular polarization from pulsars with apparent magnitudes less than @xmath100 is possible with instruments like gasp on @xmath101-m class telescopes .",
    "our predictions can therefore be tested on normal pulsars such as the crab pulsar and on magnetars such as 4u0142 + 61 .",
    "we also develop our inverse mapping approach @xcite to include circular polarization .",
    "we note that for the crab pulsar the maximum linear polarisation is fifteen per cent @xcite , whereas we predict higher values ( @xmath102 per cent ) , consistent with the wl formulation .",
    "this discrepancy requires further investigation and could be due to either the impact of different pitch angle distribution or a more astrophysical explanation .",
    "future work should clarify this .",
