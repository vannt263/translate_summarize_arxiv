    "neutron matter is believed to be an unusual superfluid gas with positive pressure at all densities .",
    "it has been studied in the context of neutron stars for many years .",
    "recent reviews can be found in references @xcite .",
    "however , the subject is rapidly progressing ; the large number of authors in this paper represents the breadth of recent interest .",
    "the interesting properties of neutron matter follow from the fact that the @xmath0 scattering length ( @xmath1 fm ) has a large magnitude , so that the dimensionless parameter @xmath2 at densities @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the fermi momentum given by @xmath5 .",
    "we use @xmath6 @xmath7 to denote the density of nuclear matter in large nuclei . on the other hand ,",
    "the effective range of the @xmath0 interaction ( @xmath8 fm ) is not much smaller than the interparticle distance @xmath9 , in neutron matter at densities of interest .",
    "hence the @xmath0 interaction can not be easily approximated by a zero range @xmath10-function interaction .",
    "realistic models of the @xmath0 interaction have a repulsive core and strong tensor component ; thus simple perturbation theory expansions can not be easily used to describe neutron matter .",
    "in addition , due to the strong @xmath0 attraction in @xmath11 channel , the low - density neutron matter is believed to be an @xmath12wave superfluid , although at higher densities it could be a @xmath13wave superfluid @xcite .",
    "recently it has become possible to study cold dilute fermi gases in atom traps @xcite . in these gases",
    "the interatomic interaction can be approximated by a zero range potential characterized by the scattering length @xmath14 .",
    "the experiments have the ability to tune values of @xmath15 by using feshbach resonances .",
    "these studies essentially probe superfluid gases like neutron matter at very low densities ( @xmath16 fm ) .",
    "density - dependent effective interactions are commonly used in nuclear physics to develop mean - field approximations based on energy - density functionals . in absence of experimental data ,",
    "results of many - body calculations of the equation of state of pure neutron matter @xcite are often used to determine the effective interactions @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we briefly describe the progress in quantum monte carlo calculations of the properties of dilute fermi gases and neutron matter .",
    "section 3 is devoted to quantum monte carlo calculations of neutrons in a potential well aimed to approximate neutron - rich oxygen isotopes .",
    "we discuss effective interactions in neutron matter in section 4 , and conclude in section 5 .",
    "recently it has become possible to calculate the energies and gaps of simple superfluid fermi gases _ ab initio _ from the interparticle interaction , using quantum monte carlo methods @xcite .",
    "the total energy is calculated for @xmath17 particles in a periodic box of volume @xmath18 .",
    "the results for dilute ( effective range @xmath19 ) fermi gas with @xmath20 are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the unit of energy : e_fg= k_f^2  , corresponds to the energy per particle of noninteracting fermi gas .",
    "dimensional arguments show that the energy and gap of dilute superfluid gases scale with @xmath21 when @xmath22 .",
    "the pairing gap @xmath23 is obtained from the difference between results for odd and even @xmath17 ( fig.1 ) .",
    "these studies of dilute superfluid fermi gases have been extended to various values of @xmath15 in the domain @xmath24 .",
    "cubic periodic boxes have shell structure with shell closures at 2 , 14 , 38 , ... for spin-@xmath25 fermions . in dilute gases the pairing removes shell effects when the interaction is attractive and strong enough so that @xmath260.5 . the gap energy defined as : ( n)=e(n)-[e(n-1)+e(n+1 ) ]  ,",
    "odd  n  , does not depend significantly on @xmath17 for @xmath271 . at negative values of @xmath15 ,",
    "the calculated values of @xmath23 are in between the estimates obtained from bcs and gorkov equations @xcite . however , at large positive values of @xmath28 , the gap energy is below the gorkov estimate and approaches @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the energy of the two - body ground state . recall that when the interaction is attractive and @xmath31 , there must be one or more two - body bound states .",
    "as @xmath28 varies from @xmath32 to @xmath33 the character of dilute fermi gases changes from bcs superfluids with weak pairing to diatomic bose gases with bose - einstein condensation .",
    "this transition has been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the pairing in nuclei and neutron matter is much weaker than in the dilute fermi gases with @xmath260.3 .",
    "however , the energy of neutron matter appears to be close to the energy @xmath34 predicted by quantum monte carlo calculations ( fig.1 ) for large @xmath35 , over a wide density range .",
    "most calculations of neutron matter with realistic interactions , carried out since 1970 @xcite , give @xmath36 in the density range @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "the pairing gaps in neutron matter at @xmath39 are sensitive to the details of the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "for example , the gaps predicted from only the scattering length and effective range are much larger than those with realistic models with repulsive cores @xcite .",
    "quantum monte carlo calculations of neutron matter with realistic interactions are much more difficult than those for dilute gases . in order to treat the effects of the spin , tensor and spin - orbit components in the @xmath0 interaction exactly",
    ", one has to sum over all the @xmath40 spin states of the @xmath17 interacting neutrons @xcite .",
    "such green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) calculations are limited to systems with no more than 16 neutrons at present .",
    "methods to sample the spin space using auxiliary fields are also being developed .",
    "these auxiliary field diffusion monte carlo ( afdmc ) calculations @xcite are fairly accurate for pure neutron systems , and can be carried out for much larger values of @xmath17 .    in computations using periodic boxes",
    "the interparticle interaction beyond @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the box length , has to be truncated or approximated .",
    "gfmc calculations @xcite use truncated interactions and estimate the contribution of @xmath43 by approximate methods .",
    "it is small for @xmath44 , but increases rapidly with density .",
    "the studies of pairing gaps in neutron matter have therefore focused on @xmath45 .",
    "the present , preliminary , results are listed in table i.    the effect of shell closure at @xmath46 is obvious in the results shown in table i. the energy of the seventh pair , @xmath47 mev , is much smaller than that of the eighth pair , @xmath48 mev .",
    "calculations with smaller statistical ( monte carlo ) error are necessary to study the dependence of @xmath49 on @xmath17 , in addition to studies of @xmath50 with the afdmc method .",
    "nevertheless the @xmath51 appears to be of order @xmath52 mev .",
    "this value is in excellent agreement with that obtained using realistic bare @xmath0 interactions and the bcs equation , 2.6(1 ) mev .",
    "this agreement is surprising since most estimates @xcite suggested that medium polarization corrections to the bare interaction would suppress the gap by a factor of two or more even at a density of @xmath53 .    the bcs equation predicts a maximum gap of 3 mev at @xmath54 , and the disappearance of the @xmath11 pairing at @xmath55 @xcite",
    ". it would be most interesting to verify these predictions with essentially exact _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    ".preliminary results of quantum monte carlo calculations of the energies of @xmath17 neutrons at density @xmath53 , in a cubic periodic box using the argonne @xmath56 interaction truncated at @xmath41 , in mev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "neutron drops bound in external wells were studied previously with various objectives @xcite .",
    "we are presently exploring the possibility to model neutron - rich oxygen isotopes by neutron drops in a well meant to represent the effect of interactions with the protons .",
    "the model hamiltonian for the isotope with @xmath17 neutrons has the form : h=_i=1,n(-^2_i+v(r_i ) ) + _ i < jn v_ij + _ i < j < k n v_ijk  , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are realistic bare two- , and three - neutron interactions .",
    "the argonne @xmath59 and illinois-2 interactions are used in the present calculations and the single - neutron potential @xmath60 is chosen so that the density distribution of the eight - neutron ground state is close to that of protons in @xmath61o .",
    "it is given by : v(r)=  , in mev and fm units .",
    "this well has only two bound states ; a 0s and a 0p at @xmath62 -12.1 and -4.8 mev respectively .",
    "it can thus bind only 8 noninteracting neutrons . however , bound states of many more interacting neutrons exist in this well due to the @xmath0 attraction .    the calculated energies of the low - energy bound states of up to 14 neutrons are compared with the experimental energies of oxygen isotopes in fig.2",
    ". a constant of -19 mev has been added to the calculated energies to match the energy of the 8-neutron drop with that of @xmath61o .",
    "the results indicate that neutron - rich ( @xmath63 ) oxygen isotopes can be well approximated by neutron drops in a woods - saxon well .",
    "however , the approximation becomes less accurate for neutron - poor ( @xmath64 ) isotopes .",
    "presumably the proton distribution in oxygen isotopes does not change much with @xmath17 when @xmath65 , but when @xmath17 becomes smaller than 8 , the protons become less bound and their distribution changes significantly .    in the traditional shell model , neutron - rich oxygen isotopes",
    "are approximated by @xmath66 neutrons interacting via an effective interaction in the sd - shell .",
    "in contrast the present method uses bare interactions among all the neutrons .",
    "the single - particle potential @xmath60 is meant to represent only the @xmath67 interaction effects .",
    "it can obviously be improved by adding a spin - orbit term to the @xmath60 .    in @xmath68o",
    "the interactions between neutrons give only @xmath69 of the observed @xmath70 spin - orbit splitting , and the three - neutron interaction contributes approximately half of the calculated splitting .",
    "the remaining third must come from the interactions with protons .",
    "the variation of the pairing gap with @xmath17 is being studied in more detail .",
    "density - dependent effective interactions are often used to describe nuclei using the mean - field approximation .",
    "they are mostly used in the hartree , hartree - fock or hartree - fock - bogolubov equations . in principle , parts of such effective interactions which depend only on the density of matter , can be chosen such as to reproduce the @xmath71 and the pairing gap @xmath72 of uniform neutron matter .",
    "the simplest skyrme effective interaction between neutrons is of the form : v_eff(*r , r * ) = b((*r * ) )   ( * r * )  . here",
    "@xmath73 and @xmath74 are the center of mass and relative separation between the two interacting neutrons .",
    "commonly used skyrme interactions have momentum dependent and spin - orbit terms which are omitted here for brevity .",
    "their dependence on the proton density can also be neglected in the present discussion . in the hartree - fock approximation ,",
    "the energy of neutron matter per neutron given by this @xmath75 is : e()=e_fg()+ b ( )  .",
    "the strength of the skyrme interaction @xmath76 can thus be obtained from the @xmath71 of neutron matter .",
    "most realistic calculations of neutron matter give @xmath36 in the density range @xmath77 to 0.1 @xmath7 .",
    "this result is independent of the interaction model and the calculation details @xcite .",
    "it simply follows from the fact that in this density range the @xmath78 .",
    "this implies that : b ( ) ~- e_fg ( ) ~^-1/3  , since @xmath21 is proportional to @xmath79 .",
    "this low - density divergence of the effective @xmath0 interaction is also a consequence of the large magnitude of the @xmath0 scattering length .    in some models @xcite",
    "the neutron - proton effective interaction has a more severe @xmath80 divergence due to the existence of the @xmath67 bound state , the deuteron .",
    "however , this divergence is mostly ignored because matter containing neutrons and protons is unstable at low densities ; it clusters into nuclei .",
    "in contrast the @xmath81 divergence of the effective @xmath0 interaction could have consequences on the structure of neutron - rich nuclei with a neutron halo and in the neutron gas in a neutron - star crust @xcite .",
    "it is known that pairing is very important in determining the structure of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "for example , nuclei with an even number of neutrons dominate the neutron - drip line .",
    "it is not possible to use delta - function effective interactions of finite strength to calculate pairing gaps without restricting the hilbert space . in unrestricted space divergences",
    "occur . in stable nuclei",
    "reasonable values of the gaps may be obtained using the skyrme effective interaction and truncating the hilbert space to a single open shell @xcite .",
    "however , in nuclei near the neutron drip line , shell structure becomes less dominant , and the problem becomes more difficult .",
    "alternative approaches of using a local density approximation for the pairing fields @xcite are also being pursued .",
    "advances in quantum monte carlo methods in the new millennium have made possible essentially exact , _ ab initio _ calculations of the equations of state of low - density neutron matter .",
    "we are also developing methods to calculate the pairing gaps in low - density neutron matter , and in dilute fermi gases from the bare interactions .",
    "all realistic models of nuclear forces predict similar properties of low - density neutron matter , thus these _ ab initio _ predictions are expected to have little model dependence .",
    "ways to define effective interactions in neutron matter from the results of these _ ab initio _ calculations are being refined .",
    "they can presumably be used to study the structure of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "in addition , studies of the bound states of neutrons in external potential wells meant to represent the effects of the neutron - proton interaction may also provide new insights in the structure of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "the calculations were made possible by grants of time on the parallel computers of argonne and los alamos national laboratory and the national energy research scientific computing center .",
