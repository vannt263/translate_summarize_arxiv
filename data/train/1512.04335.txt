    "in a couple of years , there is remarkable progress in understanding non - perturbative effects in m - theory through gauge / gravity duality .",
    "most important tools in this progress are the supersymmetry localization @xcite and fermi gas approach @xcite .",
    "these are applied to partition functions in a class of low - energy effective theories of @xmath13 m2-branes on @xmath0 and it has turned out that the partition functions are described by an ideal fermi gas system :    z(n ) = _ s_n ( -1)^d^n x _ j=1^n ( x_j , x_(j ) ) , [ eq : fermi ]    where @xmath14 plays an role of the density matrix in the fermi gas system . thanks to these techniques , now we know detailed structures of the non - perturbative effects in m - theory on @xmath15 @xcite , which is dual to the 3d @xmath6 superconformal chern - simons ( cs ) theory known as the abj(m ) theory @xcite via ads / cft correspondence ( see also important earlier works @xcite ) .    on the other hand",

    "for instance , it is unclear whether many attractive features found in the abj(m ) theory such as the airy functional behavior @xcite , pole cancellation @xcite and correspondence to topological string @xcite are universal for general m2-brane theories or accidental for the abj(m ) theory .",
    "while the airy functional behavior has been found for a broad class of m2-brane theories @xcite and seems universal @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the other features have been found in few examples .",
    "this problem has been addressed in special cases of imamura - kimura type theory @xcite , whose type iib brane construction consists of ns5-branes and @xmath18 - 5 branes connected by @xmath13 d3-branes . especially the orbifold abjm theory and @xmath19 model @xcite have been studied well in @xcite .",

    "<S> we also argue that partition functions of @xmath9 quiver theories have representations in terms of an ideal fermi gas systems associated with @xmath10-type quiver theories and this leads an interesting relation between certain @xmath11 and @xmath12 supersymmetric gauge theories .    </S>",
