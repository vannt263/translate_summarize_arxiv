    "manipulation of carrier spins in ferromagnetic / semiconductor heterostructures offers enhanced functionality of spin - electronic devices such as spin transistors , sensors , and magnetic memory cells  @xcite .",
    "this manipulation can be realized on the base of magnetic nanostructures by use of magnetoresistance effects and due to interactions between magnetic nanostructures and electron spins in field - effect transistors .",
    "magnetoresistance effects are attracting much attention in a view of their various applications .",
    "an extremely large magnetoresistance ( @xmath2 % ) has been observed at room temperature in gaas / granular film heterostructures in the avalanche state , where a granular film contains ferromagnetic metal nanoparticles or ferromagnetic islands on the semiconductor / film interface .",
    "the value of this effect is two - three orders higher than the maximum values of the giant magnetoresistance in the metal magnetic multilayers and the tunnelling magnetoresistance in the magnetic tunnel junction structures .",
    "magnetoresistance effects of high values have been found in gaas / granular film heterostructures with granular films containing ferromagnetic metal mnsb nano - islands @xcite and ferromagnetic mnas clusters  @xcite .",
    "the high values of the magnetoresistance based on the avalanche breakdown has been observed on the sio@xmath0(co)/gaas heterostructures , where the sio@xmath0(co ) is the granular sio@xmath1 film containing co nanoparticles  @xcite .",
    "this effect has been called the injection magnetoresistance ( imr )",
    ". it appears , when electrons are injected from the granular film into the gaas .",
    "field - effect hemt devices with spin polarized electron channels are perspective due to the possibility to change electron spins in channels by a magnetic field action . in this paper , we study devices on the base of magnetic nanostructures with silicon dioxide films with cobalt nanoparticles sio@xmath0(co ) on gaas substrate  magnetic sensors and field - effect transistor governed by applied magnetic field .",
    "magnetic sensors are based on the imr effect .",
    "the field - effect transistor contains the sio@xmath0(co ) film under gate .",
    "the magnetic field action leads to great changes in the electron mobility in the channel due to the interaction between spins of co nanoparticles and electron spins .",
    "high values of the imr - effect in the sio@xmath0(co ) heterostructures are explained by the magnetic - field - controlled process of impact ionization in the vicinity of the spin - dependent potential barrier formed in the semiconductor ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the spin - dependent potential barrier is formed near the interface by the exchange interaction between the electrons in localized states in the electron accumulation layer in the semiconductor and @xmath3-electrons of co  @xcite .",
    "the avalanche process is induced by electrons , which ( 1 ) surmount over the spin - dependent potential barrier formed by the exchange - splitted localized states and ( 2 ) tunnel from the localized states .",
    "the impact ionization induced by the injected electrons produces holes , which move , are accumulated in the region of the potential barrier and lower the barrier height  @xcite .",
    "owing to the formed hole feedback , small variations in the barrier height lead to great changes in the current and in the avalanche process .",
    "the applied magnetic field increases the barrier height , reduces the transparency of the barrier , and suppresses the onset of the impact ionization .",
    "magnetic sensors were performed on the samples sio@xmath0(co)/gaas with the @xmath4-gaas substrates .",
    "carrier concentrations in the @xmath4-gaas are equal to @xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "the sio@xmath0(co ) films were deposited by the ion - beam co - sputtering of the composite cobalt - quartz target onto the gaas substrates heated to 200@xmath7c .",
    "the concentration of co nanoparticles in the silicon dioxide was varied by changing the ratio of target areas of cobalt and quartz areas .",
    "the film composition was determined by the nuclear physical methods of element analysis using a deuteron beam of the electrostatic accelerator ( rutherford backscattering spectrometry and nuclear reaction with oxygen ) . for the samples used in magnetic sensors ,",
    "the relative co content is in the range 45 - 71  at.% and the film thickness is 40  nm .",
    "the average size of co particles , determined from the low - angle x - ray scattering measurements , increases with co content : from 2.9  nm at 45  at.% to 3.9  nm at 71  at.% . as the co content increases , the resistivity of the sio@xmath1(co ) films decreases from 0.3  @xmath8 cm ( 45  at.% ) through 3.0@xmath9 @xmath8 cm ( 60  at.% ) to 1.4@xmath9 @xmath8 cm ( 71  at.% ) .",
    "the protective au layer of the thickness 3 - 5 nm have been sputtered on the sio@xmath0(co ) films .",
    "the sizes of the samples in magnetic sensors were equal to @xmath10  mm .",
    "one contact was on the gaas substrate , and the other  on the au layer sputtered on the granular film .",
    "magnetic sensors are characterized by the injection magnetoresistance , which is defined by the coefficient    @xmath11    where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the resistances of the sio@xmath1(co)/gaas heterostructure without a field and in the magnetic field @xmath14 , respectively ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the current densities flowing in the heterostructure in the absence of a magnetic field and in the field @xmath14 .",
    "the imr ratio for sio@xmath0(co)/gaas heterostructures with different co concentrations versus the applied voltage @xmath17 in the magnetic field @xmath14 = 2.1  koe at room temperature is shown in fig .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath14 is parallel to the film .",
    "according to @xcite , for magnetic fields of high values ( @xmath18 10  koe ) the imr coefficient increases with the growth of the applied voltage .",
    "in contrast to this , for low magnetic fields the imr reaches highest values in the region of the avalanche onset . as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , in order to reach high sensitivity of sensors it is need to apply the voltage in this region .",
    "the field - effect hemt device with a spin polarized electron channel was developed on the base of the @xmath4-gaas / algaas heterostructures ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this device contains an amorphous granular sio@xmath1(co ) film with cobalt nanoparticles under the gate electrode .",
    "the thickness of the film is equal to 40  nm .",
    "the sio@xmath0(co ) film polarizes electron spins in the accumulation layer under the gate .",
    "current - voltage curves of field - effect devices have two different parts  @xcite .",
    "if the voltage between the source and the drain @xmath19 is less than the saturation voltage @xmath20 , then the current - voltage curve is sub - linear and the current @xmath21 flowing in the channel is written as    @xmath22,\\label{eq1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 is the voltage between the gate and the source , @xmath24 is the threshold voltage between the gate and the source , when there is no current in the channel , @xmath25 is the specific capacity between the gate and the channel , @xmath26 is the electron mobility , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the channel width and the length , respectively .",
    "when @xmath29 , the channel becomes blocked at the drain contact and an electrical field of high value appears in this region . in this case , the saturation voltage is    @xmath30    for @xmath31 the drain current @xmath21 is weakly dependent on the voltage @xmath19 and the current - voltage curve can be approximated by a line with a weak slope . in the first approximation this sloping part of the current - voltage curve",
    "can be written as    @xmath32    the current - voltage dependences of the developed field - effect hemt structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) contain two parts of the current - voltage curve described by relations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "the saturation voltage @xmath20 is in the range 0.4 - 0.7  mv . as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the drain current @xmath21 of the field - effect transistor presents strong dependence on the governed external magnetic field @xmath14 .",
    "the electron mobility @xmath26 in the channel decreases with the growth of the applied magnetic field .",
    "this property can be used in magneto - sensitive devices .",
    "we study devices on the base of magnetic nanostructures containing silicon dioxide films with cobalt nanoparticles sio@xmath0(co ) on gaas substrate  magnetic sensors and field - effect transistor .",
    "magnetic sensors are based on the injection magnetoresistance effect in the avalanche onset regime .",
    "the field - effect transistor contains sio@xmath0(co ) film under gate .",
