    "between 2009 and 2013 , the _ kepler _ space telescope recorded high - precision photometry almost continuously for more than 150,000 stars near the constellation cygnus and lyra @xcite .",
    "this unprecedented data - set was used to detect more than 4000 exoplanet candidates ( of which 1031 _ kepler _ planets have been confirmed to - date ) and revolutionized our understanding of the statistical occurrence of exoplanets and stellar astrophysics .",
    "the light curves of more than 2400 eclipsing binary stars were also measured @xcite , resulting in the detection of over 70 triple systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and new astrophysical phenomena such as tidally excited heartbeat binaries @xcite , self - lensing binaries @xcite , and doppler boosting in ordinary stars @xcite .",
    "most of these discoveries were made by the _",
    "kepler _ science teams , using an automated pipeline @xcite to analyze the photometric data .",
    "in addition , the planet hunters citizen science project was established to engage the public in helping to analyze the wealth of light curves @xcite .",
    "this turned out to be a complementary scientific asset : to date , the visual inspection of light curves from planet hunters has resulted in the recovery and characterization of many of the transiting systems detected by the _",
    "kepler _ team and more than 50 unique exoplanet candidates .",
    "this includes dozens of giant planet candidates residing in the putative habitable zones of their host stars , and a circumbinary exoplanet orbiting one of a pair of binaries in a widely separated quadruple system @xcite .",
    "_ kepler _ was about to begin an extended mission when the loss of the second of four reaction wheels ended the primary mission . at this juncture , a new plan of operation",
    "was devised to point the spacecraft along the ecliptic plane .",
    "this orbit minimizes the perturbations from solar illumination and pointing is maintained with the remaining two reaction wheels @xcite .",
    "this repurposed mission , known as _ k2 _ , will survey ten new fields along the ecliptic plane over the next two to three years .",
    "each of these ecliptic pointings constitutes one campaign , and the duration of observations for each field is limited to about 75 days because of solar radiation pressure constraints .",
    "all data are immediately non - proprietary , and will be released from the mikulski archive for space telescope ( mast ) archive about three months after observations to engage the community in rapid follow - up . the first _",
    "k2 _ observations began in 2014 march to assess the quality of the photometric precision .",
    "this campaign 0 ( c0 ) data was uploaded to mast in 2014 september .",
    "c0 data set consists of observations from an @xmath0  day long engineering run , designed to assess whether a long term two - wheeled , ecliptic orientated mission was viable .",
    "significant differences exist between the _ kepler _ and the _ k2 _ data sets in both quantity and quality .",
    "while the _ kepler _ targets were carefully vetted before the launch of the mission and nominally selected based on their magnitude and luminosity class , the _ k2 _",
    "c0 targets were requested by the community and selected from 89 diverse guest observer proposals that aimed to carry out a broad range of science goals .",
    "this method of _",
    "target selection has introduced different selection biases than for the stars observed in the _ kepler _ field .",
    "target information for each campaign is stored in the ecliptic plane input catalog ] ( epic ) .",
    "unlike the _ kepler _ mission , the quality of the _ k2 _",
    "c0 photometry is compromised by quasi - periodic , six hour thruster firings , a more rapidly changing thermal environment , and the emergent failure of detector module  7 .",
    "these effects have introduced significant and non - uniform systematics into the data .",
    "targets that are farther from the bore sight sweep out larger arcs on the detectors than targets that are in the center of the field .",
    "because of complications extracting and cleaning light curves , the _ k2 _ mission is currently only providing mast with a calibrated target pixel file ( tpf ) for each target .    despite these new challenges , the precision photometry offered by the _",
    "k2 _ mission will continue to make significant contributions to the field of eclipsing binaries ( ebs ) .",
    "this has already been evidenced by the two - wheel concept engineering test  data set , a nine - day target limited observation performed in 2014 february that resulted in the detection of 31 ebs @xcite . upon release of the c0 tpfs",
    ", we developed a custom light curve extraction pipeline in order to reduce and review the data .",
    "we present results from our pilot study to identify light curves that exhibit periodic variations , in particular , eclipsing binaries in the c0 data set .",
    "these results join ebs detected from _ kepler _ and the _ k2 _ : two - wheel concept engineering test within the kepler eclipsing binary catalog ] .",
    "we initially extracted 7761 light curves in an automated fashion and independently de - correlated each of them against the spacecraft s known pointing motions , using the same technique described in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the aperture extraction mask size was adjusted as a function of the epic catalog listed source magnitude , with minimum mask dimensions of @xmath1 pixels designated for the faintest observed c0 targets ( @xmath2 of 19 or less ) ranging up to @xmath3 for the brightest ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "unfortunately , a systemic spacecraft pointing error resulted in degradation for the first 40 days of observations for all targets ( about half of the full c0 observation time baseline ) .",
    "while this early data range was not entirely compromised , we only used the second half of c0 observations in our bulk analysis .",
    "however , in our final analysis we were able to recover some of this early data to aid in characterizing several long period eclipsing binaries .",
    "visual inspection of the extracted c0 light curves produced an initial list of 258 epic targets that were flagged to be investigated for transient or periodic variations suggestive of an eb .",
    "a fast fourier transform ( fft ) routine subsequently recovered an additional 53 candidate signals of varying periods .",
    "a 384,000 pixel superstamp  was used in c0 to capture flux from the open clusters ngc  2168 ( m35 ) and ngc  2158 .",
    "the superstamp is coverage oriented , and no explicit epic target identifications are associated with each of the 153 uniform dimension tpfs contained within the superstamp .",
    "we assessed each of the superstamp tpfs for crowding . in this selection , we excluded dim background sources comprised of fewer than four pixels and any brighter source truncated by the borders of the tpf mask .",
    "we tailored our photometric extraction routine to identify source centroids and process light curves , again adjusting aperture masks as a function of source magnitude .",
    "these superstamp extracted light curves were then visually reviewed and vetted at the pixel - level in the same manner as the regular c0 target sample . although there is increased incidence of source confusion for superstamp tpfs covering the nominal center of each cluster , in many cases the exterior areas of the superstamp yielded high quality light curves at an average of 23 extractions per tpf .",
    "examination of the output from this superstamp pipeline resulted in 49 additional periodic variables which were added to our initial investigation pool , bringing the total number of flagged targets to 360  .    because of concern about the quality of the _ k2 _",
    "c0 data , we employed open source guest observer software pyke @xcite ] to perform a second series of extractions for the flagged point sources , reducing the data into two new light curves using two different reduction techniques ; self field flattening ( sff ) @xcite and principal component analysis ( pca ) .",
    "these two reduction routines are included in the pyke software package as kepsff and keppca and have been updated for use with _",
    "the sff method corrects for the _ k2 _ aperture photometry artifacts by isolating short term variability and calculating a position - flux relation for each detrended iteration of the extracted light curve .",
    "pca accomplishes a similar isolation of systematics by assessing the time series variability of each individual pixel in the chosen extraction mask and then segregating these trends into component groups that are correlated or anti - correlated to instrument movement @xcite .",
    "aperture photometry pixel masks common to this second series of reductions and pixel level analysis were manually defined on a case by case basis in order to minimize flux losses from the intended target and to exclude neighboring sources wherever possible",
    ". we also extracted and inspected light curves from bright neighboring sources that were potentially contaminating our target of interest .",
    "the light curves extracted with keppca and kepssf were compared to assess the degree each routine had muted or obfuscated the intrinsic astrophysical signal . testing this across a variety of point",
    "sources showed that neither reduction technique offers a clear advantage over the other in all situations .",
    "as such , we chose to employ light curves derived from both kepsff and keppca for each of the targets reviewed in the course of our dedicated pixel - level analysis .",
    "due to _ kepler _ s sensitivity , pixel size , and observing fields , the likeliness for source confusion common to any given target is high .",
    "the most common forms of contamination occur as a result of _ kepler _ s pixel response function ( prf ) , which is quantified by the spacecraft s pointing precision , pixel resolution and point spread function @xcite . when the prf of two or more point sources directly overlap and blend , or when the prf wings of sufficiently bright stars encroach into the photometric apertures of separated targets , the variable signal from one point source can be introduced into another point source as a diluted alias @xcite . for this reason",
    "we take a conservative approach in the vetting of ebs for our final c0 sample .",
    "if the source of the eclipsing signal for a particular eb could not confidently be determined during a pixel level review , it was excluded from our final sample .",
    "of the 360 light curves we flagged for eclipsing or ellipsoidal activity , 153 were ultimately rejected as spurious detections or blended binaries that could not be confidently associated with a a specific point source .",
    "the itemized breakdown of these rejected eb candidates is detailed as follows :    \\1 .",
    "fifteen flagged epic targets were rejected as suspected cases of direct prf contamination .",
    "examination of the tpf in conjunction with review of optical all - sky databases ( e.g. , 2mass , @xcite ; dss ; wise , @xcite ) indicated that multiple point sources were blended or crowded within our initially employed photometric aperture .",
    "subsequent efforts to re - extract and isolate the eclipse signal failed to tease apart the originating pixel location and as such these low signal - to - noise ( snr ) candidates were culled from our sample .",
    "twenty - nine additional cases where a point source in the halo of an epic s tpf was found to contaminate the intended epic target s light curve .",
    "aliases were identified where it was evident that the halo source displayed the same ephemerides but at a much greater amplitude .",
    "we have cross matched the 2mass identifications of these non - epic ebs and appropriately noted the victimized epics as false positives in the kepler eclipsing binary catalog . in eight cases where the suspected source of contamination was truncated by the edge of the tpf definition or itself appeared to be a blend ,",
    "the target was removed from our final sample .",
    "nine targets were culled after an investigation for periods and epochs that matched or were closely similar to another eb candidate in our sample .",
    "ephemerides matching has previously proven an effective tool to root out false positives _",
    "kepler _ data ( e.g. , @xcite ) . with the small size of our vetting sample it was possible to perform this search manually with large allowances for period error .",
    "no maximum arc second search radius was imposed in order to safeguard against potential instrument related forms of contamination that allow variable signals to afflict victim sources positioned on entirely different area of the detector , such as ccd crosstalk and antipodal reflection @xcite .",
    "although no clear cases of such exotic contamination were clearly identified , we identified nine cases of epics that were contaminating other observed epics .",
    "fourteen pairs of epics were noted during ephemerides matching and other vetting processes as apparent duplicate observations : the tpfs for each epic center on the same apparent point source , but with minutely differing target catalog coordinates listed . after reviewing the data to ensure that a dim field companion star was not actually the source of either epic proposal , we retained the epic that appeared best centered on the intended target and removed the other seven epics from our sample .",
    "twenty - eight targets were rejected as cases of mistaken identity with variable stars displaying periodic or near - periodic pulsations or rotational modulation .",
    "sixty - five flagged epics were rejected without conclusive final dispositions and are suspected to be largely spurious detections from two general categories : faint background ebs unresolved in the tpf pixel data and available all - sky data or artifact escapements common to our reduction processes .",
    "the 207 survivors of these culling reviews were selected for further characterization and calculation of ephemerides .",
    "a serendipitous by - product of these analyses were the identification of two exoplanet candidates .",
    "the periodicity for each target displaying three or more eclipses was initially determined based on the phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ) method @xcite . the pdm variant method described by @xcite",
    "was also used to find periods .",
    "the pdm methods essentially fold the light curve at different periods and assign a dispersion score   for each detected period . these scores",
    "are then sorted , the minima associated with the best scores are picked and iteratively phase folded at increasingly narrower period ranges to find the best local solution .",
    "our routine based on the original @xcite work proved effective at correctly identifying the estimated period with no constraints on initial period range .",
    "however , we also utilized the pdm variant by @xcite as it assigns scores differently : a boxcar average is subtracted from the flux for each test fold and the residuals are squared and summed in order to provide ranking .",
    "we evaluated mid - eclipse times by employing the methods of kwm   @xcite , barycenter ( e.g. , @xcite ) and least squares ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the output parameters were then vetted by eye to ensure that bjd0 coincides with the deeper eclipse in cases where secondary eclipses are also present in the light curve .",
    "we use these ephemerides to plot the eb phase curves , presented in figures  [ fig : phasedplots_1 ] through [ fig : phasedplots_12 ] .",
    "the phase of each system is arranged for illustrative purposes such that the secondary eclipse , if present , is visible .",
    "the phase folded light curves were then used to determine a system morphology .",
    "morphology values range between 0 ( detached ) and 1 ( over - contact ) .",
    "morphologies are determined by first fitting a chain of four quadratic functions to the shape of the phased light curve and then determining the morphology through application of a local linear embedding @xcite routine . with",
    "the exception of heartbeat binaries and ebs lacking three observed eclipses , morphologies are computed for the entire c0 sample .",
    "all targets observed eclipsing in the c0 data set were crossed matched against all - sky catalog listings in the international variable star index ( vsx ) @xcite and the simbad database @xcite within a 20 arc second search radius using ra and dec coordinates from mast .",
    "results for 2mass source identifications were found to be in good agreement with the k2-tess stellar properties catalog @xcite , which includes epic to 2mass cross matches accurate to within one arc second .",
    "for m35 superstamp related targets , we also performed a cross check against recently published ground survey data from the asiago pathfinder for harps - n ( aphn ) program , which has performed a long term , high - precision ( 5 milli - mag ) search of open clusters m35 and ngc 2158 for variable stars @xcite .",
    "these cross matches allowed us to determine known stellar companions to our targets as well as alternate source identifications . we also checked and reviewed our results against the target proposal lists of the c0 guest observer ( go ) proposals in order to determine which targets were known binary or multiple star systems .",
    "our search of the go proposals revealed that 110  of the 207  eclipsing targets we identified and retained in our final sample had been requested for _",
    "k2 _ c0 observation by several different go programs as known or suspected binaries .",
    "an additional balance of 158 epics ( approximately 60% ) proposed by these binary star related gos were not found to eclipse or possess ellipsoidal variations that could be attributed to a binary as per our culling criteria ( section  [ sec : culling ] ) .",
    "however a considerable portion of this balance may represent non - eclipsing objects ( e.g. , spectroscopic binaries , elv binaries , cataclysmic variables , etc . ) and thus the balance of non - detections in our _ k2 _ c0 photometry is not unexpected .",
    "our analysis resulted in 97  new ebs detected in the c0 field .",
    "the orbital periods , ephemerides , morphologies , and cross matched identifications for all ebs in our sample are organized and presented in five tables .",
    "the 110  previously identified or suspected ebs in c0 are cataloged in table  [ tab : knownebs ] .",
    "the 97  new eb detections are presented in table  [ tab : newebs ] ( epic targets ) , table  [ tab : m35eb ] ( m35 superstamp targets ) , and table  [ tab : nonepic ] ( non - epic targets ) .",
    "the non - epic associated ebs were detected via their contamination of go proposed target masks , creating a false positive eb signal . due to the large size of c0 tpf stamps",
    ", we were able to extract and analyze light curves from these listed contaminators ( see section [ sec : culling ] ) .",
    "a separate collection of false positive cases caused by direct pixel response function ( prf ) contamination @xcite between pairs of observed epic targets are listed in table  [ tab : blends ] .",
    "the sky plotted distribution for all 207  ebs in our final sample is presented in figure  [ fig : c0_newebs1 ] .",
    "we observed nine selected objects identified as interesting in our analysis ( for details refer to sections  [ sec : noteworthy_ebs ] and [ sec : planet_candidates ] ) on the nights of december 15 , 19 , and 20 , 2014 using the observatoire astronomique du mont - mgantic s ( omm ) 1.6-m telescope and long - slit spectrometer .",
    "the spectrometer employed a 1200-line / mm grating which yielded a dispersion of 0.89   / pixel and a wavelength range of @xmath5    ( 3750  5600 ) .",
    "depending on the brightness of each object , up to three exposures were co - added to improve the signal to noise ; the total integration time for each object ranged between 20 to 90 minutes .",
    "all of the spectra were background subtracted , corrected for the quantum efficiency of the ccd detector and the reflectance of the grating , and corrected for rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere before being co - added .",
    "we classified the spectrum for each source by comparison to the gray digital spectral classification atlas @xcite .",
    "we adopt a conservative uncertainty in the spectral classifications of 2 sub - classes . after a match in spectral type and luminosity class",
    "was found , we used the reference table in @xcite to estimate the fundamental stellar properties for each classification .",
    "the spectra are presented in figure  [ fig : ebspectra1 ] ( ebs ) and figure  [ fig : pcplots_1 ] ( planet candidates ) .",
    "the spectrum for each target is discussed where appropriate in the sections to follow .",
    "nine stars for which we obtained spectroscopic @xmath6 estimate overlap in the k2-tess portal .",
    "eight of these nine stars have @xmath6 estimates in the k2-tess database @xcite . in all cases",
    "the photometric k2-tess @xmath6 determination is significantly cooler than the spectroscopic based estimate of @xmath6 .",
    "two of these stars are also present in the photometric catalog of all tycho stars @xcite , also having similar @xmath6 estimates as the k2-tess estimates , though the @xcite errors are typically on the order of several thousands of degrees ( e.g. , epic 202073097 has a @xmath7  k ) .",
    "we suspect that the reason for this disagreement is that reddening is not accounted for in the k2-tess catalog .",
    "since the c0 field points to the galactic anti - center ( @xmath8 ) and thus much through the galactic plane , reddening makes considerable differences in the target colors which are used in the color - temperature relations by the k2-tess catalog s are now available in the k2-tess portal .",
    "these results generally perform better , though several hundreds of k differences from the spectroscopic values still remain in some cases . ] . as such ,",
    "any of the temperatures listed in this paper ( not estimated from our spectra ) should be used with caution .",
    "it is also worth noting that neither method makes correction for binarity , however this task is not trivial with the small amount of data at hand .    in any case , for this set of nine of spectroscopically observed stars , it appears that the k2-tess dwarf / giant estimator method is reliable .",
    "two stars that were observed spectroscopically were classified as likely giants ( luminosity class iii ) , and both of these were identified as giants also in the k2-tess database on the basis of the reduced proper motion ( see @xcite ) .",
    "with a time baseline of about 80 days , the k2 light curves can be used to identify ebs with periods out to @xmath9 days . while k2 has greater detection capabilities than ground - based photometry , due to greater photometric precision and duty cycle , there is value in combining these results with those from ground - based photometric surveys and transit searches .",
    "projects including superwasp @xcite , hatnet @xcite , xo @xcite , and kelt @xcite have accumulated observations over many years , and provide greater time baselines than k2 .",
    "the addition of longer time baselines to the k2 light curves makes it possible to search for eclipse timing variations or amplitude variations of the ebs .    to explore the potential of that approach ,",
    "we have cross - matched the k2 ebs in tables  [ tab : knownebs ] and [ tab : newebs ] with data from the kelt survey .",
    "kelt is a wide - field , small - aperture photometric survey , with a 23 degree x 23 degree field of view , and a nonstandard broad @xmath10 filter .",
    "two of the currently reduced fields from kelt overlap with k2 c0 north of dec  @xmath11 .",
    "the kelt light curves were reduced and extracted according to the procedures described in @xcite , and include about 7700 to 8600 observations from oct 2006 to march 2013 .",
    "additional observations after that time have been gathered but not yet reduced .",
    "typical photometric precisions are 0.5% rms around @xmath12 magnitude , and 2% rms around @xmath13 magnitude . north of @xmath14 degrees , kelt has light curves for all k2 c0 targets brighter than @xmath15 magnitude , and has light curves for at least 50% of the k2 c0 targets in the range @xmath16 .",
    "the long time baseline and good photometric precision of the kelt light curves allow us to measure the properties of many of the eclipsing binaries found in k2 .",
    "a full analysis is ongoing , but we show an example of combining the kelt and k2 data in figure  [ fig : kelt_k2_full ] .",
    "table  [ tab : kelt_phot ] displays the overlap of targets with k2 c0 and the currently available kelt data in hand .",
    "potential applications include searching for eclipse depth , duration , and timing variations indicative of outer companions , or placing upper limits on such variations .",
    "noteworthy ebs within our final sample include ten detached eclipsing binaries with periods longer than 20 days ( epics : 202064253 , 202071945 , 202072282 , 202084588 , 202086225 , 202090938 , 202091197 , 202091404 , 202092842 , 202071645 ) and six candidates possessing single eclipses of significant depth but for which no period is yet determined ( epics : 202060921 , 202071902 , 202072917 , 202085278 , 202135247 , 202137580 ) .",

    "for the 97  newly identified ebs , we provide periods , ephemerides , and cross - matched catalog identifications . due to the shorter baseline of c0 compared to the _ kepler _",

    "we further recognize that the decorrelation methods utilized in our survey have played a major role in our recovery ratios and overall completeness . while kepsff and keppca provide an excellent foundation from which to reduce",
    "data , intrinsic astrophysical signals can be obfuscated or removed by such solutions and care must be taken in their application .",
    "alternative approaches to mitigating the effect of spacecraft pointing jitter are being explored , such as those described by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "k2 _ baseline ) whose signals might conceivably manifest themselves as transient dimming events during ecliptic - orientated tess observations . while _ k2 _",
    "observations alone can not fully characterize such long period events , their initial identification will allow potential spectroscopic or photometric follow - up from ground based or in - orbit facilities .",
    "in addition , any m or k dwarfs local to earth ( e.g. within 20 parsecs ) that can be shown to be binaries or blended binaries via _",
    "k2 _ photometry ( or subsequent ground based follow - up ) constitute a limited yet important early sample from a population of high priority targets for the upcoming jwst mission . owing to their reduced stellar radii ,",
    "transits and eclipses occurring in such systems can yield significantly higher final average snr values and in some cases allow limited transmission spectroscopy .",
    "however , by consequence , the deeper transits noted for such stellar types must be carefully vetted against the host of false positive possibilities . the jwst continuous viewing zone will have some degree of overlap with _ k2 _",
    "ecliptic fields , but the instrument will also possess a finite supply of thruster fuel .",
