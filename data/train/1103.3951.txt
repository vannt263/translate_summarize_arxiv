    "note , that the first attempt to obtain the anomalous three - boson interaction in the framework of bogoliubov approach was done in work  @xcite .",
    "our interaction constant @xmath23 is connected with conventional definitions in the following way @xmath24 the current limitations for parameter @xmath25 read  @xcite @xmath26 due to our approximation @xmath27 we use the same @xmath28 for both charged @xmath29 and neutral @xmath30 bosons and assume no difference in anomalous interaction for @xmath31 and @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33 .",
    "let us consider expression   ( [ l0 ] ) as the new * free * lagrangian @xmath34 , whereas expression  ( [ lint ] ) as the new * interaction * lagrangian @xmath35 .",
    "it is important to note , that we put into the new * free * lagrangian the full quadratic in @xmath21 term including boson self - interaction , because we prefer to maintain gauge invariance of the approximation being used . indeed , we shall use both quartic term from the last term in  ( [ l0 ] ) and triple one from the last but one term of  ( [ l0 ] ) .",
    "then compensation conditions ( see for details  @xcite ) will consist in demand of full connected three - gluon vertices of the structure  ( [ vertex ] ) , following from lagrangian @xmath34 , to be zero .",
    "this demand gives a non - linear equation for form - factor @xmath36 .",
    "such equations according to terminology of works  @xcite are called * compensation equations*. in a study of these equations it is always evident the existence of a perturbative trivial solution ( in our case @xmath37 ) , but , in general , a non - perturbative non - trivial solution may also exist .",
    "just the quest of a non - trivial solution inspires the main interest in such problems .",
    "let us remind , that non - trivial solutions give proper explanations for super - fluidity and superconductivity effects ( see again  @xcite ) .",

    "is presented in fig . 1 . here",

    "the necessary rules are presented in paper  @xcite .",
    "at first let us present the expression for four - boson vertex    @xmath39    here triad @xmath40 _ etc _ means correspondingly incoming momentum , isotopic index , lorentz index of a boson .",
    "let us formulate compensation equations in this approximation .",
    "for * free * lagrangian @xmath34 full connected three - gluon vertices with lorentz structure  ( [ vertex ] ) are to vanish .",
    "one can succeed in obtaining analytic solutions for the following set of momentum variables ( see fig .",
    "1 ) : left - hand legs have momenta @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and a right - hand leg has zero momenta . however in our approximation",
    "we need form - factor @xmath36 also for non - zero values of this momentum .",
    "we look for a solution with the following simple dependence on all three variables @xmath43 really , expression  ( [ 123 ] ) is symmetric and it turns to @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "we consider the representation  ( [ 123 ] ) to be the first approximation and we plan to take into account the corresponding correction in forthcoming studies .",
    "we shall look for non - trivial solutions of compensation equations .",
    "such solutions are also evidently non - perturbative .",
    "we would emphasize , that the existence of a non - trivial solution could be achived only provided some strict relations between parameters of the problem being fulfilled .    now according to the rules being stated above we obtain the following equation for form - factor @xmath44    @xmath46    here @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is an integration momentum , @xmath50 .",
    "the last four terms in brackets represent diagrams with one usual gauge vertex ( see three last diagrams at fig .",

    "let us remind that the adequate description of low - momenta region in qcd can be achieved by an introduction of the effective nambu  jona - lasinio interaction  @xcite ( see recent review  @xcite ) .",
    "the spontaneous generation of njl - type interaction was demonstrated in works  @xcite . in these works",
    "pions are described as bound states of light quarks , which are formed due to the effective njl interaction with account of qcd corrections . in the present work",
    "we explore the analogous considerations and assume that scalar fields which substitute elementary higgs fields are formed by bound states of heavy quarks @xmath84 .",
    "as usually we introduce left doublet @xmath85 and right singlet @xmath86 .",
    "then we study a possibility of spontaneous generation  @xcite of the following effective non - local four - fermion interaction @xmath87 where @xmath88 are color indices .",
    "we shall formulate and solve compensation equations for form - factors of the first two interaction , while consideration of the two last ones is postponed for the next approximations . here",
    "we follow the procedure used in works  @xcite , which deal with four - fermion nambu ",
    "jona - lasinio interaction .",
    "however coupling constants @xmath89 essentially influence the forthcoming results .    following our method ( see details in  @xcite ) we come to the following compensation equations for form - factors @xmath90 and @xmath91 , corresponding respectively to the first two terms in  ( [ ff ] ) . in diagram form",
    "the equation is shown at fig .",
    "@xmath92    here @xmath93 , @xmath94 is the upper limit of integration analogous to that used in the previous section and @xmath95 is an auxiliary cut - off , which is introduced for loop diagrams of fig .",
    "2 without form - factors .",
    "it is important to stress that @xmath95 disappears from all final expressions provided all conditions for solutions being fulfilled .    introducing substitution @xmath96 and comparing the two equations  ( [ phif ] ) we get convinced , that both equations become being the same under the following condition @xmath97 with definitions @xmath98 we are rested with one equation    @xmath99\\,;\\quad \\bar z_0\\,=\\,\\frac{(\\omega^2 + 8 \\omega)\\bar g^2 \\bar y^2}{2^{14}\\,\\pi^4}\\,.\\label{eqz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here we omit all terms containing auxiliary cut - off @xmath100 due to their cancellation .",
    "performing consecutive differentiations of eq.([eqz ] ) we obtain the following differential equation for @xmath101 @xmath102 equation  ( [ diffeq ] ) is equivalent to integral equation  ( [ eqz ] ) provided the following boundary conditions being fulfilled @xmath103 note that just boundary conditions  ( [ bc1 ] ) lead to cancellation of all terms containing @xmath95 .",
    "differential equation  ( [ diffeq ] ) is a meijer equation  @xcite and the solution of the problem  ( [ diffeq ] , [ bc1 ] ) is the following @xmath104 here we also take into account condition @xmath105 that gives @xmath106 we would draw attention to the fact , that unique solution  ( [ sol22 ] ) exists only for infinite upper limit in integrals .",
    "let us study a possibility of spin - zero doublet bound state @xmath108 , which can be referred to a higgs scalar doublet .",
    "with account of interaction  ( [ ff ] ) using results of the previous section we have the following bethe  salpeter equation , in which we take into account the @xmath109-quark mass ( see fig .",
    "3 without the two last diagrams ) @xmath110 where the modified integral operator @xmath111 is defined in the same way as operator  ( [ kernel ] ) with @xmath112 and lower limit of integration @xmath113 being changed for @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the @xmath109-quark mass ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "then we have again differential equation @xmath116 where the main difference is the other sign of the last term , while variable @xmath117 is just the same as in  ( [ diffeq ] ) with account of relation  ( [ omega ] ) .",
    "boundary conditions now are the following @xmath118 solution of the problem is presented in the following form    @xmath119    where @xmath120 for given @xmath121 are uniquely defined by conditions  ( [ bcbs ] ) .",
    "we define interaction of the doublet @xmath122 with heavy quarks @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the coupling constant of the new interaction to be defined by normalization condition of the solution of equation  ( [ bs ] ) .",
    "then we take into account the contribution of interaction of quarks with gluons and the exchange of @xmath122 as well ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . using standard perturbative method we obtain for mass of the bound state under consideration the following expression in the same way as in  @xcite .",
    "@xmath125 here @xmath126 is the strong coupling with standard evolution , normalized at the @xmath109-quark mass .",
    "provided term with brackets inside @xmath127 being positive , bound state @xmath122 is a tachyon .",
    "let us recall the well - known relation for @xmath109-quark mass , which is defined by non - zero vacuum average @xmath128 of @xmath129 .",
    "it reads @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the value of the electro - weak scalar condensate .",
    "however in our approach there are additional contribution to this mass , e.g. due to diagram shown at fig .",
    "4 . for the moment we can not calculate contributions of such diagrams , so we take for experimental value of the @xmath109-quark mass the modified definition @xmath132 where we take into account additional contributions in terms of factor @xmath133 .",
    "this means that @xmath115 will be also the input parameter .",
    "let us consider the case when relation  ( [ mphi ] ) leads to a tachyon state .",
    "for higgs mechanism to be realized we need also four - fold interaction @xmath134 coupling constant in  ( [ 4phi ] ) is defined in terms of the following loop integral @xmath135 from well - known relations @xmath136 and the higgs mass squared @xmath137 we have @xmath138 from  ( [ tour ] ) and  ( [ eta2 ] ) we have useful relation @xmath139 we define @xmath124 from a normalization condition , which we formulate in the next section .",
    "let us consider an interaction of @xmath21-bosons and the higgs particle .",
    "we start with the ready phenomenology according to which the @xmath140 interaction corresponds to the following vertex @xmath141 from this moment we assume that @xmath28 is known .",
    "additional contribution to vertex  ( [ wwh0 ] ) is provided by our effective interaction due to diagram presented at fig .",
    "5 . substituting into this diagram the first approximation @xmath142  ( [ solution ] , [ z0c ] , [ norm ] ) for the three - boson form - factor we obtain term with lorentz structure @xmath143 and thus we are to look for the following additional gauge invariant contribution to @xmath140 vertex @xmath144 where @xmath145 is a form - factor , which we find by solving an equation corresponding to diagrams at fig . 6 and @xmath146 is a constant to be defined from the solution of this equation .",
    "following the same approximation as in section 2 we also take into account terms being proportional to gauge coupling @xmath54 and obtain the following equation ( the upper limit of the momentum integration is the same @xmath51 as in eq.([eqf ] ) )    @xmath147    we would draw attention to important parameter @xmath148 , which defines a ratio of coupling constant squared of interaction  ( [ wwh1 ] ) and the main three boson coupling  ( [ fff ] ) .",
    "we shall see that equation  ( [ eqh ] ) has solutions only for some definite values of this parameter and so we have a set of eigenvalues of @xmath148 .",
    "the inhomogeneous part of eq.([eqh ] ) reads    @xmath149    using already obtained form - factor @xmath150  ( [ solutiong ] ) and values of parameters @xmath151  ( [ gy ] ) we solve equation  ( [ eqh ] ) numerically .",
    "let us define parameter @xmath100 in the following way @xmath152 vertex  ( [ wwh1 ] ) enters also to normalization condition defining coupling @xmath124 according to diagrams shown at fig .",
    "7 , where symbol of diagram denotes its coefficient afore @xmath153 in an expansion in @xmath154 with @xmath41 being a momentum of the field @xmath122 .",
    "it reads @xmath155 there are several solutions of equation  ( [ eqh ] ) with different eigenvalues of @xmath148 giving the following values of parameters : @xmath156 small values of @xmath157 lead to too large values of @xmath124 and thus to positive values of @xmath158 .",
    "this means an absence of higgs mechanism .",
    "too large values of @xmath157 lead to imaginary @xmath124 .",
    "our analysis shows , that only two intermediate solutions  ( [ xi3 ] , [ xi4 ] ) are physically admissible .",
    "note , that values of parameter @xmath100 for these solutions satisfy limitations  ( [ lambda1 ] ) .",
    "other interesting parameters depend on value @xmath159 of strong coupling at the @xmath109-quark mass .",
    "we have preferable value of this quantity , which is obtained from value @xmath160 . using standard evolution of @xmath159",
    "we obtain @xmath161 however we perform calculations also for nearby values of @xmath159 in the interval from 0.08 up to 0.12 . in doing this",
    "we proceed in the following way : for six parameters @xmath162 we have five relations  ( [ al1 ] , [ mphi],[tour ] , [ eta2 ] , [ normgh ] ) and the well - known expression @xmath163 where @xmath164 is weak interaction constant @xmath54 at @xmath21 mass .",
    "we obtain it by usual rg evolution expression  ( [ al1 ] ) from value @xmath54 at @xmath51  ( [ gy ] ) .",
    "let us remind that we consider @xmath28 as an input .",
    "all the parameters entering the expressions excepting @xmath133 are already defined above . at the present stage of the study we can not calculate @xmath133 , because e.g. for diagrams at fig .",
    "4 one needs knowledge of behavior of form - factor @xmath165 in dependence of all three variables .",
    "this problem is not solved yet , therefore we define value @xmath133 by fixing the @xmath109-quark mass in relation  ( [ tour ] ) .",
    "we have found , that for any solution of our set of equation @xmath166 is reproduced via relation  ( [ mw ] ) for any value of @xmath133 in  ( [ tour ] ) .",
    "thus for the moment we have two input parameters , which are safely known from the experiment @xmath167    now we present thus obtained parameters in table 1 for the two solutions  ( [ xi3 ] , [ xi4 ] ) being mentioned above .",
    "we see from the table that important parameters @xmath128 and @xmath164 are obtained in close agreement to experimental data . for solution  ( [ xi3 ] )",
    "@xmath128 and @xmath164 both differ from the experimental numbers not more than by @xmath168 and for solution  ( [ xi4 ] ) not more than by @xmath169 .",
    "we present at the table values of parameters in dependence on value of strong coupling at the @xmath109-quark mass .",
    "we see that this dependence is practically insignificant for all parameters but four - fermion coupling @xmath170 . for final result we would choose central experimental value @xmath171 .",
    "so we take as an estimate of our precision for higgs boson mass just the precision of definition of @xmath128 and @xmath164 and thus we obtain two possible values for the higgs boson mass : @xmath172 this prediction is the main result of the work .",
    "note that the method to calculate masses  ( [ mh1 ] , [ mh2 ] ) in our approach was previously checked while calculating @xmath173-meson mass due to njl - type interaction  @xcite .",
    "with pion decay constant @xmath174 being fixed we have  @xcite @xmath175 , that differs from real charged pion mass just by few per cent .",
    "with knowledge of parameter @xmath100  ( [ xi3 ] , [ xi4 ] ) we have thorough information for definition of form - factor of the anomalous three - boson interaction  ( [ solutiong ] ) @xmath176 the behavior of @xmath177 for solution  ( [ xi4 ] ) is presented at fig . 8 .",
    "new interaction of higgs field @xmath178 with @xmath21-s @xmath179 leads to changes in usual branching ratios for @xmath178 decays .",
    "we use here the well - known expression for @xmath30 mixed state with physical value for @xmath180 .",
    "there are unusually significant channels @xmath181 and @xmath182",
    ". therefore there may be additional restrictions from existing experiments .",
    "data from tevatron on search for higgs particle in @xmath183 channel  @xcite exclude higgs particle with interaction  ( [ inthww1 ] ) for @xmath184 .",
    "our predictions  ( [ mh1 ] , [ mh2 ] ) evidently do not contradict to this result .",
    "the recent cms results from lhc  @xcite also do not impose restrictions for bosons with masses  ( [ mh1 ] , [ mh2 ] ) .",
    "let us remind that we have obtained all the necessary parameters for estimation of widths and branching ratios for the two variants  ( [ mh1 ] , [ mh2 ] ) .",
    "the results are presented at table 2 , where we have taken central values of masses  ( [ mh1 ] , [ mh2 ] ) .",
    "we also estimate cross - sections of the higgs boson production at lhc with @xmath185 .",
    "@xmath186 note that rather unexpected prediction : larger cross - section for larger higgs mass , is easily understood by comparison of values of parameters @xmath100 and @xmath146 for these solutions ( [ xi3 ] , [ xi4 ] ) .",
    "for example with mass @xmath187 under conditions of work  @xcite we would have 10 events in interval @xmath188 for @xmath189 provided efficiency of registration being 100% . to compare with plot in",
    "@xcite we have with mass of the higgs boson indicated in brackets @xmath190 that is significantly lower , than upper limit curve in  @xcite .",
    "however with increasing of integral luminosity by an order of magnitude a quest for higgs of the discussed type would become promising , especially for decay channel @xmath191 .",
    "e.g. with integral luminosity @xmath192 and higgs mass @xmath187 we would have around 170 decays @xmath191 .    for calculations of this section comphep package  @xcite",
    "to conclude we would emphasize , that albeit we discuss quite unusual effects , we do not deal with something beyond the standard model .",
    "we are just in the framework of the standard model .",
    "what makes difference with usual results is * non - perturbative non - trivial solution * of compensation equation .",
    "there is of course also * trivial perturbative solution*. which of the solutions is realized is to be defined by stability conditions .",
    "the problem of stability is extremely complicated and needs a special extensive study .",
    "that is why we present in the work two possible solutions  ( [ mh1 ] , [ mh2 ] ) in view of anticipation of the forthcoming lhc results .",
    "confirmation of prediction  ( [ mh1 ] , [ mh2 ] ) ( see also tables 1 , 2 ) would mean proof of the non - perturbative nature of the real higgs mechanism .    with the present results we would draw attention to two important achievements provided by the non - trivial non - perturbative solution .",
    "the first one is unique determination of gauge electro - weak coupling constant @xmath193 in close agreement with experimental value .",
    "the second result consists in calculation of the fundamental quantity @xmath128  vacuum average of the scalar higgs field . at this point",
    "we would emphasize , that the existence of a non - trivial solution itself always leads to additional conditions for parameters of a problem under study .",
    "these two achievements strengthen the confidence in the correctness of applicability of bogoliubov compensation approach to the principal problems of elementary particles theory .",
    "we consider a check of prediction for higgs boson mass  ( [ mh1 ] , [ mh2 ] ) and of its properties being shown at table 2 as a decisive test of validity of the compensation approach .",

    "<S> we apply bogoliubov compensation principle to the gauge electro - weak interaction to demonstrate a spontaneous generation of anomalous three - boson gauge invariant effective interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the non - trivial solution of compensation equations uniquely defines the form - factor of the anomalous interaction and parameters of the theory including value of gauge electro - weak coupling @xmath0 in satisfactory agreement to the experimental value . </S>",
    "<S> a possibility of spontaneous generation of effective four - fermion interaction of heavy quarks is also demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction defines an equation for a scalar bound state of heavy quarks which serve as a substitute for the elementary scalar higgs doublet . as a result </S>",
    "<S> we obtain two possible solutions for the observable higgs boson mass : @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> values for other parameters e.g. anomalous three - boson coupling @xmath3 , higgs boson width @xmath4 , its branching ratios and estimates for cross - section of higgs production at lhc are also obtained .    in previous works  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite n.n . </S>",
    "<S> bogoliubov compensation principle  @xcite was applied to studies of spontaneous generation of effective non - local interactions in renormalizable gauge theories . </S>",
    "<S> spontaneous generation of nambu  jona - lasinio like interaction was studied in works  @xcite and the description of low - energy hadron physics in terms of initial qcd parameters turns to be quite successful including values of parameters : @xmath5 .    in work  @xcite the approach was applied to the electro - weak interaction and a possibility of spontaneous generation of anomalous three - boson interaction of the form @xmath6 was studied . in the present work </S>",
    "<S> we continue investigation of the electro - weak theory using other approximation scheme , which will be formulated in what follows .    </S>",
    "<S> the main principle of the approach is to check if an effective interaction could be generated in a chosen variant of a renormalizable theory . in view of this one </S>",
    "<S> performs `` add and subtract '' procedure for the effective interaction with a form - factor . </S>",
    "<S> then one assumes the presence of the effective interaction in the interaction lagrangian and the same term with the opposite sign is assigned to the newly defined free lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> this transformation of the initial lagrangian is evidently identical . </S>",
    "<S> however such free lagrangian contains completely improper term , corresponding to the effective interaction of the opposite sign . </S>",
    "<S> then one has to formulate a compensation equation , which guarantees that this new free lagrangian is a genuine free one , that is effects of the uncommon term sum up to zero . provided a non - trivial solution of this equation exists , one can state the generation of the effective interaction to be possible . </S>",
    "<S> now we apply this procedure to our problem .    in the present work </S>",
    "<S> we start with studying of possibility of generation of interaction  ( [ fff ] ) . </S>"
