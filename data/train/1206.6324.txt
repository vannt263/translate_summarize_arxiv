    "@xcite . ) to calibrate the reaction mechanism on the nucleon level , we studied the productions from nucleons @xcite .",
    "the calculations are motivated by the fact that the neutrinoproductions of @xmath6 and photons from nuclei ( and nucleons ) are potential backgrounds in neutrino - oscillation experiments ( e.g. , miniboone @xcite ) .",
    "currently , it is still a question whether the neutral current ( nc ) photon production might explain the excess events seen at low _ reconstructed _ neutrino energies , which the microboone experiment plans to answer @xcite .",
    "moreover , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite point out the possible role of anomalous interaction vertices involving @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and the photon in nc photon production .",
    "so it is necessary to calculate the cross sections for these processes . here by using the qhd eft , we study incoherent production ,",
    "in which the nucleus is excited .",
    "coherent production with the nucleus being intact is a topic of future work .",
    "we will discuss the power - counting .",
    "see refs.@xcite for detailed discussions about power - counting in qhd eft .",
    "] of the calculations through which we will show that the contributions of the anomalous interactions are small in the incoherent nc production of photons ( where they contribute at next - to - next - to - leading - order ) . to benchmark the approximation scheme , we study electron scattering in both quasi - elastic and pion production channels .",
    "there have been several experiments measuring the weak response of nuclei across the quasi - elastic region to the @xmath1 excitation peak . in most experiments @xcite , which have @xmath9 and @xmath10 as the primary target nuclei ,",
    "the mean energy of the beam is around @xmath11 .",
    "as emphasized in @xcite , we expect our theory to work up to @xmath12 gev , so we do not rely on these experiments to constrain the theory at this stage . on the theoretical side ,",
    "much work has been done ( e.g. , in @xcite ) .",
    "most of these papers are based on the global or local fermi gas approximation and include contributions from one - body currents , with improved treatment for final - state interaction ( fsi ) and @xmath1 dynamics in the medium .",
    "the same approach has also been applied in electron scattering ( e.g. , in @xcite ) . in @xcite , scaling approaches are used to address quasi - elastic scattering . moreover ,",
    "the contribution from two - body currents was studied nonrelativistically , for example , in @xcite . in most of these calculations ,",
    "the @xmath1 dynamics in nuclei is based on the work of @xcite , in which the @xmath1 self - energy has been studied using a nonrelativistic model .",
    "parallel to the nonrelativistic studies , some work has been initiated in the relativistic framework , qhd eft , using the local fermi gas ( lfg ) approximation and including one - body currents @xcite .",
    "the two - body current was investigated relativistically in @xcite .",
    "these works mainly focus on electron scattering .",
    "but the handling of the @xmath1 resonance in these papers is somewhat phenomenological .",
    "moreover , in both nonrelativistic and relativistic studies , photon production is rarely investigated .    in this paper",
    ", we also apply the lfg approximation @xcite to study the one - body current contribution .",
    "as shown in @xcite , we make use of meson dominance to generate form factors for various currents . because of the built in symmetries in the lagrangian , conservation of vector current and the partial conservation of axial current are satisfied .",
    "these properties are well preserved in the lfg approximation . especially for photon production ,",
    "vector current conservation is crucial .",
    "the @xmath1 dynamics , as a key component in this work , is explored to some extent .",
    "we introduce interactions between @xmath1 and non - goldstone meson fields to generate the spin - orbit ( s - l ) coupling that has been introduced in phenomenological models @xcite . on the other hand , phenomenological knowledge about s - l coupling",
    "puts constraints on these couplings .",
    "moreover , the @xmath1 decay width increases in the nucleus , because more decay channels are opened up and this effect overcomes the reduction of pion decay phase space . here",
    "we follow the phenomenological studies and separate the width to the pion decay width and anything else parametrized by the imaginary part of the @xmath1 spreading potential . as a result of opening new decay channels ,",
    "the flux having excited a @xmath1 resonance can be transferred to channels that do not involve pion or photon production .",
    "moreover , pauli blocking can reduce the pion and photon production cross section further , because of the reduction of the final particle s phase space . in this paper , we explore how both @xmath1 and nonresonant contributions are reduced compared to those in free nucleon scattering .",
    "however , we do not include fsi effects for pions and knocked out nucleons .",
    "the simple treatment can be found in @xcite , while the complete treatment is implemented in various event generators of experiments ( e.g. , nuance @xcite ) , and the gibuu model @xcite .",
    "hence we only compare our predictions with the output of nuance without fsi . dominates .",
    "the axial mass @xmath13 gev is used which is the same as that used by the miniboone experiment for their _ baseline _ calculations @xcite .",
