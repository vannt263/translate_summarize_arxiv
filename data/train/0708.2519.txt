    "an interesting difference between the x=0.08 and the 0.095 la@xmath0ba@xmath1cuo@xmath2  samples is that the spin ordered state in the x=0.095 sample grows within a fully developed ltt structure , as t@xmath5@xmath339.5 k and t@xmath29@xmath3 45 k. by contrast , in the x=0.08 la@xmath0ba@xmath1cuo@xmath2  sample , the mto to ltt structural phase transition begins near t@xmath5 on decreasing temperature and is only completed at temperatures below @xmath3 20 k. the situation for x=0.125 la@xmath0ba@xmath1cuo@xmath2  is similar to the x=0.095 case , as t@xmath5@xmath3 50 k , at which temperature the mto - ltt transition for x=0.125 is largely complete .",

    "<S> using neutron scattering techniques , we have studied incommensurate spin ordering as well as low energy spin dynamics in single crystal underdoped la@xmath0ba@xmath1cuo@xmath2   with x@xmath30.095 and 0.08 ; high temperature superconductors with t@xmath4 27 k and 29 k respectively . </S>",
    "<S> static two dimensional incommensurate magnetic order appears below t@xmath5=39.5 @xmath6 0.3 k in la@xmath0ba@xmath1cuo@xmath2(x=0.095 ) and a similar temperature for x=0.08 within the low temperature tetragonal phase . </S>",
    "<S> the spin order is unaffected by either the onset of superconductivity or the application of magnetic fields of up to 7 tesla applied along the c - axis in the x=0.095 sample . such magnetic field _ </S>",
    "<S> independent _ behaviour is in marked contrast with the field induced enhancement of the staggered magnetisation observed in the related la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2  system , indicating this phenomenon is not a universal property of cuprate superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , we find that incommensurability @xmath7 is only weakly dependent on doping relative to la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> dispersive excitations in la@xmath0ba@xmath1cuo@xmath2  ( x=0.095 ) at the same incommensurate wavevector persist up to at least 60 k. the dynamical spin susceptibility of the low energy spin excitations saturates below t@xmath8 , in a similar manner to that seen in the superconducting state of la@xmath9cuo@xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> the roles of spin , charge and lattice degrees of freedom have been central to the rich behaviour brought to light over the last 20 years in superconducting lamellar copper oxides  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the cuprates exhibit phenomena which are a sensitive function of doping , evolving from an antiferromagnetic insulating parent compound into a superconducting phase with increasing hole density . a heterogeneous electronic phase composed of stripes of itinerant charges now appears to be a generic feature of hole doped ternary transition metal oxides  @xcite such as manganites  @xcite and nickelates  @xcite , as well as cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> the explanation for these incommensurate spin ordered states is the subject of ongoing debate . in an itinerant picture , </S>",
    "<S> the spin dynamics are described in terms of electron - hole pair excitations about an underlying fermi surface  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , within the stripe picture of doped , two dimensional mott insulators , the non - magnetic holes in these materials organize into quasi - one dimensional stripes which separate antiferromagnetic insulating antiphase domains  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> adjacent antiferromagnetic regions are @xmath11 out of phase with each other giving rise to a magnetic structure with incommensurate periodicity , where the supercell dimension is twice the hole stripe periodicity .    </S>",
    "<S> the static spin structures in the undoped , parent compounds such as la@xmath9cuo@xmath12  @xcite or yba@xmath9cu@xmath13o@xmath14  @xcite have been determined by neutron scattering to be relatively simple two sublattice antiferromagnets characterized by a commensurate ordering wavevector of ( 0.5,0.5 ) in reciprocal lattice units within the tetragonal basal plane . on hole doping with either sr substituting for la in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath12  @xcite or by adding additional oxygen in yba@xmath9cu@xmath13o@xmath15  @xcite , the magnetic scattering moves out to incommensurate wavevectors , consistent with the stripe ordering picture described above . </S>",
    "<S> this incommensurate magnetism can be either static or dynamic , as evidenced by either elastic or inelastic peaks in the neutron scattering respectively and now appears to be a common feature of the la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2   family of compounds . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , for lightly doped la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath12 , elastic incommensurate magnetic bragg features first appear split off from the ( 0.5,0.5 ) position in diagonal directions relative to a tetragonal unit cell  @xcite . at higher doping in the underdoped superconducting regime , </S>",
    "<S> the peaks rotate by 45@xmath16 to lie along directions parallel to the tetragonal axes or cu - o - cu bonds , such that elastic magnetic scattering appears at ( 0.5@xmath6@xmath17,0.5,0 ) and ( 0.5,0.5@xmath6@xmath17,0 )  @xcite . for optimal and higher doping </S>",
    "<S> the static order disappears , but dynamic incommensurate correlations nevertheless persist@xcite .    within the stripe picture , </S>",
    "<S> one expects charge ordering associated with the holes to occur at an incommensurate wavevector @xmath18 , twice that describing the spin order . </S>",
    "<S> neutron scattering is not directly sensitive to charge ordering _ per se _ , but it is sensitive to atomic displacements , such as those associated with oxygen , which arise from charge ordering . an incommensurate nuclear scattering signature is therefore expected to appear at ( 2@xmath62@xmath17,0,0 ) or ( 2,@xmath19,0 ) and related wavevectors . despite extensive efforts , such incommensurate charge related scattering has not been observed in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath12 by either neutron or x - ray scattering techniques , although there is indirect evidence of charge stripe excitations from optical measurements  @xcite . </S>",
