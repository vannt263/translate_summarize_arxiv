    "we consider a permutation of length @xmath4 simply to be a sequence containing exactly one copy of each element of the set @xmath5 .",
    "a permutation @xmath6 of length @xmath7 is said to be a _ subpermutation _ of another permutation @xmath8 , written @xmath9 , if @xmath8 has a subsequence of length @xmath7 whose terms occur in the same relative order as those of @xmath6 . for example , @xmath10 is a subpermutation of @xmath11 since @xmath12 has the same relative order as @xmath10 .",
    "a _ permutation class _ is a downset of permutations under this subpermutation order ; thus if @xmath8 is a member of a permutation class @xmath13 and @xmath9 , then @xmath14 . if @xmath15 is a set of permutations , we use @xmath16 to denote the members of @xmath15 of length @xmath4 .",
    "the _ growth rate _ of a permutation class @xmath13 is defined by the limit @xmath17{|\\ccc_n|},\\ ] ] if it exists .",
    "there are no known examples of permutation classes for which this limit does not exist and it is widely believed ( @xcite conjecture  1.1 ) that every permutation class does indeed have a growth rate .",
    "the proof by marcus & tardos  @xcite of the stanley  wilf conjecture implies that growth rates are finite except in the case of the class of all permutations .",
    "what does the set of possible permutation class growth rates look like ?",
    "the last few years have seen substantial progress on answering this question , with particular focus on significant phase transition values .",
    "kaiser & klazar  @xcite characterised all growth rates up to 2 , showing that the golden ratio @xmath18 ( the unique positive root of @xmath19 ) is the least growth rate greater than 1 .",
    "indeed , they prove a stronger statement , known as the _ fibonacci dichotomy _ , that if @xmath20 is ever less than the @xmath4th fibonacci number , then @xmath20 is eventually polynomial ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "kaiser & klazar also determine that 2 is the least limit point in the set of growth rates .",
    "klazar  @xcite considered the least growth rate admitting uncountably many permutation classes ( which he denoted @xmath21 ) and proved that @xmath21 is at least 2 and is no greater than approximately @xmath22 ( a root of a quintic ) .",
    "vatter  @xcite determined the exact value of @xmath21 to be the unique real root of @xmath23 ( approximately @xmath24 ) and completed the characterisation of all growth rates up to @xmath21 , proving that there are uncountably many permutation classes with growth rate @xmath21 and only countably many with growth rate less than @xmath21 .",
    "the phase transition at @xmath21 also has enumerative ramifications : albert , rukuc & vatter  @xcite have shown that every permutation class with growth rate less than @xmath21 has a rational generating function .",
    "balogh , bollobs & morris  @xcite extended kaiser & klazar s work to the more general setting of _ ordered graphs_. an ordered graph is a graph with a linear order on its vertices . to each permutation",
    "we associate an ordered graph .",
    "the ( ordered ) _ graph _ of a permutation @xmath8 of length  @xmath4 has vertex set @xmath5 with an edge between vertices @xmath25 and @xmath26 if @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "see the figures below for illustrations .",
    "we use @xmath29 to denote the graph of @xmath8 .",
    "an _ induced ordered subgraph _ of an ordered graph @xmath30 is an induced subgraph of @xmath30 that inherits its vertex ordering .",
    "a set of ordered graphs closed under taking induced ordered subgraphs is known as a _",
    "hereditary class_. it is easy to see that @xmath9 if and only if @xmath31 is an induced ordered subgraph of @xmath29 .",
    "thus each permutation class is isomorphic to a hereditary class of ordered graphs , and results can be transferred between the two domains .",
    "balogh , bollobs & morris conjectured that the set of growth rates of hereditary classes of ordered graphs contains no limit points from above , and also that all such growth rates are integers or algebraic irrationals .",
    "these conjectures were disproved by albert & linton  @xcite who exhibited an uncountable _ perfect set _ ( a closed set every member of which is a limit point ) of growth rates of permutation classes and in turn conjectured that the set of growth rates includes some interval @xmath32 .",
    "their conjecture was established by vatter  @xcite who proved that there are permutation classes of every growth rate at least @xmath2 ( the unique real root of @xmath33 ) .",
    "in addition , he conjectured that this value was optimal , the set of growth rates below @xmath3 being nowhere dense . by generalising vatter",
    "s constructions , we now refute his conjecture by proving the following two results :    in order to complete the characterisation of all permutation class growth rates , further investigation is required of the values between @xmath21 and @xmath34 .",
    "this interval contains the first limit point from above ( which we denote @xmath35 ) and the first perfect set ( whose infimum we denote @xmath36 ) , as well as the first interval ( whose infimum we denote @xmath37 ) . in  @xcite",
    ", vatter showed that @xmath38 ( the unique real root of @xmath39 ) is the infimum of a perfect set in the set of growth rates and hence a limit point from above , and conjectured that this is the least such limit point ( in which case @xmath40 ) .",
    "if @xmath41 denotes the set of all permutation class growth rates , then the current state of our knowledge can be summarised by the following table :          the author is grateful to vince vatter for suggesting that it might be worthwhile investigating whether his conjecture concerning the behaviour below @xmath3 may in fact be false .",
    "he would also like to thank vince , robert brignall and two referees for reading earlier drafts of this paper ; their feedback resulted in significant improvements to its presentation ."
