    "these deficits also appear in present lattice - qcd calculations and may be due to the fact that the models being used are not fully implementing a treatment of resonance decay @xcite .",

    "this is much more involved than in pseudoscalar meson photoproduction where , in principle , only 8 observables suffice , however it is similar to other channels such as double pseudoscalar meson photoproduction .",
    "it is well known that @xmath5-channel processes dominate @xmath0 photoproduction at high energies . however , in the threshold vicinity , previous experiments indicate that @xmath4-channel processes also contribute ( see for example refs .",
