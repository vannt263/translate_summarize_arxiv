    "it is generally agreed that stars form through the collapse of gas clouds in interstellar medium while planets form either through coagulation of dust in protostellar disks or gravitational instabilities of the gas disk . by contrast , there exist diverse mechanisms proposed to explain the formation of objects with masses between stars and planets , i.e.  very low - mass stars and brown dwarfs , including dynamical interaction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , photoionizing radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , disk instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , turbulent fragmentation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , etc .",
    "see @xcite for detailed review .    in order to test formation theories of very low - mass ( vlm ) objects , various types of observations are needed . in this sense ,",
    "observational studies of binaries composed of vlm objects are important because predictions of binary properties vary considerably among formation theories .",
    "for example , the dynamical interaction and the disk instability mechanisms predict few widely separated binaries while other mechanisms make no concrete predictions on such a trend . furthermore , with the exception of extreme microlensing events",
    "@xcite and astrometric microlensing @xcite binaries provide the only channel to measure model - independent physical parameters including masses .",
    "unfortunately , comprehensive studies of vlm binaries have been difficult due to the lack of unbiased samples .",
    "most known low - mass binaries have been discovered by direct imaging ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . due to the intrinsic nature , faint or dark vlm objects can not be seen by this method and thus the sample favors binaries with luminous components and roughly equal masses , although some binaries found by other methods such as the `` astrometric variable '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and `` blended light spectroscopy '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have little or no such bias .",
    "in addition , since it is difficult to detect closely separated ( @xmath6 au ) binary systems due to the limitation set by angular resolution , the sample is biased toward widely separated binaries . for the same reason , the sample is confined to binaries in the solar neighborhood . furthermore , spectroscopic radial - velocity observations for these objects are difficult due to their faintness and thus it is difficult to precisely measure their masses .    because of the difference in sensitivity from other methods , gravitational microlensing provides a complementary tool to study vlm objects .",
    "microlensing occurs due to the bending of light caused by the gravity of a lensing object located between an observer and a lensed star ( source ) . as a result ,",
    "the phenomenon does not depend on the brightness of lensing objects , making it possible to detect faint and even dark objects .",
    "lensing events occur in galactic scale and thus the method can be used to detect vlm binaries distributed over a wide range of galactocentric distances .",
    "in addition , the method is sensitive to tight binaries with small separations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for well observed binary - lens events , it is possible to precisely measure binary masses without additional follow - up observations .",
    "the method already demonstrated the usefulness in detecting vlm objects existing in various forms , e.g. a free - floating brown dwarf @xcite , binary brown dwarfs @xcite , brown dwarfs around stars @xcite , and a brown dwarf orbited by a planetary mass object @xcite .    in this paper , we report a low - mass binary discovered from the observation of the microlensing event ogle-2013-blg-0102 .",
    "we demonstrate that the binary is composed of a primary near the hydrogen - burning limit and a companion near the deuterium - burning limit .",
    "the lensing event ogle-2013-blg-0102 occurred on a star located toward the galactic bulge direction with the equatorial coordinates @xmath7 , corresponding to the galactic coordinates @xmath8 .",
    "the event was first discovered by the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) collaboration from the survey conducted toward the galactic bulge field using the 1.3 m warsaw telescope at las campanas observatory in chile and the discovery was announced to the microlensing community on march 2 , 2013 .",
    "the event was independently discovered by the microlensing observations in astrophysics ( moa : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) collaboration using the 1.8 m telescope at mt .",
    "john observatory in new zealand and dubbed as moa-2013-blg-127 .",
    "the moa group noticed that the event had undergone an anomaly and issued a further alert for follow - up observations .",
    "no immediate follow - up observation could be done because the anomaly occurred during the very early bulge season when the duration of the bulge visibility was short and telescopes for follow - up observations were not fully operational .",
    "fortunately , the cadence of the survey observations was high enough to delineate the anomaly covering both the rising and falling parts of the anomaly .    from modeling of the light curve conducted by the time that the anomaly ended",
    ", it was suggested that the anomaly was produced by the crossing of a caustic formed by a binary lens where the mass ratio between the components is low . in response to the potential importance of the event , the microlensing follow - up network ( @xmath9fun : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) collaboration took multiband images ( 14 images in @xmath10 band and 12 images in @xmath11 band ) during april 25  june 29 period using the 1.3 m smarts telescope of cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) in chile to obtain the color information of the source star .",
    "the event lasted more than 100 days after the anomaly . from multiple stage real - time modeling of the light curve conducted with the progress of the event ,",
    "it was suggested that higher - order effects would be needed to precisely describe the event .",
    "figure  [ fig : one ] shows the light curve of the event .",
    "it is characterized by a strong short - term anomaly centered at @xmath12 superposed on a smooth brightness variation of the source star .",
    "the event lasted throughout the whole bulge season and the anomaly lasted @xmath13 4 days .",
    "data sets used for analysis were reduced using photometry codes developed by the individual groups , which are based on difference image analysis @xcite . for the use of data sets processed by different photometry systems , we readjust error bars . in this process , we first add a quadratic term so that the cumulative distribution of @xmath14 sorted by magnification becomes approximately linear .",
    "we then rescale the error bars so that @xmath14 per degree of freedom @xmath15 for each data set becomes unity @xcite .",
    "the first process is needed to ensure that the dispersion of data points is consistent with error bars regardless of the source brightness .",
    "the second process is required to ensure that each data set is fairly weighted according to error bars .",
    "we eliminate @xmath16 outliers in the analysis in order to minimize their effect on modeling .",
