    "increasing incidence of infectious diseases such as the sars and the recent a(h1n1 ) pandemic influenza , has led to the scientific community to build models in order to understand the epidemic spreading and to develop efficient strategies to protect the society  @xcite .",
    "since one of the goals of the health authorities is to minimize the economic impact of the health policies , many theoretical studies are oriented to establish how the strategies maintain the functionality of a society at the least economic cost .",
    "the simplest model that mimics diseases where individuals acquire permanent immunity , such as the influenza , is the pioneer susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) model  @xcite . in this epidemiological model",
    "the individuals can be in one of the three states : i ) susceptible , which corresponds to a healthy individual who has no immunity , ii ) infected , @xmath1 a non - healthy individual and iii ) recovered , that corresponds to an individual who can not propagate anymore the disease because he is immune or dead . in this model",
    "the infected individuals transmit the disease to the susceptible ones , and recover after a certain time since they were infected .",
    "the process stops when the disease reaches the steady state , @xmath1 , when all infected individuals recover .",
    "it is known that , in this process , the final fraction of recovered individuals is the order parameter of a second order phase transition .",
    "the phase transition is governed by a control parameter which is the effective probability of infection or transmissibility @xmath2 of the disease . above a critical threshold @xmath3 ,",
    "the disease becomes an epidemic , while for @xmath4 the disease reaches only a small fraction of the population ( outbreaks )  @xcite .",
    "the first sir model , called random mixing model , assumes that all contacts are possible , thus the infection can spread through all of them .",
    "however , in realistic epidemic processes individuals have contact only with a limited set of neighbors . as a consequence , in the last two decades",
    "the study of epidemic spreading has incorporated a contact network framework , in which nodes are the individuals and the links represent the interactions between them .",
    "this approach has been very successful not only in an epidemiological context but also in economy , sociology and informatics  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the topology of the network , @xmath1 the diverse patterns of connections between individuals plays an important role in many processes such as in epidemic spreading  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the degree distribution @xmath5 that indicates the fraction of nodes with @xmath6 links ( or degree @xmath6 ) is the most used characterization of the network topology .",
    "according to their degree distribution , networks are classified in i ) homogeneous , where node s connectivities are around the average degree @xmath7 and ii ) heterogeneous , in which there are many nodes with small connectivities but also some nodes , called hubs or super - spreaders , with a huge amount of connections .",
    "the most popular homogeneous networks is the erds rnyi ( er ) network  @xcite characterized by a poisson degree distribution @xmath8 . on the other hand ,",
    "very heterogeneous networks are represented by scale - free ( sf ) distributions with @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , where @xmath11 represents the heterogeneity of the network .",
    "historically , processes on top of complex networks were focused on homogeneous networks since they are analytically tractable .",
    "however , different researches showed that real social  @xcite , technological  @xcite , biological  @xcite networks , etc , are very heterogeneous .",
    "other works showed that the sir model , at its steady state , is related to link percolation  @xcite . in percolation processes  @xcite , links are occupied with probability @xmath12 . above a critical threshold @xmath13 ,",
    "a giant component ( gc ) emerges , which size is of the order of the system size @xmath14 ; while below @xmath15 there are only finite clusters .",
    "the relative size of the gc , @xmath16 , is the order parameter of a geometric second order phase transition at the critical threshold @xmath15 . using a generating function formalism  @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the sir model in its steady state and link percolation belong to the same universality class and that the order parameter of the sir model can be exactly mapped with the order parameter @xmath17 of link percolation  @xcite .",
    "for homogeneous networks the exponents of the transitions have mean field ( mf ) value , although for very heterogeneous network the exponents depend on @xmath11 .",
    "almost all the researches on epidemics were concentrated in studying the behavior of the infected individuals .",
    "however , an important issue is how the susceptible network behaves when a disease spreads .",
    "recently , valdez _ et .",
    "@xcite studied the behavior of the giant susceptible component ( gsc ) that is the functional network , since the gsc is the one that supports the economy of a society .",
    "they found that the susceptible network also overcomes a second order phase transition where the dilution of the gsc during the first epidemic spreading can be described as a `` node void percolation '' process , which belongs to the same universality class that intentional attack process with mf exponents .",
    "understanding the behavior of the susceptible individuals allows to find strategies to slow down the epidemic spread , protecting the healthy network .",
    "various strategies has been proposed to halt the epidemic spreading .",
    "for example , vaccination programs are very efficient in providing immunity to individuals , decreasing the final number of infected people  @xcite",
    ". however , these strategies are usually very expensive and vaccines against new strains are not always available during the epidemic spreading . as a consequence ,",
    "non - pharmaceutical interventions are needed to protect the society .",
    "one of the most effective and studied strategies to halt an epidemic is quarantine  @xcite but it has the disadvantage that full isolation has a negative impact on the economy of a region and is difficult to implement in a large population .",
    "therefore , other measures , such as social distancing strategies can be implemented in order to reduce the average contact time between individuals .",
    "these `` social distancing strategies '' that reduce the average contact time , usually include closing schools , cough etiquette , travel restrictions , etc .",
    "these measures may not prevent a pandemic , but could delay its spread .    in this review ,",
    "we revisit two social distancing strategies named , `` social distancing induced by quenched disorder ''  @xcite and `` intermittent social distancing '' ( isd ) strategy  @xcite , which model the behavior of individuals who preserve their contacts during the disease spreading . in the former ,",
    "links are static but health authorities induce a disorder on the links by recommending people to decrease the duration of their contacts to control the epidemic spreading . in the latter , we consider intermittent connections where the susceptible individuals , using local information , break the links with their infected neighbors with probability @xmath18 during an interval @xmath19 after which they reestablish the connections with their previous contacts .",
    "we apply these strategies to the sir model and found that both models still maps with link percolation and that they may halt the epidemic spreading .",
    "finally , we show that the transmissibility does not govern the temporal evolution of the epidemic spreading , it still contains information about the velocity of the spreading .",
    "one of the most studied version of the sir model is the time continuous kermack - mckendrick  @xcite formulation , where an infected individual transmits the disease to a susceptible neighbor at a rate @xmath20 and recovers at a rate @xmath21 .",
    "while this sir version has been widely studied in the epidemiology literature , it has the drawback to allow some individuals to recover almost instantly after being infected , which is a highly unrealistic situation since any disease has a characteristic recovering average time . in order to overcome this shortcoming",
    ", many studies use the discrete reed - frost model  @xcite , where an infected individual transmits the disease to a susceptible neighbor with probability @xmath20 and recovers @xmath22 time units after he was infected . in this model ,",
    "the transmissibility @xmath2 that represents the overall probability at which an individual infects one susceptible neighbor before recover , is given by @xmath23    it is known that the order parameter @xmath24 , which is the final fraction of recovered individuals , overcomes a second order phase transition at a critical threshold @xmath25 , which depends on the network structure .",
    "one of the most important features of the reed - frost model ( that we will hereon call sir model ) is that it can be mapped into a link percolation process  @xcite , which means that is possible to study an epidemiological model using statistical physic tools .",
    "heuristically , the relation between sir and link percolation holds because the effective probability @xmath2 that a link is traversed by the disease , is equivalent in a link percolation process to the occupancy probability @xmath12 . as a consequence ,",
    "both process have the same threshold and belong to the same universality class .",
    "moreover , each realization of the sir model corresponds to a single cluster of link percolation .",
    "this feature is particularly relevant for the mapping between the order parameters @xmath17 of link percolation and @xmath26 for epidemics , as we will explain below .    for the simulations , in the initial stage all the individuals are in the susceptible state .",
    "we choose a node at random from the network and infect it ( patient zero ) .",
    "then , the spreading process goes as follows : after all infected individuals try to infect their susceptible neighbor with a probability @xmath20 , and those individuals that has been infected for @xmath22 time steps recover , the time @xmath27 increases in one .",
    "the spreading process ends when the last infected individual recovers ( steady state ) .    in a sir realization ,",
    "only one infected cluster emerges for any value of @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast , in a percolation process , for @xmath28 many clusters with a cluster size distribution are generated  @xcite . therefore we must use a criteria to distinguish between epidemics ( gc in percolation ) and outbreaks ( finite clusters ) .",
    "the cluster size distribution over many realizations of the sir process , close but above criticality , has a gap between small clusters ( outbreaks ) and big clusters ( epidemics ) .",
    "thus , defining a cutoff @xmath29 in the cluster size as the minimum value before the gap interval , all the diseases below @xmath29 are considered as outbreaks and the rest as epidemics ( see fig .",
    "[ sc11]a ) .",
    "note that @xmath30 will depend on @xmath14 .",
    "then , averaging only those sir realizations whose size exceeds the cutoff @xmath29 , we found that the fraction of recovered individuals @xmath26 maps exactly with @xmath16 ( see fig .",
    "[ sc11]b ) . for our simulations",
    ", we use @xmath31 for @xmath32",
    ".    vbmbfig01.eps ( 80,50)*(a ) *    vbmbfig02.eps ( 85,50)*(b ) *    it can be shown that using the appropriate cutoff , close to criticality , all the exponents that characterizes the transition are the same for both processes  @xcite .",
    "thus , above but close to criticality @xmath33 with  @xcite @xmath34 the exponent @xmath35 of the finite cluster size distribution in percolation close to criticality is given by @xmath36 for the sir model and for a branching process ( see sec .  [ mathperc ] ) , there is only one `` epidemic '' cluster , thus near criticality the probability of a cluster of size @xmath37 , @xmath38 , has exponent @xmath39 , where @xmath35 is given by eq .",

    "[ sc11]a ) . for sf networks with @xmath40 , in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the critical threshold is zero , and there is not percolation phase transition . on the other hand ,",
    "for @xmath41 and er networks , all the exponents take the mean field ( mf ) values .",
    "given a network with a degree distribution @xmath5 , the probability to reach a node with a degree @xmath6 by following a randomly chosen link on the graph , is equal to @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the average degree .",
    "this is because the probability of reaching a given node by following a randomly chosen link is proportional to the number of links @xmath6 of that node and @xmath43 is needed for normalization .",
    "note that , if we arrive to a node with degree @xmath6 following a random chosen link , the total number of outgoing links or branches of that node is @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the probability to arrive at a node with @xmath45 outgoing branches by following a randomly chosen link is also @xmath46 .",
    "this probability is called excess degree probability  @xcite .    in order to obtain the critical threshold of link percolation , let us consider a randomly chosen and occupied link .",

    "we will denote a cayley tree as a _",
    "single _ tree with a given degree distribution .",
    "notice that link percolation can be thought as many realizations of cayley tree with occupancy probability @xmath12 , which give rise to many clusters . by simplicity",
    "we first consider a cayley tree as a deterministic graph with a fixed number @xmath47 of links per node . assuming that @xmath48 , the probability that starting from an occupied link we can not reach the @xmath49 shell through a path composed by occupied links , is given by @xmath50 ^ 2.\\ ] ] here",

    "we explain how an epidemic affects the structure of the functional network in the steady state .",
    "we define `` active '' links as those links pairing infected and susceptible individuals . during the epidemic spreading ,",

    "living in society implies that individuals are constantly interacting with each other .",
    "interactions may take different forms , but those involving proximity or direct contact are of special interest because they are potential bridges to propagate infections .",
    "empirical data suggest that human contacts follow a broad distribution @xcite .",
    "these results support the idea that social interactions are heterogeneous , that means that individuals have a lot of acquaintances but just a few of them are close contacts .",
    "this heterogeneity between contacts can be thought as a network with quenched disorder on the links , wherein the disorder is given by a broad distribution .",
    "for example , if the weights represent the duration of the contacts between two individuals  @xcite , the larger the weight , the easier is for an infection to traverse the link .",
    "an important feature of the networks topology without disorder is the shortest average distance @xmath108 , defined as the minimum average number of connections between all pairs of nodes , which behaves as @xmath109 for er networks  @xcite and as @xmath110 for very heterogeneous networks .",
    "this is why these networks are the called small or ultra small world  @xcite .",
    "it is known that the disorder can dramatically alter some topological properties of networks .",
    "several studies have shown that when the disorder between connections is very broad or heterogeneous , also called strong disorder limit ( sd ) , the network loses the small world property and the average distance goes as a power of @xmath14 for er and sf networks with @xmath111 due to the fact that the sd can be related to percolation at criticality @xcite",
    ". however , the exact mapping between the order parameter of both second order phase transitions of percolation and sir is not affected by a random disorder .    in the real life ,",
    "the disorder in the network can be modified by health policies in order to , for example , delay the disease spreading allowing the health services to make earlier interventions @xcite .",
    "using different methods like broadcasting , brochures or masks distributions , the public health agencies can induce people to change their effective contact time and therefore the heterogeneity of the interactions .",
    "this strategy was tacitly used by some governments in the recent wave of influenza a(h1n1 ) epidemic in 2009 @xcite , but until now the effectiveness of the strategy and how it depends on the virulence and the structure of the disease has not been widely studied .",
    "we study how the heterogeneity of the disorder affects the disease spreading in the sir model for a theoretical quenched disorder distribution with a control parameter for its broadness . using a theoretical disorder distribution given by , @xmath112 where @xmath113 in [ @xmath114,1 ] , and @xmath115 is the parameter which controls the width of the weight distribution and determines the strength of the disorder .",

    "this is an example of adaptive network where the topology coevolves with the dynamical process  @xcite .    specifically , we study an intermittent social distancing strategy ( isd ) in which susceptible individuals , in order to decrease the probability of infection , break ( or inactivate ) with probability @xmath18 their links with infected neighbors for intermittent periods of length @xmath19 .",

    "these dynamic rules generate an intermittent connectivity between susceptible and infected individuals that may halt the disease spreading . in the limit case of @xmath152 ,",
    "the isd strategy is equivalent to a permanent disconnection , because when the link is restored the infected neighbor is recovered ( or dead ) and can not transmit the disease anymore .    in order to compute the transmissibility for this strategy",

[ distribfin ] ) .",
    "thus it is expected that the final times @xmath234 in the former will be longer than in the latter . on the other hand , the ratio between the average times @xmath235 is compatible with ratio between the most probable final times of the distributions @xmath236 and @xmath213 .",
    "these results show that we can use minimal information , specifically the terms of the transmissibility in order to determine if the strategy slows down the epidemic spreading .",
    "since one of the goals of the health authorities is to have more time to intervene , the average time @xmath233 could be used to compare , design or optimize mitigation strategies .",
    "percolation theory offers the possibility to explain the epidemic spreading and mitigation strategies in geometrical terms . in this brief review",
    ", we focused on the applications of percolation theory for the studying of social distancing strategies against the epidemic spreading of the sir model .",
    "we described the dilution of the network composed by susceptible individuals due to the disease spreading as a `` node void percolation '' process , and remark its importance in the development of strategies that aims to protect the functional network .    using the sir model for the disease propagation , we presented two social distancing strategies : the quenched disorder strategy and the intermittent social distancing strategy .",
    "we found that both strategies can control the effective transmissibility in order to protect the society .",
    "in particular , we described the protection of the gsc through the formation of a susceptible herd behavior . on the other hand",
    ", we showed that while the effective transmissibility control the final fraction of recovered individuals and the size of the gsc , it does not control observables that depends on the dynamical evolution of the process , such as the distribution of the duration of an epidemic .",
    "one of the advantages of having two strategies that map with percolation theory is that we can fix the transmissibility in order to compare them and highlight the features of each strategy .",
    "thus , for example , the knowledge of the mean time @xmath235 that a disease requires to traverse an active link , can be used to determine which strategy is better in delaying the epidemic spreading . using the terms of the transmissibility",
    ", we showed that the quenched disorder strategy increases this average time , and thus the epidemic spreading is delayed compared to the isd strategy .",
    "our results show that a disorder strategy has a deeper effect on the spreading dynamics than a local adaptive topology .",
    "our findings could themselves have important applications for improving or designing mitigation strategies , since new strains of bacterias and viruses are continuously emerging or reemerging in multi - drug resistant forms , demanding the development of non - pharmaceutical intervention .",

    "we thank c. e. la rocca for useful comments and discussions .",
    "the edge - based compartmental model  @xcite , is a new theoretical framework to describe the dynamic of the disease spreading in the sir model . using this approach",
    "we can obtain the relation between @xmath91 and @xmath101 .    for clarity ,",
    "we return to the sir terminology , in which a void node corresponds to a susceptible individual and the node belonging to the giant percolating cluster ( in a branching process ) corresponds to a recovered individual .",
    "consider an epidemic disease in the steady state .",
    "we randomly choose a link and then give a direction to that link , in which the node in the target of the arrow is called the root , and the base is its neighbor .",
