    "it is well established that active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity is due to accretion onto super massive black holes ( smbhs ) .",
    "additionally , smbhs are found to be common , existing in most , if not all , massive galaxies .",
    "observationally , the smbh mass is found to be tightly correlated to the bulge velocity dispersion raised to the fourth power @xcite .",
    "however , the bulge extends well outside the gravitational influence of the smbh .",
    "this correlation has led to the hypothesis that the bulge and smbh co - evolve @xcite .",
    "additionally , models of galaxy evolution must include regulation mechanisms to adjust and quench star formation in massive galaxies after early times to prevent the over production of bright galaxies @xcite .",
    "evidence pointing toward the co - evolution of smbhs / bulges and the need for regulation mechanisms has led to models which utilize agn feedback to quench star formation .",
    "an example of a model of relevance to our studies is the hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite . in this model ,",
    "gas rich mergers induce gas inflow triggering both star formation and quasar activity .",
    "some small percentage of agn energy output is converted to thermal energy , assisting in the stoppage of further star formation and accretion .",
    "simulations , which feature self - regulated smbh growth , have been successful in reproducing various observables , such as the bimodal colour - magnitude distribution @xcite .",
    "however these models must operate on a very large range of scales ( @xmath2 - @xmath3 ) and must incorporate many physical processes . therefore it is desirable to further constrain these models observationally . the goal of this work is to develop an off - axis method to provide stellar age and host colour constraints during the quasar phase .",

    "modulo deficiencies in agn unification models , quasar hosts can be studied via their narrow - line counter - parts . from 4000  break measurements",
    ", k03 find that high luminosity agn have younger mean stellar ages than normal early - type galaxies .",
    "additionally , they find a large fraction of powerful type 2 agn have experienced significant starbursts in the past 1 - 2 gyr .",
    "this is similar to our findings : @xmath6 gyrs for the radio bright sample and @xmath7 myrs for radio faint sample .",
    "however , there is little overlap in luminosity between our samples .",
    "the k03 powerful ( l[oiii]@xmath8 ) agn are about one magnitude fainter than our sample s nuclear luminosities .",
    "a smaller more luminous sample of sdss narrow - line agn has been examined by @xcite . in qualitative agreement with k03",
    ", they too find evidence for relatively blue / young host galaxies .",

    "the agn probed by this study are comparable in luminosity to the k03 sample .",
    "m06 find a clear bimodal distribution for the mean light - weighted stellar age among star - forming and passive galaxies .",
    "as summarized in table 5 , median values of @xmath9 for star - forming galaxies and @xmath10 for passive galaxies are found .",
    "the green valley is located at @xmath11 and the median @xmath12 for agn hosts is 9.66 .",
    "the m06 median @xmath12 for agn hosts is heavily weighted toward the more numerous low luminosity objects . in agreement with k03 , they find that the typical @xmath12 decreases for more luminous agn .",
    "our radio bright sample with @xmath13 is in close proximity to the green valley ( slightly younger and bluer ) .",
    "we find the radio faint sample with @xmath14 to fall very close to the peak of star - forming distribution .",
    "qualitatively we find this to be in overall agreement with our colour - magnitude diagram , fig . 6 .",
    "v06 study the host galaxies of 4,666 local broad - line agn .",
    "like k03 and m06 , they find that higher luminosity agn hosts are bluer /younger than normal early - type galaxies .",
    "this sample contains @xmath15 quasars with luminosities comparable to our study .",
    "however , the model employed by v06 fails when the on - axis host flux fraction falls below 10% or when the signal - to - noise is less than 10 .",
    "these criteria prevent the study of @xmath16 of their luminous objects and would exclude the majority of the objects ( 7 of 10 ) in this study .",
    "we have presented an off - axis technique to spectroscopically constrain the colour and the stellar ages of quasar ( @xmath0 ) host galaxies .",
    "our method draws heavily from the quiescent galaxy model of cf05 , utilizing a basis of bc03 ssps and @xcite dust extinction in a similar fashion . complicating our @xmath17 fitting",

    "scattered light is modeled by altering the the observed nuclear spectrum by a low order polynomial , while simultaneously fitting the constituent stellar populations of the host galaxy .",
    "furthermore , monte - carlo simulations are tailored to each observed pointing .",
    "thus , the ability of the model to recover known parameters from synthetic spectra is determined .",
    "it is found that quasar host _",
    "b - v _ colour and @xmath12 are well recovered .",
    "these parameters are then compared to previous studies .",
    "overall consensus is found giving further credence to our model ( however , see appendix a for discussion of individual cases that potentially disagree with previous results ) .    our method probes a population of luminous quasars unattainable by most other techniques .",
    "the stellar properties of this population have yet to be determined for a large well defined sample . for the smaller sample ( @xmath18 )",
    "studies that can access this luminous regime , our method can be used in conjunction to gain further insight . for example",
    ", our technique can observe the off - axis ( @xmath19@xmath20 ) stellar content of objects ( nucleus - to - host ratio@xmath2115 ) inaccessible to the on - axis studies of j07 and l07 .",
    "the full potential of this method has yet to be realized .",
    "to date , we have analyzed the properties of 10 quasar host galaxies . with this sample ,",
    "we confirm that elliptical quasar hosts are distinguishable ( bluer ) from inactive ellipticals in rest frame _ b - v _ colour .",
    "additionally , we note a trend for radio luminous quasars to be located in redder host galaxies in comparison to their less radio luminous counterparts . however , general conclusions await further observations .",
    "currently we have 10 additional wiyn off - axis observations in the process of being reduced .",
    "furthermore , time has been allotted on the wiyn telescope to increase our total analyzed sample size to @xmath22 objects .",
    "this sample will consist of roughly an equal number of rlqs and rqqs and allow for 1 ) more rigorous comparison to other studies due to the increase in sample size , 2 ) further verification of our technique with the targeting of l07 overlap objects ( specifically he 0914 - 0031 and he",
    "0956 - 0720 ) , 3 ) investigation of the trends found in our preliminary sample . in the near future ,",
    "the robert stobie spectrograph ( rss ) on the 11-m southern african large telescope ( salt ) will be employed in our ongoing observational campaign .",
    "this phase of the project will increase the observable sample by its location in the southern hemisphere and by allowing for higher redshift objects to be targeted ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "future work will build on the current model to analyze the narrow - line emission .",
    "this will provide insight into the star formation rate , the emission mechanism , the metallicity , and the stellar content ( e.g. see l07 ) .",
    "the accomplishment of this program will provide important observational constraints on luminous quasars .",
    "the authors would like to thank joseph miller , roberto cid fernandes , and laura trouille for insightful conversations on various aspects of this work .",
    "we are also in debt to amy barger for use of computing resources .",

    "<S> we confirm that elliptical quasar hosts are distinguishable ( bluer ) from inactive ellipticals in rest frame _ b - v _ colour . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we note a trend for radio luminous ( @xmath1 ) quasars to be located in redder host galaxies in comparison to their less luminous radio counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> while the host colour and age of our radio luminous sample is in close proximity to the green valley , our radio faint sample is consistent with quiescent star - forming galaxies . however , further observations are needed to confirm these results . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss future applications for our technique on a larger sample of objects being obtained via salt and wiyn telescope observing campaigns .    </S>",
