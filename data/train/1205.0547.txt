    "the sfrs derived from @xmath29 alone exhibit a flat trend with stellar mass ( or even hints of less uv flux toward higher m@xmath0 ) , whereas sfrs derived from @xmath49 show a strong trend with m@xmath0 .",
    "the star formation - mass relation only materializes when dust attenuation is properly taken into account .    from figure",
    "[ fig : lirluv ] , we also see that the average rest - frame @xmath6@xmath7 color of star - forming galaxies becomes redder with increasing stellar mass ( and increasing @xmath5 ) .",
    "the red colors may be attributed to dust , although older stellar populations have similarly red colors .",
    "it is notoriously difficult to differentiate between subtle age and dust effects with a single color alone .",
    "however , because @xmath50 is independent of the rest - frame color measurements , we can isolate galaxies with red colors predominantly due to dust .",
    "the strong dependence of @xmath5 and the rest - frame @xmath6@xmath7 color on stellar mass raises the question of whether the star formation sequence can be `` resolved '' into distinct populations of star - forming galaxies .",
    "we first consider the following two samples at @xmath51 ( where we have a large number of galaxies at the high - mass end while maintaining a modest mass - completeness level ) : 1 ) blue star - forming galaxies with little dust obscuration ( @xmath52 , log@xmath53 ) , and 2 ) dusty red star - forming galaxies ( @xmath32 , log@xmath54 ) .",
    "when we select blue star - forming galaxies , similar to @xcite , the slope of the star formation sequence is close to unity and the observed scatter decreases to 0.25 dex ( left panel of figure  [ fig : selection ] ) .",
    "however , dusty red star - forming galaxies are an increasing fraction of the massive galaxy population toward @xmath42 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the middle panel of figure  [ fig : selection ] shows the star formation sequence for galaxies with red colors that we attribute to dust due to the high @xmath5 ratios .",
    "this population of galaxies has a similarly small observed scatter of 0.25 dex , but a shallower slope of @xmath55 .    while it has been shown that higher mass galaxies tend to have lower ssfrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , previous studies have not always distinguished between actively star - forming and passive stellar populations . here",
    ", we find that _ among _ actively star - forming galaxies , the star formation sequence for red dusty ( high - mass ) galaxies has a shallower slope , as compared to that for blue low - dust ( low - mass ) galaxies .",
    "this result implies that both massive quiescent and star - forming galaxies have lower ssfrs and hence older ages .",
    "we next consider the sample of star - forming galaxies with `` anomolous '' combinations of rest - frame color and @xmath5 ratios to determine where these galaxies lie in the sfr - m@xmath0 plane .",
    "we stress that we are not _ selecting _ these galaxies to be outliers in the log(sfr)-log(m@xmath0 ) plane , rather to be unusual in their observed color and dust properties .",
    "the galaxies with red rest - frame colors and low @xmath5 ratios fall in the lower envelope of the star formation sequence ( right panel of figure  [ fig : selection ] ) . these low ssfr galaxies may be in the process of shutting down star formation .",
    "similarly , we identify galaxies that have blue colors but high @xmath5 ratios .",
    "we find that dusty , blue galaxies have high ssfrs , predominantly residing in the upper envelope of the star formation sequence .",
    "this suggests that they are in a starburst phase and/or may have active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .    to search for signatures of agn",
    ", we match the nmbs catalogs within a 1 arcsecond radius to the x - ray point source catalogs from the aegis - x survey @xcite and the chandra cosmos survey @xcite . those galaxies with counterparts in the x - ray catalogs",
    "are indicated with open circles in figure  [ fig : selection ] .",
    "we find that the fraction of galaxies with x - ray detections is @xmath56 in all populations of star - forming galaxies , implying that the central black holes may become active at any stage of star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , x - ray detected galaxies tend to be outliers in the log(sfr)-log(m@xmath0 ) plane ( see figure  [ fig : selection ] ) , probably because a fraction of the 24@xmath16 m emission is not associated with star formation , as assumed .",
    "we find that the star formation sequence is not linear , with @xmath2 and a constant observed scatter of 0.34 dex .",
    "if we only select blue galaxies , however , we do find a linear relation , similar to @xcite .",
    "this selection removes red , dusty star - forming galaxies at the high mass end , which have a shallower slope .",
    "we note that @xcite also find a slope close to unity at @xmath12 , however this may be a result of the `` bzk '' selection . here",
    ", we are able to analyze the star formation sequence with a mass - complete sample of galaxies .    by accounting for the ratio of @xmath5 ( a proxy for dust ) and the rest - frame @xmath6@xmath7 colors of star - forming galaxies , we develop a simple picture that describes how galaxies populate the log(sfr)-log(m@xmath0 ) plane .",
    "we have identified four distinct populations : 1 ) quiescent galaxies ( 28% for @xmath57 at @xmath51 ) , 2 ) actively star - forming galaxies with `` normal '' colors and associated @xmath5 ratios ( 54% ) , 3 ) red star - forming galaxies with low @xmath5 ratios and low ssfrs ( 11% ) , and 4 ) blue star - forming galaxies with high @xmath5 ratios and ssfrs ( 7% ) .    among the galaxies that populate the `` normal '' star formation sequence , we see a continuous sequence of increasing levels of dust attenuation with increasing stellar mass and a decreasing slope in the log(sfr)-log(m@xmath0 )",
    "relation , implying decreasing ssfrs with stellar mass ( figure  [ fig : demo ] ) .",
    "@xcite observed similar trends across the sfr - m@xmath0 plane , where @xmath5 increases along the sequence and at a given m@xmath0 towards high sfrs .",
    "the dependence of ssfr on m@xmath0 appears to introduce a slight curvature to the star formation sequence",
    ". a power - law fit to _ all _ star - forming populations results in an observed scatter that is 0.09 dex larger than that of the `` normal '' sequence , with a significantly shallower slope of @xmath58 .",
    "we note that some models predict slopes that are too steep compared to the observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; it is possible that discrepancies between the inferred sfrs may be alleviated if the stellar imf is systematically weighted toward more high - mass star formation in rapidly star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "the observed scatter of the `` normal '' star formation sequence is 0.25 dex , which includes contributions from both random and systematic errors .",
    "we estimate the average random scatter by perturbing the 24@xmath16 m photometry and photometric redshifts within the @xmath36 error bars for 100 realizations , finding a small contribution of @xmath59 dex .",
    "additionally , about 0.08 dex scatter is introduced because the average sfr evolves within the redshift bin .",
    "finally , uncertainties in the conversion from 24@xmath16 m flux to @xmath50 introduce @xmath60 dex scatter @xcite , although we note that this value is quite uncertain ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in total",
    ", we estimate that random and systematic errors introduce 0.18 dex scatter to the star formation sequence , from which we estimate the intrinsic scatter to be 0.17 dex .",
    "semi - analytic models predict an even smaller scatter ( @xmath61 dex ) .",
    "however , the model scatter may be underestimated due to a simplified treatment of the halo mass accretion history .",
    "cosmological hydrodynamical simulations by @xcite find a scatter of up to 0.3 dex in the gas accretion rates on to galaxies in @xmath62 m@xmath41 haloes at @xmath17 .",
    "if this scatter translates linearly into scatter in the sfrs , this may reconcile the differences between the models and observed scatter .    to bolster the cartoon view presented in figure  [ fig : demo ] , we additionally consider the composite seds of normal star - forming galaxies in bins of stellar mass .",
    "due to the increasing levels of dust attenuation , we see a clear evolution of the composite seds in figure  [ fig : seds ] . on average ,",
    "the most massive star - forming galaxies have characteristically dusty spectral shapes , with a 2175  dust feature evident , whereas lower stellar mass galaxies have decreasing amounts of dust obscuration .",
    "we note that we see similar trends at higher and lower redshifts , but are unable to make robust statements due to incompleteness .",
    "we speculate that the small fraction of dusty , blue galaxies are mainly starbursts , as very few appear to be associated with x - ray sources .",
    "remarkably , we see that the spectral shapes of these galaxies are all very similar , irrespective of stellar mass ( upper right panel in figure  [ fig : seds ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the same physical process is dominating the stellar light , possibly a merger driven starburst .",
    "while 28% of galaxies with log(m@xmath63 have already quenched their star formation at @xmath9 , we find that 11% may be in the process of shutting down star formation .",
    "these galaxies have red colors and low @xmath5 ratios , occupying the lower envelope of the star formation sequence .",
    "we compare the composite seds of these red , low - dust star - forming galaxies to that of quiescent galaxies at the same stellar mass and redshift ( solid lines in bottom right panel of figure  [ fig : seds ] ) .",
    "these galaxies have similar rest - frame @xmath7@xmath30 colors to quiescent galaxies , but somewhat bluer rest - frame @xmath6@xmath7 colors , consistent with the idea that they are in the process of shutting down star formation and may soon migrate to the red sequence .    by studying four distinct populations of galaxies selected from the nmbs , we have demonstrated that quantifying the observed properties of the star formation sequence and how the sequence evolves with time requires a thorough understanding of the selection techniques and biases .",
    "a consequence of the strong dependence of dust attenuation on stellar mass is that measurements of the star formation sequence will depend critically on the sample selection .",
    "the gradual evolution we measure of the slope of the star formation sequence toward shallower values at high-@xmath64 is driven by the combination of the curvature of the `` normal '' star formation sequence and the evolution of the mass - completeness limits with redshift .",
    "an in - depth analysis of the physical properties of these galaxies and comparisons between the observations and models will help constrain the physical mechanism driving this potential curvature and the outliers from the star formation sequence .",
