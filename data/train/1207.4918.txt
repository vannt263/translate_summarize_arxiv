    "a well - established technique for unknotting a knot diagram is that of converting the diagram to an ascending or descending diagram .",
    "if a knot @xmath3 with c crossings has a bridge with b crossings , then we can convert @xmath3 into an ascending or descending diagram with less than equal to @xmath17 crossing changes since switching of all the descending(ascending ) crossings starting from the end(beginning ) of the bridge gives a totally ascending(descending ) diagram . in the case of torus knot @xmath12 given by the closure of @xmath18 ,",
