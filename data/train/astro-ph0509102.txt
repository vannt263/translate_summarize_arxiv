    "while the @xmath23cdm framework provides detailed predictions for the formation of dark matter structure , deep questions remain about the baryonic physics of galaxy formation . using statistical samples of galaxies , it is now possible to apply critical observational tests to numerical simulations and semi - analytic models of galaxy formation and evolution over almost 90% of the age of the universe .",
    "important tests include the determination of the global star - formation - rate and stellar - mass density as a function of redshift @xcite .",
    "evolution in the abundance of heavy elements in galaxies and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) provides an independent probe of the star - formation history of the universe @xcite , as the degree of metal enrichment reflects the integrated products of star - formation .",
    "the relationships among chemical enrichment , luminosity , and mass in galaxies as a function of redshift highlight the importance of star - formation feedback @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the degree of chemical enrichment in distant star - forming galaxies grants insight into how populations of high - redshift galaxies map onto samples in the local universe @xcite .",
    "chemical abundances therefore serve as a fundamental metric of the galaxy formation process .",
    "the rest - frame optical integrated spectra of star - forming galaxies contain several strong emission lines , including [ oii]@xmath24 , h@xmath1 , [ oiii]@xmath25 , h@xmath2 , [ nii]@xmath26 , and [ sii]@xmath27 .",
    "the relative strengths of these features indicate the physical conditions in the h  ii regions contained in the galaxies .",
    "one of the most important quantities derived from the relative emission line strengths is the average h  ii - region metallicity .",
    "both detailed photo - ionization models and empirical calibrations have been used to relate the ratios of strong emission lines to chemical abundances @xcite .",
    "locally , the metallicities of star - forming galaxies have recently been measured by @xcite , who use a sample of @xmath28 emission - line spectra of galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) to investigate the luminosity - metallicity and mass - metallicity relationships .",
    "this sample is two orders of magnitude larger than previously existing ones , and serves as a robust local comparison point for evolutionary studies . at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath29 ) , there are several different samples of star - forming galaxies with chemical abundances measurements , the largest of which is presented in @xcite , with @xmath30 galaxies at @xmath31 .",

    "are shifted to @xmath38 m , where bright sky lines and regions of strong atmospheric absorption cause much of the spectral real - estate to be unavailable .",
    "therefore , the precise [ oii ] redshifts provided by the deep2 survey are crucial for selecting objects whose h@xmath1 , [ oiii ] , h@xmath2 , and [ nii ] lines will fall at optimum wavelengths with respect to sky lines and atmospheric absorption .",

    "we therefore targeted two differential redshift windows within the larger deep2 redshift distribution : @xmath39 and @xmath60 . within these redshift windows , it is possible to measure all of the emission lines of interest in the near - ir . furthermore , we preferentially observed galaxies with the maximum number of emission lines free from contamination by bright sky oh lines , based on previously - determined [ oii ] redshifts .",
    "the pilot sample presented here contains 3 galaxies at @xmath61 and 9 galaxies at @xmath62 .",

    "we targeted a total of 12 deep2 galaxies , successfully measuring [ nii]@xmath41 and h@xmath2 for the entire sample , and [ oiii ] @xmath42 and h@xmath1 for 5 out of 12 . for the remaining seven objects without measured [ oiii ]  5007/h@xmath1 ratios , observations of those lines",

    "flux - calibrated nirspec spectra are shown in figures  [ fig : oiiihalphaspec ] and [ fig : onlyhalphaspec ] for our entire sample .",
    "we show spectra for objects with the full set of [ oiii ] , h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 , and [ nii ] emission lines in two nirspec filters , as well as for objects with single - filter observations of [ nii ] and h@xmath2 alone .",
    "@xmath74 and [ nii]@xmath41 emission line fluxes were determined by first fitting a one dimensional gaussian profile to the higher s / n @xmath74 feature to obtain the redshift and fwhm ( in wavelength ) .",
    "the @xmath74 redshift and fwhm were then used to constrain the fit to the [ nii ] emission line .",
    "this procedure is based on the assumption that the @xmath74 and [ nii ] lines have exactly the same redshift and fwhm , but that the @xmath74 line offers a higher s / n estimate of these parameters . the [ nii]@xmath75 line was too faint to measure for most of the objects in our sample .",
    "[ oiii]@xmath42 and h@xmath1 fluxes were determined with independent fits to the line centroids and widths . for most objects ,",
    "the h@xmath2 , [ oiii]@xmath42 , and h@xmath1 redshifts agree to within @xmath76 ( @xmath77  km  s@xmath78  at @xmath79 ) .    though",
    "not the focus of the current work , we mention in passing that 10 out of 12 of the h@xmath2 linewidths for our sample are resolved and range from @xmath80  km  s@xmath78  up to a maximum of @xmath81  km  s@xmath78 .",

    "while slit position angles were chosen for the purpose of targeting two objects simultaneously , regardless of the continuum or [ oii]-emission - line spatial extent or morphology , we find that three objects ( 32037003 , 32028085 , and 42055947 ) have spatially - extended and tilted emission - line profiles , indicative of rotation .",
    "since we do not have detailed morphological information for our sample , we do not further interpret the tilted emission lines with a model for disk rotation .",
    "the measured h@xmath2 fluxes range from @xmath83 to @xmath84 .",

    "uncorrected for dust extinction  of @xmath86 , using the calibration of @xcite .",

    "these characteristic h@xmath2 star - formation rates are discussed further in section  [ sec : bptphys ] .",
    "the close consistency between the flux calibrations from standard stars taken on the two separate nights of observations indicates that the standard stars were observed under photometric conditions .",
    "the variability of conditions throughout the two nights therefore translates into lower limits on the measured h@xmath2 line fluxes and associated star - formation rates when the standard star calibrations obtained during photometric conditions are applied to our galaxy observations . even in photometric conditions , there are several sources of systematic error affecting our absolute line flux measurements .",
    "these include imperfect centering of objects in the slit , variations in the quality of seeing , and light lost because of the mismatch between the slit width and the size of the deep2 targets , which are typically 05 in r - band ( rest - frame near - uv ) half - light radius .",
    "@xcite estimate that these sources of error amount to at least @xmath89% in absolute flux .",
    "for the remainder of the discussion , we therefore emphasize the measured line _",
    "ratios _ , [ nii ]  6584/h@xmath2 and [ oiii ]  5007/h@xmath1 , which should be unaffected by uncertainties in flux - calibration or the other systematics listed above . the uncertainty in these line ratios",
    "is dominated by random error at the level of @xmath90% .",
    "furthermore , since each line ratio is calculated from emission lines very closely spaced in wavelength , its value is independent of the magnitude of dust extinction . as shown in table  2 , the measured [ nii ]  6584/h@xmath2 ratios range from @xmath91 , with an average of @xmath92~6584/h}\\alpha \\rangle = 0.25 $ ] .",
    "for the five galaxies with measured [ oiii]@xmath42 and h@xmath1 fluxes , the average [ oiii ]  5007/h@xmath1 ratio is @xmath93~5007/h}\\beta \\rangle = 2.2 $ ] , ranging from @xmath94 .",
    "the average [ nii ]  6584/h@xmath2 ratio for these five galaxies is 0.24 , consistent with the average for the total sample of 12 .",
    "hereafter , we shall generally use `` [ nii]/h@xmath2 '' to refer to the measured ratio between [ nii]@xmath41 and h@xmath2 , and `` [ oiii]/h@xmath1 '' for the measured ratio between [ oiii]@xmath42 and h@xmath1 .",
    "in distant star - forming galaxies , measuring the relative strengths of strong emission lines is the only viable method for estimating the h  ii region gas - phase oxygen abundance @xcite .",
    "the lines typically used include some subset of [ oii ]  @xmath95 , h@xmath1 , [ oiii ]  @xmath96 , h@xmath2 , and [ nii ]  @xmath41 .",
    "empirical relations between strong - line ratios and chemical abundance have been calibrated using local h  ii regions with measured electron temperatures , and therefore direct abundance determinations @xcite .",
    "application of these relationships at high - redshift rests on the assumption that the integrated spectra of distant galaxies with high star - formation rates can be treated equivalently to the spectra of individual local h  ii regions used to calibrate the strong - line abundance indicators .",
    "we will return to this question in section  [ sec : bpt ] .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that a reasonably accurate estimate ( @xmath97 dex ) of the h  ii region oxygen abundance is possible with measurement of the `` @xmath3 '' ratio @xmath98 log(([oiii ] 5007/h@xmath1)/([nii ] 6584/h@xmath2 ) ) .",
    "one major benefit of this abundance indicator over , e.g. , the indicator r@xmath99  log(([oiii]+[oii])/h@xmath1 ) , is that @xmath3 is relatively independent of flux calibration and uncertainties in dust extinction , since it is derived from a pair of ratios of closely - spaced emission lines . with all of the systematic uncertainties in absolute line flux measurements described above , and including the variable photometric conditions that characterized our observing runs , the advantages of the @xmath3 indicator are significant . according to @xcite :    @xmath100    this relation holds for local h  ii regions with @xmath101 ( or , according to the @xmath3 calibration , @xmath102 ) , and arises from the fact that [ oiii]/h@xmath1 decreases with increasing metallicity , while , at least up to solar metallicity , [ nii]/h@xmath2 increases with increasing metal content .",
    "we derive oxygen abundances using the @xmath3 indicator for the five galaxies in our sample with [ oiii]/h@xmath1 and [ nii]/h@xmath2 measurements , as shown in table  2 .",
    "the average value of ( [ oiii]/h@xmath1)/([nii]/h@xmath2 ) implies an oxygen abundance of @xmath103 .",
    "this value corresponds to @xmath104 , when we compare with the solar value of @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "the three galaxies at @xmath62 have systematically lower @xmath3 values , corresponding to higher oxygen abundances , than the two galaxies at @xmath106 .",
    "however , since the two galaxies at @xmath61 are less luminous , the difference in average o / h between the two subsamples most likely reflects the fundamental correlation between metallicity and luminosity , rather than redshift evolution .",
    "a larger sample will be required to draw further inferences .",
    "using the same h  ii region calibration sample , @xcite show , in terms of @xmath107  log([nii ] 6584/h@xmath2 ) , that :    @xmath108    the scatter around this relation is @xmath109  dex . it is valid for h  ii regions spanning from @xmath110 ( or , according to the @xmath4 calibration , from @xmath111 ) . for the total sample of 12 galaxies , including those with only [ nii]/h@xmath2 , we calculate o / h based on the @xmath4 indicator alone . the results are listed in table  2 . as shown with detailed photoionization models",
    "@xcite , the @xmath4 indicator is not sensitive to increasing oxygen abundance above roughly solar metallicity , so is not an ideal metallicity indicator .",
    "however , as long as we use the same empirical quantities for samples at other redshifts , we can still use @xmath4 to obtain crude information from our total sample of 12 galaxies about the evolution of fundamental scaling relationships between star - forming galaxy luminosity and metallicity @xmath6 , and between mass and metallicity @xmath7 .",
    "the average value of [ nii]/h@xmath2 for the sample is 0.25 , implying an oxygen abundance of @xmath112 , which corresponds to @xmath113 . in our total sample , the three @xmath61 galaxies have systematically lower [ nii]/h@xmath2 ratios than the @xmath62 galaxies , but are also systematically fainter ",
    "consistent with the statistics in the smaller @xmath3 sample .",
    "comparing oxygen abundances derived from @xmath4 versus those derived from @xmath3 , for the five galaxies with both measurements , we find that the @xmath3-based oxygen abundances are systematically lower by @xmath114  dex .",
    "the difference is slightly larger for the three galaxies at @xmath62 , and may result from intrinsic differences in the h  ii region physical conditions in these galaxies .",
    "we will return to this point in section  [ sec : bpt ] .",
    "both star - forming and early - type galaxies in the local universe follow strong correlations between rest - frame optical luminosity and the degree of chemical enrichment @xcite .",
    "perhaps a more fundamental correlation is the one observed between stellar mass and metallicity . for star - forming galaxies ,",
    "these correlations have recently been measured over a factor of @xmath115 in stellar mass , 6 optical magnitudes and a factor of 10 in gas - phase oxygen abundance , using a sample of @xmath28 non - agn emission - line galaxies culled from the sdss @xcite .",
    "while the oxygen abundance increases fairly rapidly with increasing stellar mass at low mass , the relationship flattens at stellar masses of @xmath116 and above .",
    "@xcite interpret this result as evidence for galactic winds depleting the metal content of galaxies below a critical mass of @xmath116 , thereby lowering the associated effective yield .",
    "the effect of outflows , commonly referred to as  star - formation feedback , \" is a crucial input to models of galaxy formation and may be required as a fairly generic ingredient in order to explain a wide range of observed phenomena , including the observed angular momentum in disk galaxies , the metal content in the igm , the global stellar content in the local universe , and the amount of entropy in clusters .",
    "measurement of the redshift evolution in the observed relationships among metallicity , luminosity , and stellar mass will provide powerful constraints on models of galaxy formation , and , in particular , star formation feedback .",
    "we now construct the relationships among oxygen abundance , absolute @xmath12-magnitude , and stellar mass for our sample of deep2 galaxies , and compare with analogous relationships determined at lower redshift .",
    "since there is considerable scatter among the calibrations of commonly used oxygen abundance indicators , a fair comparison of galaxy samples at different redshifts must be based on the same empirical strong - line indicator , using the same calibration . for a uniform comparison with the @xmath13 deep2 sample",

    "the probabilities are marginalized across the grid and binned by stellar mass , yielding a stellar mass probability distribution .",
    "we adopt the median and standard deviation of this distribution as the estimated stellar mass and uncertainty , respectively . to measure evolution in the relationship between mass and metallicity",

    "the average fractional stellar mass difference is @xmath130 .",
    "the scatter in the average stellar mass difference amounts to a little less than a factor of two , smaller than any of the evolutionary differences we report below .",
    "more importantly , though , there is no significant systematic difference in the two techniques used to model stellar masses .",

    "regardless of the indicator used , deep2 galaxies at @xmath13 are several magnitudes brighter than @xmath137 sdss galaxies at fixed o / h . for a more meaningful comparison with sdss galaxies , we use the subsample of deep2 galaxies with @xmath3-based abundances .",
    "these galaxies have @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "sdss galaxies with comparable @xmath140 have @xmath141 , 5.2 magnitudes fainter !",
    "sdss galaxies with comparable @xmath16 to the average of the deep2 sample have @xmath142 , 0.35 dex higher .",
    "now we turn to the question of stellar mass . the deep2 sample with @xmath3 measurements have @xmath143 .",
    "sdss galaxies with comparable @xmath140 have @xmath144 .",
    "sdss galaxies with comparable stellar mass to the average of the deep2 sample have @xmath145 .",
    "while sdss contains a significant fraction of galaxies with higher masses than the average among the deep2 sample , the inferred o / h does not significantly increase at stellar masses larger than @xmath146 .",
    "the flattening in the mass - metallicity relationship at high stellar mass reflects the physical properties of the galaxies @xcite , though the absolute value of o / h at which the trend flattens differs depending on which abundance indicator is used .",
    "according to the abundance scale adopted in @xcite , the local m - z relationship flattens at @xmath147 , whereas the @xmath3-based scale indicates flattening at @xmath148 .",
    "this difference reflects the magnitude of systematic uncertainties among various strong - line calibrations in the high - metallicity regime .",
    "several groups have considered the evolution of the @xmath117 relationship at @xmath149 , primarily based on @xmath150-based oxygen abundances .",
    "the largest sample of intermediate redshift galaxies with oxygen abundance measurements is contained in @xcite , with 204 emission - line galaxies at @xmath151 drawn from the team keck redshift survey ( tkrs ) . of these ,",
    "38 galaxies with @xmath152 have both [ oiii]/h@xmath1 and [ nii]/h@xmath2 measurements , allowing a direct comparison with our deep2 sample .",
    "the tkrs subsample with [ nii]/h@xmath2 measurements is roughly equidistant in lookback time between the sdss and deep2 samples , and contains @xmath16 values at fixed o / h that are intermediate between those of our deep2 sample and sdss galaxies .",
    "specifically , galaxies in the @xmath153 tkrs subsample with @xmath154 have @xmath155 .",
    "using @xmath150 for the total tkrs sample at @xmath156 , @xcite find that the intermediate - redshift galaxies are @xmath157 magnitudes more luminous at a given metallicity than their local counterparts .",
    "the evolution in the @xmath117 relationship at intermediate redshift is not resolved at the very luminous end , however , as both @xcite and @xcite find little difference in the average metallicities of the most luminous ( @xmath158 ) galaxies in their samples  even at @xmath159  relative to local counterparts .",
    "larger samples at both intermediate redshift and @xmath44 will help resolve this ambiguity .",
    "for now , though , we focus on the consistent picture of evolution provided by our deep2 sample , the tkrs galaxies with [ nii]/h@xmath2 measurements , and the sdss emission - line sample .      in order to explain the evolution in the @xmath117 and @xmath118 relationships observed for deep2 galaxies at @xmath44 and sdss galaxies at @xmath160 , we make two key assumptions .",
    "first , we assume that the descendants of the deep2 galaxies with abundance measurements will be forming stars at @xmath161 .",
    "accordingly , they should be included in the emission - line sample of @xcite , and follow the @xmath117 and @xmath118 relationships observed among sdss galaxies .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption , based on the clustering strength of blue deep2 galaxies with similar spectral and photometric properties .",
    "@xcite find that deep2 galaxies with strong emission lines and also those with blue rest - frame optical colors have correlation lengths of @xmath162 comoving mpc .",
    "the local descendants of the dark matter halos hosting such galaxies will cluster more like blue , emission - line galaxies in the @xcite sdss sample , rather than red , absorption - dominated galaxies @xcite . also , based on the relative evolution of the rest - frame @xmath12-band luminosity functions of red and blue galaxies between @xmath13 and @xmath14 , it is reasonable to assume that a significant fraction of the blue deep2 galaxies will remain blue @xcite .",
    "second , we assume that deep2 galaxies fade on average by @xmath163  mags between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this degree of fading reflects the observed evolution of @xmath164 in both blue and red galaxy luminosity functions traced to @xmath44 by the deep2 and combo-17 surveys @xcite .",
    "following these two assumptions , we shift the deep2 sample in luminosity by an amount that reflects the average evolution @xmath164 between @xmath13 and @xmath165 , @xmath166  mag .",
    "this shift implies @xmath167 at @xmath14 for the deep2 galaxy descendants . in order for these local counterparts to lie on the local @xmath117 relationship",
    ", the sample average oxygen abundance must increase by 0.35  dex to @xmath168 .",
    "sdss galaxies with @xmath169 have average stellar masses of @xmath170 , twice the average stellar mass of our deep2 sample .",
    "therefore , these possible deep2 descendants have stellar @xmath18 ratios a factor of @xmath17 higher on average than those at @xmath13 .",
    "it is instructive to compare the concurrent increases in o / h and stellar mass , described above , with the predictions of chemical evolution models . according to a simple `` closed box '' model of chemical evolution ,",
    "the increase in gas - phase metallicity is governed by the fraction of gas that has been converted into stars , and the yield of metals returned to the ism by each generation of stars ( under the assumption of instantaneous recycling ) .",
    "the model is described by the equation :    @xmath171    where @xmath172 is the mass fraction of metals in the ism , @xmath173 is the metal yield by mass , and @xmath174 is the fraction of the total baryonic mass remaining in gas that has not yet been converted into stars . predicting the increase in stellar mass for a given increase in o / h",
    "requires an estimate of the yield of oxygen .",
    "based on the solar neighborhood value of @xmath175 , and with oxygen comprising @xmath176% of the mass in metals , past estimates of the oxygen yield by mass were @xmath177 @xcite .",
    "new measurements of the solar abundance may indicate that @xmath178 is actually @xmath179 dex lower . in an independent manner ,",
    "both @xcite and @xcite compute the `` effective yield '' , @xmath180 , for star - forming galaxies as a function of mass .",
    "the quantity @xmath180 is defined as the oxygen abundance divided by @xmath181 .",
    "both authors find that @xmath180 asymptotes at large galaxy masses to a value of @xmath182 , which is considered the true yield .",
    "however , the value of @xmath178 derived by both @xcite and @xcite is derived from o / h values based on the sdss or @xmath150 abundance scales , both of which yield systematically higher values than @xmath3 calibration . with the @xmath3 calibration",
    ", the value of the true yield could easily be lower by @xmath183 dex .    given the uncertainty in @xmath178 , which could range between @xmath184 and @xmath185 , we would predict an increase in stellar mass of a factor of @xmath186 to accompany the increase in metallicity of deep2 galaxies between @xmath13 and @xmath14 , if the systems are treated as closed boxes .",
    "therefore , the observed increase in stellar mass of roughly a factor of two is consistent with expectations of closed box chemical evolution models , for an increase in average oxygen abundance from @xmath187 to 8.75 .",
    "approximate closed boxes may not be such unrealistic descriptions of these galaxies , at least in terms of the importance of outflows .",
    "the likely sdss descendants of the deep2 galaxies have effective yields , derived by @xcite , that are within only @xmath188  dex of the true yield , which is interpreted as an indication that the effect of supernova feedback can not be significant on the progress of enrichment in these galaxies .",
    "[ nii]/h@xmath2 ratios have also been measured for star - forming galaxies at @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "measurements for individual galaxies are available for @xmath21 objects with @xmath189 , the most luminous @xmath190% ( in the rest - frame optical ) of uv - selected galaxies in this redshift range @xcite .",
    "[ nii]/h@xmath2 can be measured from composite near - ir spectra of fainter galaxies in the sample as well . as shown by the open star in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : lzmz ] , representing the average @xmath140 , @xmath16 , and @xmath191 for the sample of 7 @xmath189 @xmath21 galaxies in @xcite , the average @xmath16 and o / h values for the sample are very similar to those of the deep2 sample .",
    "furthermore , @xcite show preliminary evidence for an @xmath117 relationship among @xmath21 star - forming galaxies , by demonstrating that the [ nii]/h@xmath2 ratio is smaller in a composite spectrum of a sample of @xmath21 galaxies with fainter rest - frame optical luminosities @xcite . despite similar locations in the @xmath117 plane , the @xmath21 galaxies in @xcite will follow significantly different evolutionary paths relative to those of our deep2 sample .",
    "specifically , the @xmath21 sample will not be forming stars by @xmath14 , therefore their local descendants will not be found among the sample of @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is likely that they will no longer be forming stars even by @xmath13 , and will be found among the red , absorption - line galaxies in the deep2 survey .",
    "this scenario is supported by multiple pieces of evidence .",
    "first , the average stellar mass and @xmath18 ratio among the higher - redshift @xcite sample is already @xmath192 times higher than that of the deep2 sample average .",
    "this difference is shown graphically by the the location of the star symbol in figure  [ fig : lzmz ] , representing the average of the @xmath21 sample .",
    "while this point lies squarely in the middle of the distribution of deep2 @xmath16 values ( left - hand panel ) , it is found towards the high - mass extreme of the deep2 stellar mass values ( right - hand panel ) .",
    "@xmath18 ratios will generally tend to increase with time , barring the presence of a major later episode of star - formation .",
    "only one galaxy in our deep2 @xmath4 sample has a stellar @xmath18 greater than those in the @xmath21 comparison sample , and may serve as a @xmath193 counterpart .",
    "the sed of this one object , 32025514 , indicates the highest stellar mass in the total sample of 12 deep2 galaxies , and a significantly more mature stellar population as traced empirically by the largest @xmath194 color ( rest - frame uv - to - optical break ) .",
    "in contrast to most of the galaxies in our deep2 sample , 32025514 may follow an evolutionary path between @xmath13 and @xmath14 resulting in a local descendent with no ongoing star formation . in the future",
    ", it will be valuable to compare the deep2 sample with a more representative sample of @xmath21 objects , spanning a larger dynamic range in stellar mass and @xmath18 ( erb et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "another clue about the evolution of galaxies in the @xcite sample is based the large clustering strength of uv - selected galaxies at @xmath21 .",
    "the correlation length among the total @xmath21 sample is @xmath195 comoving mpc , and among galaxies with @xmath196 , it increases to @xmath197 comoving mpc @xcite .",
    "a comparison with simulations indicates that red , absorption - line dominated galaxies in the deep2 survey cluster as strongly as the @xmath13 descendants of the dark matter haloes hosting typical uv - selected galaxies at @xmath21 ; elliptical galaxies in the sdss cluster like the @xmath14 descendants of the same dark matter haloes @xcite . the correlations observed in @xmath21 star - forming galaxies among o / h , @xmath16 , and @xmath191 can therefore be used to understand the formation of elliptical galaxies .",
    "as the @xcite sample all have @xmath198 , their descendants at @xmath13 and @xmath14 should be more massive , more strongly clustered , and even less likely to be forming stars than the descendants of typical uv - selected @xmath21 galaxies .",
    "in figure  [ fig : o3n2 ] , [ oiii]/h@xmath1 and [ nii]/h@xmath2 ratios are plotted for the five galaxies with the full set of emission lines .",
    "this space serves as a fairly standard diagnostic for discriminating between star - forming galaxies and agn @xcite .",
    "also indicated in figure  [ fig : o3n2 ] are emission - line objects from the sdss survey , which trace out well - defined sequences .",
    "star - forming galaxies occupy the fan in the lower left - hand portion of the diagram , in a region roughly defined by decreasing excitation as a function of increasing metallicity .",
    "this physical sequence results in the empirical anti - correlation between [ oiii]/h@xmath1 and [ nii]/h@xmath2 up to the point where [ nii]/h@xmath2 saturates ( at [ nii]/h@xmath199 ) . at the highest metallicities ,",
    "[ oiii]/h@xmath1 continues to decrease at relatively fixed [ nii]/h@xmath2 .",

    ", @xcite successfully recovered the location and upper envelope of the [ oiii]/h@xmath1 vs. [ nii]/h@xmath2 emission - line sequence of local h  ii regions , which is observed among both the h  ii regions compiled by @xcite to generate the @xmath3 abundance calibration , and the emission - line galaxies in @xcite .",
    "two curves are plotted in figure  [ fig : o3n2 ] , of the same shape as the upper - envelope found by @xcite , though with different normalizations .",
    "these curves serve to discriminate between star - forming galaxies and agn .",
    "the more conservative , dashed curve is from @xcite , and is used to define the sample of star - forming galaxies presented in @xcite .",
    "this criterion should yield galaxies in which the h@xmath2 flux has @xmath204% contribution from agn @xcite .",
    "the upper dotted curve is from @xcite and represents a theoretical upper limit on the location of star - forming galaxies in the diagnostic diagram .",
    "it is very unlikely to find star - forming galaxies above the line of @xcite .",
    "we shall return to this limit in the discussion below .    while the two @xmath61 galaxies in our deep2 sample are roughly consistent with the sequence of sdss star - forming galaxies and local h  ii regions in terms of diagnostic line ratios , the three @xmath62 galaxies are significantly offset from this sequence .",
    "the difference between @xmath106 and @xmath62 galaxies more likely reflects the nearly disjoint ranges of rest - frame luminosity and star - formation rate probed by the small samples , rather than an evolutionary trend within deep2 .",
    "two of the @xmath62 galaxies , 42008627 and 42008219 , are offset towards higher [ oiii]/h@xmath1 by @xmath205  dex , relative to star - forming sdss galaxies with similar [ nii]/h@xmath2 ratios .",
    "the third galaxy , 42055947 , is offset by 0.3  dex , which is still significant .",
    "conversely , 42008627 and 42008219 are displaced by 0.4  dex towards higher [ nii]/h@xmath2 relative to sdss galaxies with similar [ oiii]/h@xmath1 ratios , while 42055947 is displaced by 0.2  dex . the line ratios of 42008627 and 42008219 place these objects in a region of the diagnostic diagram only sparsely populated by sdss emission - line galaxies , intermediate between local star - forming galaxies and agn , above the @xcite curve but below that of @xcite . in a preliminary sample of four uv - selected @xmath21 star - forming galaxies with the full set of emission - line measurements , offsets of equal or greater value relative to the emission - line sequence of local star - forming galaxies have been measured , and over a larger range in [ nii]/h@xmath2 ( erb et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the subset of the intermediate redshift tkrs sample @xcite with measured [ nii]/h@xmath2 ratios follows an emission - line sequence consistent with the sdss sequence over most of the range in [ nii]/h@xmath2 . at [ nii]/h@xmath206 , however , there are a few outlying tkrs galaxies with similar line ratios to those of the @xmath62 deep2 galaxies .",
    "one effect that could potentially bias the measured [ oiii]/h@xmath1 ratios towards higher values is the underestimate of h@xmath1 due to underlying stellar balmer absorption .",
    "stellar absorption will have less of an effect on h@xmath2 because of its larger emission line strength .",
    "the effect of stellar absorption was not included in the calculation of [ oiii]/h@xmath1 and [ nii]/h@xmath2 ratios in part because little or no continuum was detected .",
    "however , it is possible to place an upper limit on the importance of this effect for the @xmath62 galaxies with offset line ratios by using the @xmath207 upper limit on the continuum , @xmath208 , and a reasonable estimate of the stellar absorption equivalent width , @xmath209    @xcite .",
    "the upper limit on the amount by which the h@xmath1 flux must be corrected is then @xmath210 . with such corrections , the points for the @xmath62 deep2 galaxies would shift by no more than 0.1  dex downwards , and by an insignificant amount in [ nii]/h@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , unaccounted - for stellar balmer absorption is not the explanation for the offsets in emission line ratios . with the assumption that the offsets correspond to a difference in the intrinsic emission line properties of the deep2 galaxies , we consider possible causes and implications of this difference in the following discussion .",
    "first , it is worth placing the inferred star - formation rates of our deep2 sample in context with those of other distant star - forming galaxies , as well as typical sdss emission - line galaxies and intermediate - redshift tkrs galaxies .",
    "the three @xmath62 galaxies offset from the sdss emission - line diagnostic locus have inferred h@xmath2 star - formation rates ranging between @xmath211 , uncorrected for dust - extinction , while the two @xmath61 galaxies have star - formation rates of @xmath212 .",
    "@xcite found an average star - formation rate of @xmath213 for a sample of 14 @xmath214 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) .",
    "these star - formation rates were based on h@xmath1 emission fluxes , since h@xmath2 is shifted into the thermal infrared at @xmath214 . for a sample of 16 galaxies at @xmath215 , selected with criteria designed to find @xmath21 analogs to lbgs , @xcite found an average h@xmath2 star - formation rate of @xmath216 .",
    "the @xcite sample therefore features a comparable range of h@xmath2 star - formation rates to that of the @xmath217 deep2 galaxies .",
    "the average h@xmath2 star - formation rate in the sdss sample , based on the h@xmath2 fluxes and redshifts in the sample of @xcite , is @xmath218 ( the median is @xmath219 ) .",
    "we correct this value by the 24% median fraction of galaxy light in the sdss fiber apertures reported by @xcite , which translates into an aperture - corrected mean star - formation rate of @xmath220 ( and a median of @xmath221 ) .",
    "these values are almost an order of magnitude smaller than the star - formation rates probed by our deep2 sample at @xmath62 .",
    "furthermore , only 1.5% of the @xcite sample has aperture - corrected h@xmath2 star - formation rates above @xmath222 , in the range probed by our deep2 sample .",
    "we find that sdss galaxies with such high star - formation rates are indeed offset towards higher [ oiii]/h@xmath1 and [ nii]/h@xmath2 relative to the @xcite sample as a whole .",
    "the offset is not as significant as seen in our deep2 sample at @xmath62 , though , because , by definition , the @xcite sample only contains galaxies below and to the left of the @xcite curve to insure minimal contamination by agn . as a caveat , we mention that dust extinction typically amounts to a factor of @xmath223 correction for sdss h@xmath2 star - formation rates ; but , as no robust extinction correction was available for the deep2 galaxies , we refrain from correcting the sdss star - formation rates at this point . the @xmath224 tkrs sample with [ nii]/h@xmath2 measurements @xcite has an average star - formation rate of @xmath225 , based on h@xmath1 fluxes uncorrected for dust extinction .",
    "furthermore , the star - formation rates in this sample are rather modest , with all of them @xmath226 .    in summary ,",
    "the deep2 galaxies are hosting significantly more active levels of star - formation than the bulk of galaxies in the sdss sample of @xcite and the @xmath224 tkrs subsample of @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that their emission - line diagnostics more closely resemble those of the nearby luminous starbursts discussed below @xcite , and of actively star - forming galaxies at @xmath21 @xcite , rather than those of h  ii regions in more quiescent galaxies .",
    "we now consider possible causes of the offset in line ratios observed in distant star - forming galaxies .",
    "these include differences in the ionizing spectrum , ionization parameter , and h  ii region electron density , the effects of shock ionization , and contributions to the emission from an agn .",
    "an offset upwards and to the right of the local h  ii region emission - line sequence was previously found by @xcite for a sample of 157 local starburst galaxies selected by their warm infrared colors .",
    "the starbursts in the @xcite sample not accounted for by the upper envelope of the h  ii region emission - line sequence of @xcite are found in a similar location to the deep2 @xmath217 galaxies , in [ oiii]/h@xmath1 vs. [ nii]/h@xmath2 parameter space .",
    "@xcite find that no combination of ionization parameter and metallicity can account for all the objects in their sample , if a zero - age instantaneous burst of star formation is assumed for the input ionizing spectrum .",
    "they infer that a harder extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) ionizing spectrum in the @xmath227  rydberg range ( i.e. , between the h  i and he  ii ionization edges ) is required to explain the offset in line diagnostics .",
    "such an euv radiation field is obtained in @xcite by assuming pegase continuous star formation models with an age of 6  myr ( at which point an equilibrium is reached in the ionizing spectrum ) .",
    "these models include fairly hard wolf - rayet star spectra in the @xmath227   rydberg range , and the upper envelope of the associated ionization - parameter / metallicity grid is what forms the @xcite upper limit curve for starbursts in the [ oiii]/h@xmath1 vs. [ nii]/h@xmath2 space ( figure  [ fig : o3n2 ] ) . while the continuous pegase model can account for line ratios of the warm starbursts in @xcite as well as those of the @xmath62 deep2 galaxies , the wolf - rayet stellar atmospheres used by pegase to generate such a hard euv radiation field are not very realistic @xcite .",
    "therefore , this specific model may not represent the ultimate or only solution to the problem of the offset line ratios .",
    "for example , the spectral slope of the euv spectrum in the @xmath227  ryd range is also affected by the slope of the stellar imf .",
    "an imf slope flatter than the standard salpeter value of @xmath228 will result in a higher fraction of the most massive stars , with an accordingly harder ionizing spectrum @xcite . at present",
    ", we have no independent observational constraints on the slope of the high - mass stellar end of the imf in deep2 galaxies .",
    "there are other possible causes of the offset in the deep2 line ratios . as discussed above ,",
    "our sample of deep2 galaxies at @xmath62 hosts elevated levels of star formation , compared with average galaxies in the sdss emission - line sample of @xcite .",
    "ionization parameter and star - formation rate are not directly proportional  since ionization parameter indicates the ratio of densities of ionizing photons and electrons , it is related to the star - formation rate through a geometrical factor and through the electron density .",
    "however , elevated rates of star - formation do provide a larger reservoir of ionizing photons . in the sample of @xcite , where the inferred star - formation rates are even more extreme than in the deep2 sample , large measured [ oiii]/[oii ] line ratios indicate significantly higher ionization parameters than those observed in more quiescent samples @xcite .",
    "a robust extinction correction based on simultaneously - measured h@xmath2 and h@xmath1 fluxes would be required to estimate an extinction - corrected [ oiii]/[oii ] value and therefore an ionization parameter .",
    "our current data do not satisfy all of these requirements , but we will attempt to address the issue with future observations .",
    "furthermore , it will be possible to estimate the ionization parameters for the small sample of sdss galaxies found in the same region of [ oiii]/h@xmath1 vs. [ nii]/h@xmath2 space as the deep2 galaxies .",
    "another apparent physical difference between the deep2 star - forming galaxies and the sdss sample is found in terms of the typical h  ii region electron density . in the sdss sample of @xcite , the median [ sii]@xmath229/[sii]@xmath230 line ratio implies an electron density of @xmath231.  resolution , the more widely - spaced [ sii ] line ratio is preferable to the [ oii ] line ratio for measuring electron densities . ] since our nirspec spectra are not deep enough to detect [ sii ] for individual objects , we estimate electron densities for the five deep2 galaxies with @xmath3 values based on the density - sensitive [ oii]@xmath232/[oii]@xmath233 line ratio found in the deimos discovery spectra .",
    "while the deimos [ oii ] spectra have not been carefully flux - calibrated , the [ oii ] line ratios should be fairly insensitive to flux - calibration .",
    "we find that the median [ oii ] line ratio implies an electron density of @xmath234 , which is significantly higher than the typical value observed in sdss emission - line galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "the deep2 electron density is quite similar to the electron density found in nearby starbursts .",
    "@xcite report an average electron density of @xmath235 , based on [ sii ] line ratios for their sample of warm infrared starbursts .",
    "this value is consistent with other recent results for electron densities in starburst nuclear h  ii regions @xcite , though higher than observed in typical disk h  ii regions @xcite .",
    "higher electron densities in starburst nuclei result from the higher ambient interstellar pressures present in such environments @xcite . for fixed ionization parameter , metallicity , and input ionizing spectrum , the photo - ionization models presented in @xcite display a dependence on electron density .",
    "the dependence is in the sense that model grids with higher electron density have an upper envelope in the space of [ oiii]/h@xmath1 vs. [ nii]/h@xmath2 that is offset upwards and to the right , relative to model grids with lower electron density .",
    "therefore , the enhanced electron densities in environments hosting active star - formation may account for some of the differences in observed line ratios .",
    "the next possibility to consider is the effect of shocks on the emergent emission - line spectrum .",
    "given the high star - formation rates observed in the deep2 galaxies , such shock excitation might be produced by the combined effects of supernovae explosions and stellar winds that collectively result in the large - scale outflows observed in both local and distant starbursts @xcite .",
    "models for fast , radiative shocks by @xcite predict a range of [ oiii]/h@xmath1 and [ nii]/h@xmath2 line ratios that encompasses those observed for the @xmath62 deep2 galaxies . specifically ,",
    "the `` shock plus precursor '' model , with a shock velocity of @xmath236 km  s@xmath78 , reproduces the line ratios quite well . in this case ,",
    "optical emission lines originate both in hot gas that has already been shocked , as well as in a pre - shock h  ii region that is being ionized by the radiation field from the cooling shocked gas .",
    "such a shock ionization model also predicts [ sii]@xmath237/h@xmath238 and [ oi]@xmath239/h@xmath240 . we do not obtain significant detections of [ sii ] or [ oi ] in any individual spectra , but find [ sii]@xmath241/h@xmath242 when we average the spectra of the three deep2 @xmath243 galaxies . with the current depth of our observations",
    ", we can not rule out the contribution of shock ionization to the observed emission - line ratios .",
    "finally , we consider the contribution of an agn . @xcite",
    "considered a class of `` transition objects , '' with emission - line ratios intermediate between those of star - forming galaxies and agn .",
    "the emission - line ratios of the @xmath62 deep2 objects are similar to those of `` transition objects , '' which are explained by @xcite as liner / seyfert galaxies whose integrated spectra are diluted by the contributions from h  ii regions photoionzed by stars .",
    "currently , we have no information about the x - ray or radio emission properties of our deep2 sample , which might help to identify the presence of an agn",
    ". however , it will be valuable to measure diagnostic emission - line ratios for deep2 galaxies in the extended groth strip region , where such multi - wavelength data , and optical morphological information , are available .",
    "we defer a final analysis of the cause for the offset in diagnostic line ratios of deep2 galaxies until a statistical sample is assembled . a larger high - redshift sample will enable studies of how the diagnostic line ratios vary as functions of other galaxy properties .",
    "furthermore , more detailed examination of the small fraction of sdss galaxies with similar [ oiii]/h@xmath1 and [ nii]/h@xmath2 ratios should aid in interpreting the deep2 sample .",
    "we will compare additional spectral features , stellar population parameters , and morphological information available for such sdss galaxies , relative to those of the sdss galaxies with more typical line ratios .",
    "at this point , we highlight the implications of the observed offset in deep2 line ratios , relative to the excitation sequence of both sdss galaxies and the h  ii regions used to formulate the @xmath3 and @xmath4 abundance calibrators .      studies of chemical evolution using star - forming galaxies at @xmath44 rely on strong - line abundance indicators .",
    "most of the features of interest are shifted into the near - ir at these redshifts .",
    "it would be most desirable to measure simultaneously the full set of strong rest - frame optical emission lines that are available in spectra of nearby star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , because of the limits of current near - ir spectroscopic technology , atmospheric absorption , and ubiquitous and bright night sky emission lines , only a subset of h  ii region lines can typically be observed simultaneously in high - redshift galaxies . in light of these limitations , we have emphasized the @xmath4 and @xmath3 strong - line abundance indicators for the current work , especially since these indicators are fairly insensitive to uncertainties in dust - extinction and flux - calibration .",
    "these indicators may represent the optimal strong - line indicators available for high - redshift galaxies , using current ground - based instrumentation .    in section  [ sec : lzmz ] , we emphasized the importance of using the same empirical abundance indicator ( e.g. @xmath150 , @xmath3 , or @xmath4 ) for a fair comparison of galaxy samples at different redshifts .",
    "now , we provide an important caveat to this argument . when using an empirically - calibrated abundance indicator such as @xmath3 or @xmath4 for both local and distant galaxies , it is critical to take into account systematic differences in the h  ii region physical conditions as a function of redshift",
    ". specifically , the @xmath3 and @xmath4 indicators were calibrated by @xcite using a sample of h  ii regions with direct o / h abundance measurements .",
    "these h  ii regions apparently follow the same [ oiii]/h@xmath1 vs. [ nii]/h@xmath2 excitation sequence as the star - forming regions of emission - line galaxies in the sdss sample of @xcite .",
    "this similarity suggests that the two samples span the same range of h  ii region physical parameters , in terms of ionizing spectrum , ionization parameter and metallicity , and that the @xcite calibration should be valid for converting the @xmath3 values measured from sdss spectra into oxygen abundances . since @xmath62 deep2 galaxies are offset from the emission - line sequence of local h  ii regions and sdss galaxies , systematic biases may result when applying the @xmath3 calibration of @xcite to derive oxygen abundances from their spectra .",
    "we can further illustrate the problem in two ways .",
    "first , we compare @xmath4- and @xmath3-based abundances for the five galaxies in our deep2 sample with estimates of both quantities . as presented in section  [ sec : oh ] , the @xmath4-based abundances are all systematically higher than those based on @xmath3 . for the @xmath243 sample , the average offset is @xmath244 dex , whereas for the @xmath61 sample , the average offset is @xmath245 dex .",
    "this systematic difference is not hard to understand .",
    "since local h  ii regions form a roughly one - dimensional sequence in the space of [ oiii]/h@xmath1 vs. [ nii]/h@xmath2 , a given value of @xmath3 corresponds to a specific location on the one dimensional sequence , and therefore also determines the value of @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath4 and @xmath3 indicators should yield consistent oxygen abundances for local h  ii regions , since both indicators were calibrated on such a sample . since the deep2 galaxies are systematically offset from this one - dimensional sequence ,",
    "their @xmath3 values correspond to higher values of @xmath4 , than those of local h  ii regions with similar @xmath3 values .",
    "therefore , it is the incorrect assumption of the deep2 galaxies following the local h  ii region excitation sequence that leads to the systematic discrepancies between @xmath4- and @xmath3-based abundances .",
    "second , we use the theoretical models of @xcite to demonstrate the importance of applying the correct physical conditions to the interpretation of emission line spectra . while the pegase instantaneous models with @xmath246 appear to provide the correct input ionizing spectrum to explain the emission - line sequence of local h  ii regions @xcite , the continuous models with @xmath247 appear more appropriate for producing the emission - line ratios observed in nearby starbursts @xcite . while the absolute abundance calibration of both of these models may be systematically high in the super - solar regime @xcite , we are simply interested in relative effects here .",
    "we determine the difference in metallicity for models of fixed ionization parameter , but different ionizing spectrum , that produce the same emergent @xmath3 value .",
    "this metallicity difference will indicate the possible magnitude of error in abundance that results from application of the local h  ii region model to the spectrum of a starburst nucleus  if indeed the differences between the two emission - line sequences can be explained by this difference in ionizing spectrum . to produce the range of @xmath3 values observed in our sample , the instantaneous h  ii region models are typically @xmath248 times lower in metallicity than the continuous starburst models .",
    "both the systematic differences in @xmath3- and @xmath4-based oxygen abundances in deep2 galaxies , and the error in derived metallicity that results from using an inappropriate input ionizing spectrum , are within a factor of 2 .",
    "these errors in metallicity are smaller than or equal to the quoted uncertainties in the @xmath4 and @xmath3 abundance indicators , which result from the intrinsic scatter among the h  ii regions that were included in the calibrations @xcite . however ,",
    "if the relationship between o / h and @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 ) is systematically offset _ in the same sense in all distant star - forming galaxies _ from the scatter observed local h  ii regions , this should be taken into account when estimating the evolution of chemical abundances , the @xmath117 , and @xmath118 relationships as a function of redshift .",
    "our future goal is to determine the cause of the offset line ratios , and , if possible , to define a local calibration sample of h  ii regions with direct abundance measurements , that follows the same excitation sequence of the distant starburst galaxies .",
    "finally , galaxies with high star - formation rates were much more common at @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "physical differences in h  ii regions with extreme star - formation rates may have a profound impact on the star - formation process and stellar imf @xcite . therefore , to characterize the build - up of the stellar mass in the universe , we must have a full understanding of the physical conditions in star - forming regions in distant galaxies .",
    "we have presented the rest - frame optical spectra of a pilot sample of 12 deep2 galaxies at @xmath249 .",
    "these galaxies span almost three magnitudes in @xmath16 ( @xmath250 to @xmath9 ) , and are drawn from the set of galaxies blueward of the observed @xmath65 color bimodality found in the deep2 survey .",
    "they span a range of stellar mass from @xmath251 to @xmath252 .",
    "we have measured [ nii ] and h@xmath2 fluxes for the entire sample , and additional [ oiii ] and h@xmath1 fluxes for a subset of five objects .",
    "our principal conclusions include the following :    \\1 .",
    "the [ nii]/h@xmath2 line ratios for this sample indicate an average gas phase oxygen abundance of @xmath253 , with the application of the @xmath4 abundance calibration of @xcite . combining [ nii]/h@xmath2 and [ oiii]/h@xmath1 ratios for the 5 galaxies with all available measurements , we apply the @xmath3 abundance calibration of @xcite to obtain an average oxygen abundance of @xmath254 . for this subsample",
    "the @xmath3 indicator yields systematically lower oxygen abundances than the @xmath4 indicator , by @xmath114  dex .",
    "\\2 . considering the sample of [ nii]/h@xmath2 ratios , absolute @xmath12 magnitudes , and",
    "derived stellar masses , we find evidence that objects with brighter @xmath16 and larger @xmath191 also have larger [ nii]/h@xmath2 ratios on average , indicative of higher oxygen abundance .",
    "this result suggests that luminosity - metallicity and mass - metallicity relationships are already in place among star - forming galaxies at @xmath44 , but will require a larger sample to confirm .    \\3 .",
    "a comparison of deep2 galaxies with the local sdss star - forming sample of @xcite indicates strong evolution between @xmath14 and @xmath13 in the relationships among oxygen abundance , rest - frame @xmath12-band luminosity , and stellar mass .",
    "we highlight results for the subsample of deep2 galaxies with @xmath3 measurements , characterized by @xmath255 , @xmath256 , and @xmath257 . applying the @xmath3 abundance indicator consistently to both samples",
    ", we find that sdss galaxies with similar o / h to the deep2 sample average are @xmath258 magnitudes fainter and @xmath259 times less massive .",
    "conversely , sdss galaxies with similar luminosities to the average of the deep2 sample have o / h abundances that are 0.35  dex higher .",
    "sdss galaxies with similar masses to the deep2 average are characterized by o / h abundances 0.30  dex higher .",
    "the clustering strengths and number densities of blue deep2 galaxies with strong emission lines @xcite are consistent with a scenario in which the majoriy of our deep2 sample will remain blue and star - forming by @xmath14 . in this scenario , the descendants of our deep2 sample will be included in the sample of @xcite . to explain how the @xmath44 sample evolves to lie on the locally - observed luminosity - metallicity and mass - metallicity relationships , we use the observed evolution in @xmath260 in the rest - frame @xmath12-band luminosity function between @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this evolution consists of 1.3 magnitudes of fading for the deep2 galaxies , to an average magnitude of @xmath261 .",
    "sdss galaxies with @xmath262 have typical stellar masses of @xmath263 , a factor of two larger than in our deep2 sample , and stellar @xmath18 ratios @xmath17 times higher . to lie on the sdss @xmath117 relationship",
    ", the deep2 oxygen abundances must increase on average by 0.35 dex .",
    "the combined increase in stellar mass and metallicity is roughly consistent with the expectations of a closed - box chemical evolution model , which is not very surprising , since the masses of the deep2 galaxies are larger than the mass at which feedback appears to be important @xcite . though they have similar [ nii]/h@xmath2 ratios and rest - frame @xmath12 luminosities , the sample of @xmath21 star - forming galaxies with @xmath189 presented by @xcite will follow a very different evolutionary path from that of objects in our deep2 sample .",
    "these @xmath21 galaxies have stellar masses and @xmath18 ratios that are already @xmath192 times higher on average than the deep2 galaxies presented here , and are significantly more strongly clustered than blue deep2 galaxies in general .",
    "they will no longer be forming stars by @xmath13 , and their descendants will not be included in the sample of @xcite .",
    "we compute the standard emission - line diagnostic , [ oiii]/h@xmath1 vs. [ nii]/h@xmath2 , for the five deep2 galaxies for which such measurements are available .",
    "bright deep2 galaxies at @xmath62 are significantly offset from the tight excitation sequence followed by sdss star - forming galaxies and local h  ii regions .",
    "a similar offset is observed in both nearby starburst galaxies @xcite as well as star - forming galaxies at @xmath21 ( erb et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "these galaxies all feature elevated star - formation rates , relative to typical values in the sdss sample .",
    "in particular , the deep2 @xmath62 galaxies have h@xmath2 star - formation rates of @xmath264 .",
    "we consider several causes for the observed offset in line ratios , including differences in the ionizing spectrum , ionization parameter , and electron density ; and the effects of shocks and agn .",
    "differences in the h  ii region physical conditions must be taken into account when applying empirically - calibrated abundance indicators , such as @xmath4 and @xmath3 , to galaxy samples at different redshifts .",
    "our pilot sample of deep2 galaxies demonstrates the feasibility of chemical abundance studies at @xmath265 .",
    "we used long - slit spectroscopy on a ground - based 10-meter class telescope , with relatively short integration times in single near - ir bandpasses .",
    "new infrared spectrographs are now available on large telescopes featuring broader simultaneous wavelength coverage ( e.g. , the gemini near infrared spectrograph ) , and the availability of multi - object near - infrared spectrographs is imminent .",

    "<S> we present the results of near - infrared spectroscopic observations for a sample of 12 star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 , drawn from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey . </S>",
    "<S> h@xmath1 , [ oiii ] , h@xmath2 , and [ nii ] emission - line fluxes are measured for these galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> application of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 strong - line abundance indicators implies average gas - phase oxygen abundances of @xmath5% solar . </S>",
    "<S> we find preliminary evidence of luminosity - metallicity @xmath6 and mass - metallicity @xmath7 relationships within our sample , which spans from @xmath8 to @xmath9 in rest - frame optical luminosity , and from @xmath10 to @xmath11 in stellar mass . at fixed oxygen abundance , </S>",
    "<S> these relationships are displaced from the local ones by several magnitudes towards brighter absolute @xmath12-band luminosity and more than an order of magnitude towards larger stellar mass . </S>",
    "<S> if individual deep2 galaxies in our sample follow the observed global evolution in the @xmath12-band luminosity function of blue galaxies between @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite , they will fade on average by @xmath15 magnitudes in @xmath16 . to fall on local @xmath6 and @xmath7 relationships </S>",
    "<S> , these galaxies must increase by a factor of @xmath17 in @xmath18 between @xmath13 and @xmath19 , and by factor of two in both stellar mass and metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> such concurrent increases in stellar mass and metallicity are consistent with the expectations of a `` closed - box '' chemical evolution model , in which the effects of feedback and large - scale outflows are not important . </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath20 @xmath21 star - forming galaxies have similar [ nii]/ha ratios and rest - frame optical luminosities to those of the deep2 galaxies presented here , their higher @xmath18 ratios and clustering strengths indicate that they will experience different evolutionary paths to @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , emission line diagnostic ratios indicate that the @xmath22 deep2 galaxies in our sample are significantly offset from the excitation sequence observed in nearby h  ii regions and sdss emission - line galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this offset implies that physical conditions are different in the h  ii regions of distant galaxies hosting intense star formation , and may affect the chemical abundances derived from strong - line ratios for such objects . </S>"
