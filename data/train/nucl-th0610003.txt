    "effective field theory is supposed to be an approach which can ultimately reproduce a fundamental theory and hence in principle can enable one to compute systematically corrections to approximate calculations . in nuclear physics we are supposed to have a fundamental theory , say , qcd , and so the task is to set up the scheme which comes closest to the truth encoded in qcd .",
    "there is the obvious question as to whether nuclear physics can indeed be understood in terms of qcd or put differently , how to test qcd in nuclear physics . by now",
    "this question has become akin to asking whether condensed matter systems can be understood in terms of qed . in this article , we adopt weinberg s  folk theorem \"  @xcite   mesons , that is , @xmath0 mesons with energy less than about @xmath1 mev . the use of effective quantum field theories has been extended more recently to nuclear physics where although nucleons are not soft they never get far from their mass shell , and for that reason can be also treated by similar methods as the soft pions .",
    "nuclear physicists have adopted this point of view , and i gather that they are happy about using this new language because it allows one to show in a fairly convincing way that _ what they ve been doing all along ( using two - body potentials only , including one - pion exchange and a hard core ) is the correct first step in a consistent approximation scheme _ .... \" ] and eschew this issue entirely .",
    "so what is the task of an effective field theory in nuclear physics ?    in addressing this question , there are two possible philosophical attitudes to take .",
    "one is to set up a well - defined effective theory within a very restricted domain of applicability , say , in energy / momentum or in the number of nucleons involved in the system and investigate whether and how the intended theory does what it is supposed to do .",
    "here one has a well - defined set of rules for calculations and then follow @xmath2 the rules and confirm that the strategy works .",
    "we shall call this  rigorous eft \" ( rigeft in short ) . in this approach ,",
    "given the strong constraint imposed by the consistency with the strict chiral counting and the rapid increase of input parameters at higher orders , one is mostly limited to low orders of chiral perturbation expansion , and trying to explain the complex dynamics of wide - ranging nuclear systems is not presently feasible .",
    "in the same class of approach is what we might call  toy eft \" where an eft with the least complexity taken into account is solved fully consistently with the set of rules adopted .",
    "the  pionless eft \" ( @xmath3eft ) to be described below belongs to this subclass .",
    "the other philosophy  which in some sense is drastically different from the @xmath3eft  is , following weinberg s theorem , to take it for granted that eft should work in nuclear physics and exploit the power of eft to make calculations that can not be accessed solely by the standard many - body technique which has been developed since many decades .",
    "this is a more physical approach aiming at describing nuclear phenomena more widely than rigeft .",
    "we shall call this ",
    "more effective effective theory \" ( meeft ) to suggest that it exploits both the power of eft and the precision of the standard nuclear physics approach ( snpa in short ) .",
    "the standard approach to physics of finite nuclei and normal nuclear matter has been to determine first highly sophisticated phenomenological two - nucleon potentials implemented with multi - nucleon ( typically three - nucleon ) potentials fit to a large body of experimental data and solve the many - body problem as accurately as possible .",
    "this approach , on a microscopic level , has reached an impressively precise description of nuclei up to mass number @xmath4 @xcite with ground and excited state energies within @xmath5 - 2% and on a more macroscopical level , to heavy nuclei .",
    "the solution requires massive numerical computations , which some think render the approach inferior to or less elegant than analytical approaches .",
    "but in the present era of computer revolution , that is not a valid objection as it does not make the work any less fundamental than analytical calculations .",
    "this approach which we shall call  standard nuclear physics approach ( snpa ) \" exploits two - nucleon potentials that fit scattering data up to momenta @xmath6 mev with a @xmath7/datum @xmath8 .",
    "the success of this approach has been extensively reviewed in @xcite and we will not elaborate any further on the snpa per se , although we will refer to it throughout this chapter . _ it should be stressed that it would be a grave mistake to ignore the accuracy achieved by the snpa and discard it as is done in some circle of workers in the field on the ground that it is not derived in eft formalism .",
    "our point of view which we will develop here is that we should  and can  incorporate it in the framework of an eft in such as way as to allow us to systematically control possible corrections brought in by more fundamental and systematic formulation .",
    "_      in assessing both the power and the limitation of the snpa , the physical observables to look at are not only the spectra of the states involved but also response functions involving wave functions and currents . for the latter ,",
    "the standard procedure that has been mostly employed is to write down the currents in terms of the single - particle operators  called impulse approximation  which are typically the most important and then make , often less important , corrections due to the presence of multi - body operators constructed from the exchange of mesons , called  meson - exchange currents , \" in an effective phenomenological lagrangian field theory .",
    "this approach was first systematized in @xcite . in many of the applications",
    ", this approach gives results that compare well with experiments .",
    "but within the framework of many - body theory based on phenomenological potentials , however , there is no unique or systematic way to assess what the size of corrections is , so when the calculated value disagrees with experiments , there is no well - defined and systematic way to improve the calculation .",
    "one is thus allowed to make post - dictions but rarely _ predictions _ or calculations that are free of free parameters .",
    "this is one place where eft can come in to help .",
    "what is the true use of an eft ? to show that qcd works is not the objective as mentioned above in accordance with weinberg s folk theorem .",
    "in essence qcd should work in nuclei if one works hard enough .",
    "this we are witnessing in the construction of two - body potentials in @xmath9pt .",
    "lo chiral perturbation calculation of the two - body potential fits the 1999 data base @xmath10 scattering below 290 mev with a @xmath7/datum=1.10 while the sophisticated phenomenological potentia av18 fits it with @xmath7/datum=1.04 . to see how high - order @xmath9pt terms work ,",
    "one can compare the @xmath7/datum=36.2 and 10.1 respectively for nlo and nnlo . at present , the @xmath11lo calculation is the best one can do and it is highly unlikely that the snpa potential be superseded by high - order chiral perturbation . ] what have been done in the literature in the past in addressing the issue in question are the following :    one direction belonging to the rigeft class followed by a large number of workers in the field is to limit oneself to a well - defined , but drastically simplified , eft lagrangian and then study this as rigorously as possible within the framework of suitably well - defined rules . a case that has been widely studied",
    "is the so - called  pionless ( @xmath3 ) \" lagrangian approach in which @xmath12 but nucleon fields are integrated out ( e.g. , @xcite and for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "covering by fiat a limited range of nuclear interactions , it is necessarily limited in scope and so far achieved no more than @xmath13 what is already well and accurately described in snpa . while this approach has the advantage to directly address problems that can lead to exact statements , such as the phenomenon of renormalization - group limit cycle , efimov effect etc .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , it lacks predictiveness that one would hope for .",
    "an approach that belongs to the rigeft class but comes closer in principle to the meeft class takes the nucleon and the pion as the relevant degrees of freedom and calculate to as high an order as feasible and as consistently as possible within the tenet of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "this calculation is limited in that the number of unknown constants increases rapidly as the chiral order increases .",
    "we will not have much to say on this approach in this article .",
    "but when we say rigeft without specification , we will mean both this and the pionless eft .    the other direction which we shall adopt in this paper as explained in detail elsewhere",
    "@xcite is to exploit the strategy of an eft to calculate quantities that neither the snpa nor qcd proper _ separately _ can do , that is , to make  predictions . \" by predictions , here , we mean parameter - free calculations with error estimates of what might be left out in the approximations , e.g. , the truncation , involved .",
    "the strategy is to exploit both the full machinery of snpa @xmath14 the power of eft in a scheme that is consistent with the symmetries of qcd in the spirit of weinberg s theorem to make @xmath15 that can be confronted with nature .",
    "we will tacitly assume that systematic high - order chiral perturbation calculations of the potentials will eventually provide quantitative support to the potentials used in the snpa .",
    "up to date , this assumption is justified as summarized in  @xcite .",
    "when applied to nuclear systems , an eft involves a hierarchy of scales in the interactions . in nuclear physics ,",
    "the nucleon is the core degree of freedom defining the system with the pion figuring as the lightest mesonic degree of freedom .",
    "what other degrees of freedom must enter in the dynamics depends upon what problem one is looking at .",
    "if the kinematics probed is of the scale @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the mass of the light - quark vector mesons , the lightest of which are the @xmath18 and the @xmath19 , then one may  integrate out \" all the vector mesons and work with the baryon and the pion only .",
    "this regime is accessible by a chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath9pt ) for physics of dilute nuclear systems , e.g. , few - nucleon systems . if one works to high enough order in chiral perturbation theory , one can hope to understand much of nuclear physics taking place within the given restricted kinematic domain , although in some cases , it is more convenient and simpler to introduce heavier degrees of freedom explicitly as for instance the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 etc .",
    "when one is studying systems involving a scale @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the pion mass , then one might even  integrate out \" the pion as well , as is done in @xmath3eft .",
    "how this program works is described in numerous lecture notes , one nice reference of which is @xcite .",
    "it should be remarked that even when @xmath3 eft is fully justified , that is , pions are @xmath24 indispensable , in certain cases , it proves to be much more powerful and predictive to keep pions as effective degrees of freedom .",
    "we will encounter such a situation when we discuss the so - called  chiral filter mechanism . \"",
    "one finds that having explicit pion degrees of freedom with their associated low - energy theorems can give a highly simplified and efficient description of a process which would require much harder work if the pion were integrated out .",
    "more significantly , the explicit presence of pions is now known to be the dominant element in describing the structure of light nuclei . in particular , to quote wiringa  @xcite ,  the success of the simple model [ of light nuclei ] supports the idea that the one - pion exchange is the dominant force controlling the structure of light nuclei ... \" nuclei with realistic interactions , the expectation value of the one - pion - exchange potential is typically 70 - 75% of the total potential energy .",
    "the importance of pion - exchange forces is even greater when on considers that much of the intermediate range attraction in the @xmath25 interaction can be attributed to uncorrelated two - pion exchange with the excitation of intermediate @xmath26 resonances .",
    "in addition , two - pion exchange between three nucleons is the leading term in @xmath27 interactions , which are required to get the empirical binding in light nuclei . in particular , the @xmath27 forces provide the extra binding required to stabilize the borromean nuclei @xmath28he and @xmath29be .",
    "\" it would seem therefore that integrating out the pion is like first throwing away the baby with the bathtub and then trying to recover the baby piece by piece . ]    as one probes denser systems such as nuclear matter and denser matter , due to br scaling ( recently reviewed @xcite ) , the vector meson mass drops and near chiral restoration , becomes comparable to the pion mass . in this case",
    ", one can not integrate out the vector mesons ; the vector fields have to be endowed with local gauge invariance , so that systematic chiral perturbation can be done with the vector mesons included @xcite .",
    "it has been recently discussed as to how hidden local symmetry emerges if one wants to  obtain \" an effective field theory from a fundamental theory .",
    "interestingly , a hidden local symmetry ( hls ) involving an infinite tower of gauge fields coupled to pions in a chirally symmetric way emerges from string theory via holographic duality .",
    "one refers to such a theory  holographic dual qcd . \"",
    "now one can view the hidden local symmetry approach of harada and yamawaki  @xcite with the light - quark vector mesons as a truncated version of the holographic dual qcd .",
    "restricted to the lowest members of the vector mesons , i.e. , the @xmath18 and @xmath19 , it is the wilsonian matching to qcd that makes the theory a bona - fide effective theory of qcd . in the simplest form of hls theory with @xmath30 , there are the octet pseudo - goldstone bosons and nonet of vector mesons coupled gauge invariantly .",
    "baryon fields do not figure explicitly .",
    "however holographic dual qcd suggests that baryons must appear as skyrmions .",
    "although there have been efforts to construct skyrmions with a chiral lagrangian with vector mesons incorporated ( see @xcite for references )  and it is now clear that vector mesons must be present in the skyrmion structure , very little is understood of such hidden local symmetry skyrmions . for the purpose of this section , instead of generating baryons as solitons , we will simply introduce baryon fields explicitly .",
    "baryon fields are to be treated as  matter \" fields , which is fine as long as the momentum transfer involved is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the cutoff .",
    "we generally consider baryons made up of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 quarks ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath36 although we will be concerned only with two flavors in this article  .",
    "we want the baryon field @xmath37 to be invariant under ( vector flavor ) @xmath38 , bvbv^ with @xmath39 .",

    ", the nucleon is non - relativistic , so it makes sense to go to the non - relativistic form of the lagrangian .",
    "in fact for the development of the principal thesis of this article , it is preferable . a nice way of going to the non - relativistic form is the heavy - baryon formalism  @xcite . to do this , define b_v ( x)=e^im_0 vvxb(x ) and introduce the spin operator @xmath52 that satisfies v_s_v^=0 ,  s_v^2 b_v=-34 b _ , and \\{s_v^,s_v^}=12(v^v^-^ ) , = i^ v_s_v . in terms of these definitions , we can rewrite @xmath53 as _ inv= & & |b_vv_d^b_v + 2d|b_v s_v^\\{a_,b_v } + & & + 2f|b_vs_v^+ in this form the mass term @xmath51 disappears , so the chiral counting comes out as we wanted without having to worry about the cancelation between the mass term and the time derivative on the baryon field .",

    "here we are interested in few- as well as many - nucleon systems . when there are more than one nucleon in the system , one has multi - nucleon terms involving @xmath54 fermion fields for @xmath55 .",

    ", we wo nt need vector degrees of freedom since their masses are of higher scale than the appropriate cutoff in the density regime we are considering .",
    "as mentioned , if one is interested in nuclear processes where the energy scale is much less than the pion mass , one may integrate out the pion as well .",
    "the resulting lagrangian containing only the massive nucleons has no chiral symmetry since there are no pions anymore .",
    "but chiral symmetry is not violated .",
    "it is just that chiral symmetry is an irrelevant symmetry here .",

    "it makes no sense to go to very high orders since unknown parameters increase rapidly .",
    "further complications can arise if one is interested in many - nucleon systems where the fermi momentum which is of order of a few times the pion mass enters but this theory makes no sense there anyway .    now what can we learn with this ?",
    "as already mentioned , actually little more than that an eft works for effective range theory .",
    "it can work for two - body and perhaps three - body systems for which the snpa has scored a great success already but the procedure gets rapidly unmanageable when it goes to the really interesting problem like the solar @xmath61 and the related @xmath62 process that involve four - body interactions .",
    "( we will return to this problem below . )",
    "it has no pions and hence quantities which are rendered easy to understand when pions are present ( various low - energy theorems .. ) are made difficult , if not impossible ( as we will see later ) .",
    "being a toy model , it allows systemization and completeness in describing certain but restricted low - energy processes thanks to the simplicity of the lagrangian .",
    "but it should be mentioned that the physical processes that can be treated are mostly , if not all , those which have been well reproduced since ages in snpa with well - defined corrections ( e.g. , those processes which are subsumed in effective range theory ) .    as an illustration ,",
    "consider @xmath63 at low energy which has been heralded as a success of the model @xcite and to which we will return below for meeft .",
    "the @xmath10 capture at thermal energy is accurately measured , and so can offer an excellent process to check the theory with .",
    "now this process is dominated by an isovector @xmath64 operator , so in ( [ pionless ] ) , we need the interaction @xmath65 term for the @xmath66 channel , a @xmath67 term for both @xmath66 and @xmath68 channels and the couplings to the magnetic photon ^1b_b = en^(_s + _ v_3 ) n and ^2b_b = el_1 ( n^t p_i n)^(n^t _ 3 n)b_i where @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",

    "but there is one unknown constant @xmath74 which can not be a priori fixed : there is no other experiment than the @xmath10 capture that involves this term and hence no true prediction can be made .",
    "it is not however totally devoid of value since once @xmath74 is fixed from the @xmath10 capture experiment , one can then turn the process around and calculate the inverse process @xmath75 as a function of the photon energy .",
    "it works fairly well up to , say , @xmath76 mev .",
    "this is relevant for big - bang nucleosynthesis  @xcite .",
    "one should however recognize that there is no real gain in theoretical understanding in this approach because the snpa can do just as well with well - defined two - body corrections .",
    "we now turn to a more predictive eft scheme . to exploit the accuracy and power of snpa",
    ", we adopt the weinberg counting rule . scattering@xcite which contains the core idea behind the application of chiral perturbation theory to nuclear problems .",
    "unfortunately the discussion in @xcite was incomplete because the role of nucleons in the counting was inadvertently left out .",
    "] in fact the weinberg counting@xcite is the only way that the snpa can be  married \" with an eft . since the aim here is to exploit the powers of both snpa and eft , we refer to this as  meeft ( more effective effective field theory ) . \"",
    "the weinberg counting consists essentially of two steps . in the first step",
    ", one defines the nuclear potential as the sum of 2-particle irreducible diagrams ",
    "irreducible in the sense that they contain no purely nucleonic intermediate states  and truncates the sum at some order @xmath77 in the standard chiral perturbation power counting . the potential is dominated by two - body irreducible terms with @xmath77-body terms with @xmath55 terms suppressed by the power counting . in the second step ,",
    "the potential so constructed is used to solve the lippman - schwinger or schrdinger equations .",
    "this corresponds to incorporating ",
    "reducible \" graphs that account for infrared enhancement ( or singularities ) associated with bound states etc .",
    "now the potential will then include one or more pion exchanges and local multi - fermion interactions that represent massive degrees of freedom ( such as the vector mesons @xmath18 , @xmath19 etc . )",
    "that are  integrated out . \"",
    "the approach can then be applied not only to few - nucleon processes but also to many - nucleon processes with the outputs in the form of physical observables , namely , scattering cross sections , energy spectra , response functions to external fields etc .",
    "wave functions make an indispensable part of the scheme , so the theory enables one to calculate things not only in few - body systems but also across the periodic table .",
    "contact with  rigorous \" eft  in the sense of power counting assured , e.g. , in pionless eft  can be made only for few - body systems .",
    "however systematic higher order chiral corrections to the estimates made in snpa can be made with certain error estimates for processes that involve heavy nuclei , e.g. , lead nuclei .",
    "this feat has not been feasible up to date in the @xmath3eft approach    the weinberg counting rule explains automatically that n - body forces with @xmath78 are suppressed relative to 2-body forces and n - body currents are normally subdominant to one - body current , known in nuclear physics as impulse approximation etc .",
    "these are familiar things in snpa but in meeft , they go beyond snpa in that one can in practice make a systematic account for corrections to the snpa results that are guided by an effective field theory strategy .",
    "what this means is that in calculating response functions to external fields , one can use the accurate state - of - the art wave functions that have been constructed since a long time in snpa to make  predictions \" that are otherwise not feasible in the rigeft approach .",
    "we will illustrate this point below .",
    "there is of course a price to pay for this  predictive power . \"",
    "one of them is possible ambiguity in the regularization procedure which separates high - energy and low - energy physics . where to do the separation is completely arbitrary and the observables calculated",
    "should not depend on the separation point .",
    "this is the statement of the renormalization group invariance .",
    "however to the extent that one calculates in certain approximation , one can not make the independence perfect .",
    "as it stands at present , how best to do this can be more an art than science .",
    "-3.5 cm    to cite a specific case , one of the ( counting ) problems arises when the two - loop graph with a pion exchange between two nucleons of fig .",
    "[ 2-loop - reg ] treated as a feynman diagram is calculated in dimensional regularization .",
    "the problem lies in treating this graph strictly in the sense of perturbation theory .",
    "we will see later that this is @xmath24 what is done in meeft .",
    "if one writes the dimension as @xmath79 where we want @xmath80 , then one finds that this graph diverges as ~ m_^2 .",
    "this represents the logarithmic dependence on scale @xmath81 .",
    "this scale dependence needs to be canceled by a counter term that goes like @xmath82 . in the power counting of the theory , this comes at higher order than that assigned to the pion exchange in weinberg counting since @xmath83 counts as @xmath84 .",
    "this means that when one solves schrdinger equation with the pion exchange included in the potential consisting of irreducible terms , one has an inconsistency in chiral counting since the pion exchange needs to be regulated by a counter term higher order in the weinberg counting .",
    "now how did this  basic \" problem not hamper development in snpa ?",
    "the answer is that what happens in nuclei is not wholly accessed by perturbative renormalization that is obstructed by the above problem .",
    "the fact that one is solving schrdinger equation illustrates that nuclear problems are inherently non - perturbative and the above inconsistency arises because one is doing a perturbation calculation .",
    "this difficulty is essentially sidestepped by meeft that we will discuss in the following section .",
    "there is also a possibility that this regularization difficulty can even be @xmath85 remedied  @xcite .",
    "one of the most serious is the singularity of tensor interactions in partial waves where the interaction is attractive . for large cutoff @xmath32 ,",
    "say , greater than vector meson mass , spurious bound states can be generated .",
    "of course the cutoff has a physical meaning in effective theories as elaborated further below and picking a cutoff bigger than what is appropriate is meaningless , so this problem is in a sense academic . however even for low enough cutoff",
    ", there may be unacceptably large cut - off dependence .",
    "the situation gets more serious in certain channels where counter terms are infrared - enhanced .",
    "however it turns out that one can add a counter term in each partial wave where this sensitivity is present and avoid this difficulty , at least to the leading order@xcite .",
    "it is not clear that this problem continues to arise at higher orders and more work is needed in this area .",
    "this issue is revisited in @xcite . at present , the meeft predictions described below are free from this difficulty .",
    "what is crucial for a viable meeft is to have very accurate wave functions .",
    "let us suppose that we do have wave functions that give a good description of spectra and response functions for a range of mass numbers .",
    "_ the basic requirement is that the wave functions so obtained possess the correct long - distance properties governed by chiral symmetry .",
    "_ we shall assume that the wave functions we use meet this requirement .",
    "it would be highly surprising if fitting a large number of low - energy data , both scattering and current matrix elements , can be achieved without a good account of the long - distance physics associated with chiral symmetry .",
    "we can therefore assume that the currents we construct in weinberg s scheme incorporating one or more pion exchanges given by leading order chiral expansion should be consistent with the ( snpa ) wave functions up to that order , with uncertainty in the current residing in higher order .",
    "shorter - distance properties of the range @xmath86 in the phenomenological potentials used to generate the wave functions are not unique , but they should not affect long wavelength probes we are interested in . if we can assure cutoff independence within a range consistent with the physics we are looking at , that should be good enough for a genuine prediction .",
    "one could use renormalization group arguments to support this statement .",
    "now the strategy in computing response functions is to calculate the irreducible contributions to the current vertex functions to the order that is correctly implemented in the wave functions from the point of view of chiral counting . in doing this , we can roughly separate into two classes of processes : those processes that are chiral - filter protected and those that are not .",
    "the former processes are accurately calculable given accurate wave functions with small error bars since the effects are primarily controlled by soft - pion theorems .",
    "the latter is less well controlled by low - energy theorems and hence brings in certain uncertainties .",
    "we will show however that with an astute implementation of snpa , one can calculate certain processes belonging to the second class with some accuracy .",
    "we will treat both classes below .",
    "we will be dealing with a slowly varying weak external field , with the external field acting only once at most .",
    "this means that in the chiral counting , the external field that does not bring in small parameters such as the external momentum or the pion mass lowers by one chiral order two - body corrections relative to the single - particle process to the counting that goes into the potential .",
    "this is essentially because of the minimal coupling of the external field which replaces one derivative in the two - body terms by the external field that contribute to the potential .",
    "this means that if we know the potential to @xmath77-th chiral order , then there can be a two - body current which , _ when not suppressed by symmetry _ , is determined to the same order , further corrections being suppressed by two chiral orders .",
    "this makes the calculation of the correction terms extremely accurate .",
    "this does not take place if the external field brings into the current operators extra small parameters such as the external momentum or the pion mass .",
    "it is known that this chiral filter is operative with the isovector @xmath64 and the axial - charge operators in nuclei@xcite , but not with the isoscalar @xmath64 and the gamow - teller operators as we will see later .",
    "the idea of chiral filter explained more precisely below was a guiding principle when eft formalism was not available for nuclear physics .",
    "in chiral perturbation theory , chiral filter is automatic , so there appears to be no big deal in it when one does a systematic chiral expansion to high enough order but the intuitive power associated with pion dynamics is completely lost when the pion is integrated out as in the pionless eft . an illustrative example is the thermal @xmath10 capture which can be predicted without any parameters in meeft but can only be postdicted with one unknown parameter in the pionless theory .",
    "the point is that even if it were possible to do a systematic chiral counting in @xmath3eft and obtain certain results perhaps painlessly , the simplicity brought in by chiral symmetry would be lost .      in order to illustrate how meeft supplemented by the chiral filter mechanism works out in nature ,",
    "let us study the response functions in the mass number @xmath87 system where we have at our disposal accurate wave functions for @xmath88 , @xmath87 and @xmath89 systems .",

    "all the processes in ( [ meeft ] ) have been treated in snpa but for reasons not difficult to pin - point , various calculations gave different results ranging in some cases over several orders of magnitude .",
    "the problem there was that there was no systematic way of estimating errors involved and making corrections .",
    "we will see how the chiral filter works in enabling one to make an accurate ( parameter - free ) prediction for the isovector transition in the @xmath10 capture and how it provides a way to compute the processes that are not protected by the chiral filter .",
    "the last of ( [ meeft]) the @xmath62 process  has not yet been fully calculated in the approach described in this paper .",
    "however the current is completely determined with the formalism described here and there is nothing to prevent a totally parameter - free calculation as we shall argue .",
    "historically it was the special role played by the pion that led to an early and simple understanding  @xcite of the thermal @xmath10 capture process in ( [ meeft ] ) .",
    "now we know that the chiral filter mechanism is automatically included in a systematic chiral expansion in meeft , so there is no big deal in it from the point of view of chiral symmetry but the power of it is in highlighting where and in which way pions can play a prominent role in certain processes , without requiring to go to higher orders in chiral expansion and in avoiding unknown parameters .",
    "it has the power to presage what one can or can not do with calculable leading corrections .",
    "this was first noticed in the application of current algebras , i.e. , soft - pion theorems , to the nuclear processes of the type given in ( [ meeft])@xcite and subsequently justified in @xmath9pt  @xcite . the argument went as follows .    in meeft ,",
    "effective currents are characterized by the number of nucleons involved in the transition .",
    "the leading one ( in the chiral counting ) is the single - particle opeerator ( called one - body or impulse ) , then the next subleading one is two - particle ( two - body ) followed by three - particle etc .",
    "the weinberg counting says that in the processes we are concerned with , we can limit ourselves to up to two - body .",
    "it has indeed been verified that three - body and higher - body corrections can be safely ignoredeft where @xmath77-body currents for all @xmath95 appear at the leading order . ] .",

    "in contrast , the leading order one - body current has the opposite behavior , namely , the space component of the one - body vector current and the time component of the one - body axial current are suppressed relative to the other components .",

    "the process is mediated by the em current which while dominated by isovector m1 operators , gets non - negligible contributions from isoscalar currents .",
    "this is because as in the @xmath61 process , the leading one - body operators are strongly suppressed by the pseudo - orthogonality of initial and final wave functions , making multi - body corrections become much more pronounced .",
    "in fact , one can make a rough estimate that the two - body corrections will dominate while three - body and four - body corrections are expected to be negligible and hence can be safely ignored within the accuracy we desire .",
    "this process presents a particularly significant case where two - body corrections are mandatory and are to be calculated with high accuracy .",
    "now as in the thermal @xmath10 capture , the two - body isovector m1 operator is dominated by the chiral - filter protected one - pion exchange graph .",
    "however since the single - particle term is suppressed , one would have to compute next order corrections to the two - body operator which come at n@xmath94lo relative to the two - body term . at that order ,",
    "one has a delta - function counter term analogous to the isoscalar @xmath116 encountered in the polarization observables in the @xmath10 capture discussed above .    furthermore unlike in the @xmath10 total capture cross section , isoscalar contributions can not be ignored for the @xmath62 cross section . here because of the same pseudo - orthogonality of the wave functions , the one - body isoscalar current is doubly suppressed , one by the small isoscalar nucleon magnetic moment and the other by the wave function mismatch .",
    "this means that a higher - order two - body isoscalar counter term analogous to the @xmath116 term needs to be accounted for .",
    "thus for a high - accuracy calculation , two contact term coefficients , one for the isovector term and the other for the isoscalar term , must be determined from given experiments .",
    "most fortunately , we have at our disposal two accurate experimental data , namely , the magnetic moments of @xmath117he and @xmath117h , that remove completely the dependence on free parameters .",
    "thus it is possible to make a genuine prediction that can be confronted by the presently available experimental results .",
    "% error bars .",
    "we expect that the theoretical error bar will be considerably smaller than this and hence the confrontation can be made a crucial test of the approach if the experimental error bars can be appreciably reduced . ] as observed in all cases discussed above , there would be a wide variation on the @xmath62 cross section depending on the cutoff values when the counter terms are not included but the dominance of the chiral - filter protected two - body correction in the isovector channel would make the calculated result much less sensitive to the cutoff than in the @xmath61 case when the contact terms are incorporated .",
    "the short - range two - body axial current proportional to @xmath111 in ( [ vanuft ] ) can intervene in an important way in different processes .",
    "it is a four - fermi axial current , so it couples to an axial field , internal or external .",
    "for instance , it can couple to the pion via pcac and this led grdestig and phillips  @xcite to suggest that one can get the three - body force that governs short - distance interaction as given by fig .",
    "[ 3-body ] .",
    "this will be able to pin down the three - body force with a fairly good accuracy .",
    "an example that involves external fields that we will discuss here is the process of the type nn nn where the pion involved is soft .",
    "this process  which is a two - body analog to the kroll - ruderman term in photo - pion production on a nucleon  can be used to extract reliably the neutron - neutron scattering length and here the @xmath111 term plays the same role as in the solar neutrino processes discussed above to assure a model independent meeft .",
    "it is an extremely interesting case that illustrates the power of meeft .",
    "-5.5 cm    it has been shown in @xcite that the uncertainty in the neutron - neutron scattering length can be reduced to @xmath118 fm .",
    "let us discuss how this comes about .",
    "data from radiative pion capture experiments ^- + dn+n+[pioncapture ] dominate the accepted value a_nn=-18.590.40  fm . now it turns out that @xmath119 fm out of @xmath120 fm in the error bar arises from the short - distance uncertainty and hence in order to reduce the error substantially below the @xmath119 fm , it is necessary to control the short - distance component of the force .",
    "it is here that the @xmath111 term accurately determined above can come in .",
    "the basic idea goes as follows  @xcite . for soft pion",
    ", the process ( [ pioncapture ] ) goes through the same current as the solar @xmath91 process ( apart from the coulomb interaction ) via pcac .",
    "the relevant lagrangian is of the form = -n^su n n^n .",
    "the coefficient @xmath121 here is , apart from a known constant , essentially the soft - pion limit of the coefficient @xmath111 , so the idea is to determine the coefficient @xmath121 for a given short - distance scale parameter which in the case of the @xmath91 process was the cutoff @xmath32 .",
    "then using the same prescription for short - distance treatment , one computes the capture process ( [ pioncapture ] ) using the @xmath121 in a suitable range of the short - distance cutoff parameter .",
    "the crucial idea is that an approximate renormalization group invariance ( in the wilsonian sense ) is achieved if within the reasonable range of cutoff parametes , the physical observable is insensitive to the change of the cutoffs .",
    "the procedure taken in @xcite to implement this strategy was as follows .",
    "for both the deuteron and scattering wave functions , they are calculated from @xmath122 to a matching radius @xmath123  which plays the role of delineating short from long distance  using the one - pion exchange potential and for @xmath124 , a spherical well potential is assumed , the wave function of which is matched to the @xmath125 wave function .",
    "this procedure is applied to both the @xmath91 process and the pion capture ( [ pioncapture ] ) , with the coulomb effect suitably taken into account into the former .",
    "the coefficient @xmath121 is an important part of the @xmath111 that governs the @xmath91 process as given by the result ( [ s - factor ] ) .",
    "the result comes out to be _ 1 = & & -1.27  for  r=1.4  fm ,   0.48  for  r=2.2  fm , + & & 4.29  for  r=3.0  fm .    as in the solar neutrino case ,",
    "the @xmath121 varies widely for a range of the matching radius but the result for the radiative capture process ( [ pioncapture ] ) comes out to be highly insensitive to @xmath123 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pidr ]   is shown the capture rate for @xmath123 ranging widely from 1.4 fm to 3.0 fm .",
    "this illustrates how well the short - distance physics is captured by the simple procedure as in the @xmath91 case : while the results differ appreciably for the two widely different values of @xmath123 without the @xmath121 term in the  fsi \" region , they are very close ",
    "nearly indistinguishable  when the @xmath121 term is taken into account .",
    "a careful analysis of @xcite suggests that this procedure will be able to reduce the short - distance uncertainty in the determination of the @xmath126 scattering length by a factor of 3 relative to the value available up to date , to , say , @xmath127 0.05 fm .",
    "one can now pin - point how eft comes in to @xmath128 the snpa .",
    "this can be illustrated by the results of the @xmath61 process . in snpa approaches ,",
    "two - body corrections have been made in a procedure suggested a long time ago in @xcite . as discussed in @xcite , there are two serious problems with this procedure .",
    "the first is that without the guidance of the eft counting rule , terms of various chiral order are mixed in at the level of computing leading - order exchange current terms .",
    "this raises the question of consistency .",
    "since the corrections are chiral - filter unprotected , this inconsistency in chiral counting could generate serious errors .",
    "the second is more serious , having to do with the shorter - range interaction of the @xmath111 type . in the procedure of the snpa ,",
    "short - range interactions with the range shorter than the hard - core radius @xmath129 are killed by short - range correlations .",
    "this simply means that roughly speaking , terms of the @xmath111 type are missing . without the meeft strategy , what enters as corrections would be largely arbitrary .",
    "one can see from table [ tabl1a ] that without the balance from the @xmath111 term , the corrections are strongly dependent on the cut - off @xmath129 and hence totally arbitrary , with the result differing by several factors for different cut - offs .",
    "this arbitrariness is neatly circumvented by the meeft procedure at the level where the calculation can be done without unknown parameters .",
    "the @xmath111 effect can of course be incorporated in a rigeft with the pion field retained .",
    "given that what matters is the proper account of the long - wavelength physics governed by chiral symmetry and of the short - distance physics subsumed in the @xmath130 terms , the same set of systems could be treated in a pionful rigeft and a prediction ( parameter - free ) could be made .",
    "this exercise has not been done yet and it would be interesting to see to what extent the  high accuracy \" in snpa wave functions improves or worsens the prediction and to what extent there is inconsistency  if any  in chiral counting in the meeft procedure .",
    "so far we have discussed how to exploit eft in few - nucleon systems .",
    "can one extend the same strategy to heavier nuclei on the one hand and to nuclear matter on the other ?",
    "ultimately we would like to go to densities higher than that of nuclear matter so as to enter the regime where phase transitions to other forms of states  @xcite ( such as kaon condensation , quark matter etc . )",
    "are supposed to take place .    in rigeft , one might try to approach nuclear matter by doing high - order @xmath9pt starting with a chiral lagrangian appropriate for @xmath77-body systems but defined at zero density ( i.e. ,  free space \" ) by systematically including diagrams involving @xmath77 nucleons . a possible scenario  similar in spirit to the double decimation approach mentioned below and in @xcite ",
    "was suggested along this line by lynn  @xcite which consisted of first constructing a non - topological soliton , called ",
    "chiral liquid \" and then do fluctuations around the soliton .",
    "this program has not yet been successfully effectuated and it is not even clear that it is doable in practice .",
    "now in a much more practical way , one might extend the meeft method we described above for few - nucleon systems to many - nucleon systems with the ",
    "realistic \" two - body potentials used efficiently in the few - body problems supplemented with three - body and perhaps more - body potentials .",
    "the standard nuclear physics approach belongs to this class of approaches but , so far , without the proper incorporation of chiral symmetry .",
    "the question then is : how should one go about formulating an meeft that is applicable to heavy nuclei and nuclear matter ?",
    "this question is addressed elsewhere  @xcite after introducing the notion of hidden local symmetry in which vector mesons enter importantly as relevant degrees of freedom . here",
    "we mention merely that when one approaches the nuclear matter saturation density with the intention of going beyond the nuclear matter density , it is much more astute to approach the problem via multiple decimations in the renormalization group sense rather than going in one step as one does in the standard @xmath9pt approach .",
    "just to illustrate the basic idea , consider the density regime near the nuclear saturation density , @xmath131 @xmath132 .",
    "( things can become considerably subtler at higher densities . )",
    "now what characterizes nuclear matter is the presence of the fermi surface .",
    "it is understood that many - body interactions in the presence of fermi surfaces generically lead  with certain exceptions that we are not concerned with here  to an rg fixed point , known as",
    " fermi liquid fixed point\"@xcite .",
    "this means that starting from a chiral lagrangian defined at zero density , it makes a good sense to do the first decimation from the chiral scale @xmath133 gev to the scale at which the effective interactions between nucleons in medium are defined , say , @xmath134 and then make the second decimation to the fermi liquid fixed point by going from @xmath135 to the fermi surface . in both of these decimations , brown - rho scaling ( recently reviewed in @xcite )",
    "is found to play an essential role .",
    "it will turn out that this procedure is consistent with the vector manifestation phenomenon of hidden local symmetry theory described in @xcite .",
