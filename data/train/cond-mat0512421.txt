    "the transfer - matrix method has an advantage over the monte carlo method in that it provides information free from the statistical ( sampling ) error and the problem of slow relaxation to thermal equilibrium . on one hand ,",
    "the tractable system size is severely limited , because the transfer - matrix size increases exponentially as the system size enlarges .",
    "such a difficulty could be even more serious for `` geometrical '' problems such as the percolation , for which the configuration space is much larger than that of the ising model , for example .",
    "a transfer - matrix approach to the percolation in two dimensions ( @xmath4 ) was initiated by derrida and vannimenus @xcite .",

    "they estimated the correlation - length critical exponent as @xmath6 ; the variance is due to the choice of the boundary conditions .",
    "their result is quite consistent with the exact value @xmath7 , indicating that the transfer - matrix approach to percolation would be promising . because the transfer - matrix data are free from the statistical error , the data allow us to take its numerical derivative , which provides valuable information as to the subsequent finite - size - scaling analysis .",

    "actually , for @xmath0 , as the system size ( linear dimension ) @xmath8 enlarges , the number of constituent sites @xmath9 of the transfer - matrix unit soon exceeds the limit of the available computer resources .",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop an improved version of the transfer - matrix formalism for the @xmath0 bond percolation .",
    "for that purpose , we utilize novotny s idea , which has been applied successfully to various ising models in @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "his formalism stems on a very formal expression for the transfer - matrix elements .",
    "it enables us to consider arbitrary ( integral ) number of constituent sites @xmath11 even for @xmath12 . owing to this arbitrariness",

    "namely , they specified whether a cluster is connected with the `` origin '' or that a cluster is an isolated one",
    ". here , the `` origin '' stands for an edge of the transfer - matrix bar , an advantage of their extended representation is that one only needs to evaluate the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix to obtain the correlation length . here",
    ", however , we did not accept their representation scheme .",

    "this task is not so computationally demanding , and it renders significant simplification of the formalism mentioned below .      in this subsection , we present the explicit formula for the transfer - matrix elements .",
    "we consider an anisotropic bond percolation on the cubic lattice .",

    "[ figure1 ] . in this sense , it is by no means necessary to consider the isotropic condition @xmath117 specifically .",

    "second , we need to remedy the dimensionality @xmath0 by adjusting the ratio of the intra - cluster interactions @xmath119 .",
    "that is , the `` effective dimension '' @xcite can deviate slightly from @xmath0 , at least , for small system sizes .",
    "( this deviation deteriorates the finite - size - scaling analysis . )",
    "note that basically , the backbone structure of novotny s transfer matrix is of @xmath4 , and the dimensionality is lifted to @xmath0 by introducing the long - range interactions among the intra - cluster sites . in other words , it is not quite obvious that the dimensionality @xmath0 is realized precisely , at least , for small @xmath1 .",
    "hence , in order to remedy this dimensionality deviation , we should tune @xcite the intra - cluster - interaction ratio @xmath119 .",
    "( note that for large @xmath77 , the component @xmath120 dominates @xmath121 , and the dimensionality reduces to @xmath4 . for a certain moderate value of @xmath77 , the dimensionality would approach @xmath0 . ) more specifically , we adjusted @xmath77 so as to improve the finite - size - scaling behaviors of @xmath104 @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] . in this respect",
    ", there might exist alternative parameterization schemes other than the present one . here",

    "the slope well describes the behavior of the beta function in the vicinity of @xmath102 .",

    "[ figure4 ] , where we observe pronounced finite - size corrections to @xmath123 . however , these corrections are fairly systematic so that we could manage the extrapolation to @xmath115 rather unambiguously .",

    "we obtain the correlation - length critical exponent @xmath155 from a pair of @xmath156 and @xmath97 .",
    "however , for small @xmath1 , the data scatter , and eventually , even the zero point of the beta function disappears .",
    "because of this irregularity , we can not manage systematic extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit . in this sense ,",
    "the anisotropy parameter @xmath77 is significant in order to stabilize the finite - size corrections of the transfer - matrix data as demonstrated in the preceding subsections .",

    ", we tuned the anisotropy parameter to @xmath84 in order to reduce the finite - size corrections .",
    "because the system size along the transfer - matrix direction is infinite , it is by no means necessary to consider the isotropic limit @xmath152 specifically .",
