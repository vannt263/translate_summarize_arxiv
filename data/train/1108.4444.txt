    "for several decades , concentration and density field descriptions have been used to model the behavior of periodic micro- and mesoscopic systems .",
    "a prominent example is given by the ohta - kawasaki characterization of mesophases as they are observed in block copolymers @xcite .",
    "this description was derived by averaging over the local positions of the monomers that form the different blocks of the polymers .",
    "the procedure led to an effective continuum characterization of the observed periodic structures by the famous ohta - kawasaki energy functional . in the case of incompressible diblock copolymers ,",
    "the order parameter is given by the concentration of one of the two monomer types that form the different blocks .",
    "this is why we call this sort of characterization a concentration field description in the following .",
    "since then , a lot of studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach .",
    "for instance , the kinetic evolution of the periodic mesophase textures from the disordered ( spatially homogeneous ) state has been investigated @xcite .",
    "also the kinetic evolution from one texture to the other after temperature quenches has been analyzed @xcite .",
    "elastic moduli characterizing deformations of the textures were determined @xcite , and rheological properties of such structures were studied @xcite .    in a recent model of similar spirit",
    ", an energy functional has been postulated to characterize the behavior of crystalline structures through a density field description .",
    "we refer to the phase field crystal model suggested by elder and grant @xcite .",
    "periodicity of the density field is put into the model by energetically stabilizing at least one nonzero wave vector in the ground state .",
    "the magnitude of the subsequent periodic density field is interpreted as the averaged probability to find a constituent of the crystal .",
    "short timescales of motion are regarded as averaged over .",
    "because of this , the approach is very effective in modeling processes in crystals on timescales that are long from a molecular dynamics point of view .",
    "we refer to such a model as a density field description because the order parameter is related to a mass density rather than a concentration field .",
    "kinetic evolution of periodic patterns from a disordered state and corresponding phase diagrams have been analyzed in the framework of the phase field crystal model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the approach has been used to describe the motion of defects in crystalline structures @xcite , including avalanche events @xcite .",
    "the phase field crystal model has been shown to be a starting point for multiscale simulations of multidomain structures @xcite .",
    "in addition , the suitability for the characterization of epitaxial growth and crack propagation has been pointed out @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that averaging the trajectories obtained from molecular dynamics simulations indeed leads to density fields that can be captured by the phase field crystal model @xcite .",
    "the connection to classical density functional theory is of current interest @xcite .",
    "both of the two approaches outlined above can be interpreted as describing a sort of phase separation on micro- or mesoscopic length scales .",
    "this means that macroscopic coarse - graining of the observed structures , which sets in , for example , in the case of the cahn - hilliard model @xcite , is suppressed .",
    "the structures that are obtained are periodic in space . or",
    ", at least , if we think of defect - rich and/or multi - domain structures , the energetically favored ground state is periodic in space .",
    "it is our goal in this paper to describe a sort of microphase separation that does not feature this tendency and is nonperiodic in space .",
    "whereas the phase field crystal model has been successful to characterize processes in crystalline materials , our approach may be interesting to model amorphous materials such as polymers .    in the next section",
    "we phenomenologically introduce such a nonlocal energy functional and motivate the concept behind it .",
    "we explain how we numerically solve the corresponding kinetic equation in the appendix .",
    "after that , in section [ textures ] , we give an overview on the textures that are obtained from minimizing the energy functional . in particular",
    ", we focus on the time evolution of the structures as they develop from the disordered state . at this stage , coarse - graining to macrophase separation",
    "still sets in .",
    "we therefore present a modification to our model in section [ stripes ] , which leads to stabilized stripe phases that do not phase separate macroscopically .",
    "some possible applications , predominantly in the field of soft matter systems , are pointed out in section [ applications ] , before we conclude .",
    "as pointed out above , we now introduce a simple energy functional that produces localized nonperiodic structures .",
    "the functional is introduced in a phenomenological way .",
