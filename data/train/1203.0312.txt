    "georgi @xcite , introduced a new approach to studying conformal sectors by specifying the two - point functions of scalar fields with a scaling dimension between one and two . since the phase space for these fields resembles the phase space of a fractional number of particles , georgi termed them `` unparticles '' .",
    "subsequently , efforts were made to gauge unparticle actions in a consistent way @xcite so that unparticles could be given standard model ( sm ) gauge quantum numbers .",
    "this also necessitates the introduction of an ir cutoff for the unparticle sector @xcite so that there are no new massless modes , which would dramatically alter low energy phenomenology .",
    "reference @xcite introduced the unhiggs as a way to break electroweak symmetry via an unparticle ( see @xcite for work on related ideas ) .",
    "the unhiggs has the same gauge structure as the sm higgs with a scaling dimension @xmath2 and an ir cutoff @xmath5 .",
    "the effects of an unhiggs on precision electroweak measurements have been studied in detail @xcite , and the model is consistent with the current data . in @xcite , it was demonstrated that like the sm higgs , the unhiggs unitarizes @xmath6 scattering and also that the unhiggs can help ease the little hierarchy problem .",
    "reference @xcite began to look into phenomenological aspects of the unhiggs model , specifically the top quark decay @xmath7 . due to",
    "the fact that the longitudinal @xmath8 bosons are affected by the electroweak symmetry breaking sector , the fraction of emitted longitudinal @xmath8 bosons is different in the unhiggs model than it is in the sm .",
    "this information was used , along with cdf data and upcoming anticipated large hadron collider ( lhc ) data , to put current and expected bounds on the @xmath9 parameter space in the unhiggs model . in this paper",
    "we comment on the lhc phenomenology of the unhiggs model in the parameter range @xmath10 and return to a more theoretical aspect of the unhiggs model , that of perturbative unitarity for @xmath11 .",
    "we examine to what extent the unhiggs can be constrained , ruled out or even measured statistically significant at the lhc if @xmath1 in the heavy mass region .",
    "this is the mass range where higgs decays in the sm are dominated by decays to massive gauge bosons .",
    "it is difficult to get around the current exclusion bounds @xcite in this channel as a consequence of electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite , which guarantees @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "we will see that the unhiggs model is an efficient realization of such a hiding mechanism , and from this point of view the unhiggs phenomenology in the clean @xmath14 final state is especially interesting to reinterpret the current and future bounds on sm - like production @xcite .",
    "for the parameter choice @xmath1 we can expect a valid effective theory description by the unhiggs model up to several tev @xcite .",
    "we will see that a non - observation of the higgs boson can be consistently interpreted in this model .",
    "increasing @xmath2 beyond 1.5 , we show that the yukawa coupling in the original formulation of the unhiggs @xcite , which explicitly breaks the conformal symmetry , is the root cause of unitarity violation in massive quark scattering @xmath15 .",
    "we show analytically that this `` non - conformal '' yukawa coupling is not sufficient to preserve unitarity for values of the scaling dimension @xmath2 greater than 1.5 .",
    "to preserve unitarity , we need to derive a form of the yukawa coupling which respects the conformal symmetry of the model .",
    "we accomplish this by appealing to the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , considering an ads dual to the unhiggs model .",
    "once gauged , this `` conformal '' yukawa coupling will also necessitate the presence of terms in the lagrangian with arbitrary numbers of gauge bosons .",
    "taking these new terms into account , we find that unitarity is indeed preserved for all values of @xmath2 in the range @xmath4 .",
    "we show first that the yukawa coupling in @xcite which is the most naive extension of the sm yukawa coupling to an unparticle , is sufficient to preserve perturbative unitarity in the scattering process @xmath17 ( @xmath18 )",
    ". we will assume the scattering particles are top quarks , but the same general analysis follows for the other sm fermions as well .",
    "in the sm , there are four tree level diagrams contributing to @xmath19 .",
    "these diagrams involve exchange of an @xmath20-channel photon , an @xmath20-channel @xmath21 boson , a @xmath22-channel bottom quark and an @xmath20-channel higgs , and all have an analog in the unhiggs model ( see figures [ fig : david1 ] and [ fig : david2 ] ) .",
    "the three diagrams in figure [ fig : david1 ] that do not contain an unhiggs have the same amplitude as in the standard model .",
    "this is obvious for the diagram with the @xmath22-channel bottom exchange because the bottom - top-@xmath8 vertices as well as the bottom propagator are completely independent of the ewsb sector .    the @xmath20-channel photon and @xmath21 diagrams also yield the same amplitudes as in the sm , although it is not as obvious , because not only are their propagators different in the unhiggs model , but there are additional vertices not present in the sm which would seem to contribute new diagrams to the scattering amplitude .",
    "first we will address the propagators .",
    "the photon and @xmath21 propagator in the unhiggs model are both of the form @xmath23 the function @xmath24 is different for the photon and @xmath21 , and both are different from their counterparts in the sm .",
    "these functions are given in @xcite , but their actual form is unimportant because we will show that any term proportional to @xmath25 in the propagator disappears in the amplitude for the @xmath20-channel exchange diagram . by contracting the second term in the propagator with the @xmath26 or @xmath27 sm vertex and the polarization vectors , we find that both amplitudes are proportional to @xmath28    { { \\varepsilon}}_\\lambda(k^-){{\\varepsilon}}_\\alpha(k^+)\\ ] ] where @xmath29 are the momenta of the @xmath30 bosons , and @xmath31 is a dirac chain representing the rest of the amplitude . using @xmath32 , where @xmath33 are the quark momenta ( _ cf . _",
    "[ fig : david1 ] ) , we find that @xmath34 plugging in , this gives us @xmath35 = 0 $ ] .",
    "thus , the part of the propagator proportional to @xmath36 does not contribute to the amplitude and therefore the fact that the functions @xmath24 are different in the unhiggs model and the sm does not affect the amplitudes .",
    "next we must address the fact that there are new vertices in the unhiggs model which naively contribute to the @xmath20-channel photon and @xmath21 amplitudes . because of the non - local kinetic term in the unhiggs model , there are vertices with two unhiggs and arbitrary numbers of gauge bosons .",
    "specifically there are @xmath37 and @xmath38 vertices , and upon taking the unhiggs to vevs , these new three gauge boson vertices contribute to the amplitudes for the @xmath20-channel scattering processes .",
    "however , by using the method of gauging non - local lagrangians given in @xcite , we find that these vertices contain only terms proportional either to @xmath39 and/or @xmath40 . upon contracting these vertices with the polarization vectors @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    "the amplitude vanishes .",
    "therefore , the amplitudes resulting from the three diagrams shown in figure [ fig : david1 ] all take the same values as in the sm .",
    "the three diagrams not involving the unhiggs.,height=151 ]     the @xmath20-channel unhiggs exchange diagram.,height=188 ]    the results for these amplitudes in the sm are given in @xcite .",
    "the cases where the top and anti - top have opposite helicities are not of interest because the unhiggs exchange diagram is only non - zero when the helicities are either both right - handed or both left - handed . in other words , in the cases with opposite helicity , the three non - higgs diagrams are all that is needed to preserve unitarity . in @xcite",
    "it is indeed explicitly shown that these three diagrams conspire together to cancel all terms which are proportional to positive powers of the center of mass energy @xmath43 .",
    "as for the cases where the helicities of the top and anti - top are the same , the results are also given in @xcite .",
    "we will write the results for the top and anti - top having right - handed helicities here for future reference , keeping only the terms which grow with energy . @xmath44 \\cos\\theta \\sqrt{s } \\\\    { \\cal{m}}_{b , rr } = & \\sqrt{2 } g_f m_t(1 - \\cos \\theta ) \\sqrt{s}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the angle between the outgoing top quark and @xmath46 .",
    "adding these three contributions , we get @xmath47 in the standard model , the @xmath20-channel higgs exchange diagram is given by @xmath48 the cases with both particles left - handed is identical other than an opposite overall sign .",
    "we will therefore consider only the right - handed case for the rest of the paper with no loss of generality .",
    "clearly in the sm the terms which grow with energy cancel once the higgs exchange is included .     the @xmath49 cross section for different values of the unhiggs scaling dimensions @xmath2.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we now show that the unhiggs exchange diagram in figure [ fig : david2 ] , using the naive `` non - conformal '' yukawa coupling from @xcite , is not sufficient to preserve unitarity for the entire range of @xmath2 , @xmath50 .",
    "the yukawa term in the lagrangian in the original paper is given by @xmath51 where the `` @xmath52 '' stands for non - conformal .",
    "this yukawa coupling is identical to that in the sm other than dividing by a power of the uv cutoff @xmath53 which compensates for the fact that the unhiggs doublet has dimension @xmath2 instead of one .",
    "this leads to a coupling between the physical unhiggs and @xmath54 given by @xmath55 with @xmath56 the @xmath57 vertex , when contracted with the polarization vectors , is given by @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 and the unhiggs propagator is given by @xmath60 putting all of this together , the amplitude for the @xmath20-channel unhiggs scattering ( with helicities unspecified for now ) is then given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the momenta of the incoming @xmath22 and @xmath64 quarks respectively .",
    "after specifying the helicities ( both right - handed ) of the fermions and the polarizations ( longitudinal ) of the @xmath8s , we find that in the limit that @xmath65 @xmath66.\\ ] ] finally we add this to the contribution to the amplitude from the other three diagrams given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : david2.6 ] ) to get @xmath67 we can now safely take the limit @xmath68 which yields @xmath69 the amplitude is an increasing function of @xmath20 for @xmath70 , with the consequence that unitarity is not preserved in this process for @xmath71 ( figure [ fig : ttww ] ) .      in this section ,",
    "we comment on the collider phenomenology that arises from the modified yukawa and gauge sector of the unhiggs model in the parameter range @xmath72 .",
    "there are two sources of potential deviations of the unhiggs scenario from sm - like production due to the underlying conformal structure of the symmetry breaking sector , which can be accessed in production processes of massive electroweak bosons @xcite :    1 .   by eating a continuum goldstone boson ,",
    "the phase space of the longitudinal @xmath8 receives a continuum contribution above the conformal symmetry breaking scale @xmath5 , + [ eq : xsecps ] @xmath73 where @xmath74 2 .",
    "the unhiggs , the @xmath75 propagators and the trilinear @xmath76 and @xmath77 vertices are modified with respect to the sm , yielding , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath78}{(\\mu^2 - q^2)^{2 - d}-(\\mu^2 -         m_h^2)^{2 - d } }     \\right|^2_{q^2=\\sqrt{s}}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the partonic center of mass energy as usual .",
    "note that for @xmath79 we have @xmath80 .",
    "we include both effects in figure  [ fig : plot_gg ] , which compares @xmath81 in the unhiggs scenario and the standard model ( sm ) at the parton level for the typical scales which are probed at the lhc .",
    "we do not include the parton distribution functions at this point to make the comparison more transparent ; comparing the main production mode contributing to the @xmath82 cross sections at the lhc for unhiggs and sm production , the gluon parton distribution have no phenomenological impact since they are identical .",
    "integrating over the partonic energy fractions in computing the hadronic cross section , characteristics of comparison such as the dip for @xmath83 are completely washed out .",
    "the cross section qualitatively follows eq .",
    "( [ eq : xsecshape ] ) with the continuum contributions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : xsecps ] ) ranging at the percent - level for fully - inclusive production .",
    "an important feature of unhiggs production @xmath84 is that , with respect to the sm , the cross section decreases for scaling dimensions @xmath85 .",
    "this is a consequence of the unhiggs gauge interactions @xmath86 where @xmath87 denotes the familiar @xmath88 gauge covariant derivative .",
    "consequently , the gauge interactions of the unhiggs can be dialed away by increasing @xmath2 while keeping the @xmath8 and @xmath21 masses fixed .",
    "this can lead to a qualitatively different phenomenology compared to sm gluon fusion : the total unhiggs cross section can remain small even if large corrections from strong interactions @xcite are taken into account . at the same time , however , the unhiggs branching ratios to massive gauge bosons decrease and , depending on the higgs mass region , the unhiggs can avoid the current lhc bounds  @xcite .    the phenomenology of longitudinal polarizations of the massive @xmath8s and @xmath21s probes the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and is generically buried in a much larger transversely - polarized @xmath89 spectrum .",
    "the longitudinal polarizations can , in principle , be extracted by exploiting the @xmath90 s characteristic decay and radiation pattern . while these effects are well - investigated for weak boson fusion ( wbf ) @xcite where they have motivated a central jet veto to enhance longitudinal over transverse polarizations @xcite , only recently in ref .",
    "@xcite similar concepts have been applied to final state jet correlations in the context of subjet analyses . in total , however , getting a handle on the longitudinal part of the massive weak bosons remains an experimentally as well as theoretically ambitious task at hadron colliders .",

    "( [ eq : xsecps ] ) amounts to measuring a small excesses over the sm expectation in the invariant @xmath92 mass tails .",
    "eventually , this becomes a hopeless endeavor at hadron colliders once theoretical and experimental systematic uncertainties of both the signal and the background of the order of a few percent are properly taken into account .",
    "hence , in the actual experimental analysis , the focus is on reconstructing the unitarizing resonance mass . to dig out a resonance from a large continuous background we have to reconstruct the heavy gauge boson masses from their decay products",
    "this is achieved by requiring the @xmath89 decay product candidates to recombine the @xmath89 mass within a certain mass window , which is essentially set by the experiment s resolution ( see refs .",
    "this eventually removes the reducible backgrounds to a large extent , but also the continuum contribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xsecps ] ) is excluded from the experimentally observed signal cross section due to the imposed selection criteria on either the fully - reconstructed invariant mass distribution or the transverse mass distribution of the partially - reconstructed final states ( _ e.g. _  by projecting on events around the jacobian peak in the transverse cluster mass @xcite ) .",

    "the @xmath75 propagators in the unhiggs model show modifications compared to the sm only in terms proportional to the four momentum , eq .",

    "for the computation of figure  [ fig : plot_gg ] we found that the continuum leaves minor modifications in only the longitudinal components .",
