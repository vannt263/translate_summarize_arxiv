    "thus the isotropy representation @xmath429 must admit either an invariant @xmath452-plane with an invariant complement ( 3-plane ) , or two distinct invariant @xmath452-planes .",
    "the isotropy representation @xmath460 admits one invariant 2-plane , but neither of the possible complements .",
    "this is the final contradiction , and we are done .",
    "this concludes the proof of theorem [ thm2 ] .",
    "in this section we discuss the maximal and submaximal symmetry models from theorems [ thm1 ] and [ thm2 ] in more detail , expanding on remark [ rk1 ] .",
    "let us visualize the para - complex structure @xmath0 via the root diagram of the maximal and submaximal lie algebras of symmetries .",
    "below are the root systems of @xmath28 and @xmath461 respectively .",
    "the black ( unmarked ) arrows together with the cartan subalgebra form the root system of the subalgebra @xmath138 .",
    "it is @xmath462 and @xmath463 respectively .",
    "the root vectors corresponding to coloured ( marked ) roots span the representation space @xmath140 ( one easily confirms that @xmath140 is a module over @xmath138 ) .",
    "the red vectors ( marked with squares at the endpoints ) correspond to @xmath128 and the blue ones ( marked with circles at the endpoints ) correspond to @xmath195 ( up to interchange @xmath464 ) .    since the pairwise sums of the red vectors coincide with the blue ones and otherwise around",
    ", we conclude that the brackets @xmath465 and @xmath466 are isomorphisms .",
    "thus the linear operator @xmath467 for which @xmath128 and @xmath195 are @xmath19 eigenspaces defines a non - degenerate para - complex structure .      for the maximal symmetry model",
    "let us explain a diffeomorphism of @xmath27 to @xmath45 : @xmath6 is represented as a subgroup of @xmath468 acting on @xmath469 .",
    "the stabilizer of a point @xmath277 with @xmath470 is @xmath230 ( while that of a point @xmath277 with @xmath471 is @xmath472 @xcite ) .",
    "this unit sphere @xmath473 has the required topological type .    to approach the submaximally symmetric model ,",
    "let us begin with the linear group quotient @xmath419 . by the results on the isotropy representation from ",
    "[ s54 ] , the subgroup is embedded into @xmath37 as follows .",
    "consider a splitting @xmath474 into a sum of two symplectic planes .",
    "let @xmath475 act on the first summand and @xmath476 act on the second summand ( this explains why the action is not by @xmath477 but by @xmath478 ) .",
    "the subgroup @xmath478 is the reductive part ( corresponding to the zero grading ) of the parabolic subgroup @xmath479 stabilizing a ray in @xmath480 .",
    "clearly the space of rays is @xmath481 .",
    "the subgroup @xmath482 determines @xmath483-grading on the group , in particular the nilradical of @xmath482 is the heisenberg 3-group .",
    "this implies that @xmath484 is topologically a vector 3-space @xmath485 , but it has an invariant splitting @xmath486 .",
    "thus the exact sequence @xmath487 implies that @xmath46 is a non - trivial bundle .",
    "due to what was said above , this bundle splits into 1-dimensional trivial ( @xmath488 ) and 2-dimensional non - trivial ( @xmath489 ) subbundles .",
    "let us pass to a description on all complete submaximal models , which are those homogeneous spaces with the same isotropy data as for @xmath490 described above .",
    "first notice that the subalgebra @xmath491 is self - normalizing .",
    "the normalizer of the subgroup @xmath492 is obtained by adding the element @xmath493 that coincides with @xmath494 modulo the subgroup ( in other words , enlarging by it is equivalent to passing from @xmath495 to @xmath496 ) .",
    "thus the only centralizer element not belonging to the subgroup is @xmath497 ( modulo the subgroup center that is @xmath498 ) .",
    "consequently , the only quotient of @xmath499 carrying the required geometry is @xmath500 .",
    "the subgroup projects isomorphically ( notice that if we take a larger subgroup @xmath501 , the projection has kernel @xmath502 , and @xmath503 projects to the same @xmath504 ) ; in fact the embedding @xmath505 is @xmath506 , where the diagonal square blocks have sizes @xmath507 and the signature of each @xmath508 block is @xmath509 .",
    "consequently we get the quotient @xmath510 .",
    "the fundamental group of the linear symplectic group is @xmath511 with the generator being given through our subgroup embedding @xmath512 .",
    "thus when lifting the group the subgroup also lifts , and we get the quotient of non - algebraic simply - connected groups equal to our above quotient @xmath513 now @xmath514 has center @xmath515 ( generated by @xmath516 and the element @xmath497 of @xmath37 ) , and since the normalizer of @xmath517 is generated by this subgroup and @xmath497 , the only admissible quotients are by the subgroups of @xmath518 .",
    "however any subgroup @xmath519 of the first factor gives the same homogeneous space @xmath520 .",
    "thus the only non - trivial quotient arises from the second factor ( @xmath502 ) , so the only two submaximal models are @xmath521 and @xmath522 .",
    "every non - degenerate para - complex manifold @xmath22 has a compatible metric of signature @xmath49 .",
    "indeed , the tangent space decomposes as @xmath9 and the two summands are dual of each other .",
    "thus their pairing gives the required metric @xmath523 , where @xmath524 are the projections .",
    "this structure satisfies the relation @xmath525 .",
    "associated to this is the skew - symmetric form @xmath526 .",
    "non - degeneracy of @xmath0 implies that @xmath196 is almost symplectic .",
    "thus non - degenerate para - complex structures induce almost para - hermitian geometry .",
    "since @xmath3 is non - degenerate , the 2-form is never symplectic . in this case",
    "we can address the issue of whether the structure @xmath52 on @xmath1 is strictly nearly para - khler , which means that @xmath527 is totally skew - symmetric ( equivalently this means @xmath528 ) .",
    "since @xmath529 , where @xmath530 is the projection , this implies that @xmath531 .",
    "consider now the maximally symmetric model @xmath27 . in this case both @xmath532 modules @xmath533 and @xmath534 contain precisely 2 trivial summands ( for @xmath535 the decomposition is computed straightforwardly and verified in lie ) .",
    "thus @xmath536 is an isomorphism , and so the @xmath6-invariant structure @xmath52 is strictly nearly para - khler .",
    "next consider one of two models of submaximal symmetry , e.g.  simply - connected @xmath419 . in this case",
    "the trivial module @xmath537 is 4-dimensional , while dimension of @xmath538 is 2 .",
    "thus the corresponding projection @xmath539 is not injective and we can not conclude strict nearly para - khler property by pure representation theoretic arguments .",
    "this however can be observed by straightforward computations , and we exploited maple to facilitate those .",
    "we conclude the following .",
    "the maximal and both submaximal symmetry models are strictly nearly para - khler .    if the symmetry group of a non - degenerate para - hermitian structure has @xmath540 , the homogeneous space @xmath57 no longer needs be nearly para - khler : there are models that satisfy the corresponding property and models that violate it .",
    "assume that the action of the symmetry pseudogroup @xmath5 on @xmath22 or its lie algebra @xmath139 is not locally transitive , i.e.  there are no open orbits and so there are local invariants @xmath542 of the foliations by @xmath5-orbits .",
    "we continue writing @xmath543 for the tangent space representation of the isotropy algebra @xmath138 ( @xmath428 is a chosen point ) , and we write @xmath544 for the tangent to the orbit @xmath545 .    in what follows we restrict to the set @xmath546 of regular points in a neighborhood of which",
    "the orbits fiber the space ; this set @xmath547 is open and dense in @xmath1 .",
    "assuming @xmath548 and denoting by @xmath138 the isotropy at @xmath549 , the following properties hold :    1 .",
    "the normal bundle @xmath550 is a trivial @xmath138-representation belongs to a singular orbit , this fact is usually false . ] ( this is because the differentials of the invariants @xmath551 span @xmath552 , cf .",
    "* lemma 3 ) ) .",
    "we have @xmath553 and @xmath554 . indeed , if @xmath555 , then @xmath556\\subset[\\mathfrak{o},\\mathfrak{o}]=\\mathfrak{o}$ ] ( the tangent distribution to the foliation by orbits is integrable ) .",
    "we have @xmath557 . indeed ,",
    "if say @xmath558 , then @xmath559 is a trivial @xmath138-representation , whence @xmath560 and @xmath140 are also trivial .",
    "the bundles @xmath561 are trivial @xmath138-representations .      from ( 2 ) and ( 3 )",
    "we conclude that @xmath565 are proper subbundles , so the rank of each of them is either 1 or 2 .",
    "if the rank of @xmath566 is 1 , then the corresponding representation of @xmath567 on @xmath568 has matrix form with two rows zero , and since the isotropy representation is faithful we get @xmath569",
    ". then @xmath570 .",
    "thus we have to consider only the case when ranks of both @xmath571 is 2 . in this case",
    "the matrix representation of @xmath138 has one trivial row , and so @xmath572 .",
    "so if @xmath573 we conclude @xmath574 .",
    "consider the cases @xmath575 , @xmath576 .",
    "a plane @xmath577 in @xmath578 determines by duality a line @xmath579 .",
    "if this does not belong to @xmath580 , then @xmath581 is split into the sum of a plane ( non - trivial @xmath138-module ) and line ( trivial @xmath138-module ) , whence @xmath582 that implies @xmath574 .",
    "thus we assume that the line belongs to @xmath580 , and so @xmath581 has an invariant flag of subspaces .",
    "consequently @xmath583  the borel subalgebra in @xmath462 .",
    "representation on @xmath578 is dual , and we obtain the matrix form of the representation @xmath584 : @xmath585 & \\mathbf{0 } \\\\",
    "\\mathbf{0 } & \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc }   -a_1 & 0 & 0 \\\\   -a_2 & a_1+a_5 & 0 \\\\   -a_3 & -a_4 & -a_5   \\end{array}\\right ] \\end{array}\\right]\\ ] ]    the first @xmath508 sub - block in the first diagonal @xmath586 block ( @xmath581 ) corresponds to @xmath580 , and so by property ( 4 ) the last row of this @xmath586 block vanishes : @xmath587 .",
    "similarly , the second @xmath508 sub - block in the second diagonal @xmath586 block ( @xmath578 ) corresponds to @xmath577 , and so by property ( 4 ) the first row of this @xmath586 block vanishes : @xmath354 .",
    "therefore @xmath588 , and @xmath589 .",
    "thus non - degenerate para - complex 6d manifolds with the symmetry of dimension at least 9 are locally homogeneous spaces and hence can be classified .",
    "in particular , for @xmath541 similarly to @xcite , one can obtain a classification of such homogeneous spaces with a simple isotropy @xmath138 .            r.l .",
