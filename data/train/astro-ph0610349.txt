    "the distant red galaxies ( drgs ) are selected in the near - infrared ( nir ) wavelength by the simple criterion @xmath3 in order to sample high - redshift ( @xmath12 ) galaxies with significant fraction of evolved stars such as normal galaxies seen in the present universe , which are often missed by the `` drop - out '' selection technique for the lyman break galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "these red @xmath13 colors are produced by balmer/4000 - break at @xmath14 ( the breaks enter between @xmath15 and @xmath16-bands ) and/or heavy dust extinction at similar redshift .",
    "in fact , several drgs are confirmed to be at @xmath10 by spectroscopy ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and their photometric redshift also lies in the range of @xmath14 ( @xcite ) .",
    "several studies found that many drgs have high star formation rates ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , while some of them seem to have little star formation activity and evolve passively ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "analyses of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) suggest that drgs are more massive ( m@xmath17m@xmath18 ) and older ( @xmath191 - 3 gyr old ) than the uv - bright lbgs at similar redshifts ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the strong angular clustering of these galaxies has also been reported ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , most of these previous studies have focused on the bright ( massive ) part of drgs .",
    "it is important to sample fainter drgs and investigate their properties in order to understand the formation and evolution of more `` normal '' galaxies .",
    "galaxies with the luminosity of l@xmath20 or sub - l@xmath20 at @xmath21 would have k - band magnitude of @xmath2222 - 23 .",
    "such very deep nir data have been limited to relatively small areas so far ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use very deep and wide nir data taken with moircs on the subaru telescope in order to investigate the number counts of drgs down to @xmath23 .",
    "the wide field of view of moircs ( @xmath24 arcmin@xmath1 ) and the large collecting area of the telescope allow us to analyze drgs to the faint magnitude with high statistical accuracy .",
    "the vega - referred magnitude system is used throughout the paper .",
    "we performed @xmath25-bands imaging observations of a part of the great observatories origins deep survey north ( goods - n ) field with multi - object infrared camera and spectrograph ( moircs , @xcite ) on the subaru telescope on 2006 april 4 - 9,18 and may 10 - 11,18 - 19 .",
    "moircs has the field of view of about 4 @xmath0 7 arcmin@xmath1 with 0.117 arcsec pixel scale .",
    "we observed one field of view of moircs centered on 12@xmath26 , @xmath27 ( j2000 ) , which included the original hubble deep field north ( hdf - n , @xcite ) . here we use the high - quality @xmath15 and @xmath28-bands data sets which include only the frames with the seeing size smaller than 0.5 arcsec ( fwhm ) .",
    "the corresponding exposure times are 5.0 hours in @xmath15-band and 7.7 hours in @xmath28-band . the data were reduced in a standard way using the iraf software package . at first",
    "the self - skyflat frame was made and used for the flat - fielding .",
    "we then performed the sky subtraction , and co - registered and combined the data .",
    "the details of the data processing and the data quality are described in konishi et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the fwhms of the psfs of the combined images are 0.42 arcsec in @xmath15-band and 0.40 arcsec in @xmath28-band , and the @xmath28-band image was convolved with a gaussian kernel to match the psf to that in @xmath15-band .",
    "fs23 and fs27 in the ukirt faint standard stars were used for the flux calibrations in the @xmath15 and @xmath16-bands .",
    "we excluded the edges of the images with lower sensitivities , and our final multi - band combined images have a slightly smaller field of view of about 24.3 arcmin@xmath1 .",
    "source detection was performed in the @xmath28-band image using the sextractor image analysis package ( @xcite ) .",
    "we adopted mag_auto from the sextractor as the total @xmath16-band magnitudes of the detected objects .",
    "for the color measurements , we used the fixed aperture with 0.85 arcsec diameter ( 2@xmath0fwhm ) , and the same apertures were used for @xmath15 and @xmath16-bands .",
    "the 5@xmath2 limiting magnitude at 0.85 arcsec diameter is about @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "we estimated the 1@xmath2 background fluctuation in each band by directly measuring the sky fluxes with 0.85 arcsec apertures randomly placed on the images .",
    "the estimated background fluctuations were used to calculate the photometric errors for the detected objects .",
    "we performed the simulations using the iraf / artdata package to quantify the detection completeness in @xmath16-band .",
    "our source detection is nearly complete for the point source to @xmath31 , and the completeness is 90% at @xmath32 .",
    "we also tested sensitivity to the false detections by running sextractor on the inverted @xmath28-band image .",
    "only 15 spurious objects were extracted at @xmath7 , while 1596 objects with @xmath7 were detected in the normal image .",

    "the sequence of these objects is seen at @xmath34 , which is consistent with the expected locus of the galactic stars .",
    "this suggests that the flux calibration of our data is good enough for the selection of drgs .",

    "we show the number counts of all @xmath16-selected objects and the drgs in the top panel .",
    "the @xmath16-band detection completeness mentioned in the previous section is also plotted .",
    "our data are nearly complete down to @xmath23 , and the number counts in figure [ fig : num ] are not corrected for the detection completeness .",
    "we also show @xmath16-band number counts in other general fields from the literature .",
    "the number counts of all @xmath16-selected objects in our data are consistent with those in other fields down to @xmath23 .",
    "the number of the detected drgs and their surface density in each @xmath16-band magnitude bin are also showed in table 1 .",
    "the interesting result in figure [ fig : num ] is that the number counts of drgs turn over at @xmath8 , while the @xmath16-band number counts continue to increase to at least @xmath23 , which corresponds to the completeness limit .    in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : num ] ,",
    "we compare the number counts of drgs in our data with those in other fields ( hdf - s , ms1054 - 03 , goods - south ) .",
    "the hdf - s data by the fires survey ( @xcite ) have the smaller area ( @xmath194.5 arcmin@xmath1 ) but reach to the deeper completeness limit ( @xmath2223.8 ) than our data .",
    "the areas of the goods - s and ms 1054 - 03 fields are comparable with or wider than this study ( @xmath19130 and @xmath1925 arcmin@xmath1 , respectively ) , but these data reach to the shallower limit of @xmath2221.5 - 22 .",
    "though these independent four fields have different areas and depths , the number counts of drgs in these fields agree well at @xmath6 . at @xmath9 ,",
    "only the hdf - s data have the sufficient depth and can be used for the comparison with out data .",
    "the number counts of drgs in the hdf - s do not show the decrease at @xmath9 , but are still consistent with our results within the uncertainty ( see also the next section ) .    in order to demonstrate the turnover of the drg counts or the deficit of the faint drgs relative to the brighter ones",
    ", we performed the linear fitting for the number counts of drgs at @xmath38 using the data in all four fields .",
    "the linear fitting at @xmath38 seems to be reasonable because foucaud et al .",
    "( 2006 ) reported the break feature of the drg counts lies at @xmath39 and the data over @xmath38 of all four fields were fitted well with the linear line .",
    "the result is plotted as the dashed line in figure [ fig : num ] .",
    "we also tried to fit the moircs data at @xmath6 with the maximum likelihood method without binning the data , and confirmed the very similar result of the fitted slope .",
    "thus the uncertainty due to the binning of the data does not affect the fitting result , even if there is a bin with the relatively low counts ( @xmath3621 - 21.5 bin ) .",
    "when we extrapolate this linear line to @xmath31 , the surface density of the faint drgs with @xmath40 in our field is clearly deficient .",
    "the density in the @xmath41 bin is about a factor of three lower than the extrapolation from the number counts at the brighter magnitude .",
    "if we perform the similar linear fitting for the moircs data over @xmath42 with the maximum likelihood method , the fitted slope become 0.19 @xmath4 0.04 , which is significantly flatter than the value for the fitting at @xmath38 ( 0.33 @xmath4 0.07 ) .",
    "it is seen that even in the hdf - s , the number of the faint drgs is lower than the extrapolation from the number counts at @xmath6 .",
    "in this section , we discuss the turnover of the number counts of drgs at @xmath8 found in the previous section .    at first , we consider the possible spurious effects which could cause the deficit of the faint drgs .",
    "one possibility is that the mag_auto would systematically underestimate the total flux in the @xmath16-band near the detection limit ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and this could cause the underestimation of the number of the faint drgs .",
    "the number counts of drgs , however , begin to decrease at @xmath8 , which is one magnitude brighter than the _ completeness _ limit in @xmath16-band , and this does not seem to be the case .",
    "for example , labb et al . ( 2003 ) showed such a underestimation occurs at @xmath43 , which is about 0.3 mag fainter than the completeness limit in their fires data .",
    "our simulation also indicates that the significant underestimation of the @xmath16-band flux does not exist down to at least @xmath23 ( konishi et al . in preparation ) .",
    "in fact , the @xmath16-band number counts continues to increase to @xmath23 in figure [ fig : num ] .",
    "we also confirmed that the size distribution of drgs with @xmath31 is not significantly different from that of the bluer objects .",
    "therefore there is no reason to think that only drgs are less complete at @xmath31 .",
    "since most drgs in our data are resolved , the completeness problems could be more severe than those for the point source .",
    "therefore we also checked the detection completeness for extended objects .",
    "we fitted the @xmath16-band surface brightness of relatively bright drgs with @xmath37 with the moffat function , and found that the average fwhm is about 0.58 arcsec . using this surface brightness profile ( assuming the same profile for the fainter drgs )",
    ", we performed the similar simulation with that for the point source to quantify the detection completeness as a function of @xmath16-band magnitude .",
    "the result is showed in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : num ] ( dotted line ) . the completeness is more than 90% at @xmath44 and is still 80% at @xmath23 .",
    "the detection incompleteness in @xmath16-band can not explain the observed deficit of the faint drgs .",
    "second possibility is that the larger error in @xmath13 color at the faint magnitude affects the sampling of drgs .",
    "although the depth of our @xmath15-band data ( the 2@xmath2 limit of @xmath35 ) is sufficient to sample the objects with @xmath3 to @xmath23 , some fraction of the faint drgs could be missed due to the photometric error .",
    "however , we conclude that the error in @xmath13 does not cause the deficit of the faint drgs , since the similar effect of the contamination from the bluer objects to the drg sample also exists .",
    "as discussed in foucaud et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , since the overall @xmath13 distribution of objects has the peak at the color substantially bluer than @xmath45 and the objects with @xmath3 are relatively rare ( figure [ fig : jk ] ) , it can be expected that the number density of drgs is rather boosted at fainter magnitudes .",
    "therefore these photometric errors do not seem to cause the observed deficit of drgs at @xmath9 .",
    "although the number counts of drgs in the hdf - s do not show the turnover at @xmath8 as seen in the previous section , the difference of the number density of drgs at @xmath9 between in the hdf - s and in our moircs field can be explained by the field - to - field variance , when the strong clustering of drgs is taken into account ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "grazian et al .",
    "( 2006 ) pointed out the large discrepancy of the number density of drgs with @xmath46 between the hdf - s and hdf - n ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "they reported that only two drgs ( one at @xmath37 , one at @xmath47 ) exist in the hdf - n , while many drgs are found in the hdf - s .",
    "this can be seen in our data . in figure",
    "[ fig : xy ] , we plot the spatial distribution of drgs in the moircs deep field .",
    "the region of the original hdf - n is also showed , and there are only two drgs with @xmath6 and one drg with @xmath40 in this region . on the other hand , there are many drgs over wide range of @xmath16-band magnitude outside the hdf - n region , and not only the bright drgs but also the faint ones with @xmath40 appear to show a relatively strong clustering .",
    "such a spatial distribution of drgs indicates that the small survey areas of the hdfs could introduce large uncertainty and the wide area survey is essential for the estimation of the number density of these galaxies .",
    "we will present the detailed analysis of the clustering property of these galaxies in ichikawa et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .      what does the deficit of the faint drgs at @xmath9 mean",
    "? the previous studies found that most drgs exist at @xmath10 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our photometric redshift estimation with the hst / acs and moircs data also suggests the similar redshift distribution ; 69 out of 86 drgs with photometric redshift ( those detected in more than two bands ) have @xmath11 ( konishi et al . in preparation ) . keeping in mind that some significant fraction of bright drgs confirmed to be at @xmath48 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) and that the reliability of photometric redshift for the faint drgs has not yet confirmed by spectroscopy",
    ", we assume that most drgs in our data lie at @xmath10 in the following discussion .",
    "the observed color of @xmath49 roughly corresponds to the rest - frame @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) at @xmath10 , which is similar with those of sc - sd galaxies seen in the present universe .",
    "such a red color for high - z objects ( about 2 - 3 gyr age of the universe at @xmath10 ) is considered to be produced by balmer/4000 - break of relatively old stellar population and/or heavy dust extinction as mentioned in section 1 .",
    "therefore , the turnover of the number counts of drgs indicates that while there are many bright ( massive ) galaxies with the old population and/or dusty star formation activity , the number of the faint galaxies with the similar red color is relatively small at that epoch .",
    "labb et al .",
    "( 2005 ) investigated the stellar mass and sed of drgs and lbgs with @xmath6 and found that drgs dominate the high - mass end at @xmath21 . on the other hand",
    ", our result from the wide and deep data could suggest that the low - mass end is dominated by galaxies with blue colors , which do not satisfy the criterion of drg . in figure",
    "[ fig : z3num ] , we show the @xmath16-band number counts of galaxies with @xmath11 for drgs ( @xmath3 ) and those with @xmath52 , separately .",
    "it is seen that the fraction of those with @xmath52 increases with decreasing @xmath16-band flux at @xmath53 , while the number density of drgs is comparable to that of the bluer objects at @xmath2220 - 21 .",
    "kajisawa and yamada ( 2005 , 2006 ) showed that most low - mass galaxies have the blue rest - frame @xmath54 color and the more massive galaxies tend to have the redder color even at @xmath55 .",
    "kajisawa & yamada ( 2006 ) also evaluated that the transition mass between these red and blue populations is about 6@xmath56m@xmath18 at @xmath55 , and in fact most of galaxies with m@xmath57m@xmath18 have the rather blue color of @xmath58 ( their figure 2 ) . since the magnitude of @xmath59 of galaxies with @xmath45 corresponds to about 1 - 6@xmath56m@xmath18 at @xmath10 ( we calculated the stellar mass as in @xcite , using the galaxev population synthesis model of @xcite ) ,",
    "the deficit of drgs at @xmath9 could be explained by such a mass - dependent color distribution , if the similar trend continues to @xmath60 .",
