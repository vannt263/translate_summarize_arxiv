    "the goal of this paper is to construct solutions of a scalar , fractional ginzburg - landau ( or allen - cahn ) equation in a periodic medium , whose interface stays in a prescribed slab and whose energy is minimal among compact perturbations .",
    "the simplest case that we have in mind is the non - local equation @xmath0 in which  @xmath1 is a fractional parameter and  @xmath2 is a smooth function , bounded and bounded away from zero , and such that @xmath3 the operator  @xmath4 in   is a fractional power of the laplacian , see e.g.  @xcite for an introduction to this topic .    in the framework of equation  , the solution  @xmath5 $ ] represents a state parameter in a model of phase coexistence ( the two `` pure phases '' being represented by @xmath6 and  @xmath7 ) .",
    "the presence of a fractional exponent  @xmath1 is motivated by models which try to take into account long - range particle interactions ( as a matter of fact , these models may produce either a local or non - local tension effect , depending on the value of  @xmath8 , see  @xcite ) .",
    "we also recall that equations of this type naturally occur in other areas of applied mathematics , such as the peierls - nabarro model for crystal dislocations when  @xmath9 , and for generalizations of this model when  @xmath1 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "related problems also arise in models for diffusion of biological species ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the periodicity condition in   takes into account a possible geometric ( or crystalline ) structure of the medium in which the phase transition takes place .",
    "the level sets of the solution  @xmath10 have particular physical importance , since they correspond , at a large scale , to the interface between the two phases of system .",
    "the question that we address in this paper is then to find solutions of   whose level sets lie in any given strip of universal size .",
    "the direction of this strip will be arbitrary and the size of the strip is bounded independently on the direction .",
    "in addition to this geometric constraint on the level sets of the solution , we will also prescribe an energy condition .",
    "namely , equation   is variational . though the associated energy functional diverges ( i.e. nontrivial solutions have infinite total energy in the whole of the space ) , it is possible to `` localize '' the non - local energy density in any fixed domain of interest and require that the solution has a minimal property with respect to any perturbation supported in this domain .",
    "the existence of minimal solutions of phase transition equations whose level sets are confined in a strip goes back to  @xcite , where equation   was taken into account for  @xmath11 and it is strictly related to the construction , performed in  @xcite , of minimal surfaces which stay at a bounded distance from a plane ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , these types of results may be seen as the analogue in partial differential equations ( or pseudo - differential equations ) of the classical aubry - mather theory for dynamical systems , see  @xcite ( a more detailed discussion about the existence literature will follow ) .    as a matter of fact",
    ", we will consider here a more general equation than  .",
    "indeed , we will deal with operators that are more general than the fractional laplacian , which can be also spatially heterogeneous and periodic , and also with more general forcing terms , which may possess different growths from the pure phases other than the classical quadratic growth .",
    "the details of the mathematical framework in which we work are the following . for  @xmath12 , we consider the formal energy functional @xmath13    the term  @xmath14 $ ] is supposed to be a measurable and symmetric function , comparable to the kernel of the fractional laplacian .",
    "that is , @xmath15 and for large values of  @xmath16 - see e.g. hypothesis  ( 1.3 ) in  @xcite or  ( 2.2b ) in  @xcite - we prefer to adopt the more restrictive condition   in order to simplify the exposition .",

    "that is , @xmath33 and @xmath34 for any fixed  @xmath29 .",
    "the assumptions listed above allow us to comprise a very general class of kernels and potentials .    as possible choices for  @xmath17",
    ", we could indeed think of heterogeneous , isotropic kernels of the type @xmath35 for a measurable  @xmath36 $ ] , or instead consider a translation invariant , but anisotropic  @xmath17 , as given by @xmath37 with  @xmath38 a measurable norm in  @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , one can combine both heterogeneity and anisotropy to obtain , for instance , kernels of the form @xmath40 where  @xmath41 is a symmetric , uniformly elliptic  @xmath42 matrix with bounded entries .",
    "of course , the functions  @xmath43 and  @xmath41 should satisfy appropriate symmetry and periodicity conditions , in order that hypotheses   and   could be fulfilled by the resulting  @xmath17 s .",
    "also , such functions may exhibit a degenerate behavior when  @xmath44 and  @xmath45 are far from each other ( compare this with the left - hand side of  ) .",

    "in the present work we look for minimizers of the functional  @xmath50 which connects the two pure phases  @xmath6 and  @xmath22 , which are the zeroes of the potential  @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , given any vector  @xmath51 , we address the existence of minimizers for which , roughly speaking , _ most _ of the transition between the pure states occurs in a strip orthogonal to  @xmath52 and of universal width .",
    "moreover , when  @xmath52 is a rational vector , we want our minimizers to exhibit some kind of periodic behavior , consistent with that of the ambient space .",
    "note that we will often call a quantity _ universal _ if it depends at most on  @xmath53 ,  @xmath8 ,  @xmath54 ,  @xmath55 ,  @xmath56 and on the function  @xmath27 introduced in  .    in order to formulate an exact statement ,",
    "we introduce the following terminology . for a given  @xmath57",

    "we need to introduce an appropriate localized energy functional . given a set  @xmath66 and a function  @xmath62",
    ", we define the _ total energy _  @xmath50 of  @xmath10 in  @xmath67 as @xmath68 where @xmath69 notice that when  @xmath67 is the whole space  @xmath39 , then the energy   coincides with that anticipated in  .    sometimes ,",
    "a more flexible notation for this functional will turn out to be useful . to this aim , recalling our symmetry assumption   on  @xmath17 , we will refer to  @xmath70 as the sum of the _ _ kinetic part _ _ is typically used to describe non - local interactions and elastic forces . however , we adopt this slight abuse of terminology in conformity with the classical jargon used for local dirichlet energies in particle mechanics . ] @xmath71 with @xmath72 for any  @xmath73 , and the _ potential part _",

    "we also mention the pioneering work  @xcite of caffarelli and de la llave , where the two authors proved the existence of plane - like minimal surfaces with respect to periodic metrics of  @xmath39 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ mainthm ] makes use of a geometric and variational technique developed in  @xcite and  @xcite , suitably adapted in order to deal with non - local interactions . for a given rational direction  @xmath57 and a fixed strip @xmath97 \\right\\},\\ ] ] with  @xmath98 ,",
    "one takes advantage of the identifications of the quotient space  @xmath65 to gain the compactness needed to obtain a minimizer  @xmath99 with respect to periodic perturbations supported inside  @xmath100 . by construction ,",
    "this minimizer is such that its interface  @xmath101 is contained in the strip  @xmath100 .    with the aid of some geometrical arguments",
    ", one then shows that  @xmath99 becomes a class  a minimizer for  @xmath50 , provided  @xmath102 is larger than some universal parameter  @xmath103 . the fact that the threshold  @xmath103 is universal and that , in particular , it does not depend on the fixed direction  @xmath52 is of key importance here and it allows , as a byproduct , to obtain the result for an irrational vector  @xmath94 , by taking the limit of rational directions .",
    "we remark that the non - local character of the energy  @xmath50 introduces several challenging difficulties into the above scheme .",
    "first of all , the way the compactness is used to construct the minimizer  @xmath99 is somehow not as straightforward as in the local case .    to have a glimpse of this difference",
    ", consider that in  @xcite the candidate  @xmath99 is by definition a minimizer with respect to  @xmath64-periodic perturbations occurring in  @xmath100 .",
    "that is , one really considers the energy  @xmath50 driven by   as defined on the cylinder  @xmath65 viewed as a manifold and obtain  @xmath99 as the absolute minimizer of  @xmath50 within a particular class of functions defined on  @xmath65 .",
    "however , since the restriction of the local kinetic term   to a fundamental domain of  @xmath65 only  _ sees _ what happens inside that domain , it is clear that one is allowed in the local case to identify periodic perturbations and perturbations which are compactly supported inside  @xmath65 . as a result ,",
    "@xmath99 is automatically a local minimizer for  @xmath50 in the strip  @xmath100 .",
    "as it is , this technique can not work in the non - local setting .",
    "indeed , let  @xmath10 be any  @xmath64-periodic function and  @xmath104 be compactly supported in a fixed fundamental region  @xmath105 of  @xmath65 : if we denote by  @xmath106 the  @xmath64-periodic extension of  @xmath107 to  @xmath39 , then the two quantities  @xmath108 and  @xmath109 , as defined in  , are not equal in general .    in order to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we introduce an appropriate auxiliary functional  @xmath110 that is used to define the periodic minimizer  @xmath99 .",
    "then , it happens that  @xmath99 is a local minimizer for the original energy  @xmath50 , since  @xmath110 couples with  @xmath50 in a favorable way .",
    "an additional difficulty comes from the different asymptotic properties of the energy in terms of the fractional parameter  @xmath8 . as a matter of fact",
    ", the threshold  @xmath9 distinguishes the local and non - local behavior of the functional at a large scale ( see  @xcite ) and it reflects into the finiteness or infiniteness of the energy of the one - dimensional transition layer . in our setting , this feature implies that not all the kernels  @xmath17 satisfying   can be dealt with at the same time .",
    "more precisely , when  @xmath111 the behavior at infinity dictated by   causes infinite contributions coming from far .",
    "for this reason , at least at a first glance , it may seem necessary to restrict the class of admissible kernels by imposing some additional requirements on the decay of  @xmath17 at infinity .",
    "however , we will be able to remove this limitation by an appropriate limit procedure .",
    "namely , we will first assume a fast decay property of the kernel to obtain the existence of a class  a minimizer , but the estimates obtained will be independent of this additional assumption .",
    "consequently , we will be able to extend the result to general kernels by treating them as limits of truncated ones .",
    "finally , we want to point out a possibly interesting difference between the proof displayed here and that of e.g.  @xcite and  @xcite . in the existing literature , the technique that is typically adopted to show that  @xmath99 is a class  a minimizer relies on the so - called energy and density estimates .",
    "these estimates respectively deal with the growth of the energy  @xmath50 of a local minimizer  @xmath10 inside _ large _ balls and the fractions of such balls occupied by a fixed level set of  @xmath10 .",
    "the latter , in particular , is a powerful tool first introduced by caffarelli and crdoba in  @xcite to study the uniform convergence of the level sets of a family of _ scaled _ minimizers .",
    "although such density estimates have been established in  @xcite in a non - local setting very close to ours , for some technical reasons we decided not to incorporate them into our argument ( roughly speaking , the periodic setting is not immediately compatible with large balls in euclidean spaces ) . in their place",
    ", we take advantage of some  @xmath112 bounds satisfied by local minimizers of  @xmath50 , along with a suitable version of the energy estimates .",
    "the above mentioned hlder continuity result is essentially the regularity theory for bounded weak solutions to integro - differential equations developed by kassmann in  @xcite . on the other hand , energy estimates for minimizers of non - local energies",
    "have been independently obtained in  @xcite and  @xcite ( in different settings ) . since both",
    "these two results were set in a slightly different framework than ours , we provide their proofs in full details in sections  [ regsec ] and  [ enestsec ] , respectively .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "sections  [ regsec ] and  [ enestsec ] are devoted to the hlder regularity of the minimizers and the energy estimates .",
    "we stress that in these two sections both  @xmath17 and  @xmath21 are subjected to slightly more general requirements than those listed in the introduction ( the statements of the results proved in these sections will contain the precise hypotheses needed for their proofs ) .",
    "section  [ s>1/2sec ] is occupied by the main construction leading to the proof of theorem  [ mainthm ] . for the reader",
    "s ease , this section is in turn divided into seven short subsections . in each of these subsections",
    ", we will consider , respectively :    * the minimization arguments by compactness , * the notion of minimal minimizer ( i.e. the pointwise infimum of all the possible minimizers , which satisfy additional geometric and functional features ) , * the doubling property ( roughly , doubling the period does not change the minimal minimizer ) , * the notion of minimization under compact perturbations , * the birkhoff property ( namely , the level sets of the minimal minimizers are ordered by integer translations ) , * the passage from constrained to unconstrained minimization ( for large strips , we show that the constraint is irrelevant ) , * the passage from rational to irrational slopes .    the argument displayed in section  [ s>1/2sec ] only works under an additional assumption on the decay rate of the kernel  @xmath17 at infinity . in the subsequent section  [ s<1/2sec ]",
    "we will show that this hypothesis can be in fact removed by a limit procedure .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ mainthm ] will therefore be completed .",
    "we conclude this paper with two appendices which contain some auxiliary material needed for the technical steps in the proofs of our main results .",
    "in this introductory section we show that the local minimizers of  @xmath50 are hlder continuous functions . in order to do this ,",
    "we prove a general regularity result for bounded solutions to non - local equations driven by measurable kernels comparable to that of the fractional laplacian .    in this regard",
    ", we stress that the main result of this section - namely , theorem  [ holderthm ] - is stated in a broader setting , in comparison with the rest of the paper .",
    "the periodicity of the medium does not play any role here and it is therefore not assumed .",
