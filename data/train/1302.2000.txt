    "perhaps the most striking aspects of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are their strong evolution with redshift , and the strong correlations between the properties of the agn and those of their host galaxies .",

    "2001 , 2004 ) , while the latter involve , e.g. , the correlations between the stellar mass ( or the velocity dispersion of the bulge ) of the host galaxy and the mass of the accreting black hole powering the agn emission ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al .",

    "both such key features call for a cosmological explanation of the black hole and agn properties , which in fact constitutes one of the most pressing issues in astrophysics .    on the theoretical side , models aimed at describing the evolution of black holes and agn in a cosmological context are based on either n - body simulations and semi - analytic models .",
    "while the former have shown the importance of galaxy mergers as triggers for agn accretion and the role of the agn energy feedback in the subsequent evolution of the host galaxy ( see , e.g. , di matteo , springel & hernquist 2005 , springel 2005 ; hopkins 2005a , 2006 ) , the evolution of the statistical properties of agn in a cosmological context has been mainly investigated through sam ( see baugh 2006 for a review ) , which allow a faster spanning of the parameter space compared to n - body simulations .",
    "in fact , they adopt analytic laws to connect the evolution of dark matter ( dm ) haloes collapsed from the primordial density field and their subsequent merging histories ( derived from monte carlo or n - body simulations ) to the physics of baryons inside the haloes , including the gas processes , the star formation and the growth of supermassive black holes ( bhs ) due to gas accretion and merging ( see kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; menci et al . 2003 , 2006 ; croton et al .",

    "these successes allowed the models to provide a cosmological interpretation of the observed luminosity - dependent evolution of agn ( the `` downsizing '' effect ) : on the one hand , the strong evolution of the bright qso population observed in optical surveys ( see richards et al . 2006 ; croom et al .",

    "results from other last - generation semi - analytic models based on merging trees extracted from n - body simulations ( marulli et al .",
    "2008 ) or on monte carlo generated merging trees ( hirschmann et al . 2012 ) confirm the mismatch .",
    "in fact , although the above papers also assume disk instabilities to provide additional triggers , they yield high - redshifts ( @xmath14 ) agn luminosity functions steeper than the observed ones , so that they can not provide a simultaneous fit to both the number density of bright qsos ( measured by the sloan survey ) and the abundance of lower luminosity agns ( detected by from hard x - ray measurements ) , unless tuned , non - canonical assumptions ( like heavy bh seeds , a varying sub - eddington limit , and a halo mass limit ) are adopted ( hirschmann et al . 2012 ) .",
    "the indication is that , when tuned to account for the observed high abundance of low - redshift faint agns and of bright qso at high redshifts , most semi - analytic models based on cdm are characterized by an over prediction of faint agns at @xmath14 .",
    "note however that the possibility that the cdm models of agn evolution may be brought in agreement with the observations by a proper implementation of the baryon physics is still open ; in fact , the agn luminosity functions derived in the cdm semi - analytic model by fanidakis et al . ( 2012 ) have a flatter slope at the faint end as to be consistent with the observations ( including those concerning the x - ray luminosity distributions after their modelling of the fraction of obscured objects ) .",
    "such an over prediction of faint objects , especially at high redshifts , is indeed a common and robust feature of cdm galaxy formation models .",
    "in fact , the latter yield galaxy luminosity function largely exceeding those measured in k - band for @xmath15 ( see cirasuolo et al . 2010 ; henriques et al .",

    "; see also treister et al .",
    "2012 for the relative role of merging and secular processes ) may be at the origin of the mismatch , the dominating point of view is that all models miss some kind of process involved in the complex baryonic physics describing galaxy formation and agn evolution ( see , e.g. , somerville et al .",
    "in particular , models could fail to properly describe the feedback processes such as heating or winds caused by supernovae explosions and uv background , which may be effective in expelling gas in shallow potential wells thus suppressing both star formation and bh growth in low - mass galaxies . in present models the effectiveness of such a solution is limited by the large densities of dm haloes formed at high redshift , which allow for an effective shielding of the inner regions and yield escape velocities larger than the kinetic energy of sn driven winds ( see discussion in lo faro et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the conflicts are rooted in the cdm spectrum assumed by all above cosmological models of galaxy formation and agn evolution .",

    "the effect is stronger at higher redshifts since cdm models predict low - mass galaxies to form mainly at early cosmic times , so that at @xmath110 a substantial fraction of them has been included into larger galaxies ; on the other hand , the ( minor ) fraction of low - mass galaxies collapsed at @xmath110 is characterized by a lower gas densities ( corresponding to lower escape velocities ) and hence by a larger gas depletion due to supernovae feedback , which contributes to flatten the agn luminosity function even in the cdm case .",
    "we expect the above effects to be quite general in interaction - driven scenarios for agn fueling , since the @xmath108 scaling of the destabilized gas ( and of the related bh accretion , see , e.g. , hopkins and quataert 2010 ) results not only from our model ( see eq .",
    "3 ) , but also from aimed hydrodynamical n - body simulations of galaxy merging ( see cox et al .",
    "2008 ) , while the direct scaling of @xmath54 with the galaxy mass is shared by all cosmological models of galaxy formation , as well as the feedback dependence on the escape velocity of galaxies .",
    "note also that - at any redshift - for the luminous qso population the effect of assuming a wdm spectrum is minimal .",
    "in fact , the large accretion rates characterizing such objects require the interactions of massive galaxies with clumps of comparable sizes , whose abundance is not sensibly affected by the small - scale cutoff in the dm power spectrum .",
    "[ 0.64 ]    thus , high - redshift @xmath104 measurements of the abundance of low - luminosity @xmath0 erg / s agn are best suited to discriminate between the cdm and the wdm predictions .",
    "such observations are now within the reach of the recent deep searches . in particular ,",
    "fiore et al .",
    "( 2012 ) exploited the combination of the multicolor catalogues music and ers of the goods south field ( grazian et al .",
    "2006 , 2011 ) with 4 ms chandra images in the 2 - 10 kev x - ray band to obtain the deepest measurements of low - luminosity agn .",
    "they selected faint agn activity among the numerous lyman break galaxies in a wide redshift interval @xmath111 putting interesting constraints on the faint end of the luminosity function at @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , that we show in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "1 . note that such points account for obscured objects , including the compton - thick fraction observed in the sample ( @xmath114 for @xmath16 ) ; fiore et al .",
    "( 2012 ) estimated the uncertainty on the observed luminosity functions due to possibly undetected ( or unaccounted - for ) compton thick sources to be small ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "thus , the x - ray detections make the sample more complete with respect to the optical surveys and this is reflected in the higher densities attained by the fiore et al .",
    "( 2012 ) luminosity functions compared to extrapolations of their optical counterparts to low luminosities ; nevertheless , for @xmath0 erg / s , such number densities are overestimated by our fiducial cdm model by factors up to ten ( in the lowest luminosity bins ) , while they are well matched by the wdm models .",
    "thus , the indications from such deep , high - redshift observations is that the wdm scenario that provides a viable solution to the cdm over - prediction of faint galaxies ( see paper i ) could also provide an interesting framework for the evolution of the agn population , at least in interaction - driven scenarios for the agn triggering . as we shall show in sect .",
    "4 , such a conclusion is quite robust with respect to the choice of the supernovae feedback parameters , the main source of uncertainty at the faint end of the agn luminosity function in semi - analytic models .",
    "finally , we note that the correlation between the galactic and the agn properties is not strongly affected by the shape of the dm power spectrum on small scales .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "2 , where we compare the local black hole - stellar mass relations predicted in the cdm and wdm scenarios with availble data ( details on the comparison are given in lamastra et al .",
    "2010 , where we presented the cdm predictions ) .",
    "the only appreciable difference is the smaller scatter ( for small values of @xmath116 ) in the wdm case , due to the smaller number of interactions with low - mass galaxies , largely affecting the accretion history of low - mass bhs .",
    "the predicted evolution of the bh - stellar mass relation is also weakly dependent on the adopted power spectrum : this is illustrated by the paths showing the growth of bh mass relative to the stellar mass for largest bhs in our monte carlo simulation . as predicted for cdm in our previous work ( see lamastra et al .",
    "2010 ) , the local relation is reached - for massive objects- through paths passing _ above _ the local relation , indicating a faster growth of bh masses compared to stellar masses in the earliest phase of galaxy evolution , in both the cdm and the wdm case .",
    "[ 0.36 ] [ 0.36 ]",
    "in the previous section we have shown that the recent observational estimates of the high - redshift agn luminosity functions are matched by the model predictions in wdm cosmology , due to the suppression of the _ number density _ of low mass galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "it is interesting to investigate whether a similar agreement can be achieved through a proper _ luminosity evolution _ within the standard cdm scenario .",
    "this would require a suppression the agn luminosities for @xmath117 erg / s at redshift @xmath16 .",
    "here we investigate whether increasing the efficiency and the mass dependence of the stellar feedback can help in bringing the cdm predictions in closer agreement with present data on the agn abundance at high redshifts .    to this aim , we modified our fiducial cdm model by maximizing the feedback efficiency at small galaxy masses .",
    "our _ maximal feedback _ model differs from our fiducial case in three respects : i ) the ( inverse ) scaling of the galaxy feedback on the circular velocity is increased from @xmath118 ( see sect .",
    "2.2 ) to @xmath119 ; ii ) the supernovae efficiency is increased to @xmath120 ; iii ) an artificial cutoff for gas cooling is assumed for galaxy haloes with circular velocity larger than @xmath121 km / s ; this mimics the effect of the agn radio mode implemented in several sams to fit the bright end of the local luminosity functions ( the chosen value for the cutoff circular velocity corresponds to that resulting from the analysis of fontanot et al .",
    "although such a point constitutes a critical issue in galaxy formation models , it has a minor influence on the evolution of the low - mass end of the galaxy and agn luminosity functions    such a _ high feedback _ model is similar to other semi - analytic models , like that by guo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) which adopt a similar scaling for the sn feedback .",
    "in fact , it provides an excellent fit to the low - redshift stellar mass distribution and luminosity function ( see fig .",
    "3a , b ) , similar to that provided by our wdm model ; even though it is well known that such high - feedback models in cdm cosmology yield an exceeding fraction of faint red galaxies at low redshift ( see also guo et al .",
    "2011 ; lo faro et al .",
    "2009 ) , we shall investigate such a case to probe the effects of changing the galaxy feedback on the agn evolution , and to bracket the range of cdm predictions corresponding to different sams in the literature ( within the assumption of interaction - triggered agn fueling ) .",
    "the evolution of the agn luminosity functions in the above `` maximal - feedback '' model is shown in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "3 , where we also show for comparison the results for the wdm ( solid line ) and the fiducial cdm model ( dotted ) . note that , while at low redshifts the cdm maximal feedback model provides an excellent match to the data , at redshifts @xmath122 the implementation of a maximal feedback does not seem able to properly match the observed abundance of low - luminosity agn ( those in the faintest bin @xmath123 erg / s ) .",
    "this is due to a twofold reason : i ) the inner density of dm haloes rapidly grows with redshifts , so that for @xmath124 the escape velocity of dm haloes @xmath125 remains large even for low - mass galaxies , and this , in turn , suppresses the feedback efficiency in removing gas from the cold phase . this effect has already been found and discussed by , e.g. , lo faro et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , who found that sams in cdm cosmology over - predict the slope of the low - mass end of the stellar mass distribution at high - redshifts @xmath124 even in the presence of a large feedback efficiency ; this effect is also responsible for the over - prediction of low - mass galaxies at @xmath126 in the sam by guo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) based on the millenium simulation .",
    "ii ) in interaction - driven models for the agn feeding , faint agn at high redshifts are associated to minor - mergers , rather than being produced by gas - poor galaxies ; to reduce the abundance of faint agn with respect to the fiducial cdm case , the suppression of the number density of low - mass galaxies ( and hence of minor mergers ) resulting in wdm cosmology is more efficient than reducing the cold gas fractions by increasing the stellar feedback .",
    "thus , at high redshifts @xmath124 the cdm over - prediction of low - mass galaxies yield by cdm models ( see lo faro et al .",
    "2009 ; guo et al .",
    "2011 ; somerville et al .",
    "2008 ) seems to have a counterpart in an excess of the number of predicted faint agn even assuming a maximal feedback efficiency ; this makes the number density effects of wdm scenario an attractive alternative for all models aiming at providing a unified solution to the different aspects of the cdm over - abundance problem .    [ 0.6 ]",
    "we have shown that the recent measurements of the abundance of low - luminosity ( @xmath127 erg / s ) agn at high redshifts @xmath1 can provide severe constraints to models connecting the agn evolution to galaxy formation through the effects of galaxy interactions .",
    "in particular , the long - standing problem of cdm over - prediction of low - mass galaxies at such high redshifts reflects into a similar excess of low - luminosity agn .",
    "we have shown that the suppression of the number of low - mass galaxies obtained in a wdm model ( with wdm particles of mass @xmath25 kev ) provides a viable solution to both the galactic ( menci et al .",
    "2012 ) and the agn ( this paper ) excess .",
    "we have also shown that solutions to such excess based on increased supernovae feedback are less efficient than the wdm suppression of low - mass galaxies , at least in interaction - driven models for the triggering of agn ; in fact , in such models , faint agn at high redshifts are associated to minor - mergers , rather than being produced by gas - poor galaxies ; to reduce the abundance of faint agn with respect to the fiducial cdm case , the suppression of the number density of low - mass galaxies ( and hence of minor mergers ) resulting in wdm cosmology is more efficient than reducing the cold gas fractions by increasing the stellar feedback .",
    "note however that , when the wdm merging trees are computed with progenitor distributions and halo mass functions strongly suppressed below the free - streaming scale ( as suggested by benson et al .",
    "2013 ) , the low - redshift agn luminosity function under - predicts the observations at low luminosities @xmath128 erg @xmath129 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    while the strongest constraints to distinguish between wdm and cdm models are naturally given by the faint ( @xmath127 erg / s ) end of the agn luminosity function at @xmath1 , faint agn at high - z",
    "is of course the region of the agn parameter space most difficult to probe .",
    "the measurements of the faint end of the agn luminosity function in figs . 1 and 3 are reasonably good at z=3 - 4 , but they are rather loose at z@xmath130 . in particular , as noted by fiore et al .",
    "( 2012 ) the point at z=6 should be regarded as an upper limit to the agn density rather than a determination , being based on just two galaxies , detected in the small ers area within the cdfs region , with rather loosely constrained photometric redshift . as of today",
    "we do not have a single agn at z@xmath131 with a robust spectroscopic redshift .",
    "this poor situation may improve in the next few years . at the flux limits reached by the deepest chandra exposure ( 4 mseconds )",
    "there are several hundreds agn / deg@xmath132 for z@xmath130 , a number @xmath133 agn / deg@xmath132 for z@xmath134 , and @xmath135 agn / deg@xmath132 for z@xmath136 .",
    "it is clear that to obtain a more robust demography of the z@xmath1376 agn a search in a much wider area , such as the candels area ( grogin et al .",
    "2011 ; koekemoer et al .",
    "2011 ) , is mandatory , and requires spectroscopic confirmation of the x - ray emitting , candidate z@xmath131 galaxies .",
    "the candels deep and wide surveys cover a total of 130 arcmin@xmath132 and 670 arcmin@xmath132 to a depth of h=27.8 and h@xmath138 respectively , about 3 times and 12 times the ers area .",
    "the two candidate z@xmath131 ers galaxies detected by chandra in the ers field are faint , h=26.6 and h=27 sources .",
    "the goods source with z@xmath139 in the luo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) catalog has h=27.6 . in summary",
    ", we expect a number @xmath140 agn in the candels deep survey for z@xmath131 and less than @xmath141 agn for z@xmath131 in the candels wide survey .",
    "we note that a fraction of these sources will be at the limit , or below , the h band sensitivity threshold of the wide survey . as of today",
    ", chandra has spent of the order of 8 mseconds on the candels fields , most of them on the candels deep fields . to reach the sensitivity to detect the faint z@xmath131 agn in the wide area , additional 5 - 6",
    "mseconds are needed .",
    "this is within reach of the chandra observatory in the next few years .",
    "note that , our results do not exclude that the cdm predictions for the number low - luminosity agn at high redshifts can be reconciled with observations provided : i ) less luminous agns are driven by secular processes rather than by galaxy interactions ; ii ) additional baryonic physics is involved in the black hole accretion at high redshifts ( especially for low - luminosity agns ) ; iii ) heavy initial bh seeds .",
    "such processes could provide the negative agn luminosity evolution needed to balance the agn excess of standard cdm models .",
    "indeed , some of the above conditions have been explored in recent semi - analytic models . as for the first possibility ( point i ) above ) , both fanidakis et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and hirschmann et al .",
    "( 2012 ) also include disk instabilities as an additional trigger for bh accretion , with the former paper also including accretion at low rates from hot halos .",
    "while such models provide excellent fits to the agn luminosity functions at @xmath142 , at higher redshifts @xmath14 they predict different abundances for low - luminosity agns ; while the predictions shown in fanidakis et al .",
    "( 2012 ) are consistent with observations , the hirschmann et al .",
    "( 2012 ) model overestimates the abundance of faint agns . here the critical issue is the luminosity range where the different accretion modes take over ; in this respect , important hints to improve modelling will be provided by observations relating the agn luminosity with galaxy mergers ( see treister et al . 2012 ) and with giant clumps associated to disk instabilities ( see bournaud et al .",
    "2012 ) as well as by aimed n - body simulations ( see , e.g. , bournaud et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "as for the second and third possibilities ( points ii ) and iii ) above ) , they are still open ; indeed , hirschmann et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have shown that assuming a varying sub - eddington limit ( that depends on the cold gas fraction ) , and heavy bh seeds with a tuned cutoff for the host halo mass can resolve the mismatch . however , while varying sub - eddington limit onto low - mass bhs at high redshifts and heavy bh seeds could solve the cdm excess of predicted low - luminosity agns , they would leave unchanged its over - prediction of low - mass / faint galaxies at high redshifts @xmath16 , which should find a different solution . indeed ,",
    "our results strongly indicate that , when seeking for a unified a solution to the cdm over prediction of low - luminosity agn and of low - mass galaxies at @xmath7 , the wdm cosmology represents an appealing solution .",

    "<S> recent measurements of the abundance of agn with low - luminosities ( @xmath0 erg / s in the 2 - 10 kev energy band ) at high redshifts @xmath1 provide a serious challenge for cold dark matter ( cdm ) models based on interaction - driven fueling of agn . using a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation </S>",
    "<S> we investigate how such observations fit in a warm dark matter ( wdm ) scenario of galaxy formation , and compare the results with those obtained in the standard cdm scenario with different efficiencies for the stellar feedback . taking on our previous exploration of galaxy formation in wdm cosmology , </S>",
    "<S> we assume as a reference case a spectrum which is suppressed - compared to the standard cdm case - below a cut - off scale @xmath2 mpc corresponding ( for thermal relic wdm particles ) to a mass @xmath3 kev . </S>",
    "<S> we run our fiducial semi - analytic model with such a wdm spectrum to derive agn luminosity functions from @xmath4 to the present over a wide range of luminosities ( @xmath5 / erg s@xmath6 in the 2 - 10 kev x - ray band ) , to compare with recent observations and with the results in the cdm case . when compared with the standard cdm case , </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity distributions we obtain assuming a wdm spectrum are characterized by a similar behaviour at low redshift , and by a flatter slope at faint magnitudes for @xmath7 , which provide an excellent fit to present observations . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how such a result compares with cdm models with maximized feedback efficiency , and how future deep agn surveys will allow for a better discrimination between feedback and cosmological effects on the evolution of agn in interaction - driven models for agn fueling . </S>"
