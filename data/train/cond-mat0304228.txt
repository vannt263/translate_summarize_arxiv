    "discrete energy levels show an atomic - like shell structure.@xcite they are filled consecutively with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "when a shell is partly filled , electrons occupy degenerate energy levels with parallel spins ( hund s rule ) , as seen in the periodic table of atoms.@xcite these properties of the artificial atoms have been quantitatively explained by theoretical studies including the electron - electron coulomb interaction exactly.@xcite    compared with the electronic states in gaas quantum dots , those in silicon ( si ) quantum dots have been poorly understood .",

    "particularly , there have been few theoretical studies which consider the effects of a multivalley structure of the conduction band on the electronic states in si quantum dots.@xcite the multivalley structure should lead to different properties of electronic states from those in gaas quantum dots with single valley at @xmath2 point .",
    "recently some experiments of the coulomb oscillation have been reported for si quantum dots.@xcite the magnetic - field dependence of the current peaks indicates various spin states in the quantum dots . another experiment has implied the observation of the kondo effect , which might be due to degenerate energy levels by the multivalley structure of the conduction band.@xcite the explanation for these phenomena requires the understanding of the electronic states in si quantum dots .",

    "high - spin states are easily realized by applying a small magnetic field .",
    "this is quite different from the case of single - valley artificial atoms of gaas quantum dots , where high spins appear due to the exchange interaction only in the case of orbital degeneracy ( hund s rule ) .",

    "electrons are accommodated in a valley , making the highest spin , to gain the exchange energy .",

    "<S> occupy the lowest level in different valleys in the absence of hund s coupling when the dot size is less than 10 nm . </S>",
    "<S> high - spin states are easily realized by applying a small magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) when the dot size is much larger , the electron - electron interaction becomes relevant in determining the electronic states . </S>",
    "<S> electrons are accommodated in a valley , making the highest spin , to gain the exchange energy . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) in the presence of intervalley scattering , degenerate levels in different valleys are split . </S>",
    "<S> this could result in low - spin states . </S>",
    "<S> these spin states in multivalley artificial atoms can be observed by looking at the magnetic - field dependence of peak positions in the coulomb oscillation . </S>"
