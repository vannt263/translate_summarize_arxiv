    "weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) direct detection experiments aim to directly detect non - baryonic dark matter via the elastic scattering of wimps on detector nuclei , and are presently reaching the sensitivity required to detect neutralinos ( the lightest supersymmetric particle and an excellent wimp candidate ) .",
    "the direction dependence of the event rate due to the earth s motion  @xcite provides a powerful wimp ` smoking gun ' ; a directional detector needs only of order ten events to differentiate a wimp signal from isotropic backgrounds  @xcite . designing a detector capable of measuring the directions of sub-100",

    "i  @xcite we studied the number of events required to reject isotropy ( and hence detect a wimp signal ) and reject rotational symmetry ( and detect flattening of the milky way halo ) for a range of observationally motivated halo models , taking into account the detector response .",
    "we also calculated the number of events required to detect a deviation in the mean direction from the direction of solar motion due to a tidal stream .",
    "we found that if the senses ( i.e the signs ) of the recoil vectors are known then of order ten events will be sufficient to distinguish a wimp signal from an isotropic background for all of the halo models considered , with the uncertainties in reconstructing the recoil direction only mildly increasing the required number of events .",
    "if the senses of the recoils are not known then the number of events required is an order of magnitude larger , with a large variation between halo models , and the recoil resolution is now an important factor .",
    "the rotational symmetry test required of order a thousand events to distinguish between spherical and significantly triaxial halos , however a deviation of the peak recoil direction from the direction of the solar motion due to a tidal stream could be detected with of order a hundred events , regardless of whether the sense of the recoils is known . while technologies for 3-d tpc readouts with sufficient resolution to reconstruct sub-100 kev recoils in 3-d exist  @xcite , the cost and technological challenge of scaling these up to large , low background wimp detectors is considerable .",
    "therefore in this paper we repeat our analysis for a detector with less complex 2-d read - out to assess the effects this would have on the detection potential .",

    "the nuclear recoil spectrum depends sensitively on the ( unknown ) local wimp velocity distribution .",
    "observations and simulations of halos indicate that it is likely that the milky way ( mw ) halo is triaxial , anisotropic and contains substructure ( see paper i  @xcite for discussion and references ) and these properties can lead to interesting features in the recoil distribution spectrum  @xcite .",
    "a generic feature of triaxial halo models is a flattening of the recoil distribution towards the galactic plane , so that the recoil distribution is not symmetric about the direction of motion of the sun , @xmath1 .",
    "wimps from a tidal stream , with velocity dispersion small compared with its bulk velocity , produce a recoil distribution peaked in the hemisphere whose pole points in the direction of the stream velocity .",
    "the net ( stream plus smooth background wimp distribution ) peak direction depends on the direction of the stream and the fraction of the local density that it contributes .",
    "we consider three fiducial halo models ( selected from the twelve considered in paper i ) with properties at the extreme / optimistic end of the range of expected properties .",
    "model a ( 1 in paper i ) is the standard halo model , which has a maxwellian local velocity distribution with velocity dispersion equal to @xmath2 . model b ( 3 ) is the logarithmic ellipsoidal model  @xcite , which has a multivariate gaussian velocity distribution , with shape parameters @xmath3 ( corresponding to a density distribution with axis ratios @xmath4 ) and velocity anisotropy @xmath5 .",
    "model c ( 12 ) is the standard halo model plus a tidal stream with bulk velocity , in galactic co - ordinates , @xmath6 and velocity dispersion @xmath7 comprising @xmath8 of the local density  @xcite .",
    "we calculate the recoil distribution for each halo model via monte carlo simulation , as described in section iib of paper i  @xcite  . in a realistic directional detector",
    "it will not be possible to measure the nuclear recoil direction with infinite precision due to multiple scattering and diffusion .",
    "in paper i  @xcite we took these effects into account assuming a tpc detector filled with 0.05 bar cs@xmath9 , a 10 cm drift length over which a uniform drift field of 1@xmath10 was applied and a 200 @xmath11 m 3-d pixel readout .",
    "extending these simulations to determine the angular resolution of a 2-d detector is however complicated ; projection effects combined with multiple scattering of the recoil will make the resolution a function of the primary recoil direction and energy .",
    "we therefore assume a 0.05bar cs@xmath9 tpc detector with a 2-d readout of perfect resolution to provide benchmark figures for the numbers of events required for the detection of a wimp signal with a 2-d detector .",
    "the numbers of events we find will hence be lower limits on the numbers required by a real detector .",

    "we therefore define a cartesian coordinate system fixed in the laboratory in which the x - axis points towards geographic north , the y - axis towards geographic west and the z - axis towards the zenith .",
    "the three simplest possible 2-d read - out planes in this frame are : meridian ( x - z plane ) , horizon ( x - y plane ) and east - west ( y - z plane ) .",
    "we measure 2-d directions by projecting the 3-d recoil vectors into each of these planes and measuring the ( right - handed ) azimuthal angle @xmath16 between the projected vector and the z - axis in the meridian plane , the x - axis in the horizon plane and the z - axis in the east - west plane .",
    "the orientation of the read - out planes also depends on the latitude of the detector .",
    "we focus mainly on a detector at the boulby mine , where the drift detector is currently located , which is at a latitude of @xmath17 n. potential locations are limited by the requirement of a suitable deep underground laboratory ( in order to shield cosmic - ray backgrounds ) .",
    "all of the proposed directional detector locations which we are aware of lie at mid - northern latitudes ( e.g. kamioka , snolab ) . to cover the range of possible locations we also examine detectors located at @xmath18 n ( kamioka ) and @xmath19 n ( sudbury ) .    the distributions of the @xmath16 angles in each plane for each halo model",
    "are generated from the 3-d recoil distributions in the galactic frame by monte carlo simulation of the sidereal time dependent coordinate transform to the detector frame , together with the 2-d projection procedure described above .",
    "the size of the anisotropy will be largest if the maximum in the recoil direction distribution a ) spends as much time as possible close to the read - out plane ( this minimises the spread in the 2-d distribution caused by projection effects ) and b ) has minimal motion in @xmath16 ( this minimises the spread due to time - averaging ) .",
    "for smooth wimp distributions the peak recoil direction is the direction of solar motion and these requirements are fulfilled for any plane whose normal is at @xmath20 to the spin axis of the earth , or equivalently which contains the earth s spin axis ( see also ref .",
    "this is the case for all meridian planes and so the anisotropy should be largest in this plane for any location .    in fig .",
    "[ rawphidist ] we plot the raw 2-d angle distributions for the three benchmark halo models for each read - out plane for a detector located at boulby . for normalisation purposes we have taken the wimp - nucleon cross section and the local wimp density to be @xmath12 and @xmath21 respectively . as expected the peak - to - trough variation is largest in the meridian plane .",
    "the peak - to - trough variation is smallest in the horizon plane as , at boulby , this plane is furthest from the earth s spin axis . the standard halo and standard halo with stream ( models a and c ) have similar peak - to - trough variations , while the triaxial model has a smaller variation ( this is not so obvious from the plot , as the three models have different normalisations , reflecting the different event rates above the @xmath22 threshold ) .",
    "this suggests that it will be hardest to reject isotropy for read out in the horizon plane and/or the triaxial halo model .",
    "the angle distributions at sudbury and kamioka are qualitatively similar with the peak - to - trough variation remaining constant in the meridian plane and increasing ( decreasing ) in the horizon ( east - west ) plane as the detector location is moved south .",
    "a major difference from the 3-d analysis is that here the recoil directions can not be transformed from the lab rest frame to the galactic rest frame . in the 3-d case , the time dependent conversion between the lab and galactic coordinate frames tends to wash out any anisotropies in lab backgrounds so that they are isotropic in the galactic rest frame .",
    "the modulation of the mean recoil direction with sidereal time ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) potentially provides a means of checking the galactic nature of an anisotropic 2-d signal observed in the lab frame . however , determining the mean direction as a function of time necessarily requires large quantities of data .",
    "instead , we use the direction of solar motion projected into each plane , @xmath23 , which is sidereal time - dependent in the lab frame , to calculate the reduced angle , @xmath24 , of each recoil : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the sidereal time at which the recoil occurred . the time - dependent nature of the reduced angle transform means that any anisotropy in lab backgrounds will be washed out to give isotropic reduced angle distributions .    the reduced angle distributions for the three benchmark halo models for a detector located at boulby",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ redphidist ] , and it can be seen that these peak at @xmath27 and have a higher degree of anisotropy compared with the raw distributions in fig .",

    "the reduced angle distributions for model c ( with the tidal stream ) shows significant excesses with respect to the distributions for the two smooth halo models ( at @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the horizon , meridian and east - west planes respectively ) .",
    "the mean reduced angles are @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "the deviation of the mean reduced angle from zero remains zero in the meridian plane and increases ( decreases ) in the horizon ( east - west ) plane as the detector is moved south .",
    "the reduced angle distribution for halo model b has a small asymmetry in the horizon plane at boulby ( the rate at @xmath16 is smaller ( larger ) than that at @xmath34 for @xmath35 ) .",
    "there is a larger deviation from symmetry in the horizon and east - west planes at sudbury and in the horizon plane at kamioka .",
    "the reduced angle distributions in the meridian plane are always symmetric , as this plane is perpendicular to the flattening of the halo .    )",

[ rawphidistaxial ] and [ redphidistaxial ] . the peak - to - trough variations of both the raw and reduced angles are significantly smaller than the corresponding vector angle distributions .",
    "the anisotropy of the raw axial angle distributions are very small and in particular the direction of the stream in model c is such as to produce an almost flat raw angle distribution in the horizon plane .",
    "this is also the case at kamioka in the east - west plane .",
    "as we discussed more extensively in paper i  @xcite a wimp search strategy with a directional detector can be divided into three regimes i ) search ( aiming to detect a non - zero signal ) , ii ) confirmation ( does the signal have the anisotropy expected for a galactic signal ? ) iii ) exploitation ( extraction of information about the local wimp velocity distribution , for instance flattening of the halo or the presence of a tidal stream ) .",
    "we therefore consider three simple hypotheses to test    1",
    ".   is the recoil direction distribution uniform ?",
    "2 .   is the recoil distribution rotationally symmetric about the direction of solar motion ? 3 .",
    "does the mean direction deviate from the direction of solar motion ?    aimed at detecting a wimp signal , flattening of the mw halo and the presence of a stream of wimps respectively .",
    "the recoil directions projected into the read - out plane constitute 2-d vectors , or , if the senses are not known , undirected lines or axes , and so can equivalently be represented as points on a circle , parameterised by their angle relative to some fixed point / direction .",
    "this allows us to use statistical inference methods developed for the analysis of circularly distributed data ( for a review of this extensive field see the standard texts such as refs .",
    "we investigate a variety of non - parametric statistics designed to test the isotropy ( secs .",

    "[ rotsymtest ] ) and mean direction ( sec .",
    "[ dirtest ] ) for the benchmark halo models discussed in sec .",
    "[ recoil ] .",
    "for each halo model and readout plane we calculate the probability distribution of each test statistic , for a given number of events @xmath38 , by monte carlo generating @xmath39 experiments each observing @xmath38 recoils drawn from our calculated @xmath16 distributions .",
    "we then compare this with the null distribution of the statistic , under the assumption of isotropy / rotational symmetry / zero mean reduced angle calculated using analytic expressions where available and otherwise via monte carlo simulation .",
    "specifically we calculate the rejection and acceptance factors , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , for each value of the statistic .",
    "the rejection factor is the probability of measuring a smaller absolute value of the statistic if the null hypothesis is true or equivalently the confidence with which the null hypothesis can be rejected given that measured value of the statistic .",
    "the acceptance is the probability of measuring a larger absolute value of the test statistic if the alternative hypothesis is true or equivalently the fraction of experiments in which the alternative hypothesis is true that measure a larger absolute value of the test statistic and hence reject the null hypothesis at confidence level @xmath40 . clearly a high rejection factor is required to reject the null hypothesis .",
    "we also require a high acceptance , otherwise any one experiment might not be able to reject the null hypothesis at the given rejection factor or the null hypothesis might be erroneously rejected .",
    "we therefore find , using a search by bi - section , the number of events required for @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "for further details on this procedure see appendix c of paper i  @xcite .    with 2-d axial data the conventional ( but not rigorously justified ) procedure is to double the angles of the 2-d vectors and then reduce them modulo @xmath44 ( see sec .",
    "[ intro : a ] and ref .",
    "@xcite ) before applying the statistical tests for circular data .",

    "@xcite , i.e. high density and low velocity dispersion . a lower stream density and/or a higher velocity dispersion would give a peak recoil direction closer to the mean direction of motion of the sun , and make the deviation due to the stream harder to detect .",
    "in general the directional detectability of cold streams of wimps will clearly depend on how much the projection of their bulk velocity into the read - out plane deviates from the projection of the direction of solar motion",
    "we have studied the application of non - parametric tests , developed for the analysis of circular data  @xcite , to the analysis of simulated data as expected from a tpc - based directional wimp detector with 2-d read - out . as the ( energy and direction dependent ) resolution of a 2-d directional detector has not been calculated to date we assume perfect resolution .",
    "our results therefore provide a lower limit on the number of events required with a real detector .",
    "we found that if the senses of the recoils are known then between 10 and 30 events , depending on the read - out plane , will be required to reject isotropy of the reduced ( with the direction of motion of the sun subtracted ) angle distribution .",
    "if the senses are not known then these numbers are increased by roughly an order of magnitude .",
    "these numbers are broadly similar to those for full 3-d read - out . if the isotropy tests are applied to the raw angle distribution , however , these numbers increase significantly ; @xmath48 in the meridian and east - west planes and a factor of 3 in the horizon plane for vectorial data . for axial data",
    "the increase is even larger , at least an order of magnitude . using the reduced angle distribution also has the advantage that the time - dependence of the transformation means that even anisotropic lab backgrounds will have isotropic reduced angle distributions .",
    "it is therefore crucial that recoil events in a detector with 2-d read - out are accurately time stamped and the reduced angles calculated and analysed .",
    "the number of events required is always smallest in the meridian plane , which contains the earth s spin axis , as for this plane the 2-d projection effects which reduce the size of the isotropy are minimised .    after rejecting isotropy",
    "the next step would be to study the direction dependence of the signal and attempt to derive information about the dark matter distribution .",
    "if a significant fraction of the local dark matter distribution is in the form of a cold flow / tidal stream then the peak recoil distribution will deviate from the direction of solar motion , or in other words the mean reduced ( with the direction of solar motion subtracted ) angle will differ from zero .",
    "the size of the mean reduced angle ( and hence the detectability of the stream ) depends on the direction and density of the stream . as an example we consider a stream with bulk velocity , in galactic co - ordinates , @xmath6 comprising @xmath8 of the local density  @xcite .",
    "the number of events required depends on the size of the mean reduced angle and hence the detector location and read out plane . in the meridian plane ( which was best for rejecting isotropy ) the mean reduced angle",
    "is essentially zero , and the stream can not be detected , for all detector locations . for the other read - out planes",
    "the number of events ranges between 500 and @xmath49 . in the horizon ( east - west )",
    "plane the deviation of the mean reduced angle from zero decreases ( increases ) as the detector location is moved south from boulby to kamioka and the number of events required hence increases ( decreases ) .",
    "the number of events required could in theory be reduced by optimising the choice of read - out plane , however in reality this is not feasible due to technical limitations and our lack of knowledge of the underlying wimp distribution .",
    "it is also potentially interesting to look for deviations from rotational symmetry due to either flattening of the milky way halo or the presence of a tidal stream .",
    "unfortunately only a very significant flattening of the milky way halo would be detectable .",
    "a tidal stream could be detected in this way , however the number of events required is larger than for the mean direction test .    in a realistic directional detector",
    "it will not be possible to measure the nuclear recoil direction with infinite precision due to multiple scattering and diffusion . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ recoil ] the angular resolution of a 2-d detector , which will be a function of recoil energy and primary direction due to projection effects , has not yet been calculated .",
    "we have therefore assumed a detector with perfect resolution throughout .",
    "a rough estimate of the likely degradation in performance due to finite resolution can be obtained by examining the fraction of recoils retaining a sufficiently large ( @xmath50 ) fraction of their length after 2-d projection so that their direction can be reconstructed . for the standard halo model @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 of the recoils , in the horizon , meridian and east - west planes respectively , retain @xmath50 of their length .",
    "therefore the numbers of events required for a realistic 2-d detector with finite direction resolution are likely to be at least a factor of order 2 larger than the numbers we obtain .    in summary , we have found that if the sense of the recoils can be measured , then the potential for detecting a wimp signal ( via its anisotropy ) with a detector with 2-d read - out is similar to that for a detector with full 3-d read - out , provided the reduced angle distribution is utilised .",
    "if the senses of the recoils can not be measured then the number of events required to detect the anisotropy of a wimp signal is increased by an order of magnitude , which again is similar to the case of 3-d read out .",
    "we should caution , however , that this comparison assumes a detector with perfect resolution .",
    "the degradation in performance due to the finite resolution of a real detector might be more significant for 2-d read out than for 3-d read out .",
    "a.m.g and b.m are supported by pparc .",
    "2-d vectors are most easily parameterised via their angles @xmath16 ( relative to some arbitrary fiducial direction ) . given a sample of @xmath38 2-d vectors @xmath54 ,",
    "if we define @xmath55 then the resultant length of the sum of the vectors , @xmath40 , is given by @xmath56 and the mean direction @xmath57 can be calculated via @xmath58 adding @xmath59 if @xmath60 and @xmath61 if @xmath62 .      with axial data ( i.e. unsigned lines )",
    "the standard procedure  @xcite is to double the axial angles , reduce them modulo @xmath44 and analyse the resulting vector data .",

    "<S> the direction dependence of the wimp direct detection rate provides a powerful tool for distinguishing a wimp signal from possible backgrounds . </S>",
    "<S> we study the the number of events required to discriminate a wimp signal from an isotropic background for a detector with 2-d read - out using non - parametric circular statistics . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the number of events needed to i ) detect a deviation from rotational symmetry , due to flattening of the milky way halo and ii ) detect a deviation in the mean direction due to a tidal stream . </S>",
    "<S> if the senses of the recoils are measured then of order 20 - 70 events ( depending on the plane of the 2-d read out and the detector location ) will be sufficient to reject isotropy of the raw recoil angles at 90@xmath0 confidence . if the senses can not be measured these number increase by roughly two orders of magnitude ( compared with an increase of one order of magnitude for the case of full 3-d read - out ) . </S>",
    "<S> the distributions of the reduced angles , with the ( time dependent ) direction of solar motion subtracted , are far more anisotropic , however , and if the isotropy tests are applied to these angles then the numbers of events required are similar to the case of 3-d read - out </S>",
    "<S> . a deviation from rotational symmetry will only be detectable if the milky way halo is significantly flattened . </S>",
    "<S> the deviation in the mean direction due to a tidal stream is potentially detectable , however , depending on the density and direction of the stream . the meridian plane ( which contains the earth s spin axis ) is , for all detector locations , the optimum read - out plane for rejecting isotropy . </S>",
    "<S> however read - out in this plane can not be used for detecting flattening of the milky way halo or a stream with direction perpendicular to the galactic plane . in these cases </S>",
    "<S> the optimum read - out plane depends on the detector location . </S>"
