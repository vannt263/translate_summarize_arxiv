    "black hole spacetime is one of the most fascinating objects in gravitational theory . in particular , it is quite interesting that they contain singularities inside of their event horizons . at singularities the spacetime curvature often diverges .",
    "the physics breaks down at singularities because gravitational theory is described in terms of curvature .",
    "observers outside of black holes can not see such breakdown because no information can come out from black holes at least in classical level .",
    "however , black hole singularities may cause serious effects on the observer inside of black hole and/or the final fate of black hole evapolation due to the hawking radiation . here",
    "we define the singularity which is visible for observer inside of black hole , as  locally naked singularity \" .",
    "if a singularity is not wrapped by horizon , it may cause serious effect on physics .",
    "we define that as  globally naked singularity \" .    in order to certify the predictability of physics",
    ", it is very important to ask whether they can be naked or not .",
    "it is usually supposed that no naked singularity will appear in physical situation . in this context , penrose proposed so called cosmic censorship conjecture(ccc ) @xcite .",
    "more precisely , there are two types of ccc , i.e. strong ccc and weak ccc .",
    "strong ccc states that there are no locally naked singularities form during gravitational collapse . and",
    "weak ccc does that there are no globally singularities form during collapse .",
    "the cosmic censorship conjecture is assumed to prove several key theorems on black hole spacetime , such as the event horizon topology theorem , uniqueness theorem and so on ( see @xcite for the details ) .",
    "the conjecture have been investigated by many authors in variety of setups , but it is still controversial . in @xcite , oppenheimer and snyder considered a spherical collapse of homogeneous pressureless fluid , which is called as dust . and they found that no naked singularity form .",
    "but in subsequent works , for example @xcite , many works reported the violation of strong ccc in several situations . in @xcite , christodoulou examined the global nakedness of singularity in four dimensional spacetime .",
    "he considered the spherical collapse of inhomogeneous dust and proved that singularity can be globally naked in some situations , i.e. the violation of weak ccc occurs in general .    motivated by fundamental theory such as string theory ,",
    "those works have been extended to higher dimensional spacetime @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the strong ccc always holds for the spherical collapse of dust cloud with smooth initial data in higher dimensional spacetimes than five , i.e. any observer can not see singularity formed . on the other hand , in general , it was also shown that the strong ccc does not hold in five dimensional spacetimes .    as far as we know , there is no work on a global analysis of collapsing spacetime in _ five _ dimensions .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the weak ccc is actually violated in five dimension . and , if violated , it is important to clarify in what conditions naked singularities form . in this paper",
    "we focus on the analysis of five dimensional inhomogeneous spherically symmetric dust collapse and give a new method to examine the nakedness of singularity .",
    "to do so we have to know whether a causal geodesic emanating from the singularity exists or not .",
    "so , we give a method to investigate the existence of solution of null geodesic equation .",
    "furthermore , we examine the spacetime structure in detail , and give the necessary and sufficient condition for naked singularity formation .",
    "we also examine the condition that the singularity is not only locally naked but also globally naked .",
    "finally , we will see the dependence of the globally nakedness of the singularity on initial density distribution .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we present the settings and the fundamental nature of the inhomogeneous spherically symmetric dust collapse in five dimensional spacetime .",
    "then , we derive the differential equation for null geodesic in terms of dimensionless quantities . in sec . 3",
    ", we examine the existence condition of the solution to the differential equation for null geodesic . by virtue of the schauder fixed - point theorem @xcite",
    ", we show that a solution of the differential equation for null geodesic exist near the singularity .",
    "it means that the singularity can be at least locally naked . in sec . 4",
    ", we analyze the spacetime structure around the singularity .",
    "we identify the earliest null geodesic emanating from the central singularity , and give the necessary and sufficient condition for the singularity to be naked . in sec . 5 , we consider the globally nakedness of the singularity .",
    "we will show that a class of initial density distribution leads to globally naked singularity .",
    "we consider spherically symmetric dust collapse in five dimension .",
    "it is known as ltb solution in higher dimension . in the comoving",
    "coordinate of dust , the metric of this spacetime is written as    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the area radius of the @xmath2 3-sphere and we set @xmath3 by @xmath4 . then , in this coordinate , the einstein equations become @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the energy density of dust , which is proportional to the ricci scalar , @xmath9 is an arbitrary @xmath10 function of @xmath3 and @xmath11 is arbitrary functions of @xmath3 .",
    "dot  @xmath12 \" and prime ",
    "@xmath13 \" mean the partial derivatives with respect to @xmath14 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 corresponds to the total mass in the region surrounded by the @xmath2 surface .",
    "actually @xmath9 is proportional to the misner - sharp quasi - local mass @xcite .",
    "and @xmath11 is the initial energy of dust shell .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , the point where spacetime curvature diverges is singularity . from equation ( [ eq1 ] )",
    ", we can find the two types of singularities , i.e. @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "singularity at @xmath17 and @xmath18 is called shell focusing singularity and shell crossing singularity , respectively .",
    "if we introduce the pressure to the fluid , the shell crossing singularity may disappear .",
    "therefore they are regarded as unphysical singularity . throughout this paper",
    ", we only consider the shell focusing singularity , that is , we assume @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , we also assume that the initial velocity of the shells at @xmath20 is zero , that is , @xmath21 now we can solve the equation ( [ eq2 ] ) as @xmath22 from this equation and ( [ eq1 ] ) , we see that the singularity appears at @xmath23 using equations ( [ metric ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) , we can compute the expansion of outgoing null geodesics on @xmath2 surface @xmath24 as @xmath25 in the second equality , we used the equation @xmath26 which holds for null geodesics along the outer radial direction .",
    "this equation implies that the apparent horizon ( @xmath27 ) is located at @xmath28 .",
    "since we are interested in a naked singularity formation during the dust collapse , we assume that there is no apparent horizon initially .",
    "then , equation ( [ exp ] ) with the setting of @xmath29 tells us that @xmath30 is required for all @xmath3 in this coordinate patch . from equations ( [ metric ] ) , ( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ dofe ] ) , this is equivalent to the condition that @xmath3 is spacelike coordinate .",
    "in addition , from equation ( [ t_r ] ) , we also see that the apparent horizon appears at @xmath31    from equations ( [ ts ] ) and ( [ tah ] ) , if @xmath32 , it is easy to see that @xmath33 holds .",
    "this means that the apparent horizon appears before the singularity does and the singularity is surrounded by the apparent horizon .",
    "so only the singularity at @xmath34 could be naked and another singularities are covered by the event horizon @xcite . in order to examine the possibility of the occurrence of naked singularity",
    ", we assume that the singularity at @xmath34 appears within non - zero finite time @xmath35 , that is , @xmath36 therefore , using a @xmath37 function @xmath38 with @xmath39 , we can write @xmath9 as @xmath40 in the above , @xmath38 corresponds to the mean density for the region surrounded by the @xmath2 shell . from equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ da ] )",

    "then , we see that @xmath38 satisfies means that the absolute value of function @xmath47 is bounded by constant times @xmath48 as @xmath49 , i.e there exist a positive @xmath50 and @xmath51 in @xmath52 such that @xmath53 holds for all @xmath54 $ ] . ]",
    "@xmath55 near @xmath34 and @xmath56 where @xmath57 are parameters satisfying @xmath58 .",
    "using @xmath38 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are rewritten as @xmath61 @xmath62    if @xmath63 in equation ( [ acondition1 ] ) , we can immediately show that central singularity must be covered by apparent horizon .    [ t1 ] if @xmath63 , the strong cosmic censorship holds .",
    "[ t1 ] @xmath63 implies @xmath64 then , @xmath65 thus , there exists @xmath66 such that @xmath67 holes for arbitrary @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "therefore , there exists apparent horizon around the past of central singularity .",
    "so null geodesics can not emanate from the singularity and the strong cosmic censorship holds .",
    "this fact is already known in refs .",
    "@xcite . accordingly , in order to figure out the condition for the naked singularity formation , we suppose @xmath69 in the following discussion .",
    "let us consider the future directed null geodesics along the outer radial direction .",
    "because of spherical symmetry , the differential equation for future directed null geodesics along the outer radial direction is given by @xmath70 we used equation ( [ metric ] ) in the first line , equations ( [ eq3 ] ) , ( [ dofe ] ) and ( [ da ] ) in the second line and the explicit expression of @xmath71 derived from equation ( [ t_r ] ) in the third one .    now , we introduce the dimensionless functions and parameters to write equation ( [ nulleq_0 ] ) in the dimensionless form .",

    "these conditions imply that @xmath72 is written as @xmath77 using @xmath72 , we write @xmath38 as @xmath78 we can easily show that this @xmath38 satisfies the conditions ( [ acondition1 ] ) and ( [ acondition2 ] ) . in the above , @xmath79 and @xmath80",

    "if this equation has a solution which starts from @xmath89 , then , at least , singularity is locally naked .",
    "moreover , if the solution could extend to @xmath90 , the singularity would be visible at null infinity , that is , it is globally naked . from now on we will ask if this differential equation has a solution . for the convenience ,",
