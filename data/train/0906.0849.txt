    "when galaxies merge , it is expected that their central supermassive black holes will form a binary which will also eventually merge via the emission of gravitational radiation @xcite .",
    "the process by which the orbit of the two black holes shrinks to the point at which gravitational radiation is effective in producing a merger within a hubble time is not currently understood ( dubbed the `` final parsec problem '' ; e.g. , @xcite ) , and the observational signatures of such systems have proved to be elusive .    boroson & lauer ( 2009 ; hereafter bl09 ) recently identified a candidate sub - parsec binary supermassive black hole system which could potentially merge in less than a hubble time .",
    "they searched the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) quasar spectra and identified the object sdss j153636.33 + 044127.0 ( hereafter sdss  j1536 + 0441 ) as one of two low - redshift ( @xmath4 ) quasars exhibiting components having multiple redshifts .",
    "the key features of the system are two components of the broad emission lines separated by @xmath5  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "they interpreted these to be the result of broad - line regions around a pair of black holes with masses of 10@xmath6 and 10@xmath7 m@xmath8 , with the relative velocity being a result of the orbital motion in a binary having a sub - parsec semimajor axis with a period of @xmath0100 years .",
    "the night after the bl09  publication came to our attention , we obtained palomar spectra and identified a third velocity component of the broad emission lines @xcite .",
    "this led us to conclude that sdss  j1536 + 0441  was instead an unusual member of the class of agns known as `` double - peaked emitters '' ( e.g. , halpern & filippenko 1988 ; eracleous & halpern 1994 ; strateva et al .",
    "2003 ) , a suggestion that was later made independently by @xcite .",
    "radio observations by @xcite led those authors to suggest a third possibility : that of a quasar pair",
    ". they identified two radio sources separated by 0@xmath397 in very large array ( vla ) observations of sdss  j1536 + 0441 .",
    "subsequently , @xcite found that the two radio sources were coincident with a pair of @xmath9-band sources that they suggested were members of a @xmath05  kpc quasar pair . as we completed this work , a second preprint by lauer & boroson ( 2009 ; hereafter lb09 ) appeared .",
    "they presented _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ images confirming the double nature of the optical source , but they also argued that the optical data were inconsistent with a double - quasar hypothesis .    in  2 of this letter , we present the palomar spectra that led to our initial identification of this source as a double - peaked emitter , as well as additional high - quality keck spectra .",
    "we set upper limits on the long - term evolution of velocity shifts of the broad peaks and on any spatial offset of the emission regions in  3 .",
    "we then argue (  4 ) that the double - peaked emitter nature of this object provides a better explanation than the alternatives .",
    "lb09  reached similar conclusions , so we compare with their results where appropriate and highlight our differences .",
    "our initial spectroscopy was performed using the double spectrograph on the palomar 5-m hale telescope @xcite ; two 600  s exposures were obtained on 2009 march 7.52 ut . the blue - side ( 31505700   ) observations we present here had a spectral resolution of @xmath06    from the combination of a 1@xmath35 slit and the 300/3990 grating . in addition , we obtained a pair of 600  s observations with the echellette spectrograph and imager ( esi ; sheinis et al .",
    "2002 ) on the keck  ii 10-m telescope on 2009 march 22.64 ut .",
    "the 0@xmath375 slit was used , giving a resolution of @xmath045  km  s@xmath2  over the range 400010,200   .",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) images were processed and the spectra were extracted using standard routines in iraf .",
    "our own idl routines were used to flux calibrate the individual esi echellette orders and remove telluric absorption features , as well as to combine the individual orders together over their overlap regions to make the final spectrum .",
    "the wavelength scale was established using comparison - lamp spectra , with small shifts ( @xmath10   ) of the zeropoints of the wavelength scales found by cross correlating the night - sky lines in the object observations against reference - sky spectra .",
    "the flux level of the first esi observation was scaled up by 15% to match the second before combining them , under the assumption that the first was affected by clouds or poor guiding .",
    "both of our spectra reveal that sdss  j1536 + 0441  has unusual broad - line profiles ( see fig .",
    "[ compfig ] ) , as initially described by bl09 .",
    "the balmer lines have a multi - peaked structure , with one peak having the same redshift as the narrow nebular emission lines ( @xmath11 ) and a second one blueshifted by @xmath5 km  s@xmath2  relative to the first .",
    "we follow bl09  by referring to these as the `` r - system '' and `` b - system , '' respectively",
    ". however , as we first noted @xcite , the h@xmath12  line shows a clear third component , visible as a shoulder or hump present at a velocity of @xmath04000  km  s@xmath2relative to the r - system , almost symmetrically opposite in velocity space from the b - system .",
    "the third component is also present in the h@xmath13  profile , but it is partially hidden by the superposed [ ] @xmath14 emission line . although the broad @xmath15 line is contaminated by superposed narrow and absorption lines as well as broad emission , it too shows a boxy profile with the `` corners '' of the box at the same velocity as the b - system and the third component .",
    "no features due to starlight in the host galaxy are seen in the spectra , but absorption lines from several common interstellar species ( , , , and ) are present at a redshift intermediate between the b and r - systems ( @xmath16 ) , as identified by bl09 . our esi spectrum , which includes only the and lines , resolves those absorptions ( full widths at half maximum @xmath17 100  km  s@xmath2  and 170  km  s@xmath2 , respectively ) .",
    "weaker ( rest - frame equivalent width @xmath17 0.16   ) absorption from d2 is also present at @xmath18 , close to the redshift of the r - system , and is likely due to the host galaxy ( d1 at this redshift is blended with d2 of the stronger absorption system ) .",
    "the stronger absorption system is therefore blueshifted by 220 km  s@xmath2  relative to the narrow emission lines , possibly analogous to the blueshifted low - ionization ultraviolet ( uv ) absorber seen in the prototypical double - peaked emitter , arp 102b @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to examine the line profiles of sdss  j1536 + 0441  in more detail , both to investigate potential line - profile variations and velocity shifts of emission components . in figure",
    "[ sdssfig ] , we have plotted a comparison of the balmer - line profiles in the sdss and esi spectra . the original sdss spectrum did not cover the full h@xmath12  profile , explaining why bl09  could not have identified the third component .",
    "the spectra are very similar , with the biggest difference being the @xmath010% higher peaks associated with the b - system in the newer spectrum .",
    "this increase in the ratio of the peak fluxes of the b - system to the r - system is seen consistently in h@xmath12 , h@xmath13 , and h@xmath19 .",
    "the lower - left panel of figure  [ sdssfig ] also shows a comparison of the blue and red halves of the h@xmath12  profile in our esi spectrum .",
    "there is perhaps some excess flux at high velocities on the blue side relative to the red half of the line , but the overall shape of the wings ( @xmath20  km  s@xmath2 ) is similar on both sides . the big difference between the two halves is the emission peak at @xmath21  km  s@xmath2  associated with the b - system , which is at a very similar velocity ( but with the opposite sign ) as the shoulder on the red side .",
    "a potential explanation is that the b - system and the third component represent velocity flows in the broad - line region that are projected onto our line of sight in opposite directions ( possibly due to rotation or outflows ) .",
    "the binary black hole interpretation lacks a natural explanation for both the existence of the third component and its presence at an opposite velocity from the b - system .",
    "one explicit prediction of the binary black hole hypothesis made by bl09  is that the system might show noticeable velocity shifts due to the relative orbital motion of the two components of order 100  km  s@xmath2  yr@xmath2 .",
    "our esi spectrum was taken 0.95 yr after the sdss spectrum , so such a velocity shift should be easily measurable .",
    "we experimented with several methods to find a robust method of determining line peaks without being sensitive to assumptions about the line profile .",
    "we settled on a procedure where we iteratively fit a quadratic function to each line peak and then fit a quadratic to the region of @xmath22  km  s@xmath2  around the preliminary peak location .",
    "the two spectra were fit in an identical manner .",
    "the differences between the peak wavelengths in the sdss and esi spectra were then converted to velocity shifts and are listed in table  [ velstab ] .",
    "gaussian fits to the peaks gave similar results for the shifts .",
    "the two spectra have very consistent wavelength scales , as demonstrated by the 2.8  km  s@xmath2  shift between the [ ] lines in the two spectra .",
    "our esi spectrum has a high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) and velocity resolution , so the errors are dominated by the s / n of the sdss spectrum , as demonstrated by the substantially smaller errors in fitting the bright [ ] line .",
    "the weighted average values for the velocity change of the b and r - systems ( as measured from the h@xmath12  and h@xmath13  lines ) are @xmath23  km  s@xmath2  yr@xmath2  and @xmath24  km  s@xmath2  yr@xmath2 , respectively , in the rest frame of the object .",
    "we can therefore set a 3@xmath25 limit on any velocity shift of the underlying emission regions of @xmath2670  km  s@xmath2  yr@xmath2 .",
    "lc @xmath275007 r - system & -2.8 @xmath28 2.5 + h@xmath13 r - system & 13 @xmath28 18 + h@xmath12 r - system & 4.8 @xmath28 27 + h@xmath13 b - system & 4.8 @xmath28 22 + h@xmath12 b - system & -19 @xmath28 15 + [ velstab ]    @xcite observed sdss  j1536 + 0441  with the vla and discovered a pair of radio sources with 0@xmath397 separation ( named a and b ) .",
    "decarli et al .",
    "( 2009a , b ) and",
    "lb09  found @xmath9-band and optical sources coincident with both the a and b radio components . one possible interpretation of these results is that the a and b radio sources can be identified with the b and r - systems seen in the optical spectra , making this source a double quasar with a @xmath05  kpc separation . with a fiber size of 3@xmath29 in diameter ,",
    "both systems would have naturally fallen within the single spectrum obtained by sdss . at the time of our esi observations , we were unaware of the radio results of @xcite and so did not orient the spectrographic slit along the vector separating the a+b radio sources ( pa=88@xmath30 ) . instead",
    ", our slit was aligned with the parallactic angle ( filippenko 1982 ; pa=48@xmath30).we also do not know for certain the exact position of the slit on the sky relative to the two components . whether the slit was centered on the bright optical source corresponding to the a source or somewhere between the a and b sources",
    ", one would expect an easily measurable spatial offset between the b and r - systems of 0@xmath37 projected along the spatial direction of the slit if they were associated with the a and b sources .",
    "the echelle orders of esi are highly curved relative to the ccd columns , so we used the trace of our bright standard star to rectify each order .",
    "we summed the counts in the 2d ccd frame in several wavelength intervals corresponding to the three velocity components of the broad emission lines , as well as the narrow [ ] @xmath31 line and the surrounding continuum .",
    "the results for the esi orders containing h@xmath12  and h@xmath13  are plotted in figure  [ offsetsfig ] .    as can be seen from figure  [ offsetsfig ] ,",
    "the spatial profiles are almost identical at all wavelengths along the slit .",
    "we fit gaussians to the spatial profiles and found the centroids to be essentially coincident .",
    "the maximum and minimum slit positions across the h@xmath12  and h@xmath13  line profiles are equal to better than 0.1 esi spatial pixel ( @xmath32 ) , which is highly inconsistent with a 0@xmath37 projected separation .",
    "therefore , we reject the double - quasar hypothesis .",
    "lb09  obtained a similar constraint on the basis of observations taken with the slit aligned along a more optimal position angle and also presented photometric evidence that the b source is associated with an early - type galaxy .",
    "agns with double - peaked broad emission lines have been known for many years as a relatively rare subclass of agns .",
    "systematic surveys of radio galaxies @xcite and the sdss quasar sample @xcite have found numerous members of the class .",
    "the most plausible current explanation for the displaced red and blue peaks for most objects in this class involves rotational motion in a relativistic accretion disk @xcite , possibly with some emission component originating in a wind being driven from the surface of the disk @xcite .",
    "some double - peaked emitters observed in the past have been proposed to be candidate binary black hole systems @xcite , much like sdss  j1536 + 0441 .",
    "however , that interpretation has been ruled out in well - studied systems such as arp 102b , 3c  390.3 , and 3c  332 by the lack of appropriate long - term velocity evolution of the peaks @xcite .",
    "bl09  proposed that the observable velocity evolution would be a test of their black hole binary hypothesis . while the observed upper limits (  3 ; lb09 ) to the velocity evolution constrain the allowed orbital parameters for a potential binary ( explored in detail by lb09 ) , we caution that small velocity shifts of the line peaks may even be expected in the double - peaked emitter scenario .",
    "the objects studied by @xcite did show significant velocity evolution , but in a manner that was inconsistent with orbital motion .",
    "the origin of these variations is still not well understood @xcite .",
    "the full widths at half maximum and at quarter maximum for h@xmath12  in sdss  j1536 + 0441  ( relative to the maximum flux in the central peak ) are 8700 and 11,500 km  s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "these values are almost identical to the mean values of 8852 and 11,702 km  s@xmath2  found by @xcite for their optically selected double - peaked emitter sample from sdss , and are significantly larger than those of their reference sample of normal quasars .",
    "the [ ] @xmath275007 flux in the esi spectrum is within 2% of that in the sdss spectrum , showing excellent agreement of the absolute flux scales despite the very different aperture sizes ( the @xmath275007 emission region appears to be spatially unresolved ; fig .",
    "[ offsetsfig ] ) .",
    "the total continuum - subtracted h@xmath12  flux over the velocity range @xmath33 km  s@xmath2  is 1.6 @xmath34 10@xmath35 ergs @xmath36 s@xmath2 , or @xmath37 ergs s@xmath2 ( assuming a flat @xmath38cdm cosmology with @xmath39 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 ; dunkley et al .",
    "this value is higher than any of the double - peaked emitters from the sample of @xcite , but is exceeded by a few of the radio - selected objects of @xcite , indicative of the extreme nature of sdss  j1536 + 0441 .",
    "in addition , the low - ionization narrow emission lines have lower rest - frame equivalent widths ( @xmath00.7    for [ ] @xmath276300 ) than most double - peaked emitters in the literature @xcite .",
    "lb09  compared sdss  j1536 + 0441  with several objects from the literature , identifying three differences between sdss  j1536 + 0441  and the majority of double - peaked emitters .",
    "two of these differences are the relative strengths and shapes of the central and blue peaks seen in sdss  j1536 + 0441  compared to the other objects .",
    "double - peaked emitters are rather heterogeneous as a class @xcite , and we suggest that sdss  j1536 + 0441  is an extreme example .",
    "the third difference noted by lb09was the lack of change in the intensity of the blue peak over a one - year baseline seen in their kitt peak spectrum .",
    "however , in our data ( fig .",
    "[ sdssfig ] ) the blue peak has increased in flux by @xmath010% in both h@xmath12  and h@xmath13 .",
    "we demonstrated in  3 that the broad emission components of sdss  j1536 + 0441  were spatially coincident , ruling out the double - quasar hypothesis suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we believe the preponderance of evidence is in favor of interpreting sdss  j1536 + 0441  as an unusual double - peaked emitter , not the binary black hole originally suggested by bl09 .",
    "lb09  have reached similar conclusions about the nature of this system , but do not yet rule out the binary hypothesis . as a phenomenological matter , sdss  j1536 + 0441  clearly shows multi - peaked emission - line profiles like other members of the class of double - peaked emitters .",
    "we can not conclusively disprove the binary black hole hypothesis , but feel that there is no compelling reason to adopt a binary interpretation when sdss  j1536 + 0441  shows characteristics of a previously known class of objects probably unrelated to binaries .",
    "sdss  j1536 + 0441  certainly exhibits a few extreme properties for a double - peaked emitter .",
    "the optical luminosity is very high , as is the ratio of the blue to red peaks . @xcite",
    "modeled the balmer line profiles in the keck data presented here and found that a standard disk model could reproduce the third component and a shelf of emission under the peak associated with the b - system .",
    "however , their disk models alone could not reproduce the sharp blue peak , so another component was required , which they proposed was due to a broad - line region around a secondary black hole in the accretion disk .",
    "we note that a significant fraction of the other known double - peaked emitters are also not well fit in detail by simple disk models , either , possibly indicating the presence of an additional emission component or non - axisymmetric disks @xcite .    instead of waiting for several years to further refine the constraints on the lack of orbital motion in the system as suggested by lb09",
    ", we note that there is potentially a simple test that can be done more quickly . now that _",
    "hst _ has been refurbished , it will be possible to obtain uv spectroscopy .",
    "uv observations of other double - peaked emitters have shown that the emission lines from high - ionization material ( e.g. , ly  @xmath12 and ) frequently lack double - peaked velocity profiles @xcite .",
    "this striking difference between the profiles of different lines has been attributed to density and radiative - transfer effects in the multiple line - emitting regions ( e.g. , the accretion disk and associated wind ) .",
    "the absence of multiple velocity peaks in the uv emission lines would be strong evidence in favor of sdss  j1536 + 0441  being a member of the class of double - peaked emitters ; the presence of multiple peaks , however , would still render the interpretation ambiguous .",
    "uv spectra may also clarify the nature of the strong blueshifted absorption system .",
    "the high spatial resolution of _ hst _ spectra could also be used to obtain separate spectra of both the a and b sources to conclusively establish the origin of the three components . likewise , spatially resolved spectra of the paschen lines in the infrared ( using adaptive optics from the ground , for instance ) should be fruitful . in either case , we expect such observations to reveal that either a or b ( but not both ) would be associated with the broad emission - line profiles .",
