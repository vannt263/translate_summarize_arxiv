    "gravitational instability ( gi ) plays a crucial role in structure formation in various astronomical situations ranging from growth of primordial density fluctuations to star formation in disk galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "gi in flattened systems is of particular importance in formation of giant clouds in disk galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , gas giant planets in protoplanetary disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and bound clumps resulting from fragmentation of shocked layers in star - forming regions ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ".    while real astrophysical disks are vertically stratified , most analytic studies often neglect the vertical degree of freedom and adopt an isothermal equation of state ( eos ) for simplicity . in a rotating , infinitesimally - thin disk with surface density @xmath1 and sound speed @xmath2 , the local dispersion relation for axisymmetric waves with frequency @xmath3 and wavenumber @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the epicycle frequency and @xmath7 is the gravitational constant ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if the disk is not rotating , sound waves with @xmath8 would become gravitationally unstable .",
    "the coriolis force arising from disk rotation stabilizes long - wavelength perturbations , making the disk jeans - stable if the toomre stability parameter satisfies @xmath9 for any @xmath4 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . when @xmath10 , on the other hand , thermal pressure and rotation are unable to stop the collapse of over - dense regions",
    ".    the thin - disk approximation would be valid as long as vertical motions are unimportant and the scale of interest is much longer than the disk scale height .",
    "nevertheless , it has been well known that finite disk thickness makes some quantitative changes to the characteristic wavelengths and critical @xmath11 values .",
    "for instance , @xcite showed that waves in self - gravitating , non - rotating , isothermal disks with scale height @xmath12 become unstable if @xmath13 , which can be compared with the unstable condition @xmath14 of the razor - thin counterpart ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "for rotating disks , @xcite considered the effect of the finite disk thickness and found that the stability condition changes to @xmath15 .",
    "this decrease of the critical @xmath11 value is due to the dilution of self - gravity at the disk midplane in a vertically stratified disk , which can approximately be treated by multiplying the gravity reduction factor @xmath16 to the second term of the right - hand - side of equation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the results of gi in isothermal disks are informative , there are several issues of gi that need clarification in more general situations .",
    "first of all , there are many classes of gaseous disks that do not have constant temperature in the vertical direction .",
    "examples include optically thick regions of planet - forming protoplanetary disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) and accretion disks around compact objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these disks have often been modeled using a polytropic eos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while behavior of various waves in polytropic disks have been studied extensively ( e.g. , @xcite ) , gi of such disks has not been explored in detail .",
    "@xcite calculated a stability criterion of a uniformly - rotating polytropic disk , but was limited to the case with the adiabatic index @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite studied gi of polytropic disks with arbitrary @xmath18 by using approximate scaling relations instead of solving perturbation equations accurately .",
    "recently , @xcite considered vertically - stratified polytropic disks and argued that inertial modes rather than acoustic modes become unstable to self - gravitating perturbations . in this work",
    ", we shall clarify using both analytic and numerical approaches that it is the acoustic modes rather than the inertial modes that become unstable .",
    "second , since the sound speed varies with height in polytropic disks , it is questionable what kind of average is the most appropriate for @xmath2 if one wants to use the stability condition .",
    "several numerical studies used the vertically - averaged sound speed @xcite or simply midplane value @xcite to evaluate stability of protoplanetary disks , but the usage of these has yet to be justified .",
    "@xcite attempted to resolve this ambiguity by introducing @xmath19 as a three - dimensional stability parameter , where @xmath20 is the local orbital angular velocity and @xmath21 is the midplane density , but the connection between @xmath22 and @xmath11 is uncertain since the former does not depend on @xmath2 explicitly . in this work",
    ", we define the effective sound speed that well represents the modal behavior of acoustic waves in a thermally stratified disk and show that this naturally relates @xmath11 to @xmath22 .",
    "the third issue involves disk truncation by external pressure .",
    "galactic disks are confined by ram pressure of infalling gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) or hot halo gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thin shells produced by supernovae , stellar winds , or expanding regions are usually bounded by shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that pressure - confined disks become unstable at scales smaller than the jeans wavelength @xmath23 of unbounded disks .",
    "the mass of fragments produced by such gi is less than the critical bonnor - ebert mass , and thus may not necessarily experience gravitational runaway .",
    "when the confining pressure is very strong , @xcite showed that the gi becomes essentially the same as that of an incompressible disk , which is in stark contrast to the conventional jeans instability of compressional disks . @xcite and @xcite confirmed such predictions by using numerical simulations .",
    "@xcite suggested the gi of strongly confined disks as a potential candidate for forming `` free - floating '' planetary - mass objects ( having mass as low as @xmath24 ) detected in young star clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "more elaborate theoretical and numerical models including the effects of shell expansion and deceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thermal and chemical processes @xcite , boundary conditions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , magnetic fields @xcite , etc .  examined consequences of gi occurring under high external pressure .    despite these efforts",
    ", however , the physical mechanism behind the gi of strongly pressure - confined disks still remains controversial .",
    "for example , @xcite argued that the instability is due to a neutral mode that exists because external pressure can hold the layer to any distorted shape , while @xcite and @xcite claimed that the distortion of the surfaces exerts a pinching force that causes the distorted disk to collapse . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite considered the collapse of an oblate spheroid with uniform density pressurized by an ambient medium ( see also @xcite ) , and termed the enhanced gi `` pressure - assisted gravitational instability '' , although the physical processes responsible for it were not identified .",
    "very recently , @xcite studied gi of pressure - confined shells around expanding regions taking into account boundary effects .",
    "they suggested from the vertical behaviors of eigenfunctions that the restoring force of the unstable mode comes from surface - gravity waves .",
    "we use both numerical and analytic approaches to confirm that it is indeed surface - gravity waves that become unstable in strongly confined disks .    in this paper , we investigate gi of rotating , vertically - stratified , pressure - confined gas disks .",
    "we adopt simple polytropic , rotating models of @xcite and extend them to pressure - confined situations .",
    "this work also extends the case of non - rotating , isothermal models of @xcite to rotating , polytropic disks .",
    "our objectives are four - fold .",
    "first , we wish to distinguish conventional jeans instability from the gi arising from the surface distortion of strongly pressure - confined disks , and give a clear physical explanation for the latter that has previously been confusing .",
    "second , we provide analytic expressions for the effective sound speed @xmath0 that best represents the modal behavior of sound waves in polytropic disks .",
    "third , we find the gravity reduction factors caused by finite disk thickness for the jeans and distortional modes of gi .",
    "we show that the numerical dispersion relations found by solving a full set of perturbation equations are well matched by equation provided that @xmath2 is changed to @xmath0 and that the appropriate reduction factor is considered in the gravity term .",
    "finally , we generalize the toomre stability parameter of razor - thin disks to vertically - stratified , pressure - bounded disks .",
    "while our disk models are simple with a polytropic eos and without considering external gravity , some qualitative properties of gi clarified in this paper can hold true in more general situations such as disks with a barotropic eos and/or with external gravity .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : basic ]",
    ", we introduce basic equations , construct an equilibrium model , and present linearized perturbation equations . in section [ sec : fun ] , we derive expressions for the effective sound speed @xmath0 that describe the phase speeds of fundamental modes in non - self - gravitating , non - rotating disks . in section [ sec : gi ] , we present the gravity reduction factors @xmath25 , and show that an approximate dispersion relation using @xmath0 and @xmath25 is in excellent agreement with the numerical results obtained by solving the perturbation equations . for rotating disks , we define a stability parameter using @xmath0 that is applicable also to the distortional mode . in section [ sec : discuss ] , we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "we consider a rotating , self - gravitating , gaseous disk in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium and analyze its stability to small - amplitude , axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "the disk is infinitely extended in the horizontal direction , but truncated at a finite height by a tenuous external medium with pressure @xmath26 . for local modes in the horizontal direction , it is advantageous to consider a local cartesian reference frame whose center lies at a radius @xmath27 and orbits the disk center with a fixed angular velocity @xmath28 . in this local frame ,",
    "radial , azimuthal , and vertical coordinates are represented by @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , respectively , and the terms arising from curvature effect are ignored ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "assuming that the shear rate @xmath32 is uniform , the equilibrium background velocity field is given by @xmath33 and the local epicyclic frequency is @xmath34 .",
    "the equations of ideal hydrodynamics expanded in the local frame are @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 denote mass density , velocity , thermal pressure , and self - gravitational potential of the gas , respectively . to close the set of equations - , we assume that the gas follows a polytropic eos @xmath42 where @xmath43 is an arbitrary constant and @xmath18 is the polytropic exponent . if @xmath18 is different from an adiabatic exponent of disturbances , the system under consideration exhibits complicated modal behaviors associated with convective motions .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the convective modes do not affect the properties of gi much . in this work ,",
    "we thus simply take @xmath18 equal to the adiabatic exponent .",
    "we first explore equilibrium profiles of density and temperature in purely self - gravitating , polytropic disks confined by an external medium . the pressure confinement model we adopt",
    "is a straightforward extension of isothermal disks studied by @xcite to polytropic cases . for hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction ,",
    "equations ( [ eq : mom ] ) and ( [ eq : poi ] ) require @xmath44 @xmath45 where the subscript `` 0 '' denotes the unperturbed state .",
    "following @xcite , it is convenient to convert the vertical coordinate @xmath31 to the dimensionless variable @xmath46 defined by @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the disk scale height @xmath50 in appendix [ app : ini ] , we show that equations ( [ eq : hse1 ] ) and ( [ eq : hse2 ] ) subject to the symmetry condition @xmath51 at @xmath52 yield the solution @xmath53 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding local speed of sound is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the midplane sound speed .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] plots equilibrium structures of self - gravitating polytropic disks with differing @xmath18 . for a softer eos ( smaller @xmath18 )",
    ", mass density falls off more rapidly from the midplane to provide the pressure support against the gravity @xmath56 at @xmath57 .",
    "this in turn makes the gravity smaller at high - altitude regions , causing the density to decrease slower with height at @xmath58 . as @xmath18 increases",
    ", therefore , the density becomes more concentrated toward the midplane . for @xmath59 ,",
    "equation implies that the density becomes automatically zero at finite height @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the gamma function , indicating that disks with @xmath59 are truncated even without external pressure .",
    "the sound speed in a disk with @xmath59 decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath31 .",
    "note that @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "now we allow for the truncation of a disk at height @xmath64 due to an external pressure @xmath26 .",
    "the condition of pressure equilibrium at the boundaries requires @xmath65 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . using equation ,",
    "the column density of the bounded layer is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the effective half - thickness of the layer .",
    "the relative density drop at the boundaries is @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "note that @xmath70 when @xmath71 , corresponding to no pressure truncation .",
    "as @xmath26 increases , the vertical sound crossing time ( @xmath72 ) becomes smaller than the internal free - fall time ( @xmath73 ) . in the limit of @xmath74 ,",
    "the disk takes uniform density and @xmath75 regardless of @xmath18 : in this case , self - gravity is so weak that the initial equilibrium is maintained by balance between @xmath26 and @xmath76 .",
    "we apply small - amplitude perturbations to the initial equilibrium configurations described above .",
    "are linearized to @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 where the subscript `` 1 '' indicates the perturbed quantities .",
    "we further assume that perturbations are axisymmetric and of plane - wave type @xmath80 where @xmath81 refers to any perturbed variable with frequency @xmath3 and radial wavenumber @xmath82 .",
    "then , equations  can be reduced to four first - order ordinary differential equations @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the vertical lagrangian displacement defined through @xmath85 , @xmath86 is the perturbed enthalpy , and @xmath87 .",
    "we take @xmath84 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 as four independent variables .",
    "the set of the perturbation equations ( [ eq : per_a])([eq : per_d ] ) are to be integrated numerically along the vertical direction to yield a dispersion relation @xmath91 that satisfies the boundary conditions ( bcs ) as well as the constraints of even - symmetry modes . to separate the distortional modes of gi from the conventional jeans modes , we consider two distinct conditions at the boundaries : the rigid boundary that allows only the jeans modes and the free boundary in which jeans and distortional modes coexist .",
    "appendix [ app : bc ] describes the bcs we adopt .",
    "appendix [ app : num ] presents the numerical method we follow to obtain full dispersion relations , which will be compared with approximate dispersion relations in sections [ sec : fun ] and [ sec : gi ] .    for future purposes",
    ", we note that the total perturbed density @xmath92 is a superposition of the perturbed density @xmath93 inside the disk due to wave motions and the perturbed density @xmath94 at @xmath64 due to the surface distortion : @xmath95 where @xmath96 for even - symmetry modes . here , @xmath97 is the dirac delta function .",
    "the corresponding perturbations in the surface density can be written as @xmath98 .",
    "we define @xmath99 as the fraction of the perturbed surface density inside the disk relative to the total perturbed surface density .",
    "we will show that @xmath100 defined in equation is a key parameter that controls the relative importance of the jeans modes to the distortional modes .      ignoring waves arising from surface distortion ,",
    "the perturbation equations ( [ eq : per_a])([eq : per_d ] ) give rise to two principal types of waves : inertial waves and acoustic waves , both modified by self - gravity .",
    "the former is characterized by epicycle motions , while the latter is based on gas compressibility .",
    "@xcite argued that inertial modes , rather than acoustic modes , are strongly influenced by self - gravity to become unstable . in appendix",
    "[ app : wkb ] , we classify two types of waves using the local dispersion relations and compare them with the numerical results .",
    "we directly demonstrate that while the inertial modes are not much affected by self - gravity and thus remain stable , it is the fundamental acoustic modes that can become unstable in the presence of self - gravity .",
    "this makes sense since both acoustic waves and self - gravity rely on density perturbations , while inertial waves are incompressible in nature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    before exploring numerical dispersion relations , some physical insight on the fundamental acoustic waves in disks",
    "can be gleaned by integrating equation and the horizontal component of equation multiplied by @xmath101 over @xmath31 . with the help of equation",
    ", we obtain @xmath102 where the hat indicates the density - weighted vertical averages ( i.e. , @xmath103 ) .",
    "because @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 are interrelated with each other and generally depend on @xmath82 and @xmath3 , one needs to solve equations  numerically to obtain full dispersion relations .",
    "nevertheless , equation implies that @xmath107 consists of three terms , each responsible for the effect of pressure ( including thermal pressure and surface distortion ) , self - gravity , and the coriolis force , as in equation .",
    "this opens a possibility that by finding solutions of @xmath104 and @xmath105 independent of @xmath3 in some suitable limits , one can obtain an approximate dispersion relation that matches the numerical results closely .",
    "we will focus on this in the remainder of this paper .",
    "as mentioned before , the sound speed of polytropic disks varies with the vertical height , so that it is interesting to find an effective sound speed that best represents modal behavior of waves propagating throughout the disk . also of interest is the effect of surface distortion on sound waves in the case of the free boundaries . to address these issues , we in this section limit ourselves to the fundamental acoustic modes in non - self - gravitating disks . for simplicity , we ignore the effect of disk rotation , which merely adds @xmath108 to @xmath107 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : omegasq_int ] ] ) .      in non - self - gravitating ,",
    "non - rotating disks , equation is reduced to @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the effective sound speed .",
    "when the boundaries are rigid or @xmath70 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 equation shows that excited waves are pure acoustic modes ( @xmath40 modes ) whose restoring force is the thermal pressure . obviously , @xmath113 in an isothermal disk . note that we did not make any approximation in deriving equations and except for ignoring the effects of self - gravity and rotation .    now consider the fundamental mode in the long - wavelength limit .",
    "appendix [ app : non - self ] shows that the fundamental acoustic waves have a simple solution @xmath114 in the limit of @xmath115 .",
    "equation is then simplified to @xmath116 indicating that the effective sound speed corresponds to the density - weighted , harmonic mean of the local sound speeds . for polytropic disks ,",
    "the ratio of the effective sound speed to the midplane sound speed is given analytically by @xmath117 where @xmath118 denotes the gaussian hypergeometric function .",
    "disks with @xmath119 have @xmath120 since the temperature decreases monotonically with height .",
    "when there is no external confining medium ( @xmath70 ) , @xmath121 varies smoothly from @xmath122 to @xmath123 for @xmath124 .",
    "larger external pressure makes @xmath121 closer to unity .    to check the applicability of equation for waves with finite wavelengths , we obtain numerical dispersion relations of pure acoustic waves in non - self - gravitating , non - rotating disks for @xmath70 and @xmath125 and @xmath126 , by following the procedures given in appendix [ app : num ] . figure [ fig : acoustic ] plots the resulting numerical dispersion relations using solid lines , which can be compared with the approximate dispersion relation together with equation shown as dotted lines . when @xmath127 , the dispersion relation is simply @xmath128 .",
    "when @xmath129 , the numerical dispersion relations progressively deviates from the analytic results with increasing @xmath130 . when @xmath131 , however , the two agree within @xmath132 for @xmath133",
    "the agreement becomes better for disks with smaller @xmath134 . since gi occurs for waves with @xmath131 when self - gravity",
    "is included , this suggests that @xmath0 given in equation is a good representative of the averaged sound speed .      in the case of the free bcs , @xmath135 .",
    "then , the effective sound speed in equation becomes @xmath136 where equation is used .",
    "equation indicates that waves in a pressure - confined disk with free boundaries make use of two restoring forces : thermal pressure and vertical gravity .",
    "the former drives acoustic waves , while the latter is responsible for surface - gravity waves .",
    "we term these mixed waves acoustic - surface - gravity waves .",
    "the fact that the effective sound speed has two terms , each arising from sound waves and surface - gravity waves , is completely analogous to longitudinal waves propagating in a distensible tube where the effective compressibility of a gas is the sum of the true gas compressibility and the distensibility of the tube ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    since @xmath137 and @xmath138",
    ", it is apparent that the acoustic term in equation dominates for @xmath134 close to unity . on the other hand ,",
    "the surface - gravity term becomes important in disks with @xmath139 .",
    "appendix [ app : non - self ] shows that in highly confined disks , even fundamental modes have a particular solution @xmath140 .",
    "equation is then reduced to @xmath141 with @xmath100 given by equation ( [ eq : w ] ) .",
    "the sonic contribution @xmath142 is valid for @xmath143 , as in the rigid bc case .",
    "the contribution from surface - gravity waves accounts for the reduced density at the surfaces . in the limit of @xmath144 , equations and recover the usual dispersion relation of surface - gravity waves @xmath145 in an incompressible medium ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
