    "understanding the nature of scalar mesons in terms of quark and gluon constituents is a long standing puzzle in qcd @xcite .",
    "one might expect that the decay rate of these mesons into two photons could provide an important information about their intrinsic composite structure .",
    "the problem here is that some states are very broad ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 mesons ) , others are close to an inelastic threshold ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , which makes their interpretation more difficult . besides the interpretation within a @xmath14 model @xcite or unitarized quark model @xcite , also the possibility of tetraquark states @xcite ( and some other related scenarios : meson - meson molecules @xcite , meson exchange @xcite )",
    "is considered .",
    "in addition , a gluonic meson is expected in the scalar sector , according to lattice qcd @xcite , qcd spectral sum rules ( qssr ) @xcite  la svz @xcite , and some low - energy theorems ( let ) @xcite .",
    "such a state could mix with the other @xmath15 mesons @xcite . among the light particles",
    ", the @xmath16 meson could be such a gluonic resonance .",
    "it can manifest itself in some effective linear sigma models @xcite or contribute to the low - energy constants at @xmath17 of the qcd effective chiral lagrangian @xcite .",
    "recent analyses of the @xmath18 processes have extracted the width of @xmath19 in the range : @xmath20 kev @xcite , @xmath21 or @xmath22 kev @xcite to @xmath23 kev @xcite , while the one from nucleon electromagnetic polarizabilities has given @xmath24 @xcite . some of these results have been interpreted in @xcite as disfavouring a gluonic nature which is expected to have a small coupling to @xmath3 @xcite . in the following",
    ", we shall reconsider the analysis of the @xmath18 process in the low energy region below 700 mev , where we conclude that it is dominated by the coupling of the photons to charged pions and their rescattering , which therefore can hide any direct coupling of the photons to the scalar mesons .",
    "some first results from this study have been presented in @xcite .",
    "the existence of glueballs / gluonia is a characteristic prediction of qcd and some scenarios have been developed already back in 1975 @xcite . today",
    ", there is agreement that such states exist in qcd and the lightest state has quantum numbers @xmath26 .",
    "_ lattice qcd _ - calculations in the simplified world without quark pair creation ( quenched approximation ) find the lightest state at a mass around 1600 mev @xcite . these findings lead to the construction of models where the lightest glueball / gluonium mixes with other mesons in the nearby mass range at around ( 1300 - 1800 ) mev ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent results beyond this quenched approximation @xcite suggest that the lightest state with a large gluonic component is expected in the region around 1 gev , and therefore , a scheme based on the mixing of meson states with all masses higher than 1300 mev could be insufficient to represent the gluonic degrees of freedom in the meson spectrum . further studies concerning the dependence on lattice spacings and the quark mass appear important .    _ qssr and let _ - these approaches have given quantitative estimates of the mass of glueballs / gluonia @xcite and of some essential features of its branching ratios @xcite . as we shall see in section  [ qssr2 ] , these approaches require the existence of a gluonium @xmath9 below 1 gev having a large @xmath2 but small @xmath3 widths , in addition to its corresponding radial excitation @xmath27 and a narrow gluonium g(1.5 - 1.6 ) coupled weakly to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "_ phenomenological studies _ - the identification of the scalar glueball from experiment requires a full understanding of the scalar meson spectrum .",
    "after grouping states into flavour multiplets the left over states are candidates for glueballs .",
    "several schemes exist , motivated by the quenched lattice result , where the extra gluonic state is assumed to mix into the three isoscalars @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite . in an alternative approach @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) the lightest @xmath14 multiplet is formed from @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and the glueball is identified as the broad object at smaller mass represented by @xmath32 ; it dominates @xmath2 scattering near 1 gev but extends from threshold up to @xmath33 mev .",
    "the appearance of this broad object in most gluon rich processes was considered in support of this hypothesis . in this analysis of the spectrum ,",
    "results from elastic and inelastic @xmath2 scattering as well as from @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 decays have been considered @xcite .",
    "given a set of coupled multi - channel strong processes , related electromagnetic or weak processes are largely predetermined .",
    "first , there are the multi - channel extended unitarity relations for the amplitudes with mixed strong and weak couplings ( corresponding to the watson theorem for the single channel ) ; secondly , there are dispersion relations which these amplitudes have to fulfill ( though not proved for composite particles ) .",
    "the general consequences of these constraints have been investigated by omnes and muskhelishvili @xcite for the single- and multi - channel cases .",
    "the amplitudes for the weakly coupled processes are largely determined by strong amplitudes , but there are polynomial ambiguities which result from subtraction terms of the dispersion relations depending on the asymptotic high energy behaviour .",
    "this general formalism has been applied by mennessier @xcite ( see also @xcite ) to the calculation of the electromagnetic processes @xmath37 , given the strong processes @xmath38 .",
    "the strong processes are represented by a k matrix model representing the amplitudes by a set of resonance poles . in that case , the dispersion relations in the multi - channel case can be solved explicitly , which is not possible otherwise . this model can be reproduced by a set of feynman diagrams , including resonance ( bare ) couplings to @xmath2 and @xmath39 and 4-point @xmath2 and @xmath39 interaction vertices .",
    "a subclass of bubble pion loop diagrams including resonance poles in the s - channel are resummed ( unitarized born ) .",
    "the model also includes contributions from the exchange of vector mesons in the t - channel which become important at the higher energies above 700 mev .",
    "the @xmath3 scattering amplitudes also fulfill the constraints at @xmath40 required by the born approximation .",
    "the radiative width of the resonances can not be predicted due to the polynomial ambiguity , which can be taken into account by introducing as free parameters the `` direct couplings '' of the resonances to @xmath3 in an effective interaction vertex . in the present analysis",
    "we have extended the model by the introduction of a _ shape function _ which takes explicitly into account left - handed cut singularities for the strong interaction amplitude .",
    "this allows a more flexible parametrisation of the @xmath41 data at low energies and improves the high energy behaviour .",
    "next we discuss the features of the model at low and at high energies .",
    "a striking feature of the low energy @xmath18 scattering is the dominance of the charged over the neutral @xmath2 cross section by an order of magnitude which can be explained by the contribution of the one - pion - exchange born term in @xmath42 . in the process @xmath43",
    ", the photons can not couple `` directly '' to @xmath44 but through intermediate charged pions and subsequent rescattering with charge exchange .",
    "this feature is realized in the analytic model @xcite .",
    "a similar approach has been applied in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite which described data on @xmath45 up to 900 mev by rescattering .",
    "a modern example for the importance of rescattering is chiral perturbation theory . to one - loop accuracy",
    ", the calculation based on one pion exchange and @xmath2 rescattering relates the @xmath46 to the @xmath47 cross - section using @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the 2-loop corrections obtained in @xcite includes contributions from other exchanges ( spin 1 ) .",
    "it amounts to about 30% of the lowest order results and provides a reasonable description of the data up to @xmath50 mev .",
    "whereas at low energy the photon interacts by its coupling to the charged pions , the situation becomes different at high energies where the photon can resolve the constituents of the hadrons .",
    "an example is the production of @xmath51 in @xmath18 .",
    "the analytic model @xcite predicts a decreasing cross section for this process with pion exchange reaching @xmath52 of the observed cross section at the peak of the @xmath53 .",
    "after inclusion of vector exchange , this contribution doubles .",
    "because of form factor effects involved in the photon coupling to hadrons , these predictions from point like hadrons are to be taken rather as upper limits . this requires the need of `` direct coupling '' of @xmath54 .",
    "indeed , it is well known that the radiative decays of the tensor mesons @xmath55 are well described by a model with direct coupling to the @xmath14 constituents according to the @xmath56 structure of the nonet with nearly ideal mixing ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "another example of a direct process is the production of @xmath57 mesons in the process @xmath58 by direct vmd coupling , which is found much larger than the rescattering contribution from the `` drell - sding '' background process @xcite .",
    "we therefore interpret the direct terms in the @xmath3 processes as representing the amplitudes with coupling of the photon to the partonic constituents of the resonances ( such as @xmath14 , @xmath59 , @xmath60,@xmath61 ) .",
    "in the application of the analytic model @xcite , we first obtain a suitable parametrisation of the @xmath2 scattering data , and then determine the direct coupling by comparing the model with the @xmath3 results . in the present letter ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the low mass region below 700 mev where we neglect vector and axial - vector exchanges  , inelastic channels and d - waves , furthermore , we assume a pointlike pion - photon coupling .",
    "in the k - matrix fits to the @xmath2 elastic scattering data for the range of energy [ ( 0.5 - 1.8 ) gev ] , a pole is found in the isoscalar s - wave amplitude @xmath62 with a large imaginary part which corresponds to a state @xcite : m1  gev , [ sigmamass ] though this value may depend on the treatment of the other resonances @xcite .",

    "then , one predicts the couplings : g__bg__bg_g ( 0.4~0.7 )  gev^-1  , and the corresponding widths - dependence , the widths of the @xmath175 and @xmath168 can be much larger : @xmath186 kev .",
    "these widths induce a tiny effect of @xmath187 to the muon @xmath188 @xcite and can not be excluded . ] : _ _ bm^3__b(0.2~0.6 )  kev  . for a self - consistency check of the previous results",
    ", one can introduce their values into the sum rule : _",
    "g_sf_s = r3  , where @xmath189 , derived @xcite from @xmath190 , by matching the @xmath191 dependence of its two sides .",
    "one can notice that the qssr and let predictions for the mass , hadronic and electromagnetic widths of a low mass gluonium @xmath9 are in remarkable agreement with previous results from @xmath2 and @xmath3 scatterings for an on - shell or / and breit - wigner resonance .",
    "however , the fitted value of direct width in eq .",
    "[ eq : osgamwidth ] to @xmath3 needs to be improved for a sharper comparison .",
    "this  overall agreement \" favours a large gluon component in the @xmath1 wave function .",
    "its large width into @xmath2 indicates a strong violation of the ozi rule in this channel and signals large non - perturbative effects in its treatment .",
    "this large hadronic width also disfavours its @xmath15 interpretation .",
    "in fact qssr predicts for a @xmath193 , with mass of 1 gev , a @xmath124 width of about @xmath194 mev @xcite , and a @xmath195 width of about @xmath196 .",
    "the later can be deduced by using the quark charge squared relation ( 25/9 ) with @xmath197 kev , obtained from the quark triangle loop including the @xmath198 condensate contribution @xcite . in the same way",
    ", qssr also predicts , for a four - quark state , having the same mass of 1 gev @xcite , a @xmath3 width of about 0.4 ev @xcite . both @xmath15 and 4-quark scenarios",
    "are disfavoured by the value of the direct coupling fitted from @xmath3 scattering .",
    "we have reanalyzed the @xmath2 and @xmath3 scattering data in the mass region below 700 mev .",
    "we applied an analytic @xmath199-matrix model which is based on an effective theory with couplings between resonances , hadrons and photons .",
    "the model around the threshold region resembles in its structure with chiral perturbation theory , while the inclusion of resonances and a resummation of a class of meson loop corrections permit its applications towards higher energies .",
    "then , the two - photon decay of a resonance can proceed either through intermediate decay into hadrons and subsequent annihilation or through the direct transition .",
    "the low energy processes considered here are dominated in our fits by the @xmath16 resonance .",
    "its total radiative width of about 4 kev is dominated by the rescattering component which is uniquely predicted for known elastic @xmath2 scattering .",
    "the direct coupling width is found an order of magnitude smaller ( @xmath200 kev ) .",
    "it can be interpreted as representing its intrinsic quark ( @xmath154 ) or / and gluon ( @xmath155 ) constituent contribution to the @xmath3 width . +",
    "a confrontation of the overall fitted resonance parameters with the qssr predictions reviewed in section [ qssr2 ] , for an unmixed bare gluonium @xmath9 having a mass about 1gev , indicate that the @xmath1 can contain a large gluon component in its wave function .",
    "a light glueball / gluonium near 1 gev is also suggested from lattice qcd calculations including dynamical fermions and from the phenomenological analysis of the scalar meson spectrum .",
    "+ it will be interesting to extend this analysis towards higher energies where new channels ( @xmath39 ) will be opened and some other resonances will show up .",
    "this allows for additional constraints on our approach and possible tests of the gluon / quark structure of @xmath1 .",

    "one of us ( w.o . ) would like to thank stephan narison for the invitation and for the kind hospitality at the montpellier university within the grant provided by region of languedoc - roussillon septimanie where this work had begun .",
