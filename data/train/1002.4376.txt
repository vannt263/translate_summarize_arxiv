    "in order to learn more about the inner essence of nature , particle physicists smash together small particles , such as protons , at large energies , and use huge detectors to detect whatever comes out .",
    "the higher the energy , the smaller distances can be examined , which also means that nature at smaller scales can be studied and reveal its secrets .",
    "the story is in fact much more complicated .",
    "the protons that clash together are composite particles made up by quarks and gluons that can not be isolated and studied in their own , but are always confined inside the proton .",
    "the collision between two protons is therefore better described as a collision of two approaching bunches of particles , and for the outcome to tell us about nature we need to know what takes part in the collision .",
    "therefore , so called parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) describe how the momentum of the proton is shared between partons , i.e. quarks and gluons .",
    "the pdfs make up one of the ingredients of computer simulations , which combine theories and models in order to predict the outcome , and make it possible to test theory against experiment .    in this thesis",
    "we have included the very latest parton distribution functions in the monte carlo event generator pythia8 @xcite .",
    "we compare them and examine how the difference in pdfs affect results of simulations .",
    "we also compare the results to real data collected by experiments at tevatron @xcite and examine how the differences change when increasing the energy up to the level of a fully operational lhc ( 14  tev ) @xcite .",
    "the structure of the thesis is as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce some of the concepts of the theory of strong interactions , quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) . in section 3",
    "we move on to describe monte carlo generators ( such as pythia8 ) and section 4 tells the story of parton distribution functions .",
    "section 5 describes how the pdfs were included in pythia8 and we compare the different pdfs in section 6 .",
    "subsequently we study results from simulations of minimum bias events and hard qcd events in section 7 and 8 respectively .",
    "finally we conclude with summary and conclusions in section 9 .",
    "the standard model of particle physics is the joint theory of three of the four fundamental forces of nature : electromagnetism , weak and strong force .",
    "the part describing the strong interactions , quantum chromo dynamics , is responsible for holding together protons and neutrons in the nucleus as well as quarks inside the nucleons .",
    "the strong force is mediated by gluons , which interact with particles that carry color charge , and it grows stronger with distance .",
    "colored particles are therefore confined inside colorless hadrons such as the proton and can never be observed and studied as free particles .",
    "most calculations in qcd rely on a perturbative expansion in the coupling of the theory .",
    "perturbative qcd uses the feynman diagrams and rules to calculate matrix elements and thereby obtain cross sections for different processes .",
    "this technique relies on the coupling of the strong force , @xmath0 , to be small enough to make the expansion converge and allow the first terms to be a good approximation . at high energies",
    "the strong force is weak , the quarks experience asymptotic freedom and the approximation of truncating the expansion at low orders is good .",
    "as one moves down to lower energy , increasingly higher orders would be required , but the perturbation expansion in @xmath0 quickly becomes very complicated and at small enough scales it finally breaks down completely .",
    "there are many possible feynman graphs for each process and all of them will contribute to the cross section . at next - to - leading order",
    "the diagrams start to involve loops which introduce integrals over the phase space of the internal lines .",
    "these loop integrals diverge , but at each order the real ( extra particle in the final state ) and virtual ( extra particle internal ) divergences combine , in a far from trivial way , to cancel out all infinities and leave finite results .",
    "this results in very complicated calculations and therefore many processes have only been calculated to leading order .",
    "the matrix element calculation gives rise to divergences in two cases , when two partons are collinear and when the energy of a parton is small , soft divergence .",
    "how accurate the approximation of the low order expansion is depends on the size of the coupling @xmath0 .",
    "the running of the coupling , @xmath1 , is necessary in order to absorb infinities in the theory .",
    "this is called renormalization and the running is determined by the renormalization group equation @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 the two constants depend on the number of flavors , @xmath4 , that have their threshold below the energy scale , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . solving this equation and introducing the mass scale @xmath7 yields @xmath8 the first term",
    "is the first order expression and the dots are terms that decrease in relative importance for large @xmath9 . from this",
    "it can be seen that @xmath0 decreases at large @xmath9 as @xmath10 and therefore become very small , but also that the coupling increases towards infinity as @xmath9 approaches @xmath11 .",
    "the cross section describes how likely it is that an interaction will take place . in the regions where the matrix elements can be calculated these give the cross sections for hard sub - processes , such as @xmath12 . to describe the cross section for the sub - process we introduce the mandelstam variables , @xmath13 where @xmath14-@xmath15 are the four - momenta of the particles .",
    "the differential cross section is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are energies of the two outgoing partons and the @xmath19-function ensures conservation of energy and momentum .",
    "@xmath20 is the sum ( average ) over initial- ( final- ) state spins and colors .",
    "@xmath21 is the matrix element and for the @xmath22 process , assuming massless partons , @xmath23 to leading order .",
    "the sub - process cross section , @xmath24 , is a function of the momenta of the partons , the value of the strong coupling at a relevant energy scale @xmath25 of the process and the factorization scale @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath26 can be seen as the scale which separates long- and short - distance physics @xcite , i.e. partons with transverse momentum less than @xmath26 are considered as part of the proton and are absorbed into the pdf .",
    "the standard choice is to set @xmath27 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "assuming no @xmath28 of the interacting partons , the center - of - mass energy squared for the entire collision , @xmath29 , and for the colliding sub - system , @xmath30 , are related by @xmath31 hence the product @xmath32 determines the energy fraction available in the sub - process , while the ratio gives the rapidity @xmath33 and thereby determines the direction of motion of the colliding sub - system .",
    "in large rapidity events the interacting partons therefore have very different momentum fractions .",
    "the average transverse momentum is often good as an energy scale of the process and an upper limit on the transverse energy , @xmath28 , is set by the energy available in the subprocess @xmath34 with equality only for back to back scattering of two partons perpendicular to the beam axis . in minimum bias events a typical @xmath35  gev , setting a lower limit on the product , @xmath36 at the lhc , for such an event .",
    "the cross section from the matrix element calculations divergence as @xmath37 when @xmath38 .",
    "this must be regularized for low transverse momentum which is accomplished by introducing a parameter , @xmath39 , ( to be discussed more in section [ sec : minbias ] ) such that @xmath40    to obtain the total cross section for the process when two protons collide the probability to find the partons with momentum fraction @xmath41 inside the proton have to be taken into account , see fig .",
    "[ fig : feynman ] .",
    "the total cross section is then obtained by summing over the different possible partons and integrating over the allowed momentum fractions @xmath41 ,     and @xmath42 .",
    "one parton from each respective proton , with momentum fractions @xmath43 and @xmath44 , take part in a hard scattering sub - process producing final - state particles.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    @xmath45    where @xmath46 and @xmath42 are the momenta of the two incoming protons .",
    "@xmath47 is the parton distribution function of parton i , which will be described in more detail in section [ chap : pdf ] .",
    "experiments such as proton collisions at high energy are too complicated to make predictions based solely on calculations from first principles of the standard model and therefore one has to rely on monte carlo generators .",
    "the generators start with a central hard collision and then combine matrix elements , parton showers , multiple parton - parton interactions and hadronization models to predict the outcome.@xcite    as described in the previous chapter , matrix - element calculations do not describe qcd accurately over the entire phase space . in regions where higher order terms are necessary to give good approximations the mc generators use the technique of parton showers , which approximates the higher order terms . at each step in the shower",
    "the emission probability is calculated and an emission is generated , building up an event with many outgoing partons .",
    "this method is a good approximation when the shower can be strongly ordered , i.e. the ordering variable such as virtuality decreases with each emission .",
    "that is the case for the largest part of the cross section but not for the hard interactions , where outgoing partons escape at large angles @xcite .",
    "the parton showers can be subdivided into two types , initial - state radiation ( isr ) and final - state radiation ( fsr ) .",
    "as the names suggest , isr describes how the incoming proton branches into many quarks and gluons before the collision while fsr takes the products of the collision and describes how they branch into more particles .",
    "fsr is evolved in strictly ordered virtuality where at each step the virtuality is smaller than in the previous .",
    "isr is more complicated .",
    "it is ordered in increasing virtuality but since the simulation starts with the hard interaction the isr has to be evolved backwards @xcite .",
    "this backward evolution of isr is one of the most challenging parts of a generator @xcite .",
    "the showers and matrix elements are good approximations in two entirely different regions .",
    "matrix elements are good for hard collisions , producing particles at large transverse momentum while parton showers are good at low energies and for collinear partons . in order to make use of their respective advantages they need to be matched at some energy scale to cover the entire phase space and",
    "in a way that assures there is no double counting @xcite , @xcite .",
    "pythia8 uses showers ordered in @xmath28 which has an advantage over mass ordered showers ( which were used in the previous version pythia6.4 @xcite ) because it automatically takes care of some effects due to coherence between emissions .",
    "these , however , are not the only possible choices and for example herwig @xcite , the other large general monte carlo generator , uses energy weighted angular ordering .",
    "this has advantages related to coherence effects but can not be used over the full phase space and hence leaves some regions to be filled in by high order matrix elements @xcite .",
    "after the fsr the hadronization starts , and the partons produced in the previous stages split up and combine into colorless hadrons than can survive and possibly reach a detector .",
    "it is also at this level that experiments collect their data .",
    "the hadronization has not yet been possible to determine from the theory and therefore models are required .",
    "pythia8 uses the lund string model @xcite where partons tie color connections to each other which break by forming quark ",
    "antiquark pairs , while herwig uses cluster fragmentation @xcite .",
    "there is no reason why , in a proton collision , there should only be one parton from each proton that interacts , and in fact it is not even the case most of the time .",
    "therefore the so called multiple interaction framework simulates the additional interactions . as the collision energy increases , partons at smaller @xmath41",
    "become involved and more particles can be produced in the isr .",
    "multiple interactions are therefore increasing and the models for multiparticle interactions are put to the test as the energy at lhc rises .",
    "pdfs are used in monte carlo generators at several stages .",
    "first in calculating the cross section for the hard collision to take place , which we have seen in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : cross ] .",
    "secondly , isr use the pdfs since it is the partons inside the proton that will shower , so the pdfs are needed to describe what we have to start with and is used in the backwards evolution of the isr .",
    "finally , pdfs also enter through cross section calculations in the multiple interactions framework .",
    "the static properties of the proton are dominated by the valence quarks , i.e. two up quarks and one down quark . the dynamic picture of the proton is less simple .",
    "quarks interact by exchanging gluons , which can split up into quark ",
    "antiquark pairs and send out additional gluons .",
    "the proton thus consists of three valence quarks , gluons and sea quarks which all go under the common name of partons .",
    "parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) describe how the momentum of the proton is distributed among partons and at leading order they can be interpreted as the probability to find a parton inside the proton with a certain momentum fraction . at higher order this simple picture fails since , for example , the nlo pdfs can be negative .",
    "there are six quarks with antiquarks and adding the gluon , the proton has , potentially , 13 pdfs . however , the heavy top quark / antiquark is not included taking the number down to eleven . when a gluon splits it is always into a quark ",
    "antiquark pair , and hence the distributions of quarks and antiquarks should be the same ( once the valence quarks are excluded ) .",
    "therefore strange , charm and bottom quarks used to be considered to have exactly the same distribution as their respective antiquark , setting the total number of distributions to 8 .",
    "however this is not necessarily true and this symmetry can be broken , which is also the case ( at least ) for the strange quark / antiquark .",
    "the proton can be seen as accompanied by a kaon cloud , since the proton can split into a @xmath48 and a @xmath49 , where the @xmath29 quark sits in the first and the @xmath50 in the second .",
    "there is no reason to believe that the @xmath29 quark in the @xmath7 should have the same momentum as the @xmath50 in the @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "therefore some of the newer pdfs have a small difference between the two distributions .",
    "the pdfs obey a number of relations such as the the momentum sum rule @xmath52 where the sum is over all partons in the pdf , which states that the total momentum of all the partons must equal the momentum of the proton .",
    "the pdfs are functions of the fraction of the proton s momentum @xmath41 carried by the parton and of @xmath9 , which can be interpreted as a measure of resolving power .",
    "once the parton distributions are known for one specific @xmath9 , they can be evolved to higher @xmath9 by use of the dglap equation @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the parton distribution function for parton @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the splitting function .",
    "the outcome of experiments depend on how the momentum is distributed but there is no way to directly calculate what the distribution should be .",
    "therefore several groups work on parameterizing and fitting pdfs to available data @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the large @xmath41 behavior of the pdfs are constrained by fixed target experiments . at smaller @xmath41",
    "the constraints come from deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) at electron - proton colliders such as hera .",
    "the dis data have high statistics and therefore dominate the pdf fits .",
    "this gives good knowledge of the quark distributions but the gluon distribution is harder to obtain , since gluons do not directly interact with electrons . in hadron",
    "colliders the picture is much more messy , since there is now two composite particles and the gluon distribution is therefore the least constrained part of the pdfs . for more details on the data sets of pdf fits",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there are pdfs of several different orders , lo , nlo and some nnlo .",
    "the general - purpose generators are all leading order and therefore one would like to combine them with leading - order pdfs .",
    "however , we know for example that higher orders generally give positive contributions to cross sections and in recent years some modified lo pdfs have been released , specifically tailored for leading - order monte carlo generators .",
    "these try to simulate some of the effects of nlo calculations by compensating for known shortcomings of the leading - order . among other things",
    "these pdfs allow for a non - conservation of momentum by relaxing the momentum sum rule , i.e. the partons inside the proton are allowed to have a total momentum larger than the momentum of the proton .",
    "this permits the pdfs to grow large in some regions without decreasing in others and thereby simulate the effects of some of the next - to - leading - order corrections , in particular allowing a large value of the gluon distribution at small @xmath41 without compromising the quark distributions at large @xmath41 .",
    "the mc - adapted pdfs released so far are lo * and lo * * @xcite from the mrst group and mc1 , mc2 and mcs @xcite from the cteq group .",
    "all of them except mcs have relaxed the momentum sum rule .",
    "mc1 use a leading - order running of @xmath0 while lo * , lo * * and mc2 use next to leading - order running .",
    "lo * * also has a change in argument , to @xmath57 rather than @xmath9 , for @xmath0 for high - x evolution .",
    "mcs has more freedom in the parameterization and allows for change with scale , to simulate nlo cross section calculations ( a feature we do not make use of in pythia8 ) .",
    "mc1/2/s are all fitted to a combination of real data and nlo pseudo data in an attempt to obtain the ideal pdf for leading - order mc generators .",
    "pythia8 @xcite has so far been distributed with the option to choose between two pdfs , grv94l @xcite and cteq5l @xcite , which are both fairly old .",
    "many new and improved pdfs have been released and made available to pythia8 simulations only through lhapdf @xcite .",
    "the lhapdf package has grown quite large and in that process also a bit slow , also the code is written in fortran while the community is changing to c++ .",
    "it is desirable to include some pdfs directly into pythia8 because it can speed up simulations , make pythia8 more complete and make it easier to switch between different frequently used pdfs .",
    "furthermore some of the latest pdfs have not yet been included in lhapdf .",
    "therefore we incorporate ten new pdfs from the mrst @xcite-@xcite , mstw 2008 @xcite , cteq6 @xcite and cteq mc @xcite distributions into pythia8 .",
    "two of them are nlo which are not intended for mc use , but included for comparison .",
    "the main danger with them is for low-@xmath28 processes .",
    "inclusion of the pdfs was done in cooperation with the mstw and cteq collaborations , @xcite-@xcite , and the pdfs are listed in tab .",
    "[ pdftab ] . +    .pdfs that are now included in pythia8 .",

    "all simulations are done at the cm - energy of 1960  gev , if not explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "so as not to cram the pictures , not all sets are shown all the time .",
    "we have tried to choose a selection of pdfs to show in each plot what represents both the extremes and the middle way .",
    "the rapidity distributions of the outgoing particles at the parton level when only the @xmath58 sub - process is considered are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : rapid - strip ] .",
    "mstw lo has a broader distribution than the rest of the pdfs with more particles at larger rapidities as an effect of the large gluon distribution at the small @xmath41 .",
    "we can also see that lo * * closely resembles mc2 , as does lo * and mc1 while the two nlo distributions are lower in the central rapidity region .",
    "the remaining leading - order distributions all show similarities to the mc - adapted ones .    turning on the rest of the pythia8 machinery and looking at the distribution of charged particles after hadronization , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rapid ] , the distribution changes its shape .",
    "there are now more particles at larger rapidities as a result of fragmenting color field strings stretched out to the beam remnants and most of the differences between the pdfs get blurred .",
    "some differences still remain and mstw lo is still smaller for central rapidities , and as a remnant of the wider distribution lack the inward dents that all other pdfs have at rapidities around @xmath59 .",
    "the peaks of lo * * and mc2 are a bit sharper than for lo * and mc1 but the trace of the lower value of the cteq66 at central rapidity is gone .",
    "minimum bias events are dominated by @xmath60 interactions but if we go back to the partons in fig .",
    "[ fig : rapid - strip ] and select only the outgoing quarks , i.e. mainly from @xmath61 , large underlying differences are revealed , see fig .",
    "[ fig : rapid - quarks ] .",
    "the ct09 and cteq66 distributions show smooth shapes leading up to a peak at zero rapidity , while lo*/ * * have a very flat distribution at central rapidities .",
    "the outlier is once again the mstw lo distribution which shows peaks at large rapidities .",
    "this is once again caused by the large gluon distribution at small @xmath41 and we believe a reason , that it is so much more prominent for the quarks , is that mstw lo has a relatively small gluon distribution at large @xmath41 which in asymmetric @xmath62 interactions somewhat compensates , while the up - quark distribution is similar to the other pdfs . the normal lo distributions from cteq show similar distributions as the mc - adapted ones from mstw . actually cteq5l show similar peaks as mstw lo , and looking at the gluon distribution at low energies we can see that before it freezes as @xmath63 it is larger than in all other pdfs .",
    "there is also a clear difference in the amount of quarks produced where cteq66 has a much larger amount and thereby produces much more quark initiated jets than the rest of the pdfs .",
    "the multiplicity distributions are similar for most pdfs .",
    "the two nlo distributions stand out as two extremes in different directions where mstw nlo has the highest peak and the shortest tail as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : multdist ] . all mc - adapted pdfs except mcs",
    "have a peak slightly shifted to larger multiplicities but are different in height where the two from mrst have a larger peak value .",

    "now with @xmath0 set differently for the different pdfs , i.e. the value at @xmath64 and the order of the running is determined by the pdfs , does not significantly change anything , once the multiplicity has been retuned . as an illustration of this point , the results with the two different @xmath0 for the lo *",

    "+     +     +     +    the main feature is the surprising decrease in the cross section ratio from low to high @xmath28 with the mc - adapted pdfs , which we do not see with neither lo nor nlo pdfs . in order to examine the origin of this difference we look at the cross section at the parton level , after the hard collision only . since we can not compare to data we choose to compare to cteq5l , which gives a more constant @xmath28 evolution of the cross section .",
    "the ratios , @xmath77 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : rjet ] show that the relative decrease with lo * and lo * * is clearly visible also at parton level .",
    "this is also the case for the three mc1/2/s pdfs in fig  [ fig : rjet ] , but to less extent , while the mstw lo results have an almost completely flat ratio . to investigate this",
    "further we integrate an approximation of the cross section @xmath78 for only the @xmath60 interactions and a clear pattern very similar to the one at parton level become visible , see fig .",
    "[ fig : expdfcross - quark ] . fig .",
    "[ fig : expdfcross - all ] shows that this is no longer the case if we include the other possible interactions , i.e. @xmath61 and @xmath79 but at the low @xmath28 end the gluon interactions dominate .",
    "turning our attention to the rapidity distribution the results show less variety , see fig.[fig : jetcrap ] .",
    "however , excluding mcs , all the mc - adapted pdfs give a narrower distribution .",
    "one should not be fooled by the steep slope which hides the differences .",
    "mstw lo and nlo are smaller at central rapidities and actually have a lower multiplicity while the rest of the cteq distributions follow cteq5l .",
    "even though the pdfs have equal charged particle multiplicity for minbias events this no longer holds true for the hard qcd events .",
    "all mc - adapted pdfs except mcs have multiplicity distributions shifted towards lower multiplicity , which is also the case for mstw nlo and to some extent for mstw lo , see fig  [ fig : jetcmult ] .",
    "including the very latest parton distribution functions into pythia8 both caused some troubles and gave some surprises , especially while venturing outside the grid of the pdfs . at small @xmath41 , where the gluon distribution dominates , there are large differences between the pdfs , especially at low @xmath9 .",
    "the mrst / mstw distributions are much larger than the ones from cteq , and mstw lo goes sky high compared to the rest of the pdfs . at larger @xmath9 the differences are smaller between the two collaborations , except for the distributions which freeze their values at the end of the grid , and for mstw lo which is still much larger than the rest .",
    "the quarks , and in particular the up distributions , at large @xmath41 show smaller differences , but mstw lo is once again larger at small @xmath41 .",
    "some of the new mc - adapted pdfs carry a fraction of the protons momentum larger than unity , in an attempt to compensate for known shortcomings of leading - order calculations . therefore these give a larger activity in the collisions and in order to be able to compare results from the different pdfs in simulations , we first tuned them to obtain equal charged particle multiplicity .",
    "the different behavior for mstw lo was also reflected in rapidity distributions both at the level of the @xmath58 sub - process and after hadronization . in general the differences in the pdfs are blurred down to parton level and then blurred even more at hadron level , but some large differences still remain . by comparison to minimum bias data from cdf we saw that the mc adapted",
    "pdfs gave similar results and were in general closer to data than the lo and nlo pdfs , with the exception of cteq6l .",
    "differences between the results with different pdfs were enhanced when the energy was increased up to the lhc level .",
    "we also discovered that the multiplicity evolved differently with mstw lo and with the two next to leading - order pdfs than with the rest .    in the simulations of hard qcd events we saw that the rapidity distributions with the mc - adapted pdfs were narrower , and that their multiplicity distributions were shifted to lower multiplicity .",
    "the evolution of the differential jet cross section with @xmath28 was found to be strongly dependent on the choice of pdf , both when it came to its size and shape . in the simulations of hard events we saw that the rapidity distribution was narrower for the mc - adapted pdfs and that their multiplicity distributions shifted to lower multiplicity .",
    "the evolution of the cross section with @xmath28 was strongly dependent on the pdf . comparing the @xmath28 spectrum ratio ( simulation over data )",
    "the mc - adapted pdfs showed a rather surprising change in ratio with @xmath28 which we examined further .",
    "the same behavior could be seen at the level of the @xmath58 sub - process as well and this was traced to the @xmath60 interactions , that dominate in this region .",
    "the changes in behavior for the inclusive jet cross section with different pdfs can also be caused by the change of dominating process in the @xmath28 , from @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "simulations of prompt photon production also showed such decrease in the cross section for @xmath62 but not for @xmath80 nor @xmath81 interactions .",
    "there is a need for better understanding of parton distribution functions at small @xmath41 where the pdfs are now very different from each other . in minbias events",
    "@xmath41 values of the order of @xmath82 are the most common .",
    "mc simulations need the pdfs to range down to @xmath83 which so far only the three brand new ct09 pdfs do , and we would therefore like to encourage mstw to extend their grid for the mc - adapted pdfs in their next release . at several occasions we were reminded that it can be risky to use nlo pdfs in lo mc generators .",
    "our implementation of lo * and lo * * with the new grid causes these two distributions to have a smaller gluon distribution at small @xmath41 , but would otherwise give results more similar mstw lo .",
    "in addition we found that there is a need for improved numerical stability at large @xmath41 in order to keep the leading - order pdfs from going negative .",
    "this could possibly be solved by using less intricate interpolation routines in this area .",
    "possibly one could choose an @xmath84 , different for sea - quarks , gluons and valence quarks , above which one uses the form @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are functions of the virtuality , which would ensure positivity .",
    "the large differences in the pdfs get blurred when looking at simulation results , but nonetheless do sometimes cause large variations .",
    "changing from the default @xmath0 behavior in pythia8 to @xmath0 value and running determined by the pdfs did not change the results , once the multiplicity had been retuned .",
    "interesting to note is that the ct09mcs seems to have some of the features of the other mc - adapted pdfs but in some contexts gives results more similar to ordinary leading - order pdfs .",
    "the difference in quark rapidity between mc1/2/s and the rest could be due to their fitting to the nlo pseudo data .",
    "the only two other distributions with similar shape are the two nlo pdfs .",
    "we could see that a @xmath69-factor for the leading - order pdfs could improve the fit to the inclusive jet data , but for the mc - adapted pdfs the change of the ratio makes it more complicated .",
    "finally , the differences in the pdfs have a larger impact when the cm - energy of the collisions increases , and this can cause large uncertainties in simulations at lhc energies .    at this point no final answer as to which pdf gives the best results . in order to answer this question",
    "one has to look at a much broader spectrum of observables and also make complete tunes for the different pdfs .    in the last years",
    "there has been a renewed interest in lo tunes with focus on the applicability in mc generators .",
    "the mc - adapted pdfs resulted in some very interesting differences compared to leading - order pdf but there is still room for further improvements . with these new pdfs",
    "we have gained a broader spectrum of tools in pythia8 and in examining the origin of differences and similarities between simulations and experiments .",
    "first and foremost i want to thank my supervisor torbjrn sjstrand for his help and ability to explain difficult things in an understandable way .",
    "i also owe many thanks to leif lnnblad , hendrik hoeth and all the other people at the department of theoretical physics , as well as to marianne ds , sanne kasemets and julia kryszewska .",
    "i would also like to mention johan bijnens , joakim cederkll , bo sderberg and hans - uno bengtsson who all played an important role in my previous education ."
