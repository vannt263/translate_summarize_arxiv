    "the mystery of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) classification has puzzled astronomers since 1990s . @xcite",
    "firstly discovered the bimodal distribution of @xmath1 and proposed the duration classification criterion , that is long grbs with @xmath2 and short grbs with @xmath3 , this classification method has been widely accepted by many authors so far .",
    "the two kinds of grbs are thought to have different physical origins .",
    "short grbs are believed to be the product of merging of binary systems , like two neutron stars ( ns - ns ) or a system of neutron star and black hole ( ns - bh ) @xcite .",
    "lgrbs have close relationship with the collapse of massive stars that has been mostly confirmed by observations @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite analysed the @xmath4 distribution of batse 3b catalogue including 797 grbs and found a possible existence of one more class .",
    "the phenomenal evidence was also found in the datasets of _ bepposax _",
    "swift_/bat @xcite , _",
    "fermi_/gbm @xcite etc .",
    "besides the observed duration distribution , several authors also did similar studies of the distribution in the rest frame .",
    "@xcite analysed the duration distribution of 95 redshift - known _ swift _ grbs and found that the intrinsic duration is still bimodal .",
    "@xcite found that 3 groups were statistically better that 2 groups after studying the intrinsic duration distribution of a larger datasets redshift - known _ swift _ grbs , which contains 248 grbs .",
    "@xcite analysed the distribution of 947 _ swift _ grbs observed duration and 347 redshift - known grbs duration in both observer and rest frames .",
    "it is found that 3 groups are statistically better than 2 groups in the observer frame ( see also @xcite ) . in the rest frame , 2 groups are good enough for the 347 redshift - known grbs .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the duration distribution of 888 _ swift _ grbs observed before october 2015 .",
    "they found that three log - normal function is better to fit the duration distribution than two log - normal function , with a 99.9999% significance level .",
    "their results showed that the relative frequencies were 8% , 35% and 57% for short , intermediate and long bursts , respectively ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they further claimed that no significant differences of the redshift distribution were found between the intermediate grbs and the long ones .",
    "however , the existence of this third class is still controversial so far .    considering this",
    ", durations - based classification of grbs might not be an only standard .",
    "@xcite proposed that more observational properties , namely _ redshift , fluence , flux , @xmath5 _ of the @xmath6 spectrum and etc .",
    ", should be taken into account together .",
    "meanwhile , sgrbs usually have harder spectra than lgrbs @xcite , the clustering phenomenon in the plane of duration versus harness ratio ( @xmath0 vs @xmath7 ) should also be useful to classify the grbs .",
    "@xcite did clustering analysis of @xmath0 vs @xmath7 diagram for batse and _ swift _ datasets , respectively .",
    "they found the possible existence of the third class .",
    "it is worth noting that the above studies are carried out based on the observations only that may involve the selection effect or bias .",
    "in addition , different methods applied for the same sample may reach controversial judgement of grb classes . to avoid all the above influences , we apply gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) and expectation maximization ( em ) algorithm to the density estimation of @xmath0 vs @xmath7 diagram for the redshift - known _ swift _ grbs in both the observer frame and the rest frame .",

    "the observed spectral hardness @xmath9 in our analysis was defined as the fluence ratio between 50 kev@xmath10100 kev and 25 kev@xmath1050 kev and it can be calculated by the fluence properties listed in the catalog . to calculate the intrinsic spectral hardness @xmath11",
    ", we use the best fitted spectral model provided in the _ swift _ official site . in our datasets , there are 261 grbs following the single power law model ( pl ) and other 35 grbs are better to be described with the cutoff power law model ( cpl ) .",
    "the pl and cpl forms can be written as    f(e)= a*e^- + a*e^-*e^-e/    where @xmath8 are the single power law or the cutoff power law photon index , @xmath12 is the peak energy , and @xmath13 represents the photon flux at a given energy . the hardness ratio can be calculated by @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the cosmological redshift .",
