    "since the discovery more than a decade ago that our universe has entered a new phase of accelerated expansion @xcite the study of non - flat asymptotically space - times geometries has drawn more and more attention from the scientific community .",
    "one of the most studied non - flat geometries is the de sitter one due to it s rich symmetries and the fact that if our universe continues it s accelerated expansion ( which could be driven by the presence in the einstein equations of a nonzero cosmological constant ) then it will pass in the far future through a de sitter phase . moreover , the inflationary phase @xcite can be also described with a good approximation by a de sitter geometry .",
    "it is worth noticing that lagrangian modified gravity , which provides a dynamical mechanism for an effective cosmological constant implemented by the higher curvature terms in the lagrangian , has found an application in cosmology ( see e.g. @xcite ) in order to explain dark energy effects .",
    "moreover , these so - called @xmath1 theories contain schwarzschild - de sitter metric as a vacuum solution @xcite .",
    "they were also tested in the solar - system and galactic scales @xcite .    on the other hand",
    "the study of black holes also continues to be a hot topic in research today . since hawking s @xcite proposal that black holes can radiate energy through emission of particles ,",
    "there have been a lot of research done in this line .",
    "however , it seems that the vast majority of studies concentrated on the asymptotically flat case while the non - flat case has been less studied so far .",
    "one of the quantities characteristic to the hawking radiation are the greybody factors that describe the departure of the spectrum from the one of a pure black body .",
    "thus in the present study we investigate the problem of low energy greybody factors for fermions emitted by a schwarzschild - de sitter ( sds ) black hole . in order to do this",
    "we apply similar methods used by unruh @xcite for the case of schwarzschild black holes ( see also more recent studies @xcite ) .",
    "this consists mainly in obtaining approximative analytical solutions to the field equations in the vicinity of the black hole , respectively the cosmological horizons and then matching these solutions ( technique valid only at low energies ) and determining the absorbtion probabilities or equivalently the greybody factors .",
    "given the complexity of the differential equations in the region between the two horizons we will perform our analysis only for small values of the cosmological constant .",
    "up to our knowledge this is one of the first attempts to study analytically the emission of fermions from sds black holes . besides the numerical study performed in ref .",
    "@xcite we havent found other studies that treat the problem of fermion emission in the 4-dimensional sds geometry .",
    "the existing literature seems to be concentrated on the scalar case for which both numerical and analytical studies where performed @xcite ; or on two - dimensional vaidya - de sitter toy models @xcite ; on thermodynamical radiation via tunneling @xcite or the associated quasinormal frequencies @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper consists in presenting some general notions about the dirac equation in curved space - times and a few basic proprieties of sds black holes in section 2 .",
    "the solutions to the field equations are presented in section 3 where we concentrate our attention especially on finding the dirac modes in an intermediate region between the two horizons present in sds geometry .",
    "section 4 is concentrated on finding the greybody factors for this geometry followed by a brief study of energy spectrum .",
    "we end our investigation with a brief section dedicated to our main conclusions .",
    "trough this paper we use natural units with @xmath2 and a @xmath3 metric signature .",
    "in this section we present a short review of the dirac equation written in the cartesian gauge proposed some time ago in @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of this gauge is that it allows us to separate the spherical degrees of freedom in the same manner done for the central problems in a flat space - time @xcite .",
    "this implies that the dirac field will be a linear combination of particular modes .",

    "the third solution to @xmath50 turns out to be related to the other two by @xmath51 .",

    "we will match these solutions two by two in order to find an analytical expression for the greybody factors that characterize the emission of fermions by schwarzschild - de sitter black holes .",
    "let us start by making the observation that the matching of the solutions works only in the low - energy regime for which we can expand for small values of @xmath4 the near horizon solutions given in ( [ s4 ] ) and ( [ s5 ] ) to obtain @xmath108 @xmath109    in order to match @xmath110 with @xmath111 , respectively @xmath111 with @xmath112 we first need to find out the shape of the function @xmath111 in the vicinity of the two horizons .",
    "the @xmath113 limit of @xmath111 when @xmath114 approaches the two horizons is given by the following formula @xmath115 where the constants @xmath116 and @xmath117 are defined as @xmath118    thus , the @xmath64 limit of ( [ s19 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath119    comparing ( [ g1 ] ) with ( [ g5 ] ) will give us the following matching conditions @xmath120    taking now the @xmath65 limit of ( [ s19 ] ) yields @xmath121 and comparting this time with the solution at the cosmological horizon given in ( [ g2 ] ) will lead us in the end at @xmath122    taking into account the form of the asymptotic solutions ( [ s4])-([s5 ] ) and the conservation of flux we can now compute using relations ( [ g6 ] ) and ( [ g8 ] ) the greybody factors for which we found the following expression @xmath123    the above form of the greybody factors looks very similar with the one obtained in @xcite for the case of scalar particle emission , for which the authors have also found @xmath124 to be constant at low - energies .",
    "we see that this feature remains valid also in the case of low - energy fermion emission by a sds black hole .",
    "moreover for fermions the greybody factor ( or equivalently the absorbtion probability ) has a constant value for each mode at very low - energies , for which the above ( [ g9 ] ) formula is valid .",
    "however , for fermions @xmath125 has a much more complicated dependence on @xmath62 and @xmath63 compared to the scalar case for which@xcite @xmath126    let us mention that both expressions ( 42 ) and ( 43 ) for the absorption probability take the value @xmath127 in the limit @xmath128 ( @xmath129 @xmath130 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that in this limit @xmath131 in such a way that @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , a ratio @xmath133 in ( 43 ) and one gets expected result .",
    "similarly , the second term in ( 42 ) can be expressed as a function of ratios @xmath134 .",

    "we observe from the table that for each mode the value of @xmath125 becomes higher as we increase the value of the cosmological constant @xmath44 .",
    "another conclusion that can be drawn is the fact that the contribution of the lowest mode @xmath142 to the emission spectra will be the dominant one .",

    "@xcite to be equal to @xmath158 .",
    "thus we see that in the presence of a cosmological constant a sds black hole will emit even more low - energy scalar quanta as hawking radiation compared with the radiation emitted by a pure schwarzschild black hole .",
    "let us now address the problem of energy spectrum .",
    "it is known that the energy emission rate for spin @xmath159 particles for a sds black hole has the usual expression@xcite @xmath160 where @xmath161 represents the speed of the fermion and @xmath162 is the bousso - hawking temperature@xcite of the black hole @xmath163 with @xmath164 obtained from the zero point of the first derivative of @xmath41 .    the energy spectrum obtained using ( [ es1 ] ) and ( [ g9 ] ) is displayed in fig.[f2 ] .",
    "this spectra should be trusted for quantitative results only in the low - energy regime . in the intermediate and high - energy regimes the spectra",
    "is expected to suffer modifications due to the fact that in these regimes the greybody factor will eventually develop a dependence on energy .",
    "we observe an enhancement of the spectrum with the increasing value of the cosmological constant . in the case of asymptotically flat schwarzschild black holes the energy emission rate for fermions vanishes in the limit @xmath165 .",
    "we see that this remains valid also for sds black boles .",
    "however , for massless scalar particles it turns out that this limit has a non - vanishing value for sds as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . taking the limit of ( [ es1 ] ) as the energy goes to zero",
    "one can see that as long as the greybody factor has a constant value the energy emission rate will always go to zero regardless of the fermion mass . in the case of massive scalars",
    "it was showed in ref.@xcite that the energy emission rate again goes to zero for a sds black hole .    .",

    "in this paper we calculated for the first time , analytically , the low - energy greybody factors for fermions emitted by a schwarzschild - de sitter black hole with a small positive cosmological constant @xmath44 . we have found that the fermion greybody factors can be approximated by constant quantities at low energies .",
    "this result is similar to the one derived for scalar particles @xcite .",
    "our analytical results presented here seems to confirm the numerical studies reported in ref.@xcite for very small energies .",
    "another important aspect encapsulated in our results is the fact that the ratio fermions to scalars ( which is approximatively 1/12 ) emitted by a sds black hole is smaller than the same ratio@xcite ( 1/8 ) in the case of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "this work can be continued in a number of ways such as : taking into account the next order terms in solving the equation in the intermediate region presented in section 3.2 and thus possible obtaining the energy dependence of the greybody factors ; finding more accurate solutions in the regions near the black hole and cosmological horizons and thus refining the results presented here .",
