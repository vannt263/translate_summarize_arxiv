    "currently developed mean - field theories based on energy density functionals ambitiously aim to properly explain a large range of nuclear properties and in many fields they have been quite successful . in this paper",
    "i present the results of applying of the unedf0 functional @xcite to describe low - energy collective excitations in the chain of even - even isotopes .",
    "the treatment of collective properties is based on the adiabatic time dependent hfb ( atdhfb ) theory , which leads to a construction of a collective hamiltonian from a microscopic , mean - field , input .",
    "more details of the applied methods can be found in @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to collective phenomena within a microscopic theory with phenomenological interactions employs the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "one should also mention an attempt to describe collective phenomena , in the rpa context however , starting form realistic interactions and using the unitary correlation operator method ( ucom ) @xcite .    for many years",
    "xe nuclei have been subject of extensive experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "many of them were focused on a phenomenon of the double @xmath0 decay ( confirmed experimentally in the case of ) but there is also a rich literature concerning the collective properties related to changes of nuclear deformation .",
    "the long chain of xe isotopes offers a good opportunity to study the evolution of these properties as the number of neutrons increases as well as the role of nonaxiality .",
    "let me mention only a few works which studied one or more of the even - even xe isotopes : papers employing geometrical concepts and the bohr hamiltonian @xcite , papers based on the interacting boson model @xcite , papers using truncated shell model space @xcite",

    "show the results of calculations concerning several low - spin energy levels , some e2 transitions in the nuclei as well as the comparison with experimental data .",
    "a consistent description of nuclear vibrational and rotational excitations as well as of possible couplings between them requires the use of quadrupole collective variables i.e. of the second rank with respect to the so(3 ) rotation group .",
    "such variables can be chosen in various ways , e.g. as parameters describing the shape of a nucleus @xcite or the shape of a phenomenological one - particle potential @xcite . within a self - consistent mean field theory",
    "such quadrupole variables @xmath1 ( in the laboratory frame ) are chosen so as to be proportional to the components of the quadrupole mass tensor @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a microscopic nuclear wave function which can be obtained by using effective interactions of the skyrme @xcite or the gogny type @xcite or in the relativistic framework ( rmf ) @xcite .",
    "the quadrupole variables can be equivalently expressed in the intrinsic frame ( also called principal axes frame ) by two deformation variables @xmath0 , @xmath4 and three euler angles ( @xmath5 ) describing the relative orientation of the laboratory and intrinsic frame . the @xmath0",
    ", @xmath4 variables are given by mean values of the operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 as follows @xmath8 with a conventional factor @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11  fm .",
    "one should keep in mind that in some theoretical approaches , e.g. in the geometrical collective ( frankfurt ) model @xcite , the deformation variables @xmath0 , @xmath4 do not have a direct relation to a nuclear shape or mass distribution . within a framework of the interacting boson model @xcite the @xmath0",
    ", @xmath4 variables introduced by means of the so called coherent states are related rather with properties of valence nucleons and not of a spatial distribution of a nuclear density .",
    "the general properties of the quadrupole collective space as well as of functions and operators depending on the quadrupole variables can be found e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the most important , from the point of view of physical applications , is a hamiltonian which we call the general bohr hamiltonian ( gbh ) and which can be expressed in the intrinsic frame as [ eq : gbh ] h_bohr = t_vib+t_rot+ v @xmath12 + \\right .",

    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : gbh ] ) contains seven functions that depend on deformation variables : the potential energy @xmath14 and six functions @xmath15 , called mass parameters or inertial functions .",
    "one possible way to determine these seven functions consists in assuming for them a reasonable form with some free parameters which are determined through comparison of calculated and experimental collective properties .",
    "i use another approach which is based on the atdhfb ( adiabatic time dependent hfb ) theory and which aims at calculating these functions starting from a microscopic theory . in this approach",
    "one does not introduce any additional free parameters and the prediction of collective properties is based solely on the knowledge of effective nucleon - nucleon interactions .      in the following discussion",
    "it is assumed that the time evolution of a system is determined through a time dependence of several collective variables @xmath16 ( not necessarily the quadrupole ones from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bet1]-[eq : bet2 ] ) ) .",
    "the atdhfb theory , based on an assumption of low collective velocities , gives an expression @xmath17 which is bilinear in velocities and which defines a metric tensor in the collective space . in the next step",
    "this expression is used to calculate the laplace - beltrami operator which is taken ( up to the @xmath18 factor ) as a kinetic energy part of a collective hamiltonian .",
    "functions @xmath19 ( mass parameters ) depend on collective variables .",
    "more details on the atdhfb theory and mass parameters can be found in e.g. @xcite and papers cited therein .",
    "below i briefly sketch some steps and give some formulas which are needed to calculate the general bohr hamiltonian starting from the unedf0 energy functional .",
    "the so called cranking approximation ignores the thouless - valatin terms so that the mass parameters can be conveniently expressed through derivatives of a generalized density matrix @xmath20 corresponding to the hfb state @xmath21 .",
    "the derivative @xmath22 in the quasi - particle basis ( in the doubled space ) has the form ( r)_quasipart = f_k=0 & f_k + _ k & 0 ,  _ k =- f^*_k and the mass parameters read b_kj= _ where @xmath23 are quasi - particle energies .",
    "if the matrix @xmath22 is known in a fixed single - particle basis the matrix @xmath24 can be calculated as f_k= ( _ q_k r)_fixed , doubled ^+ where @xmath25 is the bogolyubov matrix for @xmath26 = u^+ & v^+ + v^t & u^t .",

    "obtains the deformation - dependent hfb state by constrained hfb calculations [ eq : cons]| h_micr| = 0   | q_j | = q_j ,  j=0,2 then , it is easier first to discuss the vibrational mass parameters @xmath29 from which @xmath30 in the formulas ( [ eq : tvib]-[eq : wwr ] ) can be calculated by a simple change of variables .",
    "the required derivatives @xmath31 should be calculated by numerical differentiation ( see @xcite ) but most often one resorts to another ( so called perturbative ) approximation which relates the derivatives of the generalized density matrix to derivatives of the induced one - body hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the constraints ( eq [ eq : cons ] ) lead to the extra term @xmath32 in the induced one - body hamiltonian and one can easily calculate a derivative with respect to @xmath33 : ( f__j)_=(w_j ) _ ,  where [ eq : www ] w_j = u^+(q_j)_fixedv^*-(u^+(q_j)_fixedv^*)^t then , the derivatives @xmath31 are calculated using the relation r= _ j r and finally the derivatives @xmath34 are obtained by inverting the matrix @xmath35 , which can also be expressed through @xmath36 , eq ( [ eq : www ] ) = _ .",
    "the moments of inertia are given by the inglis - belyaev formula [ eq : momin ] j_k= _ , where @xmath37 is a matrix of the microscopic total angular momentum .",
    "in the case of the bcs approximation when the canonical basis is used formulas ( [ eq : www ] , [ eq : momin ] ) can be transformed to a simpler and better known form but in the general hfb approach ( [ eq : www ] , [ eq : momin ] ) are more useful .      to construct the mean - field configurations i used the unedf0 energy density functional , which is one of the results of a large scale project unedf @xcite . the functional is described in detail in @xcite and here i will elaborate only on some of its distinctive features . in the particle - hole channel unedf0",
    "is a standard skyrme - type functional @xcite with the spin - orbit term treated as in the ski parametrization @xcite .",

    "the pairing strengths for protons and neutrons , @xmath40 are fitted simultaneously with other parameters determining the functional .",
    "a truncation of the quasi - particle space , required due to a zero - range of the pairing interaction is fixed by the condition for quasi - particle energies @xmath41 . because it is well known that the atdhfb mass parameters are quite sensitive to a diffuseness of the occupation number distribution i shall now present more details on the treatment of the pairing part of unedf0 .",
    "the binding energies of the considered xe isotopes are reproduced quite well by the unedf0 functional .",
    "the rmsd ( root mean square deviation ) for 16 nuclei is equal to 0.454  mev with the largest error @xmath42  mev for the isotope .",
    "the chain of isotopes contains with a magic number @xmath43 of neutrons but it appears that due to the lipkin - nogami ( ln ) prescription the changes of the pairing properties along the chain are quite smooth .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ fig : pairprop ] where i plot the neutron and proton pairing energy vs the mass number .",
    "in addition i show a plot of the quantity @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is a coefficient determined in the ln method .",
    "this quantity can be treated as an estimation of the pairing gap within the ln method , for more details see @xcite .",

    "plot of the pairing energy ( upper panel ) and of the effective pairing gap @xmath47 calculated for protons ( ) and neutrons ( ) at the deformation corresponding to a minimum of the potential energy . ]    in conclusion i want to mention two newer functionals unedf1 @xcite and unedf2 @xcite which were constructed by extending the empirical dataset used in the fitting procedure . in the case of the unedf1 functional new data on a few fission isomers",
    "was added while for the unedf2 several single - particle level splittings were additionally considered .",
    "however , the rmsd for binding energies is significantly lower ( around 1.4 mev ) for unedf0 than for unedf1 and unedf2 ( around 1.9 mev ) hence the unedf0 functional seems to be a good choice for a pilot study of collective properties in the region of medium - heavy nuclei .",
    "a further detailed study on the consequences of unedf1 and unedf2 for collective nuclear properties is currently in progress .",
    "the values of inertial functions and potential energy which enter the general bohr hamiltonian were calculated at 144 points forming a regular grid in the sextant @xmath48 in the deformation plane .",
    "the distance between the points is 0.05 and @xmath49 in the @xmath50 and @xmath51 directions , respectively .",
    "the mean - field wave functions were obtained using the code hfodd ver .",
    "2.49 t , see @xcite and references therein .      as can be seen in",
    "there are three nuclei with a spherical minimum of the potential energy .",
    "others exhibit deformed minima with @xmath52 in the range @xmath53 , mostly on the prolate axis except for and which have slightly nonaxial minima with @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "the depths of the minima ( relative to a spherical shape ) are less than @xmath56  mev . in figures  [ fig : potf1 ] and [ fig : potf2 ] i show full plots of the potential energy on the deformation space for a representative sample of four isotopes . one can notice a rather weak dependence of the potential energy on the @xmath4 variable ( @xmath4 softness ) , especially for lighter isotopes .",
    "( a )    ( b )              having calculated the potential energy and mass parameters i performed a numerical diagonalization of the resulted bohr hamiltonian using the method described in @xcite .",
    "the obtained eigenvalues can be directly compared with excited energy levels of positive parity and the corresponding collective wave functions can be then used to calculate matrix elements of various operators , in particular of the operators of electromagnetic e2 transitions .",
    "i should add that all mass parameters ( vibrational and rotational ) were multiplied before the diagonalization of the bohr hamiltonian by a constant factor @xmath57 .",
    "the commonly quoted reasons for introducing such a factor refer to a simulation of the effects of including the thouless - valatin terms in the atdhfb method or / and the effects of the so called pairing vibrations , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "some rather crude estimations of these effects give the value of the factor in the range @xmath58 .",
    "however , due to a lack of sufficiently quantitative calculations this factor must be treated as an additional parameter of the theory .",
    "before presenting the results for the whole chain of xe isotopes i will show consequences of introducing the scaling factor for energy spectra and b(e2 ) probabilities in the case of .",
    "contains plots of bands built on @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 levels .",
    "there are two sets of theoretical results : obtained with the scaling factor ( @xmath62 ) and without the scaling ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "one can see that the scaling produces a shrinking of the spectra leaving a general picture similar in both cases .",
    "in addition , one can see that the scaling leads to a better agreement with experimental data ( showed in as well ) .",
    "a sample of @xmath64 results ( theoretical with and without scaling and experimental ) is shown in .",
    "the sample contains cases with both good and worse agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "it can be seen that the effect of the scaling the mass parameters is much smaller on the b(e2 ) probabilities than on the values of level energies .",
    "energy levels in .",
    "comparison of theoretical results obtained using the scaling of mass parameters ( @xmath62 ) , without such scaling ( @xmath63 ) and experimental data . ]    selected e2 transitions in the nucleus .",
    "theoretical results with the scaling factor ( @xmath62 ) , without one ( @xmath63 ) and experimental data @xcite are shown with ( ) , ( ) and ( ) , respectively ]    then i compare theoretical energies of several low lying low spin levels ( @xmath65 ) with experimental data @xcite for the considered chain of xe isotopes . these levels were chosen because of their role in analysing the band structure of nuclear spectra .",
    "one can conclude from plots in figures [ fig : lev21]-[fig:03 ] that in general the theoretical results are in good agreement with experimental data , especially for the lighter part of the isotope chain ( up to @xmath66 ) .",
    "one should also keep in mind that i do not fit any parameters to collective properties .",
    "some significant discrepancies in the vicinity of @xmath43 number of neutrons are not unexpected because the atdhfb theory tends to perform better for more collective nuclei , i.e. with a larger number of valence nucleons ( let us recall that there are only four valence protons in xe isotopes ) .",
    "this effect is connected with an assumption of adiabatic motion of all nucleons in the varying mean - field .",
    "this assumption is strongly affected by a presence of closed shells .",

    "a detailed analysis of experimental data on electromagnetic transitions can provide important information about excited levels , see e.g. @xcite . in the case of quadrupole excitations",
    "the most important are e2 transitions which are described by the collective operator @xmath72 i present the results of calculations of the b(e2 ) reduced transition probabilities for transitions @xmath73 and @xmath74 as well as their comparison with evaluated experimental data from @xcite in figures [ fig : e2fi ] and [ fig : e2se ] .",
    "again one can see that theoretical calculations reproduce the general behaviour of b(e2 ) quite well even as no free parameters ( e.g. effective charges ) were used .",

    "experimental ( ) @xcite and theoretical ( ) b(e2 ) probability ( in w.u . ) for the transition @xmath76 level in the nuclei . ]    in the case of some xe isotopes there are much more extensive experimental data on e2 transitions , see e.g. for @xcite and for @xcite but i postpone a discussion of them to a subsequent publication .",
    "the paper presents the results of the first attempt to apply the unedf0 energy functional to the theory of a nuclear collective motion .",
    "a correct description of the properties of the long chain of xe isotopes considered is a demanding challenge to the theory , in particular to a framework with no free parameters that could be fitted to experimental data on collective levels .",
    "it can be argued that the results shown in are quite satisfactory and reproduce well the general tendencies seen in the energy spectra as well as e2 transitions in the xe isotopes , with some exceptions around the semi - magic isotope .",
