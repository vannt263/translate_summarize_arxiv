    "the thermodynamics of black holes has been studied extensively since the work of hawking @xcite .",
    "the notion of critical behaviour has arisen in several contexts for black holes , ranging from the hawking - page @xcite phase transition in hot anti - de - sitter space and the pioneering work by davies @xcite on the thermodynamics of kerr - newman black holes , to the idea that the extremal limit of various black hole families might themselves be regarded as genuine critical points @xcite . as for standard statistical mechanical systems ,",
    "critical points are signalled by singularities in the specific heat .",
    "more recently , various groups have investigated the application of ideas from information geometry to the study of black hole thermodynamics .",
    "the use of information geometry @xcite in statistical mechanics in general was largely pioneered by ruppeiner @xcite and weinhold @xcite , who suggested that the curvature of a metric defined on the space of parameters of a statistical mechanical theory could provide information about the phase structure .",
    "specifically , from consideration of fluctuations , ruppeiner suggested a metric based on the entropy @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the entropy , @xmath2 is the mass and @xmath3 are the other extensive thermodynamic variables of the theory under consideration .",
    "it was found that the curvature of this metric was zero for a non - interacting theory such as an ideal gas , but non - zero for an interacting theory such as a van der waals gas , and divergent at the phase transition points @xcite .",
    "the ruppeiner metric is conformally related to the weinhold metric @xcite by where @xmath4 is the temperature of the system under consideration .",
    "this weinhold metric is defined as the hessian of the energy ( mass ) with respect to entropy and other extensive parameters , namely for non - black - hole systems , the results from using either metric have proved to be consistent @xcite , but consideration of different black hole families under various assumptions has led to numerous puzzling results for both metrics and inconsistencies between them @xcite .",
    "wei _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have recently added to this catalogue of inconsistencies by examining the ruppeiner metric and curvature for the kehagias - sfetsos ( ks ) black hole in hoava - lifschitz gravity ( hl ) and finding no singularity in the curvature at a point where a direct calculation of the specific heat does indicate a singularity .",
    "the legendre invariant metric suggested by quevedo _ et.al .",
    "_ @xcite has proved more successful in capturing the phase structure of other black hole families than the ruppeiner metric , and in this note we calculate the quevedo metric and curvature for the ks black hole using both the entropy and mass as the thermodynamic potential .    in the sequel",
    "we first briefly define the action for hoava - lifschitz gravity and sketch the ks black hole solution .",
    "we then describe the ruppeiner metric for the ks black holes , before moving on to the quevedo metric in both the entropy and mass representation .",
    "an explicit expression @xmath5 for the ks black hole is presented , which is useful in calculating the metric and basic thermodynamic quantities . in conclusion ,",
    "the general features of the scaling of the quevedo curvature and their origin are highlighted .",
    "the suggestion by hoava @xcite that an anisotropic theory of gravity at a lifshitz point @xcite might offer a viable quantum field theory of gravity while still retaining the properties of einstein gravity in the ir has led to an explosion of recent work .",
    "since the theory breaks general covariance to 3d spatial covariance plus time re - parametrization invariance it is most naturally couched in the ( 3 + 1 ) language of the adm @xcite formalism , where a general metric is written as @xmath6 the lapse and shift can then be used to construct the extrinsic curvature of the 3-space @xmath7 where the @xmath8 is the time derivative of the metric on the spatial slice .",
    "the hoava - lifshitz action may then be written as @xmath9 with @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are various constants and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the three - dimensional ricci tensor and ricci scalar .",
    "the cotton tensor for the three - geometry , which also appears , is defined as @xmath18 as it stands the generic ir vacuum of such a theory is anti - de sitter , but it is possible to deform the theory with an additional relevant operator @xmath19 , which allows a minkowski vacuum @xcite . using @xmath20 the ir limit of this augmented action matches the einstein - hilbert action @xmath21 in the limit @xmath22 and @xmath23 if @xmath24 the augmented action with @xmath25 considered in the limit @xmath22 is usually denoted  deformed hl gravity \" @xcite .",
    "in @xcite kehagias and sfetsos showed that the deformed hl gravity at @xmath23 admits a schwarzschild - like black hole solution , where a metric ansatz @xmath26 leads to @xmath27 @xmath2 is an integration constant which is related to the mass of the black hole , as can be seen by noting that @xmath28 when @xmath29 which is the standard schwarzschild behaviour .",
    "the ks black hole displays two event horizons at @xmath30 which is strikingly similar to the formula giving the event horizons in the reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black hole in standard einstein gravity @xmath31 or that for the kerr black hole @xmath32 this has led to the suggestion that @xmath33 should be treated as a charge - like parameter when considering the thermodynamics of the ks black hole @xcite .",
    "if one does this , the mass @xmath2 , hawking temperature @xmath4 and specific heat @xmath34 for the ks black hole may be written in a similar manner to those for the rn and kerr black holes giving @xcite @xmath35    the entropy may also be calculated and written in a beckenstein - smarr @xcite like manner , giving @xcite @xmath36 @xmath37 is a constant of integration which plays no role in the sequel .",
    "it is natural to set @xmath38 to match up with the schwarzschild limit .",
    "the singularity in the specific heat can be interpreted as signalling a phase transition at @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath40\\ ,   r_{-}\\ , \\ , $ ] , for the ks black hole .",
    "the ruppeiner metric components for the ks black hole were calculated by wei _",
    "_ @xcite using equ.([sks ] ) @xmath41 the ricci scalar for the ruppeiner metric is then found to be @xmath42 ^ 2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] but it fails to show a singularity at the point , @xmath43 , where the specific heat has a singularity in equ.([cks ] ) , although the pre - factor of the log term in the denominator does vanish at this point .",
    "in addition , it is neither zero nor singular in the extremal limit @xmath44 .",
    "the ks black hole thus adds a further example to the ( long ) list of peculiarities which arise when information geometry , in the form of the ruppeiner or weinhold metric , is applied to the thermodynamics of black holes .",
    "a possible resolution of such difficulties in general in the context of black hole thermodynamics was suggested by quevedo _",
    "_ @xcite . they argued that an important feature for thermodynamic metrics was legendre invariance , which was not a property of either the ruppeiner or weinhold metrics .",
    "they found consistent results for various black holes when using a legendre invariant metric definition , which agreed with direct calculations of phase transition points from the specific heat . in the next section",
    "we apply the formalism to the ks black hole .",
    "quevedo _ et al .",
    "_ s starting point @xcite was the observation that standard thermodynamics was invariant with respect to legendre transformations , since one expects consistent results whatever starting potential one takes , and they coined the name geometrothermodynamics for a formalism which ensured this . their work was based on the use of contact geometry as a framework for thermodynamics , developed by hermann @xcite , mrugaa @xcite and others .    for the geometrothermodynamics of black holes they considered a @xmath45 dimensional thermodynamic phase space @xmath46 with independent coordinates",
    "@xmath47 , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 represents the thermodynamic potential , and @xmath3 and @xmath50 are the extensive and intensive thermodynamic variables , respectively .",

    "we give it in the appendix for completeness .",
    "looking at the curvature @xmath74 we see that it diverges as @xmath75 , with @xmath76 , at the same point as the specific heat .",
    "the specific heat vanishes in the extremal limit , @xmath77 since @xmath78 and @xmath79 in this limit .",
    "this is also the case for the curvature in equ.([rksq ] ) calculated in the entropy representation , but this is not a generic feature , as we see in the next section by calculating the quevedo curvature using the mass as the thermodynamic potential .",
    "there is a degree of arbitrariness in the definition of the metric @xmath80 on @xmath81 ( and hence @xmath82 ) , since various choices will allow for the desired legendre invariance .",
    "different choices for the thermodynamic potential @xmath49 are also possible . in the preceding section we have taken @xmath83 , but",
    "@xmath84 would have been _ a priori _ equally valid .",
    "some of the properties such as the relation between the specific heat and curvature singularities of the quevedo metric are particularly apparent in this mass representation g^mq = ( s m_s + p m_p ) ( -m_ss d s^2 + m_pp dp^2 )  , [ gmq ] where , at the risk of overcomplicating the notation , we write the superscript @xmath85 to denote the use of the mass @xmath2 as the thermodynamic potential . in these variables the specific heat may be evaluated as @xmath86 and the presence of @xmath63 in the definition of @xmath87 ensures the absence of off - diagonal terms , @xmath88 and a @xmath89 factor in the resulting curvature .    for the rn and kerr black holes",
    "it is straightforward to express @xmath2 as a function of @xmath90 or @xmath91 using the beckenstein - smarr formulae [ msq ] m_rn(s , q ) = + m_kerr(s , j ) = ( ) ^1/2 .",
    "it is more difficult to write @xmath5 explicitly for the ks black hole using equ.([sks ] ) , but this may still be done using the lambert w function , which is the solution of w(x ) ( w(x ) ) = x , to give m_ks ( s , p ) = , [ mw ] where we have assumed that @xmath92 .",
    "choosing a non - zero constant simply shifts @xmath93 .    the specific heat calculated from @xmath94 in these variables for the ks black hole is c = .",
    "[ cksw ] rewriting this in terms of @xmath95 s reproduces ( as it should ) the expression for @xmath34 given in equ.([cks ] ) , which had been calculated previously @xcite using c = . the additional observation from solving equ.([mw ] ) for @xmath96 in terms of @xmath95 that @xmath96 is equal to @xmath97 is useful for rewriting equ.([cksw ] ) .",
    "the curvature of the quevedo metric in the mass representation for the ks black hole is a rather cumbersome expression , but it takes the form r^mq = where @xmath98 are neither singular nor zero at the zeros of the other factor in the denominator .",
    "this still shows clearly the correspondence between the specific heat and curvature singularities that is expected on general grounds , since substituting @xmath99 in the denominator recovers the same singular factor @xmath100 ^ 2 $ ] seen when the entropy is used as the thermodynamic potential .",
    "the behaviour of the quevedo metric for the ks black hole is thus identical to that of the rn and kerr black holes : the location of the singularities of the curvature match those of the specific heat in both the entropy and mass representations .",
    "with an explicit mass formula , equ.([mw ] ) , in hand it is also a straightforward matter to calculate the components of the weinhold metric for the ks black hole for comparison purposes with both the ruppeiner and quevedo metrics .",
    "other black hole families display inconsistencies between the specific heat singularities and those of the ruppeiner and weinhold curvatures .",
    "for example , with the rn black hole the ruppeiner geometry is flat , whereas the weinhold geometry is curved .",

    "@xmath104 does _ not _ diverge at the same point as the specific heat , @xmath72 , but rather at the extremal limit .",
    "interestingly , the factor in the denominator is identical to that appearing in the curvature of the ruppeiner metric , so the pre - factor of the @xmath105 disappears at that point . as for the ruppeiner metric",
    ", the weinhold metric does not reproduce the singular behaviour of the ks black hole specific heat .",
    "the ks black hole provides a further example of a system in which a particular choice of legendre invariant quevedo metric captures the phase structure in a manner which eludes the apparently physically well - motivated ruppeiner and weinhold metrics .",
    "it remains a puzzle as to why this behaviour manifests itself in various black hole models and is not apparent when the ruppeiner and weinhold metrics are used in the description of other , less esoteric , statistical mechanical systems . in the latter case",
    ", the use of a legendre invariant metric does not appear to be obligatory to find physically sensible results .",
    "the relation between the singularities of the specific heat and the thermodynamic curvature calculated with this quevedo metric is consistent for the black holes and choices of thermodynamic potential discussed here .",
    "if one accepts the premise that phase transitions appear as curvature singularities in the thermodynamic metric , none of the examples examined here and elsewhere using this particular definition have given rise to the sorts of inconsistencies which have dogged the application of ruppeiner and weinhold metrics in this field .",
    "the relation between the specific heat and thermodynamic curvature scaling is different to that seen for a continuous transition and the ruppeiner or weinhold metrics in standard statistical mechanical systems . in such transitions",
    "the ruppeiner curvature would be expected to diverge as the correlation volume , @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is some appropriate correlation length . if the standard scaling assumption @xmath108 holds , where @xmath109 at the critical point , @xmath110 .",
    "if , in addition , hyperscaling @xmath111 is also valid , we find @xmath112 , which relates the singularity of the specific heat @xmath113 to the singularity of the curvature .",
    "as we have seen , the specific heat for the black holes behaves as @xmath114 , but the thermodynamic curvature behaves as @xmath75 rather than @xmath115 .",
    "the picture which emerges from the use of a quevedo metric to investigate the thermodynamics of the ks black hole is thus that , provided @xmath116 is treated as a charge , both the specific heat and the curvature from the quevedo metric possess singularities when @xmath72 .",
    "the general behaviour is similar to other two parameter families such as the rn and kerr black holes , which is perhaps not so surprising given the similarities in the various thermodynamic formulae for the mass , charges and entropy .",
    "this consistency might also be taken as further evidence that the choice of @xmath117 as a charge - like variable and the resulting expression for @xmath1 containing a logarithmic term in equ.([sks ] ) is the correct way to reconcile the integral and differential forms dm = t ds + v_p dp of the first law of thermodynamics in the ks black hole @xcite .    as a final comment",
    ", we emphasize that that the quevedo metric in the form used here recovers the singularities seen in the specific heat because certain choices ( in particular , no off - diagonal elements @xmath118 ) have been made",
