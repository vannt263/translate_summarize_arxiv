    "mkn 421 is an x - ray selected closest ( z=0.03 ) bl lacertae object exhibiting extreme variability in vhe @xmath1ray emission .",
    "this is the first extra - galactic object discovered at tev energies [ @xcite ] .",
    "variability time scale as low as 15 minutes observed from this source [ @xcite ] implies a compact emission region of dimension @xmath2 less than @xmath3 pc which is only an order of magnitude larger than the radius of the event horizon of a @xmath4 solar mass black hole .",
    "correlations observed between x - rays and tev @xmath1rays [ @xcite are most easily explained as emissions at both wavelengths produced by the same population of high energy electrons .",
    "however models which produce @xmath1rays primarily through proton interactions [ @xcite ] can also explain the observations so far .",
    "more observations are still needed to understand the nature of the proginitors of tev @xmath1rays .",
    "pact is situated in the central indian hill station pachmarhi ( longitude : 78@xmath5 26@xmath6 e , latitude : 22@xmath5 28@xmath7 and altitude : 1075 @xmath8 ) .",
    "it consists of an array of erenkov detectors , each of area 4.35 @xmath9 , deployed in the form of a rectangular array .",
    "the detectors in the e - w direction have a separation of 25 @xmath8 and in the n - s direction separation is 20 @xmath8 .",
    "each telescope consists of 7 parabolic reflectors mounted para - axially on a single equatorial mount [ @xcite ] .",
    "the array has been divided into 4 sectors of six telescopes each and each sector has its own data acquisition system which are networked with the master data acquisition system .",
    "the analog signals from the seven individual mirrors of a telescope are added in phase to generate a ` royal sum ' .",
    "the trigger is generated when any 4 out of 6 royal sums are present in any sector . following an event trigger the tdc and",
    "the adc informations from peripheral mirrors of each telescopes , the utc from a real time clock and the latch information are recorded .",
    "the master recording system at the main control room records the tdc information from all royal sums [ @xcite ] .",
    "pact has become completely operational since december 2000 .",
    "two of the four sectors ( consisting of a total of 12 telescopes ) were ready about an year ago when the science observations were started .",
    "various celestial point sources of @xmath10-rays have been observed . among these are the galactic sources like the crab nebula , geminga and extra - galactic sources like mkn 421 and mkn 501 .",
    "we have detected positive signal from the crab nebula [ @xcite ] and the detected flux is consistent with the expected sensitivity of pact .",
    "the flaring blazar mkn 421 has been observed by pact ( using sectors 3 & 4 only during january 2000 flare and all the 4 sectors during the january 2001 flare ) .",
    "we have a total of 73.3 hrs of on - source date and 50.6 hrs of off - source data during the 2000 observing season while we have logged 45.6 hrs of on - source data and 39.7 hrs of off - source data until the end of february during 2001 observing season .",
    "from the vast amount of data we have carried out only a preliminary analysis of the january 2000 and 2001 data because of the flaring activity reported by other groups [ @xcite ]    the arrival direction of each event with more than 8 telescopes participating , has been estimated using a plane front approximation . in this preliminary analysis only the telescope tdc values are used .",
    "the tdc information from individual mirrors in a telescope are not used .",
    "the mean value of the @xmath11 values of the plane front fit to the tdc data is around 1 .",
    "we rejected events with @xmath11 values more than 1 standard deviation above the mean .",
    "the off - source data covering the same hour angle range as the corresponding on - source run is taken on the same night as the source run or the following night .",
    "on & off -source data segments are of same duration .",
    "the space angle between the direction of the primary estimated as mentioned above and the source or the off - source direction as the case may be is estimated for each accepted event .",
    "the space angle distributions are generated both for on & off source data .",
    "the two distributions are normalized from the number of counts in the space angle range @xmath12 and the off - source distribution is subtracted from the on - source distribution to estimate the @xmath0-ray signal from the source .",
    "different space angular ranges were used for normalization and the rms value of the estimated signal is used as a measure of systematic error on the signal .",
    "it has been found that the signal strength is not a sensitive function of space angle range used for normalization . in all cases",
    "the space angle distributions of the signal are similar , showing excess close to zero and reaching zero counts with increasing space    angle while the fwhm of this distribution is consistent with the angular resolution [ @xcite ] .",

    "these are shown as open squares and the error bars include systematic errors as mentioned above .",
    "also shown in the same figure are the counting rates above 250 gev from the cat imaging telescope ( shown as asterisks , @xcite ) .",
    "these rates are multiplied by a factor of 10 and re - plotted ( shown as diamonds ) for better comparison of the variability of the two independent results .",
    "it can be seen that the two light curves , one with primary @xmath0-ray @xmath13 250 gev [ @xcite ] and the other with primary @xmath0-ray @xmath13 900 gev are very similar .",
    "similarly , figure 2 shows the nightly rates of tev @xmath0-rays from mkn 421 above 900 gev from pact observations during january 2001 . also shown in the same plot",
    "are the @xmath0-ray ( @xmath13 500 gev ) count rate contemporaneously detected by hegra ct1 [ @xcite ] .",
    "figure 1 also shows a re - plot of the hegra ct1 rates multiplied by 5 as diamonds to enable one to compare the counting rate variability in the two independent observations . during both the episodes",
    "there is a good agreement between the two light curves despite different energy thresholds .",
    "it may be noted that this is only a preliminary result and hence we have not estimated the tev @xmath0-ray flux from this source during the flaring activity . the enhanced counting rate from pact as compared that from imaging telescopes , is attributed to its increased collection area .",
    "we have carried several checks to improve the confidence level of the signal seen by pact .",
    "a positive signal could result , for example , if the space angle distribution of background region has some systematic problem .",
    "hence we compared the background data taken during two different nights and after subtracting one from the other no positive excess was detected in any space angle range .",
    "in addition , we compared an on - source data with several nights background data separately and estimated the signal in each case .",
    "table 1 shows the systematic variation in the signal strength resulting from the systematic variation in the background data taken during different nights .",
    "in addition , each on / off source data set has been subdivided as per the number of telescopes that have participated during the event .",
    "each subset was independently analyzed and the signals estimated .",
    "the variation of signal strengths from segment to segment were consistent within the expected variation in each run .",
    "0.3 cm    .a table showing the consistency of signal strength with different backgrounds [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]         figure 3 shows the the space angle distribution of events when two sets of background data are compared .",
    "the space angle distribution of the ratio s show no evidence of any signal showing that the systematic variations , if any , in the background data can not masquerade as a @xmath0-ray signal .",
    "a variable tev @xmath0-ray signal above 900 gev has been detected by pact for the first time during both the episodes in january 200 and january 2001 .",
    "the variability measurements are compatible with those independently seen by other atmospheric erenkov telescopes .",
    "the fourth run taken in january 2000 did not show any signal once again confirming that pact analysis is working .",
    "however there are more data from this source to be analyzed .",
