    "investigation of raman spectra of the first order ( for ) in disordered ferroelectrics was shown to be sensitive method for studying of the critical slowing down of optic phonons nearby ferroelectric transition and dynamics of local fluctuation ( see e.g. @xcite and ref . therein ) .",
    "several attempts were made to explain for spectral anomalies such as strong increase of peak intensity in the vicinity of @xmath5 and peculiar shape of the line @xcite .",
    "however , up to now there is no general approach to the description of raman spectra in the disordered ferroelectrics nearby @xmath5 .",
    "these results are in the discrepancy in the values of the materials physical characteristics obtained from experimental data ( see e.g. @xcite -@xcite ) . the most promising way for development of general approach seems to be the model allowing for inhomogeneous broadening of for lines induced by static disorder and homogeneous broadening due to dynamic effects .",
    "the existence of both these contributions to raman spectra was shown early in @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "theory of inhomogeneously broadened lines in radio- , optic- and other spectroscopy methods was developed in many details early for conventional dielectric and magnetic systems @xcite . in these materials",
    "inhomogeneous broadening used to be temperature independent , so that only homogeneous broadening may be the source of temperature dependence of the spectra line shape and width . in the disordered ferroelectrics",
    "due to nonlinear and spatial correlation effects which is known to be especially strong in the vicinity of @xmath5 inhomogeneous broadening was recently shown to be temperature dependent @xcite .    in the present work a theory of for allowing for both linear and nonlinear contributions to inhomogeneous broadening as well as to homogeneous mechanisms of line broadening",
    "is developed .",
    "the theory explains the main peculiarities of observed for spectra in @xmath1 with 1% and 4% of @xmath10 @xcite and in @xmath2 with 15.7% of @xmath4 ions",
    "@xcite when the systems approach the phase transition from above .",
    "since in vicinity of the phase transition the nonlinear effects are known to be large enough our theory is more general than that in @xcite , where nonlinear and spatial correlation effects were not taken into account .",
    "the proposed theoretical approach allows to describe of the raman spectra ( in distingvish @xcite ) without calculation of the correlation function of the quasi - static polarization fluctuations but only suggesting about its spectral density form . because of generality of proposed theory",
    "it can be applied to many ferroelectrics in vicinity of transition temperature .",
    "2.1 incipient ferroelectric @xmath11 doped by @xmath3 or @xmath12 ions can have ferroelectric phase transition , mixed ferroglass phase and dipole glass state in dependence on temperature and the impurities concentrations @xcite .",
    "these materials can be regarded as the model systems of the disordered ferroelectrics .",
    "their peculiar properties are connected with off - center positions of @xmath3 and @xmath12 ions substituted for @xmath13 and @xmath14 ions respectively .",
    "some anomalies of raman spectra can be explained also by these ions off - centrality . in particular quasistatic polarization fluctuations induced by off - center ions",
    "can lead to the reduction of @xmath11 cubic symmetry and to the appearance of first order raman scattering ( for ) even above the transition temperature @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the most detail description of the appeareance of the single phonon raman lines above @xmath5 can be found in @xcite where it was shown how the slow finite - range precursor order , dominant near the phase transition , is responsible for the persistence of quasi - first - order hard - mode features above @xmath5 .",
    "as known , raman scattering in perovskite ferroelectrics is caused by the changes in the oxygen electrtonic polarizability @xmath15 induced by optic vibration modes of the lattice .",
    "this changes can be written in the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 represents the space- and time - dependent polarization fluctuation and @xmath18 is a fourth - rank tensor .",
    "equation ( 1 ) usually describes second - order raman scattering .",
    "however , if we write the fluctuation polarization as a sum over the components due to the polar hard modes @xmath19 and slow relaxing component @xmath20 we can explain the appearance of single - phonon raman scattering above @xmath5 considering the cross terms @xmath21 in the eq.(1 ) the scattering intensity is given by the spatial and temperature fourier components of the polarizability correlation function @xmath22 because the first correlation function has a sharp maximum near @xmath23 and second one near @xmath24 , @xmath25 is sharply peaked at @xmath26 , i.e. , near the hard single - phonon frequency .    it is seen that ( [ 2 ] ) can be represented as the convolution of the functions represented inhomogeneous and homogeneous mechanisms of broadening connected respectively with the first and the second correlators and so it can be written in the form @xmath27 the detailed form of homogeneuos @xmath28 and inhomogeneous contribution @xmath29 can be obtained by the following way .",
    "thermal lattice vibrations usually lead to homogeneous broadening with simple lorentzian shape , i.e. @xmath30 which should be valid for the difference of frequencies @xmath31 close to hard phonon frequency @xmath32 . on the other hand the correlation function of quasistatic polarization reads @xmath33 substituting ( long - wave approximation ) @xmath34 and performing some transformation one obtaine that @xmath35 @xmath36 equations ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) determine respectively the contribution of inhomogeneous and homogeneous broadening into raman line shape ( see eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) ) .",
    "however it is seen from eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) , that for @xmath37 calculation one has to calculate firstly the correlation function of polarization .",
    "its calculation utilized some special models and supposition @xcite . to our mind",
    "more general approach for @xmath37 calculation can be statistical theory of specrtal line shape @xcite .",
    "this theory was sucsessfully applied for description of optic , radiospectrroscopy , @xmath38-resonance etc .",
    "line shapes @xcite .",
    "2.2 the shape of @xmath37 was calculated in the statistical theory framework for the cases when the frequency shift of spectral line is linear @xcite and nonlinear @xcite function of random fields .",
    "the latter case seems to be especially important for disordered ferroelectrics at @xmath39 , @xmath40 , where nonlinear and correlation effects is known to be large enough . as a matter of fact the distribution function allowing for these effects",
    "can be expressed via linear one in the framework of the general theory of probability which makes it possible to write down the distribution of one random quantity via that of another if the relation between these quantities is known @xcite .",
    "for example in the simplest case when the random quantity @xmath41 is a single - valued monotonous function of another random quantity @xmath42 then the relation between their distribution functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be written as @xcite @xmath45 in general case when several different @xmath41 values correspond to the same @xmath46 value the space of @xmath41 should be devided into the regions where the function @xmath46 is monotonous .",
    "for the entire @xmath41-domain distribution function @xmath43 can be represented as a sum of terms like eq.(8 ) @xcite .",
    "since the distribution function in the case of linear contribution of the random field @xmath47 can be analytically calculated in statistical theory approach @xcite we have to express via it the distribution function allowing for nonlinear random field contribution .",
    "let us suppose that the shift @xmath48 of the spectral line maximum position @xmath49 due to random field contribution can be written as a power law ( up to some @xmath50 power ) of the random field @xmath51 @xmath52 equation ( 9 ) makes it possible to express the distribution function of @xmath53 via that of @xmath51 in the form @xcite",
    "@xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the real roots of the algebraic equation @xmath57 it is seen , that @xmath50 order distribution function @xmath58 is expressed via that calculated in linear approximation when all nonlinear coefficients equal zero , i.e. @xmath59 . shape of @xmath47 calculated in the statistical theory approach was shown to be gaussian , lorentzian or holtzmarkian in dependence on types of random field sources with parameters determined by the sources concentrations and characteristics @xcite .    in the simplest case , when the main contribution is connected with the first nonlinear term in eqs .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) , ( [ 11 ] ) ( @xmath60 ) eqs.(10 ) , ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) lead to the following form of the normalized second order distribution function @xmath61 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the teta - function , so that @xmath63 only in region @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) or @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) , @xmath68 is a critical frequency at which a divergency of @xmath69 appears .",
    "therefore @xmath69 is strongly asymmetrical , and its form at @xmath70 ( the wing of @xmath69 ) is the following @xmath71 let us consider the homogeneous contribution in the lorentzian form ( see eq.(7 ) ) . in this case the integration in eq.([3 ] ) is equivalent to substitution @xmath72 for @xmath53 in the eq.([13 ] ) ( @xmath73 is half width on the half height ) .",
    "if there are several mechanisms of homogeneous broadening with lorentzian forms @xmath74 , where @xmath75 numerates the mechanisms .    the aforementioned procedure ( or integration in eq.([3 ] ) ) with respect to eq.([13 ] ) in supposition that @xmath47 has gaussian form , i.e. @xmath76 leads to the following shape of spectral line in the considered case @xmath77 \\cos{\\frac{4\\alpha _ { 2}/\\tau -s_{2}(\\omega ) } { 8\\alpha _ { 2}^{2}\\delta ^{2 } } } \\right .",

    "it is seen that homogeneous contribution transforms @xmath69 divergence at @xmath81 into sharp maximum , so that the spectral line has two maxima ( see fig .",
    "1 ) instead of one in the linear case origin of high frequency one being connected with gaussian form .",
    "the distance between two maxima approximately equals @xmath82 ( see fig .  1 ) . at large enough nonlinear contribution",
    "only sharp maximum at @xmath83 conserves , its width increases with @xmath84 increasing ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the left hand side half - width of low - frequency peak completely defined by homogeneous broadening mechanisms , meanwhile right hand side part of the line at @xmath85 defines mainly by inhomogeneous mechanism contribution .",
    "3.1 the developed theory was applied to recently observed @xmath86 for in @xmath1 with 1% and 4% of @xmath3 and in @xmath2 with 15.7% of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "let us begin with the consideration of raman spectra in @xmath1 .",
    "measurements were carried out at @xmath87  k ( @xmath88 ) and @xmath89  k ( @xmath90 ) @xcite . in both samples the observed line was strongly asymmetric with maximum at @xmath91 .",
    "these lines were fitted good enough by eqs . ( 12 ) - ( 14 ) with the following dimensionless parameters @xmath92 , @xmath93 ( fig .  3 ) and @xmath94 , @xmath95 ( fig .",
    "4 ) for the considered @xmath3 concentrations respectively .    the position of the lines maxima @xmath96 is defined by the parameter of nonlinearity in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "we obtained @xmath97  cm by the fitting of the high frequency line tails with the eq.(15 ) .",
    "this value gives @xmath98 with the reference point @xmath99 .",
    "note that eq.(15 ) describes also observed frequency dependence of the lines tails for the same @xmath100 value .",
    "this made it possible to obtaine yhe magnitude of the gaussian width @xmath101 with the help of aforemationed @xmath79 values : @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) and @xmath104 ( @xmath105 .",
    "in accordance with our theory the line form at @xmath106 defines completely by homogeneous mechanism contribution represented by eq.(4 ) .",
    "it is seen that low - frequency half - width @xmath84 is connected with hard phonon life time @xmath107 . keeping in mind the obtained values of @xmath108 and",
    "@xmath101 one find @xmath109 ( @xmath87  k ) @xmath110 , @xmath109 ( @xmath89  k ) @xmath111 .",
    "these date are in resonable agreement with ordinary values of hard phonon life times and with observed low - frequency half - width ( see figs 3 , 4 ) .",
    "3.2 now let us proceed to consideration of raman spectra in @xmath2 with 15.7% @xmath12 which has the transition from cubic to tetragonal phase at @xmath112  k. the measurements were carried out at several temperatures in vicinity of @xmath5 : @xmath113 , 150 , 146 and 142  k @xcite . at all the temperatures the lines with two maxima",
    "were observed , the first being nearby @xmath114 and the second at @xmath115 .",
    "the intensity of low frequency maximum essentially increased with @xmath116 lowering , meanwhile the intensity of high frequency one became very small at @xmath117  k. since nonlinear parameter @xmath118 increases with temperature approaching to @xmath5 @xcite , nonlinear effects has to be the largest at @xmath117  k. qualitatively transformation of spectra from two - peak line to one - sharp peak line at nonlinear parameter increasing is in agreement with theoretical overcasting ( see figs.1 , 2 ) it is seen also that increasing of low frequency maximum intensity with @xmath116 lowering can be the result of @xmath84 decreasing .    to be sure that nonlinear effects are really responsible for observed raman spectra transformation we checked if the eqs.(13 - 15 ) fitted experimental spectra .",
    "it was shown that eq.([15 ] ) fitted the wing ( @xmath119 ) of raman line at @xmath117  k for @xmath120 , which lead to @xmath121 ( see eq .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) ) .",
    "this value fits pretty good the distance between two peaks of observed raman spectra ( see fig .  5 ) , which speaks in favour of nonlinear effects contribution . in fig .",
    "5a we depicted line shape calculated with the help of eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) for @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "the later quantity was taken from measured high frequency maximum width .",
    "note , that obtained @xmath101 value made it possible to fit dimensionless @xmath124 scale with @xmath53 scale in fig .",
    "5 and later in fig .",
    "the values of homogeneous broadening parameter @xmath84 at different t were calculated in supposition that it defines mainly by reorientational frequency of elastic dipole connected with @xmath12 .",
    "this frequency temperature dependence was measured early @xcite and it was described by arrenius law @xmath125 with u=200 k and @xmath126  hz . at @xmath127",
    "k eq.([13 ] ) leads to the value @xmath128 , which was used in calculation of the line , depicted in fig .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "5 that the calculation and observed spectra look like one another.more detailed comparison of the theory and experiment was carried out for raman line observed at @xmath117  k ( see fig .",
    "theoretical curve was drawn for aforementioned parameter @xmath129  cm , obtained from line wing behaviour and @xmath84 was calculated with the help of eq.([18 ] ) .",
    "it is seen that theory fits pretty good observed raman spectra .",
    "this gave evidence that measured raman line asymmetry and rapid change in line shape when approaching the transition from above is really connected with nonlinear effects in @xmath2 with 15.7% @xmath12 .",
    "theory overcasts strong increasing of low frequency peak at the region @xmath130 because of @xmath100 increasing and @xmath84 decreasing in supposition that there is no another even small temperature independent contribution to @xmath84 .    comparing the obtained data for @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "one can see that because the reorientation rate of @xmath12 dipoles is much larger than that of @xmath3 , the homogeneous broadening of raman line in @xmath1 is defined by hard phonon dynamic whereas in @xmath2 - by @xmath12 elastic moment reorintation .",
    "note that in @xcite the reorientation of @xmath12 electric dipole moment were supposed to be the origin of the homogeneous broadening .",
    "however the parameters of the electric dipoles orientations obtained from fitting of the theory with the experiment were strongly different from those obtained early in independent measurements @xcite .",
    "the proposed theoretical description of raman spectra shapes was perfomed without calculation of correlation function of quasy - static fluctuation of polarization .",
    "the comparison with the caculations of raman spectra based on calculation of this correlation function shows that the parameter @xmath131 corresponds to @xmath132 where @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 are , respectively , a sound velosity , hard mode frequency at @xmath136 and the correlation length of the polarisation in the pure lattice .",
    "these physical quantities define temperature and concentrational dependence of obtained values of @xmath79 .",
    "the value of parameter @xmath137 ( @xmath138 is correlation radius of the lattice with impurities ) defines the ratio of inhomogeneous and homogeneous contributions and at @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) the line becomes completely inhomogeneous @xcite . in our approach",
    "the parameter of nonlinearity strongly increases with @xmath139 and becomes much greater than homogeneous contribution which tends to decrease the magnitude of line maximum .",
    "therefore qualititavely our results are in agreement with those obtained in @xcite .    however comparing the frequency dependence of @xmath141 at large @xmath53",
    "one can see that it was described as @xmath142 @xcite whereas in our theory as @xmath143 .",
    "more accurate measurements of line intensity decay could be desirable for both theory comparison .",
    "moreover , our theory gives the line shape with two maxima for intermidiate values of @xmath79 , which looks like that observed in @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "thus the observed line shape with two maxima naturally appeares in our theory whereas the second maximum was not obtained in the previous theoretical description @xcite .",
    "its origin was supposed to be some forbidden transition related to the mixture of acoustic and optic modes .",
    "therefore peculiarities of raman spectra shape were explained by proposed theory . in particular it was shown that nonlinear effects leads to strong assymetry of the lines and to appearing of the low frequency sharp maximum , its left hand side is defined by dynamic properties of the system .",
    "the division between dynamic and static characteristics contribution into raman spectra shape makes possible to investigate separately the both aforementioned characteristics by raman spectroscopy method .",
