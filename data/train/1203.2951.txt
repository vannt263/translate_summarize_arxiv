    "we consider a network @xmath0 of computer data centers on the earth surface .",

    "the data centers provide a variety of cloud computing services to a big set of users @xmath6 our main goal will be to solve the _ minimization problem for the total distance _ @xmath7 between the data centers and the users .",
    "we assume that each user @xmath8 is assigned to a data center @xmath9 , and the total distance is the sum of the distances between the users and the corresponding data centers , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the function assigning the user @xmath8 to the data center @xmath9 .    for any two points @xmath12 on the sphere",
    "we denote @xmath13 the distance between @xmath14 and @xmath15 on the sphere , that is the length of the arc of the great circle connecting @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "we will consider the problem of the minimization of the total distance under certain constraints .",
    "we will assume that each data center @xmath16 has a capacity @xmath17 which characterizes how many users it can service .",
    "the assumption of the limited capacity for the data centers leads to the minimization problem with constraints : find an assignment function @xmath18 such that @xmath19 where @xmath20 observe that @xmath21 is just the number of users assigned to the data center @xmath3 .",
    "since the number of users is usually large , it can be useful to consider a ( nonnegative ) measure @xmath22 of users on the sphere . in this case , the total distance functional looks like @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the assignment function of the users to the data centers . respectively",
    ", constraint takes the form @xmath25    the main result of this work is theorem 2.1 , in which we prove that the solution to minimization problem is given by a hyperbolic voronoi diagram on the sphere .",
    "the classical voronoi diagrams have numerous applications to science and technology ( for many of these applications see the review paper @xcite by aurenhammer , the lectures @xcite by mller , the collection of papers @xcite , the monograph @xcite of okabe , boots , sugihara , and chiu , and references therein ) . for applications of voronoi diagrams to cloud computing see the recent paper @xcite of shouraboura and bleher and references therein . in our theorem 2.1",
    "we show that the presence of the constraints leads to an extension of the classical voronoi diagrams to hyperbolic voronoi diagrams on the sphere .",
    "it is interesting to notice that in a completely different setting similar diagrams on the plane or in the 3d space appear in crystallography as the johnson - mehl model of the crystal growth @xcite .",
    "we formulate and prove theorem 2.1 in section [ cmp ] .",
    "in the subsequent section we illustrate theorem 2.1 by results of computer simulations .",

    "the sets @xmath28 are disjoint and they form a measurable partition @xmath29 of the sphere @xmath1 , so that @xmath30 the functional @xmath31 reduces to @xmath32 and constraint to @xmath33    let us begin with the unconstrained minimization problem . in the absence of the capacity constraint",

    "geometrically , we partition the sphere @xmath1 into the cells @xmath37 of the voronoi diagram @xmath38 on the sphere with the points @xmath39 . the cell @xmath40 is defined as the set of points on @xmath1 which are closer ( or at the same distance ) to @xmath3 than to other @xmath41 s , that is @xmath42 observe that the cells @xmath37 are convex spherical polygons on the sphere @xmath1 . with the voronoi diagram",

    "thus , in the absence of the constraint , we assign to each data center @xmath46 all users in the cell @xmath40 of the voronoi diagram . to describe the assignment in the presence of the constraint we introduce hyperbolic voronoi diagrams on the sphere .",
