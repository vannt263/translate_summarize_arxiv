    "the current implementation is carried out with standard double floating point arithmetic without analyzing effects of round - off errors . for a variant of the algorithm that facilitates rigorous error control see  @xcite .",

    "while path jumping can be detected , in principle , _ a posteriori _ and the continuation rerun with tighter tolerances and smaller step sizes , the path crossing can not be determined easily .",
    "path crossing does not result in an incorrect set of target solutions ; however , for certain homotopy - based algorithms such as _ numerical irreducible decomposition _",
    "@xcite and applications relying on _ monodromy _ computation such as  @xcite the order of the target solutions is crucial .",
    "therefore , one not only needs to certify the end points of homotopy paths , but also has to show that the approximating sequences follow the same path from start to finish .",
    "the certification of the sequence produced in section [ sec : homotopy method ] provided by theorem [ th : stepsize ] gives such guarantee .",
    "in certain cases the target solutions obtained by means of uncertified homotopy continuation can be rigourously certified after all of them are obtained .",

    "suppose some procedure provides total degree many approximations to solutions .",
    "if a bound on @xmath355 is known , then using proposition  [ prop : aptproj ] these approximations may be certified as distinct numerical zeros , thus certifying that all solutions have been found .",
    "if no such bound is known , one may still try to prove that the zeros are different by means of smale s @xmath356theorem @xcite ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , these procedures do not detect if path crossing has occurred .",
    "the developed and implemented algorithm provided us with a chance to conduct experiments that illuminated several aspects in the complexity analysis of solving polynomial systems via homotopy continuation .      our experiments in this section",
    "were designed to explore how practical the certified tracking provided by algorithm  [ alg : certified homotopy ] is .",
    "as was already mentioned , the proposed certified procedure makes sense only for a regular homotopy .",
    "moreover , in nearly singular examples the certified homotopy is bound to show bad performance due to steps being minuscule at the end of paths , which is mandated by ( [ eq : lowb ] ) .        for every experiment we provide the number of solutions , the average number of steps per homotopy path both for the certified algorithm ( c ) and one of the best heuristic procedures ( h ) implemented in macaulay2 .",
    "one step in a heuristic algorithm takes more work than that of the certified tracker : there is a predictor and several corrector steps performed and , if unsuccessful , new step size chosen only to repeat the procedure . despite",
    "that the heuristic approach leads to much smaller computational time for larger systems : it could be concluded from the table above that the number of successful heuristic steps does not grow fast with degree of the system and the number of variables ( in comparison to certified tracking ) .        in @xcite ,",
    "a pair @xmath361 was conjectured to be a good starting pair for the linear homotopy .",
    "more exactly , let @xmath362 where the expectation is taken for random @xmath328 .",
    "then , the conjecture in @xcite can be writen as factors as the one here .",

    "we compare the values to that of @xmath369 which according to theorem [ th : complexityhomotopy ] is a bound for the average number of steps .      for each value of @xmath8",
    "we have generated 1000 random systems in @xmath97 with a uniform probability distribution .",
    "the values @xmath371 and @xmath372 are estimated expected value and variance of the number of steps taken by algorithm  [ alg : certified homotopy ] for the initial pair in ( [ equ : conjecture ] ) ; @xmath373 and @xmath374 refer to those for the _ random _ initial pair ; @xmath375 and @xmath376 refer to those for the homogeneous version of the total  degree homotopy system of section [ sec : totaldegree ] containing all the roots of unity ( the choice of the root is irrelevant for symmetry reasons ) .",
    "namely , the pair @xmath377      * the random homotopy seems to take approximately double number of steps than the homotopy with initial pair ( [ equ : conjecture ] ) .",
    "the total degree homotopy lies in - between . *",
    "the average number of steps in the three cases seem to grow as @xmath378 with @xmath379 for @xmath371 , @xmath375 and @xmath373 respectively .",
    "this experiment thus confirms the conjecture by shub and smale and moreover it suggests a more specific form , suggesting that the same bound given for random homotopy should hold for the conjectured pair : @xmath380 with @xmath381 a constant .",
    "we also extend this conjecture to the case of the initial pair total ",
    "degree homotopy pair @xmath382 of equation ( [ eq : totdegreehom ] ) above : @xmath383 moreover , as pointed out above , in the case of degree @xmath384 systems , we obtained experimentally a better bound @xmath385 @xmath381 a constant .",
    "the difference between the experimentally observed value and the theoretical bound in the case of randomly chosen initial pairs , respectively @xmath386 and @xmath387 for @xmath388 can be explained as follows .",
    "the proof of the theoretical bound starts by bounding @xmath389 which follows from the fact that @xmath390 by the geometric interpretation of the condition number .",
    "this last inequality is not sharp in general , and hence one may expect a better behavior of the random linear homotopy method than the one given by the theoretical bound .          1 .   as described in section  [ sec : random ] ; 2 .",
    "the initial pair for the linear homotopy is built by taking @xmath365 in ( [ equ : conjecture ] ) and performing a random unitary coordinate transformation ( see @xcite for a stable and efficient algorithm that chooses such a random unitary matrix ) .",
    "then the following experiment was conjured to show the equiprobability of the roots at the end of a random homotopy promised by theorem  [ th : complexityhomotopy ] : as the target system we take @xmath395 where @xmath243 is as in ( [ equ : conjecture ] ) , @xmath29 is chosen randomly in @xmath97 , and @xmath45 is small . note that @xmath243 has a unique non  singular solution which is very well  conditioned , but it also has a whole subspace of degenerate solutions .",
    "hence , @xmath13 also has a rather well  conditioned solution , and then @xmath396 isolated , but poorly conditioned ones .",
    "one might expect that the random homotopy ( 2 ) we have just described ( for such a fixed @xmath13 ) would be biased to discover the well  conditioned root .",
    "indeed , we obtained numerical evidence that this is not the case : all the solutions seem to be equiprobable .    for @xmath13 with the degrees @xmath397 and @xmath398 and several random choices of @xmath243 we have made experiments with certified tracking procedure making 8000 runs .",
    "we experimented with both variants ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of choosing the random initial pair .",
    "each experiment resulted in close to 1000 hits for each of 8 roots  in both variants ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "this appears to show the conclusion of theorem [ th : complexityhomotopy ] , valid for variant ( 1 ) , and moreover extend it to the case of variant ( 2 ) .",
    "we can state this experimental result in a more precise way , using shannon s entropy as suggested in @xcite .",
    "assume that we have an algorithm that involves some random choice in its input , and that can produce different outputs @xmath399 .",

    "the experimental value of shannon s entropy for the random algorithm in all experiments described above is in the interval @xmath404 $ ] ; the maximum , in this case , is @xmath405 .",
    "the exact reason for the modified algorithm ( variant ( 2 ) ) to produce equiprobability of the roots is not understood .",
