    "high - power laser sources such as er : yag laser at 2.94 @xmath0 m and co@xmath3 laser at 10.6 @xmath0 m have influential medical and technological applications .",
    "the delivery of output intense pulses of these sources in silica - glass step - index fibers has always been a huge obstacle because of the low - damage threshold of the glass materials as well as the high attenuation of silica in the mid - infrared regime .",
    "hollow - core fibers ( hcfs ) , with their unconventional guiding properties , seem to be the best solution for this problem @xcite .",
    "these fibers are engineered waveguides that use non - traditional methods for transferring light over relatively - long distances in a low - index core surrounded by a high - index structure .",
    "photonic bandgap ( pbg ) fibers are periodic microstructures that exploit the analogy with solid - state physics for confining light @xcite .",
    "light with optical frequencies lying within a forbidden bandgap is trapped inside the low - index - core due to the prohibited propagation inside the fiber - cladding .",
    "1d and 2d pbg fibers have been demonstrated by wrapping a multilayered bragg structure @xcite or stacking a number of capillary tubes in a suitably shaped preform @xcite , respectively . by increasing the number of cladding layers ,",
    "the fiber guiding loss is dramatically suppressed , albeit over restricted wavelength bands .    anti - resonant ( ar )",
    "hcf fiber is another type of microstuctured fiber , where the guiding mechanism is based on the anti - resonant modes of fabry prot cavities @xcite .",
    "these fibers have wide transmission windows , but with higher losses in comparison to the pbg fibers . also , adding more layers to the cladding has small influence on decreasing the fiber - losses @xcite . in recent years",
    ", a great deal of effort has been dedicated to suppress dramatically the losses of ar - hcf far beyond that of pbg fibers , by using multi - non - concentric capillary tubes @xcite .",
    "contact points between cladding capillaries have to be avoided , since they would break the antiresonance condition and may lead to additional losses @xcite .",
    "another technique for loss reduction is to add an extra outer cladding with an optimum displacement from the core @xcite .",
    "particular negative curvature cores have been also shown to substantially lessen the fiber - losses @xcite . in this case",
    ", careful design is required to prevent coupling between the core and cladding modes @xcite . very recently",
    ", broadband single - mode operation have been demonstrated in these fibers by resonant filtering of higher order modes @xcite .    , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are the cladding , web , and jacket tube thickness , respectively , @xmath6 is the core - side length , and @xmath7 is the jacket tube radius .",

    "the delivery of the output light emitted by er : yag laser at 2.94 @xmath0 m was achieved by using tube - leaky fibers with losses 0.85 db / m @xcite , or hollow - core negative - curvature fibers with losses 0.06 db / m @xcite . also as recently predicted , transmission losses at this particular wavelength",
    "can reach minimal values using ar fibers with large numbers of nested tubes arranged in a certain order @xcite . in this paper , we present an ar - hcf with a simple design for guiding mid - infra red light at 2.94 @xmath0 m with only @xmath2 db / m losses .",
    "the fiber is made of three identical adjacent silica - glass capillary tubes encircled by a wider capillary with radius @xmath8 acting as a jacket tube with thickness @xmath9 . during the fabrication process",
    "the three touching capillaries create a perfect equilateral triangle ought to the action of surface tension in absence of additional external pressure , as shown in fig .",
    "the triangle has a thickness @xmath10 determined by the dimension of the original capillary , and a length @xmath11 .",
    "the thickness @xmath12 of the supporting webs is constrained by @xmath13 due to fabrication requirements .",
    "it has been shown recently that a core with a polygon shape will have lower guiding losses as the number of the polygon sides decreases @xcite .",
    "hence , one can conjecture that our fiber would have lower losses in comparison to another one with a hexagonal core , for instance .",
    "the fiber is anticipated to have great impact on the delivery of high - power laser pulses @xcite as well as in gas - based nonlinear optical applications @xcite .",
    "the simulations in this paper are done using comsol software for three different fibers with core side lengths @xmath1440 , 70 , 100 @xmath0 m , which we rename so forth as ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "a suitable perfectly matched layer ( pml ) is used to estimate the attenuation of each fiber .",
    "pmls with enough thicknesses , several times the operating wavelength , have been used for the fibers ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "convergence of losses with pml thickness for the three fibers has been achieved as depicted in fig .",
    "for instance , the attenuation of fiber ( c ) is @xmath2 db / m at the designing wavelength 2.94 @xmath0 m .",
    "the error is deduced from the slight oscillations during numerical convergence , observed when increasing the pml layer to large values .",
    "material absorption losses have not been included similar to recent studies @xcite . a capillary tube that has the thickness of the triangle ( c ) and the radius of its inscribed circle has losses 26.86 db / m , which demonstrates the effectiveness of our design .",

    "[ fig2 ] , we have chosen the 1@xmath30order anti - resonance with @xmath31 2.19 @xmath0 m thickness , since it results in transmission losses @xmath32 db / m for fiber ( c ) .    the effect of the jacket tube thickness on the losses for the three fibers has been portrayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] with @xmath33 2.19 @xmath17 m .",
    "first , as the core - side increases , the core effective area also increases , and the loss will drop due to better mode accommodation inside the large core .",
    "in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , the losses in our fiber have a periodic oscillatory dependence as @xmath9 varies .",
    "the loss minima occurs when the jacket tube thickness also satisfies the anti - resonant condition eq .",
    "moreover , the loss peaks are positioned at 1.46 , 2.91 , and 4.37 @xmath0 m , which are exactly the thicknesses that fullfil the resonant condition eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] for @xmath34 .",
    "although light is trapped inside the triangular - core , satisfying this resonance condition in the jacket - tube ring allows the confined mode to escape from the core towards the jacket through the fiber webs .    , with @xmath33 2.19 @xmath17 m and @xmath16 2.94 @xmath17 m .",
    "straight blue , dashed - dotted red , and dashed green lines represent the fibers ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) with side lengths @xmath14 40 , 70 , and 100 @xmath0m.[fig3],width=325 ]    our fiber performance measured by the spectral - dependence of its losses and dispersion is displayed in panels ( i , ii ) of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for the three fibers under consideration with @xmath35 2.19 @xmath15 m .",
    "the loss - dependence behaves similarly to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , however , with slightly decreasing losses as moving towards shorter wavelengths .",
    "the reason is that the modal effective area shrinks when decreasing the wavelength , hence , the mode is better confined and its guiding - loss drops .",
    "the loss maxima and minima take place when the wavelength matches eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , respectively . for the fiber ( c ) , with side - length 100 @xmath0 m , the attenuation approaches notably only @xmath36 db / m at the designing wavelength 2.94 @xmath0 m , very close to that value obtained using the negative curvature fiber @xcite . as demonstrated in panel ( ii ) , the fiber exhibits also flat low dispersion of about 2.3 ps / km / nm around this wavelength , especially for the case ( c ) , allowing the fiber to be of great interest for nonlinear light - matter applications , especially when the core is filled with gases .     2.94 @xmath37 m , and @xmath35 2.19 @xmath15 m .

    "( d ) , we have compared the triangular fiber ( c ) to a hexagonal fiber that has the criterion of having the same incircle enclosed by the triangle - core as well as the same jacket tube radius @xmath7 .",
    "we have found that the losses of the hexagonal fiber is 156 db / m , which is much higher than the triangular - core fiber , as we have anticipated earlier .",

    "the values of the effective areas of each mode are enclosed in the panels.[fig6],width=325 ]    we have also explored the possibility of implementing negative - curvature cores that can reduce the confinement loss more @xcite . in designing this type of fiber ,",
    "we maintain the locations of the three vertices as in the straight case via choosing a radius of curvature @xmath40 larger than the side of the triangle , @xmath41 . using this method ,",
    "the bent walls are prevented from touching each other , avoiding the formation of optical resonators that may lead to additional losses . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we have scanned the radius of curvature @xmath42 from 150 to 500 @xmath15 m , and have calculated the losses . in this simulation , the determined values of the triangular - core and jacket thicknesses from the above studies have been used .",
    "surprisingly , the losses of our fiber do not behave traditionally by varying the radius of curvature . for large values of @xmath42 ,",
    "which in the limit @xmath43 would correspond to the straight wall case , the losses approach asymptotically the aforementioned values 0.08 db / m . with decreasing @xmath42 or in other words increasing curvature",
    ", losses start to have strong peaks around @xmath44 160 and 320 @xmath15 m due to large coupling overlap between the core and cladding modes @xcite .",
    "the minimum between these two peaks is approximately @xmath45 0.2 db / m , which indicates that negative curvature does not assist in suppressing the guiding losses .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed the design of a new simple anti - resonant triangular - core fiber that can guide light at the mid - infrared frequency range .",
    "the fiber is made of relatively few identical capillary tubes with thickness 2.19 @xmath0 m .",
    "our fiber has shown remarkably low - loss below 0.1 db / m as well as low dispersion @xmath46 ps / km / nm at the operating wavelength 2.94 @xmath37 m .",
    "also , we have shown that the thickness of the jacket tube has a significant role in confining the light inside the core .",
    "moreover , we found that introducing negatively curved walls does not work towards loss - suppression .",
    "in fact , much higher losses have been obtained for certain values of the radius of curvature due to strong overlap between the modes of the core and the cladding . finally , we believe that our design will induce other novel ideas and stimulate new research in the area of guiding far - infrared light .     with fixed distance 100 @xmath15 m between its vertices .",
