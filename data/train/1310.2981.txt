    "vafa @xcite proposed a conjectural description of deep relationship between reformulated invariants of colored homfly - pt link in late 1990s and early 2000s .",

    "in some sense the labastida - mario - ooguri - vafa ( lmov ) conjecture can be expressed purely by using mathematical language , i.e. irreducible representation of quantum groups .",
    "the physics background of this conjecture can be dated back to t hooft s seminal work on large @xmath5 expansion of @xmath6 gauge field theories in 1974 .",
    "gopakumar and vafa @xcite described the exact theory that closed topological string theory on the resolved conifold is dual to the @xmath6 chern - simons theory on @xmath7 .",
    "the gromov - witten theory of the resolved conifold actually corresponds to the chern - simons theory of an unknot .",
    "the lmov conjecture considers the more general case when the link or knot is nontrivial and the corresponding wilson loop expectation values , i.e. colored homfly - pt polynomial of the link .",
    "so the lmov conjecture could be viewed as a counterpart of gopakumar - vafa conjecture .",
    "previously people thought that only homfly - pt can be expressed as a series in @xmath8 and @xmath9 with integer coefficients ; while the colored homfly - pt polynomial is just a polynomial of @xmath10 and @xmath11 with rational coefficients .",
    "the lmov conjecture predicts an intrinsic symmetry of @xmath12 about reformulated invariants of the colored homfly - pt polynomial and hidden integrality encoded in the colored homfly - pt polynomial .    in the late 2010s ,",
    "the orthogonal lmov conjecture was also formulated by lin chen & qingtao chen @xcite . and marcos mario @xcite .",
    "chen - chen s formulation put an emphasis on the colored kauffman solely ; while mario s put an emphasis on the relation between the colored homfly - pt polynomials and the colored kauffman polynomials .",
    "more recently , kefeng liu and pan peng @xcite obtained a new structure of the colored homfly - pt polynomial that the chern - simons partition function appeared in the lmov conjecture can be expressed as an infinite product , which indicates some potential modularity of the chern - simons partition function @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "an infinite product expression for the orthogonal chern - simons partition function appeared in the orthogonal lmov type conjecture is established and the case of unknot is presented in explicit formula .",
