    "damped ly@xmath0 ( dla ) absorbers in quasar spectra are the class of absorbers with the highest column density of neutral hydrogen ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "they are important as it can be shown that they contain the bulk of the neutral hydrogen content of the universe ( e.g.  storrie - lombardi & wolfe 2000 ) .",
    "the similarity of the column densities of dlas to those through the disks of spiral galaxies have lead some authors to consider them as the direct progenitors of present - day spirals ( e.g.  prochaska & wolfe 1998 ) .",
    "however , dwarf galaxies and low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbgs ) also can have similar columns ( boissier , peroux & pettini 2003 ) , and metallicity arguments support dwarf galaxies ( pettini et al .",
    "theorists have interpreted them in the context of hierarchical galaxy formation models as sub - units which will eventually merge to form @xmath1 galaxies today ( haehnelt , steinmetz & rauch 1998 ; maller et al .  2001 ) or as dwarf galaxies in which star formation is supressed by supernova feedback ( efstathiou 2000 ) .",
    "the reason for the proliferation of theories for the nature of dlas is that reliably identifying the galaxies responsible for the absorption , even at @xmath3 , has proven to be very difficult .",
    "imaging studies of @xmath3 absorbers , e.g.  le brun et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ; rao et al .",
    "( 2002 ) indicate that a range of galaxy types might be responsible for producing dlas , but few candidate dlas have measured redshifts , so reliable constraints on the nature of the dla population remain poor .",
    "paradoxically , mgii absorbers , with much lower column densities on average , have been easier to identify .",
    "they seem to be sampling the normal galaxy population , with a mean luminosity of @xmath4 at @xmath5 ( steidel , dickinson & persson 1994 ; steidel et al .",
    "possible reasons for the difficulty of identifying the galaxies causing dla systems include small impact parameters , low stellar luminosities or low surface brightnesses .",
    "so far only six @xmath3 dlas have been spectroscopically - confirmed ( and all of these are at @xmath6 ) .",
    "several are dwarf or low surface brightness galaxies , the best - studied example of which is sbs  1543 + 5921 ( bowen , tripp & jenkins 2001 ) , but the dla absorber of ao  0827 + 24 is a fairly normal , luminous spiral ( steidel et al.2002 ) .",
    "many more suggested identifications have been made on the basis of proximity to the quasar and consistent photometry , but the reliability of these is unclear .",
    "dlas are easy to identify in the spectra of high redshift ( @xmath7 ) quasars as they show up clearly in observed optical spectra , but they are hard to identify at lower redshift . by adopting the strategy of taking uv spectra with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( @xmath8 ) of the highest rest - frame equivalent width ( @xmath9 ) mgii absorbers in the literature , rao & turnshek ( 2001 ) were able to identify a sample of lower redshift ( @xmath10 ) dlas ( see also boisse & bergeron  1998 ) .",
    "high @xmath9 mgii absorbers also typically show high @xmath9 feii absorption lines , and these have been hypothesised to be better tracers of cool gas than mgii ( bergeron & stasiska 1986 ) .",
    "we have therefore used the first bright quasar survey ( fbqs ; white et al .",
    "2000 ; becker et al .  2001 ) to select a similar sample with @xmath9 ( feii 2600)@xmath11 .",
    "we have taken spectra of 26 of the sample with stis on the _ hst _ to look for dla systems .",
    "we have followed up this sample using the keck telescope , taking near - infrared images in sub - arcsecond seeing , medium - resolution spectra of the quasars , and low - resolution spectra of the candidate absorbers .",
    "we are mid - way through spectroscopic follow - up of the fbqs sample , and have identified four galaxies with redshifts the same as that of the feii absorbers . of these four , however , only two are associated with absorbers which are definitely damped .",

    "the @xmath32-corrections have been derived using a model 5gyr old sd galaxy from the pegase library ( rocca - volmerange & fioc 1997 ) .",
    "we picked this model as representative of a moderately young , star - forming galaxy , a decision motivated by the discovery of [ oii ] emission from the candidate dla galaxies .",
    "fbqs  0051 + 0041 was imaged with the echellette spectrograph and imager ( esi ) on keck - ii and fbqs  1137 + 3907 with the near - infrared camera ( nirc ) on keck - i .",
    "details of the observations are given in in table 1 .",
    "a sequence of short ( 3 - 5min ) dithered exposures of each object were taken .",
    "after dark subtraction and flat - fielding with dome flats the data were analysed using dimsum and xdimsum in iraf , respectively .",
    "the dimsum package performs two passes on the data . in the first pass ,",
    "a background image is made from a median of the dithered frames and the data are combined with integer pixel shifts to make masks which are used to mask out objects when constructing an improved sky background image for the second pass . in the second pass , the improved background is subtracted from the images before they are shifted and coadded , and a magnification factor may be applied to the data .",
    "the pixel scale of the esi image was sufficiently small compared to the seeing that no magnification was used in the second pass for fbqs  0051 + 0041 .",
    "the operation of the dimsum package is explained in more detail in stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson ( 1995 ) .",
    "the xdimsum package is a modification of dimsum by l.  davis at noao . amongst other improvements it runs significantly faster and allows non - integer magnification factors in the second pass .",
    "we used a factor of 2.3 for the fbqs  1137 + 3907 image .",
    "photometry for fbqs  0051 + 0041 was obtained using observations of the landolt ( 1992 ) standard 107 - 215 , and that for fbqs  1137 + 3907 from observations of the standard star p266-c from persson et al .",
    "both quasar fields were imaged in photometric conditions .",
    "the @xmath33 limiting magnitudes in 2-arcsec diameter apertures are @xmath34 for the fbqs  0051 + 0041 field and @xmath35 for the fbqs  1137 + 3907 field .",
    "we performed approximate subtractions of the quasars using point spread functions derived from either from a star in the same image ( fbqs  0051 + 0041 ) or from other quasars observed on the same night ( fbqs  1137 + 3907 ) .",
    "the psf was fitted with a least - squares fit using code developed for fitting quasar host galaxies ( lacy et al .  2002 ) .",
    "the particular algorithm employed here subtracted the psf such that the mean value within a radius @xmath36 from the center of the quasar was set to zero .",
    "the values of @xmath36 used were 06 for fbqs  0051 + 0041 and 03 for fbqs  1137 + 3907 .",
    "neither psf subtraction was very satisfactory , as we made no serious attempt to obtain good , unsaturated psfs for the quasars .",
    "they have successfully removed the wings of the psfs , however .",
    "the resulting images are shown in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the quasars were observed with the stis with the mama detectors and the g230l grating as part of program 9051 .",
    "the 02 slit was used , giving a spectral resolving power of 330 at the redshifted wavelength of ly@xmath0 , corresponding to a velocity resolution of @xmath37 .",
    "each quasar was observed for two 1100s exposures , the second exposure being dithered @xmath38 along the slit .",
    "the uv spectrum of fbqs  1137 + 3907 shows it to be a high - ionization broad - absorption line ( bal ) quasar , with a bal trough blueshifted by @xmath39 .",
    "fortunately , the lyman-@xmath0 absorption line is clear of the bal troughs , falling just to the red of the ovi trough in the quasar spectrum .",
    "the spectra are shown in figures 3 and 4 .    a detailed discussion of the hst spectra and measurements of the damped absorbers are provided in a companion paper ( storrie - lombardi , et .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "the column densities of the damped absorbers were initially estimated from measurements of the equivalent widths of the absorption lines with the redshift determined from the low ionization metal lines from our ground - based spectra .",
    "profiles were then fit iteratively to determine the best fit column density and redshift for hi absorption feature .",
    "the column densities should be accurate to @xmath40 and the redshifts to @xmath41 . though higher resolution spectra covering multiple lines in the lyman series would be ideal for this purpose , the substantial hst time that would be involved in obtaining them makes such observations impractical for large samples of objects . at higher redshifts ,",
    "we have shown via observation and simulation that moderate resolution spectra provide an excellent estimate for the measured hi column densities ( e.g. storrie - lombardi et .",
    "al . 1996 ; storrie - lombardi & wolfe 2000 ) , which gives us high confidence that the features in these spectra are damped and are not blends of lower column density lines .",
    "the candidate absorbers were observed with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ) on keck - i using the 300 line mm@xmath42 , 5000@xmath43blaze grating in the red arm and a 1-arcsecond slit ( see table 2 ) .",
    "this combination results in a spectral resolving power of @xmath44 , corresponding to a velocity resolution of @xmath45 .",
    "the wavelength range covered was from @xmath46 .",
    "in addition , observations of the quasars were made with esi on keck - ii to obtain medium - resolution spectra of the absorption lines .",
    "the feii 2586 and 2600@xmath43lines fell in a noisy region near an order overlap in the esi spectra , but the mgii 2796 and 2803@xmath43lines were detected at high signal - to - noise in both quasars .",
    "fbqs 0051 + 0041 was observed with esi on 2000 december 31 with a @xmath47 slit , and fbqs 1137 + 3907 on 2001 march 20 with a @xmath48 slit , yielding resolving powers of 5400 and 4100 respectively .",
    "the esi spectra of the quasars in the region around mgii are shown in figures 5 and 6 , and the lris spectra of the galaxies at the absorber redshifts in figures 7 and 8 .",
    "the _ hst _ spectrum shows that this absorber is a borderline dla , with a column density just above the division between lyman - limit and dla systems ( table 3 ) .",
    "similarly , the @xmath9 of the feii absorption only just satisfies our selection criteria .",
    "the candidate absorber galaxy , galaxy ` a ' in figure 1 , seems , at first sight , to be a fairly normal , star forming galaxy , offset by 24kpc from the quasar ( figures 1 and 7 ) .",
    "the spectrum , however , shows a small mis - match between the [ oii]3727 redshift of 0.740 and the absorption line redshift from the ca ii h+k lines ( 0.738 ) , though the signal - to - noise ratio of the absorption lines is low .",
    "two distinct velocity components are also seen in the low - ionization mgii , mgi and feii quasar absorption lines in our esi spectrum , one at @xmath49 and one at @xmath50 ( i.e.  a @xmath51 velocity difference ) .",
    "whether these two components correspond to two galaxies , the candidate and a dwarf companion nearer the quasar , or reflect internal gas motions in the candidate absorber is unclear .",
    "this is a much higher column density absorber than that of fbqs  0051 + 0041 .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "spectrum shows several strong uv metal absorption lines in addition to the damped ly@xmath0 line ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the lris slit was placed to cover both candidate absorbing galaxies , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and line emission is seen from both of them ( barely resolved from each other ) at the wavelength corresponding to [ oii ] 3727 at @xmath54 ( figure 9 ) .",
    "there is also a marginal detection of h@xmath55 at the same redshift ( figure 8) .",
    "although we see no other features from @xmath52 or @xmath53 , it seems unlikely that the strong emission line can be anything other than [ oii ] at the absorber redshift , given its high equivalent width and the lack of lines nearby in the spectrum .",
    "we also took a spectrum with the slit aligned with object ` b ' .",
    "this showed that ` b ' had blue optical continuum emission , but no strong features from which to obtain a redshift . as it is further from the quasar than ` c ' and has no features at wavelengths corresponding to the absorption redshift",

    "the two deepest features , visible in all the lines , are at @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( i.e.  a @xmath51 velocity difference ) .",
    "thus the [ oii ] emission is most likely to be associated with the deeper , less redshifted absorption component .",
    "the dla absorber candidate close to fbqs 0051 + 0041 has a luminosity of approximately @xmath1 , whereas that associated with fbqs 1137 + 3907 is about @xmath99 .",
    "the galaxy types are unclear .",
    "both are apparently forming stars , possessing both blue continua and [ oii ] emission lines , and the complicated velocity structures of the mgii absorption lines seen in the esi spectra , might be indicative of starburst - induced winds ( e.g.  ellison et al .",
    "further evidence for this is the offset between the emission and absorption redshifts in fbqs 0051 + 0041a , if real .",
    "thus there is some evidence that both may be starburst galaxies .",
    "however , the continuum slope of fbqs 0051 + 0041a is a little too red unless the starburst is reddened by dust , and fbqs 1137 + 3907c has a high axial ratio , suggesting a spiral rather than an irregular galaxy ( though the shape of ` c ' may also be due to it being composed of a chain of knots ) .",
    "higher spatial resolution multicolor imaging will be required to determine the nature of these galaxies .",
    "table 4 summarizes the properties of the eight known candidate dla galaxies at @xmath3 which spectroscopy has shown to lie at the absorber redshift .",
    "selection effects will mean that the absorber population for which spectroscopic identification is possible will be biased .",
    "observational requirements for successful spectroscopy , namely an impact parameter @xmath100 arcsec and an apparent magnitude brighter than @xmath101 , will naturally favor massive galaxies . for our fbqs sample discussed in the introduction , and",
    "from which fbqs 0051 + 0041 and fbqs 1137 + 3907 were drawn , we have so far only successfully identified candidates and obtained spectra with redshifts consistent with those of the absorber system for four out of thirteen of our high @xmath9 absorption systems .",
    "in addition , there is another subtle selection effect from the way most ( though not all ) of the dlas in table 4 have been selected , namely on the basis of high @xmath9 metal absorption lines .",
    "this will tend to bias the sample towards higher metallicity , more massive , galaxies .",
    "working against these two effects is the possibility that many of the more massive dla galaxies are dusty enough to significantly extinguish the light from the background quasar , and cause the quasar to drop out of optically - selected samples .",
    "this may tend to produce a bias towards relatively dust - free , less massive hosts , and may explain why the mgii absorbers , with their generally higher impact parameters and lower hi column densities , are observed to have luminosities around @xmath25 . however , the results of the survey of radio - loud quasars of ellison et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggest that this is not an important effect .",
    "any such effect will also be much reduced for fbqs quasars as they are selected on the palomar @xmath102-plates with a relatively red ( @xmath103 ) color selection criterion .",
    "thus , despite most of the selection effects favouring successful spectroscopic identification of the most luminous absorbing dla galaxies , it is clear from table 4 that many are sub-@xmath1 , and this suggests that the majority of the dla population is probably sub-@xmath1 .",
    "both our dla candidates appear to be actively forming stars , consistent with them being relatively gas - rich galaxies .",
    "a large fraction of the known spectroscopically - confirmed dla systems at low redshift listed in table 4 appear to be merging or interacting in some way , for example , fbqs  1137 + 3907c , pks  1127 - 145 and pks  1243 - 072  a ( though obviously the statistics are poor at present , and few apparent pairs have been spectroscopically confirmed ) .",

    "<S> we have identified galaxies near two quasars which are at the redshift of damped lyman-@xmath0 ( dla ) systems in the uv spectra of the quasars . </S>",
    "<S> both galaxies are actively forming stars . </S>",
    "<S> one galaxy has a luminosity close to the break in the local galaxy luminosity function , @xmath1 , the other is significantly fainter than @xmath1 and appears to be interacting with a nearby companion . despite the strong selection effects favoring spectroscopic identification of the most luminous dla galaxies , many of the spectroscopically - identified dla galaxies in the literature are sub-@xmath1 , suggesting that the majority of the dla population is probably sub-@xmath1 , in contrast to mgii absorbers at similar redshifts whose mean luminosity is close to @xmath1 . </S>"
