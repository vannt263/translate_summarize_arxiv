    "this degeneracy will be lifted at a transition where the local symmetry is lowered and long range orbital order occurs in the low temperature - phase@xcite .",
    "the local orbital order will be accompanied by local structure distortions because of a linear coupling between the occupations of the different orbital states and the lattice@xcite .",
    "this is the jt effect . in a perovskite structure",
    "this is a distortion and rotation of the oxygen octahedra where in the lattice structure abo@xmath0 ( where a= rare - earth cation and b = mn ) the b atom is octahedrally coordinated to the oxygen .",
    "the local distortion around one b ion affects other ions in the crystal because the oxygen ions are shared between two octahedra .",
    "if a large fraction of the energy of the orbital ordering comes from the energy lowering due to the interaction with the lattice the interaction is known as a cooperative jt effect@xcite .",
    "there is a linear coupling between an @xmath2 orbital and the e distortion modes of the octahedron .",
    "the coupling may be determined from a classical harmonic approximation to the lattice dynamics@xcite .",
    "the subject has attracted much interest recently because of the interplay between the magnetism and the lattice .",
    "the coulomb repulsion alone which gives rise to magnetic superexchange@xcite can also drive orbital order and hence there has been much efforts to determine the relative importance of the lattice effects , cooperative jt , and the electronic energies in driving the transition .",

    "evidence has also been presented@xcite for orbital ordering in lamno@xmath0 which is based on the splitting of the mn 4p levels by the mn 3d orbital ordering .",
    "lamno@xmath0 undergoes a structural phase transition@xcite at the jt temperature , @xmath17 @xmath19 .",

    "snchez _ et al_.@xcite showed by means of x - ray absorption near edge structure and extended x - ray absorption fine structure at the mn @xmath25-edge that the structural transition originates by the ordering of tetragonally distorted octahedra and they analysed the entropy content of the transition within the framework of the three - state potts model@xcite with nearest - neighbour antiferrodistortive coupling .",
    "it is confirmed@xcite , by using neutron diffraction data and a combined rietveld and high real space resolution atomic pair distribution function analysis , that the nature of the jt transition around @xmath17 is to be orbital order - disorder and the intermediate structure suggests the presence of local ordered clusters implying strong nearest - neighbour jt antidistortive coupling .",
    "millis@xcite derived a classical model , which was based on previous work by kanamori@xcite , for the lattice distortions in manganites .",
    "the model may be approximated either by an antiferromagnetic @xmath26 model with a modest threefold anisotropy or by a 3-state potts model with an antiferromagnetic first - neighbour interaction and a weak second - neighbour interaction .",
    "this differs from our model which deals only with the nearest neighbour interaction .",
    "we study the orbital ordering appropriate for lamno@xmath0 obtained from our model and the jt distortion which occurs above jt temperature in that phase .",
    "the model proposed here for the disordered phase is an array of localised distortions with no long range order .",
    "this differs from the model of zhou - goodenough@xcite who postulated that dynamic jt effects occur in the high temperature phase .",
    "zhou and goodenough suggested that the orbital order - disorder transition at @xmath17 is to a dynamic jt stabilisation at the @xmath2 electrons persisting into the high - temperature o - orthorhombic phase , and they proposed a vibronic mechanism to explain the electrical resistivity and thermoelectric power above and below @xmath17 respectively .",
    "it is well known that the phenomenological models such as pseudo spin or potts models are very useful to study order - disorder transitions . in the lamno@xmath0 system ,",
    "the mno@xmath18 octahedra are not independent as they share oxygen atoms with their nearest neighbours .",
    "the standard 3-state potts model alone does not have the correct orbital ordering for lamno@xmath0 as a possible ground state . in this paper",
    ", we describe a phenomenological model that gives the correct ground state for the orbital ordering and a good value for high-@xmath27 entropy for the lamno@xmath0 phase .",
    "the model is called the anisotropic potts model and has been presented earlier@xcite .    in section [ methodology ] , the anisotropic potts model and its phase diagram are presented and its application to lamno@xmath0 is in section [ lmo ] . the model is used to give understanding of the orbital ordering just above @xmath17 in section [ j2=0 ] .",
    "finally , we conclude the results in the last section .",
    "we model the transition at @xmath17 considering only the largest distortions that leave the crystal tetragonal in the low temperature phase .",
    "if the tetragonal axis is chosen along @xmath28 direction the orbital ordering is characterised by the vector @xmath29 .",

    "similarly , using @xmath42 gives a state , @xmath43 , which has its main lobe along @xmath44 direction .",
    "we use the jt states in our phenomenological model because these allow us to use the same states below @xmath17 for any of the three possible @xmath45 vectors , ( 110 ) , ( 101 ) and ( 011 ) , and also above @xmath17 .",
    "the model presents the correct dimension of the order parameter .",
    "there are six equivalent orderings that can occur .",
    "these correspond to the three choices for the tetragonal axis and , then , the phase ( @xmath46 ) of the order parameter . in the high temperature phase of the potts model the orbits are in one of states @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",
    "this differs from zhou and goodenough@xcite who assumed that above @xmath17 the orbit is rotating , thus , all values of @xmath49 are accessed dynamically . because the orbital ordering in the transition metal oxides has three anisotropic states it is natural to set up a three states potts model .",
    "the standard @xmath50-state potts model@xcite consists of a lattice of spins , which can take @xmath50 different values from 1 to @xmath50 , and whose hamiltonian is @xmath51 where @xmath52 ..... is one of the @xmath50 states on site @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the kronecker function which is equal to 1 when the states on sites @xmath53 and @xmath55 are identical , @xmath56 , and is zero otherwise , @xmath57 means that the sum is over the nearest neighbour pairs , @xmath58 is the exchange integral and @xmath59 is the total number of sites in the lattice . for @xmath60 ,",
    "this is equivalent to the ising model .",

    "this phase had an entropy at low temperature that was higher than that obtained for lamno@xmath0 phase above @xmath17 .",
    "we obtained the order parameter of the orbital ordering phases as a function of temperature in good agreement with the published results .",
    "the square of the order parameter , @xmath145 , of the orbital ordering decreases faster for @xmath182 than an ising model . at @xmath17",
    "it goes to zero discontinuously in a first order transition .    the ratio of @xmath72 /@xmath71 necessary to give the lamno@xmath0 ground state are @xmath183 and within this range we find that the results are almost independent of the exact value of @xmath72 /@xmath184 . in particular we find similar shapes of the curve @xmath141 as a function of the reduced temperature , @xmath185@xmath17 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ op ] and also that entropy above @xmath17 as shown in fig .",
    "[ sph ] is also approximately constant .",
    "furthermore , the range of values of @xmath72 /@xmath184 required to give the observed ordering temperature is consistent with those proposed from a microscopic model .",
    "thus we have shown that the temperature dependence of the orbital ordering in lamno@xmath0 is represented well by a phenomenological three state potts model .",
