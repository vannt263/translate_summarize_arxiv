    "a recent experiment @xcite on a film of turbulent liquid crystal realized the growth of a droplet made up of a stable phase and expanding into a metastable phase .",
    "the shape fluctuations of the droplet were measured with high precision . in approximation the top part of this droplet can be represented by a height function @xmath0 , @xmath1 on the real line , and its dynamics is governed the one - dimensional version of the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the first term on the right hand side is a non - linearity which results from growth normal to the interface at leading order in the local slope .",
    "the second term is the surface tension which tends to smoothen the interface .",
    "the last term describes the random nucleation events at the interface and is modeled by a gaussian white noise @xmath3 with covariance @xmath4 by scale invariance of the kpz equation one can switch to dimensionless variables .",
    "we make the choice @xmath5 the conversion to a general set of coefficients is discussed in @xcite , for example .",
    "we will consider the case of sharp wedge initial conditions , @xmath6 the solution to ( [ kpz ] )  ( [ kpz t=0 ] ) is written as @xmath7 } h(x , t ) = -\\frac{t}{24 } - \\frac{x^2}{2 t } + \\big(\\frac{t}{2}\\big)^{1/3}\\xi(x , t)\\,.\\ ] ] the flattening parabola should be viewed as the top part of the droplet in the experiment of @xcite and @xmath8 are the superimposed fluctuations .",
    "of course , the kpz equation holds in greater generality , in particular also for interface motion and growth models in higher dimensions . for surveys on the earlier developments we refer to @xcite .",
    "recently the kpz equation has been used as a challenging test ground for nonequilibrium rg techniques @xcite .",
    "the subtraction @xmath9 is uniquely fixed by the requirement that @xmath10 is independent of @xmath1 for given @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , by the scale invariance of the kpz equation , for fixed @xmath12 also higher order correlations depend only on the relative distance in @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath10 depends on @xmath12 . to determine its value is less obvious , since the construction of the solution to ( [ kpz ] )  ( [ kpz t=0 ] ) already requires a diverging uniform shift in the @xmath13-direction",
    "this is most easily explained for the initial condition @xmath14 .",
    "the construction of the solution requires @xmath15 which means that @xmath16 with @xmath17 diverging as @xmath18 .",
    "our convention here is to fix the first exponential moment of the solution to ( [ kpz ] )  ( [ kpz t=0 ] ) as @xmath19 therefore @xmath20 the rationale behind introducing the scale @xmath21 for @xmath8 and subtracting @xmath22 results from the kpz scaling theory which asserts that @xmath23 for large @xmath12 with @xmath24 the true asymptotic velocity .",
    "@xmath24 is non - universal , @xmath25 in our case and our units .",
    "the numerical factor @xmath26 will be discussed below .    as in the experiment @xcite , the quantity of prime physical interest is the fluctuating amplitude @xmath8 at fixed @xmath27 .",
    "by stationarity one may pick @xmath28 and we define @xmath29 to determine numerically the statistics of @xmath30 is extremely demanding and has never been accomplished , see @xcite for the best results available .",

    "the numerical task is demanding , since it concerns the computation of the fredholm determinants , as will be explained in section 2 . for the data plot",
    "it is natural to distinguish short time , see section 3 , and long time behavior , see section 4 .",
    "to plot the distribution @xmath46 , one needs to evaluate the @xmath12-dependent family of functions @xmath47 , see ( [ gt ] ) .",
    "efficient , to some extent even optimal techniques to numerically compute fredholm determinants have been developed recently @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to employ a properly adapted discretization of the integrals appearing in the definition ( [ def fredholm det ] ) of the fredholm determinant .    as an example , let us first consider the case of a kernel @xmath48 with support in @xmath49 ^ 2 $ ] , so that all the integrals in ( [ def fredholm det ] ) range from @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
