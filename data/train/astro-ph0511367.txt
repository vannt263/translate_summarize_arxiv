    "cataclysmic variable stars are very close binary star systems consisting of a compact stellar remnant _ primary _ star  typically a white dwarf star  which is stripping mass from a less - massive lower - main - sequence _ secondary _ star ( hellier 2001 , warner 1995 ) .",
    "they are closely related to the low - mass x - ray binaries , which instead have neutron star or black hole primaries .",
    "cataclysmic variables display a wide range of behavior , the most dramatic being the _ classical nova _ explosion which occurs when the accreted surface hydrogen layer is massive enough to ignite a thermonuclear runaway in the envelope layers of the primary white dwarf star , causing the system to brighten by a factor of @xmath0@xmath1 to @xmath2 over the pre - eruption brightness .",
    "less dramatic but far more common are the photometric variations caused by the accretion disk itself , which is typically the brightest component of the system . simple energy arguments ( frank , king , & raine 1992 ) show that the total accretion disk luminosity is approximately @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the white dwarf mass and radius , respectively , @xmath6 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath7 is the accretion rate onto @xmath4 . roughly speaking ,",
    "half the luminosity should be radiated in the disk , and half in the boundary layer where the keplerian accretion flow settles onto the more - slowly rotating white dwarf .",
    "viscosity within the differentially - rotating fluid of the disk acts to transport angular momentum outward in radius , so that mass can migrate inward .",
    "angular momentum from the outer disk is fed back into the orbital angular momentum of the secondary star via tidal torques .",
    "the material in the accretion stream is highly supersonic when it impacts the edge of the disk , causing a _ bright spot _ which when observed in high inclination ( i.e. , more nearly edge - on ) systems leads to an observed brightening for that portion of the orbit that the bright spot is facing the observer .",
    "this brightening once per orbit is called an _ orbital hump _ , and if present reveals the orbital period .",
    "systems with high mass transfer rates @xmath8 , where @xmath9 indicates units of solar masses , are classified as old - novae or novalikes , depending on if a classical nova explosion has been observed or not .",
    "the disks in these systems are thought to be in a permanent high - viscosity state , such that mass transfer through the disk and onto @xmath4 is efficient and in a state of quasi - equilibrium .",
    "most systems with smaller mass transfer rates @xmath10 are so - called dwarf nova systems , and have disks that cycle between high and low states .",
    "the mass flow through @xmath11 is not sufficient to keep the disk permanently in high state , so matter accumulates in the disk until a critical point is reached . before this critical point",
    "is reached , the mass flow rate onto @xmath4 is low , and hence so is the system luminosity .",
    "once reached , however , a heating wave propagates through the disk material , sharply increasing the viscosity and mass flow through the disk and onto the white dwarf , resulting in a rapid brightening of the system by a factor of @xmath0@xmath12 in what is called a _ dwarf nova outburst_. the source of accretion disk viscosity is thought to be the magnetorotational instability ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) .",
    "in addition to normal dwarf nova outbursts , many systems with short orbital periods ( @xmath13 h ) are observed to display _ superoutbursts _ , which are roughly twice as bright and last some 5 times longer ( patterson et al . 2005 ) than normal dwarf nova outbursts . in all superoutbursting systems , photometric oscillations with a period a few percent longer than the orbital period",
    "are observed to grow to detectability on a timescale of a few tens of orbits . because they are associated with superoutbursts , these periodic signals are known as _",
    "superhumps_. we now understand that superhumps are the result of a driven oscillation of the disk by the rotating tidal field of the secondary star ( whitehurst 1988 ; hirose & osaki 1990 ; lubow 1991 ; simpson & wood 1998 ) . for systems with mass ratios @xmath14 ,",
    "the disk can extend out to the region of the 3:1 co - rotation radius , and the inner lindblad resonance can be excited ( lubow 1991 ) .",
    "cataclysmic variables have long been a favorite target of amateur and professional astronomers and anyone with a modest - aperture telescope and a ccd camera can obtain useful data on brighter objects .",
    "for example , the _ center for backyard astrophysics _ is a global network of ( mostly amature ) astronomers with small telescopes dedicated to the study of cataclysmic variables ( cba.phys.columbia.edu ) , and the _ american association of variable star observers _ ( aavso ) , founded in 1911 at harvard college observatory to coordinate variable star observations made largely by amateur astronomers , has a large contingent interested in cvs specifically ( aavso.org ) .",
    "our group has been studying the superhump phenomenon numerically using the method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) .",
    "the experiments have confirmed the physical origin of the observed superhump lightcurves ( simpson & wood 1998 , wood , montgomery , & simpson 2000 ) , and shown that the light curves should become harmonically more complex for disks observed more nearly edge - on ( simpson , wood , & burke 1998 ) .",
    "our research code computes the hydrodynamics of accretion disks in three dimensions , and is highly optimized for serial computers , running as a command - line fortran program under the linux operating system .",
    "because of the high level of interest among observers in cvs and the difficulty in visualizing accretion disk dynamics from artist conceptions and text descriptions in journals , we decided to develop and release a demonstration version of fitdisk  that includes a graphical user interface ( gui ) and which runs under the windowsxp operating system .    in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly introduce the method of sph as applied to cataclysmic variable accretion disks . in section 3",
    "we discuss the porting of fitdisk  to the windowsxp environment and how to use the program .",
    "we show how our simulation light curves compare with time - series observations of the helium dwarf nova cr boo in section 4 .",
    "conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "the method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) approximates continuum hydrodynamics using a scattered grid , where the grid points are effectively lagrangian point markers in the fluid ( lucy 1977 , monaghan 1992 , 2005 ) .",
    "it is a powerful technique for simulating physical systems that are highly dynamic and bounded by vacuum ; thus , for many astrophysical systems , sph can be a more computationally efficient approach than more conventional eulerian techniques .",
    "sph replaces the fluid continuum with a finite number of particles which interact pairwise with each other , where the strength of that interaction is a function of the interparticle distance .",
    "the function is the _ kernel _ @xmath15 , and many choices for the kernel function are possible .",
    "the simplest choice would be a gaussian , but the consequence of this choice is the interaction force is non - zero for all other particles in the system .",
    "it is common to use a polynomial spline function which approximates a gaussian , but which has compact support , being identically zero beyond twice the _ smoothing length _",
    "@xmath16 ( monaghan & lattanzio 1985 ) . with this choice ,",
    "interparticle forces need only be calculated for neighbors within @xmath17 of a given particle . in the continuum limit",
    ", a field quantity can be estimated by the integral @xmath18 where the integration is over all space and where @xmath15 is defined such that @xmath19 to compute a field quantity using the finite number of sph particles within @xmath17 of @xmath20 , we have @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the mass of the @xmath23-th particle , @xmath24 is it s density , and @xmath25 is its position .",
    "a general form for the estimate of the derivative of a field quantity is given by @xmath26    the general form of the momentum and energy equations relevant for accretion disk studies are @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the specific internal energy , @xmath29 is the viscous force , @xmath30 is the energy generation from viscous dissipation , and @xmath31 are the displacements from stellar masses @xmath4 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "we assume an ideal gamma - law equation of state , @xmath33 , where we typically assume @xmath34 .",
    "our sph form of the momentum equation for a given particle @xmath35 is @xmath36 where we use a standard prescription for the artificial viscosity ( lattanzio 1986 ) @xmath37 where @xmath38 here @xmath39 is the average of the soundspeeds for particles @xmath35 and @xmath23 , and we use the notation @xmath40 , @xmath41 . in fitdisk , we fix @xmath42 , but the user can select the viscosity coefficients using a slider . note that as is typical in artificial viscosity formalisms , only approaching particles are subject to a viscous force .",
    "the internal energy of each particle is integrated using an action - reaction principle ( simpson & wood 1998 ) @xmath43 which is formally equivalent to the standard sph internal energy equation but computationally much more efficient .",
    "if this method fails , however , we then use the more standard form @xmath44 like all hydrodynamics calculations , the timesteps in fitdisk  are sound - speed limited . because physically the orbital period at the surface of a white dwarf is @xmath010 s , while the orbital period of the outer disk is @xmath01 h , it is advantageous to let individual particles have timesteps as short as needed",
    ". timesteps can be as long as @xmath45 , but a particle can have a shorter timestep @xmath46 as required by the local environment , where @xmath47 provides sufficient dynamic range for all simulations .",
    "the most common observation of superhumping cataclysmic variables is time series photometry ",
    "i.e. , sampling the brightness hundreds or more times per orbit .",
    "in fitdiskwe assume the sum over all particles of the changes in the internal energies over a time step @xmath48 is directly proportional to the luminosity of the disk over that same time interval .",
    "thus we can calculate an approximate `` light curve '' for the simulation : @xmath49    fitdisk  simulates the fluid dynamics of an accretion disk subject to the gravitational potential of the two stars in the system .",
    "the calculations are made in the inertial frame .",
    "we treat the stars as point masses on circular orbits , and the center of mass of the system is the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "particles are injected with thermal velocities @xmath50  k at random coordinates within a small box at the @xmath11 point .",
    "particles are considered to be lost from the system if they are accreted onto @xmath4 or @xmath32 , or are ejected from the system .",
    "our code specifically models accretion disks in the novalike systems .",
    "particles are injected in a burst at a rate of a few - thousand per orbit until the desired number of particles is reached .",
    "whenever a particle is lost , a replacement particle is injected at @xmath11 .",
    "thus , depending on the parameters of the simulation , the disk will either evolve to a state of quasi - equilibrium , or may eventually be driven into superhump oscillations .",
    "to port our research code from the linux operating system to the windowsxp operating system , we used compaq visual fortran and added a graphical user interface and visualization using opengl . to ensure that the machine requirements ( ram and hard drive space in particular ) are as minimal as possible while still allowing interesting results , we limit the total number of particles to 25,000 , although superhumps can be observed with as few as 1,000 particles in a run time of under 5 minutes , allowing direct usage in a classroom setting .",
    "the program uses about 100 mb of ram , so we recommend that systems have least 256 mb of ram for best results .",
    "recording 100 orbits of a 25,000-particle simulation at high resolution will require approximately 7.5 gb of disk space .",
    "we maintain a webpage for fitdisk  at www.astro.fit.edu/cv/fitdisk.html , and the executable code and a reference manual can be downloaded from that site .",
    "the download file is a zip archive containing fitdisk.exe and two auxillary files in a subfolder .",
    "these will extract to a directory named fitdisk .",
    "the initial release version of fitdisk  is v1.0 .",
    "we have set up a mechanism for users to send feedback at our website , and will release updates and bug fixes as needed , based on this feedback .",
    "figure  [ fig:1st - screen ] shows the startup screen , including a still image from a 25,000-particle simulation .",
    "figure  [ fig : gui ] shows the gui that comes up if file@xmath51new disk is selected .",
    "table  [ tab : table1 ] lists the adjustable parameters , their ranges , and default values .",
    "fitdisk  can be used to explore a significant volume of parameter space .",
    "when simulating a relatively small number of particles ( @xmath01000 ) , the code runs fast enough to watch the disk build and evolve to superhumps in real time .",
    "however , when calculating a simulation with the maximum number of particles evolved over enough time for superhumps to develop , even users with the latest hardware will probably want to record the results to the hard drive for next - day playback at a fast frame rate .",
    "this is accomplished using standard windows file requestors .",
    "simulations are visualized with smooth , double - buffered graphics .",
    "the view can be interactively rotated about a horizontal axis by clicking and dragging inside the window with either mouse button . the simulation can be paused ( see figure[fig : rotated ] ) , allowing an opportunity to examine structural details or capture screenshots using the windows prntscrn key . to provide more insight into the structure and dynamics involved ,",
    "the fluid particles are given false color based on their relative density or temperature as selected from the options menu .",
    "this feature gives an excellent qualitative picture of the radial density and temperature profiles , and also helps reveal features such as spiral shocks and superhumps .    within the program ,",
    "the frequencies present in the simulation light curves can be plotted and analyzed through use of an included fast fourier transform ( fft ) ( see figure[fig : lc+fft ] ) .",
    "time series plots show both the raw data and a boxcar - smoothed fit .",
    "the smoothed curve can appear markedly similar to the light curves observed in real systems , as we discuss below .",
    "the fourier amplitude spectrum is only shown out to a frequency of five cycles per orbit to highlight the frequency range of interest .",
    "peaks in the fft that are five or more standard deviations ( @xmath52 ) from the mean are labeled with their specific frequencies . in this way , for superhumping systems , the program often identifies the fundamental superhump frequency as well as the second and third harmonics .",
    "thus , users can explore the relationship between the superhump oscillation period and the orbital period as a function of binary system mass ratio .",
    ".[tab : table1 ] fitdisk  user - adjustable parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     when file@xmath51new disk is selected , the simulations begin with no particles present .",
    "the particles are injected in a burst at the @xmath11 point .",
    "the stream initially travels on a roughly ballistic trajectory until the lead particles intersect the stream .",
    "viscosity quickly causes the disk to collapse to the circularization radius , which has the same specific angular momentum as the particles entering at the @xmath11 point . over the next several orbits",
    "as the mass burst continues , viscosity acts to spread the mass out in both directions from the circularization radius .",
    "if the mass ratio @xmath53 and the viscosity parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 are of order unity , then eventually superhump oscillations will be driven into resonance by the rotating tidal field of the secondary .",
    "if the restart option is checked , then at a rate determined by the user the code will write out a file that can be read in so that the user can continue the simulation from that point",
    ". this might be useful if the user did nt specify sufficient orbits for superhumps to develop in a high - resolution simulation run .",

    "2005 ) , with an intuitive , easy - to - use graphical user interface added on and ported to the dominant operating system for pcs .",
