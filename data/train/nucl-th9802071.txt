    "in a recent paper @xcite we have developed a framework for the application of chiral perturbation theory to low energy elastic nucleon - nucleon scattering . in that framework a systematic expansion of the nn t - matrix in powers of small external momenta and quark masses is performed by evaluating tree and loop diagrams with vertices taken from an effective chiral lagrangian .",
    "the latter is an efficient tool to implement the ( chiral ) symmetry constraints on the dynamics of pions ( the goldstone bosons of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in qcd ) .",
    "since such an approach to nn - scattering focuses on the dynamics of pions it is expected to work within the kinematical domain where the nn force is dominated by one- and two - pion exchange .",
    "these are the peripheral nn partial waves below the inelastic @xmath6-threshold .    in ref.@xcite the @xmath3-exchange contributions were worked out up to third order in small momenta including one - loop graphs with a vertex from the second order chiral @xmath7-lagrangian @xmath8 .",
    "this part of the lagrangian involves several additional low - energy constants @xmath9 , which have been recently determined from a fit to many low energy pion - nucleon data @xcite . since some of these constants @xmath10 are much larger than the natural scale @xmath11 ( @xmath12 being the nucleon mass ) they indeed produce the major @xmath3-exchange effect in nn - scattering .",
    "in particular , the isoscalar central potential is almost entirely given by the constant @xmath13 proportional to the so - called nucleon axial polarizability @xcite .",
    "as shown in ref.@xcite it is the @xmath14-resonance that makes the dominant contribution to the low energy constants @xmath15 if one interprets their values in terms of resonance exchange .",
    "therefore the @xmath3-exchange effects proportional to @xmath16 as calculated in ref.@xcite can be approximately identified as single @xmath0-excitation graphs for which one has ignored the energy dependence of the @xmath0-propagator by using just a contact @xmath17-vertex . however , at the inelastic @xmath6-threshold the nucleon kinetic energy @xmath18 becomes comparable to the @xmath19-mass splitting of 293 mev , and a treatment of important @xmath0-dynamics via contact interactions may be too crude .",
    "this is also indicated by the results in ref.@xcite which show too large attraction in the f - waves above @xmath20 mev and in the d - waves even for smaller energies around 50 mev .",
    "one can expect that explicit @xmath14 degrees of freedom cure this problem ( at least partly ) .    in the past",
    "the @xmath0-excitation processes in nn - scattering have been considered in various approaches , either via dispersion theoretical methods @xcite or using @xmath21-transition potentials @xcite which neglect some ( technically complicated ) parts of the diagrams . at present no proper quantum field theoretical evaluation of these diagrams exists , which would avoid artificial `` form factors '' or cutoffs . as in ref.@xcite such `` form factors''are often introduced in order to enforce convergent loop integrals . in this work",
    "we evaluate the single and double @xmath0-excitation graphs in the static limit @xmath22 ( and also their first relativistic @xmath23-correction ) using covariant perturbation theory and dimensional regularization . in one - loop order to which we are working here the divergences of the diagrams",
    "show up only as purely polynomial nn - amplitudes which do not contribute to the phase shifts with orbital angular momentum @xmath24 and the mixing angles with @xmath25 .",
    "therefore we can study the effects due to @xmath0-excitation in a completely parameterfree fashion .",
    "next we consider , at two - loop order , the two - pion exchange diagrams involving the chiral @xmath2-interaction , so - called correlated @xmath3-exchange . in",
    "phenomenological approaches @xcite such processes are often identified with the enhancement around masses of 550 mev observed in the isoscalar central @xmath26 spectral function proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "such a behavior is found in the dispersion theoretical analyses of the @xmath7-scattering data @xcite and often called `` @xmath28-meson '' . after transforming the respective nn - amplitudes into a local coordinate space potential , we find that these two - loop diagrams involving the chiral @xmath2-interaction lead to rather different effects .",
    "in particular the resulting isoscalar central potential turns out to be weakly repulsive , contrary to common believe .",
    "the repulsive nature of isoscalar central potential finds its explanation in the isospin - zero s - wave @xmath2-amplitude which becomes repulsive sufficiently far below the threshold . in any case , all effects due to correlated @xmath3-exchange ( at two - loop ) that we find here in ( heavy baryon ) chiral perturbation theory are in fact negligibly small .",
    "this means that the enhancement showing up in the spectral function @xmath27 can not simply be identified with the ( perturbative two - loop ) correlated @xmath3-exchange diagram .",
    "with decreasing orbital angular momentum @xmath29 we find that the description of the empirical f - wave nn phase shifts above @xmath5 mev requires a further ( well - known ) ingredient , namely the exchange of vector mesons , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "while @xmath31-meson exchange ( using @xmath32 for its coupling constant ) provides the necessary overall repulsion , the @xmath30-meson with its large tensor - to - vector coupling ratio ( @xmath33 ) leads to the correct splitting of the singlet and the three triplet f - waves .    in d - waves we find deviations from the empirical nn phase shifts already at @xmath34 mev ( partly even for lower @xmath18 ) .",
    "for these low angular momentum partial waves the van der waals behavior of the @xmath3-exchange nn - potential becomes problematic , since its @xmath35-singularity practically extinguishes the natural centrifugal barrier effects coming from the wave function @xmath36 ( with @xmath37 a spherical bessel function ) . at such kinematics",
    "the short range nn - repulsion starts to become essential .",
    "its dynamical origin lies of course outside the perturbative interaction of point - like baryons and mesons treated here .",
    "for some recent attempts on this problem in the framework of effective field theory see ref.@xcite    we can summarize our work as follows : within systematic perturbation theory based on chiral symmetry one finds an accurate description of the empirical nn phase shifts in the partial waves with @xmath1 up to @xmath38 mev and partly up to 80 mev in d - waves with the following ingredients :    * point - like one - pion exchange ( without introducing an unmeasurable @xmath7 form factor ) * iterated one - pion exchange * irreducible two - pion exchange with only nucleons in intermediate states ( plus their first relativistic @xmath23-correction ) * two - pion exchange with single and double @xmath0-isobar excitation ( in the static limit ) * vector meson ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) exchange with standard values of the coupling constants but no ad hoc form factors    these components comprise the dynamics of the peripheral nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the emerging physical picture is of course not entirely new .",
    "however , our calculation is based on an effective chiral lagrangian and we apply rigorous methods of perturbative quantum field theory ( covariant feynman graphs and dimensional regularization ) .",
    "thus there is no need to introduce extra cut offs or ad hoc form factors which sometimes obscure the real physics .    on the experimental side",
    "there are upcoming precision data from the indiana cooler synchrotron facility ( iucf ) , which will lead to an improved nn phase shift analysis in the energy range below the pion production threshold .",
    "we propose to use the chiral nn phase shifts with @xmath1 presented here as input in a future phase shift analysis .",
    "in this section , we briefly review some basic formalism needed to describe elastic nucleon - nucleon scattering . in the center of mass frame the on - shell t - matrix for the process",
