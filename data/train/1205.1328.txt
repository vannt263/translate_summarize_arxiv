    "we assume the readers are somewhat familiar with the unruh effect @xcite on the one hand and the basic issues of quantum information on the other @xcite and will only highlight the relativistic aspects of both of these topics here .",
    "first , the quantum field acting as an environment to the discrete ( qubits ) or continuous variables ( oscillators ) in quantum information processing  we will refer to these point - like physical objects with internal degrees of freedom as detectors ( unruh - dewitt detector being the familiar one @xcite )  will necessarily exert environmental influences on the system .",
    "second , the motional states of the detectors ( e.g. , inertial or accelerated , uniformly or otherwise ) will affect both the quantum decoherence and entanglement dynamics of these detectors .",
    "the presence of a quantum field is unavoidable , as it acts as an ubiquitous environment to the qubits or detectors in question .",
    "two basic issues of quantum information need to be included in one s consideration are :    * quantum decoherence * coupling to a quantum field can induce decoherence of a single qubit or oscillator , but their mutual influences mediated by a field can lessen the degree of decoherence if the two qubits are placed in close range @xcite ; + * entanglement dynamics * the entanglement between two qubits or oscillators changes in time as their reduced state ( after coarse - graining over the field ) evolves ; it also depends on their spatial separation @xcite .",
    "+ * unruh effect * a uniformly accelerated detector coupled with a quantum field in the minkowski vacuum would experience a thermal bath of the field quanta at the unruh temperature proportional to its proper acceleration .",
    "this was first discovered by unruh using time - dependent perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "generalized considerations follow in the works of higuchi et al @xcite and louko et al @xcite .",
    "exact solutions going beyond these test - field descriptions were found by lin and hu @xcite with interesting new physics . + * non - uniform acceleration * the kinematical viewpoint has proven to be more malleable and adaptable than the traditional geometrical ( global concepts like event horizon ) viewpoint .",
    "we will mention how newer models in the 90s such as the rsg model @xcite , especially those which incorporate open quantum system concepts such as the rhak models @xcite , have aided in treating non - uniform acceleration , in work from the 90s ( e.g. , @xcite ) to now @xcite . + * mutual influences * the influence of one detector on the field will propagate in space and affect other detectors after some time . these causal mutual influences propagating back and forth",
    "is a source of non - markovianity in multi - detector theories .",
    "they act to augment the quantum coherence between two detectors placed in close range .",
    "another source of non - markovianity is the long range autocorrelation of the quantum field .",
    "furthermore , objects in a relativistic system may behave differently when observed in different reference frames , so we have : + * frame dependence * quantum entanglement of two objects localized at different positions on a spatial hypersurface is a kind of spacelike correlation , the time evolution of their entanglement will depend on how the spacetime is foliated by spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "+ * time dilation * for moving objects with worldlines parameterized by their proper times , their time dilations observed in a reference frame will naturally enter the dynamics in that frame .",
    "+ * projective measurement local in space * quantum states make sense only in a given frame where a hamiltonian is well defined @xcite .",
    "two quantum states of the same system with quantum fields in different frames are comparable only on those totally overlapping time - slices associated with certain moments in each frame . by a measurement local in space ,",
    "e.g. on a point - like ud detector coupled with a quantum field , quantum states of the combined system in different frames can be interpreted as if they collapsed on different time - slices passing through the same measurement event .",
    "nevertheless , the post - measurement states will evolve to the same state up to a coordinate transformation when they are compared at some time - slice in the future . in a two - detector system with the first detector being measured at some moment , the reduced state of the second detector collapsed in different frames",
    "will become consistent once it enters the future lightcone of the measurement event . @xcite .",
    "time - dependent perturbation theory ( tdpt ) was used by unruh originally to show the detector response to uniform acceleration .",
    "for a comprehensive description of unruh effect , see , e.g. , the recent review of @xcite . with the infusion of quantum open system ideas in the 90s these tdpt results were later found to hold only in the markovian regime , corresponding to the limits of ultra - high acceleration or ultra - weak coupling",
    ". discovery of exact solutions in the 2000s showed that the transition probability calculated from the infinite - time tdpt is valid only in transient under restricted conditions .",
    "we will develop the perturbative theory further in section 2 and comment on these developments in the last two sections . in section 3 we will introduce two other more general models for moving detector- quantum field interaction , namely , the rsg and the rhak models , treating the detectors as harmonic oscillators rather than the two level system as in the original unruh derivation .",
    "we will also bring in the broader scope provided by the theory of open quantum systems exemplified by the quantum brownian model , where the use of reduced density matrix and influence functionals opens the way to exploring the full parameter range of detector - field interaction including self - consistent backreaction .",
    "this opens the door for quantum information inquires . in section 4",
    "we describe the detector - field dynamics from the exact solutions of one such model , and identify the limitations of tdpt . in section 5",
    "we give an important example of relativistic quantum information , that of quantum teleportation which uses pretty much all of the relativistic and quantum information elements developed , such as frame dependence and entanglement dynamics .",
    "we end with some suggestions on further developments .",
    "in this section we summarise recent results about the transition rate of a pointlike detector within linear perturbation theory , in situations where neither the detector trajectory nor the state of the quantum field is assumed stationary  @xcite .",
    "the central issue is to isolate switch - on and switch - off effects from phenomena that are genuinely due to the acceleration and to the state of the field .",
    "we consider a pointlike _ two - level _ detector that moves in a spacetime of dimension @xmath0 along the worldline  @xmath1 , where the parameter @xmath2 is the detector s proper time .",
    "the motion is driven by an external agent who is decoupled from the detector s internal degrees of freedom and from the quantum field to which the detector couples .",
    "the detector s internal hilbert space here is two - dimensional , spanned by the orthonormal basis states @xmath3 and @xmath4 whose respective energy eigenvalues are @xmath5 and  @xmath6 , with @xmath7 . for @xmath8 , @xmath3 is the ground state and @xmath4 is the excited state ; for @xmath9 , the roles of the states are reversed .",
    "a  generalisation to a countable number of nondegenerate energy eigenstates would be straightforward .",
    "the spacetime contains a free real scalar field  @xmath10 , whose mass and curvature coupling parameter may be arbitrary .",
    "the detector is coupled to @xmath10 linearly , by the interaction picture hamiltonian @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the coupling constant and @xmath13 is the detector s monopole moment operator . the switching function @xmath14 specifies how the interaction is turned on and off .",
    "we assume @xmath14 to be smooth , nonnegative and of compact support .",
    "we also assume the trajectory @xmath1 to be smooth .",
    "we denote the initial state of the field by @xmath15 , and we assume @xmath15 to be regular in the sense of the hadamard property  @xcite . the detector is initially prepared in the state  @xmath3 .",
    "we work within first - order perturbation theory in  @xmath12 .",
    "after the interaction has ceased , the probability for the detector to be found in the state @xmath4 , regardless the final state of the field , is @xcite @xmath16 where the response function @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 and the correlation function @xmath19 is the pull - back of the wightman function to the detector s worldline .",
    "the prefactor @xmath20 in ( [ eq : prob ] ) depends only on the detector s internal structure , while @xmath17 ( [ eq : respfunc - alt ] ) encodes the dependence on  @xmath15 , the trajectory and the switching . with minor abuse of terminology",
    ", we refer to @xmath17 as the transition probability .      while formula ( [ eq : respfunc - alt ] ) for the transition probability is as such well defined , it is not well suited for discussing how the probability depends on the switching function , especially when the switching becomes sharp .",
    "the correlation function @xmath21 is not a genuine function but a distribution .",
    "when @xmath21 is represented by a family @xmath22 of functions that converge to @xmath21 as @xmath23 , the sense of convergence entails that the limit @xmath23 is taken in ( [ eq : respfunc - alt ] ) only _ after _ the integrals are evaluated  @xcite .",
    "the sharp switching limit may hence not necessarily be brought under the integrals and the @xmath23 limit in ( [ eq : respfunc - alt ] )  @xcite .",

    "the crucial point is that in addition to an expected integral term that involves  @xmath31 , there are also additional terms that depend on the switching .",
    "these additional terms are remnants of the distributional singularity of  @xmath21 , and they are absent only for @xmath25 , where the singularity of @xmath21 is merely logarithmic .",
    "the hadamard property of the wightman function guarantees that the integrals in ( [ eq:2respfunc])([probability ] ) are convergent at @xmath32 .",
    "we assume that any singularities of @xmath31 at @xmath33 are integrable .",
    "such singularities can occur for example when the spacetime has spatial periodicity so that points on the detector s trajectory can be joined by null geodesics that circumnavigate the space  @xcite .",
    "when both the detector trajectory and the quantum state of the field are stationary , in the sense that they are invariant under a killing vector that is timelike in a neighbourhood of the trajectory , a transition rate per unit time may be defined by making the switching function time - independent and formally factoring out the infinite total time of detection @xcite . in time - dependent situations",
    "this procedure is however not available , and separating the switching effects from the acceleration effects becomes delicate @xcite .    to define a transition rate in the nonstationary setting ,",
    "we consider the limit in which the detector is switched on an off sharply .",

    "this divergent term depends on the details of the switching but it is constant in time , and it is also independent of the trajectory and of the quantum state .",
    "the divergent term does hence not contribute to the transition rate .",
    "physically , the @xmath37 limit means that we take the switching to be rapid compared with the overall duration of the interaction : focusing on the transition rate allows us to discard from the transition probability the numerically dominant piece that only depends on the details of the switching .",

    "we re - emphasise , however , that formulas ( [ eq:2tranrate])([eq : ss:6d : transrate ] ) apply in genuinely time - dependent situations .    a showcase example is a minkowski spacetime trajectory that is asymptotically inertial at early times and of asymptotically uniform linear acceleration at late times , with the field in the minkowski vacuum .",
    "within the perturbative treatment , the transition rate is duly found @xcite to interpolate between that in inertial motion and that in uniform linear acceleration , describing thus the onset of the unruh effect  @xcite .",

    "slowly - varying acceleration is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "to end this section , we mention two alternative definitions of the transition rate .",
    "first , the transition rate of a pointlike detector in flat spacetime can be defined by first giving the detector a spatial size , specified covariantly in terms of the detector s instantaneous rest frame , and at the end taking the pointlike limit  @xcite .",
    "the results agree with those obtained via smooth switching in the common domain of validity @xcite .",
    "a  related procedure that replaces spatial size by a pole prescription in proper time is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "second , a spatially extended detector in flat spacetime can be reinterpreted as a pointlike detector with an energy cutoff that is specified covariantly in the detector s instantaneous rest frame  @xcite . definition of the transition rate via this energy cutoff can be generalised to curved spacetimes at least when the spacetime has a sufficient amount of symmetry  @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanics for the single particles in some non - linear potentials such as anharmonic oscillators , morse potential , etc .",
    "are exactly solvable .",
    "but in field theory , since a field has infinitely many degrees of freedom , a small non - linearity can create huge difficulty in calculations .",
    "one can at most do perturbation theory or self - consistent approximations around some non - trivial background field configuration , where the calculation involves essentially gaussian integrals . however , if the potential of the detector is that of a harmonic oscillator ( ho ) and the quantum state is in a gaussian form , it is possible to solve the full dynamics of the combined system of the detectors and the field non - perturbatively .",
    "a notable non - perturbative model is that of raine , sciama , and grove @xcite , where they found the late - time expectation values for the stress tensor of a massless scalar field in ( 1 + 1)d minkowski space .",
    "the method is generalized to the case with a point - like ud detector in a massless scalar field in ( 3 + 1)d minkowski space , and the whole history of the combined system is solved in @xcite .",
    "suppose the internal degrees of freedom of the ud detector are hos .",
    "then the combined system of @xmath51 ud detectors and a quantum field is an @xmath52-ho system , which is linear and exactly solvable .",
    "unruh and zurek @xcite have studied a model where a hamonic oscillator interacts with a massless scalar field in 2-d .",
    "they derived the exact master equation for the reduced density matrix of the system ( oscillator ) at a temperature determined by the initial state of the field , and observed some general features different from the conventional markovian results valid for an ohmic bath at ultra - high temperature made known earlier in the famous paper of caldeira and leggett @xcite .",
    "one feature is the dependence of the ultraviolet cut - off in the master equation and the reduced density matrix , and thus also in the von neumann entropy of the system .",
    "more general non - markovian behavior was explored by hu , paz and zhang @xcite who derived an exact master equation with nonlocal dissipation and colored noise for the system of one harmonic oscillator ( detector ) interacting with a thermal bath of n - harmonic oscillators . for quantum decoherence",
    "they identified the low temperature , supra - ohmic regime as a noticeable departure from the markovian behavior ( see followup in @xcite ) . using this model as a theoretical tool with the help of quantum open system ideas ,",
    "many of the basic issues we listed in the beginning can be addressed effectively .",
    "generalizing a bath of n - harmonic oscillators of time - dependent frequencies to a quantum field was subsequently done by hu and matacz @xcite for moving detectors- quantum field interactions . because the treatment is given in quantum optics language  the quantum states described by the squeeze , rotation and displacement operators and the dynamics in terms of parametric amplification  their results are immediately applicable to  atomic - mirror \"- optical systems @xcite .",
    "it also served the intended purpose of bringing open systems methods and concepts to quantum field theory .",
    "the influence functional treatment they used incorporates the backreaction of the environment on the system ( which could be either the quantum field or the harmonic oscillator depending on what one is after ) in a self - consistent way .",
    "in particular they showed how the unruh and hawking temperatures can be identified from the noise kernel using this method .",
    "viewing the unruh effect from this perspective , since in the qbm model there are nontrivial activities at zero temperature @xcite , we note that even for the zero acceleration @xmath53 case the detector is not just laying idle but has interesting physical features due to its interaction with the vacuum fluctuations in the quantum field .      a model of n detectors in arbitrary relativistic motion interacting with a common quantum field ( but not with each other ) was proposed by raval , hu , anglin @xcite .",
    "they calculated the influence of quantum fields on the detectors in motion , and the mutual influence of detectors by the action of fields via the langevin equations derived from the influence functional .",
    "they introduced the notion of self and mutual impedance , advanced and retarded noise , and the new relations between noise - correlations and dissipation - propagation .",
    "they show the existence of general fluctuation - dissipation relations , and for trajectories without event horizons , correlation - propagation relations .",
    "raval , hu and koks @xcite used this model to explore different trajectories of the moving detectors in a quantum field and showed that this is a more feasible way ( over the traditional global geometric view which relies on the existence of event horizons ) to address situations where the spacetime possesses an event horizon only asymptotically , or none at all .",
    "examples studied there include detectors moving at uniform acceleration only asymptotically or for a finite time , a moving mirror , and a two - dimensional collapsing mass .",
    "they show that in such systems radiance indeed is observed , albeit not in a precise planckian spectrum .",
    "the setups in this model have been adopted in the study of charge particle motion by johnson et al @xcite in an electromagnetic field and by galley et al @xcite for the self - force of masses moving in a gravitational field .",

    "in fact all kinds of fields , massless or massive , bosonic or fermionic , can be considered , depending on the physics one aims at .",
    "the detectors do not have to be uniformly accelerated ( e.g. , @xcite ) or at rest .",
    "however , the motion of the detector here are assumed to be controlled by external agents , in other words , the trajectories or worldlines of the detectors are prescribed and not dynamical .",
    "if the motion of the detector becomes dynamical , it is extremely hard to get analytical results even in classical theory ( for example , a relativistic charge in a field in classical @xcite and quantum field theory @xcite ) , since including backreaction of the field on the detector will alter its ( test - field ) prescribed trajectory .",
    "trajectories of charged particles @xcite and even extended objects @xcite determined by their interplay with the quantum field have also been studied before using the influence functional method which is particularly suited to treating consistent backreaction effects .",
    "the first noticeable attractive feature of ( [ stot1 ] ) is that this model is linear and thus easy to treat .",
    "it is arguably the simplest model for an  atom \"-",
    "field interacting system but complex enough to give nontrivial results and insights . by ",
    "atom \" here we refer to a spatially - localized physical object with internal degrees of freedom . by field",
    ", we categorically refer to dynamical variables which can be non - local in space . in some simple setups",
    "analytic results can be obtained in the whole parameter range , and back - reaction to both the atom and the field can be fully studied with the help of quantum open systems techniques .    moreover , in a relativistic setting , such as for uniformly accelerated detectors or black holes , event horizons for the detectors can be sharply defined since the detectors are always localized .",
    "also since the detectors are pointlike , they are allowed to be parametrized by their own proper times , which are invariants under coordinate transformations .",
    "this greatly simplifies the calculations in different reference frames when the related physics correspond only to the two - point correlators of the detectors parametrized by two proper times .",
    "note that this is even plausible for extended objects in the spirit of effective field theory @xcite .",
    "for a uniformly accelerated ud detector in ( 3 + 1)d with proper acceleration @xmath65 the unruh effect @xcite attests that it should behave the same way as an inertial ud detector in contact with a thermal bath at unruh temperature @xmath66 , or more precisely , as an inertial harmonic oscillator in contact with an ohmic bath at @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "however , examining this from the vantage point of the exact solutions we obtained , we see the above statements are accurate only at the initial moment . after the coupling is switched on , the quantum state of the field will have been changed by the detector , so the field is no longer in the minkowski vacuum and it does not make exact sense to say that the detector is immersed in a thermal state ( or any state defined in the test - field description , i.e. , where the field is assumed not to be modified by the presence of the detector ) .    a theorem by bisognano and wichmann ( bw ) @xcite states that the minkowski vacuum , which is uniquely characterized by its invariance under all poincar translations , is a kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) state with respect to all observables confined to a rindler wedge .",
    "it does not apply here because the bw theorem refers to the vacuum state of a quantum field alone , not the combined detector - field system .",
    "even when the combined system is in a steady state , the quantum state of the interacting field is not invariant under spatial translations in minkowski space , hence does not subscribe to the assumption of the bw theorem pertaining to poincar invariance .",
    "actually the planck factor in , for example , ( eq.(60 ) in ref.@xcite ) , @xmath67 , \\label{planck}\\ ] ] is a consequence of the bw theorem .",
    "nevertheless , it is derived from only the free - field - solution part of the complete interacting field .",
    "here the factor is not distorted by the interaction simply because the field is linear and the coupling is bilinear . for nonlinear fields or couplings it would have a nonplanckian spectrum and the departure from the conventional picture would be more pronounced .",
    "nonperturbatively solvable models such as ( [ stot1 ] ) are particularly useful for examining the full features of a system which perturbative theories miss or misrepresent .",
    "they are essential for understanding new physics such as that associated with quantum entanglement whose dynamical behavior we do nt really have a complete or accurate knowledge about .",
    "we now continue to develop the model ( [ stot1 ] ) .",

    "boils down to solving the time - dependent factors in the wigner function .",
    "since the field variables at some moment @xmath75 are defined on the whole time - slice associated with @xmath75 , the density matrix or wigner functions at @xmath75 is also defined on that time - slice . in the schrdinger picture ,",
    "the evolution of a density matrix ( wigner function ) is governed by the master equation ( fokker - planck equation ) .",

    "<S> we review unruh - dewitt detectors and other models of detector - field interaction in a relativistic quantum field theory setting as a tool for extracting detector - detector , field - field and detector - field correlation functions of interest in quantum information science , from entanglement dynamics to quantum teleportation . </S>",
    "<S> we in particular highlight the contrast between the results obtained from linear perturbation theory which can be justified provided switching effects are properly accounted for , and the nonperturbative effects from available analytic expressions which incorporate the backreaction effects of the quantum field on the detector behaviour . </S>"
