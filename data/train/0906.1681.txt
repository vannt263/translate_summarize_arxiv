    "anharmonicity in lattice vibrations has been one of the old problems in condensed - matter physics@xcite .",
    "anharmonic effects in acoustic phonons were treated by perturbation theory@xcite , while those in local vibrations were investigated in impurities or disordered systems @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that the effects of the anharmonicity in local vibrations appear in the characteristic temperature dependence of the vibrational frequency and of the line width@xcite . since an isolated irregular atom receives an anharmonic potential from the regular lattice , analysis",
    "have been made mostly on the anharmonic oscillation receiving effects of surrounding oscillation of the regular lattice .",
    "recently a revised interest on anharmonic phonons has arisen in relation to a material series of pyrochlore oxides @xcite , filled skutterdites@xcite and clathrates@xcite .",
    "those materials , which are usually electrical conductors like metals , semimetals or heavily - doped semiconductors , have a common feature that some numbers of atoms form a three - dimensional network of polyhedral cages , in each of which a guest ions is accommodated . when the cages are oversized , the guest ion vibrates with a large amplitude in an anharmonic potential .",
    "such vibrations are named as _ the rattling phonons_. to note ,",
    "depending on kinds of guest ions , on - centering or off - centering vibrations occur even in the same cage structure .",
    "there have been reported various anomalous phenomena in the above materials , some of which have been discussed in relation to those rattling phonons@xcite . in applying some clathrate compounds to thermoelectric material devices , for example , the rattling phonons ,",
    "in particular off - centered , are expected to suppress strongly the thermal conductivity by effectively scattering debye - like acoustic phonons propagating through the cage network and carrying heat entropy @xcite .",
    "an alternative example is found in the superconductivity in a @xmath0-pyrochlore oxide kos@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "it was suggested that rattling vibrations of the k@xmath3 in the oso@xmath2 octahedral cage were responsible for the strong - coupling superconductivity and also for an electron - mass enhancement@xcite .",
    "it may be fair , however , to state that these interesting issues as for the question how rattling phonons interact with cage acoustic phonons and/or charge carriers are far from being well understood@xcite .",
    "so far lattice vibrational modes including rattling phonons in the above cage materials have been studied rather extensively with use of spectroscopic measurements such as inelastic neutron and raman scatterings@xcite .",
    "some low - lying rattling modes are clarified to exhibit softening with decreasing temperatures .",
    "the softening phenomenon has been well recognized as one of the anharmonic effects from rattling phonons , which was discussed with a quasi - harmonic approximation@xcite . beside these spectroscopies , an infrared - active optical measurements , particularly in the terahertz range ,",
    "would be , in principle , a powerful tool to clarify the charge dynamics in low - lying optical phonons near @xmath4 with available optical conductivity spectra .",
    "recently , time - domain terahertz spectroscopy@xcite has been successfully applied for the first time to observe the rattling phonons around 1thz in a type - i clathrate ba@xmath5ga@xmath6ge@xmath7 ( bgg ) @xcite . in this paper , we investigate systematically the optical conductivity spectra from the rattling phonons in an on - centered and off - centered potential , and apply the obtained theoretical classification of the spectra to analyse the experimental result of bgg .",
    "the detail of the experiment will be presented elsewhere@xcite .",
    "we express the optical conductivity by level transitions among states in an anharmonic potential@xcite .",
    "the present analysis shows that the most important effect of an anharmonic potential is the non - equal energy spacing of level transitions , resulting in an intrinsic and asymmetric spread of the excitation spectral , in contrast to the harmonic case of the equal energy spacing simply resulting in the lorentzian spectral shape . also there",
    "arise variety of level schemes for low - lying states depending on an on - centered or off - centered potential .",
    "those features induce the natural broadening of the line width at higher temperature , softening of the peak frequency@xcite and multi - peak structures at low temperature in optical conductivity .    in the present paper ,",
    "a one - dimensional model is used for simplicity .",
    "essential effects from the anharmonicity are included .",
    "in the next section , the model and the expression of the optical conductivity are presented . in sect.3",
    "some of numerical results are presented .",
    "comparison with the recent experiment@xcite is discussed .",
    "sect.4 is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "as a model to describe the motion of a guest ion in the cage , we take the following one - dimensional anharmonic potential model , for simplicity , @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the mass , momentum and spatial coordinate of the guest ion , respectively .",
    "we neglect effects of acoustic phonons and electrons .",
