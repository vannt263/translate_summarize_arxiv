    "the origin of lfv would be related to the structure of the fundamental theory at high energies .",
    "therefore , new physics models can be explored by measuring the lfv processes . in the minimal supersymmetric sm with heavy right - handed neutrinos ( mssmrn ) ,",
    "the lfv yukawa interactions can be radiatively generated via the slepton mixing  @xcite .",
    "the slepton mixing can be induced by the running effect from the neutrino yukawa interaction even when flavour blind structure is realized at the grand unification scale  @xcite .",

    "we note that when @xmath36 and @xmath65 ( in the mssm , this automatically realizes for @xmath66 gev ) signal from both @xmath67 and @xmath68 can be used to measure the lfv parameters , while the cross section for @xmath69 is suppressed .    in fig .",

    "the cross section can be around @xmath76 fb with the maximal allowed values for @xmath77 under the constraint from the @xmath32 data .",

    "the cross sections are sensitive to the polarization of the electron beam",

    "because of the different dependencies on the parameters in the model , @xmath38 can be sensitive than the lfv higgs boson production for very high @xmath113 with fixed higgs boson mass .",
