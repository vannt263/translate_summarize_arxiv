    "the wave function is normalized according to @xmath23    following the physical literatures @xcite , introducing the rescaling : @xmath24 , @xmath25 with @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , we get the following dimensionless gpe under the normalization ( [ norm ] ) in 3d : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    to find the stationary solution of ( [ gpe2 ] ) , we write @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the chemical potential of the condensate and @xmath35 is a function independent of time . substituting ( [ state - az ] ) into ( [ gpe2 ] ) gives the following equation for @xmath36 : @xmath37 under the normalization condition ( [ norm ] ) with @xmath38 .",
