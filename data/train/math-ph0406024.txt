    "its tremendous success in localizing the singularities of fields and signals is mainly due to its mutual locality in coordinate and momentum : a local disturbance of wavelet coefficients affects the reconstructed image only _ locally _ , without spoiling the whole picture .    formally",
    "the wavelet decomposition of a vector @xmath1 in a hilbert space @xmath2 is a decomposition with respect to the square - integrable representation @xmath3 of the affine group @xmath4 acting transitively on @xmath2 @xcite , written as follows : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a left - invariant measure on @xmath7 and @xmath8 is an appropriately chosen vector , called a basic wavelet .    in practical applications ,",
    "@xmath2 usually is the space of square - integrable functions @xmath9 , and the basic wavelet @xmath10 is a certain compactly supported function in it .",
    "the power of the wavelet transform is due to the fact that the analyzing window function @xmath11(x ) = |a|^{-1/2 } \\psi\\left(\\frac{x - b}{a}\\right)$ ] has the width varying with the scale parameter @xmath12 , and thus works as a microscope that locally analyzes the details of a given scale .",
    "bearing in mind the application to the functions of @xmath0-adic argument rather than @xmath9 , we modify the definitions of direct and inverse wt in @xmath13-norm as follows : @xmath14 where @xmath15 for the case of affine group @xmath16 , where tilde means the fourier transform .    before defining wavelet transform in @xmath17 , it is worth noting that both wavelet transform and @xmath0-adic numbers provide hierarchic description of reality .",
    "say , @xmath0-adic integers , defined by below , for @xmath18 describe a point of the unit interval @xmath19 in terms of the embedded set of its vicinities , halved in size at each step .",
    "to some extent , a @xmath0-adic integer labels an analog point in a @xmath20-dimensional simplex partitioned in a self - similar way into @xmath0 parts on each iteration , see fig .  [ trg2:pic ] for two dimensional example . since the @xmath21-dimensional sphere @xmath22 is homeomorphic to the boundary of @xmath23 dimensional simplex , it is possible to label the points of @xmath22 using the coordinates on that simplex .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in _ section 2",
    "_ we review the basic facts on @xmath0-adic numbers , their geometrical interpretation and consider a few constructions of @xmath0-adic wavelet transform .",
    "an implementation of the @xmath0-adic wt with the haar wavelet is presented . in _ section 3 _",
    ", we define @xmath0-adic wt with haar wavelet .",
    "_ section 4 _ presents the hilbert space of states of hierarchic quantum systems and considers possible links to @xmath0-adic wavelet transform .",
    "a generalization of quantum computation on qubit states is extended in _ section 5 _ to quantum systems constructed from elementary units with @xmath24 states .",
    "prior to defining @xmath0-adic wavelet transform , let us review the basic facts about @xmath0-adic numbers .",
    "the results of any physical measurement can be expressed in terms of rational numbers @xmath25 .",
    "the construction of a theoretical model , first of all a description in terms of differential equations , ultimately requires an extension of this field . the first extension ( made by dedekind , viz .",
    "equivalence classes ) means the incorporation of rational numbers .",
    "it is a completion of the field @xmath26 with respect to the standard norm @xmath27 .",
    "however , this completion does not exhaust all possibilities .",
    "it is also possible to extend the field @xmath26 using the _ p - adic norm _ @xmath28 ( to be explained below ) : @xmath29 this completion is called the field of @xmath0-adic numbers @xmath17 .",
    "no other extensions of @xmath26 except those two exist due to the ostrovski theorem @xcite .    the @xmath0-adic norm @xmath30 is defined as follows . any nonzero rational number @xmath31 can be uniquely written in the form @xmath32 where integers @xmath33 and @xmath34 are not divisible by the prime integer @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is an integer .",
    "the decomposition ( [ pdec ] ) provides a possibility to supply the field @xmath26 with the norm @xmath37 different from the standard one .",
    "the algebraic closure of the field @xmath26 in the norm @xmath38 forms the field of @xmath0-adic numbers @xmath17 .",
    "any @xmath0-adic number can be uniquely written in the form @xmath39 it is easy to see that @xmath40 but @xmath38 is stronger than @xmath41 : @xmath42 and induces a non - archimedian metric @xmath43 often called an _ ultrametric _ @xcite . with respect to the metric ( [ pdist ] ) , the @xmath17 becomes a complete metric space .",
    "the maximal compact subring of @xmath17 @xmath44 is referred to as _ a set of p - adic integers_. the field @xmath17 admits a positive haar measure , unique up to normalization @xmath45 the normalization is often chosen as @xmath46 .",
    "the geometry induced by the distance @xmath47 is quite different from the euclidean one : all @xmath0-adic triangles are equilateral ; two @xmath0-adic balls may either be one within another or disjoint .",
    "there is no unique definition of differentiation in the field @xmath17 , but the fourier transform exists and is used in @xmath0-adic field theory to construct the pseudo - differential operator @xmath48 the construction of the @xmath0-adic fourier transform is essentially based on the group structure of the field @xmath17 , viz .",
    "the group of additive characters @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 denotes the _ fractional part _ of @xmath51 : @xmath52 ) , is used to construct the fourier transform @xmath53 the @xmath34-dimensional generalization is straightforward .",
    "@xmath54 now , let us show how @xmath0-adic coordinates can be used to label the points of ( @xmath55)-dimensional manifolds .",
    "let us consider a ( @xmath55)-dimensional simplex , a triangle for @xmath56 is shown in fig .",

    "if the the unit measure is assigned to the initial simplex , the volume of each subpart coincides with the norm of the @xmath0-adic number it is labeled by.,width=226 ]    we can divide our 2d simplex , shown in fig .",
    "[ trg2:pic ] , into into @xmath57 equal equilateral triangles and label them by 0,1,2,3 .",
    "the initial triangle is therefore subdivided into @xmath58 equal parts ; since the same procedure can be also applied to its parts we can move down _ ad infinum _ and label these parts as @xmath59 , where @xmath60 .",
    "if we ascribe a measure @xmath61 to the initial triangle , when at the first stage we have @xmath0 triangles of the measure @xmath62 each , at the second stage @xmath63 triangles of the measure @xmath64 and so on . to meet this natural definition of the measure , we can label the sequences @xmath65 by @xmath0-adic integers .",
    "generally , a @xmath21-dimensional simplex can be divided into @xmath66 equal parts , but to some extent we can consider @xmath0-adic balls as vicinities of points in a compact ultrametric space with a geometry similar to @xmath22 partitioning shown in fig .  [ trg2:pic ] .",
    "having defined the integration in @xmath17 by , we can formally generalize the continuous wavelet transform to the affine group acting in @xmath17 @xcite : @xmath67 as it follows from the group multiplication law @xmath68 the left invariant measure on @xmath0adic affine group , up to normalization , has the form @xmath69 which provides @xmath70 to construct a counterpart wavelet transform ( [ dwt],[iwt ] ) for the @xmath0-adic affine group , we use an obvious definition scalar product of complex - valued functions of @xmath0-adic arguments , @xmath71 which provides a functional norm @xmath72 .",
    "thus the direct generalization of ( [ dwt],[iwt ] ) takes the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "an analog of the complex - valued morlet wavelet have been constructed by s.kozyrev @xcite.this complex valued wavelet is constructed from additive character of the field @xmath17 used in @xmath0-adic fourier transform , and has the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 is characteristic function of the unit interval in @xmath25 .",
    "the kozyrev wavelets are eigenfunctions of the vladimirov p - adic pseudoderivative @xcite : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the haar measure on @xmath17 .",
    "concerning the discrete implementation of the @xmath0-adic wavelet transform , the most evident implementation is that with haar wavelet .",
    "haar wavelet is the simplest case of the basic wavelet @xmath79 using the scale factor @xmath80 , we easily obtain the discrete representation of the affine group ( @xmath13 norm is used ) @xmath81 and the wavelet coefficients @xmath82 = \\int 2^{-j } h(2^{-j}x - k ) f(x ) dx.\\ ] ] then , forward and backward discrete wavelet transform with the haar wavelet can be then easily evaluated using the laplacian pyramidal scheme @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the initial data set , and two projections @xmath85 are evaluated on each step ; @xmath86 is evidently the `` blurred '' version of the previous level coefficients @xmath87 , with @xmath88 being the details blurred out .",
    "the reconstruction from the haar wavelet decomposition is @xmath89    similar fast algorithms can be constructed for a @xmath0-adic haar wavelet .",
    "we define an analog of the haar wavelet in @xmath17 as @xmath90 where `` -1 '' means @xmath91 or @xmath92 , depending on whether @xmath93 is a complex - valued @xmath94 or a @xmath0-adic - valued function @xmath95 . in the latter case",
    ", the pyramidal algorithm ( [ dhwt],[ihwt ] ) for the haar wavelet is exactly reproduced in @xmath0-adic arithmetics @xmath96 with the reconstruction formulae @xmath97",
    "the quantum mechanical description based on the schrdinger equation is formally applicable to any physical system from elementary particles to macroscopic bodies .",
    "however , it is technically impossible to account for each electron wave function in a living cell or in a microprocessor , or even in a big cluster of atoms .",
    "the methods of quantum statistical mechanics are of little use here , for most quantum systems of practical interest are far from statistical equilibrium .    at the same time",
    ", the problem of quantum description of mesoscopic objects , such as clusters of atoms and living cells , are becoming of steady practical interest for high - performance computing and biotechnology .",
    "fortunately , there is a way to construct the wave functions of composite objects without taking the direct product of all component wave functions . as we always see",
    ", the nature has clearly manifested its hierarchic structure : an electron is part of atom , an atom is part of a molecule .",
    "this suggests that instead of taking the direct product of the component wave functions , we can represent the wave function of a composite system in a hierarchic form , successively taking into account the states of all systems our system is part of .",
    "this suggests an idea of the hierarchic wave function @xcite .",
    "let the system @xmath98 consist of two subsystems @xmath99 and @xmath100 , each of those in turn consists of two subsystems , , see fig .",
    "[ hier1:pic ] .        to describe the binary hierarchic system shown in fig .",
    "[ hier1:pic ] , we need a collection of wave functions @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the wave function of the whole ( labeled by @xmath98 ) , and @xmath103 is the wave function of a _ component _ @xmath99 belonging to the entity @xmath98 .",
    "the subsystem @xmath99 of @xmath98 described by the wave function @xmath103 is not the same as a free system @xmath99 described by wave function @xmath104 ; an electron in atom is not the same as a free electron .",
    "the component wave function , that completely determines the state of the subsystem @xmath105 is then @xmath106 .",
    "if required , the density matrix of such a system can be obtained by averaging over degrees of freedom of @xmath98 and @xmath99 , but not the @xmath100 , see @xcite for details .    evidently , the binary tree structure presented above is a mathematical idealization : there is no _ a priory _ reason for the subsystem to have exactly the same number of parts as the system it is part of .",
    "this idealization , however , seems to be a good starting point to build a hilbert space of states of hierarchic system .",
    "having the same number of parts at each hierarchy level , and thus being self - similar , the presented construction of the hierarchic wave function gives us a quantum mechanics on @xmath17 , where @xmath0 is the number of subparts .",
    "let us consider the hilbert space of hierarchic wave functions @xcite .",
    "if @xmath107 and @xmath108 are two hierarchic wave functions ( describing the same type hierarchic objects ) , then the superposition principle requires their linear combination to be in the same hilbert space @xmath109 for instance , if @xmath110 then their linear combination is @xmath111 the scalar product is defined componentwise : @xmath112 the norm of the vector in hierarchic space defined by scalar product is a sum of norms of all components : @xmath113 for a self - similar partitioning , if the number ( @xmath0 ) of subparts is the same at all hierarchic levels , we can easily cast the properties ( [ multilin]-[mnorm ] ) for the wave functions of @xmath0-adic argument @xmath114 .",
    "let @xmath115 then , we can define the hierarchic wave function component as @xmath116 with normalization condition @xmath117 at this point we ought to mention the geometric aspect of the hierarchic wave function . if @xmath118 labels an entity , and @xmath119 labels the parts of this entity , then the haar measure @xmath120 normalized as @xmath121 provides that the measure the wave function @xmath122 is integrated over is exactly @xmath62 of the measure of the entity @xmath123 .",
    "this impose a particular geometry to the quantum mechanics of hierarchic wave functions @xmath124 , which may , or may not , correspond to physical reality .",
    "the second quantization on hierarchic states also has its own peculiarities .",
    "to create a state vector of a hierarchic state , we have first to create the entity ( @xmath98 ) , and only then , we can create its parts acting by appropriate creation operators to the state @xmath125 . @xmath126",
    "the latter equation means the annihilation of the entity @xmath98 in a system comprised by components @xmath127 : this is a decay of @xmath98 into components .",
    "the possible action of annihilation operator of a part @xmath127 in entity @xmath98 @xmath128 is questionable .",
    "if a toy model with the same number of parts at each hierarchy level is considered , the second quantization rules provide a second quantization for the state vectors labeled by @xmath0-adic numbers .",
    "the hierarchic state vector can be created by sequential action of creation operators @xmath129 where second quantization @xmath130=\\delta_{ij}$ ] is defined on the cyclic group @xmath131 rather than a ring of @xmath0-adic integers .",
    "qubit , a quantum analog of a classical bit , is a superposition of any two orthogonal quantum states , labeled as `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' for definiteness @xmath132 qubit is an elementary unit of quantum information .",
    "strings of qubits @xmath133 are considered as analogues of classical computer registers . the general review in quantum information can be found elsewhere , see @xcite .",
    "the idea of qubit , a superposition of two quantum states , comes from the fact that it is easy to prepare such states , a spin system or a two - level atom .",
    "nevertheless , quantum systems with more than two orthogonal states are also known : the potts model , atoms with 3 and more states .",
    "interestingly , it is very likely that the processing of genetic information in living cell operates as a quantum information processing in mod 4 or mod 5 arithmetics @xcite .",
    "so , we need a generalization of qubit to a superposition of ( @xmath24 ) orthogonal quantum states . we will call it @xmath0-qubit .",
    "a particular generalization of this type , a pentabit @xmath134 , has been proposed in @xcite @xmath135 where @xmath136 stand for the four nucleotides ( adenine , cytosine , thymine , guanine ) , and @xmath137 means the vacuum state , or a gap in a nucleotide sequence .",
    "the particular correspondence between nucleotides and the cyclic group @xmath138 comes from biochemical properties of four nucleotides . since @xmath139 and @xmath7 are purines and @xmath140 and @xmath141 are pyrimidines , the wave functions of @xmath139 and @xmath7 ( @xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively ) should not be very different from each other @xcite ; thus it seems reasonable to use representation providing @xmath142 , as chosen above in .",
