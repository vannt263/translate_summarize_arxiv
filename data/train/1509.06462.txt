    "the entanglement of quantum states is a correlation between multiple systems that is peculiar to quantum mechanics @xcite . the behavior of entangled quantum states",
    "is called `` quantum entanglement '' .",
    "it plays important roles in quantum computation and quantum information @xcite , and is useful in applications of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "entanglement entropy is a measure of the strength of quantum entanglement .",
    "it has been used as an order parameter of quantum spin systems @xcite .    a different method to analyze quantum entanglement using thermofield dynamics ( tfd ) @xcite was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and its applicability confirmed in ref .  @xcite . in this treatment of quantum entanglement with tfd",
    ", an extended density matrix is defined on the doubled hilbert space ( physical and ancillary hilbert spaces ) , and examined for some simple cases  @xcite .",
    "the tfd - based method allows the entanglement states to be easily understood , because the intrinsic elements caused by quantum entanglement can be extracted from the extended density matrix in this formulation .",
    "consequently , it was found that the intrinsic quantum entanglement can be distinguished from the thermal fluctuations included in the definition of ordinary quantum entanglement at finite temperatures .",
    "based on the analysis presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was argued that the general tfd formulation of the extended density matrix is applicable , not only to equilibrium states , but also to non - equilibrium states .",
    "the extended density matrix was calculated as a simple example in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of equilibrium finite - spin systems with external fields . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the extended entanglement entropy , which was obtained by using the extended density matrix , could be decomposed into parts from thermal ( but classical ) fluctuations and from quantum entanglement , as in eqs .",
    "@xmath0 . in the present communication",
    ", we prove that the value of the extended entanglement entropies of the non - equilibrium finite - spin systems is positive semi - definite .",
    "we then obtain the extended entanglement entropies of tfd as a well - defined measure of quantum entanglement .    moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors gave an example of a frustration effect on the entanglement of equilibrium finite - spin systems that is caused by competing external fields .",
    "they compared a system that does not contain a competing effect between the interaction and the external fields with one that does contain it .",
    "they concluded that this competing effect is a kind of frustration , in relation to the partial recovery of the broken symmetry of the spin inversion , by using the equilibrium density matrix .",
    "however , the entanglement entropies of non - equilibrium systems with external fields were not analyzed in refs .",
    "thus , the effect of frustration on the entanglement of non - equilibrium systems with external fields remains interesting . in the present communication ,",
    "we therefore investigate , exhaustively , the extended density matrices and entanglement entropies of non - equilibrium spin systems with both non - competing and competing external fields based on the general tfd algorithm . by comparing the quantities for the non - competing and competing cases ,",
    "we demonstrate the frustration effect on the dissipative dynamics of the entanglement through `` twin - peaks '' oscillations of the extended density matrices and the extended entanglement entropies .",
    "furthermore , the origin and the generality of the `` twin - peaks '' oscillations are argued by using the extended entanglement entropies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we introduce the extended density matrices of the non - equilibrium systems with external fields in the next section and examine their properties . in section 3 , we obtain the extended entanglement entropies of non - equilibrium spin systems with competing and non - competing external fields , and discuss the numerical results .",
    "the last section is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",

    "@xcite recognized that the two systems with hamiltonians , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , should be compared for the cases of a non - competing external field @xmath13 and competing external field @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "as can also be seen from eq .  , the spin inversion symmetry of these systems is broken by these external fields in the hamiltonian . in a forthcoming analysis exploring the frustration effect on the dissipative dynamics of entanglement",
    ", the partial recovery of this broken symmetry will play an important role .",
    "the state , @xmath15 , of the total system is defined by the direct product , @xmath16 . using the base @xmath17 , the matrix form of the hamiltonian",
    "is expressed as @xmath18 for the non - competing case and @xmath19 , of these systems is given by the dissipative von neumann equation @xcite @xmath20-\\epsilon \\left ( \\rho ^{\\alpha } ( t)-\\rho ^{\\alpha } _ { \\text{eq } } \\right),\\label{eq:2}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is a dissipation parameter , @xmath22 `` nc '' for the non - competing case or `` c '' for the competing case , and @xmath23 the ordinary density matrix of the equilibrium systems @xcite .",
