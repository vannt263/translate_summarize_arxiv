    "observations of type  ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) at high redshift has led to the astonishing deduction that the universal expansion is accelerating @xcite .",
    "a key factor in this discovery has been the painstaking calibration of the relation between the sne  ia luminosity and the behaviour of the light curves @xcite .",
    "however , the size of the effect ( about 0.25  mags ) which indicates acceleration is several times smaller than the intrinsic range of luminosity in local sne  ia _",
    "i.e. _ the correction that has to be made using the calibration relation is large . given that the calibration relation is derived empirically , and that the physics of sne  ia is only partially understood , it is therefore important to exploit every opportunity to test for intrinsic differences in the sne or in their environments between the local and high - z universe . in this letter",
    "we consider the rates , luminosities and extinction of sne  ia at @xmath8 .",
    "the current consensus on the diversity of sne  ia is that it arises primarily from the mass of @xmath10ni produced in the explosion , with a higher relative @xmath10ni producing a more luminous and more slowly declining lightcurve .",
    "close - binary evolutionary calculations @xcite of possible progenitors indicate that the c / o ratio is lower for higher mass co cores .",
    "it has been suggested , although not demonstrated , that a smaller c / o ratio in the progenitor white dwarf yields less @xmath10ni and so a lower luminosity @xcite .",
    "thus , co white dwarf progenitors arising from higher mass main - sequence stars may yield less luminous sne  ia .",
    "metallicity can have a significant effect via the white dwarf wind which affects the minimum co white dwarf mass that can accrete as far as the chandrasekhar limit @xcite .",
    "a high metallicity implies a higher white dwarf wind .",
    "this allows white dwarfs with a lower co mass to reach the chandrasekhar limit and hence produce brighter sne  ia .",
    "thus , there will be a tendency for a larger number of , and more luminous sne  ia to occur in high metallicity populations and vice versa .",
    "it is predicted that metallicity in spirals will decrease with increasing redshift @xcite .",
    "such a decrease is not expected to occur in ellipticals since they have had essentially no star formation over this look - back time .",
    "consequently we might expect that , relative to ellipticals , sne  ia in high-@xmath9 spirals should exhibit reduced luminosities and lower rates .",
    "conversely , modelling of the total sne  ia rate ( per @xmath11 @xmath12 ) with redshift predicts little change in the total sne  ia rate with increasing redshift up to @xmath13 @xcite . this prediction has been shown to be true up to at least @xmath14 by independent observations @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite also model the variation in sne  ia rate with redshift for host galaxies of different morphological types , and find that significant changes are anticipated only beyond z@xmath151.6 . at lower redshifts ,",
    "the absolute and relative rates are predicted to remain roughly the same as the local values for spirals and ellipticals .",
    "another important issue in current studies of high-@xmath9 sne  ia is that of extinction . both supernova search teams correct for galactic extinction but find that very few of their supernovae show a residual colour excess , implying negligible extinction in the host galaxies .",
    "no significant extinction is found in 14 out of 16 sne  ia discovered by @xcite and in 40 out of 42 sne  ia discovered by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also argue against the presence of neutral extinction .",
    "they point out that the observed dispersion in mlcs - derived distances is substantially smaller than would be expected if grey dust extinction were the main cause of the lower brightness of high-@xmath9 sne  ia .",
    "however , @xcite has highlighted inconsistencies in the treatment of host galaxy extinctions between the two sne  ia search teams .",
    "moreover , @xcite has shown that by employing a consistent treatment of extinction and excluding those sne  ia observed only after maximum light , a positive @xmath16 is only required at the @xmath17 level .",
    "the apparent lack of host galaxy extinction is , perhaps , surprising for two reasons .",
    "firstly , local sne  ia are observed with a range of host galaxy extinctions spanning @xmath18 , with most lying in the range @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "secondly , the increasing gas content in galaxies with increasing redshift means that , contrary to the findings of the sn search teams , we might expect mean extinction levels to _ increase _ with redshift due to increased dust opacities caused by the higher gas column densities @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible that the apparent lack of extinction at high - z is due to observational bias .",
    "sne  ia behind a dust screen will be fainter , and thus would be selected against in searches near the magnitude limit .",
    "in addition , follow - up spectroscopy favours those sne  ia that are a large distance from the host galaxy centres in order to minimise contamination from host galaxy light .",
    "these sne  ia may be expected to have less extinction than those found near the host galaxy centres .",
    ".high redshift type ia supernovae host galaxies [ sne1ahosts ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     j2000 coordinates are quoted .",
    "peak b band magnitudes , given in the rest - frame of the supernova , are taken from @xcite and include corrections using the stretch - factor method .",
    "sn1997eq is present in both the @xcite sample and our sample in table [ sne1ahosts ] .",
    "the final f814w host galaxy images are presented in figure [ sn_images ] and morphological classifications are given in table [ sne1ahosts ] .",
    "spectra for several of the supernovae in our sample have been published @xcite , although no spectra of the host galaxies themselves have been published .",
    "where possible we have used the contamination from host galaxy light in the published sne  ia spectra to refine the morphological classifications further .",
    "we note however that classification of host galaxy type based on the observed morphology only is still robust in distinguishing between elliptical and spiral systems . however , the images on their own are insufficiently detailed to be used to divide the spiral systems into subtypes ( e.g. sbc , sbbc etc . ) .",
    "the sample exhibits morphologies ranging from pure ellipticals ( e.g. the hosts of sn  1997cj , sn  2000ec ) to systems with clear signs of spiral structure ( the hosts of sn  1997ce , sn  1997ek , sn  1998bi ) .",
    "the host galaxy of sn  1997es appears to be disturbed .",
    "overall , four hosts have a morphology consistent with an e / s0 classification , while the remaining eleven either exhibit spiral structure or are disturbed . a wide range of sn distances from the galaxy centres is also found , ranging from @xmath0kpc ( sn  1997es , sn  2000ee ) to @xmath1kpc ( sn  1998 m .",
    "note that the object directly above the supernova is a foreground galaxy . )",
    "the projected distances are presented in table [ sne1ahosts ] .",
    "the colour maps for the host galaxies of sn  2000ea and sn  2000eg are presented in figure [ sn_colmaps ] .",
    "sky background regions in both maps have been masked out . in the rest frame of the galaxies",
    ", the colour corresponds closely to @xmath20 .",
    "we note that , owing to the way in which the maps were constructed , they can not be used to accurately measure the supernova colours .",
    "large - scale , irregular colour variation of order @xmath21 is seen across both galaxies , with extreme differences as high as @xmath22 .",
    "to improve the statistics we added seven more sne  ia host galaxies at a similar redshift , imaged by @xcite using stis on hst .",
    "these galaxies are presented in table [ ellishosts ] .",
    "two of these are classified as e / s0 and five as spirals .",
    "an eighth galaxy from @xcite , the host of sn  1997eq , is common to both samples .",
    "we agree with @xcite that it is a spiral type .",
    "thus , for a combined sample of 22 sne  ia host galaxies , @xmath23 are e / s0 systems and @xmath24 are spirals or disturbed systems .",
    "these proportions are similar to that observed locally by @xcite .",
    "these authors also find a ratio of about @xmath23 to @xmath24 when their results are expressed as sn rate per unit bolometric luminosity of the host galaxy .",
    "adopting the same conversion between sne  ia counts per galaxy type and sne  ia rates per unit galaxy luminosity as @xcite , we infer that the relative sne  ia rate in spirals and ellipticals has not changed between @xmath8 and the local universe .",
    "this is consistent with the prediction of @xcite that the relative rates should be unchanged in going from z=0.6 to the local universe .",
    "peak rest - frame b band magnitudes for the sne in our sample have so far been published for only two objects @xcite ; sn 1997ce ( @xmath5=19.26 ) and sn 1997cj ( 19.25 ) .",
    "these are the magnitudes obtained following application of mlcs correction .",
    "however , stretch - factor - corrected b band peak magnitudes for 7 out of the 8 host galaxies presented in @xcite have been published in @xcite .",
    "these magnitudes are listed in table [ ellishosts ] .",
    "the total of 9 sne  ia comprises 3 in ellipticals and 6 in spirals .",
    "although the two teams observe their supernovae using different filter sets , the light curve fitting methods employed by both teams give stretch factor corrected magnitudes in the same filter , namely b band in the rest - frame of the supernovae .",
    "we thus intercompare published magnitudes from both teams .",
    "the mean peak b  band magnitude for the sne  ia in the 6 spiral systems is @xmath25 .",
    "for the 3 sne  ia in elliptical systems the mean peak b  band magnitude is @xmath26 .",
    "thus , we find no significant difference in the average light - curve - shape - corrected @xmath5 for high - z sne  ia between spirals and ellipticals .",
    "we thus find that light - curve shape correction methods @xcite appear to be valid for sne  ia at @xmath8 in all host galaxy types .",
    "the irregular colour structure in two of the host galaxies ( figure [ sn_colmaps ] ) is most plausibly interpreted as being due to variation in a significant dust extinction ( this also supports their classification as spirals ) .",
    "we also note that simulations of host galaxy extinctions and radial distributions of supernovae @xcite have shown that sne  ia within @xmath27kpc of the centres of spiral galaxies will be observationally dimmer and have a larger magnitude dispersion than sne  ia in the outer regions , although part of the observed dispersion will probably be due to projection effects .",
    "inspection of figure [ sn_images ] shows that the sne  ia are found over a range of projected distances from the host galaxy centre .",
    "these distances are listed in table [ sne1ahosts ] .",
    "it is possible that the real distances from the host galaxy centres are in fact all @xmath7kpc and that the observed distances are simply due to projection effects , however we argue against this for two reasons .",
    "firstly , 10 out of the 15 sne in our sample have projected distances from the host galaxy nuclei of @xmath28kpc , which argues against a distribution in a shell of @xmath7kpc in radius .",
    "secondly , the distances from galaxy centres for local sne  ia range from @xmath29kpc to @xmath1kpc , and there is no compelling physical reason why the distribution of galactocentric distances of sne  ia at z=0.6 should differ from the distribution observed locally .",
    "overall , our results are consistent with a similar range of real separations of sne  ia from the centres of their host galaxies as is observed locally .",
    "we find no evidence to suggest that sne  ia at @xmath8 are found preferentially far out in the host galaxies where extinction levels might be expected to be small .",
    "moreover , current observational and theoretical evidence does not favour any significant changes in typical galaxy size at @xmath8 relative to that observed locally @xcite .",
    "consequently we can also state that there is no difference in the distribution with galaxy scalelength between local sne  ia and those at @xmath8 .",
    "we are led to suspect that a significant fraction of the 22 events may be subject to some extinction . given that dustier environments at higher redshifts are also to be expected @xcite , the general lack of extinction found in high-@xmath9 sne  ia discovered by @xcite and @xcite remains puzzling .",
    "we do however note the following two caveats .",
    "firstly , the possibility of some observational bias ( _ cf .",
    "_ section 1 ) operating within a region closer than @xmath1510  kpc is not ruled out .",
    "secondly , details about the sne  ia in our two `` dusty '' spirals ( figure [ sn_colmaps ] ) have yet to be published , and so we are unable to comment directly on the degree of extinction that these events might have encountered .    in summary , we find that , at @xmath8 , the observed relative rates and relative luminosities of type ia supernovae in elliptical and spiral galaxies are consistent with predictions based on the locally - derived understanding of sne  ia physics and the influence of progenitor mass and metallicity @xcite .",
    "we find no reason to question this understanding .",
    "unless some level of observational bias is present , there is however still some difficulty with the apparently low observed extinction towards sne  ia at high - z .",
