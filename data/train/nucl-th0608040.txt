    "the transition region between nucleon - meson ( hadronic ) and quark - gluon ( partonic ) degrees of freedom is a topic of longstanding interest in nuclear physics . a promising observable to map this transition is the transparency of the nuclear medium to the propagation of hadrons . in @xmath0 experiments ,",
    "the nuclear transparency is defined as the ratio of the cross section per nucleon to the hydrogen one .",
    "accordingly , the nuclear transparency is a measure for the attenuation effects of the spectator nucleons on the impinging and outgoing protons .    in the conventional glauber picture @xcite , the nuclear transparency extracted from @xmath0 reactions",
    "is predicted to be rather constant for incoming momentum larger than a few gev / c . the color transparency ( ct ) phenomenon suggests an anomalously large transmission probability of protons through nuclei @xcite and leads to a nuclear transparency that increases with incoming momentum .",
    "the experimental @xmath0 data @xcite suggest a ct - like increase in the transparency for impinging proton momenta between @xmath1 and @xmath2  gev / c . for higher momenta",
    "the nuclear transparency falls back to the glauber level .",
    "this oscillatory energy dependence is not unique to the @xmath0 nuclear transparency : it has been observed or hinted at in @xmath3 elastic scattering @xcite , elastic @xmath4 fixed - angle scattering @xcite , pion photoproduction @xcite , and deuteron photodisintegration @xcite .",
    "one possible interpretation of this energy dependence of the @xmath0 transparency is provided by the presence of two terms in the free @xmath3 scattering amplitude @xcite .",
    "ralston and pire @xcite suggested a combination of the following two components .",
    "first , the quark - counting component which follows the dimensional scaling law @xcite and represents a small object ( a point - like configuration , plc ) .",
    "second , the landshoff component @xcite which is associated with normal - sized configurations .",
    "the interference between these two amplitudes induces the oscillation of the @xmath3 cross section about the scaling behavior .",
    "inside the nuclear medium , the landshoff component will be suppressed because of the strong interactions with the spectator nucleons , while the quark - counting component will escape the nucleus with relatively small attenuation due to ct .",
    "this phenomenon is called `` nuclear filtering '' ( nf ) @xcite : the nucleus filters away the normal - sized components in the hadron wave functions . accordingly",
    ", the nucleus plays an active role in selecting small - sized components .",
    "the nf model is able to reproduce qualitatively the observed bump in the @xmath0 transparency .",
    "recently , a relativistic and cross - section factorized framework for @xmath0 reactions has been proposed @xcite . in this letter , this formalism is extended to incorporate the ralston - pire model for the @xmath3 scattering amplitude and the concepts of ct and nf . for the description of the initial- and final - state interactions ( ifsi ) of the impinging and two outgoing protons , we adopt the relativistic multiple - scattering glauber approximation ( rmsga ) @xcite .",
    "this relativistic extension of the glauber model , which was originally developed to describe @xmath5 observables @xcite , models the ifsi as consecutive cumulative scatterings with the individual spectator nucleons in the nucleus . to compute the effects of ct , we consider the quantum diffusion model of ref .",

    "further , we describe two different methods to deal with ct , thereby indicating the similarities and differences .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents the nuclear transparency results for the target nuclei , , , and .",
    "the effect of ifsi , ct and nf is discussed .",
    "furthermore , the accuracy of the approximated rmsga approach is investigated and the two ct treatments are compared .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : concl ] summarizes our findings and states our conclusions .",
    "in the ralston - pire approach @xcite , the spin - averaged @xmath3 scattering amplitude consists of the quark - counting ( qc ) and the landshoff ( l ) contribution : @xmath6 the @xmath7 term results in a differential cross section that scales like @xmath8 and the landshoff term can be related to it through @xmath9 here , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the mandelstam variables .",

    "the sole parameter which remains undetermined is the sign of the phase difference @xmath16 between the quark - counting and the landshoff term .",
    "therefore , both signs will be used in the calculations .    incorporating the ralston - pire approach and the nf mechanism into the @xmath0 formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite , the amplitude for the @xmath17 reaction becomes @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the missing momentum and @xmath20 refers to the state wherein the struck proton resided . in this expression , the effect of ifsi is accounted for through the distorted momentum - space wave functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "since the quark - counting term is associated with plcs , the corresponding momentum - space wave function @xmath23 includes the effect of ct .",
    "the landshoff term , on the other hand , corresponds with a hadron of normal size .",
    "consequently , the ifsi can be computed in standard glauber theory .",

    "ralston and pire @xcite , on the other hand , do succeed in reproducing the maxima and minima in the nuclear transparency data .",

    "another effect that can be studied in figs .",
    "[ fig : trans.12c.flfsvsjm ] and [ fig : trans.27al.flfsvsjm ] is the influence of the sign of @xmath104 on the rmsga+ct+nf results . for the flfs model of ct ,",
    "the differences between calculations using both signs of @xmath105 are minor .",
    "as already observed by jennings and miller @xcite , the results using the jm model of ct are rather sensitive to this sign .",
    "the discrepancy between the flfs- and jm - based calculations arises from the different structure of the effective cross sections ( [ eq : flfs_eff_sigma ] ) and ( [ eq : jm_eff_sigma ] ) .",
    "these effective cross sections not only determine the attenuation of the quark - counting term in the nuclear medium , but also the phase difference between the quark - counting and the landshoff term . whereas the real parts of both effective cross sections are quite similar , the flfs effective cross section ( [ eq : flfs_eff_sigma ] ) is purely real , while its jm counterpart also has an imaginary part .",
    "this imaginary part causes the enhanced sensitivity of the jm results to the sign of @xmath106 . as for which sign causes the best agreement with the data , no firm conclusions can be drawn . indeed , the optimum choice for the sign of @xmath105 depends on the used ct model ( flfs or jm ) , the value of the parameter @xmath66 or @xmath71 , and the target nucleus . for the @xmath84 reaction , the positive sign provides the best agreement , while the transparency data rather require a negative sign .",
    "the @xmath50 dependence of the nuclear transparency at two values of the incoming momentum @xmath85 is studied in fig .  [",
    "fig : trans.adep ] .",
    "the standard rmsga calculations fall considerably below the data .",
    "further , none of the rmsga+ct+nf calculations succeed in simultaneously describing the data for all target nuclei . while the flfs approach agrees with the and data points rather well using @xmath107(gev",
    "/ c@xmath68)@xmath68 , the flfs results tend to underestimate the and data . with regard to the @xmath71 parameter of the jm model , for the and nuclei a value of @xmath100  mev seems acceptable , whereas the heavier and nuclei need a smaller @xmath71 value .",
    "a general feature of the rmsga+ct+nf predictions is that their @xmath50 dependence is steeper than the data .",
    "finally , the dot - dashed and dotted curves indicate that the @xmath101  gev / c data are proportional to @xmath108 , while at @xmath2  gev / c the @xmath50 dependence of the data is more gradual ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "this trend is not reproduced by the standard rmsga predictions , which are almost independent of the incoming momentum .",
    "when ct and nf effects are included , the softening of the @xmath50 dependence with increasing incoming momentum is also present in the calculations .",
    "for example , the flfs calculations with @xmath107(gev / c@xmath68)@xmath68 correspond to @xmath110 at @xmath101  gev / c incoming momentum and @xmath111 at @xmath2  gev / c .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a relativistic framework to calculate the nuclear transparency for @xmath0 processes .",
    "a relativistic multiple - scattering glauber model was used to account for the ifsi . to reduce the computational cost of the rmsga calculations , some additional approximations were made .",
    "the predictions with the full and the approximated rmsga approach agree at the few percent level .",
    "thus , to determine integrated quantities such as the nuclear transparency , a valid alternative for the computationally intensive rmsga framework is available .    using the concept of nuclear filtering , our calculations are in qualitative agreement with the data , thereby confirming earlier calculations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our calculations seem to indicate that ct is imperative to increase the calculations to the level of the data .",
    "the same conclusion was reported in refs .",
    "@xcite . the quantitative description of the data , however , is far from perfect and it is not possible to constrain the magnitude of the parameters in the ct models .",
    "the indications for ct in @xmath0 reactions are not necessarily in contradiction with the results from @xmath5 experiments .",
    "although the @xmath5 transparencies show no significant increase with the four - momentum transfer @xmath112 @xcite and can be reasonably reproduced in the rmsga framework , the existence of ct can not be excluded since the predicted effect is small @xcite .",
    "this is caused by the small expansion times of the plc to normal size at the present @xmath5 kinematics .",
    "the effect of ct is more pronounced in the @xmath0 transparency for different reasons .",
    "first , in the @xmath0 reaction there are three particles that can experience ct instead of only one in @xmath5 reactions .",
    "second , @xmath0 data are available up to @xmath113 values of @xmath83  ( gev / c)@xmath68 , while @xmath5 transparency experiments are restricted to @xmath114  ( gev / c)@xmath68 .    a number of uncertainties involving the @xmath0 transparency remain .",
    "one subject of discussion is the size of the landshoff term . according to botts et al .",
    "@xcite , this term might also be small - sized .",
    "this would make the survival probability of the landshoff and the quark - counting term rather similar and would weaken the oscillations in the energy dependence of the computed transparencies . apart from the ralston - pire picture discussed above , other explanations of the energy dependence of the transparency have been suggested .",
    "for example , brodsky and de teramond @xcite interpreted the oscillatory behavior in terms of two broad baryon resonances associated with strange and charmed particle production thresholds , interfering with a perturbative qcd background .",
    "an improved set of data , particularly at higher energies , is essential to clarify these issues .",
    "the @xmath115  gev proton synchrotron that is under construction at j - parc @xcite opens great opportunities for this research .",
