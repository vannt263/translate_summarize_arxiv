    "femtoscopic bose - einstein correlations , also known as hbt / gglp effect , were investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite by cms for pp collisions at @xmath40.9  tev @xcite , 2.36  tev @xcite and 7  tev @xcite .",
    "such phenomenon was discovered by goldhaber , s. goldhaber , w. lee and a. pais ( gglp effect ) @xcite , being the analogous in high - energy collisions to a similar method proposed by r. hanbury - brown and r. q. twiss ( hbt effect ) @xcite for estimating angular dimensions of stars .",
    "a broad investigation was carried out in these studies in terms of the invariant relative momenum @xmath5 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , similarly to what was previously observed in @xmath6 collisions @xcite , an anticorrelation was reported .",
    "this result required a study of different fitting functions , as had been suggested in the case of small systems , such as the @xmath7 model @xcite , which considers strong correlations between the space - time coordinates and the momentum components of the emitted particles , and was found to describe better the overall behavior of the correlation functions .",
    "a natural extension of those analyses is to investigate the gglp / hbt correlations with respect to different components of the pair relative momentum , which allows for exploring the source sizes in different directions .",
    "such analyses have also been studies by other experiments at rhic and lhc  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the hbt / gglp correlation is measured in two - dimensions ( 2-d ) as a function of the relative momenta along and transverse to the beam direction , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . in three - dimensions ( 3-d )",
    "the bose - einstein correlations are studied in terms of @xmath8 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , these last two obtained , respectively , by projecting the transverse component @xmath12 in orthogonal directions , i.e. , parallel to the average transverse momentum of the pair ( @xmath1 ) , and orthogonal to both @xmath8 and @xmath10 .    using the same framework as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the hbt / gglp effect is further scrutinised here for charged hadrons produced in minimum bias events in pp collisions at @xmath13 and 7  tev with the data collected by cms at the cern lhc .",
    "new 1-d results at both these energies are discussed and then the analysis is extended to 2-d and 3-d cases .",
    "the data sets used in this analysis correspond to minimum bias samples obtained in pp collisions at 2.76 and 7  tev recorded with the cms detector at the lhc @xcite . a detailed description of the cms detector can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . the minimum bias sample at @xmath14 2.76  tev was triggered on - line by requiring at least one track with @xmath15  gev to be found in the pixel tracker with @xmath16 for a pp bunch crossing .",
    "besides , in the offline analysis hadronic collisions were selected by requiring a coincidence of at least one forward hadronic ( hf ) calorimeter tower with more than 3  gev of total energy in each of the hf detectors . in the case of pp collisions at 7  tev events were selected by a trigger signal in each side of the beam scintillation counter ( bsc ) , coincident with a signal from either of the two detectors indicating the presence of at least one proton bunch crossing the interaction point ( ip ) .",
    "collision events were then selected offline by requiring a beam pickup for timing for the experiments ( bptx ) signal from both beams passing the ip .    the set of pp collision events at @xmath13  tev used in this analysis comprises the data collected by cms in 2013 at the cern lhc ( 3.4 million events ) .",
    "at @xmath17  tev , a combined sample from pp collisions was considered , which uses data from three periods of the cms data taking , i.e. , commissioning run ( 23 million events ) , as well as from the runs 2010a ( 16 million events ) and run 2010b ( 4 million events ) , where the first is almost pileup free , while the later has a non - negligible fraction of events with multiple interactions .",
    "a filter was used for reducing the contamination in case of multiple vertices ( the reconstructed vertex with the largest number of associated tracks is selected at 7  tev , while in pp collisions at 2.76  tev , an additional primary vertex might be identified as originating from a second pp collision by looking at its properties ) . to assess the related systematic uncertainty , an alternative event selection for reducing pileup contamination was also investigated by considering only single reconstructed vertex events .    in the case of pp collisions at 2.76  tev",
    ", three monte carlo samples were used . for obtaining the bec results , minimum bias events simulated with pythia",
    "6 z2 tune @xcite were employed , whereas pythia d6 t and pythia z2star @xcite were used for estimating the systematic uncertainties related to the choice of monte carlo tune .",
    "each of them contained 2 million events .",
    "for the analysis at 7  tev about 33 million monte carlo events were simulated using pythia 6 z2 tune .",
    "the track selection employed in both cases above follows the same criteria as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and are discussed in details in these references , as well as in @xcite .",
    "the procedure adopted is the same as described in refs .",
    "although no particle identification is considered in this analysis , the contamination from non - pions is not expected to be sizeable , as discussed in @xcite , since pions are the dominant type of hadrons in the sample . for each event ,",
    "the signal containing the bose - einstein correlations is identified by pairing same charge tracks from the same event and distributing them in bins of the relative momentum of the pair , for instance , @xmath18 , being @xmath19 the four - momenta of the individual particles in the pair .",
    "the background distribution or reference sample is formed similarly , by pairing charged particles from different events and within the same @xmath20 range ( where the full pseudorapidity interval is divided in three subranges @xmath21 , corresponding to @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 ) , as in ref .",
    "this mixed event technique is referred to as `` same track density in @xmath21 '' . a single ratio is then formed , having the signal pair distribution as numerator and the reference sample as denominator , with the appropriate normalization , i.e. , @xmath25 the invariant relative momentum of the pair is defined as @xmath26 ; @xmath27 is the integral of the signal pair distribution of all the events , whereas @xmath28 is the equivalent in the reference sample . a double ratio technique",
    "is then taken with the data and the monte carlo single ratios corresponding to the @xmath29 distributions , in terms of which the bose - einstein correlation ( bec ) effect is investigated @xcite , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the single ratio computed with the simulated events generated without bec . in each case , the reference samples for data and simulation are obtained in the same way .",
    "this double - ratio procedure has the advantage of considerably reducing the sources of bias due to track inefficiency and other detector - related effects , as well as other bose - einstein correlations .",
    "the gglp / hbt method reflects not only the quantum statistics of the pair of identical particles , but is also sensitive to the underlying dynamics . in particular , in the case of charged hadrons , the correlation function may be distorted by strong , as well as by coulomb interactions . for pions , the strong interactions can usually be neglected in femtoscopic measurements . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the depletion ( enhancement ) in the correlation function caused by the coulomb repulsion ( attraction ) of equal ( opposite ) charge pairs in the case of pions is corrected by weighting pair - wise with the inverse gamow factor  @xcite .",
    "this factor , in case of same charge and opposite charge , is given by @xmath32 with @xmath33 , where @xmath34 the pion mass and @xmath29 the invariant relative momentum of the pair .",
    "for performing the multidimensional analysis , the double ratios are investigated in terms of the projections of the relative momentum @xmath35 in two or three directions . in the 2-d case ,",
    "the decomposition is made in @xmath36 ( _ longitudinal _ component , along the beam direction ) , and @xmath37 ( _ transverse _ component ) . in the 3-d case ,",
    "additional projections are considered in the transverse plane , resulting in @xmath10 ( _ outwards _ ) , and @xmath11 ( _ sidewards _ ) , respectively along the average transverse momentum of the pair , @xmath38 , and orthogonal to it ; @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath8 are mutually orthogonal .",
    "this decomposition of the relative momentum of the pair is also known as bertsch - pratt variables @xcite .",
    "the investigations are carried out in center - of - mass ( cm ) , i.e. , the lhc laboratory frame , as well as in the local co - moving system ( lcms ) , characterized by the frame in which the longitudinal component of the pair average momentum ( @xmath39 ) is zero .",
    "details about the 2-d and 3-d relative momentum projections , as well as the boost to the lcms can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the parameterizations used to fit the correlation functions in one- ( 1-d ) , two- ( 2-d ) and three - dimensions ( 3-d ) , respectively in terms of @xmath29 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , are listed below . throughout this analysis @xmath42",

    "the exponent @xmath49 is the lvy index of stability satisfying the inequality @xmath50 . in all the above cases ,",
    "if treated as a free parameter when fitting the double ratios , this exponent usually results into a number between the value characterizing the exponential ( @xmath51 ) and the gaussian ( @xmath52 ) functions .",
    "more details can be found in ref .",
    "for the sake of clarity , we denote the longitudinal component of the relative momentum in the cm frame as @xmath8 , and in the lcms , as @xmath53 .",

    "the additional polinomial terms are introduced for accommodating possible deviations of the baseline from unity at large values of these variables ( long - range correlations ) , as well as for allowing a better quality fit . in the 2-d and 3-d cases",

    "however , when the analysis is performed in the lcms , this cross - term does not contribute for sources symmetric along the longitudinal direction .",
    "various sources of systematical uncertainties were considered in this analysis , as listed in table  [ tab:1d - syst - summary ] , the first four being similar to what was discussed in ref .",
    "two additional studies were also performed : the effect of separating positive from negative charges in the single ratios ( since @xmath72 , as well as @xmath73 charges are added in the signal ; in the reference sample , besides these two combinations , the @xmath74 case is also added to the sample ) .",
