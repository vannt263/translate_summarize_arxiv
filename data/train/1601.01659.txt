    "since the discovery of cuprate high temperature superconductors ( htsc)@xcite in 1986 there has been an extraordinary theoretical effort to explain the nature of their microscopic behavior as they are not completely described by the bcs theory @xcite . however , very few of these theories consider comparison with specific heat data ( or other thermodynamic properties ) .",
    "the htsc cuprates were the most frequently studied both experimentally and theoretically until fe based superconductors showed up @xcite .",
    "more recently , the appearance of h@xmath0s at high pressures @xcite beat down the record of higher @xmath1 held by the cuprates .",
    "but , as can be seen in the many publications related to these newer materials ( fe - based and h@xmath0s ) , the scenario has become even more entangled .",
    "high @xmath1 cuprate superconductors have peculiarities which represent a benchmark in our current understanding of superconductivity .",
    "it is widely accepted that the cooper pairs , which are responsible for the superconductivity , move in the copper oxide planes resembling a quasi-2d layered system @xcite , and have coherence lengths much smaller than those in conventional superconductors .",
    "the phase diagram @xcite of the yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath9 shows a dome in the superconducting temperature as a function of the oxygen content @xmath10 , either by introducing electrons or holes , giving the latter ones the higher temperatures .",
    "cooper pairs are pre - formed at a particular temperature @xmath11 ( pseudogap temperature ) above the superconducting dome in the underdoped region @xcite ( where @xmath1 is smaller than the higher @xmath1 possible ) , and they undergo a bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) as temperature is lowered @xcite .",
    "there are many other characteristics , but of special interest to us are some recently reported experimental results : the modification of the size of the lattice with oxygen doping @xcite ; the notorious increase of the superconducting gap magnitude @xcite and the dramatic drop of the fermi temperature @xmath12 when doping is diminished @xcite .",
    "these features are of crucial importance in our results .",
    "experiments , reveal four key characteristics of specific heat as a function of temperature : a linear term @xmath13 in the electronic component , which is believed to come from the normal state electronic specific heat @xmath14 above @xmath1 ( see ref .",
    "[ ] and references therein ) , and its superconducting counterpart that evolves as @xmath15 when the temperature approaches zero .",
    "secondly , there is a quadratic @xmath6 term for zero magnetic field @xcite below @xmath1 ( not exhibited in conventional superconductors ) , which changes to a @xmath16 component in the presence of an external magnetic field @xcite @xmath17 , attributable to the superconducting part of the electronic specific heat @xmath18 .",
    "the reported values for this two constants depend strongly on the conditions of each experiment @xcite and on the theoretical method used to relate the different parts of the total specific heat .",
    "thirdly , there is a `` jump '' in the constant pressure specific heat @xcite @xmath19 at @xmath1 ( at zero magnetic field and evolving into a `` peak '' at finite magnetic field ) , @xmath20 , attributable to the @xmath18 component , indicating a second order phase transition which in turn becomes a smooth maximum as doping decreases @xcite . finally , as the `` upturn '' in the specific heat at very low temperatures",
    "is suppressed , a cubic term @xmath8 is also observed @xcite .",
    "the lattice specific heat @xmath21 of a cuprate , which is generally considered as not changing with the onset of superconductivity @xcite , turns out to give a crucial contribution to the total specific heat .",
    "although a series of indirect methods have been used to extract the electronic component of the total specific heat @xcite , we use the phonon density of states ( pdos ) directly derived from angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments to calculate the lattice specific heat as shown in refs .",
    "[ ] and [ ] .",
    "we obtain that the electronic specific heat contributes less than @xmath22 to the total .    in the framework of the most basic boson - fermion model of superconductivity @xcite",
    ", we assume that cooper pairs are composite - spin - zero - bosons with either zero or nonzero center - of - mass momenta ( cmm ) , coexisting with a fermion fluid of the unpaired electrons . to include the effect of the layered structure of cuprates in the boson - fermion model",
    ", we calculate the bec critical temperature and the thermodynamic properties for a system of non - interacting bosons immersed in a periodic multilayer array @xcite , simulated by an external dirac comb potential along the perpendicular direction of the cuo@xmath0 planes , while the cooper pairs are allowed to move freely within the planes , with a linear energy - momentum dispersion relation @xcite .",
    "the fermion counterpart is treated in a similar way @xcite as the boson gas , subject to the same external potential . in this model , we assume that only a small fraction @xmath23 of the initial @xmath24 fermions available for pairing participate in the superconductivity at temperature @xmath25 and below , where the number of preformed pairs is large enough to achieve coherence independently of the mechanism by which the pairs are formed . this latter assumption is based on the analysis of uemura s plot ( fig . 2 of ref [ ] )",
    "that shows that critical temperatures for cuprates are in the empirical range @xcite of @xmath26 .",
    "however , we are aware that the number of pairs could increase as the temperature is lowered below @xmath1 , but not so much as to drastically modify the final results . at this stage",
    "we assume that the number of pairs remains constant .",

    "[ the system ] we lay out the model from which we derive all the thermodynamic properties for the mixture of composite - boson gas coexisting but non - interacting with the unpaired fermion gas immersed in the layered system .",

    "furthermore , we combine @xmath34 to show that the total electronic specific heat coincides with the experimental results @xcite . our electronic specific heat constants , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are found to be of the same order of magnitude as the experimental values @xcite .",

    "while most procedures take the experimental curves of the total specific heat and subtract components , we qualitatively and quantitatively construct the total constant pressure specific heat for the yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath9 underdoped cuprates from a simple , first principles model : the boson - fermion theory of superconductivity applied to layered systems .",
    "the model assumes the cooper pairs as a composite - boson gas coexisting with an unpaired electrons ( or holes ) fermion gas .",
    "both gases are constrained in a stacked slabs structure modeled by a dirac comb potential in the perpendicular direction to the cuo@xmath2 planes .",
    "although no residual interactions among cooper pairs and unpaired fermions are considered , the model reproduces qualitatively and quantitatively the experimental curves of the electronic part and the total specific heat .    for a specific underdoped cuprate",
    "we take the cuo@xmath0 plane separation as our @xmath122 constant . in addition",
    ", we use the experimental critical temperature and the electronic specific heat jump to set our phenomenological parameters : the planes impenetrability @xmath156 and the fraction @xmath23 of fermions that turn into cooper pairs .",
    "the total specific heat is calculated by adding the specific heats coming from the composite - bosons ( superconducting electronic specific heat ) , unpaired fermions ( normal electronic specific heat ) and the lattice calculated from the arpes pdos .",
    "the resulting curves for yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 are compared to the experimental results , giving a remarkable agreement within a @xmath238 error range for temperatures below @xmath1 .",
    "we derive the linear dependence on temperature @xmath239 and the quadratic one @xmath6 for the electronic specific heat , obtaining @xmath240 mj / mol k@xmath152 and @xmath180 mj / mol k@xmath181 for @xmath241 , in agreement with the experimental data reported for similar cuprates , which is an additional check of consistency for our model .",
    "we show that the correspondence relating the normal electronic specific heat with the unpaired fermions , and the superconducting term with the cooper pairs , is a valid assumption .",
    "these results make plausible the assumption that not all pairable fermions in the fermi sea are paired , even at temperatures near zero , and that the jump in the specific heat is a direct consequence of the condensation of the pairs .",
    "we also confirm that the lattice specific heat from the phonon density of states by arpes measurements is better than that obtained from ins experiments .",
    "it can also be seen that the calculated total specific heat shows the same temperature cubic behavior for @xmath217 5 k as shown experimentally , with a coefficient @xmath40 = 0.362 mj / mol k@xmath218 .",
    "additionally , we find that the electronic specific heat ( normal plus superconducting ) has a contribution @xmath242 of the total at the transition temperature . finally , another direct outcome is the reproduction of the high mass anisotropy of the cuprates , giving @xmath28 = 12.3 for the compound analyzed .",
