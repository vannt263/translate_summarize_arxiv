    "the present situation around @xmath0 oscillation initiated by super - kamiokande hereafter , sk , simply is to be described as follows if we follow majority opinion : + ( 1 ) sk found anomaly in the atmospheric neutrinos ( muon deficit )  @xcite , + ( 2 ) sk found anomaly in the zenith angle distribution  @xcite , + ( 3 ) sk discovered atmospheric neutrino oscillation  @xcite , + ( 4 ) soudan 2 and macro confirmed sk results  @xcite , + ( 5 ) k2k confirmed atmospheric neutrino results based on the baseline experiment  @xcite , + ( 6 ) sk found oscillations themselves directly  @xcite , + ( 7 ) minos begins precise experiment and confirmed sk results  @xcite . +",
    "as one fully understand from the history on @xmath0 oscillation on atmospheric neutrinos , it is said that the experimental results by sk play decisively important role in @xmath1 oscillation .",
    "therefore , to reach the final conclusions on @xmath0 oscillation by sk , it is more desirable that careful examination on the sk conclusion is performed by the minority opinion .",
    "we have been performing computer numerical experiments to re - examine the atmospheric neutrino experiment results , constructing the virtual super - kamiokande apparatus in the computer and analyzing the virtual neutrino events produced both inside and outside the detector . in principle",
    ", we could obtain any physical events which sk obtain and , therefore , could compare our results with sk results directly , which may lead less ambiguous discussion around the atmospheric neutrino oscillation problems .    in the discussion on the atmospheric neutrino oscillation , there are two fundamental issues to be clarified from the experimental point of view , namely , the discrimination of the neutrino events ( electron events or muon events ) and the differences between the directions of the incident neutrinos and those of the produced leptons .",
    "sk treats two different types of the neutrino events as for the points of their occurrence with regard to the detector .",
    "ones are the neutrino events occurring inside the detector , namely , _",
    "fully contained events _ and _ partially contained events _ in the sk terminology and the others are neutrino events occurring outside the detector , namely , _",
    "upward through going muon events _ and _ stopping muon events _ in their terminology .",
    "the mutual relation between two fundamental issues mentioned above and different types of the neutrino events is as follows : in the neutrino events occurring inside the detector , one should be careful for the discrimination between muon neutrino events and electron neutrino events , because muon neutrino events produce the different cherenkov light patterns from those of electron neutrino events inside the detector .",
    "furthermore , one should be very sensitive to the differences between the directions of the incident neutrinos and those of the emitted leptons ( muons or electrons ) , because their scattering angles could not be neglected due to their smaller energies .",
    "on the other hand , in the neutrino events occurring outside the detector , one need not worry about the both discrimination among the neutrino events and scattering angles of the neutrino events , because these events should be identified as the muon events due to their larger effective volume and the scattering angle of the produced leptons concerned could be neglected due to their higher energies .    in the present paper",
    ", we analyze the neutrino events occurring outside the detector .",
    "the reason why we carry out the analysis of _ upward through going muon events _ and _ stopping muon events _ is that this analysis is more simpler and easier than that of the _ fully contained events _ and _ partially contained events_. our analysis of the neutrino events occurring inside the detector will be presented as a series of the papers elsewhere .",
    "our fundamental approach to examine the experimental results obtained by sk is to carry out `` re - experiment '' of sk . for the purpose",
    ", we have constructed the virtual sk detector in the computer and analyze virtual `` experimental '' events produced in the virtual detector .",
    "the characteristics of our computer numerical experiment are that we could obtain any physical results which sk obtain and we could examine sk results more concretely , comparing sk results with our results directly .    here , we give the algorithm for our computer numerical experiment . in figure [ fig:01 ] , we show the concept of our numerical computer experiment schematically .",
    "the procedure of our numerical experiment is as follows : we start a neutrino with some energy on the opposite side to the earth to the super - kamiokande . for the purpose , taking the atmospheric neutrino energy spectrum on the opposite side of the earth to the detector which sk utilizes  @xcite",
    ", we choose a neutrino with some energy by the random sampling from this spectrum .    .",
    "]    . ]",
    "neutrinos thus chosen penetrate into the interior of the earth and interact at some point inside the earth after the traverse through the layer with different densities shown in figure [ fig:02 ]  @xcite .",
    "the interaction points of the neutrino events concerned are determined by the random sampling , following the probability function for the given neutrino interaction mean free path where the change of the density of the earth is taken into account , referring to the preliminary reference earth model  @xcite .",
    "the interaction mean free paths of the neutrinos for given energies concerned depend on the both density of the location and the zenith angle of the incident neutrino .    in figure [ fig:03 ] and figure [ fig:04 ] , we give them in @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes zenith angle of the incident neutrino , as examples .",
    "furthermore , the neutrino concerned produces a daughter muon by deep inelastic scattering  @xcite , the energy of which is also determined by the random sampling , following the probability function for the charged current ( deep inelastic scattering ) differential cross section concerned  @xcite .    as for _ upward going muon events _ and _ upward stopping muon events _ in our computer numerical experiment",
    ", we could get the essential information around them , namely , what nature the neutrinos concerned have ( normal or anti- ) , their location where they are produced and what energies they have , what category they belong to ( _ upward through going muon events _ or _ upward stopping muon events _ ) , while the real experiments by sk give only the discrimination between _ upward through going muon events _ and _ upward stopping muon events_.    ) for different energies . ]    ) for different energies . ]    exactly speaking , the procedure which we really utilize is slightly different from what we just mention above , although it is mathematically equivalent to what we mention above .",
    "our real procedure adopted is as follows : instead of sampling the neutrino concerned directly from the incident neutrino energy spectrum on the surface of the earth and pursing it from its interaction point in stochastic manner , we define the neutrino interaction probability function at @xmath5 which is measured from the surface of the earth , in the following .",
    "@xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mean free path of the neutrino interaction for normal and anti - neutrino with @xmath8 at the depth @xmath9 , respectively where the density of the earth is @xmath10 and @xmath4 denotes nadir angle . here , we consider the deep inelastic charged current interaction  @xcite and density of the earth is taken from the preliminary reference earth model  @xcite . here",
    ", we adopt the deep inelastic scattering exclusively as the cause of neutrino interaction , because other neutrino interactions could be neglected for our case .    by combining eq.([eq : pintdt ] ) with the atmospheric neutrino energy spectrum at the opposite side of the earth to sk , we construct @xmath11 , neutrino interaction energy spectrum without neutrino oscillations for normal and anti - neutrino which denotes frequency of the neutrino interaction in @xmath12 in the following , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the atmospheric neutrino spectrum for normal and anti - neutrino at the opposite side of the earth to sk detector  @xcite .    the neutrino interaction energy spectrum , @xmath15 , , denotes frequency for neutrino interaction in @xmath12for null oscillation . the @xmath16 chosen in relation to the maximum energy of neutrino energy spectrum in the following .",
    "the maximum energies of the emitted muons are equal to energies of the parent neutrino with maximum primary energy .",
    "we utilize the incident neutrino energy spectrum by honda et al .",
    "@xcite which is also utilized by sk , the maximum energy of which is @xmath17 tev .",
    "therefore , we adopt @xmath17 tev as the maximum energy of muon to be pursued in our computer numerical experiment .",

    "tev muon in the standard rock .",
    "]    now , we decide the maximum range for @xmath17 tev muon which is necessary for our computer numerical experiment . for the purpose ,",
    "we simulate muons with 10 tev in stochastic manner exactly , taking into consideration of the all processes of bremsstrahlung , direct electron pair production , nuclear interaction and ionization loss .    in figure [ fig:05 ] ,",
    "we give the range fluctuation of @xmath17 tev muon thus obtained in the standard rock .",
    "it is easily understood from the figure that the range of the muon is widely distributed by the fluctuation due to nature in these elementary processes .",
    "the shorter ranges than their average are caused by catastrophic energy loss due to the bremsstrahlung and nuclear interaction ( see , for example , figure [ fig:09 ] ) , while longer ranges than their average are caused essentially by lager number of the direct electron pair production ( continuous energy loss - like)(see , for example figure [ fig:10 ] ) . from figure [ fig:05 ]",
    ", we could adopt @xmath18 @xmath19 as the maximum range of 10 tev muon .",
    "in other word , when muons with 10 tev are produced at the place far @xmath18 @xmath19 from the detector , such muons never reach the detector .",
    "therefore , it is enough for us to have interest in high energy neutrinos only which are produced within @xmath18 @xmath19 from the detector .",
    "now , we take @xmath18 @xmath19 as @xmath16 which is defined in eq.([eq : nintnulldt ] ) .",
    "the generation points of such muons distribute uniformly within @xmath16 , because @xmath16 is smaller by higher order magnitude of the mean free path of the neutrino for deep inelastic scattering . in figure [ fig:06 ] , we give the range straggling with 1 tev muon obtained in similar manner as in figure [ fig:05 ] . from figures [ fig:05 ] and [ fig:06 ] , it is easily supposed that the effect of the range fluctuation in higher energy muon could not be neglected in spite of the rapid decrease of the higher energy muon in muon energy spectrum .",
    "our computer numerical experiment for definite zenith angle of the incident neutrino is being carried out as follow :    we calculate the neutrino interaction probability from eq.([eq : pintdt ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath5 is defined as the distance from the surface of the earth to @xmath16 .",
    "next , we calculate the interaction neutrino energy spectrum from eq.([eq : nintnulldt ] ) .    by using @xmath20",
    "thus obtained from eq.([eq : nintnulldt ] ) , we sample randomly @xmath8 , the energy of the incident ( anti- ) neutrino to be pursued in the following way .",
    "@xmath21 , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 denote the maximum and minimum energy of the neutrino concerned , respectively . and @xmath24 denote uniform random number between ( 0,1 ) .",
    "we determine the interaction point of the ( anti- ) neutrino event with energy determined by procedure b. by using @xmath24 , the uniform random number between ( 0,1 ) , we determine the interaction point @xmath25 .",
    "namely , the neutrino interaction occurs from the detector , @xmath9 is given as , @xmath26 the detailed study on the pursuit of high energy muon , relating to the range energy relation , will appear in a separate paper elsewhere .",
    "the @xmath27 , the energy of the emitted ( anti-)muon which occur at @xmath28 from the detector produced by @xmath29 is determined from the following equation , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the differential cross section of the deep inelastic scattering for ( anti- ) neutrino  @xcite and @xmath32 equal to the @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath33 is a uniform random number between ( 0,1 ) .    for the ( anti-)muon whose energy and production point is determined from procedures c and d",
    ", we examine the behavior of the trajectory of the ( anti-)muon toward the sk detector in a stochastic manner .",
    "namely , each individual muon is pursued exactly by taking into consideration of the processes of bremsstrahlung , direct electron pair production , nuclear interaction and ionization loss in the stochastic manner without utilizing the average behavior of the muon concerned , the procedure of which is adopted by sk  @xcite . as the result of it , we determine finally , which category each individual muon pursued falls into : [ a ] stopping before it reaches the detector , [ b ] stopping inside detector , or [ c ] passing through the detector .",
    "we repeat procedures  a to e and obtain the neutrino events without oscillation for a given live time for the real experiment . in our computer numerical experiment ,",
    "we have accumulated the events concerned which correspond to the real live time for sk . for each neutrino event , we know @xmath8 , the energy of the parent neutrino , @xmath34 , the energy of the daughter ( anti-)muon,@xmath35 , the interaction point , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , the direction of both the incident ( anti-)neutrino and the emitted ( anti-)muon , respectively , and @xmath5 , the distance between the interaction point of the neutrino events and the opposite side of the earth .        in the case without neutrino oscillation , we repeat from procedures a to e , starting from the interaction energy spectrum(eq.([eq : nintnulldt ] ) ) .",
    "finally , we obtain frequencies for _ upward stopping muon events _ and _ upward through going muon events _ for given zenith angle for null oscillation .",
    "thus , we obtain the zenith angle distributions for these categorically different events without neutrino oscillation after summation over zenith angle .    in the case with neutrino oscillation ,",

    "thus , eq.([eq : xi_nintnull ] ) should be replaced by @xmath45 , by using eq.([eq : nintoscdt ] ) and other procedure are not changed .",
    "the procedures a to e in both cases without oscillation and with oscillation is illustrated in figure [ fig : chart ] .",
    "in figure [ fig:07 ] , we give the differential neutrino interaction energy spectrum with oscillation ( eq.([eq : nintoscdt ] ) ) for different zenith angle from which we randomly sample the energy of the neutrino event concerned .    from the figure",

    "the excellent agreement between the theoretical curve ( solid line ) and the results sampled ( histogram ) guarantees the validity of the sampling procedure by eq.([eq : xi_nintosc ] ) .    the nature of oscillatory in the neutrino interaction energy spectrum a play crucial role below @xmath46 gev under the sk neutrino oscillation parameters , on which we will examine in a series of the subsequent papers in detail .              the physical origin of _",
    "upward through going muon events _ is the same that of _ stopping muon events _ and the only difference between them lies in the situation that the former may eventually pass through the detector , while the latter may eventually stop the both initiated by the deep inelastic scattering .    the generation point of the neutrino event concerned",
    "is given eq.([eq : ti ] ) .",
    "as the generation point of the neutrino event distribute over _ dl _",
    "( @xmath47 g / cm@xmath44 in our case ) randomly shown in figure [ fig : detector_upward ] , the most biggest fluctuation in the muon behavior essentially comes from the generation point of the neutrino events over @xmath16 .",
    "such fluctuation could not be considered in the detector simulation by sk .",
    "the energy of the neutrino is sampled randomly from eq.([eq : xi_nintosc ] ) and the energy of the emitted muon from the neutrino event concerned is sampled randomly from eq.([eq : xi_d ] ) .",
    "the muons whose energies and whose generation points thus determined are simulated in the stochastic manner exactly , taking into account of the all processes of the direct electron pair production , bremsstrahlung , nuclear interaction and ionization loss .",
    "namely , these muons thus sampled lose their energies in stochastic manner in the course of their passages toward sk detector .",
    "in summarized speaking , the fluctuation effect in the muon behavior secondarily comes from the range fluctuation of the muon , although this effect is rather small compared with the effect from the generation point of the neutrino events but could not be neglected .    even if the physical natures of the muons are exactly same , some muon may be classified as the _ upward through going muon events _ or may be done as _ stopping muon events _ eventually due to the complicated geometry  configuration of @xmath49  for muons concerned , which is schematically shown in figure [ fig : detector_upward ] .",
    "we take into account of the complicated circumstances for the muons concerned as exactly as possible . as the results of it",
    ", we could discriminate finally _ upward through going muon events _ from the _ stopping muon events_.    among elementary processes contributed to muon energy losses , the process of the direct electron pair production , bremsstrahlung and nuclear interaction play important roles from the point of fluctuation . in figures",
    "[ fig:09 ] and [ fig:10 ] , how these three elementary processes take place randomly in the stochastic ways are indicated as the functions of the traversed distance in standard rock by a muon with 10 tev .",
    "therefore , we treat the muon energy loss in stochastic manner exactly .            in the figures ,",
    "we show graphically where , which interaction ( electron direct pair production , bremsstrahlung or nuclear interaction ) occurs and what energy with respect to the primary energy is lost by the interaction concerned .",
    "the @xmath50 denotes the sustained energy of the muon concerned as the result of all possible energy losses .",
    "the * d * denote the energy loss due to direct electron pair production , * b * is the energy loss due to the bremsstrahlung and * n * denotes nuclear interaction , respectively .",
    "the ratio denotes the ratio of energy loss concerned to the primary energy .    in figure",
    "[ fig:09 ] , we give an example of a muon with shorter range , say , @xmath51 meter .",
    "we could understand the muon loses about @xmath52 % catastrophically at the early stage by the bremsstrahlung and bigger energy losses may come from the bremsstrahlung and nuclear interaction and smaller energy losses essentially come from the direct electron pair production . in figure [ fig:10 ] which is contrast to figure [ fig:09 ] , we give an example of a muon with range over @xmath53 meters . in this case ,",
    "bremsstrahlung and nuclear interaction do not contribute to bigger energy losses and the accumulation of large number of the direct electron pair production events with rather smaller energies result in bigger energy loss .",
    "on the contrary to our exact treatment on the individual muon behavior , sk seem to treat them in the sense of as the average theory @xcite .",
    "sk utilize the following conventional formula , revised by lohmann , knop and voss  @xcite .",
    "@xmath54 then , this description expresses the average energy loss of the muon which does not give the range straggling of the muon and dose not expresses the real energy loss by individual muon . when the energy of the muon is not so pretty high where we could neglect the fluctuation effect of the muon range in individual case",
    ", we could apply this expression to the analysis of real behavior of the muon .",
    "however , the energy region for muon where we are interested in is now rather high and , therefore , we should pursue the muon behavior in the stochastic manner exactly , but in not average theory , even if the fluctuation effect is taken into account .",
    "it should be emphasized that the average picture of the muons obtained from the average theory like eq.([eq : dedx ] ) does not describe the individual behavior of the muon concerned and the average picture of the muons is the average behavior of the individual muon which is deviated from their average behavior when we could not neglect the fluctuation effect coming from their stochastic nature in the elementary processes .",
    "furthermore , it should be noticed that the stochastic treatment to the individual muon becomes important in the analysis of statistically insufficient number of the events concerned .",
    "in summarized speaking , the fluctuation effect in the muon behavior secondarily comes from the range fluctuation of the muon , although this effect is rather small compared with the effect from the generation point of the neutrino events but could not be neglected .      in figure [ fig:11 ]",
    "we compare the experimental results by sk with corresponding our computer numerical results for both with neutrino oscillation and without neutrino oscillation in the case of _ upward through going muon events _ for the same 1645.9 live days  @xcite . from the figure",
    ", we could not conclude the experimental data agree with null oscillation or with oscillation .",
    "the 1645.9 live days is not enough for extracting definite conclusion on the neutrino oscillation under sk neutrino oscillation even if it is possible to get sk neutrino oscillation parameters through the analysis of _ upward through going muon events _ , because the statistical fluctuation from the average values is not small .",
    "if we compare our results with oscillation to our results without oscillation in the figure , we could find the event number with oscillation is larger than that without oscillation in the three bins ( 0.0 @xmath55 -0.1 ) , ( -0.1 @xmath55 -0.2 ) and ( -0.9 @xmath55 -1.0 ) .",
    "such phenomena come from the statistical fluctuation due to insufficient sampling ( accumulation ) of the neutrino events .            in figure [ fig:12 ] , we give corresponding results from our computer numerical experiment for 164590 days , one hundred times of the sk real live days .",
    "now , we understand from the figure that our results with oscillation are always smaller than that without oscillation which attributes to larger statistics .",
    "this denotes that sampling numbers for 164590 live days is quite enough for extracting the definite conclusion on the neutrino oscillation around the sk neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "furthermore , it is reasonable to say from the figure that we could not discriminate the difference in both with null oscillation and with oscillation under sk oscillation parameters from our computer numerical experiment . in other words , this is quite understandable , because the definition of the _ upward through going muon events _ is the muon events , the minimum energy of which is only given @xmath55 1.6 gev and nothing more both the incident energy , say , nobody knows both generation points and termination points and energies of the events concerned , but knows their zenith angle merely",
    ". it should be rather curious , if we really could extract definite neutrino oscillation parameters from such extremely poor information around the events concerned .    in figure [ fig:12 ] ,",
    "we add , on purpose , the sk experimental data for 1645.9 live days together with our data for 164590 live days 450 live years as one hundred times as sk real live days . from the comparison between sk results for 1645.9 live days and",
    "our result for 164590 live days 450 live years , we could not conclude directly that sk experimental data rather agree with our results with oscillation , because statistics of both results is quite different from each other and we do not allow to compare them directly .    comparing the smoothness of the histograms in figure [ fig:11 ] with these in figure [ fig:12 ] , we could conclude that the average values of zenith angle distributions attain sufficiently at the true ones .",
    "in other words , we think sk live days does not give enough statistics to extract clear cut conclusion under sk neutrino oscillation parameters from the analysis of _ upward through going muon events _ , even if sk finally could give definite neutrino oscillation parameters from the analysis of _ fully contained events _ and _ partially contained events_.    in figure [ fig:13 ] , we give the correlation diagram between the energies of the emitted muons and the distance from their occurrence points up to the detector for _ upward through going muon events _ for null oscillation , pursuing the muons concerned in stochastic manner .",
    "the average energy of the emitted muons is 390 gev and their average distance 161 meter .    in figure [ fig:14 ]",
    ", we give the corresponding quantities for oscillation .",
    "the average energy of the emitted muons is 402 gev and their average distance is 168 meters .",
    "it is easily understood from the figure [ fig:13 ] and figure [ fig:14 ] that the contribution from higher energy part of the muon could not negligible , which is larger beyond the expectation by sk whose analysis is based on the average theory for muon propagation . furthermore , comparing the figure [ fig:13 ] with figure [ fig:14 ] , we could not find clear differences between them , which denote the difficulty in extracting the sk oscillation parameters from the analysis of the _ upward through going muon events_.                * figure [ fig:13 ] .",

    "we give the distance distribution for _ upward through going muon events _ in the cases of both null oscillation and the oscillation for 1645.9 sk live days .",
    "the distance denotes the interval from the generation point of the events concerned to the detector .",
    "it is easily understood from the figure that we could not discriminate the difference in both cases well , which suggests difficulty in extracting the definite sk neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "now , we return the sk original data for _ upward through going muon events _ which we reproduce it in figure [ fig:16 ] .",
    "now , we point out clear contradiction in figure [ fig:16 ] .",
    "the first to be examined is that frequency of the experimental data is significantly larger than that of their monte carlo simulation without oscillation in the wider region ( -0.6 , 0.0 ) for @xmath56 and the second is rather nice agreement between them in the region ( -1.0,-0.6 ) for @xmath56 .",
    "the first denotes that usually we should expect smaller frequency with oscillation than that without oscillation .",
    "however , here , the situation becomes reverse which contradict with the commonsense .",
    "furthermore , in the region ( 1.0,-0.6 ) for @xmath56 , the effect of the neutrino oscillation should be pronounced due to longer path length of the incident neutrino",
    ". however , the real situation seems to indicate no oscillation . in this case , there are three possible interpretations to such a situation .",
    "namely , [ a ] monte carlo simulation is not unreliable , while the experimental data is reliable including statistical uncertainty , [ b ] monte carlo simulation is reliable , while statistics of the experimental data is too small to give larger frequency of the neutrino events compared with monte carlo events , [ c ] neither experimental data nor monte carlo data is unreliable to exclude the definite oscillation parameters .",
    "furthermore , from the view point of the comparison between experimental data and monte carlo one , we should make two comments : the fist is that sk monte carlo simulation does not consider the real behaviors of the muons in stochastic manner , but their average behaviors only .",
    "the second is that it is not suitable way to compare experimental data for 1645.9 days with monte carlo one for 100 live years , because of big difference in statistics between them .",
    "the normalization of 100 live yeas to 1645.9 days never guarantees the validity of their transformation without examination on the validity concerned .    to clarify the contradiction in figure [ fig:16 ] , it is necessary for sk to disclose their monte carlo procedure in detail .",
    "it is natural to think that _ upward stopping muon events _ are much influenced by fluctuation , compared with _",
    "upward through going muon events _ , because they are more directly influenced by the complicated geometry of the detector with regard to the incident neutrinos than _ upward through going muon events _ are done .    in figure",
    "[ fig:17 ] , we compare the sk experimental data for 1645.9 live days with our data with oscillation and without oscillation for _ upward stopping muon events _ for the same 1645.9 live days . from the figure , also , we could conclude that sk experimental data neither agree with our data with oscillation nor that without oscillation . in the figure",

    "now , we examine energy spectra of the parent neutrinos and their daughter muons for the _ upward through going muon events _ and the _ stopping muon events _ with different @xmath65 .    in figures",
    "[ fig:22 ] , [ fig:23 ] and [ fig:24 ] , we give energy spectra of _ upward through going muon events _ for @xmath66 , ( upward ) @xmath67(diagonally ) and @xmath68(horizontally ) , respectively for sk live days , 1645.9 days . in figure",
    "[ fig:25 ] , [ fig:26 ] and [ fig:27 ] , we give the energy spectra of the _ stopping muon events _ for the same for the same sk live days .",
    "it seems to be clear from figures [ fig:22 ] to [ fig:27 ] that all these energy spectra are never smooth which denote insufficient statistics to extract definite conclusions , particularly as shown in figure [ fig:24 ] .    in figures",
    "[ fig:22 ] , [ fig:23 ] and [ fig:24 ] , we give the average energies for parent neutrinos and daughter muons ( in parentheses ) in the case of the _ upward through going muon events _ for @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively , namely 529gev ( 343gev ) , 657gev ( 500gev ) and 658 gev ( 407gev ) .",
    "the corresponding average energy for the parent neutrino in sk is @xmath69100 gev  @xcite which is pretty smaller than that our values . in figure",
    "[ fig:25 ] , [ fig:26 ] and [ fig:27 ] , we give the average energies of the _ stopping muon events _ for the same @xmath70 , 290gev ( 216gev ) , 134gev ( 54gev ) and 28gev ( 16gev ) , respectively . the corresponding average energy for neutrino by sk is @xmath69 5 gev  @xcite which is also too smaller than our corresponding values .    as for obtaining the average energy of the _ upward through going muon events _ , sk utilize the average theory which is unsuitable , as already mentioned , for the analysis of real behavior of high energy muon and , therefore , they could not consider the contribution from higher energy muons correctly .    as for the estimation of the average energy of _ stopping muon events",
    "_ , it seems to be curious that their average energy by sk is nearly same as or a little higher than that of multi - gev events . because multi - gev events comes from essentially single meson scattering , while _",
    "stopping muon events _ come from deep inelastic scattering , and the effective energy for single meson scattering is too lower than that of deep inelastic scattering ( see , figure [ fig:15 ] in the sk paper  @xcite ) .",
    "the difference in the effective energies between _ upward through going muon events _ and _ stopping muon events _ comes from the difference in the effective ranges from the same elementary process , say , deep inelastic scattering . also , sk estimate that generation points up to the detector distributed over 0 meters to several hundred meters  @xcite . too small estimation on average energy as well as the generation points for",
    "_ upward stopping muon _ by sk might come from the utilization of the average theory on energy loss of the muon .    here",
    ", let us remark the relation between oscillatory nature of the primary neutrino interaction energy spectrum and their influence over _ upward through going muon events _ and _ stopping muon events_. it s easily understood from figures [ fig:22 ] to [ fig:27 ] , referring to figure [ fig:07 ] , that neutrinos contributed to both _",
    "upward through going muon events _ and _ stopping muon events _ for all their zenith angles come from pretty high energies which belong non - oscillatory part of the incident neutrino interaction energy spectrum under the specified neutrino oscillation parameters by sk .    in other word , we should say that the analysis of _ upward through going muon events _ and _ stopping muon events _ are not suitable means for proving the existence of neutrino oscillation under sk neutrino oscillation parameters .      here , we compare sk monte carlo simulation in the case of null oscillation for enough statistics with our corresponding computer numerical experiment .",
    "now , we compare sk monte carlo results for 100 live years with ours for 450 live years for both _ upward through going muon events _ and _ stopping muon events _ in the case of null oscillation . strictly speaking , sk results for 100 live years should be compared with ours for same live year . or our results for 450 live years",
    "should be compared with the sk results for same live years . however , as sk data for 100 live years are supposed to attain at the enough statistics which is free from fluctuation , compared with that for 1645.9 days , we might be allowed to compare directly sk data for 100 live years with our data for 450 live years .            from figure [ fig:28 ]",
    "we understand that general tendency is similar to each other and our results give larger value than sk results .",
    "it is reasonable , if we take into account of the fact that sk neglect the range fluctuation in high energy muon .    in figure",
    "[ fig:29 ] , we give the direct comparison between sk results and our results for _ upward stopping muon events_. here , sk results give larger values than our results , on the contrary to figure [ fig:28 ] .",
    "this reversed situation between figure [ fig:28 ] and figure [ fig:29 ] seems to be curious , if we take into account of the range fluctuation of high energy muon .",
    "also , tendencies in the sk histograms in figure [ fig:29 ] are somewhat unnatural in lack in smoothness in spite of huge statistics .",
    "it is desirable for sk to disclose their essential information on their monte carlo method for the case of the null oscillation in order to clarify the difference between sk s and ours .",
    "the techniques for our monte carlo method fully disclose in the present paper . as for our monte carl simulation for the neutrino events inside the detector , we disclose our procedure in detail in the subsequent papers .",
    "thus , the followings should be concluded : + ( a ) the fluctuation effect in the high energy muon behavior from the neutrino event ( due to deep inelastic scattering ) primarily comes from the uniformly randomness of the generation point of the neutrino events concerned .",
    "this effect could not be treated in the correct manner in the detector simulation by sk .",
    "+ ( b ) also , the consideration of the range fluctuation in high energy muon is inevitable , although this effect is pretty smaller than that from the generation point of the neutrino events .",
    "we consider this effect exactly in the stochastic manner . on the other hand",
    ", sk analyzes the behavior of muons in the average theory , namely , in the concept of the average energy loss and average range , not treating them in stochastic manner .",
    "combined of [ a ] with [ b ] , we claim that experimental results for the _ upward through going muon events _ and the _ stopping muon events _ do not show the evidence under sk neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "+ ( c ) generally speaking , it is difficult to imagine rationally to extract so definite conclusion around neutrino oscillation parameters , say , @xmath71 and @xmath72 through the analysis of the _ upward through going muon events _ and _ stopping muon events_. because , there are too few information around such categorized events to extract the definite conclusion on the neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "such categorized events provide the direction of the incident neutrino only . _",
    "upward through going muon events _ never provide us the energies of the incident neutrinos , their interaction point and the energies of the emitted muons , their stopping points , giving the information on their penetration through the detector only . _ stopping muon events _",
    "gives the information that they stop inside the detector and other information not obtained by them are same as the _ upward through going muon events_. + ( d ) even if the sk neutrino oscillation parameters exist really , it is difficult to estimate them from the analysis of _ upward through going muon events _ and _ stopping muon events_. because , the effective energies to detect the sk neutrino oscillation parameters , say , smaller than 40 gev , do not lie in the energy region which contribute to the production of _ upward through going muon events _ and the _ stopping muon events_. + ( e ) by the definition of the _ upward through going muon events _ and the _ stopping muon events _ in the sk , the origins of both events are same(deep inelastic scattering)and difference between them is that the former average range is longer than that of the latter so that the former average energy is higher than that of the latter .",
    "however , the latter average is so low which is rather near to the average energy due to multi - gev energy events .",
    "this is difficult to be understood . also , the zenith angle distribution for _ upward through going muon events _ is difficult to be understood in comparison with their monte carlo simulation with 100 live years .",
    "+ ( f ) even if we could obtain the sk neutrino oscillation parameters from the analysis of both _",
    "upward through going muon events _ and the _ stopping muon events _ , present statistics for experimental data obtained by 1645.9 live days is not enough for getting the sk neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "+ ( g ) as the effective energy to detect oscillatory signature of the neutrino oscillation parameters lies below 40 gev under the assumption of the sk neutrino oscillation parameters , first of all , one should concentrate to analyze the single ring muon event among the fully contained events , the most clear cut event from the quasi elastic scattering in gev energy region .    generally speaking",
    ", it is rather difficult to extract so definite physical quantities , such as , neutrino oscillation parameters from the atmospheric neutrino beams which include much uncertainty factors , such as , the incident neutrino energy spectrum .",
    "the throughout and concentrated analysis of the single ring lepton events are inevitable , if we really extract definite parameters from the cosmic ray experiment in spite of the existence of much uncertainty factors involved .",
    "we are now going to complete our works along this line and will present our results from the computer numerical experiment , focusing on the analysis of single - ring muon events as a series of subsequent papers elsewhere .",
