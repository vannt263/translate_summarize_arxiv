    "this kind of quantum criticality can be found in a wide variety of models in different communities , which range from nuclear physics , with the interacting boson  @xcite and the lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) models  @xcite , to quantum monodromy in molecular physics  @xcite and the dicke and jaynes - cummings models in quantum optics  @xcite .",

    "since there is currently a rising interest in the experimental investigation of driven mean - field - type spin models  @xcite , it is natural to ask if signatures analogous to esqpts in undriven systems can also be found in driven systems , where the energy is not conserved and it is not possible to define either a ground state or excited states .    in this paper",
