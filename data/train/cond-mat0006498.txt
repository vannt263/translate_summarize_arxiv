    "the recent achievements in the field of semiconductor nanostructures have prompted a strong effort in developing local experimental probes , in order to obtain spatial maps of the nanostructures and their quantum states .",
    "while conventional optical spectroscopy gives information on a large region containing thousands of nanostructures , confocal diffraction - limited microscopy has allowed the investigation of individual nanostructures @xcite . to probe the spatial distribution of quantum states ,",
    "the spatial resolution must be reduced much below the optical wavelength ; this has been obtained by means of near - field scanning optical microscopy ( nsom ) @xcite . in semiconductor quantum wires @xcite and dots @xcite the resolution of these experiments has been increasing in recent years .    from the theoretical point of view it was soon recognized that the interpretation of nsom spectroscopic data requires to take into account the effects of the fiber tip and dielectric discontinuities on the electromagnetic ( em ) field generated in the sample .",
    "for example , the near - field distribution of the em - field @xcite and its interaction with arrays of point - like particles @xcite have been studied in detail .",
    "on the other hand , the interactions of a highly inhomogeneous em - field with the quantum states in the semiconductor nanostructures received much less attention @xcite . a theoretical effort in this direction",
    "is important for different reasons .",
    "first , when the dipole approximation is abandoned and the non - local response of the medium is taken into account , local absorption itself is in principle ill defined ( i.e. , it is not independent of the em - field distribution , as we will show ) ; a general theoretical reformulation is therefore required .",
    "in addition , it may be expected that spatial interference of quantum states plays an important role when variations of the electromagnetic field occur on a ultra - short length scale , i.e. , on the scale of the bohr radius ; hence , the necessity to describe the local absorption via a non - local susceptibility .",
    "the analogy with ultra - fast time - resolved spectroscopies @xcite , that have demonstrated the importance of phase coherence in the quantum - mechanical time evolution of photoexcited carriers @xcite , suggests that similar effects may occur in the space domain .    to investigate the response of semiconductor nanostructures under these conditions , we have recently proposed @xcite a theoretical approach based on a microscopic description of electronic quantum states and their coulomb interaction .",
    "our approach is intended to treat very high resolution probes , which might be capable to reveal coulomb induced coherence effects ; therefore , we consider an inhomogeneous em - field distribution with a spatial extension of the order of the bohr radius of the material @xcite . in this paper",
    "we describe in detail our theoretical approach and present absorption spectra calculated in the linear response regime for a set of semiconductor quantum wires ( qwr ) with realistic geometry and composition , focusing on t - shaped structures as those obtained by the cleaved - edge overgrowth technique .",
    "we find that new features in the space - resolved optical spectra arise , particularly in coupled nanostructures , owing to interference effects in the interacting electron - hole wavefunction , and conclude that coulomb effects on the local spectra must be taken into account for a correct assignment of the experimental features .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : nls ] , we derive the microscopic expression of the non - local susceptibility , including coulomb interaction between electrons and holes , which is valid both in the linear and non - linear regimes . in sec .",
    "[ sec : las ] we show how a proper definition of local absorption can be introduced in the case of spatially inhomogeneous em field , which , however , depends on the shape of the em - field distribution . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nr ] we focus on the linear regime and we apply our scheme to single and coupled wire structures , studying , in particular , the effects of non - locality and coulomb - interactions on local spectra .",
    "in this section we derive a microscopic expression ( i.e. , based on microscopic electron and hole wavefunctions ) , of the non - local optical susceptibility @xmath0 ; this will be obtained through a comparison between the macroscopic and the microscopic expressions for the optical polarization of the system .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath0 allows to calculate the absorbed power defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : las ] .",
    "the macroscopic polarization @xmath1 induced by an electromagnetic field @xmath2 is in general given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the non - local ( both in space and time ) susceptibility tensor . when the time dependence of @xmath4 is through @xmath5 only ( stationary regime ) , the above equation can be transformed into a local equation in the frequency ( @xmath6 ) domain , i.e. , @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the fourier transforms of the time - dependent electric field and optical polarization in eq .",

    "( [ macro : pol-2 ] ) must be fully retained .",
    "note also that , contrary to bulk states , excitonic states in a nanostructure do not have translational invariance ; hence , @xmath0 depends separately on the spatial coordinates @xmath11 , @xmath12 and not on the relative coordinate alone .    from a microscopic point of view",

    "since in this paper we shall mainly focus on optical ( i.e. , electron - hole pairs ) excitations , it is convenient to work within the so - called electron - hole picture .",
    "this corresponds to writing the field operator @xmath16 as a linear combination of electron and hole single - particle states : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote destruction operators for an electron in state @xmath20 and a hole in state @xmath21 . here",

    "however , considering a light field with a given profile @xmath81 centered around the beam position @xmath82 , @xmath83 , we may define a local absorption that is a function of the beam position , and relates the _ total _ absorbed power to the power of a _ local _ excitation ( illumination mode ) : @xmath84   \\xi({\\bf r}-{\\bf r})\\xi({\\bf r'}-{\\bf r})\\,d{\\bf r}\\,d{\\bf r ' } \\ .\\ ] ]    this expression is in principle not limited to low - photoexcitation intensities ; via @xmath85 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ chi2 ] ) it provides a general description of linear as well as non - linear local response , i.e. , from excitonic absorption to the gain regime . on the other hand , in the linear - response regime @xmath86 and the quantity @xmath87",

    "( [ exc_contrib ] ) . for a spatially homogeneous em - field ,",
    "the absorption spectrum probes the average of @xmath90 over the whole space ( global spectrum ) . in the opposite limit of an infinitely narrow probe beam , @xmath91 ) maps @xmath92 ;",
    "the local absorption is non - zero at any point where the exciton wavefunction gives a finite contribution .",
    "it is therefore clear that `` forbidden '' excitonic transitions , not present in the global spectrum , may appear in the local one . in the intermediate regime of a narrow but finite probe , it is possible that a cancellation of the contributions from @xmath90 at different points in space takes place , leading to a non trivial localization of the absorption .",
    "the result will then be quite sensitive to the extension of the light beam .",
    "the theoretical formulation of secs .  [ sec : nls ] and [ sec : las ] is valid for semiconductors of arbitrary dimensionality . to illustrate the effects of non - locality and coulomb interaction on the local absorption spectrum , we now consider quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) nanostructures ( quantum wires ) , subject to a local em excitation propagating parallel to the free axis of the structure , @xmath93 . for simplicity",
    ", we describe the narrow light beam by a gaussian em - field profile , @xmath94 $ ] @xcite . the explicit expressions for quasi-1d systems are derived in the appendix .    as a prototype system",
    ", we have chosen to investigate systems composed of gaas / alas t - shaped qwrs , which rank among the best available samples from the point of view of optical properties , and allow for a strong quantum confinement @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1t](a ) we show the ground - state effective wavefunction [ eq .  ( [ effwfc ] ) ] for a single qwr , including the electron - hole interaction ; the exciton is strongly localized at the intersection of the parent qw s , the localization being dominated by that of the hole state which has a heavier effective mass @xcite . when the effect of a locally inhomogeneous em field with a gaussian shape ( @xmath95 nm ) is simulated [ fig .",
    "[ fig:1t](b ) ] , we find that the signal exibits a maximum at the location of the exitonic wavefunction , but the details of the shape of the wavefunction are lost as , for this particular sample , they take place on a scale shorter than @xmath96 .    the above situation for a single qwr can be contrasted with the situation for two coupled qwrs . in the latter case",
    "the exitonic states of the two qwrs are coupled by coulomb interaction if their mutual distance is @xmath97 ; therefore , in this case the non - local character of the coulomb interaction can be exposed by a local probe with @xmath98 . to exemplify this , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 t ] the effective wavefunction of ( a ) the ground and ( b ) the first excited excitonic states for two coupled , symmetric qwrs , including electron - hole coulomb interaction .",
    "it should be noted that 1 ) the two excitonic states confined in the two qwrs are strongly coupled by effect of the coulomb interaction and 2 ) the effective wavefunction is not positive definite but is even or odd for the ground and first excited state , respectively ; as consequence , in a homogenous em field only the ground state appears in the spectrum , while the first excited state is prohibited by a selection rule arising from the cancellation between positive and negative regions [ see eq .",
    "( [ exc_contrib ] ) ] .",
    "this selection rule is relaxed in a local optical spectroscopy experiment , if variations of the em field takes place on a scale comparable to the modulations of the effective wavefunction . in fact , when the center of mass of the beam does not coincide with a symmetry point of the structure , the symmetry of the whole system is broken ; consequently , cancellations do not take place exactly ; moreover , they are a function of the position and extension of the beam .",
    "it should be stressed that the spatial dependence of the absorption in the coupled qwr structure is dominated by coulomb interaction , thus making very high resolution local optical spectroscopy a very powerful tool . to demonstrate this aspect ,",
    "we have simulated a local optical spectroscopy experiment by calculating the local absorption spectra while sweeping the tip of the probe across a double - qwr structure ; the influence of inter - wire coulomb interaction is demonstrated in fig.[fig : panel ] , where full calculations including electron - hole interaction ( center panels ) are compared with calculations where the correlation is switched off ( left panels ) .",
    "for this example we have chosen a set of asymmetric structures composed of two sligthly different qwrs , with various distances between the stems of the wires . in the uncorrelated spectra",
    "we can only distinguish two peaks arising from single - particle transitions localized in either wires ; the two peaks shift in energy as a functions of the inter - wire distance , decreasing from top to bottom , as a result of the increasing overlap between the single - particle states localized in the two qwrs , and are accompained by a high - energy tail which is due to the single particle joint density of states .",
    "note that there is no sign of spatially indirect transitions connecting an electron and a hole localized in different wires .",
    "the situation is very different when coulomb correlation is taken into account .",
    "first , we note that for the larger wire separation ( top row ) ( i ) the two main peaks , arising from a direct transitions located in either wires , are red - shifted by the exciton binding energy , and ( ii ) the high - energy continua are suppressed , as expected from previous studies of total absorption in quasi-1d structures @xcite . when the inter - wire distance is decreased , new peaks appear in the spectra whose energy , intensity and location is strongly dependent upon the coupling between the two wires , which increases from top to bottom in fig .  [",
    "fig : panel ] .",
    "these peaks result from interference between positive and negative regions of the effective wavefuctions , whose square modulus is shown in the right column for comparison .",
    "figure [ fig : spectra ] compares the local spectra obtained with a tip position located in the center of the right and left wire with the total absorption for the same set of coupled qwrs as in fig .",
    "[ fig : panel ] @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have developed a general formulation of the theory of local optical absorption in semiconductor nanostructures , taking into account quantum confinement of electron and hole states and the electron - hole coulomb interaction .",
    "we have proved that absorption is strongly influenced by the spatial interference in the exciton wavefunctions , which depends on the profile of the light beam .",
    "when the extension of the beam becomes comparable with the exciton bohr radius , local spectra are expected to display different features with respect to integrated spectra , resulting from breaking of selection rules .",
    "calculations performed for a set of coupled quantum wires show that the interpretation of near - field experiments will require a quantitative treatment of these effects as their spatial resolution increases .",
    "we thank c. simserides for a careful reading of this manuscript .",
    "this work was supported in part by infm through pra `` procry '' , and by the ec under the tmr network `` ultrafast '' and the it - project `` sqid '' .",
    "for a qwr the single - particle electron and hole envelope functions , appearing in ( [ chi2 ] ) , can be written as @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively , where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are subband indices and wavevectors along the free axis .",
    "the envelope functions @xmath103 are solutions of a schrdinger equation with effective masses and band parameters appropriate for electron / heavy - holes in the 2d confinement potential of the qwr .    in the linear regime",
    "the local absorption can be written as [ eq.[exc_contrib ] ] @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the resonance frequency , @xmath106 describes the line broadening , and @xmath107 we shall refer to @xmath108 as the _ effective exciton wavefunction _ ; according to eq .",
