    "recently , classical general relativity in higher dimensions , suggested by superstring theory , has gathered much attention .",
    "especially , many studies are devoted to higher - dimensional black holes ( see @xcite for review ) because black holes would be expected as windows to extra dimensions .",
    "one of the most interesting problems is a verification of extra dimensions by physical phenomena related to the higher - dimensional black holes .",
    "higher - dimensional black holes in accelerators @xcite and in cosmic ray @xcite and gravitational waves from higher - dimensional black holes @xcite are studied for this purpose .    in astrophysics ,",
    "the study of the classical tests of the general relativity : the light deflection , the perihelion shift , the time delay , could provide methods to know properties of the spacetime metrics around compact objects . in addition , the precession of a gyroscope @xcite is another experimental way to reveal the spacetime structure .",
    "the studies of these effects open the possibility of testing higher - dimensional models by using astronomical and astrophysical observations at the solar system scale . indeed , such problems are considered by using five - dimensional two - parameter family of kaluza - klein type solutions with an s@xmath0 symmetry @xcite , and s@xmath0 symmetric solutions in brane world models @xcite .",
    "note that the exterior spacetime is described by the schwarzschild metric for standard general relativistic spherical compact objects .",
    "however , in higher - dimensional spacetime models , the exterior metric of a static star is no longer the schwarzschild metric . in this paper",
    ", we consider another class of kaluza - klein type metrics which would describe exterior of compact objects . in the higher - dimensional spacetimes ,",
    "even if we impose the asymptotic flatness to the four - dimensional part of the spacetime , there are various possibilities of fiber bundle structures of the extra dimensions as the fiber over the four - dimensional base spacetime .",
    "the black hole solutions with non - trivial bundle structures have been studied by various authors .",
    "dobiasch and maison found the first five - dimensional vacuum kaluza - klein black hole solution which asymptotes to a twisted s@xmath1 fiber bundle over the four - dimensional minkowski spacetime @xcite , and gibbons and wiltshire clarified the meaning of the metric @xcite .",
    "later , the solution was generalized to the rotating case @xcite , and charged case in the five - dimensional einstein - maxwell theory @xcite .",
    "it is shown that this family of black holes have squashed s@xmath2 horizons , and that the metrics behave as fully five - dimensional black holes in the vicinity of horizon , while behave as four - dimensional black holes in the far region .",
    "the squashed kaluza - klein black hole solutions of cohomogeneity - one are related to asymptotically flat black hole solutions by a squashing function @xcite .",
    "some of the supersymmetric black hole solutions @xcite in the framework of ref .",
    "@xcite and non - supersymmetric solutions @xcite were constructed by the procedure of squashing .",
    "these solutions also have been generalized in various directions , e.g. , in einstein - yang - mills theory @xcite , and in einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory @xcite .",
    "motivated by the gravity probe b experiment @xcite , we focus our attention to the precession of a gyroscope in an orbit around the earth .",
    "we assume that the geometry of the region outside the earth is described by the five - dimensional vacuum static squashed kaluza - klein black hole metric @xcite .",
    "we derive the higher - dimensional correction of the precession angle to the general relativity , which is related with the size of the extra dimension .",
    "we regard a rotating axis of the gyroscope carried by a satellite as a spacelike spin - vector .",
    "while the satellite moves along the stable circular orbit around the earth , the spin - vector is parallely transported along this timelike circular geodesic . when the satellite returns to the initial position , an angular difference of the final spin - vector from the initial one appears .",
    "this is the geodetic effect @xcite .",
    "since the earth rotates , the spin - vector is dragged around the rotation axis of the earth by the kerr geometry @xcite .",
    "the frame dragging effect by the kerr rotation is quite smaller than the geodetic effect , then , we investigate the correction by the extra dimensions to the geodetic effect in this paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we review the properties of five - dimensional static squashed kaluza - klein black hole solution . in section [ geodesicsec ] , we show that the five - dimensional squashed kaluza - klein black hole spacetime admits stable circular orbits similar to the four - dimensional schwarzschild black holes . in section [ geodeticsec ] , we consider the parallel transportation of a spin - vector along a circular orbit in the squashed kaluza - klein black hole spacetime , then derive the geodetic precession angle with the higher - dimensional correction .",
    "finally , we devote section [ conclsec ] to discussion .",
    "we start from the five - dimensional vacuum einstein equation , @xmath3 the static kaluza - klein black hole with a squashed s@xmath2 horizon @xcite is one of the exact solutions of .",
    "the metric is written as @xcite @xmath4   + \\frac{r_\\infty ^2}{4 u(\\rho ) } \\left ( d \\psi + \\cos \\theta d \\phi \\right ) ^2 ,   \\label{bhmet } \\\\ & d \\omega_{s^2 } ^2 : = d \\theta ^2 + \\sin",
    "^2 \\theta d \\phi^2 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath5 are given by @xmath6 and positive parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 are related as @xmath9 .",
    "the ranges of coordinates are @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the black hole horizon is located at @xmath12 , and the curvature singularity at @xmath13 is concealed behind it .",
    "the induced metric on the three - dimensional cross section of the black hole horizon with a time slice @xmath14 .",
    "is obtained as @xmath15 .",
    "\\label{indmet}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , we see that the metric of black hole horizon is the squashed s@xmath2 in the form of the hopf bundle . since @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we see that the radius of the s@xmath0 base is larger than that of the s@xmath1 fiber .    at the infinity , @xmath18",
    ", the metric behaves as @xmath19 that is , the metric asymptotes to a twisted constant s@xmath1 fiber bundle over the four - dimensional minkowski spacetime .",
    "the size of compactified extra dimension of the spacetime at the infinity is given by @xmath20 .",
    "the komar mass of this black hole is given by @xmath21 where the five - dimensional gravitational constant @xmath22 and the four - dimensional one @xmath23 are related as @xmath24    here , we discuss the physical meanings of the parameter @xmath25 in .",
    "if @xmath26 , @xmath27 dependence of the function @xmath28 is important but the function @xmath29 is almost unity for an observer outside the horizon , @xmath30 .",
    "then , the observer feels the spacetime as the four - dimensional schwarzschild black hole with a constant twisted s@xmath1 fiber with the metric @xmath31 on the other hand , if @xmath32 , the function @xmath29 becomes important for an observer at @xmath33 . with the help of a new coordinate @xmath34 and a parameter @xmath35 , since @xmath36 , the metric approaches to the five - dimensional schwarzschild - tangherlini black hole @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the metric of the unit three - sphere .",
    "then , the observer feels the spacetime as an almost @xmath39 symmetric black hole .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath25 gives the typical scale of transition from five - dimension to effective four - dimension .",
    "we consider timelike geodesics in the five - dimensional squashed kaluza - klein black hole .",
    "the lagrangian for a test particle in the metric is @xmath40 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the overdot denotes the differentiation with respect to the proper time @xmath41 , then we set the condition @xmath42 .",
    "we can obtain three constants of motion , @xmath43    here , we assume that the particle has no momentum in the extra direction , i.e. , @xmath44 . the effective lagrangian for the particle is @xmath45 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 .",
    "we see that this effective lagrangian has the same form in the case of four - dimensional spherically symmetric spacetimes .",
    "then , we can concentrate on orbits with @xmath47 on the assumption of @xmath44 . in these conditions ,",
    "we obtain the energy conservation equation @xmath48 where the effective potential is given by @xmath49 we note that with reduces to the energy conservation equation of a particle in the four - dimensional schwarzschild black hole spacetime in the limit @xmath50 . a typical shape of the effective potential @xmath51 is shown in the left panel of figure [ pots ] .",
    "we see that there is a stable circular orbit at the local minimum of the effective potential .",
    "the squashed kaluza - klein black holes , which have stable circular orbits , make remarkable contrast with the higher - dimensional asymptotically flat black holes , which have no stable bound state of particles .",
    "for the simplest example , we consider timelike geodesics in the five - dimensional schwarzschild - tangherlini black hole spacetime with the metric .",
    "we consider motions in an equatorial plane , that is , @xmath52 , then we have the energy conservation equation @xmath53 with the effective potential @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are constants of motion of the system @xcite .",
    "a typical shape of the effective potential is drawn in the right panel of figure [ pots ] .",
    "clearly , there is no stable circular orbit .",
    "the metric of squashed kaluza - klein black hole with a condition @xmath26 can be a candidate for the metric which describes a spacetime around the earth where a test particle can travel along a circular orbit .",
    "we can expect the appearance of the higher - dimensional correction , which is related to the parameter @xmath57 , to the geodetic precession effect of four - dimensional relativity .     and",
    "@xmath58 in . the same one in the five - dimensional schwarzschild - tangherlini black hole metric ( right ) with the parameters @xmath59 in . , width=566 ]    in the present paper , we restrict ourselves to a circular motion @xmath60 with @xmath44 and @xmath61",
    ". then we have @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the five - velocity of the particle . from @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    ", we have @xmath66 and @xmath67    by using , and , we obtain kepler s third law in the squashed kaluza - klein black hole spacetime as @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes the orbital period .",
    "the second term in the right hand side is the correction by the extra dimension .",
    "we regard the rotating axis of the gyroscope carried by a satellite as a spacelike spin - vector @xmath70 parallely transported along a timelike geodesic with the five - velocity @xmath71 .",

    "constants @xmath85 are determined by the orthogonality and the normalization condition as @xmath86 since we consider the situation such as @xmath87 , we have @xmath88 .",
    "then , we can regard @xmath89 and @xmath90 are almost constant for some orbital periods .",
    "further , we have @xmath91 .    during one orbital period",
    ", @xmath92 goes from @xmath93 to @xmath94 and a proper time @xmath95 goes from @xmath93 to @xmath96 , the geodetic precession angle @xmath97 is given as @xmath98 substituting and into , we obtain the geodetic precession angle in a weak - field limit as @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the predicted value by the four - dimensional einstein theory and @xmath101 is the higher - dimensional correction . for @xmath102 ,",
    "equivalently @xmath50 , the correction @xmath103 vanishes as expected . if the size of extra dimension is @xmath104 mm , we can estimate that @xmath105 for the earth .",
    "in this paper , we have considered the precession of a gyroscope in a circular orbit around a spherical compact object .",
    "we have assumed that the five - dimensional squashed kaluza - klein black hole solution describes the geometry around the compact object .",
    "we have solved the parallel transporting equation of a spin - vector along the circular timelike geodesic in the squashed kaluza - klein black hole spacetime , and derived the geodetic precession angle with the higher - dimensional correction .",
    "we have shown that the correction to the general relativity is in proportion to the square of ( size of extra dimension)/(gravitational radius of central object ) . if the size of extra dimension is order of 0.1 mm , the correction is order of @xmath106 for the earth .    in the four - dimensional general relativity , the gravitational field in vacuum with spherical symmetry",
    "is uniquely described by the schwarzschild metric . however , in the higher - dimensional spacetime with kaluza - klein structure , even if we impose an asymptotic flatness in four - dimensional section , the metric is not determined uniquely .",
    "for example , the direct product of four - dimensional schwarzschild spacetime with a small s@xmath1 is a possible metric to describe the geometry around the earth . in this case",
    ", no higher - dimensional correction appears without a momentum of gyroscope in the extra direction .",
    "in contrast , it is interesting that the correction exists even if the gyroscope moves along four - dimensional spacetime in the squashed kaluza - klein geometry .",
    "if a precise experiment of gyroscope precession in the earth orbit agrees the expected value of general relativity , it requires a rigorous upper limit of the size of extra dimension , or it excludes the squashed kaluza - klein metric for describing the geometry around the earth .",
