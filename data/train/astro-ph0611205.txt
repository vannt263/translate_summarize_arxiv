    "according to the hierarchical picture of structure formation , galaxies originated from baryons that condensed within dark - matter haloes .",
    "if this picture is correct , dark matter should exist within and around galaxies . in the case of spiral galaxies , this has been widely confirmed by the study of rotation curves that remain approximately flat beyond the visible disk , suggesting the presence of invisible matter at large distances from the galactic centre ( rubin 1991 ) . in the case of elliptical galaxies ,",
    "the general absence of rotating gas disks makes this confirmation more difficult .",
    "giant elliptical galaxies nevertheless show evidence of dark matter via stellar kinematics ( kronawitter et al .",
    "2000 ) , x - ray emission ( mathews & brighenti 2003 ) , and gravitational lensing ( keeton 2001 ) .",
    "numerical simulations of disk galaxy mergers including dark matter , like the recent work of dekel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , produce elliptical galaxies with stellar kinematics similar to what is observed .",
    "large - scale simulations of structure formation typically exclude gas and stars , due to the computational complexities associated with gaseous dissipation , radiation , star formation , etc .",
    "these simulations make well - defined predictions about the structure of baryon - free dark matter haloes and the dependence of halo properties on mass and formation redshift ( navarro et al .",
    "2004 ; diemand , moore & stadel 2004 ) .",
    "much recent work has focussed on the shapes of the haloes ( allgood et al .",
    "2006 , macci et al . 2006",
    "; bett et al .",
    "simulated haloes are found to be generically prolate / triaxial .",
    "the mean short - to - long axis ratio is @xmath0 and the distribution of @xmath1 is approximately gaussian , with a sharp cutoff below @xmath2 that probably reflects the onset of a dynamical bending instability ( merritt & sellwood 1994 ) .",
    "there are indications that mean halo elongation increases with halo mass ( allgood et al .",
    "the shapes of these simulated haloes are apparently supported mainly by anisotropic velocities rather than by figure rotation ( warren et al .",
    "1992 ) .    to the extent that luminous elliptical galaxies formed in a manner analogous to the ( simulated ) dark - matter haloes ",
    "i.e. through dissipationless clustering of smaller galaxies  one expects the structure of the two sorts of system to be similar .",
    "confirmation of this was recently demonstrated in the case of radial density profiles ( merritt et al .",
    "2005a , b ) : the same fitting function that best describes luminous elliptical galaxies is an equally good description of the @xmath3-body haloes .",
    "furthermore the simulated haloes appear to lie on the same relation between surface brightness and size ( the `` kormendy relation '' ) defined by the galaxies ( graham et al .",
    "2006 ) .    with regard to shapes",
    ", observations of elliptical galaxies yield only the projected isophotes and so determination of the intrinsic shape distribution requires either statistical analyses based on large samples ( e.g. ryden 1992 , 1996 ; tremblay & merritt 1995 , 1996 ; ryden , lauer & postman 1993 ; alam & ryden 2002 ; vincent & ryden 2005 ; plionis , basilakos & ragone - figueroa 2006 ) , or mapping of potentials via detailed kinematical data for individual galaxies ( e.g. franx , illingworth & de zeeuw 1991 ; statler et al .",
    "isophotal studies reveal that luminous and faint elliptical galaxies have significantly different shape distributions : the latter have @xmath4 while the former are flatter , @xmath5 ( tremblay & merritt 1996 ) .",
    "the apparent shape distributions are found to be mildly inconsistent with axial symmetry in the sense that too few , nearly - round galaxies are observed , but these studies do not strongly constrain the degree or distribution of triaxialities .",
    "however , detailed kinematical studies of individual galaxies sometimes find evidence for significant triaxiality ( statler et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "still less is known about the true shapes of dark matter haloes , although constraints come from x - ray studies , lensing , and milky way kinematics ( tasitsiomi 2003 ) . when comparing such data to the predictions of the @xmath3-body models , it is important to keep in mind that halo shapes are likely to be influenced by the presence of the baryons .",
    "for instance , if baryonic matter accumulates at the center of the dark - matter potential , the halo is expected to become rounder and less triaxial ( merritt & quinlan 1998 ; springel , white & hernquist 2004 ; kazantzidis et al .",
    "2004 ) .    given these uncertainties , it is worthwhile to investigate new lines of evidence that might constrain the shapes of dark - matter haloes .",
    "self - consistency studies constitute one such approach , which until now has not been explored .",
    "can stationary , dark - matter haloes of arbitrary shape co - exist with a galaxy , or does the existence of a central , baryonic mass concentration imply restrictions on the elongation or triaxiality of the halo",
    "?    in gravitational potentials that respect special symmetries ( spherical- or axi - symmetry , for instance ) , isolating integrals of the motion exist in addition to the energy",
    ". jeans s ( 1915 ) theorem provides a simple prescription for the construction of steady - state phase - space populations in such potentials : the phase - space density must be a function only of the isolating integrals",
    ". orbits in triaxial potentials sometimes respect integrals in addition to the energy ( schwarzschild 1979 ) , but the mathematical form of these integrals is typically unknown .",
    "further , many orbits in triaxial potentials are observed to respect no integrals aside from the energy ( merritt 1980 ; valluri & merritt 1998 ; papaphilippou & laskar 1998 ) .    jeans s theorem can be generalized to the non - integrable case : a steady - state galaxy is one in which the phase - space density is constant in every connected region ( kandrup 1998 ) .",
    "an example of a connected region is the invariant torus of a regular orbit , or the arnold web corresponding to the chaotic parts of phase space at a given energy ( tabor 1989 ; rasband 1990 ) .",
    "howevever jeans s theorem says nothing about how this special state is to be achieved , and stochastic orbits are often observed to remain confined to subsets of the full allowed region for long periods ( e.g. habib , kandrup & mahon 1997 ) , making it unlikely that they would achieve a uniform phase - space population even in a hubble time .    in the current work ,",
    "we use the method introduced in 1979 by schwarzschild for the numerical construction of stationary galaxy models .",
    "schwarzschild s method was tested on a modified hubble profile ( schwarzschild 1979 ) and on a plummer model ( siopis 1999 ) .",
    "later , it was used by statler ( 1987 ) to demonstrate the self - consistency of model galaxies made of stars distributed according a triaxial density profile with a central core .",
    "subsequently , high resolution observations of hst ( crane et al . 1993 ; ferrarese et al . 1994 ; lauer et al .",
    "1995 ) showed that almost all the ellipticals have densities that rise toward the centre approximately as power laws @xmath6 , with @xmath7 for fainter galaxies and @xmath8 for brighter ones .",
    "merritt & fridman ( 1996 ; hereafter mf96 ) used schwarzschild s method to construct self - consistent solutions galaxy models with both weak and strong cusps . in the case of strong cusps ,",
    "the large number of stochastic orbits made it more difficult to obtain equilibrium models .",
    "subsequent studies by merritt ( 1997 ) , siopis ( 1999 ) and terzic ( 2002 ) confirmed and extended the mf96 results . in these studies",
    ", attempts were made to represent the stochastic orbits via fully - mixed , steady - state distributions at each energy .",
    "all the works just cited dealt with galaxies containing a single ( luminous ) component only . here , we introduce a second component , the dark matter , presumably consisting of long - lived , `` cold , '' and collisionless particles , e.g. supersymmetric neutralinos ( bertone , hooper & silk 2004 ) .    in the following section we explain the method  a generalization of schwarzschild s  for constructing self - consistent equilibrium models .",
    "the details of these models are discussed in section @xmath9 while in section @xmath10 we describe their orbital characteristics . in section",
    "@xmath11 our results are analyzed and compared to those of models without dark matter . finally in s",
    "ection @xmath12 we discuss the consequences of stochasticity for the long - term stability of the models .",
    "in the absence of analytic expressions for the orbital integrals , one must resort to numerical methods to construct self - consistent models of galaxies or dark - matter haloes . to obtain a numerical solution to the problem",
    "we follow the schwarzschild ( 1979 ) scheme .",
    "the procedure can be summarized as follows :    \\(1 ) a smooth , three - dimensional mass distribution resembling observed galaxies is postulated and the corresponding gravitational potential calculated by means of poisson s equation .",
    "\\(2 ) a library of orbits is realized by integration of the equations of motion in this potential starting from a large set of different initial conditions .",
    "\\(3 ) the configuration space is divided into cells and the time each orbit spends in any cell is recorded .",
    "\\(4 ) a linear combination of these orbits ( with non - negative weights ) is sought which gives the best discrete approximation to the known masses of the cells .",
    "we generalized schwarzschild s method to the construction of two - component ( luminous and dark matter ) , self - consistent models as follows .",
    "first , we constructed a catalog of orbits integrating the equations of motion for a particle moving in the potential generated by the sum of the luminous and dark matter density distributions .",
    "then , two different grids of cells , one for the luminous and one for the dark matter components , were built .",
    "the technique used to realize each grid is the same described in mf96 : the space was first divided by @xmath13 concentric ellipsoidal shells in zones containing an equal amount of one of the two matter components .",
    "then , each octant was divided into three sectors corresponding to    * the volume with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , * the volume with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , * the volume with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "finally , we used a set of six planes to divide each sector in @xmath20 regions . in this way",
    ", we obtained a total of @xmath21 cells per octant for each grid .",
    "the fraction of time spent by each orbit of this catalog in both sets of cells was recorded .",
    "we then used the data for the luminous - matter grid ( called _ luminous _ ) to reproduce , by means of a linear superposition of orbits with non - negative occupation numbers , the given mass of the luminous component in each cell of that grid .",
    "the same procedure was followed to reproduce the dark matter distribution on the _ dark matter _ grid .    in practice ,",
    "our optimization problem consisted of minimizing , separately , the quantities @xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the fraction of time that the _ _ k__th orbit spends in the _",
    "_ j__th cell of the _ luminous _ grid and @xmath25 is the same quantity in the _",

    "one ; @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the quantities to be determined by the minimization procedure . the latter represent the total mass of stars and dark matter particles , respectively , spread along the _ _ k__th orbit ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "to guarantee non - negative orbital weights , we imposed the constraints @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the nag routine e04ncf ( stoer 1971 ; gill et al .",
    "1984 ) was used to solve these constrained least - squares problems .",
    "we considered three different mass models for the galaxy+halo system . in each of the three cases , we adopted triaxial shapes for both components but with a different radial distribution for the dark and luminous matter . in the first model the dark matter was assumed to have the same axial ratios as the luminous matter , while the second and third models were characterized by haloes that were more prolate and more oblate , respectively , than the luminous matter .    as in mf96 , we adopted the following mass distribution for the luminous component : @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 the total luminous mass ( see fig .",
    "[ mixdmv ] ) .    for the dark matter component we adopted @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the central dark matter density ( see fig . [ mixdmv ] ) .",
    "the density profile in equation  ( [ rhodm ] ) was first proposed by burkert ( 1995 ) for the dark matter haloes of dwarf galaxies , and later extended to the whole family of spiral ( salucci & burkert 2000 ) and to massive elliptical ( borriello , salucci & danese 2003 , hereafter bsd ) galaxies . by adopting the burkert profile",
    " which has a large , low - density core ",
    "we are favoring data over theory , since @xmath3-body simulations of gravitational clustering imply dark - matter densities that increase roughly as a power law inside of the halo virial radius ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ; moore et al .",
    "1998 ; merritt et al .",
    "rotation curve studies , on the other hand , are generally interpreted as implying low ( @xmath39 ) dark matter densities within the region ( @xmath40 pc ) where the rotation curves are sampled ( e.g. burkert 1995 ; salucci & burkert 2000 ; de blok & bosma 2002 ; gentile et al .",
    "it was to model these low observed dark matter densities that the burkert model ( [ rhodm ] ) was postulated .    at large radii ,",
    "the burkert profile is similar to the nfw and moore profiles that are commonly fit to @xmath3-body haloes , i.e. @xmath41 . in the central regions where the two sorts of profile ( core vs. power law ) differ , the gravitational potential is dominated by the luminous galaxy .",

    "these integrals were rewritten using an appropriate change of variables ( see appendix [ potcons ] ) in order to reduce the complexity of their numerical treatment .",
    "the mass contained in the ellipsoid of semi - axes @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 is @xmath64 this implies that the total mass is @xmath65 . in the case of luminous and dark matter , respectively , equation  ( [ mw ] ) gives ( see fig .",

    "we cut off the dark matter grid at @xmath70 , where @xmath71 was determined by the requirement that the mass in dark matter was ten times greater than the luminous total mass .",

    ". intrinsic , short - to - long axis ratios of bright ( @xmath78 ) elliptical galaxies appear to be narrowly clustered around @xmath79 ( tremblay & merritt 1996 ) ; the constraints on the second axis ratio are less strong , but most studies ( e.g. tremblay & merritt 1995 ) find that axisymmetric shapes can be securely ruled out .",
    "we accordingly fixed the short - to - long axis ratio of the luminous component to be @xmath80 in all of the models and assumed `` maximal triaxiality , '' i.e. @xmath81    for the dark matter , we investigated three choices for the axis ratios : equal to those of the luminous matter ( mod1 ) ; a more prolate shape ( @xmath82 ) with @xmath83 ( mod2 ) ; and a more oblate shape ( @xmath84 ) with @xmath85 ( mod3 ) the parameters of the models are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",

    "it follows that @xmath94 for mod1 , @xmath95 for mod2 and @xmath96 for mod3 .",
    "hereafter we express all quantities in units such that @xmath97 , @xmath72 and @xmath35 are equal to unity .",
    "the implied unit of time is @xmath98 and @xmath99 is the unit of velocity ; the , derived , energy unit is @xmath100 .",
    "the orbital catalogs were built as in schwarzschild ( 1993 ) .",
    "initial conditions consisted either of zero initial velocity ( `` stationary '' start - space ) , or points in the @xmath101 plane with @xmath102 and @xmath103 ( @xmath101 start - space ) .",
    "as argued by schwarzschild ( 1993 ) , these choices cover most of the orbital types in the full phase space of a nonrotating triaxial model ; in particular , orbits starting in the @xmath101 plane are mostly tubes and avoid a region around the center of the model , while orbits starting on an equipotential surface are either stochastic or regular boxlets , that approach the origin after a sufficiently long time . for each galactic model we fixed @xmath104 energy values and for each value we selected a set of @xmath105 initial conditions from the @xmath101 start - space and a set of @xmath106 initial conditions from the stationary start - space , thus obtaining a catalog of @xmath107 orbits .",
    "each orbit was integrated in time using a @xmath108 order runge - kutta - fehlberg algorithm with a variable step size so as to have a relative error in energy less than @xmath109 per time step .",
    "particular care must be given to the choice of the orbital integration time . because our aim is to construct a stationary model of a galaxy , all orbits must be integrated over a time interval long enough to guarantee a steady - state galaxy model .",
    "this means that the occupation numbers @xmath110 of each orbit in the grid cells must be time - invariant .",
    "the time required by the @xmath110 to converge to stationary values varies from one orbit to another , whether the orbit is regular or stochastic .",
    "in fact , a regular orbit can fill its invariant torus in a short time or , in the case of a nearly resonant orbit , it can take much longer to fill it ( merritt & valluri 1999 ) . in the same way , some chaotic orbits diffuse rapidly in the entire phase - space permitted by their energy , while others remain confined between regular tori for a very long time ( valluri & merritt 2000 ) ( we will call _ ergodic _ the orbits with convergent @xmath110 ) .",
    "to select the integration time for the orbits we followed an iterative procedure , proposed by pfenniger ( 1984 ) , that stops the integration when the relative variations of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , in a time step go below @xmath111 . in detail , we proceeded as follows :    * integrate and store the @xmath24 and @xmath25 over a time @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the  dynamical time , \" defined for each given energy as the period of the @xmath114 resonant orbit in the @xmath115 plane ( see mf96 ) ; * restart the integration for another time @xmath116 , and store the new @xmath24 and @xmath25 at the end ; * compare the new and old @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "if the maximum relative difference is greater than @xmath117 then average the two sets of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , double @xmath116 and repeat step 2 , otherwise stop the computation .    as argued by pfenniger ,",
    "this method does not converge for all orbits ( e.g. `` sticky '' chaotic orbits ) , so it is needed to fix a maximum time of integration , @xmath118 .",
    "we set this value at @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the hubble time ; the choice @xmath121 means @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the time unit in eq .",

    "we used the plexus cluster at the rochester institute of technology to carry out the integrations .",
    "the construction of the complete library of 10944 orbits for mod1 required approximately 6 hours using in parallel 16 nodes of the cluster .",
    "the main result of this work is that we were able to succesfully construct self - consistent models in all of the cases considered for the shape of the dm halo . to obtain the model with the prolate shape of the dark matter distribution ( mod3 ) we needed to enlarge the catalog of orbits to @xmath127 . for each matter component",

    ", it is noted that , to guarantee the prolate structure of the dark matter in mod2 , the fraction of outer orbits was greater than that of the short tubes , while the opposite was true in mod3 , the more oblate model .    to give a finer detail on the self - consistent model orbital structure , fig .",

    "we stored the velocities along an orbit symmetrizing them respect to the principal axes in order to insert the point in which one velocity is evaluated in a precise cell of the positive octant . in this way an orbit , starting with a fixed direction , correspond to a trajectory covered equally ( or similar ) in two opposite directions .",

    "the difference in the external region is mainly due to insufficient orbital sampling and the ( necessary ) cut - off in the dark matter distribution .",
    "the schwarzschild method for building self - consistent models uses orbits as  templates \" , with supposedly time - invariant properties , so a requirement for a stationary solution is that a large fraction of the orbits ( whether regular or chaotic ) have nearly time - independent occupation numbers . using the method of pfenniger discussed above , we found that , at the time @xmath144 , roughly @xmath145 of the occupation numbers of the orbits used to represent the luminous component were not yet fixed in time , while for the dark matter this percentage was as high as @xmath146 .",
