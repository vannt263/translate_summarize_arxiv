    "the projected radial stellar density in each concentric circle was obtained by dividing the number of stars in each annulus by its area .",
    "the error bars are derived assuming that the number of stars in each annulus follow poisson statistics . to account for the contribution from the field stars , we selected a control field ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) which is @xmath53 to the east of iras 07141 - 0920 source . figure 2 shows the radial density profile of the cluster ( open circles ) and the horizontal dashed line shows field star density estimated from the control field .",
    "a clear gradient in surface number density distribution of sh2 - 294 region confirms the existence of clustering around the center of the region .",
    "several studies have shown that the radial density profiles of young embedded clusters can be fitted by both the inverse radius ( @xmath54 ) model and the king s model ( e.g. horner et al .",
    "1997 ; teixeira et al . 2004 ; baba et al .",
    "2004 ) . neglecting the tidal radius ,",
    "the king s profile can be written as    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the core radius ( the radius at which the surface density falls to half of the central density @xmath57 ) and @xmath58 is the constant for background offset due to field stars .",
    "for the sh2 - 294 cluster , we found that the king s model has a better fit ( reduced @xmath59 = 0.96 ) as compared to ` @xmath54 ' model ( reduced @xmath59 = 1.04 ) . within errors ,",

    "the peak of the projected stellar density distribution was found to be @xmath49 , @xmath64 , which is close ( 6@xmath28 ) to the position found by convolving a gaussian kernel as discussed above .",
    "the king s profile fitting yields a central density of 44 @xmath4 13 stars / arcmin@xmath63 ( @xmath5 22 stars / pc@xmath65 ) , correlates well with @xmath5 22 stars / pc@xmath63 of the peak of ssnd .",
    "the clustering in the central region is more obvious in the surface density map .",
    "however , there is evidence that sh2 - 294 possesses distinct substructures .",
    "the substructures in the east and northwest directions indicate the density enhancement , which can also be seen as a second peak in radial density distribution around @xmath66 from the central peak ( see fig .",
    "the eastern substructure is roughly spherical in shape and more prominent with peak approximately at @xmath67 and @xmath68 , having central density of 13 stars / pc@xmath65 .",
    "this substructure is at a distance of @xmath5 1.23@xmath69 from the cluster center of sh2 - 294 region and is also located beyond the faintest nebulosity associated with the central cluster seen in the 2mass @xmath47 band image .",

    "the direct method , however , can not be easily applied because the intrinsic colors of most of the stars are usually unknown , so that an indirect way of statistical approach can be adopted on the basis of number of stars detected in the investigated region .",
    "it has been shown by chini and wargau ( 1990 ) that two color diagrams ( tcds ) of the form of @xmath99 vs. @xmath100 , where @xmath29 is one of the wavelengths of the broad - band filters @xmath101 , provide an effective method of separating the abnormal extinction arising within such clusters from the normal extinction produced by general ism .",

    "here we would like to mention that the value of @xmath103 obtained by using equation ( 2 ) should be considered as an approximate estimation of @xmath108 in the cluster region .    to further test the reddening and @xmath1 value , we used the observed properties of ionizing source and assumed that the spectral type of the star is b0 v. the observed @xmath82 magnitude of the ionizing star is 14.04 with @xmath83 = 1.04 . comparing with intrinsic colors of johnson et al .",
    "( 1966 ) , the reddening @xmath94 to the star corresponds to 1.35 mag .",

    "an assumed sound speed ( @xmath175 ) of 11.4 ( 4.0 ) km @xmath147 in the ionized gas of density 10@xmath171 @xmath160 yields dynamical age of @xmath5 1.5 ( 4.2 ) @xmath140 yr , whereas in the lower density medium ( for example 10@xmath63 @xmath160 ) the above velocity range will yield @xmath5 0.4 ( 1.2 ) @xmath140 yr .",
    "however the uncertainty in age estimation can not be ignored because of the assumption of a uniform medium and also the velocity of expansion changes with time .",
    "one would then expect an expanding if to be preceded by a swept - up shell of cool neutral gas as it erodes into a neutral cloud .",
    "we have detected a half ring of msx dust emission towards the eastern part of hii region which is an indication that neutral gas surrounds the ionized gas .",
    "triggered star formation is a sequential process , in which star formation at the interface between hii regions and molecular clouds can be triggered by the ionization or shock fronts produced by massive stars .",
    "the mechanisms mainly responsible for triggered star formation have been discussed such as : the  radiation driven implosion \" ( rdi ) and the  collect - and - collapse \" model . in the rdi model",
    ", the expanding ionization front compresses the pre - existing molecular clumps , leading to density enhancements , which when it exceeds the local critical mass , collapses to form new stars ( lefloch & lazareff 1994 ; gorti & hollenbach 2002 ) . in the  collect - and - collapse \" model",
    ", the neutral material accumulates between the ionization front of the hii region and the shock front in the neutral gas .",
    "this compressed , shocked material may be dynamically unstable on a short internal - crossing time scale , leading to the formation of cometary globules and bright rims ( garcia - segura & franco 1996 ) or the compressed layer may become gravitationally unstable along its surface , on a long time scale ( elmegreen & lada 1977 ; zavagno et al .",
    "2006 ) , leading to the formation of massive fragments forming massive stars and/or clusters .    the cm diagrams ( fig .",
    "8) indicate that ionizing source may have a maximum age of @xmath176 yr .",
    "it is rather difficult to estimate the age of the cluster associated with ` region a ' as it has no optical counterpart and has poor statistics , however the age to the ` region a ' can be assigned on the basis of the age of ctt stars .",
    "the life time of ctts ranges from a few @xmath177 to few @xmath140 yr .",
    "the ` region a ' contains two ctt stars and their positions in intrinsic @xmath116 vs. @xmath45 cm diagram suggest an age of @xmath178 yr .",
    "however , this age should be considered as an approximate estimation because of uncertainty in determination of extinction as well as error in colors .",
    "on the basis of the fraction of nir excess stars ( cf .  4.6.1 ) , an age of @xmath5 1@xmath167 yr can also be assigned to the ` region a ' .",
    "if we assume that the distance between the ionizing star and the young stars in the ` region a ' is closed to a projected distance of @xmath5 1.8 pc ( 1.3@xmath69 ) and that the ionization front expands at a sound speed of 4.0 ( 11.4 ) km s@xmath21 , it would take approximately 4.6 ( 1.7 ) @xmath17 @xmath179 yr to reach the surface of the cloud and can induce second generation stars at the border .",
    "the protostellar phase in the clouds last for @xmath180 yr .",
    "therefore , the age difference between the young sources in ` region a ' and central ionizing source , keeping in mind the uncertainty in assigning the ages to the clusters , seems to be consistent with the hypothesis that star formation at the border may be due to rdi process .",
    "however , the possibility of `` collect - and - collapse '' process can not also be ruled out by considering the following evidence .",
    "the radio observation reveals that sh2 - 294 is a roughly spherically ionized region and is surrounded by half ring of msx dust emission in the mid - ir ( see fig .",
    "the ring is enhanced in the middle of the arc of dust emission .",
    "we found a msx point source at the center of dust peak .",
    "the presence of dust ring beyond the if indicates that the neutral gas surrounds the hii region .",
    "an embedded cluster ( ` region a ' ) is associated with the dust ring within 2mass detection limit and its central density lies close to the position of msx point source , satisfying most of the predictions proposed by the deharveng et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for star formation to occur at the border due to `` collect - and - collapse '' model .",
    "for example the morphology of sh2 - 294 region is almost similar to the selected hii candidates by deharveng et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , which are likely to be examples of star formation at the border by this process .",
    "however to look for the distribution of dense fragments around the sh2 - 294 , as seen in case of rcw 79 ( zavagno et al .",
    "2006 ) , one needs millimeter observations .",
    "the fact that the dynamical age of hii region is of @xmath5 1.5@xmath167 yr , comparable to the age of the stars associated to the ` region a ' and the presence of a zams b1.5 star further supports the formation of massive star following the collapse of thin shell of neutral matter , as predicted by `` collect - and - collapse '' model .    with the existing observations and data , it will be early to establish or rule out either of the scenarios . to provide a conclusive answer to the above mentioned star formation scenarios in sh2 - 294",
    "we need deep optical and nir observations , co , as well as millimeter observations .",
    "in this paper we provide the first global view of star formation around sh2 - 294 region .",
    "our multiwavelength data provides a detailed insight into distribution and nature of the young stellar objects as well as into the morphology of the thermal ionized gas and dust emissions .",
    "based on the 2mass data , we identify a star cluster at the center of sh2 - 294 and a distinct group of reddened stars ( small cluster ) located at 1.8 pc to the east of sh2 - 294 .",
    "the optical and near - infrared color - color and color - magnitude diagrams have been constructed to estimate the ratio of total - to - selective extinction , reddening , distance and spectral types of young stellar objects .",
    "the narrow band imaging in h@xmath7 and radio continuum map based on gmrt observation at 1280 mhz have been used to trace the ionized gas , which show interesting morphological details , including an arc - shaped structure in southeast direction and creation of lower density zones in the northwest direction through which the ionized gas can escape .",
    "we identified the most luminous member of the cluster situated at the center of the ionized gas and derived its spectral type which is consistent with an @xmath5 b0 main sequence star .",
    "the number of lyman continuum photons from the radio flux suggests that this single star is responsible for the ionization of the nebula .",
    "the pdr at the interface between the ionized gas and the molecular cloud is traced to the southeast direction by half ring of pah feature in msx and diffuse h@xmath15 emission . the morphological correlation between ionized gas , pdr and h@xmath15 emission leads us to conclude that there is a high degree of interaction of uv photons from b0 star with the nearby molecular cloud in north eastern direction .",
    "the small cluster is found at the peak of dust ring .",
    "the spatial distribution of the ysos ( class ii sources , sources detected in @xmath46 and @xmath47 bands and only in @xmath47 band ) indicates that the region around a small cluster is less evolved and suggests that the star formation activity observed at the border of sh2 - 294 region is possibly triggered by the expansion of hii region .",
