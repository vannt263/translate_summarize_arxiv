    "the compound cenige@xmath0 , crystallizing in the orthorhombic smnige@xmath0 type structure,@xcite is an antiferromagnetically ordered kondo lattice with the nel temperature @xmath2  =  5.5  k and the characteristic kondo temperature @xmath3  @xcite . upon applying hydrostatic pressure",
    ", @xmath2 increases up to about 8  k at @xmath4  3  gpa , rapidly decreases at higher pressure , and finally is suppressed to zero at a  critical pressure @xmath5  5.5  gpa .",
    "most importantly , around this quantum critical point the compound becomes superconducting below about 0.48  k. analysis of the temperature variation of its electrical resistivity in the normal state revealed an unconventional nature of the superconductivity in cenige@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite more detailed investigations of the compound showed that the superconductivity emerges in cenige@xmath0 not only in the critical region , but also deeply in the antiferromagnetically ordered phase , forming two distinct superconducting domes on the @xmath6 phase diagram , located around @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) measurements revealed that the onset of the superconductivity is in both domes a consequence of the presence of the @xmath9 electrons of cerium .",
    "@xcite    ynige@xmath0 was used in our previous studies as an isostructural non - magnetic counterpart to cenige@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite the temperature dependencies of its magnetic susceptibility , electrical resistivity and specific heat ( measured down to 1.7 , 1.5 and 1.8  k , respectively ) showed the yttrium phase to be a simple metal with nearly temperature - independent magnetic susceptibility .",
    "in the course of our investigations of the ce@xmath10y@xmath11nige@xmath0 alloys ( to be published elsewhere ) we have reinvestigated the electrical resistivity and the specific heat of ynige@xmath0 down to 0.36  k. here we report on a superconducting phase transition found in this compound .",
    "polycrystalline sample of ynige@xmath0 was prepared by conventional arc melting the stoichiometric amounts of the elemental components ( y 3n , ni 3n , ge 5n ) in protective atmosphere of an argon glove box .",
    "the pellet was subsequently wrapped in a molybdenum foil , sealed in an evacuated silica tube , and annealed at 800@xmath12c for one week .",
    "quality of the product was verified by means of x - ray powder diffraction and microprobe analysis , which both showed that the sample was a single phase .",
    "rietveld refinement of the x - ray powder pattern confirmed that ynige@xmath0 crystallizes in the smnige@xmath0 type structure with the lattice parameters @xmath13  =  4.060(1 )   , @xmath14  =  21.529(2 )   , @xmath15  =  4.063(3 )   , being close to those reported previously.@xcite the energy dispersive x - ray analysis of randomly chosen areas on the sample surface resulted in the average composition : y  25(1)at.% , ni  18(1)at.% and ge ",
    "57(1)at.% , that corresponds to the formula y@xmath16ni@xmath17ge@xmath18 .",
    "the deviation from the nominal composition may be attributed to the fact , that the analysis was performed using internal standards of the spectrometer .",
    "physical properties of the compound were studied using a commercial quantum design ppms platform , in temperature range 0.36300  k and in magnetic fields up to 500  oe , generated by a standard 9  t magnet .",
    "the resistivity was measured by a conventional four point ac technique on a bar - shaped sample with electrical contacts made of silver epoxy paste .",
    "as a function of temperature .",
    "the arrow marks the critical temperature @xmath19 and the solid lines serve as guides for the eye .",
    "the inset : evolution of the superconducting phase transition upon applying magnetic field @xmath20 ; the values of @xmath20 are nominal . ]",
    "figure  [ f1 ] presents the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity @xmath21 of ynige@xmath0 in a semi - logarithmic scale .",
    "the overall behaviour of @xmath22 is similar to that reported previously :  @xcite upon cooling down , @xmath21 decreases in a simple metallic manner and saturates below about 10  k. the resistivity remains constant down to the temperature of about 0.50  k , below which a rapid drop of @xmath21 clearly manifests the onset of superconductivity , with the critical temperature @xmath19  =  0.46  k. small width of the phase transition , which is less than 8% of @xmath19 , points at a bulk character of the superconductivity .",
    "presence of a distinct anomaly , that appears in the temperature variation of the specific heat @xmath23 of ynige@xmath0 just below @xmath19  =  0.46  k ( fig .  [ f2 ] ) , seems to support the presumption on the intrinsic nature of the superconducting state .",
    "nevertheless , low - temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements are needed to unambiguously confirm the bulk character of the superconducting state in the compound studied .     measured in several different magnetic fields @xmath20 ; the values of @xmath20 are nominal .",
    "the solid curves serve as guides for the eye and the arrow marks the critical temperature . ]    as seen in the insets to figs .",
    "[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] , the superconducting state in ynige@xmath0 is very sensitive on the strength of the magnetic field applied . upon increasing field , @xmath19 inferred from the @xmath22 curve systematically decreases and already at 500  oe the drop of @xmath21 is out of the investigated temperature range .",
    "similar behaviour is visible in the specific heat , yet the anomaly in @xmath24 quickly broadens with increasing @xmath20 and therefore it is hardly visible on the experimental curve already in 70  oe . due to low resolution of the magnet used in our experiments ( the remanent field was of the order of 1020 oe ) , we were not able to construct and reliably analyse the @xmath25 phase diagram for ynige@xmath0 . nevertheless , based on the electrical resistivity measurements one can estimate the critical field value @xmath26 to be of the order of 500  oe .",
    "the small value of @xmath27 is characteristic of conventional , bcs - like superconductors .",
    "however , the observed jump of the specific heat , @xmath28 , is in ynige@xmath0 of about 0.50(5 ) ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) , which is well below @xmath28",
    "=  1.43 expected for an @xmath29-wave bcs superconductor .",
    "such a distinct deviation of the specific heat jump from the bcs value hints at possible unconventional character of the superconducting state .",
    "for example , in yba@xmath30cu@xmath0o@xmath31 , which is one of the best known high-@xmath19 superconductors , @xmath28 is of about 2,@xcite while in the multi - valued gap superconductor mgb@xmath30 the jump in @xmath24 is only 0.82.@xcite the recently reported noncentrosymmetric strongly - coupled superconductor mo@xmath0al@xmath30c has @xmath32 equal to 2.28.@xcite",
    "the compound ynige@xmath0 was found to exhibit an ambient - pressure superconductivity below @xmath1  =  0.46  k , which is close to the maximal @xmath19 evidenced in cenige@xmath0 around the quantum critical point.@xcite in this context it is worth noting that substitution of ce by y results in 6%-reduction of the unit cell volume of the system , which can be roughly considered as equivalent to high hydrostatic pressure .",
    "therefore , the finding of the superconductivity in ynige@xmath0 , which does not contain @xmath33-electrons , may shed new light on the character of the superconductivity in the isostructural cenige@xmath0 compound .",
