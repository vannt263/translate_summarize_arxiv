    "classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) are young ( the age @xmath5 yr ) , low mass @xmath6 pre - main sequence stars , activity of which is caused by magnetospheric accretion of matter from a protoplanetary disc .",
    "an optical spectrum of ctts consists of photospheric spectrum of late type star and emission lines with non - trivial and variable profiles . generally speaking ,",
    "ctts s emission lines consist of two components : a narrow ( @xmath7 kms@xmath8 ) and a broad @xmath9 kms@xmath8 ) , which are formed in different spatial regions ",
    "see e.g. batalha et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , dodin et al .",
    ". flux ratio of these components is different for different lines , varies from star to star and with time for the same line .",
    "it has been known since joy ( 1949 ) that depths and equivalent widths of photospheric lines in t tauri stars spectra are smaller than those of main - sequence stars of the same spectral type .",
    "this effect is used to explain as the result of superposition of continuum emission onto photospheric spectrum .",
    "the degree of veiling of ctts s photospheric absorption lines in some spectral band can be characterized by value @xmath10 averaged over lines of that regin , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are equivalent widths of photospheric lines in spectra of ctts and template star of the same spectral type respectively .",
    "line and continuum emission observed in ctts s spectra can be explained as follows in the frame of magnetospheric accretion model ( knigl , 1991 ; lamzin , 1995 ) . the matter from the inner disk",
    "is frozen in the stellar magnetic field lines and slides down along them toward the star , being accelerated by gravity .",
    "having reached the dense layers of the stellar atmosphere , matter is decelerated in the accretion shock ( as ) , converting into the heat the main part of its kinetic energy , the flux of which is equal to @xmath13 where @xmath0 , @xmath1 are pre - shock gas number density and velocity , @xmath14 is the average molecular weight , @xmath15 is the proton mass .",
    "the hot postshock matter cools down gradually radiating its thermal energy in the uv and x - ray spectral bands and settles down to the stellar surface .",
    "one half of the short - wavelength radiation flux of the shock from the cooling zone irradiates the star , producing so - called hot spot on its surface , and the second half escapes upward , heating and ionizing the pre - shock gas .",
    "calculations show , that pre - shock gas temperature does not exceed 20000 k at a typical velocity @xmath16 kms@xmath8 , however there are ions up to o@xmath17 in this region ( lamzin , 1998 ) .    assuming that ctts s emission continuum is formed in the hot spot , calvet and gullbring ( 1998 )",
    "have calculated the structure of the atmosphere being irradiated by the short - wave radiation of the accretion shock without any allowance for the emission in lines . however it was discovered later that photospheric lines in spectra of some cttss were filled in by the narrow emission lines ( petrov et al . , 2001 ;",
    "gham et al .",
    ", 2008 ; petrov et al . , 2011 ) , which were apparently formed in the hot spot and which in addition to continuum reduce the depth of a photospheric lines .",
    "this phenomenon leads for example to a variability of the radial velocity of photospheric lines and/or to a non - monotonic spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the veiling continuum ( stempels and piskunov , 2003 ) , if to derive it by means of eq.([er - definit ] ) .",
    "the calculations of the thermal structure and sed of the hot spot with allowance for the lines as well as the continuum for the first time have been performed by dodin and lamzin ( 2012 ) in lte - approach .",
    "the calculations were performed for various sets of a parameters characterizing the star ( @xmath18 @xmath19 ) and an accretion shock ( @xmath2 @xmath1 ) with solar element abundance .",
    "it was assumed that there was one circular spot at stellar surface , within which @xmath1 and @xmath0 were constant .",
    "we calculated how the resulting spectra of a star with @xmath20 from 3750 to 5000 k @xmath21 a spot should looks like at different relative sizes of the spot @xmath22 and its positions relative to the earth , characterized by the angle @xmath23 between the line of sight and spot s axis of symmetry .",
    "for each of the stars in which veiling by lines was found ( gahm et al .",
    "2008 ; petrov et al .",
    "2011 ) , we were able to select a model with a spectrum similar to the observed one , at least in the sense that the lines exhibiting an emission feature in the observed spectra also exhibit emission features in the models .",
    "thus , it was shown that the most strong emission lines being formed in the spot appeared in the spectra of ctts as narrow components of emission lines , while more weak emission lines decreased the depth of respective photospheric lines .",
    "however a quantitative comparison of simulated and observed spectra revealed a number of problems : there were not emission lines in some ctts s spectra predicted by the models ; theoretical spectra did not reproduce observed intensity ratio of hei and heii lines ; the predicted intensity of cai emission lines was so much greater than observed that dodin and lamzin ( 2012 ) suggested a substantial depletion of ca in the accreted gas .",
    "however , the authors supposed that assumptions taken in the modeling were more probable reason of the discrepancy .",
    "first of all it is lte - approach , because , as noted sakhibullin ( 1997 ) , the intensity of emission lines is usually smaller in non - lte spectra .",
    "it will be shown below that if to derive level populations and ionization degree of he and ca from statistical equilibrium equations instead of boltzmann and saha equations , then the agreement between the theory and observations becames much better for a number of cases .",
    "we , as well as dodin and lamzin ( 2012 ) , consider only narrow components of emission lines , which are formed in the post - shock zone , where a problem of radiative transfer can be treated in the plane - parallel approximation .",
    "broad components of ctts s emission lines in one way or another are formed in several regions : in the pre - shock hii zone , in the region near truncation radius , where disk matter is freezes in magnetic field lines of the star as well as in ctts s outflow .",
    "hydrogen lines are example of the lines , in which the broad component usually dominates .",
    "a simulation of an intensity and profiles of emission lines broad component is much more complicated problem , which suggests simultaneous solution of 3-d mhd equations and 3-d radiative transfer  see , for instance , kurosawa and romanova ( 2012 ) and references therein .",
    "the software for the calculations of helium ionization degree and level populations was developed by ourself .",
    "the selection of atomic levels ( so - called the atomic model ) that we used in our calculations is described in the appendix .",
    "the region behind the shock front can be divided into two regions for convenience : the post - shock cooling zone , which is transparent to x - ray and ultraviolet radiations of the cooling gas , and the hot spot , i.e. the stellar atmosphere , where this radiation is absorbed .",
    "distributions of the temperature @xmath24 and the number density over the post - shock cooling zone were taken from lamzin s paper ( 1998 ) for the parameters @xmath25 kms@xmath8 and @xmath26 the distributions of the same parameters in the hot spot for the same values of @xmath27 @xmath0 and for various parameters of an undisturbed atmosphere of the star were calculated by dodin and lamzin ( 2012 ) .    the spectrum of the hot spot is mainly determined by the parameter @xmath28 ( calvet and gullbring , 1998 ; dodin and lamzin , 2012 ) , which equals to the ratio of the flux @xmath29 of the accretion energy ",

    "the choice of the ion and the principal quantum numbers for the figure is due to the fact that heii 4686  line will be actively used to determine accretion flow parameters . in order to display on the figure only the regions with a noticeable abundance of heii",

    "we will describe only which atomic data were used and how the system of equations was solved .",

    "velocity gradients were not taken into account when we calculated line s optical depth @xmath43 because in regions with @xmath67 helium atoms thermal velocity is a few times larger than the velocity of the gas inflow , including the region of heii resonance lines formation .",

    "hot spot s @xmath85 dependence that we calculated in lte approximation probably overestimate true one at rosseland optical depths @xmath86 ( dodin and lamzin , 2012 ) .",
    "however if the level populations and the ionization degree are basically determined by radiative processes , which depend weakly on the temperature , one can suppose that any probable deviations of @xmath87 from the true dependence do not influence significantly on level populations .    to test this hypothesis we compared ionization degrees as well as hei and heii level populations in the models calculated in the usual way with that of the models , where the temperature is set to be constant at @xmath88 and equals to @xmath89 .",

    "the behavior of the deviations is similar , but the relative difference was always smaller than 50% .",
    "the sensitivity of hei upper levels population to hot spot s thermal structure is caused by the fact that the population is controlled by electron collisions , rates of which strongly depend on gas temperature . moreover ,",
    "the collisional cross section for upper @xmath97 levels are poorly known .",
    "it is hard to say now how the deviation of @xmath98 dependence from the true one and the uncertainties in the collisional cross sections influence on the intensity of hei subordinate lines . due to these reasons we will not use these lines for diagnostic purposes .    on the other hand it appeared that sensitivity of he@xmath33 ion level population to thermal structure variations is relatively small : the differences in the populations between the basic models and models with various @xmath99",
    "do not exceed a few percents .",
    "we emphasize that the problems with the populations of excited levels of hei do not influence on the ionization balance of hei - heii , because in our case more than 99% of hei atoms are on the ground level @xmath100 thus in the case of heii we can carry out the non - lte calculations with the lte - structure of the atmosphere .",
    "we will see later that heii at 4686 line is very useful for a diagnostic of physical conditions in ctts s accretion zone .",
    "calcium lines in ctts optical spectra belong to cai and caii only .",
    "due to this reason we will consider here only the hot spot and an undisturbed stellar atmosphere because ca ions with the charge @xmath101 only exist in noticeable amount in post shock cooling zone . for cai and caii we will use the lte thermal structure for an undisturbed atmosphere , calculated with the atlas9 code , and hot spot models described by dodin and lamzin ( 2012 ) .",
    "thus we will suppose that changes in ca level populations due to the non - lte effects do not influence substantially on the opacity coefficient as far as abundance of calcium is small .",
    "we varied @xmath20 from 4000 to 5000  k , and assumed that @xmath102 or 4.0 . to reduce the number of free parameters we always assume that the microturbulence velocity @xmath103 kms@xmath8 .",

    "the new boundary condition for @xmath111 that takes into account an external radiation with an intensity @xmath112 is ( mihalas , 1978 ) : @xmath113 the intensity @xmath112 was calculated by an interpolation of the radiation , being formed in the cooling zone and calculated by dodin and lamzin ( 2012 ) , to a frequency grid , which is used in the detail code .    to verify the modified program we compared the radiation field , computed by detail , with the field , computed by atlas9 ( see dodin and lamzin , 2012 ) .",

    "we need to decrease pre - shock density @xmath2 but then the intensity of heii 4686 line became larger than the observed .",
    "this contradiction can be overcomed by assuming an inhomogeneity of the spot , namely , by assuming that the spot with high densities and velocities of the falling gas is surrounded by an accretion zone with lower values of @xmath0 and @xmath165    to illustrate it , we have calculated two - component spot s model for tw hya .",

    "a good repeatability of the parameters can be noted also for gm aur",
    ". the signal - to - noise ratio of bp tau spectra is relatively low , and due to this reason we can reliably determine @xmath0 value only , which in one case out of nine differs significantly from other . only for dn tau",
    "the temporal variations of the parameters were significant .",
    "it can be assumed that in this case the properties of the accretion stream were changed indeed , because these two spectra are visually differs from each other .",
    "it is generally recognised that emission spectrum of ctts is a consequence of a magnetospheric accretion of matter from a protoplanetary disk , but the spectrum has not been reproduced quantitatively until now .",
    "it raises doubts about the reliability of the existing estimates of the parameters of the accretion flow in ctts , general characteristics of young stars and the interstellar and/or circumstellar extinction @xmath306 for these objects .",
    "a simulation of ctts spectrum is complicated by the fact that most of emission lines consist of a narrow and a broad components , which are formed in regions with very different physical conditions , geometry and velocity field .",
    "the difference is so great that at a present day narrow and broad components of the emission lines are being modelled independently of each other .",
    "it introduces an uncertainty in a process of a comparison of simulated intensity and profiles of one component due to the _ a priori _ unknown contribution of the second .",
    "this problem is especially serious in the case of the broad components , because they are formed in a moving gas of the magnetosphere of ctts , therefore , separation of the components , which is used now , by means of a decomposition of the observed profile into a pair of gaussians can not be considered as a serious basis for a comparison of simulations with observations . in addition , the simulation of profiles of the broad component is a very laborious and multiparameter problem , which requires a simultaneous solution of 3-d radiation transfer and mhd equations ( kurosawa and romanova , 2012 ) .",
    "we have seen on an example of heii 4686 and caii lines that the broad component complicates comparison of the simulated spectrum of the hot spot with observations . at the same time , our calculations reproduce well profiles of the most lines of neutral metals , for instance cai .",
    "it means that the broad component is almost absent in these lines .",
    "if we reconstruct the spectrum of the hot spot by using such lines , then the profiles of the broad component can be found by substracting the simulated profiles from observed ones . in this paper",
    "such approach has allowed us for the first time to discover the broad component in heii 4686 line .    nevertheless , the main purpose of our modeling is to determine a shape of the accretion spot and distributions of the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 within it .",
    "moreover , the stellar parameters should be determined , namely : @xmath18",
    "@xmath307 @xmath274 @xmath215 and @xmath308 this problem can be solved by doppler imageing , using the dependence of @xmath309 calculated for as wide as possible spectral range for a comprehensive grid of the parameters .",
    "calculations , performed by dodin and lamzin ( 2012 ) , and in this work are the first steps in solution of this problem .",
    "a good agreement with observations allows to trust to the conclusion that the most of considered stars accretes matter with pre - shock gas density @xmath310 @xmath311 although this conclusion we obtained in the framework of the homogeneous circular spot model .",
    "our @xmath0 value found for tw hya coincides with an estimation of kastner et al .",
    "( 2002 ) derived from x - ray observations , but in the case of bp tau schmitt et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found @xmath0 an order of magnitude smaller than our value .",
    "it turns out that at such density the spectrum of cai as well as of other metals are close to lte . taking into account a simplicity of our model , it is difficult to say about a reliability of our conclusion about a depletion of calcium in the falling gas in case of tw hya .",
    "however , tw hya is older than other considered stars in a few times , therefore the depletion of calcium in the falling gas due to its accumulation in heavy grains is possible exactly for this star .",
    "for further progress in the mapping of ctts s accretion spots the following should be done .",
    "\\1 ) the appropriate observational data should be prepared . at the beginning all available spectra of ctts",
    "should be carefully processed : recall that we used spectra after automatic processing in this study .",
    "the simulated spectra have been compared with spectra , which were normalized to continuum level for each echelle order , therefore the obtained results do not depend on the interstellar reddening .",
    "a good agreement of observed spectra with simulated ones , for which @xmath312 dependence is known , means that we know stellar spectrum , undistorted by interstellar reddening .",
    "hence if we obtain from observations @xmath199 dependence , then we could find not only @xmath313 but also try to derive the dependence @xmath314 if the dependence @xmath199 is obtained in absolute units , then we could also find luminosity and radius of a star .",
    "\\2 ) non - lte structure of upper layers of the hot spot should be calculated .",
    "it will allow to calculate more accurately an emission spectrum of hei as well as of hydrogen . by the way",
    ", we calculated the non - lte spectrum of hydrogen , but not used in the diagnostics due to two reasons : at first , profiles of balmer lines are dominated by the broad component and secondly , the hydrogen lines are formed exactly in the upper layers of the hot spot .    before this work we have belived that narrow component of h and he ,",
    "in contrast to ca , are formed equally in the hot spot and in a moving gas in the postshock cooling zone .",
    "for an uniform calculation of the level populations in regions with very different physical conditions we used the escape probability approach .",
    "however , it is clear now that the main flux of these lines are formed in the hot spot , therefore in the future the calculation of the level populations of he and h should be carried out just like for ca .",
    "\\3 ) to identify as many as possible lines in ctts spectra , which are sensitive to variation of accretion flux and stellar parameters : non - lte calculations should be carried out , at least , for fe , mg , ti and na . these lines will be used in the future for doppler mapping of ctts . for example it has been shown in this work that cai at 4226.7 resonance line is sensitive to spot s orientation relative an observer , while , at fixed veiling , the line of heii at 4686 and the lines of caii are sensitive to pre - shock gas density .",
    "\\4 ) x - ray and uv spectra of the accretion shock should be calculated for the parameters @xmath315 and @xmath316 kms@xmath317 i.e. larger than used by lamzin ( 1998 ) , because there are reasons to suppose that they may be necessary to model spectr of some ctts .",
    "\\5 ) lines of some important molecules , which have not been included yet in our simulation of spectra , should be added , for instance , tio , because the molecular lines are typical for late type stars .",
    "what is more in addition to the hot spot , cold spots may also present on the surface of ctts ( donati et al . ,",
    "2011 ) .",

    "thus , 66 energy levels were included in our model , however at the calculation of the level population , the levels of hei with @xmath320 and heii with @xmath321 were combined into the superlevels . a relatively small number of the levels in the model is primarily caused by the lack of precise values of rate coefficients for collisional excitation and ionization from upper levels . in other words",
    ", it is reasonable to assume that the increase in accuracy due to a larger number of levels will be compensated by low quality of the atomic data for these levels .",
    "sublevels of hei and heii superlevels assumed to be populated according to the boltzmann distribution . due to this reason it was not necessary to consider electron transitions within the superlevel .",
    "transitions between the superlevel @xmath106 and other levels @xmath322 of the atom are taken into account by effective transition rates @xmath323 which were obtained by averaging of transition rates @xmath324 from a sublevel @xmath325 to level @xmath322 over the boltzmann distribution for the sublevels @xmath325 .",
    "transition rates from the levels @xmath322 to the sublevels @xmath325 of the superlevel @xmath106 are calculated by a simple summation .",
    "this approach is fully justified at the high density in an accretion column : test calculation without the combination of the levels leads to the same results and shows that the upper levels are indeed populated according to the boltzmann distribution .    to get a sense of the influence of the number of levels , taken into account in hei and heii ,",
    "on the accuracy of the results , we used the cloudy08 code ( ferland et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "as was noted in sect.1 the cloudy08 code and our calculations give similar results for a model of a homogeneous slab with parameters similar to the parameters of the gas in the formation region of hei and heii lines : @xmath74  k , @xmath326 @xmath311 slab thickness @xmath73 cm , blackbody radiation field with @xmath74  k and a dilution factor @xmath75    at first we have calculated , using the model of the slab , the optical depth of a few lines of hei and heii in the case of the atomic model , which included 7 levels for hei and 10 for heii .",
    "then we have repeated the calculation , but taking 17 levels for hei and 20 for heii .",
    "it appeared that relative difference in optical depths of various lines of heii with low level principal quantum number @xmath327 was about 0.5% . in the case of hei",
    "the difference for @xmath328 is less than 1% , and for @xmath34 it is about a few percents .",
    "analogous tests for the models with @xmath329 and @xmath330 @xmath4 have led to similar results and we concluded that the number of the levels in our atomic model was sufficient to solve the considered problem .",
