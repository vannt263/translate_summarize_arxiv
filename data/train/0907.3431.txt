    "these lectures were given at aligarh muslim university , aligarh india , at a nuclear physics workshop attended by indian graduate students and postdocs .",
    "these lectures provide a pedagogical review of the past 50 years of experimental and theoretical studies of the quark and gluon structure of the nucleon .",
    "since many speakers at this workshop will discuss structure functions extracted from deep inelastic scattering reactions , we define these quantities and review what can be extracted from them .",
    "we hope that specialists in this field will tolerate our brief and superficial summary of many years study of strongly - interacting systems .",
    "richard h. dalitz , 1925 - 2006.,width=115 ]    these lectures are dedicated to my mentor , richard dalitz , who was from 1963 - 2000 royal society professor of physics at oxford university and who made seminal contributions in particle phenomenology .",
    "dalitz pairs ( electron - positron pairs from decay of a high - energy photon ) and the dalitz plot were named after him .",
    "in addition he made important contributions to our understanding of strange particles and hypernuclei , and to particle spectroscopy through the constituent - quark model .",
    "i appreciated his insights into theoretical physics , his keen intuition about physical problems , and his encouragement of young physicists .",
    "the development of both accelerators and detectors progressed rapidly through the first half of the @xmath0 century @xcite .",
    "ernest lawrence s cyclotron ushered in a new era which provided both much higher beam energies and more intense beams than were previously possible .",
    "this was followed by the development of synchrotrons and mastery of magnetic focusing techniques , which allowed particles to be contained in a circular pipe surrounded by individual focusing magnets . shortly following world war ii , development began on a succession of machines based upon the synchrotron principle .",
    "advances in accelerator technology were accompanied by corresponding advances in particle detectors .",
    "the bubble chamber was an extremely important tool in discovering new particles .",
    "in particular strange particles like the @xmath1 and @xmath2 were discovered in bubble chambers .",
    "another major detector advance was the development of the spark chamber .",
    "most of the particles discovered before the 1950s were either completely stable ( so far as we know ) , like the electron or proton , or had relatively long lifetimes .",
    "for example , the lifetimes of charged pions and kaons are roughly @xmath3 seconds , and the lifetimes of the @xmath4 and charged @xmath5 are of order @xmath6 seconds . when charged ( neutral )",
    "particles move with sufficiently large velocities , they leave measurable tracks ( gaps ) in emulsions or bubble chambers between their production and decay vertices .    starting in the early 1950s , researchers began to discover states which were much more short - lived than these earlier particles .",
    "these states were extracted from scattering experiments at what were then the highest available energies .",
    "[ fig : pipxsect ] shows elastic and total cross sections for @xmath7 scattering .",
    "note the very prominent peak at cm energy just near 1.2 gev .",
    "this is what was then called the ` @xmath8 resonance ' in @xmath9 scattering .",
    "the notation for this state denoted the angular momentum ( the spectroscopic notation @xmath10 for @xmath11 ) , and the isospin @xmath12 and total spin @xmath13 in the notation @xmath14 . in current terminology",
    "this is the @xmath15 resonance @xcite . since the total width for this state is of order 100 mev then from the heisenberg uncertainty principle which can be written as @xmath16",
    ", we can infer that the lifetime of the @xmath15 is of order @xmath17 seconds .",

    "information about these resonances , and comparative ratings of the reliability of claimed resonant states , are compiled in the biennial report of the particle data group @xcite .      here is an elementary review of bound states and scattering resonances @xcite .",
    "consider a two - body scattering process ; for simplicity we will initially assume spinless non - relativistic particles in an @xmath18-wave state , interacting via a potential @xmath19 .",
    "for the time being we will consider two - body scattering in only the elastic channel . the radial wave function can be written as @xmath20 , and the radial schrdinger equation satisfied by @xmath21 for a given value of the relative momentum @xmath22 is - + u(r)_k(r ) = k^2_k(r ) [ eq : schrod ] in eq .",
    "( [ eq : schrod ] ) , @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the reduced mass of the two - body pair , and we adopt units where @xmath25 .",
    "strong interaction potentials are short - ranged , so we expect @xmath26 as @xmath27 . in this case at large @xmath28 we can write _ r  _ k(r ) = a(k ) e^-ikr + b(k ) e^ikr [ eq : psilim ] we can consider the wavefunction @xmath29 to be an analytic function of @xmath22 . a sufficiently strong attractive potential may support one or more bound states .",
    "these are confined states that decay exponentially .",
    "they will occur as discrete solutions of the schrdinger equation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : schrod ] ) corresponding to imaginary momentum @xmath30 . for this particular value of the momentum , the coefficient @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psilim ] ) must vanish ; in this case the wavefunction will decay exponentially at large distances ,  @xmath32 .",
    "the properties of bound states and resonances are related to the behavior of the scattering amplitude in the complex @xmath22 plane , or equivalently the complex @xmath33 plane .",
    "the non - relativistic relation between energy and momentum is e = k^2/(2 m ) + e_th [ eq : evsk ] from eq .",
    "( [ eq : evsk ] ) it is clear that as the phase of the complex variable @xmath22 varies from @xmath34 , the phase of @xmath33 will change from @xmath35 .",
    "thus one sheet of the complex @xmath22 plane will map onto two sheets of the complex @xmath33 plane .",
    "for the time being consider only the elastic channel ( inelastic channels will produce additional sheets of the complex @xmath33 plane ) .",
    "a bound state corresponds to a pole of the scattering amplitude @xmath36 in the complex @xmath22 plane at positive imaginary value @xmath37 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : evsk ] ) , bound state poles will appear on the real @xmath33 axis , below the continuum threshold @xmath38 .",
    "the upper sheet of the complex @xmath33 plane is called the physical sheet ( the shaded sheet on the left in fig .  [",
    "fig : ecmplx ] ) , and the lower sheet is an unphysical sheet .",
    "the two sheets are joined by a cut running along the positive real @xmath33 axis , beginning at continuum threshold .",
    "left : the complex @xmath33 plane , the physical sheet ( top , shaded ) and an unphysical sheet ( bottom ) .",
    "a cut runs along the real @xmath33 axis , beginning at continuum threshold .",
    "a resonance is shown as an x on the unphysical sheet .",
    "right : x - section vs.  energy for a breit - wigner resonance , whose amplitude is given by eq .",
    "( ) .,width=576 ]    if one crosses the cut starting from above , moving from the physical sheet onto the unphysical sheet , the @xmath39 matrix is continuous .",
    "however , @xmath39 is discontinuous if one crosses the cut beginning and remaining on the physical sheet .",
    "the discontinuity of the @xmath39 matrix across the cut plays an important role in constructing dispersion relations for the scattering amplitude @xcite .",
    "imagine that one has an attractive potential strong enough to produce a bound state . as one decreases the strength of the attractive potential , at some point it will no longer support a bound state .",
    "the bound state pole may move onto the second sheet of the complex @xmath33 plane and become a resonance .",
    "a resonance generally produces a peak in the scattering cross section at some energy above elastic threshold .",
    "the prototypical non - relativistic resonance amplitude was posited by breit and wigner @xcite , who wrote the scattering amplitude in the vicinity of the resonance in the form ( e ) = g(e)[e- m + i/2]^-1 [ eq : bw ] this leads to a peak in the cross section vs.  energy for @xmath40 , a so - called ` breit - wigner ' resonance . the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : ecmplx ] plots the qualitative features of the resulting cross section , which is proportional to the absolute square of the scattering amplitude .",
    "( [ eq : bw ] ) shows that the resulting cross section will have a peak at energy @xmath41 ; furthermore , if the quantity @xmath42 is relatively constant in the vicinity of the peak , then the full width at half maximum around the peak will be given by the quantity @xmath43 .",
    "so the location and width of the resonance peak are characterized by the two quantities @xmath44 and @xmath43 .",
    "( [ eq : bw ] ) shows that the scattering amplitude will have a pole in the complex plane at @xmath45 .",
    "the responance pole lies on the unphysical sheet of the complex @xmath33 plane , below the real @xmath33 axis , as indicated on the left in fig .",
    "[ fig : ecmplx ] .",
    "we can also examine the properties of resonances by defining the scattering or @xmath46-matrix @xcite .",
    "the @xmath39 matrix is defined as the amplitude of an outgoing wave solution , corresponding to a unit incoming wave .",
    "if we restrict ourself to the elastic channel , the relation between the @xmath46 and @xmath39 matrix is ( e ) & = & ; s(e ) = e^2i(e ) ; ( e ) = e^i(e)((e ) ) [ eq : smtrx ] unitarity requires that the @xmath18-matrix have absolute value one .",
    "an attractive ( repulsive ) potential tends to produce positive ( negative ) phase shifts . in a one - channel situation with a breit - wigner resonance , eq .",
    "( [ eq : bw ] ) shows that @xmath36 will be purely imaginary at the resonance position @xmath41 . by inspection of eq .",
    "( [ eq : smtrx ] ) , a purely imaginary @xmath39-matrix corresponds to @xmath47 .",
    "the location of an elastic resonance ( with no background ) is characterized by a phase shift of @xmath48 .     argand diagram . at low energies the @xmath39 matrix moves on the unitary circle .",
    "the phase @xmath49 at an elastic resonance .",
    "when inelastic channels open , the @xmath39 matrix moves inside the unitary circle.,width=288 ]    an argand diagram represents a convenient graphical way to study the behavior of the scattering amplitude , through a two - dimensional plot of the @xmath39 matrix vs.  energy .",
    "the horizontal axis is the real part of the @xmath39 matrix and the vertical axis is the imaginary part . for purely elastic scattering the @xmath39 matrix moves on a circle ( the unitary circle ) of radius @xmath50 centered at the point @xmath51 .",
    "the origin of the argand diagram corresponds to @xmath52 .",
    "the angle subtended by any point on the unitary circle ( relative to the origin ) is @xmath53 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : argand ] , which shows an argand diagram for @xmath54 scattering @xcite . for sufficiently low energies ,",
    "only the elastic channel is open , and the @xmath39 matrix moves on the unitary circle .",
    "the phase shift @xmath49 at the position of the @xmath55(980 ) resonance .",
    "the smaller the width @xmath43 , the faster the phase shift will move through the resonance .    at higher energies , inelastic channels open up .",
    "the complex @xmath33 plane must be expanded to include inelastic channels .",
    "every time an inelastic channel opens , a new cut appears on the real @xmath33 axis at the inelastic channel threshold , and new unphysical sheets appear . locating a scattering resonance",
    "becomes more difficult , as one must determine both the resonance position and the sheet on which it occurs . in the presence of inelastic channels the scattering amplitude becomes a matrix .",
    "the quantity @xmath56 is defined as the coefficient of an outgoing wave in channel @xmath57 corresponding to unit incoming wave in channel @xmath58 .",
    "unitarity requires that in the presence of inelastic channels , the elastic @xmath39 matrix element must lie inside the unitary circle , and fig .",
    "[ fig : argand ] demonstrates this .",
    "finding resonances in multichannel reactions is likely to rely on sophisticated fitting of scattering amplitudes , or on models that allow one to analytically continue the @xmath39 matrix in the complex @xmath33 plane .",
    "we should emphasize that the simple breit - wigner resonance is almost never observed in actual experiments .",
    "the @xmath59 resonance @xmath60(770 ) is one of the few examples where this simple resonance picture is valid @xcite . in most other cases",
    "the situation is far more complex .",
    "the goal in analyzing resonant reactions is to identify the location of the pole in the complex energy plane , as this pole is the fundamental dynamical quantity .      in the 1950s the catalog of resonances grew at first modestly , then exploded .",
    "from a few resonances , one rapidly accumulated a dozen , then eventually greater than one hundred resonant states ! a major contributor to this ` zoo ' of resonant states lay in the ability for accelerators to produce secondary beams of pions and kaons .",
    "these could be scattered from protons and nuclei , and the final states could be analyzed .",
    "our simple analysis of resonances was carried out for spinless particles . for particles with spin",
    "it is necessary to combine spin and orbital angular momentum in order to determine the total spin and parity of a given resonance .",
    "sophisticated multi - channel partial - wave analyses were developed to extract the scattering amplitudes from experimental reaction data . as energies increased many final states involved three or more strongly interacting particles .",
    "a major advance in resonance phenomenology was the introduction of the _ dalitz plot _",
    ", a method to analyze three - body ( and higher ) final states from scattering reactions @xcite .",
    "dalitz plot for the reaction @xmath61 .",
    "the shading represents the frequency of events , with blue denoting few and red signifying many events .",
    "four resonances are visible in this plot.,width=316 ]    to understand the dalitz plot , consider a reaction @xmath62 leading to three final - state particles . for the dalitz plot one graphs the data vs.  the squared invariant mass of one pair of final - state particles on one axis and the invariant mass of a second pair on a perpendicular axis .",
    "the data points fall inside well defined kinematic limits , since one can show @xmath63 const .",
    "each observed event corresponds to a point inside the dalitz plot .",
    "if the scattering state decays uniformly into three particles , the resulting points will be uniformly distributed .",
    "however , two - body resonances appear as enhancements in the dalitz plot , at the location of the resonant mass . furthermore , the structure of these bands depends on the spin and parity of the resonant state(s ) .",
    "[ fig : dalitzplot ] shows the dalitz plot for the reaction @xmath61 , from the crystal barrel experiment @xcite .",
    "the data points are represented by shading , with blue denoting few and red signifying many events .",
    "the axes are chosen as the invariant mass of two different @xmath64 pairs .",
    "the pion bose symmetry requires that the dalitz plot be symmetric about any axis that exchanges two pions .",
    "four resonances are identified in this plot .",
    "the spin-0 @xmath65(1500 ) appears as a simple enhancement .",
    "two spin-2 resonances , the @xmath66(1270 ) and @xmath66(1565 ) , have a more complicated shape .",
    "the final resonance , the @xmath65(980 ) with spin @xmath67 , also appears on the plot . because of quantum mechanical interference between amplitudes , the @xmath65(980 ) appears as a _ dip _ rather than a peak in the distribution of events .",
    "the dalitz plot has proved incredibly useful in enabling experimentalists to locate resonances in reactions with multi - particle final states .",
    "in addition , this technique provides a quick estimate of the spin and parity of the observed state .",
    "by the beginning of the 1960s , there were of order 100 known resonances .",
    "these could be classified into _",
    "baryon resonances _ , strongly interacting states with half - integral total angular momentum @xmath13 , and _ meson resonances _ , states with integral ( or zero ) spin .",
    "what had initially been exciting discoveries of a few new states had become almost an embarrassment .",
    "this apparent over - abundance of resonances was for awhile quite perplexing .",
    "the situation seemed to cry out for introduction of a classification scheme that would make sense of the masses and spins of the plethora of observed resonances .",
    "the first significant breakthrough came in 1960 - 61 , when neeman and gell - mann independently showed that nearly all mesons and baryons could be grouped in multiplets defined by the symmetry @xmath68 @xcite . in this scheme , dubbed the ` eightfold way ' by gell - mann , the observed resonances occurred in families when plotted vs.  their electric charge , isotopic spin and strangeness values .",

    "one could derive formulae relating the masses of particles within a multiplet ; these formulae were generally accurate to within a few percent .",
    "significant support for this classification scheme came in 1962 with the discovery of the @xmath73 doublet with strangeness @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "this left only one missing member of the baryon decuplet , and gell - mann predicted a new baryon with spin - parity @xmath75 and strangeness @xmath76 @xcite dubbed the @xmath77 ; multiplet mass formulae predicted a mass 1680 mev . in 1964",
    "the @xmath77 was discovered at brookhaven in bubble chamber photographs of @xmath78 reactions @xcite ; its mass was estimated as 1686 mev .",
    "similar @xmath68 multiplets , with corresponding mass formulae for the multiplet members , could be constructed for the known pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "the next step was to find an underlying theory that explained why mesons and baryons should inhabit such multiplets .",
    "this answer was provided in 1964 independently by gell - mann @xcite and zweig @xcite , who proposed that baryon and meson structure could be explained naturally by the existence of _ quarks _ ( zweig called them _ aces _ ) .",
    "the idea was that there existed three types of quarks , now called _ flavors _",
    "( up , down and strange ) , each with its corresponding antiquark .",
    "baryons were composed of three quarks and a meson was a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "individual quarks were fermions with intrinsic spin @xmath50 ; strangeness was an additive property , with the up and down quarks having @xmath79 and the strange quark @xmath71 .",
    "however , in order to produce the observed spectrum of particles , it was necessary that quarks possess electric charges that were a fraction of the proton s charge , specifically the up quark had charge @xmath80 and the down and strange quarks had charge @xmath81 ( an antiquark had opposite strangeness , charge and intrinsic parity from its respective quark ) .      following the introduction of quarks , the proton was considered to be a three - quark combination consisting of two up quarks and one down quark .",
    "this would produce the requisite electric charge of @xmath82 and strangeness zero . in a similar vein",
    ", the @xmath83 meson with strangeness @xmath84 and charge @xmath82 could be composed of an up quark and a strange antiquark .",
    "furthermore , the spin and parity of a baryon or meson could in principle be constructed by forming various spin - parity combinations of the requisite quarks .",
    "several groups began to consider what are now known as _",
    "constituent quark models _ to investigate the apparent properties of these quark combinations , in terms of the known spins , parities and masses of known states @xcite . beginning in the mid 1960s , such efforts had some notable successes .",
    "many of the properties of the baryon octet and decuplet could be reproduced in a constituent quark model with up and down quarks of roughly 340 mev mass and a strange quark mass in the vicinity of 450 mev .",
    "the three valence quarks in the proton would occupy the lowest states in a confining potential such as an harmonic oscillator .",
    "the up quark spins were parallel to the direction of the proton s spin , and the down quark was anti - parallel , with the three quarks coupled to overall spin @xmath50 and isospin @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath85(1232 ) state was composed of three up quarks , in the same confining potential . here",
    "the quark spins are aligned , producing overall spin - parity @xmath75 .",
    "the strength of the color magnetic interaction could be inferred from the @xmath86 mass splitting .",
    "the @xmath4 is composed of @xmath87 valence quarks .",
    "the @xmath88 splitting gives the mass of the strange constituent quark .",
    "in this model of the @xmath4 , the light quarks are coupled to spin @xmath67 and the spin of the strange quark is parallel to the @xmath4 spin direction . in a similar vein ,",
    "the lowest nonets of pseudoscalar and vector mesons are made by coupling @xmath89 pairs .    despite their apparent success in describing the lightest hadron multiplets",
    ", constituent quark models encountered a series of problems .",
    "some of these were : ( 1 ) the constituent quark model predicts that the first excited baryons should have negative parity . however , the lowest - lying nucleon excited state , the @xmath90 , has positive parity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the masses , spins and parities of excited baryonic and mesonic levels disagreed with constituent quark predictions . ( 2 ) constituent quark masses consistent with the lowest baryon and meson multiplets dramatically over - predicted the pion mass of about 140 mev .",
    "( 3 ) the constituent quark model suggested that quarks in a nucleon were rather lightly bound and non - relativistic . arguing from experience with atomic nuclei ,",
    "the constituent quark model suggested that it should be reasonably easy to eject an individual quark from a proton and observe it in a detector .",
    "( 4 ) this suggested that fractional charges could be emitted from nucleons .",
    "many extremely sensitive experiments were mounted to search for fractional charges ; apart from one or two anomalous results , no isolated fractional charges were ever detected @xcite .",
    "( 5 ) constituent quark models required the quarks to be totally symmetric upon interchange of space , spin and isospin quantum numbers .",
    "constituent quark ( fermion ) wave functions thus violated the pauli principle .",
    "the non - observation of free quarks and violation of the pauli principle led some to postulate that quarks might not be real but might simply represent a mathematical ` mnemonic ' device enabling one to predict meson and baryon properties .",
    "however , several arguments against the ` reality ' of quarks were soon overcome .",
    "first was the discovery of the property of _ color _ , an additive property of quarks which takes on three values @xcite .",
    "all stable particles exist only in combinations of quarks and antiquarks that couple to zero net color . for baryons ,",
    "the resulting three - quark wavefunction is completely color - antisymmetric .",
    "thus quark wavefunctions obey the pauli principle when one includes color degrees of freedom .",
    "the next significant evidence for quarks came from deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) reactions @xcite .",
    "these involved scattering of leptons ( charged leptons , or neutrino - induced charge - changing reactions ) from nucleons at very large momentum transfers ; one observed only the outgoing lepton and no information regarding the struck nucleon(s ) .",
    "such reactions showed distinctive features consistent with scattering from elementary pointlike objects inside the proton and neutron . later in these lectures",
    ", we will discuss in considerable detail the history of dis reactions , what they reveal about baryon structure , and our current understanding of quark - parton distributions in the nucleon .",
    "the quark model was extended with the discovery of three additional quark flavors . in 1974",
    "the charm quark was discovered , with mass roughly 1500 mev @xcite . in 1977",
    "the bottom quark was discovered , with a mass about 4500 mev @xcite .",
    "finally 1995 marked the discovery of the top quark , with a mass roughly 171,000 mev @xcite .",
    "the quarks can be grouped into three doublets ( u , d ) ( c , s ) and ( t , b ) ; in each pair the first quark has charge @xmath91 and the second quark @xmath92 . except for the light quarks ,",
    "the doublets are also characterized by exceptionally large mass splittings .    with the discovery of heavier quark flavors one expects to see additional multiplets of particles containing the heavy quarks ( the right side of fig .",
    "[ fig : multiplets ] shows low - lying multiplets with 4 flavors ) .",
    "we now know that the up and down quark masses are much smaller than the ` constituent ' quarks ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 ` current quark ' masses are roughly 4 mev and 9 mev , respectively ) .",
    "thus , the nucleon mass contains very large contributions from sea quarks and gluons , and there is no way that a non - relativistic perturbative treatment can explain the properties of baryons containing only light quarks . on the other hand , charm and bottom quarks",
    "are sufficiently massive that simple models should accurately describe hadrons containing these quarks . heavy quark effective theory ( hqet )",
    "has made great use of the simplifications that arise due to the very large mass of the heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "we have now a detailed theory of quark interactions .",
    "this has culminated in a non - abelian gauge theory of quarks interacting through the exchange of colored gluons , the carriers of the strong force between quarks .",
    "this theory is known as _ quantum chromodynamics _ or qcd @xcite .",
    "a first breakthrough was an understanding of the phenomenon of _",
    "asymptotic freedom_. through the nobel prize - winning work of gross and wilczek and politzer @xcite , it was demonstrated that qcd had the property that at high energies ( or alternatively , at very short distances ) the interaction between quarks became progressively weaker and weaker . at these very high energies",
    ", one could approximate interactions with quarks in terms of free quark interactions .",
    "asymptotic freedom demonstrated why deeply inelastic scattering at very high momentum transfers looks like scattering from free constituents .",

    "the decrease of the coupling constant with energy demonstrates the phenomenon of asymptotic freedom .",
    "right : schematic picture of quark confinement .",

    "[ fig : asymptot ] shows the strong coupling constant @xmath97 as a function of energy .",
    "the property of asymptotic freedom is demonstrated by the monotonic decrease in @xmath97 with increasing energy .",
    "conversely , the strong coupling strength increases rapidly at low energies .",
    "this means that an understanding of qcd at low energies must deal with very strongly - interacting systems .",
    "this is additionally complicated by the realization that gluons have strong self - coupling , unlike the situation in qed .",
    "qcd offered formidable challenges to the development of models of strongly interacting systems .",
    "a second major feature of qcd is that an individual colored quark experiences a force that grows monotonically at large distances .",
    "this is shown schematically in the right - hand picture in fig .",
    "[ fig : asymptot ] . as a quark - antiquark pair",
    "is separated a string or flux tube forms .",
    "if one attempts to break the string confining an individual quark , eventually one will produce an additional @xmath96 pair ( a meson ) , rather than liberating the quark .",
    "confinement has never been proved analytically in qcd , however it provides a natural explanation for the experimental failure to observe individual quarks .",
    "confinement also occurs in lattice gauge qcd .",
    "the qcd lagrangian has the form & = & ( i^d _ - m ) q - + & = & - - g [ eq : lqcd ] in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lqcd ] ) one sums over all flavors of quark fields , represented by @xmath98 , the quantities @xmath99 represent the eight gluon fields , and the term @xmath100 is the qcd analog of the electromagnetic tensor @xmath101 which occurs in quantum electrodynamics .",
    "an excellent summary of qcd is given in the handbook of perturbative qcd @xcite .    as we have mentioned , the problem of solving the qcd lagrangian at low energies turned out to be formidable .",

    "until that time one expected that nuclear dis in this region would just be the sum of individual lepton - nucleon dis ; thus we would expect @xmath190 per nucleon to be the same regardless of @xmath174 .",
    "the emc effect appears to be nearly universal ; the curves of @xmath175 for various nuclei lie almost on top of one another .",
    "the emc effect inspired more than 1000 papers that considered the origin and explanation of this nuclear effect @xcite .",
    "kulagin and petti @xcite claim that three different mechanisms play a role in the emc effect .",
    "the first two involve nuclear binding and off - shell effects on nuclear structure functions . treating bound nucleons non - relativistically and using weak - binding approximations",

    "[ fig : kulagin ] we plot the longitudinal spin - dependent pdfs that have been extracted from experiment .",
    "the experimental results @xcite are from the spin muon collaboration ( smc ) ( open squares ) and hermes ( solid circles ) .",
    "hermes took semi - inclusive dis measurements from polarized proton or deuteron targets , where one measured a final - state meson ( @xmath199 or @xmath200 ) in coincidence with the scattered lepton .",

    "( [ eq : spinconst ] ) shows that in the naive quark picture all the proton spin arises from the quarks , with zero contribution from gluons or orbital angular momentum .",
    "the first quantitative measurements of the quark spin pdfs gave results like @xmath208 . not only was the total proton spin carried by quarks far smaller than 100% , these results were consistent with _ zero _ proton spin being carried by quarks !",
    "this surprising and puzzling result was termed the ` proton spin crisis . '",
    "we have now obtained more precise results and the current best value is @xmath209 .",

    "nevertheless , one very important quantitative question is exactly how do we account for the spin carried by the proton @xcite ?",
    "a related question is whether or not the current experimental result @xmath210 for the proton spin carried by quarks is surprising .",
    "previously we saw that gluons carried a surprisingly large fraction of the proton momentum .",
    "it seems natural to ask whether gluons might also carry much of the proton spin . in order to answer this important question , dedicated experiments to measure gluon contributions to the proton spin",
    "have been mounted at three laboratories .",
    "there is the compass experiment at cern , experiments from the rhic spin group at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven , and the hermes experiment at hera .",
    "we will discuss particularly the compass experiment .    at compass ,",
    "the goal was to measure gluon contributions to the proton spin through photon - gluon fusion @xcite .",

    "the errors are sufficiently large that the sign of @xmath214 is not clear .",
    "the two curves show fits to these data with @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",
    "if one takes the compass values one obtains for the total gluon contribution to the proton spin , @xmath217 for the open charm measurements , and @xmath218 for the high-@xmath211 measurements @xcite . combining the compass measurements with the smc , hermes and rhic spin results , the best value of @xmath205 is small ; however , it is still statistically possible that @xmath205 could be large .",
    "[ fig : pgf ] does not show rhic spin results that give comparable values for @xmath219 in a similar @xmath104 region .      at the present time , despite the large errors on the gluon contribution to the proton s spin , it appears that polarized gluons are unlikely to carry the majority of the proton s spin .",
    "we are left with the question of just what fraction of the spin of the proton is carried by polarized glue , or by quark or gluon orbital momentum .",
    "an area that is being pursued at the moment is hard exclusive processes , such as deeply virtual compton scattering or dvcs ( where a charged lepton interacting with a nucleon exchanges a virtual photon with high @xmath103 , producing a real photon in the final state ) , or exclusive meson production in lepton - nucleon scattering .",
    "these processes can be described in terms of so - called generalized parton distributions or gpds .",
    "it was shown by ji that a particular moment of the gpds could be related to the total orbital angular momentum of the quarks @xcite .",
    "investigations of dvcs have been undertaken at hera and at jefferson laboratory .",
    "a major focus of the 12 gev upgrade at jefferson lab will be studies of dvcs and exclusive meson production .",
    "the physics of the 12 gev upgrade will be reviewed in detail in the first lecture by tony thomas at this workshop @xcite .",
    "thomas second lecture will summarize his recent work with myrher on the spin of the proton , which will address the questions raised in this section .",
    "to date , much information on the partonic structure of the nucleon has been obtained from a series of high - energy machines . the first experiments that showed scaling in high - energy deep inelastic scattering",
    "were carried out at slac . following these measurements",
    "were continuing fixed - target experiments at slac , and both fixed - target and collider studies at cern and fermilab .",
    "the hera asymmetric electron - proton collider proved to be a nearly ideal facility to map out parton distributions over a very wide range of @xmath104 and @xmath103 .",
    "neutrino and antineutrino beams at fermilab and cern allowed one to separate out contributions from different quark flavors .",
    "studies of drell - yan processes at fermilab and cern provide processes sensitive to sea quark distributions in the nucleon .    now that hera has ceased operations , experiments at cern and fermilab continue .",
    "various new facilities or upgrades of existing ones have the capability of extending our knowledge regarding the partonic structure of the nucleon .",
    "the first is the large hadron collider or lhc which will very shortly begin operation at cern .",
    "the primary thrust of lhc operations will be first to find the higgs particle , a new massive particle which is predicted to appear as the result of the spontaneous breaking of electroweak symmetry .",
    "next , the lhc will focus on discovering either supersymmetric particles or other new phenomena beyond the standard model .",
    "however , the lhc also could have potential applications in determining the partonic content of hadrons .",
    "there are also several new facilities , or upgrades of existing facilities , which could examine the partonic content of hadrons . here",
    "i will discuss one upgrade of an existing facility and one proposed new facility in this regard .",
    "the first , the upgrade of the electron accelerator at thomas jefferson laboratory , is the subject of the first lecture by tony thomas at this workshop @xcite . as a result , i will provide only a brief summary of this project ; i refer the reader to his talk on this subject .",
    "the second is a proposed new electron - ion collider .",
    "two possible versions of this machine have been suggested , one which would be located at brookhaven national laboratory and a second which would be the subject of a future upgrade at jefferson laboratory .",
    "i will very briefly discuss the 12 gev upgrade of the cebaf accelerator at thomas jefferson national laboratory @xcite .",
    "the upgrade will provide 12 gev continuous electron beams to a new hall d experimental area , which will produce real photon beams that should provide precision spectroscopy .",
    "this should help to study possible ` exotic ' states , particularly excited mesons that contain one or more gluons .",
    "in addition , the upgrade would provide up to 11 gev beams to the existing halls a , b and c.    as was mentioned in the preceding section , a major focus of effort following the jefferson lab upgrade would be on hard exclusive processes such as dvcs or exclusive meson production .",
    "it has been shown that these hard exclusive processes can be described in terms of integrals over quark distributions .",
    "these are termed ` generalized parton distributions ' or gpds .",
    "gpds can provide information regarding the longitudinal momentum and transverse position of quarks in the nucleon , and could test the ji sum rule @xcite . following the upgrade , jefferson lab will have unique kinematic capabilities .",
    "it will be able to access parton distributions in regions of @xmath104 and @xmath103 that complement those accessible at laboratories like cern or hera .",
    "in particular , after the upgrade jefferson lab will be able to reach regions of bjorken @xmath220 and values @xmath221 gev@xmath118 .",
    "a proposed new facility is an electron - ion collider .",
    "this would consist of an electron beam colliding with either light ions or heavy ions .",
    "plans to date call for achieving a value @xmath222 gev@xmath118 , with high luminosity .",
    "there are two suggestions for such a facility @xcite . in each case",
    "this would involve building a new accelerator to complement an existing machine .",
    "the first case would involve building an electron ring at brookhaven , to collide with hadrons from the current rhic facility . the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : erhic ] shows a schematic picture of such a facility .",
    "a proposed electron ring would be added to the rhic complex at brookhaven ; the ring would provide electrons with energies in the range 5 - 10 gev , with the possibility of a recirculating linac injector .",

    "right : electron - light ion collider at jefferson lab .",
    "a hadron ring would be added to the cebaf accelerator , accelerating protons and light ions.,width=528 ]    the second scenario would involve building a light ion accelerator at jefferson national laboratory .",
    "this would produce hadrons of 50 - 100 gev , to collide with electrons of roughly 5 gev from cebaf . the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : erhic ] shows a schematic picture of such a facility .",
    "a hadron ring ( in this diagram , shown in a figure - eight configuration ) would be added to the cebaf electron accelerator at jefferson lab .",
    "the ring would provide protons and light ions with energies in the range 50 - 100 gev . the proposed hadron accelerator would feature four intersection points .",
    "present estimates suggest that very high luminosities ( @xmath223@xmath224sec ) might be achieved in such a collider .    with an electron - ion collider",
    "one could provide quantitative measurements of quark spins through semi - inclusive dis .",
    "it would have the possibility of measuring pdfs ( and particularly gluon distributions ) at very small bjorken @xmath104 .",
    "gluon probabilities in the nucleon increase extremely rapidly at very small @xmath104 values , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfs ] .",
    "the large nucleon densities in the center of the nucleus could in principle support extremely large gluon densities .",
    "if gluon distributions continue to increase in the interior of the nucleus , at some point nuclear gluon probabilities would exceed the unitarity bound .",
    "thus one expects at some point for many - body effects to slow down this increase .",
    "some have suggested that this will lead to a qualitatively new cooperative effect termed a color - glass condensate @xcite .",
    "an electron - ion collider , particularly erhic which supports heavy - ion hadronic beams , would be able to probe this dynamical region .",
    "an electron - ion collider would also have the capabilities of exploring generalized parton distributions over a fairly wide kinematic region .",
    "such colliders could also provide detailed quantitative studies of the structure of mesons , particularly pions .",
    "one other area that could be studied with an electron - ion collider is the process of fragmentation .",
    "this is the process whereby a quark produces a final hadron .",
    "possible kinematics for electron - ion colliders would have the capability of exploring both beam fragmentation and the so - called target fragmentation regions .",
