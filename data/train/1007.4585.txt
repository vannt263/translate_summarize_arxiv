    "in order to characterize the fluctuations and collective properties in heavy  ion collisions , phase structure and event  by  event fluctuations have been suggested  @xcite . from _ theoretical _ point  of  view , the dynamical fluctuations are particularly essential regarding to examining of existing statistical models @xcite , characterizing of particle equilibration @xcite and the search for unambiguous signals of _ new state of matter _ @xcite . from the _",
    "phenomenological _ point  of  view , they have been measured at sps and rhic energies  @xcite , i.e , @xmath7 gev .    the success of hadron resonance gas model ( hrg ) in describing the dynamical fluctuations in kaon  to  pion ratios @xcite and the ingredient to have other implications are the motivations of this work , where the fluctuations in the remaining particle ratios , that have been measured so far , i.e , kaon  to  proton and proton  to  pion , shall be analyzed . to bring theoretical and experimental data very close to each others , the experimental acceptance @xmath3 , grand ",
    "canonical statistics and quark phase space occupation factor , @xmath4 , have been utilized .",
    "it has been noticed that the fluctuations over the whole range of center  of  mass energies @xmath0 exhibit a non - monotonic behavior and a certain configuration of @xmath4 , @xmath3 and grand ",
    "canonical statistics , are not able to reproduce the whole experimental data .    the concept of phase space dominance suggested by fermi @xcite six decades ago is applied in this model .",
    "the assumption of _ equilibrium _ single  particle distribution function @xmath1 and extensive thermodynamics that have been shown to perfectly reproduce all thermodynamic quantities , including multiplicities and fluctuations , as long as the energy density is not high enough to derive the hadronic system into the _ new state of matter _ , quark ",
    "gluon plasma ( qgp ) should be no longer valid , particularly , when the energy density exceeds the critical value , as the case at rhic and lhc energies . across the phase transition , the phase space volume , symmetries and accordingly the effective degrees of freedom are likely subject of a prompt change .",
    "therefore , the phase space volume , in which the microscopic states are distributed according to @xmath1 function is conjectured to be a subject of modification , as well . in present work , changing phase space volume and @xmath1 are implemented in the grand  canonical partition function , explicitly at @xmath2 gev , from which the particle number and fluctuation have been calculated .",
    "there are many reasons to apply hrg model .",
    "this model provides a good description for the thermodynamical evolution of the hadronic system below the critical temperature  @xcite and has been successfully used to characterize the conditions deriving the chemical freeze - out  @xcite . apparently , there are many reasons speak for studying of dynamical fluctuations in the baryon  meson yield ratios .",
    "_ statistically _ , the interplay between fermions and bosons is crucial .",
    "the energy threshold required to create baryons and mesons is of a great interest .",
    "size of the system is another ingredient of this study .",
    "_ phenomenologically _ , the strange fluctuations , especially , when passing through _ deconfinement _ phase transition , are conjectured to affect the dynamical fluctuations in the hadronic final state .",
    "the strange dynamical fluctuations are expected to survive through the mixed phase .",
    "therefore , these particle ratios are sensitive to the symmetry change and the dynamics of deconfinement and chiral phase transitions , respectively .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model is given in section [ sec : model ] , where non  extensive single  particle equilibrium distributions are introduced .",

    "it can be characterized by various but a complete set of microscopic states and therefore the physical properties of the quantum systems turn to be accessible in approximation of non - correlated _ free _ hadron resonances .",
    "therefore , the resonances are treated as a free gas  @xcite .",
    "each of them is conjectured to add to the overall thermodynamic pressure of the _ strongly _ interacting hadronic matter .",
    "this statement is valid for free , as well as , strong interactions .",
    "it has been shown that the thermodynamics of strongly interacting system can be approximated to an ideal gas composed of hadron resonances with masses @xmath12gev  @xcite .",
    "the heavier constituents , the smaller thermodynamical quantities .",
    "the main motivation of using the hamiltonian is that it contains all relevant degrees of freedom of confined and strongly interacting matter .",
    "it implicitly includes the interactions that result in the formation of new resonances .",
    "in addition , this model has been shown to provide a quite satisfactory description of the particle production and collective properties in heavy  ion collisions .",
    "the conservation of baryon number @xmath13 represents an additional constrain on grand  canonical partition function .",

    "the most probable state density is to be found by lagrange multipliers , where one of them , @xmath14 , has been expressed in term of the second one , @xmath15 , and the occupation numbers of the system .",
    "apparently , @xmath14 gives how the energy @xmath22 is distributed in the microstates of the equilibrium system and therefore , can be understood as another factor controlling the number of occupied states , at the microcanonical level .    under these assumptions ,",

    "as introduced previously , hrg assumes that the hadron resonances are point - like and non  correlated free gas . therefore , it is conjectured that the average multiplicity @xmath29 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : n2 ] ) , and the dynamical fluctuations @xmath38 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) , are not strongly dependent on the volume fluctuations .",

    "[ fig:1a1 ] & [ fig:2a1 ] .    left panels in both figures show a full comparison between different data using different parameters .",
    "right panels give the final results that satisfactorily describe the non  monotonic behavior .",
    "the quark phase space occupation factor @xmath4 _ alone _ is apparently not able to reproduce the whole data set , although the experimental acceptances of the different detectors have been taken into account .",
    "the largest disagreement occurs at @xmath40gev , is given by bottom curves , especially the dashed parts .",
    "rqmd and hsd are used to generate dynamical fluctuations in corresponding particle yield ratios using rhic configurations .",
    "therefore , their agreement with rhic data is satisfactory .",
    "the dynamical fluctuations in same particle yield ratios and strangeness production in hsd transport approach from sis and sps energies has been given in ref .",
    "although , both rqmd and hsd reflect a global behavior that the fluctuations alternate between negative and positive values , rqmd seems to work nicely at very high energies while hsd obviously covers a much wide range of energy .",
    "some details about rqmd and hsd are now in order .",
    "the relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( rqmd ) is based on color rope mechanism and excitation and/or fragmentation of color strings followed by hadronic re  interactions .",
    "the color rope mechanism represents an important source for the production of strange hadrons .",
    "the comparison with experimental data shows that rqmd reproduces very well the main properties in hadron production and collective properties .",
    "therefore , it is believed to be a reliable model for generating the full momentum space of hadron resonances .",
    "the particle yields from rqmd would be accompanied with statistical uncertainties that basically can be kept arbitrarily small , i.e , generation of large ensemble .",
    "that the microscopic state of rqmd at chemical freeze - out is in good agreement with chemical and kinetic equilibrium leads to believe in rqmd chemical freeze - out parameters @xcite .",
    "the hsd transport approach is based on various degrees of freedom , including quark , diquark , string and hadron .",
    "it describes the creation of dense / hot hadronic matter , the in  medium modification of hadron properties and the overall dynamics .",
    "hsd gives _ numerical _ solution of a coupled set of relativistic transport equations for particles with in  medium self ",
    "energies of test  particle .",
    "it applies two approaches .",
    "one at high energy , where the inelastic interactions are described by mc  techniques , fritiof string model . at low energy , modeling of hadron collisions",
    "is based on experimental inputs .",
    "the transport approach implemented in it takes into account formation and multiple re  scattering of leading pre - hadrons and hadrons and has been designed to reproduce nucleon - nucleon , meson - nucleon and meson - meson cross section data in a wide kinematic range @xcite .",
    "in addition to the assumptions introduced in @xcite , we give here a novel one .",
    "we assume that the prompt raise at @xmath41 gev is to be understood according to a modification in the phase space volume . to this end",
    ", it has been concluded in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath1 is a subject of modification , especially at large @xmath0 . in this limit ,",
    "the energy density available to the system turns to be high enough to cause the hadronic matter , where equilibrium @xmath1 is perfectly able to reproduce almost all essential transport properties and thermodynamic quantities , including the dynamical fluctuations , to go through a phase transition into qgp .",
    "such a phase transition apparently results in various types of modifications , such as symmetries and degrees of freedom . also the configurations of microstates in phase space volume @xmath42 and the single  particle distribution function @xmath1 are not exceptions .    here",
    ", we apply this model to the dynamical fluctuations in @xmath5 and @xmath6 ratios .",
    "these particle yield ratios combine both strangeness and light boson fluctuations . additionally , they are very sensitive to the deconfinement and chiral phase transitions , respectively .",
    "rqmd and hsd simulations result is positive fluctuations at high energy . implementing @xmath4 and @xmath39 in the grand canonical partition function of hrg results in a very well description of the experimentally measured fluctuations in these particle yields over the entire range of @xmath0 .",
    "although the experimental fluctuations are negative overall , the non - monotonic behavior is very well reproduced over a wide range of @xmath0 .",
    "it is obvious , that these dynamical fluctuations non  avoidablely refer to non - extensive and non  equilibrium state of matter , that basically differs from the one at sps energies .",
