    "the asymptotic stationary states of large recurrent attractor neural network models trained with sequences of patterns have been studied some time ago @xcite-@xcite and there has been a recent revival of interest near the storage saturation of patterns @xcite-@xcite . besides network models for asymmetric sequence processing , models with synapses generated by symmetric sequences competing with pattern reconstruction favoured by hebbian synapses have been studied in some of those works @xcite .",
    "these are models with an underlying asynchronous dynamics and phase diagrams were obtained which only exhibit fixed - point solutions , in particular correlated attractors , in accordance with a general expectation for networks with symmetric interaction matrices far from the storage saturation limit in which the ratio @xmath0 of the number of stored patterns @xmath1 and the number of neurons @xmath2 is zero , in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "in contrast , in the case of a synchronous dynamics with symmetric interactions the stationary states may be either fixed - points or cycles of period two , in the same limit @xcite .",
    "rhythmic activity appears in neurobiological systems @xcite and the competition between these features may yield interesting clues .",
    "the presence of self - interactions of the units , which is consistent with detailed balance in the synchronous dynamics of a network with a symmetric interaction matrix , has not been considered so far except in little s model which has a simple hebbian learning rule @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the role of self - interactions which may be either excitatory or inhibitory , is to control the fraction of spin flips in the dynamics .",
    "excitatory interactions may enhance the retrieval performance while inhibitory interactions can give rise to cyclic behaviour .",
    "self - interactions and their relationship to initial overlaps play a crucial role in little s model leading to frozen - in cycles of period two among other features , in the absence of noise @xcite . in a recent work it has been shown that these cycles are destabilised in a slow dynamical process either by synaptic or stochastic noise due to a macroscopic number of stored patterns @xcite . this raises concern about the stability of cycles of period two in general in the synchronous dynamics of networks with symmetric interactions for the specific interesting case of symmetric sequence processing competing with hebbian synapses .",
    "there has been great interest in models with symmetric sequential interactions due to the presence of correlated fixed - point attractors @xcite , which are stationary states that emerge from a balanced competition between sequential and hebbian synapses .",
    "they indicate a selectivity in response to a set of previously learned uncorrelated patterns by means of decreasing correlation coefficients for the attractors with increasingly distant patterns from a stimulus .",
    "correlated attractors have been used to explain the results of experimental recordings of a visual - memory task in the inferotemporal cortex of monkeys @xcite-@xcite . in the case of a synchronous dynamics",
    ", the correlated fixed - point states might be destabilised by the presence of a macroscopic number of flipping spins giving rise to oscillatory overlaps .",
    "the asymptotic states of a feed - forward layered neural network model for competing symmetric sequence processing with hebbian synapses have been discussed in a recent work @xcite .",
    "the model is described by a synchronous dynamics and it is characterised by asymmetric synaptic connections between units in two consecutive layers and there are neither lateral synapses between units in the same layer nor self - interactions of the units .",
    "phase diagrams of stationary states were obtained exhibiting retrieval states , correlated states , symmetric mixture states and stable cycles of period two , for increasingly larger fractions of sequential synapses .",
    "all of these states are robust either to synaptic noise or to stochastic noise due to a macroscopic number of stored patterns .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the synchronous dynamics and the asymptotic states of a recurrent network model of binary units and patterns for competing interaction between symmetric sequence processing and hebbian synapses , in order to investigate the presence and stability of cycles of period two and of other states which could be competing with the retrieval and with the correlated states .",
    "we make use of a generating functional approach ( gfa ) for the dynamics of disordered systems @xcite , which is an exact procedure in the mean - field limit , and we use an adaptation of the numerical simulation procedure of eissfeller and opper ( eo ) @xcite based on the gfa in order to implement the calculation of single - site averages .",
    "we also resort to a recently introduced alternative approach @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following .",
    "we introduce the model in section 2 and present a brief summary of the well known gfa and the eo procedure in section 3 as well as explicit dynamic recursion relations for the overlaps .",
    "we present our results for the phase diagrams in section 4 and conclude with a summary and further discussion in section 5 .",
    "we consider a network of @xmath2 ising neurons in a microscopic state @xmath3 , at the discrete time - step @xmath4 in which each @xmath5 represents the state of an active or inactive neuron , respectively .",
    "the states of all neurons are updated simultaneously at each time - step according to the alignment of each spin with its local field @xmath6 following a microscopic stochastic single spin - flip dynamics with transition probability @xmath7\\,\\,\\ , \\label{2}\\ ] ] ruled by the synaptic noise control parameter @xmath8 . here",
    ", @xmath9 is the synaptic coupling between neurons @xmath10 and @xmath11 and @xmath12 is an external stimulus . the dynamics is a deterministic one when @xmath13 and fully random when @xmath14 . in the former case , @xmath15 .",
    "a macroscopic set @xmath16 , @xmath17 of @xmath18 independent and identically distributed quenched random patterns , each @xmath19 with probability @xmath20 , is embedded in the network by means of the synaptic coupling @xmath9 between distinct neurons @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "one may think of @xmath11 and @xmath10 as pre- and post - synaptic neurons , respectively , the activities of which give rise to that coupling .",
    "we assume , as usual , that a finite number @xmath21 of patterns is condensed so that the overlaps with the state of the network , defined below , are finite and responsible for the signal in the local field .",
    "the remaining macroscopic number of @xmath22 non - condensed patterns will give rise to the noise in the local field . to be specific , we assume that the condensed patterns are cyclic so that @xmath23 .",
    "the non - condensed patterns need not be embedded in the network by the same learning rule as that for the condensed patterns .",
    "indeed , one may think that those patterns have been learned in a previous stage , in accordance with an argument that has been used before @xcite .",
    "we make use of this freedom in order to simplify the calculations by assuming a hebbian rule for the non - condensed patterns .",
    "guided by work on the layered feed - forward network @xcite , we expect qualitatively the same results as those obtained here for the same learning rule for condensed and non - condensed patterns .",
    "thus , altogether , we take a synaptic coupling of the form + @xmath24 + in which each value of @xmath25 @xmath26 defines a model so that when @xmath27 we get little s model with a hebbian rule and when @xmath28 we have the purely symmetric sequential model .",
    "the first and the second summations are responsible for the signal in the local field while the last summation is responsible for the noise and we comment on that term in section 5 . the self - interaction @xmath29 is a real non - random variable which can take any positive or negative value enhancing or inhibiting , respectively , the local field in the form of a pattern - independent contribution @xmath30 .",
    "it either tends to enforce the actual state of unit @xmath10 , if @xmath29 is positive , or to switch the state if @xmath29 is negative .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the system is described by the moment generating functional @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a set of auxiliary variables that serve to generate averages of moments of the states and the brackets denote an average over all possible paths of states with probability @xmath33 that follows from ( 2 ) . assuming that for @xmath34 only the statistical properties of the stored patterns will influence the macroscopic behaviour of the system , one obtains the relevant quantities which are the overlap @xmath35 of @xmath36 with any one of the condensed patterns @xmath37 , the two - time correlation function @xmath38 and the response function @xmath39 , given by @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 where the bar denotes the configurational average with the non - condensed patters @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) and the restriction @xmath45 is due to causality .",
    "the two - consecutive - time correlation function has a particular meaning since @xmath46 gives the fraction of flipping spins between two consecutive times as @xmath47 .    following the now standard procedure in which the disorder average is done before the sum over the neuron states one obtains exactly , in the large @xmath2 limit , the generating functional @xcite @xmath48 } \\big{\\rangle}_{\\{\\phi_i^s \\ } } \\label{9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath49 is the probability of the initial microscopic configuration while @xmath50 denotes an average over a set of temporarily correlated gaussian random variables @xmath51 for unit @xmath10 , with zero - average and a correlation matrix given below .",
    "the random variables on different units turn out to be uncorrelated and one is left with a single - site effective theory in which a neuron evolves in time according to the transition probability @xmath52 \\,\\ , \\label{10}\\ ] ] with an effective local field given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 and we assumed that @xmath55 .",
    "the two non - trivial contributions to the effective local field for @xmath56 come from a retarded self - interaction involving the matrix elements @xmath57_{t s } \\label{13}\\ ] ] and the zero - average temporarily correlated gaussian noise @xmath58 with variance @xmath59_{t s}\\,\\,.\\\\ \\label{14}\\ ] ] here , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are matrices with elements @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively",
    ". both contributions account for memory effects in the network that come from the noise in the original local field due to the macroscopically large number of non - condensed patterns .",
    "the dynamics of each of the macroscopic quantities , given by ( [ 6]-[8 ] ) , is obtained from the statistics of the effective single neuron process through the average @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are now single - site vectors that follow a path in discrete times , and @xmath67 is the single - spin path probability given the gaussian noise @xmath68 in the effective field , with a distribution @xmath69 in order to obtain the full dynamic description of the transients for @xmath70 , we make use of the procedure of eissfeller and opper in which the effective single - site dynamics given by ( [ 10]-[17 ] ) is simulated by a monte - carlo method .",
    "there are no finite - size effects , but a large number @xmath71 of stochastic trajectories has to be generated for the single - site process in order to keep the numerical error small .",
    "the macroscopic parameters can then be obtained from the average @xmath72 where @xmath73 denotes the spin along the path @xmath74 .",
    "the number of stochastic trajectories @xmath71 should not be confused with the number of neurons @xmath2 , which goes to infinity .",
    "the specific algorithm that implements the eo method is described in the literature @xcite .    for a finite loading of patterns ( @xmath75 )",
    "we can obtain analytically recursion relations for the condensed overlaps and expressions for the correlation coefficients defined below . in this case the effective local field ( [ 11 ] ) assumes the form @xmath76 so that @xmath77 becomes @xmath68 independent and the integral over @xmath68 in ( [ 15 ] ) equals unity .",
    "now @xmath78 still depends on the microscopic state of the system at time step @xmath4 and in order to calculate the sum over the paths in the average @xmath79 we follow the procedure introduced in @xcite . assuming an initial distribution @xmath80 $ ] , which corresponds to an initial vector overlap with components @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) , the following system of recurrence relations can be derived @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 . at a time step @xmath4 ,",
    "one has to update all the @xmath86 possible values of the single - site average @xmath87 by means of ( [ 20 ] ) , each one related to a given realization of @xmath88 .",
    "this procedure allows to calculate the overlaps at the same time step through ( [ 21 ] ) . for @xmath27 and @xmath89 , ( [ 20 ] ) and ( [ 21 ] ) can be written as a single recurrence relation for the overlap with one condensed pattern and one recovers the results for little s model @xcite .    in this work",
    "we are also interested in studying the correlation between the stationary states of the network generated by different initially stimulated patterns . defining @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) as the stationary state corresponding to a stimulus in pattern @xmath92 , represented by an initial condition on the overlaps of the form @xmath81 ( @xmath93 ) ,",
    "the normalised correlation coefficient between two stationary states is defined by @xcite @xmath94 we may use the self - average property to write ( [ 22 ] ) in the large - n limit , for @xmath75 , as @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are determined by the fixed - point solutions of ( [ 20 ] ) and ( [ 21 ] ) . when @xmath98 the summations over sites in ( [ 22 ] ) can no longer be replaced by the averages over patterns in ( [ 23 ] ) , but one may use the similarity of the overlap vector with that at @xmath75 as a guide to decide if one is in the presence of a correlated state or not . in this model , the structure of the stationary overlap vector is the same when different initially stimulated patterns are considered .",
    "thus the correlation coefficient @xmath99 depends only on the distance @xmath100 between the patterns in the sequence .",
    "the correlated stationary states one is interested in a visual - memory task are those for which the decreasing correlation coefficients vanish ( or almost vanish ) for increasing @xmath101 , indicating a clear selectivity with respect to the patterns in the sequence .",
    "we focus mainly on phases of retrieval , cyclic and correlated fixed - point states .",
    "all the explicit results shown in this section were obtained assuming an initial overlap @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) , with @xmath104 .",

    "popular @xmath112 which favours the retrieval phase is to be within the basin of attraction of the other phases of interest for convenient values of @xmath29 .",
    "we consider in this work @xmath113 condensed patterns in all the cases studied , which is suitable due to the following .",
    "first , an interesting sequence for associative - memory tasks should not be too short .",
    "second , we expect that already for a value of @xmath21 of this size the phase diagrams should only exhibit small quantitative differences in the phase boundaries for different values of @xmath21 , guided by the results for the feed - forward network @xcite .",
    "third , we are interested in fixed - point correlated states @xcite , characterised by well - defined correlation coefficients @xmath114 that decrease down to a vanishingly small value for the largest @xmath101 which should not be too small .",
    "although only few results can be derived analytically ( see below ) due to the complexity of the problem , all the features of the phase diagrams can be obtained numerically for @xmath75 .",
    "we show first the results in that case for the stationary behaviour obtained by means of the iteration of ( [ 20 ] ) and ( [ 21 ] ) until a stationary overlap vector @xmath115 is reached .",
    "the @xmath116 phase diagram of stationary states in the absence of noise ( @xmath105 ) is shown in figure [ fig1 ] . given a value of @xmath25 ( which defines a model ) and the initial overlap with the condensed patterns that specifies the basins of attraction of the phases of interest , the size and the sign of the self - interaction @xmath29 yields the various stationary phases as indicated .",
    "the variety of the phases is also investigated studying the behaviour of the system as a function of the model parameter @xmath25 , for a given @xmath29 .    for large values of @xmath117 , there is a phase @xmath110 of frozen - in fixed - points for positive @xmath29 , with an overlap @xmath118 ( @xmath82 ) that stays the same as the initial overlap for all times , and there is a phase @xmath111 of frozen - in cycles for negative @xmath29 , with an overlap @xmath119 ( @xmath82 ) that keeps switching between the initial overlap and its opposite .",
    "the phase boundaries of @xmath110 and @xmath111 can be derived analytically from ( [ 20 ] ) and ( [ 21 ] ) in the @xmath120 limit iterating the condensed overlaps at consecutive times .",
    "writing the initial overlap as @xmath121 ( @xmath103 ) , for a general @xmath122 @xmath123 , this yields first an expression for @xmath124 at the first time step in terms of @xmath29 , @xmath25 and @xmath122 .",
    "the conditions that @xmath125 or @xmath126 ( the case for @xmath110 or @xmath111 , respectively ) are @xmath127 which are independent of @xmath21 .",

    "it is appropriate to note here that the latter is a phase that arises from the competition between sequential and hebbian processing and it is not present in little s model with pure hebbian synapses .",

    "as frozen - in states in the absence of noise and become destabilised by synaptic or stochastic noise , there appear now in the case where @xmath190 also stable dynamic cycles of period two , either with or even without noise . these are cycles that evolve from the initial overlap to a stationary state , and they appear in a large region of the phase diagram .",
    "the retrieval behaviour and the fixed - point correlated states are also enhanced by the presence of a self - interaction and in this work we investigated the changes in the phase diagrams due to that interaction .",
    "phase diagrams of stationary states were obtained in this work and it was shown that fixed - point correlated states are clearly separated from both phases of cyclic states already for a small but finite synaptic noise , independently of the size ( and even in the absence ) of a self - interaction .",
    "this suggests , within the limited conclusions that can be drawn from an attractor neural network model , that there should be no interference of the oscillating states produced by the synchronous dynamics with the correlated fixed - point states that are crucial in visual task experiments .",
    "we comment , next , on the last summation in the synaptic interaction given by ( [ 3 ] ) , which is responsible for the noise term in the local field @xmath191 .",
    "one may consider a more general form @xmath192 with an interaction matrix of the same form as ( [ 12 ] ) for the condensed part , @xmath193 with @xmath194 , which could be equal to @xmath25 .",
    "the case we considered here , for simplicity , is a hebbian noise with @xmath195 .",
    "the more general form has been used in the case of the layered feed - forward network @xcite and one may infer from the results of that work the qualitative changes on the results presented here when @xmath196 .",
    "it turns out that the pure hebbian case underestimates slightly the storage capacity of the fixed - point states for large values of @xmath25 . on the other hand ,",
    "the storage capacity for almost pure cyclic behaviour , with small @xmath25 , is overestimated by a pure hebbian noise , and this is one of the reasons for the large value of @xmath173 for which the cyclic states are still stable in both cyclic phases @xmath150 and @xmath151 , as found in section 4 .    finally , there are a few features of the model which are worth pointing out . first , is that the results obtained with the symmetric interactions @xmath9 in ( [ 3 ] ) , are quite different from those for little s model .",
    "one of these results is the presence of fixed - point correlated states , another one is the presence of stable cycles in phases @xmath150 and @xmath151 , in distinction to the absence of cycles in little s model with noise .",
    "furthermore , excitatory self - interactions enhance fixed - point correlated states as shown by the enlarged upper part of the @xmath149 phase .",
    "also , inhibitory self - interactions are not only responsible for the enhancement of the fraction of flipping spins , a feature that is known from little s model , but even for the presence of fixed - point correlated states as demonstrated by the lower part of the @xmath149 phase .",
    "the presence of the various stationary states shown in this work depends on the relationship between the self - interaction @xmath29 , the initial overlap @xmath178 and the value of @xmath25 .",
    "these quantities shape the basins of attraction of the simplest stationary states and other states could be considered with alternative initial states if necessary .",
    "an interesting extension of this work would be to consider random self - interactions .",
