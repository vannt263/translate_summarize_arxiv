    "theoretical studies of light hadron spectroscopy have led to the widespread belief that gluonic excitations are present in the spectrum of hadrons , so more resonances should be observed than are predicted by the conventional @xmath0 and @xmath9 quark model .",
    "the two general categories of gluonic mesons expected are glueballs ( dominated by pure glue basis states ) and hybrids ( dominated by basis states in which a @xmath0 is combined with a gluonic excitation ) .",
    "some of these novel states , notably the light hybrids , are predicted to have exotic quantum numbers ( forbidden to @xmath0 ) , such as j@xmath10 .",
    "the confirmation of such a resonance would be proof of the existence of exotic non-@xmath0 states , and would be a crucial step towards establishing the spectrum of gluonic states . there are detailed theoretical predictions for the decays of these exotic hybrids @xcite , which have motivated several experimental studies of purportedly favored hybrid channels such as @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    although one would prefer to find these unambiguously non-@xmath0 j@xmath13-exotics , glueballs and hybrids with non - exotic quantum numbers are also expected .",
    "for example , in the flux tube model the lowest hybrid multiplet , expected at @xmath14-@xmath15 gev @xcite , contains the non - exotics j@xmath16 and @xmath17 in addition to the exotics @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . to identify these non - exotic states one needs to distinguish them from the `` background '' of radial and orbital @xmath0 excitations in the mass region @xmath21-@xmath22 gev , where the first few gluonic levels are anticipated@xcite .",
    "our point of departure is to calculate the two - body decay modes of all radial and orbital excitations of @xmath1 states ( @xmath23 ) anticipated up to 2.1 gev .",
    "this includes 2s , 3s , 2p , 1d and 1f multiplets , a total of 32 resonances in the @xmath1 sector .",
    "we also summarize the experimental status and important decays of candidate members of these multiplets , and compare the predictions for decay rates with experiment .",
    "we start by briefly reviewing the established 1s and 1p states that confirm that p0 pair creation dominates most hadronic decays .",
    "sho wavefunctions are employed for convenience ; these lead to analytic results for decay amplitudes and are known to give reasonable empirical approximations .",
    "this is sufficient for our main purpose , which is to emphasize selection rules and to isolate major modes to aid in the identification of states .",
    "in addition to the 1s and 1p states we also find reasonable agreement between the model and decays of 1d , 2p and 1f states where data exist ; this confirms the extended utility of the model and adds confidence to its applications to unknown states .",
    "examples of new results include the following .",
    "@xmath24 the radial 2@xmath4p@xmath5 @xmath25 is strongly suppressed in s - wave , and dominant in d - wave .",
    "this contrasts with the expectation for a hybrid @xmath26 .",
    "the model s prediction of a dominant d - wave has been dramatically confirmed for the @xmath27@xcite and thereby establishes 1.7  gev as the approximate mass of the @xmath1 members of the 2p nonets .",
    "this includes the @xmath28 nonet whose i=0 members share the quantum numbers of the scalar glueball .",
    "@xmath24 in the scalar glueball sector , we find that the decays of the @xmath29 and the @xmath30 are inconsistent with radially excited quarkonia .",
    "@xmath24 we identify the 2s @xmath31 nonet .",
    "the @xmath32 members are predicted to have narrow widths relative to the @xmath33 counterpart .",
    "this is consistent with the broad @xmath34 and the narrower candidates @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath24 the vector states @xmath37 and @xmath38 are interesting in that the decay branching fractions appear to show anomalous features requiring a hybrid component .",
    "we identify the experimental signatures needed to settle this question .",
    "@xmath24 the @xmath39 has been cited as a likely hybrid candidate@xcite on the strength of its decay fractions .",
    "the 3s @xmath31 @xmath0 @xmath33 is also anticipated in this region .",
    "we find that the decays of the hybrid and 3s @xmath31 have characteristic differences which enable them to be distinguished .",
    "we identify modes that may enable the separation of these two configurations .",
    "our other results for the many @xmath1 states predicted up to 2.1 gev should be useful in the identification of these higher quarkonia , and in confirming that non - exotic gluonic or molecular states are indeed inconsistent with quarkonium assignments .",
    "the order of discussion is 1s and 1p ( section 2 ) ; 2s and @xmath40 ( section 3 ) ; 3s ( section 4 ) ; 2p ( section 5 ) ; 1d ( section 6 ) ; 1f ( section 7 ) . a summary and an outline for experimental strategy is in section 8 .",
    "first we will use the well known decays of light 1s and 1p @xmath1 states to motivate and constrain the p0 decay model .",
    "ackleh , barnes and swanson@xcite have carried out a systematic study of @xmath41 decays in the p0 and related pair creation decay models : in that work a p0-type amplitude was established as dominant in most light @xmath42 decays .",
    "( for other discussions of @xmath43 decays in the p0 model see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "fig.1 , from ref.@xcite , shows p0 model predictions for the decay widths .",
    "large widths are indeed predicted to be large and smaller widths are found to be correspondingly small . if we choose the pair creation strength @xmath44 ( eq .",
    "a3 ) to set an approximately correct overall width scale , then @xmath45 and @xmath46 are both @xmath47-@xmath48 gev ; @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are all @xmath52-@xmath53 gev , and @xmath54 is smallest , @xmath55 gev ; all are reasonably close to the observed widths .",

    "the model parameters shown are @xmath57-@xmath58 gev ( with @xmath59 gev preferred ) and @xmath44 .",
    "the optimum parameter values found in a fit to the partial widths of fig.1@xcite are @xmath60  gev ( which is actually the length scale most commonly used in light @xmath0 decays ) and @xmath61 ; with these values the rms relative error for these six decays is @xmath62 . in this work",
    "we have actually found that the pair production amplitude @xmath44 is somewhat large for higher - l @xmath0 states , so in our discussions of higher quarkonia we will instead use @xmath63 . in constrained-@xmath64",
    "fits we find that using @xmath63 only moderately decreases the accuracy of the fit to the light 1s and 1p decays , to @xmath65 , with an optimum @xmath66  gev .",
    "a more sensitive test of the p0 model involves amplitude ratios in the decays @xmath67 and @xmath68 . in these decays both s- and d - wave final states are allowed , and the ratio of these decay amplitudes is known to be d / s = @xmath69 for the @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "this ratio is quite sensitive to the quantum numbers of the produced pair ; with p0 quantum numbers and the usual @xmath72 we find reasonable agreement in sign and magnitude , whereas a oge pair production mechanism gives the wrong sign for d / s @xcite .",
    "this ratio test for @xmath67 was historically very important in establishing the p0 decay model @xcite .",
    "these successes of the p0 model motivate its use in predicting decays of the less familiar radial and orbital excitations of light quarkonia .",
    "we first consider the decays of the low - lying radially - excited pseudoscalar and vector states .",
    "our general approach will be to review recent data on the state in question and compare these data to predictions for candidate @xmath0 and ( where appropriate ) hybrid states . in each case we will attempt to identify decay modes that distinguish between competing assignments most clearly .",

    "et al._@xcite in 1982 but remains rather poorly known .",
    "it is seen in @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , with a width of 200 - 600 mev ; there is however no accurate measurement of the branching fractions @xcite .",
    "recently higher statistics have been obtained for the @xmath34 by ves@xcite and by e852 at bnl@xcite .",
    "the ves data shows a clear @xmath34 peak in @xmath78 , with a width of @xmath79-@xmath80 mev in both @xmath81 and @xmath82 ; the latter is particularly strong and dominates this channel below 2 gev .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the size of the deck background in @xmath83 is uncertain , and it is not clear whether the @xmath34 reported in @xmath83 is actually due to the resonance .",
    "fig.1c of ref.@xcite suggests that the deck mechanism could cause _ all _ of the @xmath84 enhancement in fig.4a of that reference .",
    "we will assume that this is essentially correct , and that the @xmath34 resonance decays dominantly to @xmath85 .    in the p0 decay model we expect @xmath85 to be the dominant mode of a 2s @xmath0 @xmath34 , since this is the only open two - body channel .",
    "( we assume that the @xmath86 and @xmath87 are dominantly k@xmath88 , so the mode @xmath89 is a more complicated three body or virtual two - body decay . ) with our parameter set @xmath63 and @xmath90  gev we predict a partial width of    @xmath91    this rate is given in table b2 of appendix b. ( app.b is a tabulation of all our numerical results for partial widths in the p0 model . ) in fig.2 we show the dependence of this prediction on the wavefunction length scale @xmath72 .",
    "evidently the prediction of a large width , comparable to observation , follows from any plausible choice for @xmath72 . thus the observed @xmath34 is consistent with expectations for a 2@xmath6s@xmath7 @xmath0 state .",

    "this possibility may be tested by varying @xmath96 ; the resulting @xmath97 does not exceed @xmath98 mev over the range @xmath99-@xmath100 mev .",
    "thus , the population of a @xmath81 mode by @xmath34 decays through an intermediate @xmath101 state is predicted to be a small effect .",
    "if there actually is a large @xmath102 mode , rather than a nonresonant deck effect , this would be in disagreement with the p0 model .",

    "@xmath24 @xmath35    this state has a width of @xmath103 mev@xcite , much narrower than its i=1 2@xmath6s@xmath7 partner @xmath34 .",
    "it has been reported in @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "this small width is natural if the @xmath34 does indeed decay dominantly to @xmath106 , since g - parity forbids the analogous processes @xmath107 and @xmath108 ; to the extent that the @xmath87 and @xmath86 are dominantly @xmath109 there are no quasi - two - body @xmath43 modes open to the @xmath35 .",
    "consequently the decays must proceed through the weaker direct three - body and virtual two - body channels such as @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",

    "suppose for illustration that we had instead used 1s wavefunctions for the @xmath34 and @xmath35 ; we would then have predicted partial widths of several hundred mev into the low - energy tails of the modes @xmath101 and @xmath112 , with consequent broad widths for the @xmath34 _ and _ the @xmath35 , in contradiction with experiment .",

    "of course the @xmath116 mode is not expected from @xmath117 , and if confirmed may imply large @xmath123 mixing in this sector as is observed in the 1s i=0 pseudoscalars .",
