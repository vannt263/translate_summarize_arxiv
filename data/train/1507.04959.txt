    "to search and understand deeply physical aspects of the astrophysical and cosmological phenomena there still remain several challenging and intrigued problems for the theoretical physicists .",
    "einstein s theory of gravitation , though has been always a very fruitful tool for uncovering hidden mysteries of nature , does not meet all the criteria to explain the current paradigm of astrophysics and cosmology . as a result , several alternative theories of gravity have been proposed time to time . recently , two generalized functional theories , namely , @xmath1 gravity and @xmath0 gravity , received more attention as an alternative theories of einsteinian gravitational theory .",
    "however , @xmath0 theory of gravity is more controllable than @xmath1 theory because the field equations in the former one are restricted to the second order differential equations whereas the later case is relatively difficult to handle as those are of fourth order differential equations @xcite .",
    "obviously one can take help from the palatini approach to make @xmath1 theory a second order system of differential equations @xcite .",
    "another general feature of @xmath0 gravity is that its construction is associated with a generalized lagrangian @xcite .    in connection to application of @xmath0 gravity",
    "we note that most research have been oriented to cosmology - theoretical presentation as well as observational verification  @xcite .",
    "however , later on astrophysical applications also can be observed in the following works  @xcite . among these works we are specially interested to the works of  @xcite .",
    "@xcite claimed that relativistic stars in @xmath0 theory of gravity do not exist whereas @xcite proved that they do exist . in the present work we shall follow the result of @xcite by considering the problem in @xmath0 gravity along with conformal killing vector field .",
    "there are some other standard works on @xmath0 gravity which one may consult for further studies with various physical aspects  @xcite .",
    "the conformal killing vectors ( ckv ) provide inheritance symmetry which conveniently makes a natural relationship between geometry and matter through the einstein field equations . in favor of the prescription of this mathematical technique ckv , @xcite mention the following features : ( 1 ) it provides a deeper insight into the spacetime geometry and facilitates the generation of exact solutions to the einstein field equations in a more comprehensive forms , ( 2 ) the study of this particular symmetry in spacetime is physically very important as it plays a crucial role of discovering conservation laws and to devise spacetime classification schemes , and ( 3 ) because of the highly non - linearity of the einstein field equations one can reduce easily the partial differential equations to ordinary differential equations by using ckv .    therefore , several works have been performed by use of the technique of conformal motion as can be seen available in the literature .",
    "a few interesting applications of conformal motion to astrophysical field can be found in the following refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in this line of investigations some special mention are of the very recent works of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "search for a new wormhole solution inspired by noncommutative geometry with the additional condition of allowing conformal killing vectors was performed by @xcite whereas @xcite have shown that a new class of interior solutions for anisotropic stars are possible by admitting conformal motion in higher - dimensional noncommutative spacetime .",
    "interior solutions admitting conformal motions also have been studied extensively in the past by herrera and his co - workers @xcite .    under this background ,",
    "therefore , in the present work our main aim or motivation is to construct a set of stellar solutions under @xmath0 theory of gravity by admitting conformal motion of killing vectors .",
    "the outline of the investigation is as follows : in the sec .",
    "2 we provide the basic mathematical formalism of @xmath0 theory whereas in sec .",
    "3 the ckvs are formulated .",
    "the einstein field equations under @xmath0 gravity and ckvs have been provided along with their solutions in sec .",
    "we have tested physical validity of the model by using tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation in sec .",
    "lastly , in sec . 6 we pass some concluding remarks .",
    "the action of @xmath0 theory is taken as ( for geometrical units g = c=1 ) @xmath2 = \\int d^4x \\left [ \\frac{1}{16 \\pi } f(t ) + l_{matter } ( \\phi_a )   \\right]\\label{eq1}.\\ ] ]    here , @xmath3 indicates matter fields and @xmath0 is an arbitrary analytic function of the torsion scalar @xmath4 .",
    "the torsion scalar is constructed from torsion and cotorsion as follows : @xmath5 where @xmath6    @xmath7    are torsion and cotorsion respectively with newly defined tensor components @xmath8    here , @xmath9 are the tetrad by which it is possible to define any metric as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "if one varies the action ( [ eq1 ] ) with respect to the tetrad , one can get the field equations of @xmath0 gravity which can be given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denotes the energy stress tensor of the anisotropic fluid as @xmath17 with @xmath18",
    "to search for a natural relationship between geometry and matter einstein s general relativity provides a rich arena to use symmetries .",
    "various symmetries that arising either from geometrical point of view or physical relevant quantities are known as collineations .",
    "the greatest advantageous collineations is the conformal killing vectors ( ckv ) which provide a deeper insight into the spacetime geometry . in mathematical point of view , conformal motions or conformal killing vectors ( ckv )",
    "are motions along which the metric tensor of a spacetime remains invariant up to a scale factor .",
    "another advantage to use the ckv is that it facilitates generation of exact solutions to the field equations .",
    "this is achieved by reducing the highly nonlinear partial differential equations of einstein s gravity to ordinary differential equations through the technique of ckv .",
    "the ckv can be defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the lie derivative operator of the metric tensor and @xmath21 is the conformal factor .",
    "it is supposed that the vector @xmath22 generates the conformal symmetry and the metric @xmath23 is conformally mapped onto itself along @xmath22 . however , it is to note that neither @xmath22 nor @xmath21 need to be static even though one considers a static metric  @xcite .",
    "further , one should note that ( i ) if @xmath24 then eq . ( 7 ) gives the killing vector , ( ii ) if @xmath25 constant it gives homothetic vector , and ( iii ) if @xmath26 then it yields conformal vectors .",
    "moreover , for @xmath24 the underlying spacetime becomes asymptotically flat which further implies that the weyl tensor will also vanish .",
    "therefore , ckv has an intrinsic property to provide a deeper insight of the underlying spacetime geometry .",
    "basically the lie derivative operator @xmath20 describes the interior gravitational field of a stellar configuration with respect to the vector field @xmath22 .",
    "let us therefore assume that our static spherically symmetric spacetime admits an one parameter group of conformal motion , so that the metric @xmath27 is conformally mapped onto itself along @xmath22",
    ".    here eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) implies that @xmath28 with @xmath29 .    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) , one can get the following expressions @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 stand for the spatial and temporal coordinates @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively .",
    "the above set of equations imply @xmath35 ^ 2 ,   \\label{eq11 } \\\\",
    "\\xi^i & = & c_1 \\delta_4^i + \\left[\\frac{\\psi r}{2}\\right]\\delta_1^i , \\label{eq12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 all are integration constants .",
    "let us define tetrad matrix for the metric ( [ eq8 ] ) as follows : @xmath39.\\label{eq13}\\ ] ]    therefore , the torsion scalar can be determined as @xmath40    inserting this and the components of the tensors @xmath41 and @xmath42 in eq .",

    "so that eventually as an equilibrium condition one can write it in the following form : @xmath103 where @xmath104 @xmath105 @xmath106    in case of @xmath107 and @xmath77 the gravitational and hydrostatic forces are given by @xmath108 and @xmath109    we have plotted the feature of tov equation for the sub - case _ 4.2.1 _ in fig . 5 ( we do nt need to include tov equation in the sub - case _ 4.1.1 _ as the model does not exist the energy conditions being violated ) . in this sub - case of _ 4.2.1 _ we observe that static equilibrium has been attained by the forces through balancing of the stresses between them .",
    "however , it can be found out that anisotropic forces have no contribution to equilibrium i.e. @xmath110 as @xmath111 .",

    "it can be seen by the clear ` cut ' on x - axis which is turned out to be 1.445 km ( fig .",
    "this is very small and indicates towards a compact star with ultra - compactness .",
    "a tally of this value with the already available data set immediately reveals that the star is nothing but either a quark / strange star ( see table 1 of the ref .",

    "we have studied in detail the @xmath0 gravity for the two specific cases @xmath120 and @xmath77 . it has specially been observed that among all the cases i and ii of @xmath0 gravity only the solutions of sub - case 4.2.1 with isotropic condition ( @xmath54 ) under case ii , i.e. @xmath77 are physically valid . in general , our observation is that under @xmath0 gravity anisotropy does nt exist as well as all the energy conditions become jeopardized .",
    "obviously , in favor of this conclusion further studies are needed to perform several other aspect of the @xmath0 theory of gravity .    in connection to features and hence validity of the model we have studied several physical aspects based on the solutions and all these being very interesting advocate in favor of physically acceptance of the model .",
    "we would like to summarize all these results as follows :    * ( i ) energy conditions *    our study reveals that only the solutions of sub - case 4.2.1 with isotropic condition under case ii i.e. @xmath77 are physically valid as in the other cases energy conditions are seen to be violated .    * ( ii ) tov equation *    the plot for the generalized tov equation shows that static equilibrium has been attained by the different forces , viz . gravitational force ( @xmath100 ) , hydrostatic force ( @xmath101 ) and anisotropic force ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "however , it is also observed that anisotropic forces have no role for equilibrium of the system .    * ( iii ) stability issue *    by employing the cracking concept of @xcite we have demonstrated through plot that the squares of the sound speed remains within the limit @xmath112 $ ] and hence shown our model is a stable one .    *",
    "( iv ) nature of the star *    the model with very high density ( @xmath118  gm / cc ) and small radius ( @xmath114  km ) suggests that the present investigation under @xmath0 theory of gravity is a representative of an ultra - compact star .",
    "we note an interesting work on the @xmath0 gravity in connection to @xcite metric parameters as done by @xcite .",
    "the present work therefore may be extended to that line of thinking in a future project .",
