    "sponsored search advertising is a significant growth market and is witnessing rapid growth and evolution .",
    "the analysis of the underlying models has so far primarily focused on the scenario , where advertisers / bidders interact directly with the auctioneers , i.e. , the search engines and publishers .",
    "however , the market is already witnessing the spontaneous emergence of several categories of companies who are trying to mediate or facilitate the auction process .",
    "for example , a number of different adnetworks have started proliferating , and so have companies who specialize in reselling ad inventories .",
    "hence , there is a need for analyzing the impact of such incentive driven and for - profit agents , especially as they become more sophisticated in playing the game . in the present work ,",
    "our focus is on the emergence of market mechanisms and for - profit agents motivated by capacity constraint inherent to the present models .",
    "for instance , one natural constraint comes from the fact that there is a limit on the number of slots available for putting ads , especially for the popular keywords , and a significant pool of advertisers are left out due to this capacity constraint .",
    "we ask whether there are sustainable market constructs and mechanisms , where new players interact with the existing auction mechanisms to increase the overall capacity .",
    "in particular , lead - generation companies who bid for keywords , draw traffic from search pages and then redirect such traffic to service / product providers , have spontaneously emerged .",
    "however , the incentive and equilibria properties of paid - search auctions in the presence of such profit - driven players have not been explored .",
    "we investigate key questions , including what happens to the overall revenue of the auctioneers when such mediators participate , what is the payoff of a mediator and how does it dependent on her quality , how are the payoffs of the bidders affected , and is there an overall value that is generated by such mechanisms .    formally , in the current models , there are @xmath0 slots to be allocated among @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) bidders ( i.e. the advertisers ) .",
    "a bidder @xmath3 has a true valuation @xmath4 ( known only to the bidder @xmath3 ) for the specific keyword and she bids @xmath5 . the expected _ click through rate _ ( ctr ) of an ad put by bidder @xmath3 when allocated slot @xmath6 has the form @xmath7 i.e. separable in to a position effect and an advertiser effect .",
    "@xmath8 s can be interpreted as the probability that an ad will be noticed when put in slot @xmath6 and it is assumed that @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 can be interpreted as the probability that an ad put by bidder @xmath3 will be clicked on if noticed and is refered as the _ relevance _ of bidder @xmath3 .",
    "the payoff / utility of bidder @xmath3 when given slot @xmath6 at a price of @xmath11 per click is given by @xmath12 and they are assumed to be rational agents trying to maximize their payoffs . as of now , google as well as yahoo ! uses schemes closely modeled as rbr(rank by revenue ) with gsp(generalized second pricing ) .",
    "the bidders are ranked according to @xmath13 and the slots are allocated as per this ranks . for simplicity of notation , assume that the @xmath3th bidder is the one allocated slot @xmath3 according to this ranking rule , then @xmath3 is charged an amount equal to @xmath14 .",
    "formal analysis of such sponsored search advertising model has been done extensively in recent years , from algorithmic as well as from game theoretic perspective@xcite .    in the following section , we propose and study a model wherein",
    "the additional capacity is provided by a for - profit agent who competes for a slot in the original auction , draws traffic and runs its own sub - auction for the added slots .",
    "we discuss the cost or the value of capacity by analyzing the change in the revenues due to added capacity as compared to the ones without added capacity .",
    "in this section , we discuss our model motivated by the capacity constraint , which can be formally described as follows :    * * primary auction ( @xmath11-auction ) :* mediators participate in the original auction run by the search engine ( called _ @xmath11-auction _ ) and compete with advertisers for slots ( called _ primary slots _ ) . for the @xmath3th agent ( an advertiser or a mediator ) , let @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote her true valuation and the bid for the @xmath11-auction respectively .",
    "further , let us denote @xmath17 by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the relevance score of @xmath3th agent for @xmath11-auction .",
    "let there are @xmath20 mediators and there indices are @xmath21 respectively . +",
    "* * secondary auctions ( @xmath22-auctions ) : * * * * secondary slots : * suppose that in the primary auction , the slots assigned to the mediators are @xmath23 respectively , then effectively , the additional slots are obtained by forking these _ primary slots _ in to @xmath24 additional slots respectively , where @xmath25 for all @xmath26 . by forking we mean the following : on the associated landing page the mediator puts some information relevant to the specific keyword associated with the @xmath11-auction along with the space for additional slots .",
    "let us call these additional slots as _ secondary slots_. + * * * properties of secondary slots and _ fitness _ of the mediators : * for the @xmath3th mediator , there will be a probability associated with her ad to be clicked if noticed , which is actually her relevence score @xmath27 and the position based ctrs might actually improve say by a factor of @xmath28 .",
    "this means that the position based ctr for the @xmath6th secondary slot of @xmath3th mediator in modeled as @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 otherwise .",
    "therefore , we can define a _",
    "@xmath32 for the @xmath3th mediator , which is equal to @xmath33 . thus corresponding to the @xmath34th primary slot ( the one being forked by the @xmath3th mediator ) ,",
    "the _ effective _ position based ctr for the @xmath6th secondary slot obtained is @xmath35 where @xmath36 note that @xmath37 , however @xmath32 could be greater than @xmath38 . + * * * @xmath22-auctions : * mediators run their individual sub - auctions ( called _ @xmath22-auctions _ ) for the secondary slots provided by them . for an advertiser",
    "there is another type of valuations and bids , the ones associated with @xmath22-auctions . for the @xmath3th agent ,",
    "let @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote her true valuation and the bid for the @xmath22-auction of @xmath6th mediator respectively .",
    "in general , the two types of valuations or bids corresponding to @xmath11-auction and the @xmath22-auctions might differ a lot .",
    "we also assume that @xmath41 and @xmath42 whenever @xmath3 is a mediator .",
    "further , for the advertisers who do not participate in one auction ( @xmath11-auction or @xmath22-auction ) , the corresponding true valuation and the bid are assumed to be zero . also , for notational convenience let us denote @xmath43 by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the relevance score of @xmath3th agent for the @xmath22-auction of @xmath6th mediator . + * * * payment models for @xmath22-auctions : * mediators could sell their secondary slots by impression ( ppm ) , by pay - per - click ( ppc ) or pay - per - conversion(ppa ) . in the following analysis , we consider ppc . +",
    "* * freedom of participation : * advertisers are free to bid for primary as well as secondary slots . + * * true valuations of the mediators : * the true valuation of the mediators are derived from the expected revenue ( total payments from advertisers ) they obtain from the corresponding @xmath22-auctions .",
    "for simplicity , let us assume participation of a single mediator and the analysis involving several mediators can be done in a similar fashion",
    ". for notational convenience let @xmath46    the @xmath11-auction as well as the @xmath22-auction is done via _ rbr _ with _ gsp _ , i.e. the mechanism currently being used by google and yahoo ! , and the solution concept we use is _ symmetric nash equilibria(sne)_@xcite .",
    "suppose the allocations for the @xmath11-auction and @xmath22-auction are @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively .",
    "then the payoff of the @xmath3th agent from the combined auction ( @xmath11-auction and @xmath22-auction together ) is    @xmath49    where @xmath50 from the mathematical structure of payoffs and strategies available to the bidders wherein two different uncorrelated values can be reported as bids in the two types of auctions independently of each other , it is clear that the equilibrium of the combined auction game is the one obtained from the equilibria of the @xmath11-auction game and the @xmath22-auction game each played in isolation . in particular at _ sne_@xcite , @xmath51 and @xmath52 which implies that ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : effec - ctr ] ) ) @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the true valuation of the mediator multiplied by her relevance score as per our definition , which is the expected revenue she derives from her @xmath22-auction _ ex ante _ given a slot in the @xmath11-auction and therefore the mediator s payoff at sne is    @xmath55",
    "in this section , we discuss the change in the revenue of the auctioneer due to the involvement of the mediator .",
    "the revenue of the auctioneer with the participation of the mediator is @xmath56 and similarly , the revenue of the auctioneer without the participation of the mediator is @xmath57 therefore , @xmath58    thus revenue of the auctioneer always increases by the involvement of the mediator . as we can note from the above expression , smaller the @xmath59 better the improvement in the revenue of the auctioneer . to ensure a smaller value of @xmath59 , the mediator s valuation which is the expected payments that she obtains from the @xmath22-auction should be better , therefore fitness factor @xmath60 should be very good .",
    "there is another way to improve her true valuation .",
    "the mediator could actually run many subauctions related to the specific keyword in question .",
    "this can be done as follows : besides providing the additional slots on the landing page , the information section of the page could contain links to other pages wherein further additional slots associated with a related keyword could be provided . with this variation of the model , a better value of @xmath59 could possibly be ensured leading to a win - win situation for everyone .    increasing the capacity via",
    "mediator improves the revenue of auctioneer .",
    "now let us turn our attention to the change in the efficiency and as we will prove below , the efficiency always improves by the participation of the mediator .",
    "@xmath61    @xmath62    increasing the capacity via mediator improves the efficiency .",
    "clearly , for the newly accommodated advertisers , that is the ones who lost in the @xmath11-auction but win a slot in @xmath22-auction , the payoffs increase from zero to a postitive number .",
    "now let us see where do these improvements in the revenue of the auctioneer , in payoffs of newly accommodated advertisers , and in the efficiency come from ?",
    "only thing left to look at is the change in the payoffs for the advertisers who originally won in the @xmath11-auction , that is the winners when there was no mediator .",
    "the new payoff for @xmath6th ranked advertiser in @xmath11-auction is @xmath63    where @xmath64 is her payoff from the @xmath22-auction .",
    "also , for @xmath65 , her payoff when there was no mediator is    @xmath66    similarly , for @xmath67 , her payoff when there was no mediator is @xmath68 therefore , in general we have , @xmath69    thus , for the @xmath6th ranked winning advertiser from the auction without mediation , the revenue from the @xmath11-auction decreases by @xmath70 and she faces a loss unless compensated for by her payoffs in @xmath22-auction .",
    "further , this payoff loss will be visible only to the advertisers who joined the auction game before the mediator and they are likely to participate in the @xmath22-auction so as to make up for this loss .",
    "thus , via the mediator , a part of the payoffs of the originally winning advertisers essentially gets distributed among the newly accommodated advertisers . however , when the mediator s fitness factor @xmath60 is very good , it might be a win - win situation for everyone .",
    "depending on how good the fitness factor @xmath60 is , sometimes the payoff from the @xmath22-auction might be enough to compensate for any loss by accommodating new advertisers .",
    "let us consider an extreme situation when @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "gain _ in payoff for the advertiser @xmath73 is @xmath74 therefore as long as @xmath75 the advertiser @xmath73 faces no net loss in payoff and might actually gain .",
    "in the present work , we have studied the emergence of diversification in the adword market triggered by the inherent capacity constraint . we proposed and analyzed a model where additional capacity is created by a for - profit agent who compete for a slot in the original auction ,",
    "draws traffic and runs its own sub - auction .",
    "our study potentially indicate a @xmath76-fold diversification in the adword market in terms of ( i ) the emergence of new market mechanisms , ( ii ) emergence of new for - profit agents , and ( iii ) involvement of a wider pool of advertisers .",
    "therefore , we should expect the internet economy to continue to develop richer structure , with room for different types of agents and mechanisms to coexist .",
    "in particular , capacity constraints motivates the study of yet another model where the additional capacity is created by the search engine itself , essentially acting as a mediator itself and running a single combined auction .",
