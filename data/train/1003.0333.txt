    "the recent progress in chemical synthesis , computational capabilities and scanning - probe techniques has permitted a detailed understanding of semiconductor nanocrystals ( ncs )  also known as nanoparticles , clusters , crystallites or quantum dots ( qds ) .",
    "their properties which depend on size @xcite and shape @xcite have overimposed effects due to quantum confinement .",
    "for instance , when the qd radius is smaller than the bohr radius of exciton , quantum - confinement effects appear , such as the blue shift of gaps and the discretization of energy spectra@xcite .",
    "the gap properties can also be tuned intentionally with doping@xcite .",
    "recently , much effort has focused on ii - vi semiconductor ncs doped with magnetic impurities such as mn , which is the topic of this work .",
    "the mn doping is motivated by diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dmss ) .",
    "these compounds are bulk semiconductors doped with transition - metal impurities such as cr , mn , fe and co at low concentrations .",
    "dmss are current research materials in spintronics , integrated in novel magnetoelectronic devices such as spin - leds@xcite .",
    "their remarkable magnetic and magneto - optical properties result from the strong _ sp - d _ exchange interactions between band carriers and mn ions@xcite .",
    "these interactions yield giant band - edge splittings at low temperature ( about 100 mev)@xcite .",
    "in particular , little is known theoretically about exchange in ncs made of ii - vi dmss doped with mn .",
    "dms ncs of type ii - vi doped with mn have been successfully synthesized and characterized during the last fifteen years .",
    "these works found at zero field , or low fields , contradictory results for the zeeman splitting . in comparison with bulks ,",
    "several authors have shown a reduction of the excitonic zeeman splitting in mn - doped cds@xcite , cdse@xcite and cdte@xcite ncs .",
    "other works revealed no enhancement of the excitonic zeeman splitting in co - doped zno , znse and cds qds@xcite in comparison with their bulk values .",
    "magnetic circular dichroism and optical experiments with mn - doped znse ncs revealed a value for the same splitting of 28 mev , much larger than in bulk znse : mn @xcite .",
    "the zeeman splittings are due on one hand to the confinement - enhanced _ sp - d _ hybridization between the occupied mn 3__d _ _ orbitals and the _ sp_-type valence states of the host compound ; and on the other hand to the crystal field experienced by mn impurities , which is significantly different nearer the nc surface than in bulk@xcite .",
    "experimentally , several authors found that mn atoms are embedded in znse ncs @xcite , and even a single mn impurity is inside cdte nanocrystals @xcite .",
    "theoretically , enhanced splittings are obtained in znse : mn ncs within the effective mass approximation@xcite with a single mn sitting at the center . however , there is little theoretical information about exchange interactions and splittings for cdte : mn ncs , and even less with mn off - center .",
    "we also note that the dms ncs can hold inside several mn impurities .    in the present work we study mn - doped cdte ncs of spherical shape with the density functional theory . in section",
    "[ computational ] we give a brief account of the theorical framework and numerical details .",
    "the host compound is a well - known wide - gap semiconductor of type ii - vi , and manganese is a widely - used dopant , known for activating photo- and electroluminescence , and also for contributing to efficient luminescence centers ( 3__d _ _ electrons ) @xcite .",
    "several authors have previously calculated the properties of bulk ii - vi cdte doped with mn@xcite .",
    "we consider two doping situations : ncs including one and two mn impurities , which substitute for one or two cd atoms in the zinc blende lattice , respectively . in section [ nanosingle ]",
    "the results concerning ncs with a single mn impurity are given .",
    "the results for nc with two impurities are described in section [ nanotwo ] .",
    "we calculate the total ground - state energy of the qd , for several positions of impurities within the crystal and the magnetic state .",
    "moreover , we obtain the _ sp - d _ and _ d - d _ exchange constants@xcite as a function of the mn locations : @xmath3 and @xmath4 stand for the exchange interactions between the mn local moments and the _ s_- and _ p_-type band - edge states of the host cdte ; @xmath7 parametrizes the exchange interaction between two mn spins .",
    "finally , we sum up the main findings and concluding remarks in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the system described here may provide further understanding of solid - state qubits , since it permits to detect and manipulate a single spin@xcite .",
    "in addition it could show magnetic and magneto - optical properties , such as fast recombination and high luminescence efficiency @xcite .",
    "the many - body problem for the electrons around the nuclei is solved based on the density functional theory ( dft ) , using the kohn - sham equations .",
    "the valence electrons move in the external potential created by the nuclei and the core electrons .",
    "the electronic states of the studied ncs are obtained from the projector augmented - wave method as implemented in the vasp code @xcite . to account for the _ sp - d _",
    "hybridization@xcite the ten 3__d _ _ spin - orbitals of mn impurities are included in our calculations . within dft",
    ", our approach for the exchange - correlation is defined with the generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew , burke and ernzerhof@xcite . however , the interactions among the @xmath8 electrons of mn impurities in the gga approximation are only partially described , since they are strongly localized .",
    "thus , we use the so - called gga+__u _ _ scheme and introduce in the calculations two common correction parameters , _ u _ and _ j _ @xcite . for mn atoms in cdte bulk , @xmath9 ev and @xmath10 ev .",
    "they are considered to correct the coulomb ( _ u _ ) and exchange ( _ j _ ) interactions among the 3__d _ _ electrons at mn sites@xcite .",
    "we have checked that with the @xmath11 values of refs .   and for mn , the density of states are very similar , especially the @xmath12 peak corresponding to mn is nearly at the same energy .",
    "this peak is below the @xmath13-type part of the cdte valence band .",
    "we have chosen the recent @xmath11 value in ref .   because it calculated mnte bulk where mn is surrounded by te .",
    "additionally , tests on bulk mnte with the same lattice constant of ref .   show nearly the same band structures when using lsda or gga and the same @xmath11 value .",
    "the input parameters for the vasp calculations are determined in a preliminary work for two model bulk systems , cdte and f - mnte ( zinc blende ) . for several lattice constants we fitted the ground - state energies to the murnaghan s equation of state , which depends on the unit cell volume .",
    "the equilibrium lattice constants of bulks cdte and f - mnte are @xmath14   and @xmath15   . the cut - off energy in the plane wave basis set is 350 ev ; this is the shared cut - off to converge the ground - state energies of both cdte and f - mnte bulks within mev .",
    "the studied ncs are spherical about @xmath16   in diameter centered on a cation site ( cd ) .",
    "the crystal structure is zinc blende , which has tetrahedral ( @xmath17 ) symmetry around the atoms .",
    "these qds are passivated since otherwise the surface dangling bonds would introduce surface states in the near - gap spectrum .",
    "organic ligands are commonly used to passivate ncs , but we want to center on the intrinsic properties of ncs @xcite . for the sake of simplicity we resort to the simplest passivation agent : a pseudohydrogen atom ( h@xmath18 ) .",
    "the fictitious h@xmath18 is characterized by fractional electronic charge and by a proton with the same charge but positive . every cd ( 5@xmath19 ) dangling bond includes 2/4 unpaired electrons , so it is bound to a pseudohydrogen atom with a fictitious charge of 6/4 _ e_. similarly , every te dangling bond ( @xmath20 ) is bound to a pseudohydrogen atom with an electronic charge of 2/4 _ e_. when the pseudohydrogen atoms h@xmath18 are included the ncs have 107 atoms in total : @xmath21 cd , @xmath22 te and @xmath23 h@xmath18 .",

    "the cation sites of the nc are distributed in three sets , and labeled as `` i '' for the sphere center , `` ii '' for other inner positions and `` iii '' for outside positions .",

    "the substitutional energies are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : esfera ] ( b ) for the positions i , ii , and iii .",
    "all the energies are endothermic .",
    "this means that the synthesis of these ncs requires high temperatures as shown in experiments @xcite .",
    "the changes in @xmath31 show opposite trends to the qd calculated total energies as a function of mn site .",
    "the lowest - energy sites belong to group iii with mn atoms close to the surface ; the outward sites are the most stable positions for the impurity .",
    "this outward stability is consistent with other results for magnetic impurities in other semiconductor nanoscale objects , such as nanowires @xcite .    in the output geometry ,",
    "the nearest - neighbor distances to the mn impurity are about 2 % smaller than the cd - te distance for the undoped nc .",
    "this contraction effect depends strongly on the exchange - correlation approach .",
    "the neighbor mn - cd distances at the gga level contract by more than 4 % respect to the bulk cd - te distance . however , when relaxing the geometries with the + @xmath11 scheme the distances expand closer to the unrelaxed input cd - te distances .",
    "this result could justify the use of unrelaxed cd - te distances in other works about mn doping , but in principle this agreement seems fortuitous .",
    "we analyze next the origin of magnetism as we are dealing with mn , that typically is a magnetic element . the total magnetic moment associated with the qd",
    "is 5 @xmath1 , as expected since the mn dopant introduces five spin - up electrons .",

    "this behavior is in disagreement with other previous results concerning cdte : mn bulk @xcite , where the te and mn moments are found to be parallel .",
    "the mn magnetic moment is lower than 5 @xmath1 because of the _ sp - d _ hybridization between the localized 3__d _ _ electrons of mn impurity and the delocalized _ s_- and _ p_-type valence states of cdte host .",

    "[ fig : dos ] . quantum confinement in qds produces a blue shift of the gap and all the related optical properties , such as excitons .",
    "the gaps calculated using lda or gga approximations are well known to underestimate the experimental values .",
    "the calculated gap of cdte bulk is 0.69 ev which is lower than in experiments , 1.48 ev . our calculated homo - lumo gap in the cd - te qd is 2.59 ev , which shows the predicted blue shift .",
    "all these findings are well established in semiconductor qds .",
    "however , the homo - lumo gap of the cdte dot doped with mn and within the + @xmath11 approach remains almost constant to 2.62 ev [ see fig . [",
    "fig : dos ] ( a ) ] when mn is in the center .",
    "we note that the gga approach understimates the gap and becomes 2.04 ev .",

    "the _ sp - d _ hybridization is studied using the local density of states ( ldos ) projected into the orbitals of mn impurity and of nearest - neighbor te atoms .",
    "the main peak of mn @xmath12-states appears below the @xmath13 part valence band . due to the tetrahedral symmetry in cdte lattice ,",
    "the five spin - up mn electrons are split into a triplet of @xmath41 symmetry and a doublet of _ e _ symmetry .",

    "hence , the _ s - d _ exchange interaction arises mainly from coulomb repulsion and the pauli exclusion principle@xcite , and originates the spin splitting of these states .",
    "this splitting is thus always ferromagnetic , and its exchange constant @xmath3 is positive .",
    "on the contrary , the valence band - edge states of the cdte are _ p_-type and allowed to hybridize fully with the mn 3__d _ _ orbitals .",
    "anyhow such _",
    "p - d _ hybridization is small and yields an effective exchange mechanism of interaction between mn atoms @xcite .",
    "this exchange is related to the opposite polarization between the valence band - edge states and the mn 3__d _ _ orbitals .",

    "when the impurity is located off - center , the exchange constants are smaller than the bulk values and they tend to zero as the impurity approaches the surface .",
    "this finding is explained because the mn bond is expected to be less covalent when mn is located near the surface , where it is less bulk - like .",
    "this site dependence of the exchange constants seems to have implications for random distribution of ncs . when there is a collection of qds , and each containing a single mn impurity randomly placed , the average @xmath56 would be significantly reduced in comparison with the bulk intrinsic zeeman splitting",
    "this decrease fits in the previous theoretical results @xcite .",
    "the decrease of the exchange splitting is correlated with a smaller cdte dot density around mn .",
    "thus , a further density analysis of band - edge states will be needed .",
    "though the detailed wavefunctions , as we have seen , are not required in the study of exchange interaction parameters , we must clearly attribute them to the electron and the hole effective states which reflect the character of the conduction and valence states in the ncs doped with mn .",

    "the up homo comes from the nearest - neighbor te atoms and is larger than from any other te atom . although more delocalized , the up lumo has larger contributions in the cd atoms and in the center site , which is mn or cd for doped or undoped dots respectively .",
    "these spatial distributions reflect the te and mn local dos character for the homo and lumo commented in the previous sections .    however , the homo and lumo down states are different from the undoped ncs .",
    "for the down states we see that the mn placed in the center expels charge , which is quantified by integrating it around the sphere center in figs .",
    "[ fig : hl ] ( e ) and ( f ) .",
    "this effect is much larger for the homo than for the lumo , see insets .",
    "this difference can be explained partially because the homo state is occupied , and mainly because the lumo state does not hybridize with the mn states , as shown in the previous dos plot [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] ] , which means that it has lower interaction with the @xmath12-electrons of mn .",
    "the down homo state undergoes the strongest change in comparison with its undoped counterpart because the undoped homo is mainly in the nearest - neighbor te to the central mn , with which the mn must couple antiferromagnetically .    to end this section we comment the density of the homo and lumo states for off - center mn .",
    "they are plotted for the position ii in fig .",

    "there is larger mixing in the lumos which makes that both up and down states remove charge from the mn neighborhood .",
    "the general form of the rest of the lumos resembles those of the sphere without mn .",
    "the homos with off - center mn suffer larger differences with respect to the undoped case , specially for the down component .",
    "anyhow , we see a depletion of charge around central mn mainly for the down part",
    ". these larger differences for the homo are due to two reasons : ( i ) the stronger mixing of states in a structure with lower symmetry for mn off - center , and ( ii ) the small value for the undoped charge density out of the dot center .",
    "the latter means that when mn is off - center , the states can suffer naturally stronger perturbations .",

    "[ fig : ec-2 ] ( a ) .",
    "the largest value in modulus is roughly 1.5 k for mn atoms on sites i and ii .",
    "it is about four times smaller than the absolute value of the experimental exchange constant in bulk @xmath6 , 6.1 k. in addition we can see the dependence with the mn - mn sites . for mn - mn intermediate distances ,",
    "the exchange constants decrease even further and they are following the afm - fm splitting .",
    "note that for the mn atoms in the center and surface positions this splitting seems to be very small .",
    "we have also examined the @xmath12-levels for several of these mn - mn configurations , although they are not given here . due to symmetry in qds , the @xmath12-levels in position i and ii are close , but in different energy panels [ as seen in previous fig .",
    "[ fig : vsi ] ] .",
    "this means that the symmetry considerations are more relevant in qds to understand the mn - mn interaction that higher - order mechanisms , such as superexchange or double exchange",
    ". we must remember that such mechanisms are important for dms bulks where the @xmath12-levels are at the same energies , due the equal density around mn atoms .",
    "these symmetry considerations and the smaller dot density around mn atoms explain the lower coupling @xmath7 constants .",
    "( color online ) ( a ) substitutional energy of two mn positions .",
    "( b ) interaction energy @xmath82 for various mn - mn pairs .",
    "it shows the difference between the previous total mn - mn energy and the sum of single mn energies in the nc . ]",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath4 exchange constants are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ec-2 ] ( b ) .",
    "they are calculated for the ferromagnetic ( circles ) and antiferromagnetic ( squares ) states for several mn - mn positions ; the dopant concentration is @xmath87 . as in the previous section ,",
    "the exchange constants get closer to the bulk experimental values when one of the mn impurities occupies the nc center ( i - ii and i - iii ) , and they tend to zero when the mn ions separate from each other and approach the surface .",
    "the exchange constants for antiferromagnetic cases with high symmetry are also zero because the down and the up electrons are fully degenerated . when comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : dos2 ] with fig .",
    "[ fig : ec-2 ] , we conclude that the largest exchange values are obtained for ncs doped only with a mn impurity in the central site .",
    "the relative orientation of @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the same as before .",
    "however their values decrease by at least 0.2 ev .",
    "this difference can be ascribed to the second mn atom that cancels partially the coupling to the conduction and valence bands in the neighborhood of the first mn .",

    "are given in k to compare with the bibliography .",
    "exchange splittings follow the notation of fig .",
    "4 : circle marks with dotted lines ( green ) denote fm alignments ; and square marks with dashed lines ( blue ) , afm alignments . ]",
    "the valence states around the edges allow us , like in the case of a single mn impurity analysis , to understand the origin of the exchange in the cdte states .",
    "as it has been done before , they are plotted for the asymmetric mn - mn configuration i - ii in fig .",
    "[ fig : vsi - ii ] and for the symmetric one ii - ii in fig .",
    "[ fig : vsii - ii ] .",
    "however , due to magnetic coupling there are more options than in one mn impurity case .",
    "thus the panels ( a ) denote the fm mn alignments ; and the panels ( b ) , the afms .",
    "we shall see that for the results of both figures , a perturbation theory of the central mn case rationalizes also the level breaking as due to symmetry and magnetic configuration .",
    "we therefore start the discussion by considering the afm case i - ii in fig . [",
    "fig : vsi - ii ] ( b ) .",
    "we see that the exchange splitting of the cdte aligns with the mn in position i. let us consider that a mn in position ii perturbs the levels to first order , as in previous one mn impurity .",
    "now , we can focus on the change in splitting of the three - fold degenerate levels using the previous results . in this way ,",
    "the down cdte valence - band edge levels are @xmath62 at low energy , and nearly degenerate @xmath60 and @xmath61 at higher energies .",
    "for the up levels this order is reversed .",
    "this order is also followed by our computations .",
    "the expected and calculated levels are in excellent agreement and thus confirm that a perturbative approach applies to the splitting of cdte levels by central mn .",
    "however , the case afm i - ii we have discussed , in which the perturbative approach can be applied , is not the only case of physical interest . in the fm case ,",
    "[ fig : vsi - ii ] ( a ) for example , both mn reinforce their splitting of the cdte states .",
    "the value is close to the sum of both i and ii splittings for the mn impurities on their own .",
    "we shall not go into further detail here .",
    "for the case ii - ii we only draw attention to the fact that there is strong interaction for one up mn impurity with the cdte down states .",
    "we can see the empty space of up ( down ) orbitals around the down ( up ) mn in fig .",
    "[ fig : vsii - ii ] ( b ) as it expels the surrounding charge .",
    "we want to stress here that for the fm case in fig .",
    "[ fig : vsii - ii ] ( a ) we need to go beyond the previous simple perturbative analysis . in spite of the strong perturbation ,",
    "it means that it is more difficult to interpret the data as coming from a perturbation due to a second impurity .",
    "it remains true that there is a clear increase of the splitting of @xmath62 orbital aligned along the corresponding mn - mn direction .",

    "the global densities are given nearest the corresponding states .",
    "the notation concerning atom labeling and density cuts follows the one given in previous figures . at the bottom",
    ", a scheme of mn magnetic moments is shown .",

    "in summary , we have investigated the electronic and magnetic properties of ( cd , mn)te nanocrystals of spherical shape with the density functional theory .",
    "the embedded mn impurities substitute cd atoms in the zinc blende lattice .",
    "the qds are @xmath0 nm in diameter , centered on a cation site ( cd ) , and they have a total of 107 atoms . the cd and te dangling bonds on the surface are passivated by pseudohydrogen atoms ( @xmath88 ) , which are the simplest model for a real organic ligand .",
    "we have studied two doping situations : ncs including one and two mn impurities .    in the first case",
    "we find that the configuration with the mn atom near the surface presents the lowest energy .",
    "the mn impurity introduces five _ d_-type spin - up electrons within the nc , thus the total magnetic moment associated with the qd is 5 @xmath2 , as expected .",
    "the local mn magnetic moment is 4.65 @xmath2 .",
    "it is smaller than 5 @xmath2 because of the _ s , p - d _ hybridization .",
    "also the mn - nearest - neighbor te sites show small magnetic moments antiferromagnetically coupled to the mn moment . furthermore , we look at the hybridization in the density of states .",
    "we calculate the _ sp - d _ exchange constants for various mn locations .",
    "the exchange constants are comparable to the bulk ones when the impurity is at the center , and they go to zero when the mn is close to the nc surface . then , for central mn we introduce spatially the homo and lumo states to verify that the largest change is for the down homo , which also justifies the antiferromagnetic alignment of the nearest - neighbor te atoms .",
    "additionally , we check the role of symmetry by looking at the cdte levels near the valence - band edge .",
    "this allows us a clear interpretation of the origin of exchange splitting .",
    "the @xmath62 levels in the mn diplacement direction suffer the stronger hybridizaton , while the @xmath60 and @xmath61 levels remain almost unsplit .",
    "thus , the exchange contants are roughly half of the central mn case .    in the second case",
    "we calculate the total ground - state energy as a function of mn - mn positions and the magnetic configuration of their local magnetic moments . in the minimum - energy state",
    "the mn dopants are on the surface , as far apart as possible , and antiferromagnetically coupled .",
    "we calculate the _ sp - d _ and _ d - d _ exchange constants for various mn - mn locations .",
    "we find that the exchange constants @xmath3 and @xmath4 are comparable to the corresponding bulk values when impurities occupy central bulk - like positions ( i - ii ) .",
    "they tend to zero as they separate from each other or approach the surface . as for the exchange @xmath5 , its largest value is for the mn ions placed in central bulk - like sites ( i - ii ) , and is four times smaller than in the bulk with similar mn concentration .",
    "a similar analysis of states nearest the valence - band edge demonstrates that a perturbative approach seems to be valid , with exception of the ii - ii fm configuration ."
