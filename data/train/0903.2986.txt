    "one of the favourite candidates for the dark matter in the universe is weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , of which neutralinos that arise in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model is a popular example ( see _ e.g. _  ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "if wimps are the dark matter in the universe , they will be abundant in the milky way halo where they can produce annihilation radiation ( gamma rays , neutrinos , positrons , antiprotons , antideutrons ,  ) that can be searched for with _",
    "e.g. _  the pamela @xcite and fermi @xcite satellites .",
    "the wimps can also scatter in heavy objects like the sun @xcite , where they can lose enough energy to be captured gravitationally and eventually sink to the core . once in the core",
    ", they can annihilate and produce _",
    "neutrinos that can be searched for with neutrino telescopes like super - kamiokande @xcite , icecube @xcite and antares @xcite .",
    "another route to search for the wimps is direct detection experiments where one tries to observe wimp scatterings on a detector target .",
    "for both the neutrino signal from the sun and the direct detection experiments , the strength of the signal depends crucially on either the spin - independent and/or the spin - dependent wimp - nucleon scattering cross - section . currently , xenon10 @xcite and cdms @xcite place the most stringent direct limits on the spin - independent scattering cross - section , whereas kims @xcite and coupp @xcite put the most stringent direct limits on the spin - dependent scattering cross - section .",
    "however , as the neutrino signal from the sun as searched for by neutrino telescopes also depends strongly on these cross - sections , we can use these searches to put limits on the same scattering cross - sections .",
    "this is of course more involved than for direct detection experiments as we need to consider the capture in the sun , the subsequent annihilation , production of neutrinos , propagation , interaction and oscillation of neutrinos , and finally scattering near the neutrino telescope to produce observable muons ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "most of these steps can be done in a fairly straightforward approach under reasonable assumptions , and the limit derived on the spin - dependent scattering cross - section is highly competitive with those from direct detection experiments .",
    "a similar analysis was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , but those results need updating , mainly because neutrino oscillations change the neutrino fluxes , but also because better modelling of hadronization / decay of quark jets affect the results",
    ". we will here perform a more detailed study , including full three flavour neutrino oscillations . for this",
    ", we will use the wimpsim @xcite wimp annihilation monte carlo as built into darksusy  @xcite 5.0.3 , and derive conversion factors to go from limits on the muon flux from neutrino telescopes to limits on the spin - independent and spin - dependent wimp - proton scattering cross - sections . at the end",
    ", we will apply these on the recent results from super - kamiokande @xcite and icecube @xcite .",
    "the correlation between signals in direct detection experiments and neutrino telescopes was also investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , in an analysis based on the results in @xcite , but adding annual modulation to the picture . in another recent paper @xcite",
    ", the correlation between neutrino telescopes and direct detection experiments was revisited for light wimp dark matter ( below 20 gev ) .",
    "we will here be more general than in that paper and focus on a wide range of wimp masses .",
    "as there are many assumptions needed to calculate the neutrino flux from the scattering cross - section , we will do this in two ways .",
    "first , we will focus on a ` standard ' calculation , with reasonable assumptions usually made in the literature .",
    "we will then go through some of these assumptions and perform a conservative calculation where we instead change our assumptions to see how low fluxes we can reasonably get for given scattering cross - sections .      the number of neutralinos in the sun , @xmath2 , is described by the differential equation @xmath3 where the three constants describe capture ( @xmath4 ) , annihilation ( @xmath5 ) , and evaporation ( @xmath6 ) . for the masses of interest here ,",
    "the evaporation is small and can be neglected @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath4 depends on the scattering cross - sections on the elements in the sun , whereas @xmath5 depends on the annihilation cross - section .",
    "the neutralino annihilation rate @xmath7 is then @xmath8 where the present rate is found for @xmath9 years .",
    "when @xmath10 annihilation and capture are in equilibrium , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 thus , in equilibrium , @xmath7 only depends on the capture rate @xmath4 , _",
    "@xmath7 only depends on the scattering cross - sections , and not on the annihilation cross - section . from @xmath7",
    "it is then straightforward ( but tedious ) to calculate the resulting muon flux at a neutrino telescope for a given wimp annihilation channel .    for the capture ( @xmath4 ) and annihilation ( @xmath5 ) we follow the treatment in ref .  @xcite as implemented in darksusy @xcite . in short",
    ", we have to integrate the wimp scatterings over the volume of the sun and the velocity of the wimps in the galactic halo and will here review the most essential steps in this calculation .    for the velocity of the wimps , we will here assume that it follows a maxwellian distribution , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the velocity of the wimp ( outside the potential well of the sun ) , @xmath15 = 220 km / s is the velocity of the sun relative to the halo , @xmath16 = 270 km / s is the wimp velocity dispersion , and @xmath17 is the wimp number density .",
    "we assume that the local wimp density is 0.3 @xmath18 . at a given interaction point in the sun ,",
    "the wimp velocity is given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the escape velocity at that point .",

    "@xcite , where we take the solar model bs2005-op as our default choice . for elements heavier than oxygen",
    ", the solar model bs2005-op only gives the total abundance and we use the relative abundances as given in ref .",
    "@xcite for these . in total",
    ", we include the 16 most important elements up to nickel .",
    "we can calculate the spin - independent ( si ) cross section on a nucleus with mass number @xmath36 , @xmath37 , as @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the si wimp - proton scattering cross - section .    for the spin - dependent ( sd ) wimp - proton cross - section @xmath40",
    ", hydrogen is the most important element in the sun , and we can neglect the heavier elements in this case .",

    "we perform this calculation with wimpsim @xcite including interactions , neutrino oscillations and regeneration of neutrinos from tau decay .",
    "we have performed these simulations with the neutrino oscillation parameters @xcite ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 but our results are not very sensitive to the exact choice of these parameters .",
    "the results of these wimpsim simulations are included in darksusy @xcite as easy to use tables and interpolation routines . for our purpose here",
    ", we use a muon energy threshold of 1 gev as this is how most neutrino telescopes report their results .",
    "we will also use the muon fluxes without any angular cut on the muons .",
    "we then have all the necessary ingredients to calculate the flux of muons ( or neutrinos ) in a neutrino telescope from any given wimp scattering and annihilation cross - sections .",
    "however , for the neutrino telescope limits to be really competitive , we need to have a situation where we have equilibrium between annihilation and capture as discussed above ( _ i.e. _  we need to have @xmath64 years ) .",
    "if we do not have equilibrium , neutrino telescope limits will still constrain wimp models , but we lose the direct correlation between the neutrino - induced muon fluxes and the scattering cross - sections . to investigate this further , we need to look at specific wimp models and we will here focus on the neutralino that arises as a natural wimp dark matter candidate in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model for particle physics , like the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "we have made extensive scans of the mssm model parameters both in msugra models and low - energy phenomenological mssm-7 and mssm-9 models ( in these models , we specify the supersymmetric parameters at the electroweak scale instead of at the gut scale as in msugra , see @xcite for details ) . in fig .",

    "we indicate for which models we do have equilibrium between capture and annihilation and for which we do not . for all models with high fluxes that are currently probed and will be probed in the near future by neutrino telescopes , equilibrium is fulfilled and we will from now on assume that we do have equilibrium . for hypothetical scenarios where this assumption would be invalid , it is straightforward to rescale our results with the @xmath66 factor given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammaa ] ) above .",
    "we also note that for another popular class of models , kaluza - klein dark matter in universal extra dimensions ( ued ) @xcite , we also always have equilibrium or near equilibrium between capture and annihilation .",
    "navely , we do expect to have equilibrium for models that can be probed with currently planned experiments , as the annihilation cross - section that enters @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) is constrained by the relic density constraint to be of the order of @xmath68 @xmath69 s@xmath70 .",
    "the above examples for mssm and ued confirm that this is the case for these specific models .",
    "the calculation above includes ` standard ' assumptions both from particle physics and astrophysics .",
    "however , we want to use the neutrino telescope results to put a limit on the scattering cross - section .",
    "hence , we need to investigate processes that can affect our results .",
    "in particular we want to investigate the processes that can reduce the neutrino fluxes since a reduction would mean that our limits on the scattering cross - sections would be increase ( _ i.e. _  they would have been too optimistic ) .",
    "first of all , there are some uncertainties in the solar model , especially regarding the abundances of heavy elements . in a conservative setup ,",
    "we instead focus on the solar model bs2005-ags , op @xcite which includes new lower estimates of the abundances of the heavier elements ( for the actual relative abundance we use the estimates in @xcite for heavier elements than oxygen ) .",
    "this will not affect capture via spin - dependent scattering as this occurs on hydrogen , whose abundance is well - known .",
    "it will however reduce capture via spin - independent scattering , especially for heavier wimps ( heavier than a few hundred gev ) , where capture on the heavier elements is important .",
    "another effect that can reduce the capture rate is gravitational effects from the planets , especially jupiter , during the capture process @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was estimated that for low scattering cross - sections , the life time of wimp orbits after the first scattering in the sun is quite long ( _ i.e. _  it takes a long time before they scatter again and eventually sink to the core ) .",
    "if the wimp orbit reaches out to jupiter , there is a large probability that jupiter will affect the orbit and disturb it so that it no longer passes through the sun and eventually throws the wimp out of the solar system back into the milky way halo . to get a conservative estimate of this effect , we have modified the capture expressions above so that wimps that reach out to jupiter after the first scatter in the sun will be considered as not captured",
    "this reduces capture , especially for heavy wimps and especially for scattering on light elements in the sun ( _ i.e. _  it is more pronounced for spin - dependent scattering ) . for 1 ( 10 )",
    "tev wimps the reduction is about 13% ( 87% ) for spin - dependent capture and about 1% ( 12% ) for spin - independent capture .",
    "the form factors introduce another source of uncertainty in the spin - independent capture , and the usually assumed helm - gould form factors are rather approximate ( but convenient to use ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effect of different form factors on direct detection rates was investigated and the conclusion was that the total scattering rate could change by up to about 20% with more accurate form factors . for our conservative estimate , we will here use the helm - lewin - smith form factors @xcite , which for mass number @xmath36 are given by    @xmath71~\\cdot 10^{-15 } \\mbox{~m}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    another source of uncertainty is of course the local dark matter density and velocity distribution . for our conservative estimate",
    ", we keep the local halo density fixed to @xmath72 gev/@xmath69 as for the standard calculation , as it is easy to rescale our results for other densities .",
    "the local wimp density also enters in the same way for direct detection experiments , so it does not affect the conversion factors below .",
    "a bigger concern is the velocity distribution as direct detection experiments are more sensitive to high velocity wimps ( as they produce larger energy nuclear recoils ) , whereas the capture process in the sun is more efficient for low velocity wimps .",
    "n - body simulations indicate ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) that dark matter halos probably are both anisotropic and deviates from the simple maxwellian form .",
    "however , dynamical constraints @xcite indicate that they can not change by too much and still be consistent with observations .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume though , that the velocity distribution is not that different from a maxwellian distribution , that it would reduce the capture in the sun by more than a factor of two . for our conservative estimate ,",
    "we have though not included the effects of changing the velocity distribution , as there is yet no consensus on how different it could be and still be compatible with observations .",
    "there is also a recent proposal @xcite that there might be a dark matter disk in the milky way in addition to the regular dark matter halo .",
    "this disk could have a local density of ( 0.251.5 ) @xmath73 and would corotate with the stars in the galaxy .",
    "the velocity distribution of this population would therefore be peaked at much lower velocities than the regular halo , which would cause very little change in direct detection experiments ( except if the energy thresholds could be reduced ) , but would increase the capture rate in the sun by maybe one order of magnitude @xcite . the existence of this dark matter disk is still debated and as it increases the capture rate instead of decreasing it , we do not include it in our conservative estimate . we just want to point out that if such a disk exists , the neutrino telescopes could be even more sensitive than the standard calculation gives .",
    "we are now ready to calculate our results and will first focus on the conversion rates from muon flux limits to scattering cross - section limits",
    ". we will then compare with earlier calculations and at the end we will apply our conversion factors on the current best limits from neutrino telescopes and compare with direct detection experiments .      if we assume that one annihilation channel dominates ( _ i.e. _  assuming @xmath74 for some annihilation channel @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : muflux ] ) ) we can relate the observed muon flux @xmath75 to the annihilation rate @xmath76 using the functions @xmath77 , shown for four ( extreme ) channels in fig .",
    "[ fig : fovera ] .",
    "these values are the same in the standard and conservative calculations .",
    "note that for a specific wimp model , we typically know the branching fractions @xmath78 , but for general wimps , we do not have this knowledge and in extreme cases the uncertainty coming from this lack of knowledge could be about an order of magnitude as seen in the fig .",
    "[ fig : fovera ] .",
    "however , for most wimp models , the uncertainty is usually much smaller than this . for supersymmetric neutralinos , the branching fraction to hard channels is typically @xmath79 for @xmath80 ,",
    "so the sum of @xmath81 s is typically rather close ( within a factor of a few ) to the values for a hard channel like @xmath82 .",
    "for kaluza - klein dark matter in models of universal extra dimensions , the branching fractions are rather well - known and with a large hard contribution .",
    "hence , for most realistic models , @xmath81 is closer to the hard channels like @xmath82 than the soft ones like @xmath83 . to get a really conservative limit",
    ", we could use the soft @xmath83 channel as an extreme case , but we have here chosen to present results for these different channels separately .    further on , to get a conservative limit on either the spin - independent or spin - dependent scattering cross - section , we assume that either one of these dominates capture .",
    "we can then through eqs .",
    "( [ eq : c_tot ] ) and ( [ eq : chia ] ) get the wimp - proton scattering cross - sections @xmath39 or @xmath40 as a function of @xmath7 @xmath84 for functions @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we can then finally relate the cross - section to the muon flux , as @xmath87 the conversion factors @xmath88 and @xmath89 between cross - section and muon flux are shown for four annihilation channels in fig .",
    "[ fig : soverf ] for the standard and conservative calculations . for the si case , we note that the main effect of the conservative calculation is to increase @xmath90 due to the different form factor . at higher masses , the lower abundances of heavy elements and the effect of jupiter increases slightly further . for the sd case , we see essentially no differences between the two calculations at low masses as the only significant difference between the calculations in this case is the reduction of capture due to jupiter , that starts increasing @xmath91 at high masses .    the conversion factors in fig .",
