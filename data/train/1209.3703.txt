    "phosphorescent organometallic dyes have attracted considerable interest over the last few decades as highly efficient sensitizers in organic light - emitting diodes ( oleds )  @xcite .",
    "these complexes are characterized by strong spin - orbit coupling due to heavy transition metals in their core , such as ir , pt , and os .",
    "the strong spin - orbit coupling leads to intersystem crossing from the singlet to triplet excited states and allows for the emission from the otherwise forbidden triplet state ( phosphorescence ) , in addition to emission from the singlet state ( fluorescence ) . as a result",
    ", phosphorescent emitters can have an internal quantum efficiency of @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the possibility to tune the colors of these emitters by modifications in the ligands surrounding the transition - metal center has opened up the possibility to design color displays and efficient white light sources from organic materials ( see ref .   for a review ) .",
    "more recently , the strong intersystem - crossing mechanism that take place in these complexes have been exploited to design organic solar cells ( oscs ) of improved power conversion efficiency  @xcite .",
    "in fact , in organic heterojunctions , sensitizing transition - metal complexes are utilized as promoters in converting photogenerated singlet excitons into long - lived triplet excitons , thereby increasing the probability for an exciton to diffuse to a donor - acceptor interface and dissociate into collectible charges  @xcite . in a recent study",
    "@xcite it was reported that incorporating ir(ppy)@xmath0 ( in concentrations as low as few mass percents ) into electron - donating polymers nearly doubled the photovoltaic efficiency of the considered organic heterojunctions .",
    "these remarkable experimental achievements motivate further theoretical effort to understand the optical properties of transition - metal complexes and ultimately optimize their sensitizing functions taking advantage of their almost unlimited chemical versatility , i.e. , modifying the transition - metal center and attached chromophores . to assist in this endeavor , computational methods of increasing predictive ability are now available . among successful electronic - structure techniques ,",
    "the green s function many - body perturbation theory ( gw ) with bethe - salpeter post - treatment has been accurate in predicting excited - state energies  @xcite , yet requiring considerable effort to achieve full self - consistent convergence . computationally less demanding predictions are based upon time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft ) and linear - response theory  @xcite .",
    "recently , alternative @xmath2-scf  @xcite techniques that consist in evaluating excited - state energies from moderately demanding constrained density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations have also seen a revival of interest  @xcite .    in spite of their limited cost",

    "regard , local and semilocal dft functionals are known to insufficiently localize electronic states .",
    "moreover , conventional tddft calculations rely on the adiabatic approximation whereby the frequency dependence of the tddft kernel is neglected , representing another important source of error in capturing excited states . in practical terms",
    ", tddft approximations do not properly describe charge - transfer states that consist of an electron weakly coupled to a hole  @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we examine the performance of tddft and @xmath2-scf approximations in predicting singlet and triplet excitonic energies in three representative ir complexes , namely , ir(ppy)@xmath0 , firpic and pqir , which emit in the green , the blue and the red  @xcite , respectively .",
    "specifically , we compare tddft with @xmath2-scf that employ hubbard corrections , enabling us to gain needed insight into the effects of electronic localization and charge - transfer for excited states and comment on envisioned functionalization strategies . such insight will be useful to study the influence of ligand modification on singlet and triplet energies with the ultimate goal of guiding experiments in designing more efficient oleds and oscs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we provide some technical details about the computational approach used in this work in section  [ sec : method ] and summarize the methods employed to compute excited - state energies within tddft and @xmath2-scf in section  [ sec : overview ] . in section  [ sec : results ] , we present the main results and provide a detailed discussion on the performance of the methods used and some comments on strategies to tune excited - state energies . finally , we provide some concluding remarks .",

    "the electronic wavefunctions and charge density were expanded up to kinetic energy cutoffs of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively . in performing tddft calculations , the sdd basis set of refs .   was used .",
    "the semilocal pbe  @xcite and hybrid functionals b3lyp  @xcite and m06  @xcite were used in the tddft calculations .    in our plane wave calculations , we employed the hubbard - model corrected dft+u  @xcite method , in order to capture the effects of electronic localization accurately . an improved version of the dft+u formalism , which includes inter - site interactions ( dft+u+v )  @xcite , was also used in order to obtain a better description of interactions between localized electrons on ir @xmath1 states and the surrounding organic ligands .",

    "the theorem of runge and gross  @xcite states that there is a one - to - one correspondence between a time - dependent external potential and the electronic density of a many - body system .",
    "a particular application of the runge - gross theorem was used to compute the energies of excited states of many - body systems , using linear - response functions  @xcite . within this approach ,",
    "the poles of the response function provide the excited - state energies of the system , which can be determined through the solution of the following eigenvalue problem  @xcite : @xmath8 where the solutions @xmath9 represent excited - state energies .",

    "in addition , we adopt the convention that the indices @xmath17 run over occupied states , while @xmath18 run over unoccupied states , and the frequency - dependent vector coefficients @xmath19 are related to the response of the electronic density to a time - dependent perturbation through @xmath20   \\label{xandy}\\ ] ] very often , the frequency dependence of the approximate exchange - correlation functional @xmath15 is ignored ( the adiabatic approximation ) , in obtaining solutions to eq .",

    "the occupied @xmath13 and unoccupied @xmath21 orbitals are spatially separated .",
    "therefore , the matrix @xmath11 , representing the off - diagonal block in eq .",

    "this inaccuracy can be corrected to some extent with the use of nonlocal , hybrid functionals ( such as b3lyp and m06 ) .",
    "the inaccuracy related to rydberg and charge - transfer type excitations stems from the incorrect asymptotic behavior of most approximate exchange - correlation functionals , and can be mitigated by improving their long - range behavior  @xcite .",
    "the modifications to the long - range interactions are generally parameterized and determined empirically .",
    "alternatively , they can be determined from first - principles in a system - dependent fashion  @xcite .",
    "several works also considered the @xmath2-scf method ( discussed in the next subsection ) to be more precise for these types of excitations compared to tddft  @xcite .",
    "a mixture of the two approaches has also been shown to be effective in treating charge - transfer excitations  @xcite .",
    "@xmath2-scf method is based on the construction of excited - state electronic densities , using a non - aufbau scheme for orbital occupations  @xcite . for a system of @xmath22 electrons ,",

    "the spin symmetries of these states can be explicitly determined through the action of the spin operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which yields ( ignoring orbital relaxations ) , @xmath33 the above equations show that @xmath34 are not eigenvectors of the total spin operator , but rather a mixture of singlet and @xmath35 triplet - states with @xmath36 .",
    "although not being eigenfunctions of the actual many - body hamiltonian , such mixed - states appear as variational extrema in @xmath2-scf calculations since approximate exchange - correlation functionals depend on @xmath37 rather than on @xmath31",

    "( [ pur ] ) is provided in the appendix .    a commonly used approach for the calculation of the singlet excited state consists in performing the @xmath2-scf calculation with the spin unpolarized ( nsp ) exchange - correlation functional  @xcite .",

    "we use and compare both the spin - purified approximation ( spa ) and the nsp method for singlet energies .",

    "although it is recognized that the @xmath2-scf approach lacks a formal justification ( at variance with tddft that is based on the runge - gross theorem ) , the @xmath2-scf technique is widely used in the literature and has been quite successful  @xcite .",
    "one of the formal drawbacks of the @xmath2-scf method is that the exchange - correlation functional is the same for both ground and excited states ( i.e. , the functional form is the same with the sole difference that the excited - state density is used in place of the ground - state density ) .",
    "more elaborate schemes with formal justification requires the excited - state calculation to be carried out by different functionals  @xcite , by dft methods with specific many - body wavefunction dependence  @xcite or by construction of ensembles with mixed ground and excited states  @xcite . in either of these cases ,",

    ", one generally relies on statistical arguments extrapolated from the interacting electron gas  @xcite .",
    "the success of @xmath2-scf for lowest energy excitations is plausibly related to the ground - state exchange - correlation functional being sufficiently accurate to describe excited - states in some systems .",
    "typically , conventional approximate exchange - correlation functionals , such as pbe , yield a poor description of localized @xmath1 states for transition metals .",

    "thus , gga+u+v results are within this range of this accuracy .",
    "the excited - state energies of pqir are smaller than those of ir(ppy)@xmath0 and firpic , which accounts for its red phosphorescent emission .",
    "this is due to the stabilization of the lumo level resulting from the larger size of the ( pq ) ligand where it is mostly centered on ( see fig .  [",

    "in fact the ( pq ) ligand has an additional benzene ring compared to ir(ppy)@xmath0 .",
    "a larger ligand structure can be expected to lower the electron - electron interactions and reduce the electronic kinetic energy through a more pronounced delocalization , hence the stabilization of the electronic states it hosts ( the lumo level in this case )  @xcite .",
    "as discussed briefly in subsection  [ subsec : tddft ] , tddft yields inaccurate energies for charge - transfer excitations , specifically if used with local and semilocal functionals , like gga(pbe ) . as we have shown in figs .",

    "indeed , the fact that @xmath2-scf could perform better than tddft for charge - transfer and rydberg excitations is already known from the literature  @xcite .",
    "tddft relies on ks energies determined from the ground - state configuration , and in the case of charge - transfer excitations , the effect of unoccupied orbitals are not accurately taken into account by semilocal functionals since the off - diagonal block matrices ( @xmath11 ) nearly vanishes in eq .",
    "( [ casida - eqn ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the exchange - correlation potential decays exponentially with distance @xmath53 , rather than as @xmath54 .",
    "instead , @xmath2-scf takes into account the orbital relaxation of ground - state ks states , since those are reconstructed at each iteration from an excited - state density [ eq . ( [ rho - ex ] ) ] . if expanded using the basis of unrelaxed orbitals , the relaxed orbitals include components from the unoccupied manifolds that are not properly taken into account by tddft used with ( semi)local functionals . as a result , the effect of the unoccupied manifold ( with respect to ground - state ks orbitals ) is partially included in @xmath2-scf .",
    "along the same lines , ref .   has shown that the long - range behavior of the @xmath2-scf energies can be more accurate than tddft . comparing tables  [ tab : tddft ] ,  [ tab : tddft-2 ] ,  [ tab : tddft-3 ] with tables  [ tab : d - scf ] ,  [ tab : d - scf-2 ] ,  [ tab : d - scf-3 ] one can observe that hybrid functionals within tddft performs similarly to @xmath2-scf calculations with hubbard corrections .",
    "this shows that both methods can be used interchangeably .",
    "in explicit terms , one can use @xmath2-scf with hybrid functionals or tddft with hubbard u and v corrections , where the latter approach would allow for significantly less computational effort for large systems than hybrid functionals .",
    "one other notable advantage of the hubbard corrected functionals is that the @xmath6 and @xmath7 parameters directly control the amount of electronic localization on the ir atom and the hybridization between ir and the surrounding ligands",
    ". this knowledge could provide a functionalization strategy for tuning the excited - state energy levels , as discussed briefly in the next subsection .      in order to investigate the effects of the hubbard corrections",
    "more systematically , we provide a simple model of the system , based on two atomic states , one centered on the metal and the other centered on the ligand , as shown schematically in fig .

    "we found that the spa approach ( based on the construction of a state with mixed spin symmetry ) clearly underestimates the experimental singlet energies .",
    "instead , the nsp calculation yields much more accurate results . while the failure of the spin purification formula can be understood from the inadequacies of the conventional exchange - correlation functionals , the remarkable success of the nsp approach in capturing the singlet remains a relevant open question .",
    "the present work can be considered as the starting point of two main research directions involving methodological developments on one side and the design and optimization of better molecular complexes , on the other . from a methodological point of view",
    "this study highlights the necessity to improve functionals that can distinguish between different @xmath91 configurations ( with the inclusion of spin - orbit interactions ) . on the application side",
    "this work establishes dft+u+v as a valid computational tool ( thanks to its ability to capture the charge - transfer character of excited states ) to efficiently screen useful modification to the ligand structure of the considered molecules that could improve their performance .",
    "furthermore , the dependence of the energy splittings on the values of u and , more importantly , of v , suggests that the choice of the chemical species directly bonded with the ir center and of the structure of the ligands in its coordination shell may represent another valuable route to functionalization that can be explored in addition to the modification of their most external part .",

    "first , the assumption in eq .",
    "( [ et ] ) is not justified .",
    "approximate ground - state exchange - correlation functionals can distinguish between states with different @xmath37 , but not with different @xmath109 , as discussed previously .",

    "thus , an actual ensemble representation of the singlet and @xmath35 triplet - states should contain contribution from such an infinite expansion ( e.g. on unrelaxed ks orbitals ) .",
    "namely , the ensembles must include a linear combination of many excited - state determinants with orbitals @xmath21 occupied where @xmath111 .",
    "such an approach is not viable , since constructing a functional that depends on the weights of each excited slater determinant is not easy . at this point",
    "we would like to stress that ensemble dft of refs .  , does not suffer from such problems , provided that an ensemble dependent exchange - correlation functional exists . in this case",
    ", the energy of each state in the ensemble is uniquely determined by the hohenberg - kohn theorem for ensembles  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : nsp ] .",
    "it is well - known that the single particle density of a transition state  @xcite is equivalent to an ensemble density  @xcite .",

    "( [ nd ] ) , i.e. , the densities of the @xmath35 triplet and singlet states , when orbital relaxation effects are ignored .",
    "since @xmath116 already provides a direct calculation of an ensemble density , unlike the spin - purification formula which relies on a spurious mixed - state @xmath34 , it can be expected that @xmath116 could provide more accurate results .",
    "however , @xmath116 could in principle be a linear combination of other types of excited single determinant states .",
    "for instance , consider a doubly excited state @xmath117 , which is schematically represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : phist ] .",
    "the single - particle density @xmath116 can be obtained from the following ensemble density matrix @xmath118 more generally , @xmath116 can be obtained from an ensemble of the form @xmath119 where @xmath120 .",
    "the reason why @xmath116 results in better singlet energies could be related to the fact that it corresponds to an ensemble eq .",
    "( [ dst2 ] ) , rather than a single determinant description of mixed spin states .",
    "moreover , it is the only variational minimum that one can obtain using approximate ground - state exchange - correlation functionals which has this property .",
    "due to the variational principle , one could expect that contributions from @xmath117 to be suppressed , since it is not the lowest energy configuration with vanishing spin polarization . however , it is not possible to have control over the ensemble weights appearing in eq .",
    "( [ dst2 ] ) with approximate ground - state exchange - correlation functionals .",
    "indeed , hints of this problem can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : d_vs_u ] where the singlet energy was found to increase with @xmath76 almost linearly .",
    "one expects that larger @xmath76 to destabilize the homo level , leading to a decreasing singlet energy . due to the same reason ,",
    "the ground - state energy should increase with @xmath76 .",
    "thus , an increasing singlet energy in fig .",
    "[ fig : d_vs_u ] is an indication that the nsp state contains ground - state contributions .",
    "the arbitrariness in the ensembles that represent @xmath116 , limits the understanding of the nsp @xmath2-scf calculation .",
    "therefore , the use of @xmath116 is only partially justified , and mostly motivated by its empirical success presented in section  [ sec : results ] and previous studies in the literature  @xcite ."
