    "it is deeply recognized that the long - ranged coulomb interaction between ions gives rise to the viscosity enhancement of electrolyte solutions  @xcite .",
    "when a velocity gradient in the solution will deform an ionic atmosphere ( a cloud of couterions around an ion ) , which would otherwise possesses a spherical symmetry , electrostatic forces as well as thermal motion tend to restore the atmosphere to its original form . because of a finite relaxation time of the ionic atmosphere , these two effects can be balanced in a stationary state .",
    "this effect is closely related to the relaxation effect in conductance , and also it is sometimes called the `` electroviscous '' effect by analogy with the electroviscous effects found in charged colloidal suspensions  @xcite . in the case of very low concentration , such an ionic effect is proportional to the square root of the concentration , as was found many years ago by falkenhagen  @xcite and onsager and fuoss  @xcite theoretically , and by jones and dole experimentally  @xcite .    the concentration dependence of the transport properties ( such as the conductivity and the viscosity ) of electrolyte and polyelectrolyte solutions still offer significant challenges .",

    "although the present work is limited to the specific simple system and thus might be less noticeable in the practical point of view , we expect that this work may prompt further studies towards better understandings of rheological properties in more important systems such as concentrated electrolyte solutions , polyelectrolyte solutions  @xcite and charged colloidal suspensions  @xcite under shear .",
