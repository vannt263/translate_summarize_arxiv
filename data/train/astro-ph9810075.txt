    "the recent super kamiokande ( superk ) data on atmospheric neutrinos show strong evidence for neutrino oscillation in a channel which involves muon neutrinos and another neutrino species , and with vacuum mass - squared difference @xmath13 ev@xmath14 ev@xmath8 and vacuum mixing angle satisfying @xmath15@xcite .",
    "measurements of the muon - like events and limits on the electron - like events preclude mixing between @xmath16 and @xmath17 as a significant channel for @xmath16 reduction@xcite .",
    "a @xmath18 mixing with these parameters would also yield a uniform suppression of the solar neutrino flux by roughly a factor @xmath19 across the entire solar neutrino energy spectrum .",
    "however , such an energy independent suppression contradicts what is implied from the combined solar neutrino data @xcite .",
    "this leaves two maximal or near maximal vacuum neutrino oscillation channels as possible avenues for solution : mixing ; or mixing , where @xmath5 is a sterile neutrino ( e.g. , a singlet under the su(3)@xmath20 su(2)@xmath20 u(1 ) gauge symmetry of the standard model ) .",
    "however , it has been pointed out by many groups that   mixing with the aforementioned parameters would violate the constraints from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) if all three active neutrinos are light compared to 1 mev .",
    "this violation results from @xmath0 mixing essentially bringing an extra @xmath5 into chemical equilibrium with the three known species at the bbn epoch . in turn , these extra degrees of freedom imply a larger expansion rate and so would yield a primordial @xmath21he abundance that is too high to accommodate observationally - determined abundance bounds @xcite .",
    "there has been some confusion on this result lately due to a larger systematic uncertainty in the measured primordial @xmath21he abundance as argued by some groups , and due to recent measurements of the primordial deuterium abundance .",
    "furthermore , the bbn constraint has been obtained by assuming a negligible lepton number asymmetry ( @xmath22 ) , which has been shown to be an invalid assumption under circumstances where the lepton asymmetries in the neutrino sector can be amplified by active - sterile neutrino transformations@xcite .",
    "it has been argued that a @xmath9 mixing with a lighter sterile @xmath4 may amplify an initially negligible lepton asymmetry to a large level that either is sufficient to suppress a subsequent @xmath0 mixing @xcite , or can be partly converted to a positive chemical potential in the @xmath23 sector to lower the effective @xmath24@xcite .",
    "both may conceivably lead to an evasion of the bbn bound on the @xmath0 mixing parameters .",
    "it is traditional in bbn studies to parametrize both the @xmath21he yield and the expansion rate of the universe at the bbn epoch in terms of an effective number of relativistic neutrino flavors , @xmath24 . in the context of neutrino oscillation discussions",
