    "the thought experiment of maxwell s demon @xcite was to challenge the second law of the thermodynamics , which states that the entropy can never decrease as time evolves .",
    "the szilard engine @xcite , as a working example , provides us control handles to realize this daring dream in a quantitative and precise way .",
    "the simplest model of classical szilard engine ( csze ) consists of a frictionless movable wall , empty box in which a single gas molecule resides , and a weight to extract the work .",
    "the szilard engine operates in a mostly isolated environment with four main phases : first inserting the wall to divide the box into two equal parts , then the particle s location is measured to determine which side to hang the weight .",
    "the isothermal expansion of gas lifts the weight while in contact with a thermal bath . at last removing the wall to complete a cycle of the szilard engine .",
    "the engine is running based on the information from position measurement of the gas particle .",
    "if we carefully insert and remove the wall in steady speed and exclude the work done by the demon in order to measure and position , the work done by the engine is simply due to the expanding phase , that is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the temperature of thermal bath .",
    "in contrast ,",
    "the quantum szilard engine ( qsze ) , where the box is regarded as the infinite potential well , does work in all three phases : insertion , expansion and removing@xcite . for a single particle",
    ", there appears no difference on the total work from the classical result .",
    "the quantum effect comes into play for more than one particle . in particular",
    ", the total work done by a two - particle qsze can be expressed as @xmath2 where at low temperature , @xmath3 approaches @xmath4 for two identical bosons , but @xmath5 for fermions .",
    "both approach classical work ( @xmath6 ) as @xmath7 .",
    "on the other hand , classical thermodynamics is about to break down for a runaway temperature as the schwarzschild black hole evaporates via the hawking radiation , that is @xmath8 and a uv complete theory of quantum gravity is expected to emerge at the planck scale or string scale @xcite .",
    "however , a convincing theory with supporting evidences from observation or experiments is unavailable at the moment or at least difficult .",
    "an economic and effective way to generate a new scale of the order of planck length is via the generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) satisfying the commutative relation @xcite : @xmath9=i\\hbar(1+\\alpha \\hat{p}^{2 } ) % 6 \\label{eqn_commutative}\\ ] ] application of this modification to the black hole thermodynamics implies a possible existence of remnants , which in terms set up a scale for maximum temperature in our universe @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to investigate its application to other thermodynamic systems . in particular , it is unclear if the szilard engine does work differently under the effect of gup .",
    "will the modification of gup cause any form of violation of the second law ? does the gup have same or different effect on bosons and fermions ? in this letter we will try to find answers for those questions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we review the gup - motivated ideal gas law in two spatial dimensions and derive the correction to the work done by a csze in the section ii .",
    "we found the engine does less work due to the gup effect . in the section iii",
    ", we discuss the work done by the qsze for identical bosons and fermions .",
    "we discovered that their statistical behaviors will be altered and quantum aspects can already been spotted at slightly higher temperature .",
    "for simplicity , we will consider the csze made of a two - dimensional box filled with ideal gas .",
    "the commutative relation ( [ eqn_commutative ] ) implies the following uncertainty principle :    @xmath10 % 7\\ ] ]    or equivalently a suppression at high momentum in the phase space    @xmath11    incorporating the gup effect into the kinetic theory of non - relativistic gas respecting the maxwell - boltzmann statistics , the differential of number density @xmath12 reads ,    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the mass of gas molecule .",
    "this leads to the modified ideal gas law up to @xmath15 correction :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 in the nature unit @xmath18 .",

    "now we consider the configuration as shown in the figure [ 2d - cse model ] , where there are @xmath21 gas molecules at the left compartment and @xmath22 particles at the right . during the isothermal expansion phase ,",
    "the wall starts at the middle of box and moves toward the right or left upon the distribution @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "the expectation value of work done by the csze is calculated in the appendix and has the following form @xcite :    @xmath25}.\\ ] ]     for different @xmath26 .",

    "it shows that the gup effect reduces the work done by csze . with same amount of volume change ,",

    "now we are ready to investigate the gup effect on the second law . without loss of generality",
    ", we can consider a single gas molecule in the 2d box .",
    "the work done by the csze during the isothermal expansion at temperature @xmath1 is given by    @xmath37    where we have considered the minimal length scale @xmath38 under which the compression is impossible . using ( [ eqn_ideal_gas_law ] )",
