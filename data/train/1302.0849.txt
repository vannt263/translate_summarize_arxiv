    "these pieces of evidence firmly pin down the redshifts of the qsos to @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 for a ,  b and  c respectively , where uncertainties are given by the positional accuracy of the  line centroids .",
    "we gathered nir broad band images of the  field using omega2000 @xcite at the 3.5 m telescope in calar alto ( spain ) .",

    "we compute the astrometric solution using the ` astrometry.net ` software @xcite .",
    "photometric calibration is achieved by comparing the photometry of field stars observed in our images with the fluxes reported in the sdss ( z  band ) and 2mass ( j and h  band ) catalogues , using the following filter transformations : @xmath41 equations [ eq_z][eq_h ] are derived by computing the spectral magnitudes of template o to m  type stars .",

    "our colour cuts are a simplified version of those adopted by @xcite on the sdss photometric database .",

    "in this section we discuss the possible scenarios for this peculiar system .       and filter  corrections .",
    "we assume that the potential well of the lensing galaxy is well described by a sis model with @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the stellar velocity dispersion as set by the faber - jackson relation ( see text for details ) . in the lensing scenario ,",
    "a galaxy of z@xmath5619.6 would be required in order to justify the observed separation between  and  c. thanks to the depth of our observations ( z@xmath57 ) , we can rule out the strong  lensing scenario for these two sources . ]    to test the lens hypothesis for  we consider two different configurations : in case ( i )  and  are images of the same , gravitationally lensed qso while  is a different qso at similar redshift . in case ( ii ) , also  is an image of the same qso .",
    "we note that small differences are reported in the colours and in the spectra of the three qsos ( e.g. , the   lines peak at slightly different redshifts ) .",
    "this already disfavours the lensing scenario . however , due to the limited signal  to  noise ratio of the available spectra",
    ", we will focus our analysis mostly on the images .    in case ( i )",
    "we model the potential well of the lensing object with a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) .",

    "the minimum value of @xmath58 allowed in this system corresponds to half of the separation in the sky between  and c , i.e. , @xmath64 .",
    "this implies that , for a given redshift of the lens , we can infer a lower limit for @xmath60 . if we adopt the working assumption that @xmath54 ( the velocity dispersion of stars in the galaxy ) , we can use the faber ",

    "for instance , we consider the case that in our field was present xmmu  j100750.5 + 125818 : a galaxy cluster located at redshift @xmath85 with a line  of  sight velocity dispersion of @xmath86  @xcite .",
    "if the cluster was centred on in the first @xmath83 there should be at least 10 galaxies in excess to the background .",
    "this is in contrast to what observed in the z  band where we detect only 12 galaxies instead of 22 .",
    "we note that this estimate is conservative since we considered as reference only the ( few ) spectroscopically confirmed cluster members of xmmu  j100750.5 + 125818 , while the cluster should be more populated .    from the analysis of photometric data ,",

    "<S> the velocity differences among the three objects ( as measured through the broad  emission line ) are  @xmath2 , suggesting that the quasars belong to the same physical structure . broad band nir images of the field do not reveal evidence of galaxies or galaxy clusters that could act as a gravitational lens , ruling out the possibility that two or all the three quasars are multiple images of a single , strongly lensed source .  is the second triplet of quasars known up to date . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that these systems are extremely rare in terms of simple accidental superposition . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of strong galaxy overdensity suggests that this peculiar system is harboured in the seeds of a yet  to  be  formed massive structure . </S>",
