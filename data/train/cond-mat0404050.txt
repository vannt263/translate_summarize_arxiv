    "although the two - dimensional ising model was solved exactly by onsager in 1944 and much work has been done in this field over the last decades , some questions still remain open .",
    "one is the dynamical critical behaviour .",
    "when we take a lattice with initially all spins up , right at the curie point the magnetization @xmath6 decays with time as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the exponent for the spontaneous magnetization and @xmath9 is the exponent for the correlation length ; both are known exactly .",
    "two main suggestions have been made for the value of @xmath3 in glauber kinetics : one is @xmath5 asymptotically , with simple power law behaviour ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the other is @xmath10 with logarithmic corrections to the power law behaviour .",
    "the latter was suggested by domany @xcite and later by swendsen @xcite .",
    "lots of work has been done in order to rule out one of these assumptions ( e.  g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but with no final result .",
    "we want to test these suggestions using new numercial data obtained by using the new supercomputer jump at the research center jlich .",
    "we compare these with older data .",
    "data was generated by initializing a lattice with all spins up and then doing a monte carlo simulation of the ising model with glauber kinetics . to obtain higher speed , multi spin coding and parallelization ( via mpi ) were used .",
    "speed on one @xmath11 ghz power4 + processor was roughly 160 million sites per second .",
    "up to 512 processors were used in parallel for the largest simulations .",
    "although the new supercomputer jump is rather large , there are some restrictions on the size of lattices that can be simulated . we have chosen @xmath2 and @xmath0 ( the old world record for the two - dimensional ising model was @xmath12 @xcite , @xcite ) , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "thus finite size effects should be negligibly small .",
    "several independent runs were done for @xmath2 for averaging , 50 runs each for the random number generators @xmath13 ( called lcg(@xmath14 ) ) and the 64-bit implementation of ziff s four - tap generator r(471,1586,6988,9689 ) @xcite . for @xmath2",
    "the simulations were done up to 6000 timesteps ( full sweeps through the lattice ) . for the larger lattices , only considerably smaller times were possible , due to restrictions in computing time . for investigating finite - size effects , lattices with @xmath15",
    "were simulated with lcg(@xmath16 ) , again averaging over 50 runs .",
    "the effective exponent @xmath3 can be determined from the @xmath17 data by numercial differentiation : @xmath18 .",
    "even when averaging @xmath17 over several independent runs , fluctuations are visible when calculating the effective @xmath19 .",
    "thus each point in figs .",
    "[ data][fin_size ] represents many @xmath19 ; these points were generated by dividing the data for @xmath20 into several intervals and then doing a least squares fit in each .",
    "each point is the central point of the fit in the interval .",
    "the errorbars for @xmath3 ( not shown in the plots for better legibility ) are of the order of the symbol size for short times and grow to up to @xmath21 for long times . the new data , especially for the large systems , allows for a better fit of the swendsen suggestion .",
    "the new fitted curve has a maximum at about @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the last point for @xmath2 , corresponding to the interval @xmath24 , is subject to strong fluctuations and thus doubtful .",
    "unfortunately , this is the most interesting data point .",
    "nevertheless , a trend is visible : for larger times , the critical exponent seems to go up , not down , thus being in contradiction to the domany - swendsen suggestion .",
    "this could also be due to finite - size effects : for @xmath15 , the effect of increasing @xmath3 seems to be stronger ( cf .",
    "[ fin_size ] ) , but more simulations would be needed for confirmation .",
    "although it is possible to argue that the numerical data for very long times is doubtful , as the influence of fluctuations on the value of @xmath3 increases , the current precision data seems bad for the domany - swendsen assumption . it would be possible to modify the fit to the data , but the trend for long times rather contradicts the value of @xmath4 .    nevertheless , there is still work to do : the influence of various random number generators is important , in order to find one which allows precise data , but is still fast enough for large - scale simulations : for @xmath2 , averaged over 50 runs , ziff s four - tap generator produces results which differ systematically from other generators and system sizes .",
    "this is not the case for a single run with @xmath0 and four - tap generator .",
    "data for @xmath15 , averaged over 25 runs , showed the same behavior as for @xmath2 . for these lattice sizes , r(471,1586,6988,9689 )",
    "seems not to be suited well .",
    "furthermore , the influence of finite - size effects for long times should be investigated in more detail , and the effects of fluctuations in the magnetization in general .",
    "i would like to thank d.  stauffer for fruitful discussions and r.  h.  swendsen for comments on a preliminary version of this paper .",
    "i would also like to thank the research center jlich for computing time on their new supercomputer jump . as a sidenote : the ising program used for this paper was written as a simple test for the shmem - library porting tool in the first place .",
    "thus i would like to thank david klepacki of ibm for help with the turboshmem library , although the program now no longer uses it , but instead straight mpi .      c.  kalle , _ j.  phys .",
