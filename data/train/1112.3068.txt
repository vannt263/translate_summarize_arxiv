    "recently , intriguing hints of the standard model ( sm)-like higgs boson have been reported by the lhc .",
    "the atlas collaboration has presented results in the diphoton  @xcite and @xmath3  @xcite channels , showing a combined @xmath4 excess at @xmath5 gev .",
    "the cms collaboration has also presented results with a weaker @xmath6 excess in the @xmath7 channel at @xmath8 gev  @xcite and two events in the @xmath9 channel near the same mass  @xcite .",
    "it is too early to say whether these preliminary results will grow in significance to become a higgs discovery , but it is not too early to consider some of the consequences if they do .",
    "the potential discovery of a light higgs renews the urgency of the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "supersymmetry remains the best - motivated solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "although it has not yet been found at the lhc , considerable discovery potential still remains in the parameter space relevant for naturalness  @xcite .",
    "however , a 125 gev higgs places stringent constraints on supersymmetry , especially in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . in this paper",
    "we will examine these constraints in detail and use this to study the implications for low - scale susy breaking .",
    "in the mssm , for values of the @xmath10-odd higgs mass @xmath11 gev , there exists a light @xmath10-even higgs state in the spectrum with sm - like couplings to the electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "the sm - higgs mass and properties are dominantly controlled by just a few weak - scale mssm parameters : at tree level , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , joined at higher order by the stop masses @xmath14 and the stop mixing parameter @xmath15 . at tree - level , the higgs mass is bounded above by @xmath16 .",
    "one - loop corrections from stops are responsible for lifting this bound to @xmath17 gev  @xcite , for a general review , see  @xcite",
    ". other parameters of the mssm contribute radiative corrections to the higgs mass , but in general are highly subdominant to the stop sector .",
    "even with large loop effects , it is noteworthy that 125 gev is a relatively large higgs mass for the mssm  this fact allows us to constrain the stop masses and mixing .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus on stop masses @xmath18 tev which includes the collider relevant region .",
    "( we briefly consider heavier stops in the appendix . ) here fixed - order higgs spectrum calculators such as feynhiggs  @xcite , which implements a broad set of one and two - loop corrections to the physical higgs mass , should be fairly accurate . imposing an upper bound on the stop masses implies stringent bounds on @xmath13 and @xmath19 , and in particular requires large mixings among the stops .    for @xmath20 gev",
    ", the sm - like higgs has an enhanced coupling to the down - type fermions , leading to an increase in the @xmath21 partial width and suppressing the branching fractions into the main low - mass lhc search modes , @xmath22  @xcite . since the lhc sees a rate consistent with sm expectations ( albeit with a sizeable error bar ) , in this work we take @xmath23 tev , where all the higgs couplings are sm - like .",
    "this limit also avoids constraints from direct searches for @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath13 we will set a benchmark value of 30 and consider a range of values in some cases .",
    "for @xmath18 tev , a higgs mass of @xmath25 gev places strong constraints on @xmath13 and the stop parameters .",
    "although we will use feynhiggs for all the plots in this section , it is useful to keep in mind the approximate one - loop formula for the higgs mass , @xmath26 as it captures many of the qualitative features that we will see .",
    "we have characterized the scale of superpartner masses with @xmath27 .",
    "first , we see that decreasing @xmath13 always decreases the higgs mass , independent of all the other parameters ( keeping in mind that @xmath28 for perturbativity ) .",
    "so we expect to find a lower bound on @xmath13 coming from the higgs mass .",
    "second , we see that the higgs mass depends on @xmath29 as a quartic polynomial , and in general it has two peaks at @xmath30 , the  maximal mixing scenario \" @xcite .",
    "so we expect that @xmath31 gev intersects this quartic in up to four places , leading to up to four preferred values for @xmath29 .",
    "finally , we see that for fixed @xmath29 , the higgs mass only increases logarithmically with @xmath32 itself .",
    "so we expect a mild lower bound on @xmath32 from @xmath31 gev .    now let s demonstrate these general points with detailed calculations using feynhiggs . shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tanbeta ] are contours of constant higgs mass in the @xmath13 , @xmath33 plane , for @xmath34 tev ( where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the soft masses of the third - generation left - handed quark and right - handed up - type quark scalar fields ) .",
    "the shaded band corresponds to @xmath37 gev , and the dashed lines indicate the same range of higgs masses but with @xmath38 gev .",
    "( the central value in all our plots will always be @xmath31 gev at @xmath39 gev . ) from all this , we conclude that to be able to get @xmath25 gev , we must have @xmath40 so this is an absolute lower bound on @xmath13 just from the higgs mass measurement .",
    "we also find that the higgs mass basically ceases to depend on @xmath13 for @xmath13 beyond @xmath41 .",
    "so for the rest of the paper we will take @xmath42 for simplicity .     in the @xmath13 vs.  @xmath29 plane .",
    "the stops were set at @xmath34 tev , and the result is only weakly dependent on the stop mass up to @xmath43 tev .",
    "the solid curve is @xmath31 gev with @xmath39 gev .",
    "the band around the curve corresponds to @xmath44123 - 127 gev . finally , the dashed lines correspond to varying @xmath45 from 172 - 174 .",

    "[ fig : mhcurves ] are contours of constant @xmath47 vs @xmath32 and @xmath46 .",
    "we see that for large @xmath32 , we want @xmath48 we also see that the smallest the @xmath2-terms and the susy - scale can absolutely be are @xmath49 it is also interesting to examine the limits in the plane of physical stop masses . shown in fig .",

    "no solution to @xmath31 gev was found .",
    "here we see that the @xmath54 can be as light as 200 gev , provided we take @xmath55 to be heavy enough .",
    "we also see that the heavy stop has to be much heavier in general in the @xmath52 case .     in the @xmath56 vs.  @xmath46 plane , with @xmath42 and @xmath57 .",
    "the solid / dashed lines and gray bands are as in fig .",

    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "having understood what @xmath58 gev implies for the weak - scale mssm parameters , we now turn to the implications for the underlying model of susy - breaking and mediation . in rg running down from a high scale , for positive gluino mass @xmath59 , the @xmath2-term @xmath19 decreases .",
    "the gluino mass also drives squark mass - squareds larger at small scales , whereas the @xmath2-term drives them smaller .",
    "the interplay among these effects is illustrated in the running of two sample spectra in figure  [ fig : rgeruns ] .",
    "we see that for negative @xmath19 at the weak - scale , rg running can drive @xmath19 across @xmath60 at some high scale , but for positive @xmath19 at the weak scale , rg running generally drives @xmath19 even higher .",
    "this has important consequences for models of gauge mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) .",
    "( for a review and original references , see @xcite . ) in pure gauge mediation ( as defined e.g.  in @xcite ) , the @xmath2-terms are strictly zero at the messenger scale .",
    "this conclusion remains robust even when a sector is added to generate @xmath61/@xmath62 @xcite . clearly , in models of gmsb with vanishing @xmath2-terms at the messenger scale , to get sufficiently large @xmath2 terms at the weak scale , we must either run for a long time , or have heavy gauginos .",
    "we can quantify this by starting from the ew scale ( @xmath51 , @xmath50 ) points that can produce the required higgs mass with a negative value for @xmath19 , and define a gauge mediation messenger scale by evolving @xmath19 until it vanishes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mmess ] we plot the messenger scales obtained over the @xmath63 plane from this algorithm , performing the evolution with 1-loop @xmath64 functions , decoupling the gluino below @xmath59 , and decoupling the rest of the superpartner spectrum at @xmath32 . due to the logarithmic sensitivity of @xmath19 on the messenger scale , and the polynomial dependence of @xmath47 on @xmath19 ,",
    "the reconstructed messenger scale varies strongly between @xmath65 gev and @xmath66 gev , as shown in the two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : mmess ] .",
    "we see that large gluino masses are required to keep the messenger scale below the gut scale .",
    "notice that we have assumed the running of @xmath19 is dominated by @xmath59 . if the superpartner spectrum had @xmath67 or @xmath68 , this conclusion might be avoided , but this requires unusual hierarchies in the gaugino spectrum .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in gauge mediation , the messenger mass scale is closely related to the lifetime for the decay of the next - to - lightest superpartner ( nlsp ) to the gravitino .",
    "we can quantify this as follows .",
    "achieving superpartners in the tev mass regime requires @xmath69 tev .",
    "a typical lifetime is determined by the coupling to the goldstino , which is @xmath70 suppressed , and hence @xmath71 thus , a 10@xmath72 gev messenger scale corresponds to  collider - size \" decay lengths , and higher messenger scales correspond to  collider - stable \" nlsps .",
    "based on figure  [ fig : mmess ] , we see that achieving the requisite @xmath2-terms in gauge mediation with superpartners of order a tev is only possible in the limit of long - lived or collider - stable nlsps .",
    "prompt decays ( corresponding to much lower messenger scales ) are allowed in gmsb ( with vanishing @xmath2-terms at the messenger scale ) only for extremely heavy gluinos , well above 4 tev . for gmsb models with gluinos of a few tev ,",
    "messenger scales on the order of 10@xmath73 gev can exist , allowing for collider - size but not truly prompt decays .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath74 gev , the nlsp lifetimes become a second or longer , and nlsp decays can play a significant role in post - bbn cosmology  @xcite . additionally , gravitinos can overclose the universe if the reheating scale is too large , although this constraint is milder at large @xmath75  @xcite .",
    "the squark soft masses squared are also strongly influenced by @xmath59 dependence in their @xmath64-functions .",
    "typically they are driven negative at the messenger scale .",
    "while this clearly requires non - minimal gauge mediation , it is not intrinsically problematic for the theory , and can in fact lead to improvements in the fine - tuning problems of the mssm  @xcite .",
    "tachyonic stops at a high scale will lead to charge and color breaking ( ccb ) vacua , but the lifetime of our vacuum is typically long enough that the theory is not excluded  @xcite .",
    "it is also important to make sure that our cosmological history is not affected by the presence of ccb vacua  @xcite .",
    "given that the ccb vacuum , long - lived nlsps , and thermal production of gravitinos can all pose different constraints on the theory , it is possible that reheating in such a scenario is strongly constrained , and this deserves further study .",
    "it is also interesting , given relatively large messenger scales and hence gravitino masses , to consider the possibility of superwimp gravitino dark matter  @xcite .",
    "broadly speaking , the possible supersymmetric interpretations of a 125 gev higgs fall into three classes : large @xmath2-terms , heavy scalars , or modifications of the mssm ( such as extensions of the higgs sector , compositeness , or new gauge groups ) . within the mssm",
    ", we have seen that restricting to light scalars requires an @xmath2-term above 1 tev ; avoiding the conclusion of large @xmath2-terms is only possible by decoupling scalars to at least 5 tev .",
    "thus , a higgs at this mass is in some tension with mssm naturalness .",
    "furthermore , the requirement of large @xmath2-terms is a powerful constraint on models of the supersymmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "most notably , we have seen that there is a severe restriction on the allowed messenger scale in gauge mediation if superpartners are within reach at the lhc .",
    "this can be avoided only by extending the definition of gauge mediation , e.g. to include new higgs - sector couplings to the susy breaking sector .",
    "looking forward , let us briefly comment on the higgs cross section and branching ratio in the sm vs.  the mssm .",
    "the production of the higgs at the lhc through gluon fusion and the higgs decay to two photons are both loop - level processes in the standard model and can be sensitive to the presence of new physics  @xcite . however , as we have shown here , @xmath66 gev generally requires quite heavy stops , and this limits the effect they can have on the cross section and branching ratio .",
    "generally , we find a suppression of @xmath76 of at most 15% through varying @xmath14 and requiring @xmath77 gev .",
    "we find much smaller suppressions of the effective cross sections into @xmath78 and @xmath79 given that they are tree level decays and less sensitive to higher scale physics .",
    "whether these small deviations from the sm could be measured at the lhc is a subject for future study .",
    "certainly we do not expect experimental results along these lines any time soon .",
    "we should also comment on the assumptions that have gone into the conclusions here .",
    "first , we assumed the pure mssm .",
    "this led directly to the large @xmath19 and heavy stop conclusions .",
    "if we relax this assumption ( e.g.  to the nmssm ) , then many of these conclusions could change qualitatively .",
    "second , for gauge mediation we assumed @xmath60 at the messenger scale .",
    "clearly this is not completely set in stone , and it would be interesting to look for models of gmsb ( or more generally flavor - blind models ) with large @xmath19 at the messenger scale",
    ". this may be possible in more extended models , for instance in  @xcite where the higgses mix with doublet messengers .",
    ", with @xmath80 .",
    "the green band is the output of feynhiggs together with its associated uncertainty .",
    "the blue line represents 1-loop renormalization group evolution in the standard model matched to the mssm at @xmath32 .",
    "the blue bands give estimates of errors from varying the top mass between 172 and 174 gev ( darker band ) and the renormalization scale between @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( lighter band).,scaledwidth=38.0% ]    although we have focused on mixed stops which can be light enough to be produced at the lhc , let us briefly consider the case of stops _ without _ mixing . for small @xmath32 , we can compute the higgs mass with feynhiggs . for larger @xmath32",
    ", we use a one - loop rge to evolve the susy quartic down to the electroweak scale , computing the physical higgs mass by including self - energy corrections  @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : highscalemh ] , we plot the resulting value of @xmath47 as a function of @xmath32 , in the case of zero mixing .",
    "we plot the feynhiggs output only up to 3 tev , at which point its uncertainties become large and the rge is more trustworthy .",
    "one can see from the plot that accommodating a 125 gev higgs in the mssm with small @xmath2-terms requires scalar masses in the range of 5 to 10 tev .    a variation on this  heavy stop \" scenario is split supersymmetry  @xcite , in which gauginos and higgsinos have masses well below @xmath32 and influence the running of @xmath83 .",
    "in this case , the running below @xmath32 is modified by the light superpartners , and the preferred scalar mass scale for a 125 gev higgs can be even larger  @xcite .                      h.  e.  haber and r.  hempfling , phys .  rev .",
