    "effective nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions such as the skyrme and skyrme - like interactions play an important role in predicting the properties of finite nuclei  , nuclear matter and neutron stars  @xcite , nucleus - nucleus interaction potential  @xcite and fission barriers  @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the effective interactions are usually constrained by the ground state properties of stable nuclei and the saturation properties of nuclear matter , and thus they are shown to be quite successful for describing nuclear phenomena related to nuclear system not far from the normal nuclear matter density ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) at small isospin - asymmetries . however , as soon as the density deviates from the normal nuclear matter density and the isospin - asymmetry becomes large , the discrepancy among the predictions of the skyrme - hartree - fock ( shf ) approach by adopting different skyrme parameters could be extremely large  @xcite .",
    "as for the isospin dependence of single - particle properties , different skyrme parameters may lead to an opposite isospin splitting of the neutron and proton effective masses in neutron - rich nuclear matter even at densities around @xmath6  @xcite . in order to improve the predictive power of the skyrme interaction at high densities and large isospin asymmetries , some work was done in recent years to constrain the skyrme parameters by fitting the bulk properties of asymmetric nuclear matter obtained by the shf approach to those predicted by the microscopic many - body theories .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite chabanat _",
    "proposed a number of sets of skyrme parameters by reproducing the equation of states ( eoss ) of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter predicted by the microscopic variational approach  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors constructed the lns parameters for the skyrme interaction by fitting to the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter and the neutron / proton effective mass splitting in neutron - rich matter around saturation density obtained within the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) approach extended to include a microscopic three - body force ( tbf )  @xcite .",
    "although these recent parametrizations of skyrme interaction can reproduce fairly well the eoss of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter predicted by microscopic approaches(variational method and bhf approach ) , the deviation from the microscopic results is shown to become significantly large even for symmetric nuclear matter as soon as the eos is decomposed into different spin - isospin channels  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is of interest to investigate the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter and its isospin dependence in various spin - isospin @xmath0 channels within the framework of the microscopic bhf approach for a deeper understanding of the mechanism of the isospin dependence of the nuclear eos and for providing more rigorous and elaborate microscopic constraints for effective nn interactions .    in the present paper",
    ", we shall decompose the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter into various spin - isospin @xmath0 channels by using the bhf approach extended to include a microscopic three - body force .",
    "we shall discuss particularly the isovector part and the isospin dependence of the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter in different spin - isospin @xmath0 channels .",
    "the obtained results are expected to provide some useful information for constraining the spin - isospin properties of effective nn interactions .",

    "we simply give a brief review for completeness .",
    "the starting point of the bhf approach is the reaction @xmath7-matrix , which satisfies the following isospin dependent bethe - goldstone ( bg ) equation , @xmath8 where @xmath9 , denotes the momentum , the @xmath10-component of spin and isospin of a nucleon , respectively .",
    "@xmath11 is the realistic nn interaction , @xmath12 is the starting energy .",
    "the asymmetry parameter is defined as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 denote the total , neutron and proton number densities , respectively . in solving the bg equation for the @xmath7-matrix , the continuous choice  @xcite for the auxiliary potential @xmath16",
    "is adopted since it provides a much faster convergence of the hole - line expansion than the gap choice  @xcite . under the continuous choice ,",
    "the auxiliary potential describes the bhf mean field felt by a nucleon during its propagation in nuclear medium  @xcite .",
    "the bg equation has been solved in the total angular momentum representation  @xcite . by using the standard angular - averaging scheme for the pauli operator and the energy denominator ,",
    "the bg equation can be decoupled into different partial wave @xmath17 channels  @xcite , where @xmath18 denotes the total angular momentum , @xmath19 the total spin and @xmath20 the total isospin of a two - particle state .",
    "for the nn interaction , we adopt the argonne @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) two - body interaction  @xcite plus a microscopic based on the meson - exchange current approach  @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the tbf model have been self - consistently determined so as to reproduce the @xmath22 two - body force by using the one - boson - exchange potential model  @xcite .",
    "the tbf contains the contributions from different intermediate virtual processes such as virtual nucleon - antinucleon pair excitations , and nucleon resonances ( for details , see ref .",
    "the tbf effects on the eos of nuclear matter and its connection to the relativistic effects in the dbhf approach have been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the tbf contribution has been included by reducing the tbf to an equivalently effective two - body interaction via a suitable average with respect to the third - nucleon degrees of freedom according to the standard scheme  @xcite .",
