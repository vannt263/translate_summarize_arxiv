    "<S> nontrivial topology require either a @xmath0-phase difference between the intra - surface pairing states , spin - triplet inter - surface pairing , which is necessarily odd in the surface index , or spin - singlet inter - surface pairing with a sign - changing tunnel coupling , present in many ti thin films . in all cases the topological phase and its kramers pair of majorana edge modes is highly tunable with an applied electric field and varied chemical potential .    topology in condensed matter systems has received a massive amount of interest in recent years . starting with the discovery of topological insulators ( tis ) @xcite , where nontrivial topology of the bulk band structure creates surface states with a dirac - spectrum crossing the bulk band gap , </S>",
    "<S> topology is now also applied widely in the discussion of properties of superconductors and semimetals @xcite . in topological superconductors </S>",
    "<S> the zero - energy surface states are particularly intriguing as they are majorana modes , due to their equal electron and hole characteristics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the non - abelian statistics of majorana zero - modes makes topological superconductors very promising for topological quantum computation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> many topological superconductors explicitly break time - reversal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this is usually achieved by magnetic field or impurities , which together with rashba spin - orbit coupling and superconductivity can give nontrivial topology @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a close alternative is superconducting ti surfaces , where majorana modes appear in vortex cores or at ferromagnetic interfaces , again requiring magnetic fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , time - reversal - invariant superconductors can also be topologically nontrivial , where instead the surface spectrum consists of a kramers pair of helical majorana modes @xcite . despite the doubling of the majorana modes , non - abelian operations , suitable for quantum computation , </S>",
    "<S> have still been demonstrated in these systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since superconductivity is generally very sensitive to magnetic fields , time - reversal - invariant systems have a very natural advantage in terms of stability of the superconducting phase .    </S>",
    "<S> proposals for time - reversal - invariant superconductors have mainly been based on multi - channel systems , since noninteracting single - channel systems with conventional @xmath1-wave superconductivity can not be topological @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , multiband / orbital systems and @xmath2-wave iron - based superconductors have been shown to be able to host a nontrivial phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> double wire systems with rashba spin - orbit coupling have also been studied , where a @xmath0-phase difference of the superconducting order parameter between the two wires @xcite , or a strong inter - wire pairing @xcite have been shown to give nontrivial topology . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath0-phase difference has also been shown to give a nontrivial topology in a simple model for unbiased ti thin films . </S>",
    "<S> similar criteria have also been found in double layer rashba materials with strong interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , all these systems have shown very limited tunability of the topological phase by experimentally controllable parameters , which both limit applications and possibilities to detect nontrivial topological phases .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we study conventional @xmath1-wave superconductivity in realistic models of superconductivity in three - dimensional ( 3d ) ti thin films . for ti films thinner than 6 quintuple layers ( ql ) , </S>",
    "<S> an energy gap opens in the surface states @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however , sufficient doping produces a finite density of states at the fermi level , such that thin films can easily enter a superconducting phase either by proximity to external superconductors @xcite , or possibly by an intrinsic mechanism . to allow for the most general situation we consider both @xmath1-wave intra - surface pairing and inter - surface pairing , since inter - surface pairing is present in proximity - induced superconducting thin films through crossed andreev reflection @xcite and proximity effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show that intra - surface pairing leads to a topologically nontrivial state when there is a @xmath0-phase difference between the two surface pairing terms . </S>",
    "<S> further , spin - triplet inter - surface pairing is odd in surface index and we show therefore also nontrivial . for nontrivial topology with spin - singlet inter - surface pairing , the thin film tunneling needs to change sign with momentum , which is very common in ti thin films . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , in all cases the topological phase is highly tunable with an applied electric field or by varying the chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for direct tuning of time - reversal - invariant topological superconductivity and its associated kramers pair of majorana edge modes in ti thin films .    </S>",

    "<S> this results in the total order parameter in the surface basis being @xmath21 where the intra - surface pairing is necessarily spin - singlet , while inter - surface pairing can be either spin - singlet ( s ) or triplet ( t ) , depending on the parity in surface index being even or odd , respectively . finally , the total bdg hamiltonian of the system , written in nambu space , is @xmath22      for a time - reversal - invariant system we can rotate the bdg hamiltonian in eq .   and write it in the basis @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the original normal - state basis . </S>",

    "<S> the spin - triplet inter - surface pairing is absent in this expression since it is odd under the surface index and thus give a zero contribution in eq .  .      </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the case of zero or negligible inter - surface pairing and focus on only finite intra - surface orders @xmath43 . </S>",
