    "polarization of light is a robust characteristic that can be efficiently manipulated using modest equipment without introducing more than marginal losses .",
    "it is thus not surprising that this is often the variable of choice to encode quantum information , as one can convince oneself by looking at some recent cutting - edge experiments , including quantum key distribution  @xcite , quantum dense coding  @xcite , quantum teleportation  @xcite , rotationally invariant states  @xcite , phase super - resolution  @xcite , and weak measurements  @xcite .    in the discrete - variable regime of single , or few ,",
    "photons , one is mostly interested into two - mode states , which for all practical purposes can be regarded as a spin system  @xcite . as a result , the polarization state can be determined from correlation functions of different orders  @xcite .",
    "given the small dimensionality of the hilbert space involved , the state reconstruction can be readily performed .    in the continuous - variable case ,",
    "polarization properties are exploited for an expedient generation , manipulation , and measurement of nonclassical light .",
    "polarization squeezing  @xcite , which has been observed in numerous experiments  @xcite , is perhaps the most tantalizing illustration .",
    "full stokes polarimetry  @xcite is the method employed by the majority of the practitioners in this area .",
    "however , the reconstruction in this limit is a touchy business and requires special care .",
    "the origin of the problem can be traced back to the fact that the characterization of the polarization state by the whole density operator is superfluous , because it contains much more than polarization information .",
    "this redundancy can easily be handled for low number of photons , but becomes a real hurdle for highly excited states .",
    "an adequate solution has been proposed recently : it suffices with a subset of the density matrix that has been called the `` polarization sector ''  @xcite or the `` polarization density operator ''  @xcite .",
    "its knowledge allows for a complete specification of the state on the poincar sphere ( actually on a set of nested spheres that can be appropriately called the poincar space ) .",
    "the technique was devised by karassiov and coworkers  @xcite and implemented experimentally in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a comprehensive treatment of polarization tomography . as with any reliable quantum tomographical scheme ,",
    "we need to supply three key ingredients  @xcite : the availability of a tomographically complete measurement , a suitable representation of the quantum states , and a robust algorithm for inverting the experimental data . in this respect ,",
    "we use a standard stokes scheme that implements the first ingredient in a very simple way ; for the second , we resort to the well - known su(2 ) wigner distribution  @xcite , and finally , we prove that the inversion of the data in terms of that wigner function is an inverse three - dimensional ( 3d ) radon transform .    to support the experimental feasibility of our scheme , we carry out the full tomography of a bright polarization - squeezed state generated in a kerr medium  @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction is accomplished in three - different ways : by the direct inversion of the radon transform , by a maximum - likelihood estimation and , finally , by a gaussian approximation .",
    "the final results are compared and the sources of uncertainty are analyzed .",
    "a satisfactory description of the polarization structure of quantum fields and the corresponding observables that specify this structure is of paramount importance for our purposes .    we restrict our attention to the case of a monochromatic plane wave ( the formalism can be easily extended to more involved multimode wavefronts  @xcite ) , which we assume to propagate in the @xmath0 direction , so its electric field lies in the @xmath1 plane . under these conditions",
    ", we are dealing with a two - mode field that can be fully characterized by two complex amplitude operators .",
    "they are denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where the subscripts @xmath4 and @xmath5 indicate horizontally and vertically polarized modes , respectively .",

    "one immediately notices that @xmath9 satisfy the commutation relations of the su(2 ) algebra @xmath10 = i \\epsilon_{k \\ell m } \\ ,   { \\hat{j}}_{m }   \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the levi - civita fully antisymmetric tensor .",
    "this noncommutability precludes the simultaneous exact measurement of the physical quantities they represent . among other consequences",
    ", this implies that no field state ( apart from the vacuum ) can have sharp nonfluctuating values of all the operators @xmath12 simultaneously .",
    "this is expressed by the uncertainty relation @xmath13 where the variances are given by @xmath14 . in other words ,",
    "the electric vector of a monochromatic quantum field never traces out a definite ellipse .    in classical optics ,",
    "the total intensity is a well - defined quantity and the poincar sphere appears thus as a smooth surface with radius equal to that intensity . in quantum optics we have @xmath15 and , as fluctuations in the number of photons",
    "are unavoidable ( leaving aside photon - number states ) , we are forced to talk of a three - dimensional poincar space ( with axis @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) that can be envisioned as foliated in a set of nested spheres with radii proportional to the different photon numbers that contribute significantly to the state .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath19 of these two - mode fields has a convenient orthonormal basis in the form of fock states for both polarization modes , namely @xmath20 .",
    "however , since @xmath21 = 0 \\ , , \\ ] ] each subspace with a fixed number of photons @xmath22 must be handled separately .",
    "in other words , in the previous onion - like picture of the poincar space , each shell has to be addressed independently .",
    "this can be emphasized if instead of the fock basis , we employ the relabeling @xmath23 according to ( [ eq : nhmr ] ) , we have that @xmath24 and this basis can be also seen as the common eigenstates of @xmath25 . in this way , for each fixed @xmath26 ( i.e. , fixed number of photons @xmath22 ) , @xmath27 runs from @xmath28 to @xmath26 and these states span a @xmath29-dimensional subspace wherein @xmath12 acts in the usual way ( in units @xmath30 ) @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "it is clear from all this previous discussion that the moments of any energy - preserving observable ( such as @xmath12 ) do not depend on the coherences between different subspaces .",
    "the only accessible information from any state described by the density matrix @xmath33 is thus its polarization sector , which is specified by the block - diagonal form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the reduced density matrix in the @xmath26 subspace .",
    "any @xmath33 and its associated block - diagonal form @xmath36 can not be distinguished in polarization measurements ( and , accordingly , we drop henceforth the subscript pol ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that polarization and intensity are , in principle , independent concepts : in classical optics the form of the ellipse described by the electric field ( polarization ) does not depend on its size ( intensity ) .",
    "the variances of the angular - momentum operators ( [ stokop ] ) are not independent , for they are constrained by @xmath37 it is always possible to find pairs of maximally conjugate operators for this uncertainty relation .",
    "this is equivalent to establishing a basis in which only one of the operators ( [ stokop ] ) has a nonzero expectation value , say and @xmath38 .",
    "the only nontrivial heisenberg inequality reads thus @xmath39 polarization squeezing can then be sensibly defined as  @xcite : @xmath40 the choice of the conjugate operators @xmath41 is by not means unique : there exists an infinite set @xmath42 that are perpendicular to the state classical excitation @xmath43 , for which @xmath44 for all @xmath45 .",
    "all these pairs exist in the @xmath46@xmath47 plane , which is called the `` dark plane '' because it is the plane of zero mean intensity .",
    "we can express a generic @xmath48 as @xmath49 , @xmath45 being an angle defined relative to @xmath50 .",
    "condition ( [ eq : polsq1 ] ) is then equivalent to @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the squeezed parameter and @xmath53 the antisqueezed parameter .    in the experiments presented in this paper , a focal role",
    "will be played by the example in which the horizontal and vertical modes have the same amplitude but are phase shifted by @xmath54 : @xmath55 , @xmath56 being a real number .",
    "this light is circularly polarized and fulfills @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "it is advantageous to work in the circular polarization basis , whose right @xmath59 and left @xmath60 amplitudes are given in terms of the linear ones by @xmath61 in this manner , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the operators in the @xmath16@xmath18 plane correspond to the quadrature operators of the dark left - polarized mode .",
    "in fact , expressing the fluctuations of @xmath12 in terms of the noise of the circularly polarized modes @xmath64 and assuming @xmath65 we find  @xcite @xmath66 \\ , ,     \\label{eq_polsq_darkmode}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 are the rotated quadratures for the @xmath68th amplitude . on the other hand , we have that @xmath69 and the intensity exhibits no dependence on the dark mode . in consequence , the condition ( [ eq : polsq2 ] ) can be recast for this example as @xmath70 that is , polarization squeezing is equivalent to vacuum squeezing in the orthogonal polarization mode .    in the dark - plane measurements",
    ", the beam is divided equally between two photodetectors .",
    "such measurements are then identical to balanced homodyne detection : the classical excitation is a local oscillator for the orthogonally polarized dark mode .",
    "the phase between these modes is varied by rotating the measurement through the dark plane , allowing a full characterization of the noise properties .",
    "this is a unique feature of polarization measurements and has been used in many experiments  @xcite .",
    "the structure discussed so far highlights that su(2 ) is the symmetry group for polarization . to provide an appropriate phase - space description of states , we take advantage of the pioneering work of stratonovich  @xcite and berezin  @xcite , who introduced quasi - probability distribution functions on the sphere satisfying all the proper requirements .",
    "this construction was later generalized by others  @xcite and has proved to be very useful in visualizing properties of spinlike systems  @xcite    to gain physical insights into this approach , let us start by representing the density matrix with respect to the polarization basis . instead of using",
    "directly the states @xmath71 , it is more convenient to write such an expansion as @xmath72 where the irreducible tensor operators @xmath73 are  @xcite @xmath74 with @xmath75 being the clebsch - gordan coefficients that couple a spin @xmath26 and a spin @xmath76 to a total spin @xmath26 .",

    "( i.e. , all the moments of the stokes parameters ) .",
    "one can obtain the marginal of @xmath90 once summed over all the values of @xmath26 @xmath91 where the factor has been introduced to ensure the proper normalization .    in the above - mentioned example of a strong circularly polarized state",
    ", we can consider that the sphere can locally be replaced by its tangent plane since @xmath92 .",
    "using simple geometrical relations between the coordinates @xmath93 and the cartesian coordinates @xmath94 in that tangent plane , we get @xmath95 which confirms that the dark plane is equivalent to the standard phase space for continuous variables .    in the limit of large photon numbers the representation ( [ eq : wignsu2 ] ) is not very useful . in such a case ,",
    "a remarkably effective approximation is given by@xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the unitary vector in the direction @xmath98 .",
    "a general polarimetric apparatus consists of a half - wave plate , with axis at angle @xmath56 , followed by a quarter - wave plate at angle @xmath99 . for fixed values of the angles @xmath100 of the wave plates ,",
    "the selected direction in the stokes space is @xmath101 the polarization transformations performed by the wave plates can be represented by @xmath102 , which generates rotations about the direction of propagation , and @xmath103 , which generates phase shifts between the modes .",
    "their joint action is given by the operator @xmath104 which describes displacements over the sphere .",
    "after that , a polarizing beam splitter projects onto the basis @xmath105 .    in physical terms , the wave plates transform the input polarization allowing the measurement of different stokes parameters by the projection onto the basis @xmath105 . this can be modeled by @xmath106 so that @xmath107 $ ] is the probability of detecting @xmath108 photons in the horizontal mode and simultaneously @xmath109 photons in the vertical one .",

    "the reconstruction in this limit turns out to be equivalent to an inverse radon transform of the measured tomograms .",
    "to validate our approach , we perform the tomography of a polarization squeezed state , generated in a polarization - maintaining optical fibre through the nonlinear kerr effect  @xcite .",
    "the setup is shown in figure  1 .",
    "the light source is a shot - noise limited origami laser from onefive gmbh emitting 220  fs pulses at a repetition rate of 80  mhz and centered at 1560  nm .",
    "the light is fed into a 13  m - long polarization - maintaining birefringent fibre ( 3 m fs - pm-7811 , 5.6 @xmath128 m mode - field diameter ) so that quadrature squeezed states are simultaneously and independently generated in both polarization modes .",
    "the strong birefringence of the fibre ( beat length 1.67  mm ) causes a delay between the emerging quadrature - squeezed pulses .",
    "we precompensate for this delay in an unbalanced michelson - like interferometer placed before the fibre . a small part ( 0.1  % ) of the fibre output serves as the input to a control loop to maintain the relative phase between the exiting pulses locked to @xmath129 , so the light is circularly polarized .",
    "the quantum state is detected with a stokes measurement , as sketched in the previous section .",
    "the two detectors ( ingaas pin photodiodes , custom - made by laser components gmbh with 98  % quantum efficiency at dc ) are balanced and have a sub - shot noise resolution at a frequency range between 5  mhz and 30  mhz .",
    "each detector has two separate outputs : dc , providing the average values of the photocurrents , and ac , providing the photocurrents amplified in radio - frequency ( rf ) spectral range .",
    "the rf currents of the photodetectors are mixed with an electronic local oscillator at 12 mhz , amplified ( femto dhpva-100 ) , and digitized by an analog / digital exit converter ( gage compuscope 1610 ) at 10 megasamples per second with a 16-bit resolution and 10 times oversampling .",
    "the measurements are performed at a pulse energy of 93  pj . in the dark plane a total squeezing of about 3.8  db is observed . in the orthogonal quadrature ,",
    "the noise was enhanced by several tens of db due to guided acoustic wave brillouin scattering ( gawbs )  @xcite . in the direction of the classical excitation",
    ", the state is expected to be shot - noise limited , since the kerr effect only influences the phase and does not contribute to the photon number .    to perform the reconstruction ,",
    "histograms of the stokes variables are recorded for different angles @xmath93 .",
    "this is done by rotating the wave plates with motorized stages ( owis dmt 40-d20-hsm ) and scanning one eighth of the poincar sphere in 8100 steps , a measurement that took over eight hours .",
    "the unmeasured octants were deduced from symmetry . for each setting of the wave plates , the photocurrent noise of both detectors",
    "was simultaneously sampled @xmath130 times .",
    "noise statistics of the detectors difference current were acquired in histograms with 751 bins . additionally , the optical intensity was recorded .    in figure",
    "2 we show typical histograms at different angles on the poincar sphere . as the widths largely vary from squeezing to antisqueezing ranges , there are two plots in which the amplitude scale differs in more than one order of magnitude .",
    "the histograms labeled 1 , 2 and 3 are measured in the dark plane .",
    "tomogram 1 denotes the angle of maximum squeezing , while 3 corresponds to the antisqueezing .",
    "tomogram 4 is at the classical mean value , where the measured noise is almost shot - noise limited . due to the high number of samples , the measured histograms are smooth and , at the same time",
    ", the number of bins makes it possible to resolve the large dynamical range of amplitudes , so no data interpolation was needed .",
    "we also plot histograms showing the electronic noise and the shot noise .        for all these histograms",
    "we have performed a gaussianity check , using the kolmogorov - smirnov and the @xmath131 tests , as well as the kullback - leibler divergence@xcite .",
    "we can conclude that all the histogramas are gaussian within confidence levels ranging from 95  % to 98 % .      as clearly expressed in ( [ 3drt ] ) , for high photon numbers the tomography turns out to be equivalent to an inverse radon transform of the measured histograms . in practice ,",
    "this one - step 3d reconstruction is very demanding in computational resources .",
    "therefore , we divide the process into two steps : first , a set of 2d projections is reconstructed from the recorded histograms ; subsequently , the wigner function is slice - wise generated from those projections ( to which we apply a hamming filter to smooth the noise ) .",
    "the symmetry of the state is used as a prior information to reduce the range of measured angles to an octant .",
    "this minimizes the systematic errors stemming from imperfections of the polarization optics .",
    "( from the maximum ) of the wigner function @xmath132 for the polarization squeezed state generated in the setup of figure  1 .",
    "( left ) sections of the wigner function through the three coordinate planes . in blue",
    "we show the isotropic section for a coherent state , which we use as unit for all the plots . ]    in figure  3 ( right panel ) we show the final result of the inverse radon transform for our polarization squeezed state . more concretely",
    ", we plot an isocontour surface of @xmath133 constant ( with the constant being @xmath134 from the maximum ) in the poincar space having @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 as orthogonal axes .",
    "as coordinate units we use the shot noise set by a coherent state .",
    "the ellipsoidal shape of the state is clearly visible .",
    "the center of the ellipsoid is far away from the origin , since we have @xmath138 photons per measurement time ( using 1.9  mhz resolution bandwidth ) .",
    "the antisqueezed direction of the ellipsoid is dominated by excess noise stemming largely from gawbs , as we have already mentioned .    in the left panel of figure  3 we sketch density plots of the projections on the coordinate planes of the previous wigner function ( including the particular case of a coherent state ) .",
    "the contours agree with the 3.8 @xmath139 0.3 db squeezing that was directly measured from the variances .",
    "the projections on the planes @xmath135-@xmath136 and @xmath136-@xmath137 show an additional spreading of the state in the @xmath136 direction caused by the imperfect polarization contrast in the measurement setup that mixes some of the antisqueezing on the @xmath136 direction .",
    "this radon reconstruction requires a large set of measured data to get a reasonably accurate representation of the state .",
    "there are two main reasons for this : integrals are approximated by finite sums ( in our case , we used 751 bins in 91 steps ) and the kernel ( [ kersing ] ) is singular , so some _ ad hoc _ filtering of the raw data is needed . acquiring",
    "such large data sets may be unwise , for it demands long measurement times . ensuring the proper stability of the setup is thus essential and",
    "might be difficult depending on the quantum state measured .",
    "this limitation may be circumvented by adopting a statistically - motivated method , such as the maximum likelihood ( ml )  @xcite . in our case",
    ", the relation between the wigner function @xmath140 and the tomograms @xmath141 can be written as a system of linear equations @xmath142 where the subscripts in @xmath143 and @xmath144 is a shorthand notation for the respectives coordinates .",
    "the coefficients @xmath145 can be interpreted as the overlap of the @xmath146th projector with the @xmath147th volume element of the wigner function and can be readily determined from equations  ( [ eq : wignsu2agar ] ) and ( [ cojo ] ) . the most likely wigner function",
    "is then found by minimizing the kullback - leibler divergence between the normalized vectors of the computed tomograms @xmath148 and recorded ones @xmath149 .",
    "technically , this can be achieved by the iterative expectation - maximization algorithm  @xcite @xmath150 which converges monotonously to the ml estimate from any strictly positive initial vector @xmath151 .",
    "the significantly greater stability of the statistical inversion allows us to get reconstructions of the same quality but from far smaller data sets .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  4 , where we draw a comparison between radon and ml methods , although in the latter case using only nine different settings of the angles @xmath152 , which amounts to reducing the measurements by two orders of magnitude . in other words , the measuring time",
    "is shortened from eight hours to less than five minutes !",
    "this result indicates that the experimental characterization of considerably more complicated quantum states with less symmetries should still be within the reach of the present measurement setup .    as we have discussed in section  [ sec : darkplane ] , the dark plane is of special interest .",
    "the theory shows that the reconstruction therein can be obtained in two different ways : either by reconstructing the dark mode directly from the histograms or by calculating projection of the 3d wigner function along the @xmath136 direction .",
    "the two results are compared in figure  [ fig : darkplane ] and good agreement within the experimental uncertainties is found .",
    "since the radon transform should provide a plausible explanation for all the measured histograms , such a comparison may serve as an independent test of the quality of the 3d tomography .",
    "right panel : ml reconstruction from dark - plane histograms .",
    "only nine settings of angles @xmath45 and @xmath153 were used for the ml tomography .",
    "[ fig : darkplane ] ]    finally , the high confidence levels of the gaussianity tests seems to call for a gaussian ml reconstruction .",
    "the gaussianity is used as a prior information about the signal , which helps to reduce drastically the number of free parameters . in this case , the wigner function is represented by the @xmath154 covariance matrix @xmath155 : @xmath156 and the calculated variances @xmath157 are matched ( in the ml sense ) to the actually measured variances  @xcite . since @xmath155 must be positive semidefinite , only six real parameters describe the measured system and the problem is highly overdetermined , in consequence , the gaussian state can be obtained from a few histograms . in principle , by comparing gaussian reconstructions based on different subsets of measured data , various imperfections of the setup , such as instabilities and biases , can be detected .",
    "the matrix @xmath155 turns out to be @xmath158 which once diagonalized gives the principal variances 0.43962 , 1.13853 , and 309.22177 ( in shot - noise units ) .",
    "this agrees well with the standard and ml reconstructions , as can be also appreciated in figure  4 .",
    "the gaussian reconstruction was done without assuming a particular orientation or symmetry of the state with respect to the stokes coordinates .",
    "the covariance matrix suggests that the misalignment of the principal axis is less than @xmath159 degrees within the measurement errors , in accordance with the definition of angles adopted in the experiment .",
    "this gaussian approach allows for a simple estimate of the errors : just take the pseudoinversion of the measurement matrix as a linear model and use the standard theory of error propagation .",
    "the errors to be propagated are actually the errors in the estimated variances for each tomogram , which are found from the @xmath131 distribution . in addition",
    ", we can assume that the variances of different tomograms are uncorrelated .",
    "taking a 97.5  % confidence interval ( which corresponds to three standard deviations ) , the principal variances can be written as @xmath160 note that the relative errors in the two larger variances are roughly the same ( @xmath161 0.1  % ) , while for the smallest variance is four times larger .",
    "this is a consequence of the experimental setup : the smallest variance is directly revealed only in one of the recorded projections used for the reconstruction .",
    "in summary , we have presented a complete programme for the full polarization tomography of quantum states . using the su(2 )",
    "wigner function , we have provided an exact inversion formula in terms of the histograms of a standard stokes measurement and derived a simplified version for very localized , high intensity states which turns out to be an inverse radon transform . as a test of the theory ,",
    "the reconstruction of an intense polarization squeezed state has been performed .",
    "a ml reconstruction algorithm has also been presented and has been compared to the direct method , thereby yielding an excellent agreement .",
    "of course , the technique can be readily used for any other polarization state .",

    "<S> we reconstruct the polarization sector of a bright polarization squeezed beam starting from a complete set of stokes measurements . given the symmetry that underlies the polarization structure of quantum fields , we use the unique su(2 ) wigner distribution to represent states . in the limit of localized and bright states , </S>",
    "<S> the wigner function can be approximated by an inverse three - dimensional radon transform . </S>",
    "<S> we compare this direct reconstruction with the results of a maximum likelihood estimation , finding an excellent agreement . </S>"
