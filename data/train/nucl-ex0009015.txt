    "this `` parity inversion '' is correctly predicted by , for example , recent psd - shell calculations of brown  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15 intruder orbital is lowered by the non - central part of the particle - hole interaction  @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath0be is often regarded as the classic one - neutron halo nucleus : the small single - neutron separation energy of 505  kev together with an assumed @xmath16-wave nature of the valence neutron leads to a very extended spatial distribution  @xcite .",
    "several calculations of the @xmath0be ground state structure have been performed .",
    "the theoretical approaches include : the shell model  @xcite , the variational shell model  @xcite , the generator coordinate model  @xcite , and coupling of the neutron with a vibrational  @xcite or rotational core  @xcite .",
    "most of these models correctly reproduce the parity inversion and high - energy reaction data , but make very different predictions about the degree of coupling of an s@xmath17 neutron to the @xmath1be @xmath3 ground - state core relative to a d@xmath18 neutron coupled to a @xmath4 excited core ( the first excited state of @xmath1be at 3.368  mev ) .",
    "a direct test of the models for the structure of @xmath0be@xmath6 may be made by measuring the relative cross sections of one - neutron pick - up reactions feeding the 0@xmath19 and 2@xmath19 states of @xmath1be .",
    "transfer cross sections depend on the overlap between the wave functions of the initial and final states through the radial neutron form factors @xmath20(r ) .",
    "standard distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) analyses assume that these form factors are proportional to single particle wave functions @xmath21(r ) , so that one may calculate cross sections independently of any prior assumption about the structure of initial and final states , apart from an overall normalisation factor .",
    "the latter is the spectroscopic factor , which is defined as the product of the overlap integral @xmath22 and a factor @xmath23 @xcite , where @xmath24 in the present case is the neutron occupation number of the 2s1d shell in @xmath1be .",
    "if one expresses the wave function of the 1/2@xmath19 @xmath0be ground state as the sum of the single particle and core excited components @xmath25 the spectroscopic factors s(0@xmath19 ) and s(2@xmath19 ) for transfer to the ground and first excited state of @xmath1be should be directly related to @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , assuming negligible population of the 2s1d orbitals by @xmath1be core neutrons .",

    "the relation between these and spectroscopic factors is given in the appendix and ref .",

    "these spectroscopic factors vary widely .",
    "for example , the standard shell model  @xcite predicts s(0@xmath19 ) = 0.74 and s(2@xmath19 ) = 0.19 , while the variational shell model  @xcite gives s(0@xmath19 ) = 0.55 and s(2@xmath19 ) = 0.40 . also given in the table",

    "this ratio shows large variations , although all models agree that the @xmath4 admixture is smaller than the 2s component .",
    "the dominance of the 2s component is also the conclusion of some recent experimental investigations  @xcite .",
    "however , the precise amount of core - excitation in the @xmath0be ground state wavefunction remains uncertain .",
    ".coupling of the @xmath0be ground state with the @xmath3 0.0  mev and @xmath4 3.37  mev states @xmath1be , as predicted by different structure calculations .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : vibpar ]    a smaller core - excitation ( s@xmath30 ) , is predicted by the calculations vib-1b and vib-2b , which have a more standard , smaller spin - orbit strength , corresponding to a thomas - fermi @xmath31 factor of 25 .",
    "this requires an increased deformation parameter @xmath32 of approximately 0.9 to reproduce the experimental binding energies .",
    "theoretical cross sections for direct transfer using external form factors were calculated with the code dwuck4 @xcite . the use of vibrational form factors ( normalised to unity ) in place of the se ones in dwba or adba calculations neither appreciably modifies the shape of angular distributions nor the magnitude of the 0@xmath19 cross section , but enhances the theoretical cross section for the 2@xmath19 state by typically a factor of two .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effect of the coupling on the radial wave functions is only minor for s@xmath17 , but significantly shifts the d@xmath18 form factor outwards , increasing its magnitude by about 40% in the important asymptotic region outside the nucleus .",
    "this is responsible for the strong difference between the cross sections calculated with the vibrational coupling model and the se method .",
    "the omission of these coupling effects must cast some doubt on the physical meaning of the s(2@xmath19 ) and @xmath29 values deduced from the se method , as plotted in fig .",

    "s(@xmath4 ) values obtained using se form factors ( section  [ sec : secalcs ] ) are also given ( within parentheses ) in table  [ tab : vibpar ] for comparison .",

    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ angdist_vibcoup ] , which shows the results obtained with optical parameter set @xmath34 , and vibrational form factors corresponding to different well parameters , without any further renormalisation to the data ( i.e.  the s@xmath35 factors are implicitly used in these calculations ) .",
    "as was the case for the se method in section  [ sec : secalcs ] , the calculated cross sections agree well with the revised last angle data point in the 2@xmath19 distribution .",
    "note that the calculated 2@xmath19 cross sections are not proportional to the theoretical spectroscopic factors , since the vib-1 and vib-2 cross sections differ by a factor 1.5 for the same s@xmath36 value ( 0.16 ) .",
    "the best agreement between experimental and theoretical cross sections for the 2@xmath19 state is obtained using form factors vib-1 , calculated with the large spin - orbit parameter ( @xmath37 = 15.4 mev ) needed to reproduce the energy of the excited 1/2@xmath38 state with the same woods - saxon well . by contrast , the vib-1b and vib-2b results ( with standard spin - orbit strengths and @xmath32 values of @xmath39 ) underestimate the @xmath4 cross section by a factors of 1.4 and 1.9 , respectively .",
    "direct transfer calculations were also performed with radial form factors from the core excitation model ( cem ) of nunes et al .",
    "this model assumes a rotational structure for the @xmath1be core and possible population of the 2s@xmath17 , 1d@xmath18 and 1d@xmath40 by the valence neutron .",
    "we have taken spectroscopic factors of 0.85 , 0.13 and 0.02 for these levels , respectively ( parameter set be12-b from ref .",
    "the predicted cross sections , again with the optical parameter set @xmath34 , are shown as dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ angdist_vibcoup ] .",
    "they are rather similar to the results of the vibrational form factors ( vib-1 ) and reproduce the data fairly well .",
    "the @xmath29 value deduced from the present analysis of the p(@xmath0be,@xmath1be)d cross sections therefore provides evidence for a dominant ( @xmath41 ) coupling of the halo @xmath13 ground state of @xmath0be to the @xmath3 ground state of @xmath1be .",
    "the absolute @xmath42 spectroscopic factor depends on the geometry adopted for the neutron well , as might be expected , but it was found not to be substantially modified by the channel coupling treatment of form factors ( unlike the case of the @xmath4 transition ) . considering the uncertainties from optical potentials alone , the present ( p , d ) experimental value ( 0.67 or 0.80 , for geometrical parameters 1 or 2 , respectively ) , may be considered in good agreement with the theoretical predictions s@xmath43 of the vibrational coupling model in table  [ tab : vibpar ]",
    ".    both of our experimental and theoretical results for the ground state transition are also in good agreement with the results of two previous ( d , p ) experiments which used radioactive @xmath1be targets .",
    "these experiments gave spectroscopic factors of 0.73 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) and 0.77 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) for incident deuteron energies of 12  mev and 25  mev , respectively . one can also compare the ( d , p ) values for the transition between the @xmath1be@xmath6 and the first @xmath14 state at 0.32  mev in @xmath0be , 0.63 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) and 0.96 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , with our calculated values s@xmath44 which range between 0.61 and 0.84 ( table  [ tab : vibpar ] ) .",
    "an important question is whether processes involving inelastic excitation in @xmath1be and @xmath0be could contribute to modify the 2@xmath19 cross section in a significant way , as did the coupling in the form factor .",
    "this has been checked by calculating two - step amplitudes for inelastic excitation followed by transfer ( or vice - versa ) with the zero range code cczr  @xcite , which are then added to the direct transfer amplitude ( with the appropriate phases ) .",
    "the coupling scheme considered in these calculations is shown at the top of in fig .",
    "[ coupling_2step ] .",
    "only one - way coupling was considered for inelastic excitation , as the inelastic coupling strength @xmath32r was taken equal to the experimental value in @xmath1be @xcite extracted with this assumption .",
    "vibrational coupling form factors vib-1 have been used for the s@xmath17 and d@xmath18 neutron transfers .",
    "in addition to the two - step ( p , dd@xmath45 ) excitation of the 2@xmath19 state via the 0@xmath19 ground state of @xmath1be , possible two - step ( pp@xmath45,d ) paths via 3/2@xmath19 and 5/2@xmath19 states in @xmath0be with [ 2@xmath7s@xmath17 ] configuration , were also considered . these 3/2@xmath19 and 5/2@xmath19 states",
    "are predicted to have an excitation energy similar to that of the @xmath1be 2@xmath19 state ( 3.37 mev ) by the weak coupling limit of the vibrational model .",

    "inelastic coupling strengths and s@xmath17 neutron form factors of the ( p , dd@xmath45 ) path were also adopted for ( pp@xmath45,d ) , with the appropriate phases and amplitudes .",

    "optical potential @xmath49 is suitable . on the other hand ,",

    "[ angdist_2step ] have therefore been obtained with the adiabatic deuteron optical potential @xmath50 as the generator of the distorted waves in the ( d+@xmath1be ) channel , whilst the inelastic form factors were proportional to d@xmath51/d@xmath52 , the derivative of the standard deuteron optical potential @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the enhancement of the 2@xmath19 cross section at forward angles from the two - step processes considered here , strongly depends on the optical parameter sets used in the calculations , as they induce large differences in both the direct transfer and the inelastic scattering amplitudes . for @xmath34 , interferences with two - step processes",

    "[ angdist_2step ] ( top panel ) that interferences with the ( pp@xmath45,d ) and ( p , dd@xmath45 ) paths induce a large enhancement of the 2@xmath19 cross section ( by a factor of 2.4 at 0@xmath53 ) relative to direct transfer .",
    "further coupled - reaction - channels ( crc ) calculations have been performed with the finite - range program fresco @xcite .",
    "these were intended partly as a test of the approximation of restricting the coupling to one - way , as done in the calculations of the previous section .",
    "in addition , since the de - excitation of the @xmath4 level is now considered , the effect of dynamical coupling on the @xmath3 cross section can be examined .",
    "finite - range calculations , however , are not compatible with the johnson - soper adba approach which takes into account deuteron breakup effects , since the adiabatic potential used is obtained from the three - body ( core - proton - neutron ) schrdinger equation assuming zero separation between the proton and neutron .",

    "there is a large difference between the one - way coupling and the direct transfer cross sections for this optical model choice .    as regards the transition to @xmath1be @xmath3 ground state , the fr direct , one - way coupling ( now including the 2@xmath19 to 0@xmath19 de - excitation ) and full coupled channels angular distributions all show obvious differences in magnitudes , with the one - way coupling distribution having in addition a small angular displacement in the minimum compared to the others ( fig .",

    "one should be aware of a possible problem with these comparisons , in that the same optical potentials have been used for the direct and coupled - channels calculations rather than refitting the parameters ( and the @xmath32 coupling strength ) to elastic and inelastic scattering data with the same model , had such data existed .",
    "nevertheless , it seems clear that coupling to inelastic channels could in principle affect not only the @xmath1be @xmath4 and @xmath3 cross sections , but , more importantly , the ratio @xmath29 .      as mentioned in section  [ sec : crc ] above , one difference between the finite - range fresco and zero - range dwuck programs , is that the former allows the inclusion of the full complex remnant terms ( also known as the `` indirect '' part ) in the interaction potential . to be explicit ,",
    "the prior representation of the interaction for a pickup reaction @xmath57 with @xmath58 is  @xcite    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is an effective nucleon - nucleus interaction and @xmath61 is the distorting potential used for the entrance channel wave @xmath62 .",

    "thus the _ ratio _ of the @xmath4 and @xmath3 cross sections is affected , without the radial wave functions .",
    "the remnant terms appear to take into account the radial extent of the @xmath3 wave function being greater than that of the @xmath4 .      a new method for analyzing ( p , d ) reactions involving a weakly bound halo nucleus ( c+n ) has been developed recently by timofeyuk and johnson  @xcite as an extension to the adba .",
    "their adiabatic approach treats the effect of the recoil excitation and break - up ( reb ) of the halo nucleus on the transfer cross section , by replacing the distorted wave in the p+(c+n ) channel by an effective distorted wave , derived from the potential ( p+c ) according to a definite prescription .",
    "the distorted wave function in the ( d+c ) channel is obtained as in the adba , to account for the effect of deuteron break - up on neutron transfer .",
    "the application of this method to the @xmath0be(p , d)@xmath1be reaction at 35 mev shows that reb enhances forward angle cross sections of the 0@xmath19 and 2@xmath19 states , leading to an appreciable reduction of corresponding spectroscopic factors ( multiplied by about 0.54 and 0.71 , respectively )  @xcite .",

    "such a dominance of the s - wave component is in agreement with many theoretical calculations ( e.g. , refs .",

    "the radial wave functions @xmath20(r ) obtained by solving coupled equations can be directly used in the calculation of transfer cross sections by dwba and/or crc methods , so that the comparison of theoretical and experimental results provides a test of the validity of the present vibrational coupling model and other ingredients such as optical potential parameters .",
    "another possible procedure is to normalise the calculated wave functions by dividing them by @xmath94 , and use the renormalised u@xmath95(r ) as `` realistic '' form factors in dwba analysis , thus giving experimental spectroscopic factors expected to be more reliable than those extracted by the conventional se method .",
    "both methods were used in the present analysis of the @xmath0be(p , d)@xmath1be reaction .",
