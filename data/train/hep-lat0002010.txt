    "recent developments in lattice qcd have shown that chiral symmetry can be realized on the lattice without fermion doubling ( for recent reviews see e.g. refs.@xcite ) , circumventing the nielsen - ninomiya theorem  @xcite .",
    "this has been achieved by introducing an overlap - dirac operator  @xcite derived from the overlap formulation of chiral fermions  @xcite .",
    "the simplest such example , for a massless fermion , is given by the neuberger - dirac operator  @xcite @xmath2,\\\\ x & = & d_{\\rm w } - { 1\\over a}\\rho , \\label{nop}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the wilson - dirac operator ( with the wilson parameter @xmath4 set to its standard value , @xmath5 ) @xmath6,\\ ] ] @xmath7,\\ ] ] @xmath8 is the lattice spacing and @xmath9 is a real parameter subject to the constraint @xmath10 .",
    "nonperturbatively one expects @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the critical mass associated with the wilson - dirac operator .",
    "@xmath13 satisfies the ginsparg - wilson relation  @xcite @xmath14 which protects the quark masses from additive renormalization  @xcite .",
    "lattice gauge theories with ginsparg - wilson fermions have been proved to be renormalizable to all orders of perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the ginsparg - wilson relation allows us to write , at finite lattice spacing , relations that are essentially equivalent to those holding in the low - energy phenomenology associated with chiral symmetry ( see e.g. refs .",
    "it indeed implies the existence of an exact chiral symmetry of the lattice action under the transformation  @xcite @xmath15 which can be extended to the flavour non - singlet case\\gamma_5 \\epsilon , \\label{latchsym2}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "all these symmetries are essentially equivalent , leading to equivalent ward identities  @xcite . ] .",
    "the axial anomaly then arises from the non - invariance of the fermion integral measure under flavour - singlet chiral transformations @xcite . a lattice formulation of qcd satisfying the ginsparg - wilson relation overcomes the complications of the standard approach ( e.g. wilson fermions ) , where chiral symmetry is violated at the scale of the lattice spacing .",
    "the chiral symmetry ensures that the hadron masses are free of @xmath17 discretization errors .",
    "indeed their leading scaling corrections are @xmath18 .",
    "the important point is that lattice dirac operators satisfying eq .",
    "( [ gwrel ] ) are not affected by the nielsen - ninomiya theorem  @xcite , thus they need not suffer from fermion doubling .",
    "indeed , @xmath13 avoids fermion doubling .",
    "the locality properties of @xmath13 in the presence of a gauge field are not obvious .",
    "@xmath13 is not strictly local , but locality should be recovered in a more general sense , i.e. allowing an exponential decay of the kernel of @xmath13 with a rate which scales with the lattice spacing and not with the physical quantities  @xcite .",
    "thus , the neuberger - dirac operator seems to have all the right properties that a lattice dirac operator should have in order to describe massless quarks .",
    "however , its complexity renders its numerical implementation very demanding . in this respect",
    "some progress has been achieved ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) , and monte carlo simulations seem to be already feasible , at least in quenched approximation .",
    "the matrix elements of the fermionic currents are employed to predict hadronic decay constants , electromagnetic and weak form factors , quark masses , etc .",
    "a knowledge of their lattice renormalization constants is necessary to relate the matrix elements computed using lattice simulations to the corresponding ones defined using continuous renormalization schemes in experimental data analysis . in this paper",
    "we compute , to one loop in perturbation theory , the renormalization constants of local bilinear quark operators @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes the generic dirac matrix , in the lattice formulation of qcd using the neuberger - dirac operator .",
    "we also extend our computation to quark bilinears which are more extended and have improved chiral properties . in view of the better chiral behaviour of the neuberger - dirac operator , we expect it to have a wider use in monte carlo studies of hadronic physics ; such studies require knowledge of the above renormalization constants .",
    "perturbative computations are much more cumbersome than in the case of wilson fermions , due to the more complicated structure of the neuberger - dirac operator @xcite .",
    "one - loop calculations are already quite complicated , and require the use of symbolic manipulation packages .",
    "we have developed such a package in mathematica .",
    "an example of one - loop calculation using the neuberger - dirac operator is reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we computed the ratio @xmath19 between the @xmath20-parameters of the lattice formulation and of the @xmath21 renormalization scheme .",
    "nonperturbative methods to estimate the renormalization constants , such as those of refs .",
    "@xcite would in general be preferable to approximations based on perturbative calculations , due to their better controlled systematic errors ( @xmath17 against @xmath22 ) .",
    "however , perturbative estimates may still be quite useful .",
    "they indeed provide important consistency checks .",
    "further , in those cases where nonperturbative methods are very costly to implement , as in the case of the neuberger formulation of the dirac operator , perturbative methods may remain the only source of quantitative information .",
    "one could , of course , define exactly conserved vector and axial currents having @xmath23 , following noether s procedure , ( i.e. performing variations of the action with respect to the non - singlet chiral transformations of eq .",
    "( [ latchsym ] ) ) . however , these noether currents are rather complicated extended objects , which might be cumbersome to use in actual simulations .",
    "their expressions for the neuberger - dirac operator can be found in ref .",

    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we report the one - loop calculations necessary for the evaluation of the lattice renormalizations of the two - quark operators . in sec .

    "the observables we study are bilinear quark operators of the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes generic dirac matrices , i.e. @xmath34 specific bilinear operators are denoted according to their lorentz group transformations : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 . in the above definitions ,",
    "flavour indices are left unspecified .",
    "indeed , this is sufficient for our purpose , since one - loop calculations are unaffected .",
    "the lattice renormalization constants @xmath40 of the operators @xmath41 are defined once a renormalization scheme is given : we will consider the @xmath21 renormalization scheme . in order to simplify our calculations we work with zero quark mass .",
    "this is justified by the fact that renormalization constants in the @xmath21 scheme are independent of the fermionic mass .",
    "we also introduce the following bilinear operators @xmath42 which are extended , and local only in the more general sense holding for @xmath13 .",
    "they are interesting since under the lattice chiral symmetry of eq .",
    "( [ latchsym ] ) they transform as the corresponding operators in the continuum .",
    "indeed one can easily check that @xmath43 and under the non - singlet transformations @xmath44 the vector and axial currents @xmath45 and @xmath46 transform as @xmath47 using the corresponding ward identities one can show that @xmath48 we mention that , as pointed out in refs .",

    "( [ latchsym ] ) , is related , for finite lattice spacing , to the vacuum expectation value ( condensate ) of the operator @xmath49 , i.e. it occurs if @xmath50 .",
    "one can also prove that the renormalization constants of @xmath51 coincide with those of the corresponding operators @xmath52 .",
    "this can be seen from the path integral representation for @xmath40 : upon fermionic integration , the factor of @xmath53 in the definition of @xmath54 will cancel against a fermion propagator ; there will remain another propagator which will give a vanishing contribution to @xmath40 , since it can not develop any @xmath55 singularities ( by virtue of chiral invariance , which forbids additive mass renormalization ) .",
