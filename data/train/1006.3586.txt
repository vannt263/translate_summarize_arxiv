    "it is the first example of a truly atomic two - dimensional @xmath1 crystalline system and it is the basic building blocks for graphitic materials such as fullerenes ( graphene balled into a sphere ) or carbon nanotubes ( graphene rolled - up in cylinders ) @xcite .",

    "experimental techniques provide high - quality graphene crystallites up to @xmath3 in size , which is sufficient for most research purpose , including the ones considered here . in this `` perfect '' layer",
    "the charge carries can travel thousands of interatomic distances without scattering.,width=226 ]    where @xmath4 is the fermi velocity , which plays the role of the speed of light ( @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 are the @xmath0 pauli matrices , @xmath7 is the linear momentum operator and @xmath8 is a two - component spinor .",
    "therefore , the quasiparticles can be viewed as electrons that have lost their masses or as ( massless ) neutrinos that acquired the electronic charge .",
    "such a spectrum makes graphene a material with unique electronic properties .",
    "its description by means of the dirac equation is a direct consequence of graphene?s crystal symmetry .",
    "its honeycomb lattice is made up of two equivalent triangular carbon sublattices @xmath9 and @xmath10 , whereas its cosine - like energy bands associated with the sublattices intersect at zero energy @xmath11 near the edges of the brillouin zone , giving rise to a conical section spectrum at low energies@xcite , say , @xmath12 ev . in this honeycomb lattice , the two - component spinor @xmath8 is referred to as pseudospin since it is an index indicating two interpenetrating triangular sublattices @xmath9 e @xmath10 , which is similar to spin index ( up and down ) in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "it is common to regard the sublattice degree of freedom as a pseudospin , with the @xmath9 sublattice being the  up \" , @xmath13 and @xmath10 sublattice being the  down \" , @xmath14 , i.e. ,    @xmath15     + since @xmath16 , it is a slow relativistic system or a strong coupling version of qed since the graphene s dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath17 much higher than its qed analogue , the fine structure constant @xmath18 .",
    "all these properties make the graphene a very interesting system , which provides a way to probe qed phenomena , for instance , by measuring its electronic properties .",
    "several proposals for testing some predicted , but not yet observed phenomena in qed , including the klein paradox @xcite , vacuum polarization @xcite and atomic collapse @xcite , are some topics under investigation in graphene .    here",
    ", we would like to study the behavior of graphene quasiparticles in the presence of defects in the crystalline structure of the material .",
    "we shall consider three types of defects : holes , pentagons and heptagons .",
    "all these defects can be incorporated by removing or inserting a few carbon atoms .",
    "understanding how these defects modify the transport properties of graphene is crucial to achieve future electronic devices using carbon - made materials .",
    "the presence of defects like pentagons ( heptagons ) induces positive ( negative ) curvature in the material . at some extent",
    "the charge carriers motion in the presence of pentagonal ( heptagonal ) defects is identical to fermions moving in a @xmath2 gravitational space - time generated by positive ( `` negative '' ) point - like masses .",
    "then we may employ results from gravity to analyze some effects concerning charge carriers in the presence of such defects .",
    "for instance , in the presence of pentagons and heptagons we found that the phase shifts of the carriers moving near these defects depend only on the number of pentagons or heptagons in the graphene sheet and are identical for charge carriers in the sublattice @xmath9 or @xmath10 . in the case of the holes we computed the phase shifts for the scattered electrons and found that at low concentration they are irrelevant for the electrons transport giving no appreciable contribution to the resistivity",
    "in this section we discuss the scattering of the charge carriers in a non - simply connected graphene sheet . in the continuum model for the graphene",
    ", it is assumed that there is a hole of radius @xmath19 cut from the system center , located at the origin .",
    "thus the motion of the quasiparticles is performed on a flat @xmath0 support given by a non - simply connected manifold , which can be viewed as defect in the material .",
    "this model allows for the investigation of scattering effects as a function of the hole radius and could shed some light on the high charge carrier mobilities , fact observed in graphene @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is interesting to compare our results with the scattering by a short - range potential because it appears that in the case of graphene the contribution of such small defects to the resistivity is essentially smaller than for conventional nonrelativistic two - dimensional electron gas @xcite . to determine the phase - shift of the scattered wave function as well as the scattering cross section one has to solve the two - dimensional dirac equation ( [ dirac ] ) which , for the case of massless particles , can be writing in a covariant form , like below :    [ dirac covariante ] i^_(x)=0 , + where the covariant derivative is @xmath20 $ ] , the @xmath21-matrices are @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24 obeying @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the minkowski tensor metric",

    "we may expand the solutions of the free massless dirac equation in plane waves , once rotational invariance allows to separate the @xmath31 variable , so that the diagonalized angular momentum @xmath32 , yielding partial waves with angular momentum @xmath33 , takes the form ,    ( , t)=e^i(n+12 - 12 ^ 3)u_n(r)e^-iet/. + the components of the radial spinor @xmath34 , given by @xmath35 and @xmath36 , satisfy the bessel equation of order @xmath37 and @xmath38 , say :    [ bessel equations ] + 1r+(k^2-)f_n(r)=0 , + + 1r+(k^2-)g_n(r)=0 , + where @xmath39 is the angular - momentum number and @xmath40 ( we are considering only solutions with @xmath41 that describe the electronic dynamics ) .",
    "remember that the spinor index in graphene labels its two crystal sublattices rather than directions of the actual spin .",
    "the solution for the radial spinor outside of the hole ( i.e. , for @xmath42 ) is given by :    [ general solution ] u_n(r)&= & (    c f_n(r ) + g_n(r )    ) + & = & (    c b_1nj_n(k r ) + b_2nn_n(k r ) + b_3nj_n+1(k r ) + b_4nn_n+1(k r ) +    ) , + where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the bessel functions of first and second kinds ( neumann function ) , respectively , whereas @xmath45 are constants .",
    "these constants must be determined by the appropriate boundary conditions specified to completely define the problem . from the physical point of view",
    ", the correct boundary condition is determined by the requirement of vanishing the net energy flux into the hole , which is a region absent of lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "consequently , the fields must arrange themselves in such a way that the energy flux from the incoming modes ( asymptotically behaving like @xmath46 ) exactly cancel that from the outgoing waves .",
    "let us recall that in the case without a hole , one has :    [ solution without a hole ] u_n(r)= (    c b_1nj_n(k r ) + b_3nj_n+1(k r ) +    ) .",

    "an intuitive understanding of the result ( [ resistivity with a hole ] ) let us recall that light does not experience obstacles with sizes much smaller than its wavelength , whereas massless dirac electrons have the same dispersion relation behaving as light in some aspects ( duality wave - particle ) . this same interpretation can explain the results for a short range potential @xcite .",

    "in fact , the missed link of each carbon atom resting at the two edges of the remaining graphene sheet can be , in principle , covalently bounded .",
    "the nucleation and growth of curved carbon structures remain to be well - understood .",
    "it is claimed that the occurrence of pentagons , which yields @xmath72 disclination defects in hexagonal graphitic network , is a key element in this scenario .",
    "particularly , considering the symmetry of a graphitic sheet and the euler theorem , it can be shown that only five types of cones ( incorporating one to five pentagons ) can be made of a continuous graphene sheet @xcite . in the case of a cone with @xmath73 , the value @xmath66 , @xmath74 is related to the conical angle @xmath21 :    [ angulosuperficie ] 2=1- .",

    "the pentagonal defect can be presented as a pseudo - magnetic vortex at the apex of a graphitic cone , being the flux of the vortex related to the deficit angle of the cone ( see ref .",
    "the possible five graphitic cones mentioned earlier are then given by @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "cones with a heptagon have negative curvature and are obtained by a insertion of a angular sector in the carbon sheet . then if @xmath77 , @xmath78 counts the number of such sectors inserted into the graphene sheet . our aim is , therefore , to see the influences that such a special graphene structure could induce on quasiparticle wavefunctions ( spinors )",
