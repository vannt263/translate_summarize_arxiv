    "the @xmath2-based calibration is combined with the @xmath4-based calibration .",
    "there are several regimes of particle type and energy relevant to this precise calorimeter calibration : the primary electron from the @xmath0 boson decay , with incident energy in the @xmath5 gev range ; radiated photons from the primary electron , with incident energies of @xmath6 mev to @xmath7 gev ; and @xmath8 gev electrons from the conversion of photons  mev curl up in the tracker s magnetic field and do not reach the calorimeter . ] radiated by the primary electron .",
    "the cem is a lead - scintillator sampling calorimeter . to simulate its response to incident electrons and photons of these energies",
    ", we parameterize the following quantities :    * the fraction of the incident particle s energy that leaks out the back of the cem ; * the fraction of the deposited energy sampled by the scintillators ; * the sampling fluctuations in the scintillator energy fraction ; and * the loss of response due to absorption and back - scatter of low - energy particles .    in the following",
    "we describe the detailed detector geometry implemented in geant4 ( section  [ sec : geantgeometry ] ) ; the fractional energy leakage for a given particle type and energy ( section  [ sec : leakage ] ) ; the sampling fraction and resolution of the calorimeter ( section  [ sec : samplingmodel ] ) ; and the absorption of energy in the passive material that results in a non - linear calorimeter response ( section  [ sec : nonlinearity ] ) .",
