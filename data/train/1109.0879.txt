    "dispersion relation is the basic property of light propagating in mediums , which specifies the relation between the wavevector @xmath0 and the frequency @xmath1 of the light .",
    "recently , the light propagation in metallic nanostructures has attracted enormous attentions from researchers due to the excitation of the surface plasmon - polaritons(spps )  @xcite by the light .",
    "the spps are known for the wide application in nano optics attributed to the spatial localization of the spps at the metal - dielectric interfaces , which can be guided to manipulate light in nanoscaled photonic circuitry  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the spatial confinement of the spps can enhance the field intensity at the interfaces , which can influence the luminescence intensities  @xcite and life time of emitters close to the interfaces .",
    "@xcite in order to understand the physical properties of spps in plasmonic structures , it is important to get the dispersion relations of light propagation in the plasmonic structures .",
    "principally , the dispersion relations can be obtained by solving the maxwell equations with the boundary conditions of the plasmonic structures imposed . for simple plasmonic structures , such as planar metal surfaces ,",
    "the dispersion of spps can be solved analytically .",
    "@xcite but for the most structures which are nonsymmetrical and irregular , codes such as finite - element method ( fem ) and finite - difference time - domain techniques ( fdtd ) need to be applied for numerical calculations .",
    "the basic technique of fem or fdtd is to discrete the maxwell equations , which are known for the time consumption .",
    "fortunately , for some symmetric structures , such as cylindrical nanowires ,  @xcite the maxwell equations imposed with the boundary conditions can be transformed into a dispersion equation .",
    "solving the dispersion equation can improve the efficiency to get the dispersion relation rather than the numerical calculation by the discretion of maxwell equations .",
    "the dispersion equation normally is nonlinear and transcendental .",
    "what is more , when the metal loss is introduced into the metal dielectric ,  @xcite the dispersion equation then is a complex and transcendental equation .",
    "thus , the dispersion relations obtained from the complex equation are also complex .",
    "there exist two types of the complex dispersion relations for one same plasmonic structure , specifying either a complex frequency as a function of a real wave vector , noted as @xmath2 for convenience , or a complex wave vector as a function of a real frequency , noted as @xmath3 .",
    "the two types of dispersion relations are rather different , even though they are for one same structure .",
    "the back bending as a characteristic of the @xmath3 relation is absent in the @xmath2 relation .",
    "the latter is an asymptotic curve .  @xcite it has been suggested that the @xmath3 solution of the dispersion relation describes the spps mode decaying spatially while the @xmath2 solution is for the spps decaying in time rather than in space .",
    "@xcite the discrepancy of the two solutions has been considered to be originated from the metal ohmic loss .",
    "@xcite such conclusion is originally drawn from the study of spps on planar metallic - dielectric surfaces .",
    "when a perfect metal without damping is considered in this planar case , the two types of solutions of the spps dispersion relations overlap with a same asymptotic behavior .",
    "when the metal ohmic loss is introduced into the dielectric response of metal , the two types of solutions are then different .",
    "the original of the discrepancy of the two solutions due to the metal loss has also been confirmed in cylindrical metallic nanowires .",
    "@xcite    the main mission to get the dispersion relation of the light propagation in plasmonic structures then is to find the complex roots of the equation .",
    "the complex dispersion equation can be described by @xmath4 with three real variables @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "for example , in the @xmath2 solution , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent the real part of @xmath1 ( @xmath8 $ ] ) , the imaginary part of @xmath1 ( @xmath9 $ ] ) and real wavevector @xmath0 respectively . in the @xmath3 solution , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "then represent the real part of @xmath0 ( @xmath10 $ ] ) , imaginary part of @xmath0 ( @xmath11 $ ] ) and real @xmath1 respectively . to solve this complex equation , normally one variable is given , say @xmath7 ,",
    "then the complex equation can be simplified to be a complex equation @xmath12 with only two real variables .",
    "one commonly used method to solve this equation is to choose all possible values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 in their given ranges to check if they satisfy the equation or not . to achieve this purpose , a coordination system with @xmath5 and @xmath6 axis",
    "is gridded with an enough small mesh size and then the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 at each grid point are substituted into the equation .",
    "considering the error allowance @xmath13 , the criterion for this grid method is to find the roots @xmath14 if they satisfy @xmath15 . to this grid method ,",
    "there exit two main short comings .",
    "the first is that in order to get the full solutions to the equation , one needs to gird the coordinate system with an enough small mesh size . or",
    ", the solutions may be lost . however , in the reality for the calculation , we find that the mesh size can reach the order of the magnitude of @xmath16 and even smaller , which increases the computation time .",
    "the second shortcoming is that the criterion can not guarantee the @xmath14 to be the root even though they satisfy the criterion since @xmath13 is not rigorously equal to zero .",
    "no matter how small the @xmath13 is taken , the second shortcoming still remains since @xmath17 . to improve the computation efficiency , the alternative method is the newton - raphson ( nr ) method , which can converge to the roots of the equation quickly .",
    "however , it is well known that the nr method may miss the roots if there exist multiroots of the equation .",
    "what is more , the nr method may not converge if the initial estimate is not close enough to the root , or may converge to wrong root .",
    "especially for the complex transcendental equation , which is very common for the light propagation in plasmonic structures when the metal ohmic loss is introduced , the nr method will lose its power to find the roots . in this paper",
    ", we propose one new method to find full complex roots of complex transcendental equations . as an example for the application , the dispersion equation of light propagating in a cylindrical metallic nanowire",
    "is investigated .",
    "and @xmath18 are the mesh sizes along @xmath5 and @xmath6 axis respectively . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are assumed to be the roots of the equation , enclosed in mesh a and mesh b respectively .",
    "the former is used for the linear approximation , while the latter is for the parabola approximation .",
    ", width=192,height=259 ]    the main mission of our method to solve the complex equation @xmath12 is to find criterions used to judge if the values of the variables are the roots or not .",
    "similarly to the grid method , the coordination system with @xmath5 and @xmath6 axis is gridded firstly .",
    "suppose that @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the roots of the equation satisfying @xmath23 and the point @xmath19 is enclosed in the mesh a(fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] ) , then the function at each point of the mesh corner can be expanded at the point @xmath19 by the first order taylor series as    [ eq.1 ] @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27    here , subscript @xmath28 of @xmath29 represents the calculated results of the function @xmath30 at the corner point @xmath31 of mesh a , which has been labeled in the fig .",

    "eq.([eq.1a ] ) subtracted from eq.([eq.1b ] ) gives    [ eq.2 ] @xmath38 and eq.([eq.1a ] ) subtracted from eq.([eq.1c ] ) gives @xmath39    the @xmath40 and @xmath18 are the mesh sizes along the @xmath5 and @xmath6 axis respectively , which are given as constants when gridding the coordination system .",

    "now we give the criterion to find the roots of the equation .",
    "if the @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the roots of the complex equation satisfying @xmath23 , then    [ eq.4 ] @xmath47 must be held . or , there exists no root in the grid a due to the @xmath48 in eq.([eq.1 ] ) .",
    "considering the error allowance @xmath13 , criterion ( [ eq.4a ] ) can be modified as @xmath49    by using this method , the correct mesh enclosing the root can be found .",
    "and then we can further gird the correct mesh and consider the grid point with the minimum value of @xmath50 in the mesh as the root of the equation , at least they are very close to the roots .",
    "we note that in our method the criterion @xmath51 is not fatal for the determination of the roots . and",
    "the function values @xmath50 at the points considered as the roots may be larger than the error allowance @xmath13 if one wants to save computation time .",
    "the criterion ( [ eq.4 ] ) can guarantee the points close to the exact roots if the points are enclosed in the correct meshes satisfying the criterion ( [ eq.4 ] ) . in our method ,",
    "all the meshes are independent to each other .",
    "thus , all possible roots can be found , overcoming the problem met by the nr method .",
    "what is more , this method focuses on the finding of correct meshes enclosing the roots instead of the finding of correct points matching the roots , which saves much more computation time .",
    "generally , if the derivative @xmath52 in eq.([eq.1 ] ) may equal to zero when the function @xmath30 has a parabola - like shape , we can expand the function with the taylor series up to order two @xmath53 here , @xmath54 is the coefficient for the first order taylor expansion and the @xmath55 is the coefficient for the second order . if the @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the roots of the complex equation , then @xmath58 is held . for illustration ,",

    "[ fig.1 ] .",
    "each point of mesh b used for the calculation has been labeled by @xmath59 in the fig.1 .",

    "each equation can be separated into two equations with respect to the real and imaginary parts of the equation .",
    "now we consider three situations .",
    "the first situation is @xmath70 .",
    "the second situation is @xmath71 . and",

    "last , for the third situation , we then can get four sets of the roots @xmath78 and @xmath79 from the eq.([eq.7 ] ) .",
    "now we give the criterion to find roots of the equation .",
    "if the @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the roots of the complex equation satisfying @xmath58 , then for the eq.([eq.6 ] ) the criterion    [ eq.8 ] @xmath80 must be held . and",
