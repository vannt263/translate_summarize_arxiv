    "the purpose of this note is to present the complete list of static classical solutions of the goldstone model on a circle @xmath0 of radius @xmath1 and the corresponding bifurcation tree together with a study of the stability of our solutions .",
    "it comes as a supplement to a previous note [ 1 ] which was searching for such solutions but with periodicity condition imposed there .",
    "many of the results have obvious similarities with those in [ 1 ] .",
    "we notice those and make comparisons with this reference .",
    "we also check the case of mixed boundary conditions and place a note with our conclusions in the end .",
    "the following analysis has both mathematical [ 8 ] and physical interest as it can be useful for the search of stable solitons in the two - higgs standard model ( 2hsm ) or the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "the langrangian of our model is@xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 real higgs fields and potential of the following form :    @xmath5    we impose antiperiodic boundary conditions on the scalar fields with coordinates @xmath6.$ ]    @xmath7    the general static solution of model ( 1 ) can be expressed in terms of jacobi elliptic functions :    @xmath8    @xmath9    @xmath10    where @xmath11 are constants while @xmath12 denotes the jacobi elliptic function ; @xmath13 @xmath14 are periodic functions on the real axis with periods @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "@xmath17 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind . inserting ( 4)-(6 ) into the equations corresponding to ( 1 )",
    "leads to several conditions on the parameters and as a consequence to three different types of non - trivial solutions .",
    "we start with the simplest , the trivial solution .",
    "the energy functional for static configurations is given by @xmath18.\\ ] ] apart from the vacuum solutions which have @xmath19 , one can immediately think of the simplest solution , the trivial one    @xmath20    which exists for all values of @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding small oscillation eigenmodes , labeled by @xmath21 , have    @xmath22    this solution is stable until @xmath23 because @xmath24 for @xmath25 . many additional solutions , some of which were discussed in [ 2,3 ] bifurcate from the solution @xmath26 at critical values of @xmath1 .      now , we present without many details the three non - trivial solutions and mention their similarities with those in [ 1 ] .",
    "the simplest case one can think , is to set @xmath27 so that from ( 5 ) we obtain @xmath28 and the solution becomes    @xmath29    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is an integer .",
    "this solution is called type - i .",
    "one can observe that the above solution reduces to ( 8) when @xmath32 i.e. when one of the @xmath33 of equation ( 9 ) crosses zero .",
    "the higgs field winds @xmath34 times around the top of the mexican hat .",
    "it s energy is given by    @xmath35    if we denote the above result which corresponds to the antisymmetric case we study here with @xmath36 and the result of [ 1 ] for the same type of solutions with @xmath37 where @xmath38 means `` symmetric '' and @xmath39 `` antisymmetric '' then we notice that @xmath40    another choice is to set @xmath41 on ( 5 ) so the solution now involves the jacobi elliptic functions .",
    "@xmath42 becomes zero as well and the solution is    @xmath43    this solution is called type - ii . in fact , it corresponds to an oscillation of the higgs field in the @xmath44 plane about the origin @xmath45 .",
    "if we take account of the antiperiodicity condition ( 3 ) , then the argument @xmath46 of the jacobi elliptic function is related to the radius @xmath1 of @xmath0 through the following formula    @xmath47    for some integer @xmath48 .",
    "when we reach the limit of @xmath49 ( i.e. @xmath50 ) the solution ( 13 ) approaches ( 8) . the energy of the solution above is given by the integral    @xmath51\\ ] ]    and by means of elliptic integrals it becomes    @xmath52\\ ] ] two specific values of @xmath46 with the corresponding results follow    for @xmath53    @xmath54    for @xmath55    @xmath56    the comparison of @xmath57 which represents our solutions , with @xmath58 which represents the symmetric case of the same type of solutions studied in [ 1 ] , implies that @xmath59    if none of @xmath60 are zero then we are led to type - iii solutions where we have the following conditions for @xmath60 and @xmath61    @xmath62    @xmath63    here , one can explicitly observe the fact that when @xmath41 then @xmath64 as well . in addition , @xmath65 and @xmath61 must not be negative .",
    "this means another condition    @xmath66    with the equality leading to type - ii solutions .    in order for @xmath67 to satisfy @xmath68 and @xmath65 to be periodic ( so for the solution to be antiperiodic as we want ) on @xmath69 $ ] the following equations must hold :    @xmath70    @xmath71    where @xmath72 are positive integers which respectively determine the number of oscillations of the modulus of the higgs field and the number of the higgs field windings around the origin @xmath45 in a period @xmath73",
    "now we return to ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) and analyze further type - iii solutions . solving these equations for @xmath53 , remembering that @xmath74 , we find the critical values of @xmath1 where these solutions start to exist :    @xmath75    the expression for @xmath76 together with ( 20 ) leads to the condition @xmath77 on the integers @xmath48 and @xmath78 ( @xmath48 and @xmath78 @xmath79 ) . for any @xmath78 and @xmath80 the coefficient of @xmath81 in the integral    \\(6 )",
    "is proportional to @xmath82 and if one expands the solution in powers of @xmath82 is led to the following formulae    @xmath83    @xmath84    @xmath85    this expansion is necessary as there is no closed form for integral ( 21 ) . in the limit @xmath53 we observe that the @xmath86 solutions of type - iii yield the type - i solution with @xmath87 at @xmath88 , where @xmath89 . for fixed values of @xmath90",
    "we find a single solution @xmath91 obeying the following properties    @xmath92    this is illustrated in figure 1 for two different values of the pair @xmath93 by the solid curves , the dashed curve representing the limit ( 20 ) .",

    "this shows that solution iii approaches solution ii in the limit @xmath98 , a fact which also appears in [ 1 ] .    the energies of the solutions of some low - lying branches are presented in figure 2 as functions of @xmath1 . for @xmath99",
    "all four types of solutions coexist and satisfy    @xmath100    the four stars on the upper part of the figure show the position of the four bifurcation points @xmath101 @xmath102 of the @xmath103 solutions respectively from the @xmath104 type - i solution .",
    "the two lower stars show the bifurcation values @xmath105 of the @xmath106 solutions respectively from the @xmath107 type - i solution .",
    "in order to analyze the stability of type - i solutions we follow the steps done in [ 1 ] which uses notions that can be found in [ 10 ] and [ 15 ] . thus perturbing the fields @xmath108 around the classical solution ( 10)-(11 ) , denoted here by @xmath109 ,    @xmath110    we are led to the following equation for the normal modes :    @xmath111    @xmath112    where @xmath113 is the eigenvalue and @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 .",
    "the complete list of eigenvalues of the operator @xmath117 for @xmath118 can be obtained by classifying its invariant subspaces .",
    "this can be done by using the fourier decomposition .",
    "type - i solution has a twisted translational invariance and one can check that for an integer @xmath119 the following finite - dimensional vector spaces ( with @xmath120 ) but they are not , due to a misprint in [ 1 ] . here",
    "we correct this by writing these spaces explicitly in equations ( 34 ) and ( 35 ) . ]",
    "are preserved by @xmath117    @xmath121    @xmath122    under the following condition    @xmath123    where @xmath124 , @xmath125 are arbitrary constants . the operator @xmath117 can then be diagonalized on each of the finite - dimensional vector spaces above , leading to a set of algebraic equations .    to be more specific ,",
    "define @xmath126 , @xmath127 . also , consider the vector    @xmath128 acting with the operator @xmath117 on one of the above vectors ( say @xmath129 ) we have the following steps :    @xmath130    @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the @xmath133 unit matrix and    @xmath134 which has the action    @xmath135 the same happens if we choose @xmath136 instead . in that case , the equation above is @xmath137 as expected .",
    "a matrix which has exactly the same action as above can be found easily and this is @xmath138 .",
    "finally , we observe that    @xmath139 which implies the condition that the determinant of the above matrix must be zero in order to acquire the non - zero eigenvalues .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath117 on @xmath140 are    @xmath141\\nonumber \\\\",

    "notice that if we replace @xmath145 by @xmath146 then the above result is the same with eq.(36 ) of [ 1 ]",
    ".    for @xmath31 having a specific value and @xmath1 slightly greater than @xmath31 , the solution ( 10)-(11 ) possess @xmath147 negative modes corresponding to @xmath148 in ( 37 ) ( minus sign ) .",
    "when @xmath1 increases , the number of positive eigenmodes increases as well    @xmath149    i.e. ( cf(23 ) ) at those values of @xmath1 where the solutions of type - iii with @xmath150 bifurcate from the solution of type - i . for",
    "@xmath151    all the modes are positive and ( 10)-(11 ) are classically stable solitons .",
    "these results are illustrated in figure 2 for @xmath107 and @xmath104 .",
    "the numbers in parentheses represent the number of negative and zero modes of the corresponding branch .",
    "the equations for the fluctuations about the solution ( 13 ) decouple to take the form of lame equations :    @xmath152    @xmath153    where    @xmath154    and @xmath155 is the effective eigenvalue of the relevant operator .",
    "equations ( 40 ) and ( 41 ) admit two and one algebraic modes , respectively , with corresponding eigenvalues    @xmath156    the corresponding values of @xmath113 follow immediately from ( 42 ) ; they have signature ( + , + ) and ( 0 ) , respectively .",
    "it s a property of the lame equation that the solutions determined algebraically correspond to the solutions of the lowest eigenvalues .",
    "the remaining part of the spectrum therefore consists of positive eigenvalues .",
    "the spectrum of the equation ( 40 ) was studied perturbatively in [ 9 ] , while the relation between the lame equation and the manton - samols sphalerons was first pointed out in [ 11 - 13 ] .",
    "concerning the stability equation of type - iii solution , it seems to be more difficult to deal with as the presence of the jacobi elliptic functions prevent us from having an analytic expression for @xmath157 in ( 4 ) .",
    "thus , we are not able to follow the steps done in the case of type - i solutions ( i.e. find the * m * matrix ) where trigonometric functions are easier to handle .",
    "detailed analysis especially for the case of lame equations can be found in [ 12 ] and [ 15 ] .",
    "a detailed analytical study of the static solutions of the goldstone model on a circle has been given in [ 1 ] and we followed the same path here for our boundary conditions .",
    "many results of [ 1 ] are connected with ours by a simple change on variables used .",
    "we write them explicitly above whenever is necessary .",
    "we also note our effort to impose mixed boundary conditions as well . specifically , we enforced @xmath3 to be antiperiodic and @xmath4 periodic but there was no solution to satisfy this choice so it s needless to extend beyond this small remark here .",
    "many details were presented on the stability analysis on section 3 for the solutions found .",
    "classically stable solitons were identified , together with the range of the parameter @xmath1 for which they are stable .",
    "this simpler model we present here and many others can be connected and can also give us the experience to deal with realistic ( 3 + 1)-dimensional particle physics models in our search for possible metastable localized solitons . ref .",
    "[ 1 ] on which this note was based , has connections with [ 9 ] and [ 10 ] as it concerns the branches of their solutions , also with [ 2 - 6 ] , while there are also interesting physical applications [ 14 ] as it is already mentioned in [ 1 ] .",
    "soliton solutions in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional models with antiperiodic boundary condition imposed on one spatial dimension , which is compactified on @xmath0 , is analyzed in [ 16 - 18 ] where supersymmetry breaking is found .",
