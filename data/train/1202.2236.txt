    "blazars are radio loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with their jets pointing towards the observer ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observationally , they come in two main flavours with very different optical spectra .",
    "namely , flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) have strong , broad emission lines , just like radio quiet quasars , while bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) show at most weak emission lines , sometimes display absorption features , and can also be completely featureless .    blazars emit variable , non - thermal radiation across the whole electromagnetic spectrum , which includes two components forming two broad humps in a @xmath4 representation .",
    "the low - energy one is attributed to synchrotron radiation and the high - energy one is usually thought to be due to inverse compton radiation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the peak of the synchrotron emission ( ) can occur over a wide range of frequencies , from about @xmath5 hz to over @xmath6 hz , reflecting the maximum energy at which particles can be accelerated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". blazars with rest - frame  @xmath7  hz are called low synchrotron peaked ( lsp ) sources , while those with @xmath8  hz @xmath9  @xmath10  hz and   @xmath11  hz are called intermediate and high synchrotron peaked ( isp and hsp ) sources , respectively @xcite . these definitions expand on the original division of bl lacs into lbl and hbl sources first introduced by @xcite .",
    "the location of the synchrotron peak implies different mechanisms for the x - ray emission , namely inverse compton in lsps , which have hard energy index ( @xmath12 ) spectra , and an extension of the synchrotron emission responsible for the lower energy continuum in hsps , which typically display steeper ( @xmath13 ) x - ray spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the distribution of the synchrotron peak frequency is extremely different for the two blazar classes .",
    "while the rest - frame  distribution of fsrqs is strongly peaked at low frequencies ( @xmath14@xmath15 hz ) and never reaches high values ( @xmath16 hz ) @xcite , the  distribution of bl lacs is shifted to higher values by at least one order of magnitude and can reach  as high as @xmath17 hz . in other words , while bl lacs can be of the lsp and hsp type , fsrqs appear to be solely lsps .",
    "the origin of this difference has been discussed at length in the literature . in a series of papers , padovani , giommi , and collaborators , looked for hsp fsrqs using multi - wavelength catalogues and the deep x - ray radio blazar survey ( dxrbs ; e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ) with only limited success .",
    "in fact , while fsrqs with  possibly larger than previously known were discovered , follow - up x - ray observations showed in most cases a relatively flat x - ray spectrum .",
    "this , together with their overall spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , was suggestive of inverse compton emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and did not support a possible hsp classification .",
    "the only exception is rgb j1629 + 4008 , with  @xmath18  hz and steep x - ray spectrum @xcite .",
    "roxa j081009.9 + 384757.047 was also suggested to be an hsp @xcite but new wise data @xcite indicate that the near - ir and optical flux can be attributed to accretion ( the big `` blue bump '' ) and that the peak of the non - thermal synchrotron radiation is located in the far infrared , making this object a typical lsp .",
    "the purported non - existence of hsp fsrqs implied also the lack of high - power hsp blazars ( since fsrqs are more powerful than bl lacs ) , which was also hinted at by a suggested anti - correlation between bolometric luminosity and  .",
    "this has been interpreted by some researchers as an _ intrinsic _ physical difference between lsps and hsps . since hsps",
    "are typically characterized by a low intrinsic power and external radiation field , given their very weak or absent emission lines , cooling was thought to be less dramatic than in lsps allowing particles to reach energies high enough to produce synchrotron emission well into the x - ray band @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "rgb 1629 + 4008 , with its relatively low radio power , @xmath19 w hz@xmath20 , was regarded as fitting on the sequence as well @xcite .",
    "@xcite have recently presented a new scenario , where blazars are classified as fsrqs , bl lacs , lsps , or hsps according to a varying mix of the doppler boosted radiation from the jet , emission from the accretion disk , the broad line region , and the host galaxy .",
    "this hypothesis predicts the existence of high power ",
    "high  blazars , which however would be very hard to identify because of their featureless optical spectra and , therefore , lack of redshift .",
    "this is because when both  and radio power are large the dilution by the non - thermal continuum becomes extreme and all optical features are washed away .",
    "very recent results provide a simple way to test this prediction and look for the existence of previously unidentified high power hsps . @xcite",
    "have presented redshift constraints for 103 blazars from the _ fermi _ 2lac catalogue @xcite by fitting sed templates to their uv - to - near - ir multi - band photometry obtained quasi - simultaneously with _",
    "swift_/uvot and grond @xcite .",
    "in fact , attenuation due to neutral hydrogen along the line of sight at the lyman limit allows an accurate estimate of the redshift of the absorber and thereby provides a reliable lower limit to the blazar redshift .",
    "eleven of their objects have @xmath21 and for eight such sources these are the first reliable redshift measurements . since the spectrum of most of these sources is featureless and high redshift typically means high power , this is an ideal sample to look for high power hsps with their lines completely swamped by the non - thermal continuum , which is the purpose of this work .    throughout this paper",
