    "the galactic plane has been known to be a source of hard ( 210 kev ) x - ray emission since the 1980s ( worrall et al .  1982 ; warwick et al .",
    "1985 ; koyama et al .",
    "although most of the x - ray satellites have spent significant amounts of observing time to study the galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) , its origin has not been elucidated yet .",
    "whether the grxe is truly diffuse emission or composed of numerous dim point sources remains inconclusive .",
    "ebisawa et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2005 ) studied a blank galactic plane area at @xmath8 with chandra , consisting of two partially overlapping fields each exposed 100 ksec ( sequence 900021 and 900125 ) .",
    "they found that only 10  15 % of the observed 210 kev grxe was resolved into point sources brighter than @xmath9 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "they also found that the point source surface density in the 2  10 kev band was not significantly higher than that at high galactic latitudes , and therefore the majority of these hard x - ray sources is likely to be the background agns . on the other hand ,",
    "numerous point sources were detected in the soft ( @xmath10 kev ) band which are considered to be nearby galactic sources , hardly contributing to the 2  10 kev grxe .",
    "ebisawa et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2005 ) suggest that the number of galactic hard x - ray sources starts to deplete ( @xmath11 curve begins to saturate ) around @xmath12 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 ( 2  10 kev ) , and they conclude that most of the grxe has the diffuse origin .    meanwhile , revnivtsev et al .",
    "( 2006 ) discovered a striking similarity between the global grxe distribution and that of the near infrared ( nir ) emission at 3.5 @xmath13 m .",
    "since the nir emission is considered to represent the stellar population , this spatial correlation is suggestive of the stellar origin of the grxe . assuming the low - luminosity x - ray source population based on the all - sky rxte and rosat data of the sources in the solar neighborhood ( sazonov et al .",
    "2006 ) , revnivtsev et al .",
    "( 2006 ) proposed that the grxe is ultimately resolved into point sources at @xmath14@xmath15 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 ( 2  10 kev ) .",
    "revnivtsev and sazonov  ( 2007 ) claim that , using the same chandra data as those of ebisawa et al.(2005 ) , @xmath16 of the grxe in 1 7 kev is accounted for by point sources brighter than @xmath17 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 ( interstellar absorption corrected flux ) , and that there is no indication of saturation of the @xmath18 slope down to this flux limit . in order to test the point source origin , one would need more than an order of magnitude lower limiting flux than the current value .",
    "currently only chandra can make the required observations , which would have much deeper ( @xmath19 1 msec ) exposures than those already carried out .",
    "another important property of the grxe is its energy spectrum .",
    "it has been known from previous observations that the spectrum is hard ( e.g , valinia et al .",
    "2000 ) and characterized by many intense emission lines from highly ionized ions of the abundant elements ( e.g. , kaneda et al .",
    "these emission lines , in particular the iron k - emission lines in 67 kev , can constrain the emission mechanism .",
    "suzaku satellite is the best suited for this study , since it is equipped with the x - ray telescopes of large effective areas , and the focal plane detectors of superior spectral resolution .",
    "in addition , suzaku s low and stable background and small stray - light contamination enable us to measure the total surface brightness on the galactic plane accurately , from which we can estimate the absolute grxe flux by subtracting the contribution of the cosmic x - ray background . in this paper , we report the results of a 100 ksec observation of the grxe with suzaku for the same galactic plane field as that of the chandra observation by ebisawa et al ( 2001 , 2005 ) .",
    "suzaku ( mitsuda et al .  2007 ) , the fifth japanese x - ray satellite , was launched on july 10 , 2005 , and carries four x - ray ccd cameras ( x - ray imaging spectrometers ; xis ; koyama et al .",
    "2007a ) at the foci of four x - ray telescopes ( xrt ; serlemitsos et al .  2007 ) and the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; takahashi et al .  2007 ) .",
    "the first suzaku long exposure of the galactic ridge ( sequence number 500009010 ) was carried out during the proprietary period for the science working group , from oct .",
    "28 02:24 to oct .  30 21:30 , 2005 , for 100 ksec .",
    "the pointing center was chosen exactly at the same position as the chandra ao1 field ( sequence number 900021 ) , ( ra , dec)=@xmath20 ( j2000 ) or @xmath21 . since the xis field of view ( @xmath22 ) is comparable to that of chandra acis ( @xmath23 ) , almost the same field was covered ( figure [ fig:1 ] ) .    in the present study , we concentrate on the results obtained from the xis . there are four xis sensors , xis0 to xis3 , of which xis1 carries the back - illuminated chip and all the rest have front illuminated chips .",
    "although xis1 has superior sensitivity and spectral resolution at low energies ( @xmath24 1 kev ) , it suffers from a higher intrinsic background relative to the front - illuminated sensors .",
    "the spaced - row charge injection ( sci ) operation ( nakajima et al .  2007 ) , which later became a regular operational mode , was not performed in the current observation .",
    "processing version of the data used in this study is v.1.2.2.3 , and the software version is heasoft 6.2 .    during our observation , a transient source was found at ( ra , dec)= ( , ) , which is named suzaku j18440404 ( yamauchi et al .  2007 ) . to avoid contamination from the source ,",
    "those events within a two - arcmin radius from the transient source are excluded in the following data analysis ( figure [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "in addition , we exclude the region which contains a part of the supernova remnant g28.60.1 ( bamba et al .",
    "2001 ; ueno et al .",
    "2003 ) ( figure [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "besides these two , no discrete / point sources brighter than @xmath25 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 ( 2 10 kev ) were detected . in other words , point sources dimmer than @xmath25 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 ( 2 10 kev ) , either galactic or extragalactic , are necessarily included in the following grxe spectral analysis .",

    "is defined by excluding the areas of calibration sources and the contamination sources ( figure [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the night earth background spectra are constructed for the same detector region for each sensor . since xis intrinsic background is known to be dependent on the magnetic cut - off rigidity ( cor)(koyama et al .",
    "2007a ; tawa et al .",
    "2007 ) , the night earth background spectra were accumulated for several different cor bins separately , and properly weighted according to the cor distribution during the ridge observation .    since the characteristics of the three front - illuminated chips are almost identical to each other , we combine the data from them and show the average spectrum ( hereafter xis023 ) . in figure",
    "[ bgd ] , we show the observed energy spectra and the corresponding night earth spectra for xis023 ( front - illuminated ) and xis1 ( back - illuminated ) .",
    "if we compare figure [ bgd ] with a corresponding ( background dominated ) figure by chandra ( e.g. , figure 7 in ebisawa et al .",
    "2005 ) , it is evident that suzaku is much more sensitive to extended emission thanks to the large effective area and low background . among four xis sensors , xis0 , 2",
    ", 3 have much lower intrinsic background in 5  8 kev than xis1 , which is particularly advantageous for the study of the iron k - lines .",
    "the telescope response was calculated using the xissimarfgen ftool via ray - tracing ( ishisaki et al .",
    "the assumed sky region of the input photons is a circle with @xmath26 diameter ( 0.139 deg@xmath27 ) , that corresponds to the diagonal of a ccd chip ( figure [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the uniformly distributed photons from the 0.139 deg@xmath27 area are put into the simulator and the number of photons falling onto the selected detector area are calculated for each energy bin .",
    "thus , the `` ancillary response file '' ( arf ) is calculated with the unit of cm@xmath27 .",
    "using this arf in spectral fitting together with the xis response ( `` redistribution matrix file '' ; rmf ) gives the diffuse spectral model in the unit of photons s@xmath2",

    "@xmath3 deg@xmath7 .",
    "suzaku xrt is known to have little stray - light contamination from outside of the field of view ( @xcite ) , in contrast to the similar type telescopes on - board asca where stray - light significantly affected the grxe study ( e.g. , kaneda et al .",
    ". consequently , together with the low / stable background , we are able to accurately measure the energy spectrum and surface brightness of the extended emission using suzaku .",
    "we are particularly interested in the iron k - energy band ( @xmath29 kev ) , since the iron line energies and the widths give us important clues for the grxe emission mechanism .",
    "we use only the xis023 spectrum to study iron lines , since xis1 suffers from high background in this energy band ( figure [ bgd ] , right ) .",
    "the emission line feature is obvious in the xis023 spectrum .",
    "we fitted the data in the 6  10 kev band with an absorbed bremsstrahlung model for the continuum and three gaussian profiles with free intrinsic widths ( energies allowed to be free around 6.4 kev , 6.7 kev and 7.0 kev ) , as well as the neutral @xmath30 line whose energy , intrinsic width ( 1 @xmath31 ) and intensity are fixed at 7.06 kev , 10 ev and at 0.125 times the 6.4 kev line intensity , respectively ( kaastra & mewe 1993 ) .",
    "the fit above 6 kev is hardly affected by the hydrogen column density , which is fixed at the value constrained from the low energy model fitting ( @xmath32 @xmath3 ; see below ) .",
    "we got @xmath33 = 3.9 kev and @xmath34=197.6 with d.o.f.=213 . in figure",
    "[ ironline ] , we show the observed energy spectrum and the best - fit model . in table",
    "[ ironlinetable ] , the best - fit line parameters are given ( errors quoted in this paper correspond to the 90 % confidence limits ) .",
    "we also tried a power - law continuum ( photon - index=3.2 ) instead of the bremsstrahlung , but the line parameters hardly depended on the continuum model used .    .iron line parameters [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]      as explained above , we successfully fitted the energy spectrum in 6  10 kev and 0.4  4 kev separately with a simple power - law continuum and gaussian lines . however , it is not easy to find a model which can fit the observed spectrum in the entire energy range",
    ". therefore , in order to determine the total flux in the direction of the galactic plane in the standard energy band 2  10 kev , we furthermore fit the spectrum in 4  6 kev separately with simple power - law , and sum the contributions from the individual energy bands .",
    "the 2  10 kev flux thus determined is @xmath35 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 deg@xmath7 ( xis0 , 2 and 3 average ) .",
    "also , the 0.5  2 kev flux obtained from the low energy spectral fitting ( previous section ) is @xmath36 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 deg@xmath7 ( xis0 , 2 and 3 average ) , excluding the ovii forbidden line .",
    "note that these fluxes include contribution of point sources dimmer than @xmath25 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 ( 2  10 kev ) , which are not resolved with suzaku .",
    "the chandra fluxes calculated with the same condition are @xmath37 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 deg@xmath7 ( 2  10 kev ) and @xmath38 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 deg@xmath7 ( 0.5  2 kev ) ( ebisawa et al .",
    "the @xmath420 % difference in the 2  10 kev flux is due to systematic calibration uncertainty between chandra and suzaku , which has yet to be understood .",
    "we have observed a typical galactic plane region at @xmath39 (= the chandra ao1 deep field ) with suzaku .",
    "thanks to the superior spectral resolution , the large effective area and the low background of suzaku xis , we obtained so far the best quality spectrum of the grxe .",
    "for the first time , the iron k - line complex was clearly resolved into three individual peaks at 6.4 kev , 6.67 kev and 7.0 kev .",
    "importantly , the line widths are also tightly constrained to be less than @xmath450 ev ( 1 @xmath31 ) .",
    "the central energy of the he - like k@xmath40 line , which is in fact a blend of the resonance , inter - combination and forbidden lines , is a good indicator of the plasma condition ( see koyama et al .",
    "2007b ) . in the case of collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) ,",
    "the centroid is 6.6806.685 kev , depending on plasma densities and different plasma models ( koyama et al .",
    "the peak energy is shifted downward if the plasma is in a non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) state .",
    "using asca sis , kaneda et al .",
    "( 1997 ) claimed to have detected a _",
    "narrow emission line at @xmath41 kev , that is significantly lower than what is expected in the cie case , and suggested that the iron line is from a nei plasma .",
    "chandra observation by ebisawa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) also indicated a similar line center energy @xmath42 kev , if the line feature is fitted with a _",
    "single _ gaussian .",
    "meanwhile , thanks to suzaku s superior sensitivity and energy resolution , we unambiguously detected the two separate lines at 6.41 kev and 6.670 kev , the flux of the former being one - third of that of the latter .",
    "the centroid of the two lines will be at 6.58 kev , and the 7.0 kev line is too weak to be detected with asca and chandra .",
    "hence , we consider that the lower he - like k@xmath40 line energies previously reported by asca and chandra were significantly affected by the presence of the 6.41 kev line , which was unresolved by these instruments .",
    "koyama et al .",
    "( 2007b ) determined the he - like k@xmath40 line energy from the galactic center ( gc ) plasma as @xmath43 kev , which is consistent with the cie plasma model .",
    "we obtained a very close value of @xmath44 kev , which does not show evidence of the nei conditions .",
    "thanks to the brightness of the gc plasma illuminating the entire ccd chip , koyama et al .",
    "( 2007b ) were able to perform the chip - segment dependent charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) correction , which effectively increased the iron line energies by several electron - volts .",
    "we can not apply the same correction , since the ridge emission is not so strong ; however , if we consider the possible upward shift of the line energies due to this effect , our line energy completely agrees with that from the gc and the cie plasma .",
    "the observed h - like / he - like line intensity ratio ( @xmath45 ) is also consistent with that expected for a cie plasma of @xmath33 = 5  8 kev .",
    "earlier , tanaka et al . (",
    "2000 ) reported that , analyzing the asca data of the extended emission in the galactic center region , the iron k - lines are significantly broadened with a width of @xmath46 ev .",
    "they suggested a possibility of the charge exchange process for the origin of the lines , where low - energy cosmic - ray iron ions will undergo charge exchange as they slow down in the interstellar space .",
    "they interpreted the finite line width as due to the bulk motion of the cosmic - ray ions .",
    "tanaka ( 2002 ) pointed out the close similarity of the shape of the grxe spectrum ( at the same direction as the present one ) with that around the galactic center , and considered that the iron lines in the grxe may as well be broadened , while this could not be examined with asca due to insufficient statistics .",
    "the he - like k@xmath40 line energy expected from the charge exchange process is @xmath47 kev ( wargelin et al .",
    "2005 ) , which is not clearly excluded from the present result @xmath44 kev unless the segment - dependent cti correction is applied .",
    "however , our result supports that the he - like and h - like iron lines from the galactic ridge are essentially narrow lines , which is against the line - broadening due to the cosmic - ray bulk motion and charge exchange .",
    "the suzaku observation of the gc region also clearly refuted the broadening of the iron lines , as well as that the he - like k@xmath40 line energy does not agree with that expected from the charge exchange ( koyama et al .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the charge exchange origin is quite unlikely for grxe , as well as gc plasma .",
    "ev is still unclear .",
    "as written in their paper , the observed spectra from eight ccd chips were stacked with reference to the 6.7-kev line peak position , such that the line width after summation was minimized .",
    "one possibility is that the tuning of the energy scales among each other was not sufficient . ]",
    "thus , a cie plasma is the most probable origin of the he - like and h - like iron k@xmath40 lines . by the same token ,",
    "the lower - energy lines from highly ionized ions of other abundant elements are considered to be thermal emission .",
    "however , the thermal structure of the plasma is not simple .",
    "as shown in table 2 , the h - like / he - like line intensity ratio is similar among different elements from mg through ar , and all roughly 0.3  0.5 , and the same is true for fe .",
    "this presumably requires a multi - temperature plasma .",
    "there exist two alternative possibilities to explain the cie plasma emission from the galactic ridge .",
    "the fundamental difference is whether such plasma is genuinely diffuse or gravitationally bound in the stellar sources .",
    "consequently the ultimate questions are the following : ( 1 ) does the superposition of all the point sources reproduce the observed grxe spectrum , in particular , the complex emission line features ? ( 2 ) is the number of such galactic point sources sufficient to explain the total grxe flux ?    as regards the origin of the 6.4 kev line , which is not emitted by the hot plasma but due to fluorescence from cold material , another explanation is required .",
    "based on the diffuse model , valinia et al .",
    "( 2000 ) proposed that interaction between the interstellar medium and cosmic supra / non - thermal electrons is responsible for the 6.4 kev line , as well as for the hard - tail observed above @xmath48 kev ( yamasaki et al .",
    "1997 ; valinia et al .",
    "2000 ) . on the other hand , superposition of numerous , different kinds of point sources may create such complex iron line spectra ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "in fact , quiescent cataclysmic variables are known to emit three iron lines , where the 6.4 kev line is due to reflection from the white - dwarf surfaces ( e.g. , ezuka & ishida 1999 ) .",
    "also , cataclysmic variables often reveal multi - temperature spectra with various emission lines as seen in grxe .      excluding the point sources brighter than @xmath49 ergs s@xmath2@xmath3 ( 2 10 kev ) , we have measured the total flux in the direction of the galactic plane ( including cosmic x - ray background ) as @xmath35 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 deg@xmath7 ( 210 kev ) , which is consistent with the chandra measurement on the same region within 20 % .",
    "currently , only @xmath415 % of the 2  10 kev of the total surface brightness is explained by the point sources ( either galactic or extragalactic ) brighter than @xmath9 ergs s@xmath2@xmath3 ( ebisawa et al .",
    "in 1  7 kev , where galactic point sources are more dominant , @xmath50 % of the total flux is resolved into point sources with interstellar absorption corrected fluxes higher than @xmath51 ergs s@xmath2@xmath3 ( revnivtsev & sazonov 2007 ) .    for comparison",
    ", we estimate the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) flux seen through the galactic plane .",
    "the 2 10 kev cxb flux determined from the high galactic region is @xmath52 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 deg@xmath7 ( moretti et al .",
    "2003 ) , where point sources dimmer than @xmath53 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 are included . in order to compare with our results where point sources brighter than @xmath54 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 are excluded , we subtract the cumulative flux of the sources between @xmath54 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath53 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 using the model extragalactic @xmath55 curve by moretti et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ; thus we obtained the unabsorbed cxb flux @xmath56 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 deg@xmath7 .    the hydrogen column density through the galactic plane is estimated to be @xmath57 @xmath3 in this direction ( ebisawa et al .",
    "2001 ) , which attenuates the background cxb down to @xmath58 % in 2  10 kev , assuming a photon - index of 1.7 .",
    "consequently , @xmath59 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 deg@xmath7 is expected from the background cxb on the galactic plane , which is ultimately resolved into individual agns .",
    "chandra already resolved point - sources down to @xmath60 ergs s@xmath2@xmath3 , whose cumulative flux is @xmath61 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 deg@xmath7 .",
    "therefore , we see that a significant part of the dim hard chandra sources is extragalactic .",
    "in fact , only @xmath420 % of the chandra hard x - ray sources had near - infrared counterparts down to @xmath62 ( hence considered to be galactic ) , whereas almost all the soft x - ray sources had counterparts ( ebisawa et al .",
    "2005 ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we measure the flux of the the galactic ridge x - ray emission as @xmath63 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 deg@xmath7 ( 2  10 kev ) , excluding the galactic and extragalactic sources brighter than @xmath49 ergs s@xmath2@xmath3 and the estimated contribution of dimmer extragalactic sources .",
    "how much fraction of this emission is ultimately resolved into galactic point sources has been a long standing question ( e.g. , worrall & marshall 1983 ; ottmann & schmitt 1992 ; mukai & shiokawa 1992 ; ebisawa et al .",
    "2005 ; revnivtsev et al .",

    "hence , we estimate the grxe emissivity as @xmath64 erg s@xmath2 @xmath65 or @xmath66 erg s@xmath2 pc@xmath67 .",
    "thermal bremsstrahlung emissivity is given as @xmath68 erg @xmath65 s@xmath2 ( zombeck 2007 ) , thus if we assume uniformly distributed hot plasma with @xmath69k , the electron density is @xmath70 @xmath65 , which is extremely tenuous .",
    "the galactic volume corresponding to 1 deg@xmath27 in the direction of @xmath8 is @xmath71 pc@xmath72 .",
    "if the grxe is ultimately resolved into point sources such as cataclysmic variables or active binary stars , @xmath73 sources are expected per deg@xmath27 ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "hence the spatial density of such sources is @xmath74 pc@xmath67 , and the average luminosity is @xmath75 erg s@xmath2 per source .",
    "we estimate volume of the plasma associated with each point source as @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the scaling factor , @xmath78 for active binaries and @xmath79 for cataclysmic variables ( white dwarfs ) . in the case of magnetic cataclysmic variables , which is supposed to be responsible for hard ( @xmath8010 kev ) part of the grxe ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "2006 ) , @xmath77 is expected to be particularly small , since accretion flow is concentrated on the small magnetic pole regions .",
    "again assuming @xmath81k , we obtain @xmath82 @xmath65 .",
    "thus , we see that the grxe plasma densities expected for the diffuse case and the point source case are many orders of magnitude different , which is distinguishable from plasma diagnostics . in near future ,",

    "<S> we have observed a typical galactic plane field at @xmath0 with suzaku for 100 ksec to carry out a precise spectral study of the galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) . </S>",
    "<S> the field is known to be devoid of x - ray point sources brighter than @xmath1ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 ( 210 kev ) , and already deeply observed with chandra . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the low and stable background and high spectral resolution of suzaku , we were able to resolve , for the first time , three _ </S>",
    "<S> narrow _ iron k - emission lines from low - ionized ( 6.41 kev ) , helium - like ( 6.67 kev ) , and hydrogenic ions ( 7.00 kev ) in the grxe spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> these line features constrain the grxe emission mechanisms : the cosmic - ray ion charge exchange model or the non - equilibrium ionization plasma model are unlikely , since they require either broad emission lines or lines at intermediate ionization states . </S>",
    "<S> collisional ionization equilibrium plasma is the likely origin for the 6.67 kev and 7.00 kev lines , while origin of the 6.41 kev line , which is due to fluorescence from cold material , is not elucidated . </S>",
    "<S> low non - x - ray background and little stray - light contamination of suzaku allowed us to precisely measure the absolute x - ray surface brightness in the direction of the galactic plane . excluding the point sources brighter than @xmath42 @xmath5 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 ( 210 kev ) , the total surface brightness on the galactic plane is @xmath46.1 @xmath6 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 deg@xmath7 ( 210 kev ) , including the contribution of the cosmic x - ray background that is estimated to be @xmath41.3@xmath6 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 deg@xmath7 . </S>"
