    "in recent years , online social networking sites ( osns ) have become an increasingly central medium for information diffusion . in osns , users can generate their own content , but also discover information generated by their social contacts and re - share it to their own contacts .",
    "importantly , an information can be re - shared multiple times , and the resulting multiplicative mechanism may lead to cascades over a large number of people , possibly even reaching regions of the social graph distant from the original post @xcite .",
    "such cascades have been identified in a variety of osns , including facebook and twitter @xcite .",
    "a growing body of research has improved our understanding of information cascades , from the design of accurate theoretical models for diffusion @xcite , to the empirical study of the structural properties of cascades @xcite and of their interplay with the structure of the underlying topology @xcite . from a practical point of view",
    ", a crucial question is to predict the future evolution of an information cascade , based on observations made during its early stage .",
    "the most simple way to formulate this problem is to predict the final size of the information cascade , that is the total number of direct and indirect re - shares received by a given post .",
    "this prediction problem has important applications for the good - functioning of osns , for instance to rank content and improve the presentation of information to often overflowed users , and for media campaign management . in a machine learning framework , this problem can be solved as a classification task , where an exhaustive set of features , including semantic , structural and temporal information , are fed into standard classification methods @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach consists in building realistic , yet simple and principled , models of information diffusion , and fitting their parameters on empirical data @xcite .",
    "this modeling approach has the advantage of improving our understanding of the mechanisms driving diffusion , and of testing the predictive power of information diffusion models .    *",
    "present work : * in this paper , we extend the classical problem of cascade size prediction and aim at predicting how the cascade size evolves in time . in practice , we focus on twitter and on the number of retweets of an original tweet , but our method is general and can be applied to any type of osn . our problem is the following : given a time series of retweets during a window of observation , being able to predict the time evolution of the frequency at which retweets will appear in the future , at different temporal resolutions .",
    "we are thus interested in predicting not only a number , the final size of the cascade , but a curve , how popularity will evolve in time , after a window of observation .",
    "to do so , we adopt a modeling perspective and see the time series as a time - dependent hawkes process , tideh , which generalizes a classical model for self - exciting point processes .",
    "hawkes process differ from memoryless poisson processes as the future rate of activity is boosted by the occurrence of previous events @xcite .",
    "they can themselves be seen as generalizations of epidemiological models and branching processes @xcite , where an additional ingredient is incorporated , a memory kernel determining the time between a cause , e.g. a tweet , and its effect , a retweet .",
    "hawkes processes have been adopted in a wide range of applications , including information diffusion in osns @xcite , where their multiplicative nature naturally translates the fact that a new re - share exposes new followers and may thus provoke new re - shares in the future . here , we additionally make the hawkes process time - dependent by allowing the model parameter to vary daily .",
    "our methodology is set up as follows : for a tweet of interest , we observe its retweet sequence @xmath0 up to time @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the @xmath3-th retweeted time , @xmath4 is the number of followers of the @xmath3-th retweeting person , @xmath5 is the posted time of the original tweet , @xmath6 is the number of followers of the tweeting person , and @xmath7 is the duration of the observation .",
    "we first fit the parameters of tideh based on time series of retweets and information on the number of followers .",
    "we then predict retweet activity , defined as the number of retweets in the @xmath8-th bin @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the bin width that represents the time resolution of the prediction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schem_predict ] ) .",
    "let us note here that our prediction task generalizes the task of predicting the total number of retweets , as the latter is recovered either for large values of @xmath10 or by summing all of the future values of retweet activity .",
    "the prediction of future events is performed by solving numerically a self - consistent integral equation of the model during the prediction period .",
    "as we will see , tideh presents a series of advantages over existing approaches , as it significantly improves the accuracy of predictions and that it provides a systematic , mathematically sound , framework to predict temporal variations of re - shares in osns .",
    "determines the temporal resolution of the analysis . b. prediction problem .",
    "we aim to predict the future retweet activity from observed retweet times and number of followers up to time @xmath11",
    ". in general , two different types of binning , @xmath12 and @xmath10 , can be used for the estimation of model parameters and for the prediction of future events.,width=264 ]    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section 2 surveys the related work . in section 3 , we describe the data - set , describe tideh , and provide evidence for the circadian dependence of the model parameter .",
    "we then devise an optimization method for parameter estimation and test it on artificial data . in section 4 , we present our procedure to predict the future profiles of retweet activity and compare the accuracy of different versions of tideh . in section 5 ,",
    "we thoroughly evaluate our method on empirical data and compare its performance with state - of - the - art approaches . in section 6",
    ", we conclude and discuss future research directions .",
    "the study of information cascades in osns is an active field of research @xcite .",
    "many papers have analyzed and described the temporal and structural properties of empirical information cascades @xcite . in parallel ,",
    "theoretical works have considered the design of theoretical models of cascade dynamics in networks @xcite .",
    "our work is at the interface between these approaches , as the prediction of the future course of a cascade is performed through a properly calibrated information diffusion model .",
    "the problem of cascade prediction is generally defined to estimate the final size of a cascade , or equivalently the total popularity of an original post .",
    "broadly speaking , two types of methods have been developed to solve this problem .",
    "on the one hand , machine learning methods consist in collecting an exhaustive list of potentially relevant features for each cascade , including semantic content , meta - information , structural and temporal features . learning or statistical methods",
    "are then applied in order to classify the cascades and predict their future size . following the seminal observation that popularity on early days and later ones",
    "are high log - linear correlated @xcite , more recent works focusing on twitter include @xcite , where learning techniques are shown to achieve similar performance to humans , but also @xcite showing that the number of username mentions helps predicting the speed and shape of retweet dynamics . in the case of re - shares on facebook , let us also mention @xcite where the authors observe that temporal and structural features of cascades are key predictors for their growth .",
    "known drawbacks of this family of methods include a high sensitivity to the quality of the features , the requirement of an extensive training , and thus a limited applicability in real - time online settings @xcite .",
    "a second type of predictive methods aims at calibrating models of information diffusion on time series of events during a window of observation , possibly by incorporating additional social network information .",
    "two important ingredients of the models are the instantaneous character of events in osns , which are thus so - called  point processes \" in the mathematical literature , and the multiplicative nature of the diffusion , as new events tend to trigger new ones .",
    "for these reasons , several works have developed models based on self - exciting point processes and , in particular , hawkes processes .",
    "a major distinction between our model and existing ones @xcite is its time - dependence as we take into account circadian rhythms of online popularity and aging of information .",
    "importantly , the infectiousness of the original tweet naturally depends on its posting time , in agreement with observations that it is an intuitive predictor for popularity @xcite , and this effect is also present for later retweets .",
    "our model can be seen as a time - dependent extension of seismic @xcite , as our model also incorporates a partial information of the network structure , but with two additional differences .",
    "first , our goal is to predict the time evolution of the number of retweets in the future , and not simply the total number of retweets .",
    "as we show below , the incorporation of circadian patterns is particularly important to improve accuracy in this context .",
    "second , we develop a framework for predicting future activity that is mathematically consistent with the modeling .",
    "our model is also related to the time - dependent poisson process model @xcite , which we compare to tideh below , and to spikem @xcite , which incorporates daily cycles and a finite population ensuring an asymptotic decay of the propagation , but differs from our approach by its deterministic and descriptive character .",
    "these two models also have the drawback of neglecting the effect of social network topology on information cascade , despite its important impact in spreading processes .    beyond these works on information diffusion , it is important to emphasize here that hawkes processes have been applied in a variety of settings in order to describe and to predict univariate or multivariate data .",
    "originally defined to describe earthquake dynamics @xcite , where a power - law memory kernel was first introduced @xcite , it was for instance applied to predict where and when aftershocks would occur @xcite . in finance , and in particular high frequency finance @xcite , estimations of the model parameters allow to quantify if price changes are dominated by endogenous feedback processes , as opposed to exogenous news @xcite .",
    "similar applications have also been developed to model popularity of online content , in particular in youtube @xcite , by estimating the different types of response after endogenous and exogenous bursts of activity . in social dynamics , @xcite showed that the model can help reproduce empirical features observed in conversation event sequences , and @xcite applied it in order to predict criminal events . in scientometrics , citation dynamics have been also modeled by modified hawkes models @xcite , and future citations of a given paper predicted by reinforced poisson process @xcite . finally , let us also note that hawkes processes have also triggered theoretical research associated to the non - markovian nature of their dynamics , and its impact on spreading times @xcite .",
    "we analyzed 166,076 tweets on twitter from october 7 to november 7 , 2011 , which was used in a previous study  @xcite and available in http://snap.stanford.edu / seismic/. for each tweet , the dataset includes tweet i d , posting time , time of retweets , and the number of followers of users for the original tweet and later retweets .",
    "the retweet times are recorded up to 7 days ( 168 hours ) from the original post for each tweet .",
    "note that the data contains some minimal information about the network structure ( the number of followers ) , as it is easily available through the twitter api , but the presence of connections between users in the twitter network is not known .",
    "we focus on a subset of popular tweets ( 738 tweets ) that have at least 2,000 retweets in order to calibrate our model and to evaluate the performance of our predictions .",
    "we develop a time - dependent hawkes process ( tideh ) for predicting retweet activity , and extending the classical stationary hawkes process  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : td_hawkes ] ) .",
    "the probability for getting a retweet in a small time interval @xmath13 $ ] is described as @xmath14 \\right)= \\lambda(t ) \\delta t ,   \\label{eq : poisson}\\ ] ] where the time - dependent rate depends on previous events as @xmath15 and where @xmath16 is the infectious rate , @xmath2 is the time of @xmath3-th retweet .",
    "following @xcite , we also incorporate the number @xmath4 of followers of the @xmath3-th retweeting person . by doing so",
    ", the model essentially generates a branching process for the diffusion , and gives more importance to highly connected nodes .",
    "this step is akin to tree - like and heterogeneous mean - field approximations popular to simplify the theoretical study of epidemic spreading on networks @xcite .",
    "the memory kernel @xmath17 is a probability distribution for the reaction time of a follower , that is the time interval between a tweet by the followee and its retweet by the follower .",
    "this distribution has been shown to be heavily tailed in a variety of social networks @xcite , and it is fitted to the empirical data by the function @xmath18 the parameters were set to @xmath19 ( /seconds ) , @xmath20 seconds , and @xmath21 @xcite . as we show in the following section , @xmath16 is observed to decrease to zero for sufficiently long times , which ensures that the predicted number of retweets does not diverge .",

    "however , our choice is motivated by its simplicity and the window size ( @xmath29 ) is set to 4 hours . examples of the estimated infectious rate from a retweet sequence are shown in figure  [ fig : ex_est_pt ] .          infectious rates @xmath16 from a retweet sequence ( fig .  [ fig : ex_est_pt ] ) clearly show two properties , a circadian cycles and a slow decay .",
    "the decay is expected due to the inevitable aging of information , whose life - cycle is known to be short in microblogging systems , but also to the decreasing number of potentially interested followers , as the cascade progresses .",
    "the oscillations are expected for cascades that remain geographically localized , within a limited number of time zones , such that daily cycles of human activity naturally translate into cycles of retweet activity .",

    "let us now examine how the choice of fitting procedure for the infectious rate , described in subsection [ sec : pred_fit_pt ] , impacts the prediction performance .",

    "as a second step , let us consider the impact of the window size @xmath10 on prediction performance . figure  [ fig : comp_pred_dt ] shows a similar pattern as above , with tideh the best predictor over all time scales , from precise ( 1 hour ) to coarse ( 1 day ) predictions , followed by rpp , lr - n , and lr . in general , the dependency of the error on the window size is weak , and the error slightly decreases when the window size is increased , possibly because the observation time is not sufficient to learn the retweets dynamics with a greater accuracy and/or the retweet dynamics has characteristic times larger than 1 day .    finally , we estimate the prediction performance of tideh for a standard objective function , the final number of retweets .",
    "in addition to the three baseline method , we also compare its performance with the fourth baseline , seismic .",
    "figure  [ fig : comp_final ] shows that tideh provides again the most accurate predictions for the final number of retweets . in terms of the mean and median error",
    ", we observe an improvement of around 30 % over the two runners up ( seismic and rpp ) .    .",
    "lr : linear regression , lr - n : linear regression with the number of followers , rpp : reinforcement poisson process , tideh : proposed model .",
    "we predicted the retweet activity up to @xmath64 hours from the original post with the window size @xmath113 hours.,width=264 ]    .",
    "prediction performance of the best two methods ( rpp and tideh ) were shown.,width=264 ]    .",
    "the abbreviations of the methods are the same as fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_pred_t ] .",
    "the observation time @xmath7 is fixed to 6 hours.,width=264 ]",
    "in this work , we have introduced tideh , a framework based on self - exciting point processes to predict the future time evolution of the popularity of a tweet .",
    "the method is based on the calibration of a model for information diffusion in social networks , which incorporates network information , circadian rhythms of online activity and aging of information . by doing so",
    ", the model provides a description based on absolute times , that is the time of the day , and relative time , that is the time since the previous triggering event , with a yet small number of parameters .",
    "as compared to previous models , our approach also has the advantage of mathematical consistency , as the modeling and the prediction tasks are performed in the same framework , and leads to a systematic improvement of accuracy in a wide range of time scales .",
    "interestingly , our model also outperforms state - of - the - art methods to estimate the final number of retweets of a tweet , which emphasizes the importance of an appropriate modeling to solve prediction task .    here",
    ", we have focused on the popular tweets that have more than 2,000 retweets , but the majority of information cascades on social networks are significantly shorter",
    ". it would be interesting to develop a parameter optimization technique for shorter data to overcome the limitation .",
    "potential extensions of our work include a more detailed circadian activity by enriching the proposed model with higher harmonics and incorporating additional network information , such as correlations between number of followees and number of followers .",
    "this study was supported by jsps kakenhi grant number 25870915 to rk , and arc and the belgian network dysco ( dynamical systems , control , and optimismtion ) , funded by the interuniversity attraction poles programme to rl .",
    "this work is also the fruit of a bilateral joint research projects between jsps , japan , and f.r.s .- fnrs , belgium .",
    "we thank takaaki aoki for stimulating discussions and anonymous reviewers for helpful comments ."
