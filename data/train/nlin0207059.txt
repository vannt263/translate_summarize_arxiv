    "one of the most interesting features of surface reactions is that in a large number of cases produce pattern formation , structures with some well  defined length scale , sometimes with symmetries and temporal behavior , such as oscillations , traveling waves , spirals , turing patterns , etc @xcite .",
    "a usual approach to study this pattern formation is reaction  diffusion ( rd ) equations @xcite , which simulate the dynamic behavior of chemical reactions on surfaces .",
    "however , these partial differential equations give only approximate solutions and in several cases completely wrong results , because they are based on the local mean field approximation , meaning well  mixed reactants at microscopic level , ignoring all the correlation terms between reactants locally , fluctuations and lateral interactions in the adsorbate @xcite .",
    "the rd equations describe the coverage which are macroscopic continuum variables which neglect the discrete structure of matter , and do not describe the actual chemical process underlying pattern formation .",
    "in fact from experimental studies @xcite it is known that to model correctly , a modified kinetic has to be assumed different from the prescribed for rd .    based in some general assumptions of the physics processes involved , an esencial master equation can be derived that completely describes the microscopic dynamic of the system @xcite . an exact method to solve this master equation",
    "is the monte carlo ( mc ) method @xcite . in a monte carlo method a sequence of discrete events ( reactions , including diffusion )",
    "is generated on a 2d lattice which represents the surface sites .",
    "these events are generated in general in a random way , looking for possible enabled reactions between nearest neighbors on the lattice , and doing the reactions with some probability in correspondence with some defined reaction rates .    to compare mc simulations with experimental pattern formation",
    "it is necessary to fill the gap between the length scale of the individual particles and the diffusion length .",
    "the regime where spatio  temporal patterns usually occurs , from @xmath6 m to mm scales , is orders of magnitude larger than the nm scale of individual particles .",
    "however , some new experiments @xcite show that the fast kinetics processes are typically accompanied by the appearance of nanostructures .",
    "only microscopic simulations could deal with this two  scales behavior .",
    "however this regime implies lattices sizes above @xmath7 and very large values for the diffusion rates to produce agreement with the experimental observed scales on pattern formation . this would be a very large and slow simulation , due to the huge number of particles involved and the fast diffusion rates which means that most of the simulation time is spend doing diffusion of particles instead of chemical reactions .",
    "fortunately , we do not need to simulate every time such a macroscopic system or experimental diffusion rates .",
    "we only need to find scaling laws for lengths and diffusion coefficients , i.e from nm scale to @xmath6 m or mm scale , and from microscopic to real time .",
    "this is the possibility which we explore in this paper by using large simulations within parallel computers .",
    "although only mc simulations provides solutions to the exact master equations for the surface reactions , they are not suitable for efficient parallelization due to the random selection of lattice sites used . however , there is another important approach to simulate discrete events on lattices , the cellular automata ( ca ) @xcite .",
    "this approach is fully parallel in the sense that all the lattice sites can be updated simultaneously .",
    "this has the advantages that fewer random numbers are required , only those for the reaction probabilities ( ca codes are faster than mc ) , and the global updating is easier to implement in a parallel code .    under some well  defined conditions a ca is equivalent to a mc simulation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and section ii ) .",
    "then a ca could be used as a mc simulation and its parallelization will provide with the required scaling laws . in this paper",
    "we present for first time an attempt to provide a tool to get these scaling laws .",
    "the fact that ca are ideal simulation methods for parallelization is shown in a recent special issue dedicated to ca in _",

    "in particular a quite interesting paper by j.r .",
    "weimar @xcite presents an object oriented parallel ca , also based in ref .",
    "@xcite , and explores the possibility of divide the surface in regions to be simulated by rd or ca according to the level of detail required .    in this paper we will describe in detail the implementation of the parallel version of a ca simulating chemical reactions on surfaces , but the ideas discussed here are also applicable to more general ca simulations . in section",
    "ii we will describe briefly the cellular automata method . in section iii",
    "we explain the key points to implement the parallelization of the algorithm . in section",
    "iv we will present results of the application of the parallel algorithm to the a@xmath3b@xmath4 model , and to a realistic model of oxidation of co on pt@xmath5 . finally in section v we will draw some conclusion .",
    "a cellular automaton ( ca ) is a regular array of cells .",
    "each cell can be in one of a set of possible states .",
    "the ca evolves in time in discrete steps by changing the states of all cells simultaneously .",
    "the next state which a cell will take is based on the previous state of the cell and the states of some neighboring cells .",
    "a ca is defined by providing prescriptions for the lattice , the set of states , the neighbors , and the transition rules @xcite .",
    "the idea of ca deserves by itself a lot of study , since in general the evolution of a ca can not be predicted other than by executing it .",
    "additionally the amount of possible cas is quite large .",
    "for instance , in the simplest one  dimensional case , with two states and two neighbors , there are @xmath8 possible ca .",
    "our ca uses the standard square two  dimensional lattice of size @xmath9 .",
    "the states of each cell represent occupation with some kind of particle .",
    "the margolus neighborhood @xcite is used instead of the common von neumann neighborhood .",
    "both definitions of neighborhood are shown in fig.[margolus ] . in order to obey the ca laws in von neumann neighborhood ,",
    "it is necessary @xcite disobey the laws of stoichiometry because one particle could participate in more than one reactive pair .",
    "similar problems arise with the diffusion of particles @xcite .",
    "the use of a margolus neighborhood overcomes these difficulties @xcite . using the value of the chemical rates we set up some probabilistic transition rules to change the states of the cells inside each margolus block .",

    "the lines joining points show the nearest neighbor couples in each case .",
    ", width=226 ]    the margolus blocks , fig.[margolus ] , are used in the following way .",
    "the blocks are periodically repeated to build up a tiled mask over the whole lattice , considering periodic boundary conditions . in this way",
    "there are four possible tilings as shown in fig.[tiling ] .",
    "only neighbor sites belonging to the same block can react , so all the blocks can be accessed in parallel .",
    "inside each block a monte carlo update is done . after a full lattice update the whole procedure starts over again using another of the four possible tilings .",
    "the dynamics is not confined to blocks , because the boundary between blocks is changing from one global sweep to the next .",
    "for the four tilings shown in fig.[tiling ] , we chose randomly one of the four possible sequences of tilings : ( @xmath10,@xmath11,@xmath12,@xmath13 ) , ( @xmath11,@xmath12,@xmath13,@xmath10 ) , ( @xmath12,@xmath13,@xmath10,@xmath11 ) , and ( @xmath13,@xmath10,@xmath11,@xmath12 ) .",

    "the arrows show the sequence order .",
    "the lines joining points illustrate the mc updating of pairs inside blocks .",
    ", width=302 ]    a schematic description of the steps to implement this ca is given at the following :    * choose randomly one of the four possible sequences of tilings : ( @xmath10,@xmath11,@xmath12,@xmath13 ) , ( @xmath11,@xmath12,@xmath13,@xmath10 ) , ( @xmath12,@xmath13,@xmath10,@xmath11 ) , ( @xmath13,@xmath10,@xmath11,@xmath12 ) .",
    "* choose consecutive tilings from the sequence of step 1 .",
    "* sweep over all the blocks and in each block make a single monte carlo update : * * choose randomly one pair of neighbors . *",
    "* choose a reaction @xmath14 from the set of all the possible reactions with a probability proportional to the reaction rate @xmath15 .",
    "* * check if the reaction chosen in step 3.2 is possible on the sites chosen in step 3.1 .",
    "if it is possible do the reaction , otherwise do nothing .",
    "* increase the time by @xmath16 , and return to step 2 until the sequence of tilings is completed . * return to step 1 .",
    "the updating scheme inside each block is the same as in the dynamic monte carlo algorithm called random selection method @xcite .",
    "consequently , the time increment is the same as one monte carlo step ( mcs ) @xcite : @xmath17 where the sum in the denominator corresponds to the sum of all the possible reaction rates .",
    "there is a large number of possible ca prescriptions which could try to reproduce a mc simulation of chemical reactions on surfaces .",
    "in fact , an extensive study made by j.  mai @xcite shows that in general it is difficult produce good cas reproducing chemical reactions and diffusion .",
    "however , in a recent paper kortlke @xcite studies under which conditions a ca could reproduce adequately a mc simulation of chemical reactions on surfaces .",
    "he found that the main requirement is using large diffusion coefficients .",
    "it is required some sort of compromise between mc and ca : it is necessary use a regular array of blocks as in ca , and a mc update scheme has to be used inside each block .",
    "the ca which we use here is a small modification of that used by kortlke originally @xcite .",
    "we use blocks of @xmath13sites ( margolus blocks ) instead of @xmath11sites ( hantels blocks ) .",
    "the main advantage of using this @xmath13sites instead of @xmath11sites is that reduces the level of ca noise ( see @xcite ) inside each block .",
    "this ca noise is the difference between the diffusion simulated with ca and the correct diffusion simulated with mc .",
    "in fact using larger blocks the noise will be smaller .",
    "additionally we present here a full realization of the ca parallel computing idea by implementing this in a parallel code as is shown in the next section .",
    "this is the main reason for use ca instead mc as a solution for large  time and large  sizes simulations .",
    "otherwise the only use of ca instead mc in a serial simulation does not speed up the simulation substantially , in the best cases only @xmath18@xmath19 .",
    "this means that the implementation of an efficient ca is very important .    despite that we have to accept that our ca is an approximation to exact mc microscopic simulations , we known when the approximation is good and we can always check that the ca is reproducing the mc results . in this way we can think about the ca as the mc realization of the exact master equation for the chemical processes , getting in this way , the possibility of obtain the scaling laws mentioned at the introduction for these physical systems",
    "in this paper we do not discus the problem of quality of the ca approximation to the mc realization .",
    "this was done in @xcite and we have made for our modified ca a similar study with similar results .",
    "the fact that blocks can be updated without referring to other blocks allows us to do ca as a parallel algorithm , because the whole set of blocks can be updated at the same time .",
    "this is the subject of the next section .",
    "the aim of the parallelization of any code is to distribute the whole simulation over several computer processors , also called nodes .",
    "we define @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the computer time used by @xmath2processors to complete a simulation .",
    "the optimum result is that this multiplies the speed of the simulation with the number of nodes , @xmath22 .",
    "however , the usual result of parallelize a code is not the optimum . the key point to achieve a good speed up",
    "is that the time spent by each node sending and receiving information from / to the other nodes is small in comparison with the time consumed doing computing in each node .    in order to distribute the work , we use here a geometrical division as usual @xcite in spatial extended systems ,",
    "i.e. , the full lattice is divide in sublattices of equal area .",
    "the time spent sending data is proportional to the length of the borders , @xmath23 , and the time doing computing is proportional to the system size @xmath24 .",
    "we divide the lattice in strips as is shown in fig.[strips ] . considering the global periodic boundary conditions , each node has periodicity in one direction and in the other directions has to share information with only two neighbor nodes .",
    "another possibility is divide the lattice in squares .",
    "this choice is less convenient .",
    "each node has to share information with 4 nodes instead 2 , and it is only possible to use a perfect square number of nodes @xmath25 . using the strips sublattices requires sending a factor @xmath26 less data than using the square sublattices @xcite , provided to have @xmath27 .",
    "distribution of the lattice in strips sublattices for computing in each node .",
    "division for each tiling shown in fig.[tiling ] .",
    ", width=302 ]    note that due to the periodicity in the vertical direction inside each node , it is not necessary to interchange border information between nodes when we pass from the tiling @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "it is only necessary when we pass from @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this reduces in half the amount of communication data . from fig.[strips ] we see the direction in which the first column of data in each sublattice has to be be sent and received in each node . in the change of tilings @xmath30",
    "the data goes from left to right and in @xmath31 from right to left . instead of shifting the data of each node horizontally we use the first column for sending to or receiving from other nodes .",
    "as a consequence , and to get interaction between sites in the same block , we consider the first column neighbor of the last one .",
    "for this blocking ca , where the reactions are confined inside the blocks , this produces an effective periodicity in the horizontal direction .",
    "this extra periodic boundary condition inside each sublattice , makes the final parallel code very similar to a full lattice implementation .",
    "we use the spmd ( single program , multiple data ) model to implement the parallel simulation , in which every node executes the same code using different sublattice .",
    "also , we use a main node , called node zero , dedicated additionally to distribute and collect the global information needed for the input / output of the simulation and other global computing required .",
