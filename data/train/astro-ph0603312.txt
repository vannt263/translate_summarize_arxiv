    "however , the ratio between the 0.42.7  kev and 4.28.0  kev bands is @xmath10 , providing marginal ( @xmath02@xmath5 ) evidence for the presence of enhanced soft variability .",
    "note also that there _ is _ evidence for enhanced soft variability during observation  882 : the _ difference _ between the 0.42.7  kev and 4.28.0  kev variances is @xmath11 , which is significant at the @xmath02.5@xmath5 level .",
    "we also wished to compare the _",

    "we subdivided the _",
    "xmm - newton _ light curve into 6 segments , each with a duration of @xmath015  ks , and selected the same energy bands that we used for the _ chandra _ data .",
    "the mean excess variances from the _ xmm - newton _ data are listed in table  [ tab : snxs ] , and the variances from both the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations are plotted in fig .",

    "this is useful because the excess - variance analysis is not sensitive to the presence of phase differences between the variations in the different energy bands .",

    "these fits were satisfactory for visit  2 and observation  882 .",
    "the fit for visit  1 , however , was poor ( @xmath14 ) , revealing the presence of scatter about the mean relation , with a significance of 98.4  % .",
    "the mean relations in fig .  [ fig : visit1_2_882_softvhard ] are all consistent with passing through the origin , so there is no significant softening of the spectrum with increasing flux .    in fig .",

    "[ fig : visit1_all ] .",
    "these deviations can be investigated further by resolving the data into narrower energy bands .",
    "we thus defined hard color to be the ratio between the 2.74.2  kev and 4.28.0  kev intensities , while soft color is the ratio between the 0.42.7  kev and 4.28.0  kev intensities .",
    "we perfomed chi - squared tests and found that both the hard and soft colors are consistent with being constant over the duration of visit  1 , and the relationship between these colors is consistent with poisson noise .",
    "the low signal - to - noise ratio of the data thus limits our ability to examine the spectral deviations in detail .    between visit  1 and visit  2",
    "the gradient of the linear relation between the 0.42.7  kev and 4.28.0  kev counting rates ( 1000  s time resolution ) exhibits a significant decrease , from @xmath17 during visit  1 to @xmath18 during visit  2 . between these observations , then , the soft - band intensity has been scaled down relative to that in the hard band .",

    "cross - correlation functions ( ccfs ) were calculated for each of the _ chandra _ observations using a time resolution of 600  s. we used the methods described in   [ sec : uv ] and the analysis was performed on two pairs of energy bands : 0.43.4  kev and 3.48.0  kev , and 0.42.7  kev and 4.28.0  kev .",
    "no significant lags were found , nor did we find any clear asymmetries in the ccfs .",

    "we followed the prescription of @xcite to search for possible periodicities . for visit  1 ,",
    "the power spectrum was divided into two frequency ranges , above and below 10@xmath22  hz ( the poisson noise appears to dominate the power spectrum at frequencies higher than this ) , so that the power - law continuum could be modeled adequately in logarithm - logarithm space using a linear function .",
    "the lower - frequency part of the visit  1 power spectrum had a slope of @xmath23 , and the higher - frequency part was consistent with white noise .",
    "the power was calculated at a total of 1464 frequencies over the entire frequency range so we adopted this as the `` number - of - trials . ''",
    "the most significant peak in visit  1 was found at a frequency of @xmath24  hz , corresponding to a period of 341  s , with a significance of 99.0  % ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : visit1_pow ] ) .",
    "there is no evidence for any signal power in the adjacent frequency bins , so any periodicity , if actually present , would probably have a quality factor ( @xmath25 ) of greater than @xmath090 .",

    "assuming the division to be located at 10@xmath26  hz and 10@xmath27  hz ( i.e. , the peak is on top of the flicker noise component ) yielded significance levels of 99.3  % and 98.5  % , respectively .",
    "we also examined visit  2 and the _ xmm - newton _ data in a similar fashion to visit  1 and found no evidence for a periodicity .",
    "we also re - analyzed observation  882 to compare the methods we have used here with the analysis of @xcite .",

    "the significance of the peak in this case was 95.0  % , in agreement with @xcite , and the frequency of the peak corresponds to a period of 390  s. ( note that @xcite interpolated between fourier frequencies and located the peak at 396  s. )",
    "the _ hst / stis _ light curve at 1350  , with a time resolution of 200  s , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : uv_5302 ]  ( top ) .",
    "we have cross - correlated this light curve with the 0.48.0  kev light curve binned to 300  s , shown in fig .",

    "we used two cross - correlation methods , one being the interpolated cross - correlation function ( iccf ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and the other being the z - transform discrete correlation function ( zdcf ) of @xcite , which is an improvement of the discrete correlation function ( dcf ; * ? ? ?",
    "the results of the cross - correlations are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : uvx_ccf ] , in which we show lags that are symmetrical about zero and for which there are at least 20  lags for each bin in the zdcf .",
    "the two different methods are in very good agreement for these data .    to calculate the uncertainties in the cross - correlation lag determination we used the model - independent fr / rss monte carlo method of @xcite .",
    "in this method , each monte carlo simulation is composed of two parts .",
    "the first is a `` random subset selection '' ( rss ) procedure which consists of randomly drawing , with replacement , from a light curve of @xmath30 points a new sample of @xmath30 points . after the @xmath30 points",
    "are selected , the redundant selections are removed from the sample such that the temporal order of the remaining points is preserved .",
    "this procedure reduces the number of points in each light curve by a factor of @xmath31 and accounts for the effect that individual data points have on the cross - correlation .",
    "the second part is `` flux randomization '' ( fr ) , in which the observed fluxes are altered by random gaussian deviates scaled to the uncertainty ascribed to each point .",
    "this procedure simulates the effect of measurement uncertainties .",
    "the two resampled and altered time series are cross - correlated using the iccf method and the centroid of the ccf is computed .",
    "we used @xmath32 monte carlo realizations to build up a cross - correlation centroid distribution ( cccd ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the mean of the distribution is taken to be the time lag and the uncertainty is determined as the range that contains 68  % of the monte carlo realizations in the cccd and thus would correspond to 1@xmath5 uncertainties for a normal distribution .",
    "we find the time lag between the uv and x - ray light curves to be @xmath33  s , which is clearly consistent with zero time lag , with a 95  % upper limit of roughly @xmath191  hour .      while the x - ray ",
    "uv correlation appears to be significant , an apparently strong correlation could be the result of a chance alignment of two uncorrelated `` flicker - noise '' or `` red - noise '' light curves .",
    "if the power spectrum of a light curve exhibits either flicker - noise or red - noise , then a correlation will exist between points that are nearby in time .",
    "consequently , the _ effective _ number of independent points in each light curve is less than the actual number of points .",
    "therefore , in the case that the two light curves are uncorrelated , the probability of exceeding a certain correlation coefficient is greater than in the case of comparing two light curves that originate from a `` white - noise '' process .    to test",
    "whether we have observed a significant correlation , we simulated x - ray light curves and cross - correlated them against the observed uv light curve .",
    "the power spectrum of the visit  2 0.48.0  kev light curve ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : uv_5302 ]  bottom ) had a power - law index of @xmath34 , and we used this value for the underlying mean power spectrum .",
    "we initially used the method of @xcite to simulate linear light curves .",
    "however , it was not possible to reproduce the observed fractional variance unless negative counting rates were permitted . therefore , following @xcite , we performed an exponential transformation on the linear light curves .",
    "we were thus able to simulate light curves having the required power - law index and variance , while also maintaining positive counting rates .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the exponential transformation slightly alters the slope of the power spectrum .",
    "we adopted a method of trial - and - error to generate power spectra having the required mean power - law index .",
    "note also that an exponential transform is more appropriate than using a linear model because the transformed light curves contain the so - called `` rms - flux '' correlation , which has been observed in ngc  4395 @xcite .    for each synthesized x - ray light curve we calculated the zdcf and found the largest correlation coefficient in the range of lags shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : uvx_ccf ] .",
    "we found that only 50 of the 10000 simulations had a coefficient larger than that observed , which corresponds to a detection significance of 99.5  % .",
    "it is possible that the true , underlying power spectrum has a steeper index than the best - fitting value of 0.86 , so this significance level may be overestimated .",
    "if we adopt instead a value of 1.10 , which is 2@xmath5 higher than the best - fitting value , then the significance is reduced to 99.4  % .",
    "alternatively , the significance is increased to 99.8  % if we use a flatter slope of @xmath35 .",

    "an examination of the relationship between the 0.43.4  kev and 3.48.0  kev intensities revealed erratic , short - term ( timescale @xmath01000  s ) spectral variations during visit  1 , which are seen as deviations from the mean relation between the soft - band and hard - band intensities . during visit  2 , the relationship between the 0.42.7  kev and 4.28.0  kev intensities was flatter than in the other observations ( fig .",

    "the object reached higher intensities compared to visit  1 and visit  2 .",
    "simultaneous uv observations were conducted during part of the second _ chandra _ observation .",
    "we detected a zero - lag correlation between the x - ray and uv fluxes with a significance of @xmath099.5  % .",
    "the upper limit on any lag between the two light curves is roughly @xmath191  hour .",

    "the 210  kev flux during the _ xmm - newton _ observation was @xmath51  erg  @xmath37  s@xmath4 .",
    "our variability analysis suggests , then , that the short - term ( @xmath4715  ks ) variability is significantly softer when the overall flux level is higher .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : xmm_softvhard ] we show the relationship between the 0.43.4  kev and 3.48.0  kev counting rates during the _ xmm - newton _ observation , with a time resolution of 1000  s. while a detailed analysis of the _ xmm - newton _ data is beyond the scope of this paper , fig .",
    "[ fig : xmm_softvhard ] shows clearly that the softness increases as the flux increases . during the _ chandra _ observations ,",
    "ngc  4395 occupied only the lower part of this track ( i.e. , below the dashed line ) , with no excursions to the upper , softer region ( i.e. , above the dashed line ) .",
    "( there is , however , a hint in fig .",
    "[ fig : visit1_2_882_softvhard ] that , during observation  882 , the source softness increased at the time of highest soft - band counting rate . ) ngc  4395 exhibited stronger flares during the _ xmm - newton _",
    "observation than during the _ chandra _ observations .",
    "consequently , the _ xmm - newton _ data exhibit both higher flux and softer variability .      the simplest model for explaining",
    "the x - ray variability is to suppose that variations in a single parameter , such as mass - accretion rate , produces variability on both short and long timescales .",
    "as this parameter varies , the object will trace out a track in a plot of soft - band versus hard - band intensity .",
    "different overall flux levels , and spectral properties , then correspond to different locations along this track . during visit  2 , however , a different track is traced out compared to visit  1 and observation  882 .",
    "this shows that the long - term ( i.e. , _",
    "inter_-observation , @xmath52  ks ) variability between these two observations is in a different sense from the short - term ( i.e. _ intra_-observation , @xmath53  ks ) variability . between visit  1 and visit  2 the mean hard - band ( 3.48.0  kev ) counting rate does not change significantly while the soft - band ( 0.43.4  kev ) counting rate is scaled down .",
    "one possibility for this spectral change is that the underlying power law may have flattened between visit  1 and visit  2 . in the two - phase model of agns",
    "( and also black hole binary ) x - ray emission , the hot phase ( i.e. , the corona ) inverse - compton scatters seed photons from the cold phase ( i.e. , the disk ) @xcite .",
    "the corona and disk are radiatively coupled so that some fraction of the photons scattered in the corona return to the disk and are reprocessed to become seed photons , which for agns are seen presumably at uv wavelengths . in this scenario ,",
    "the photon index of the power - law emission depends on the rate at which energy is dissipated into the corona , the physical properties of the corona , and the geometry of the disk - corona system .    for a pair - dominated corona",
    ", variations in the compactness can produce variations in the photon index ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case ,",
    "a decrease in the luminosity will be associated with a flattening of the spectrum .",
    "this effect is unlikely to explain a decrease in the photon index between the visit  1 and visit  2 _ chandra _ observations because we observed no significant change in the hard - band counting rate .",
    "the compactness can vary also if the size of the emission region varies .",
    "a flattening of the spectrum , without a change in the source flux , could be caused by an increase in the size of the corona .",
    "alternatively , for a corona not dominated by pairs , a variation in optical depth can , in principle , produce a change in the photon index of the spectrum without an associated variation in the observed flux @xcite .",
    "variations in the photon index can also be caused by a changes in the accretion geometry , as this will influence the amount by which the corona is `` starved '' of photons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , a patchy corona can produce relatively hard spectra because a reduction in the coronal covering fraction will reduce the seed flux that enters the corona .",
    "similarly , a centrally located spherical corona may be photon starved .",
    "variations in geometry have been proposed to explain the spectral variability associated with state changes in galactic black hole binaries @xcite .",
    "these seem highly unlikely in the case of ngc 4395 , however , given the lack of hard flux variability and the short timescale of the variations , which correspond only to a few seconds in a galactic binary .",
    "state changes are usually seen on much longer time scales ( a few days ) , although an exception to this is the microquasar grs  1915@xmath54105 . in this object ,",
    "unusual `` state '' changes are observed on a timescale of seconds @xcite , but are accompanied by large changes in flux , so can not apply in ngc  4395 .",
    "the fundamental problem with intrinsic continuum changes is that to get a large change in spectral index without any change in the hard - band counting rate requires a high degree of fine tuning .",
    "any pivoting of the spectrum would need to be counteracted exactly by an appropriate variation in the flux normalization , which would depend on the pivot energy .",
    "given this , arguably a more likely explanation for the scaling down of the soft - band intensity between visit  1 and visit  2 is an increase in absorption . @xcite and @xcite have already shown evidence of a multi - zone ionized absorber in this object , and attributed short - term spectral changes to variations of the ionization parameter in response to the continuum flux .",
    "we can rule out this interpretation for the inter - observation spectral variability between visits  1 and 2 because the mean hard - band intensity does not change between the observations . rather , there would need to be an increase in the column density of the absorber , or a change in ionization unrelated to the continuum .",
    "recent detailed modeling of uv and x - ray absorbers of some sources have shown clear evidence for variations of absorbing gas due to transverse motion of gas through the line of sight ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this appears to be the most likely mechanism to account for the variations in ngc  4395 .",
    "significant scatter about the mean relation between the counting rates in two bands has been seen previously in seyfert galaxies ( see , e.g. , the  flux - flux plots  of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "ngc  4395 exhibited erratic spectral variations during visit  1 , and these were seen as deviations from the mean relation between the 0.43.4 and 3.48.0  kev counting rates .",
    "unfortunately , our data do not have a high - enough signal - to - noise ratio to investigate the nature of these variations in detail .",
    "we consider below possible explanations for how the spectral variations might be produced either within , or outside of , the x - ray emission region .",
    "one explanation was mentioned by @xcite in the context of observation  882 .",
    "those authors found significant variations in the ratio between the counting rates in 0.31.2  kev and 210  kev ( i.e. , different from our `` soft '' and `` hard '' bands ) , and they suggested that these variations are produced by changes in the column density of a single - zone warm absorber . in this kind of scenario ,",
    "the erratic variations are superimposed on the existing short - term variability .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the _ underlying _ variability in the various energy bands becomes uncorrelated at times .",
    "at the most basic level , the loss of coherence between the soft and hard intensities rules out the simplest , single - temperature comptonization models . in these models",
    ", any spectral variations should be smooth ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the presence of scatter about the mean relation between the soft - band and hard - band counting rates is possibly a manifestation of a hardening of the power spectrum at high frequencies , as is seen , for example , in ngc  7469 @xcite and mcg@xmath556 - 30 - 15 @xcite . in the context of `` propagating perturbation '' models @xcite , variations in the mass accretion rate",
    "are injected into the accretion flow over a wide range of disk radii , with the timescale of the variations being longer for larger radii .",
    "these perturbations then propagate inward and give rise to @xmath56 variations in the accretion rate at the emission region .",
    "the variations at frequencies greater than the power - spectral break are assumed to originate from within the emission region itself .",
    "the inner parts of this region experience faster perturbations , and produce harder spectra , than the outer parts , thus causing the power spectrum above the break frequency to flatten with increasing energy . in ngc  4395 , this power - spectral break is at a timescale of @xmath0500  s ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see   1 ) .",
    "our correlation analysis , however , does not probe these short timescales , so we can not appeal to propagating perturbations to explain the observed lack of coherence .",
    "one alternative is to invoke a shot - type model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which there are many short - lived , disconnected emitting regions , or ` flares ' .",
    "if these regions possess differing spectral properties , then the spectral shape of their combined x - ray emission might be expected to vary .",
    "note , however , that shot - noise models are challenged by the combined presence of a linear rms - flux correlation and a log - normal distribution of fluxes @xcite .",
    "the two - phase model @xcite predicts that the x - ray and uv emission should be linked ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the number of objects in which a definite link has been observed is somewhat controversial ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the best examples thus far are ngc  5548 @xcite , ngc  4151 @xcite , and ngc  7469 @xcite . in the last object , a correlation was seen between the uv flux and x - ray photon index , rather than between the uv and x - ray fluxes . in a number of other objects",
    "there is a very poor correlation between the bands , particularly on short time scales ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the zero - lag correlation between the x - ray and uv fluxes during visit  2 has a detection significance of @xmath099.5  % .",
    "this is a conservative estimate as it accounts for the possibility of the chance alignment of two independent flicker - noise light curves .",
    "ngc  4395 thus satisfies a basic prediction of two - phase models .",
    "the x - ray flux illuminates the material responsible for the ( pseudo - thermal ) uv emission ( e.g. , the accretion disk ) , which in turn reprocesses them into uv seed photons to be compton upscattered into the x - ray band .",
    "the two - phase model predicts that the luminosity of the reprocessed component should have the same order of magnitude as the x - ray luminosity @xcite .",
    "this implies that the amplitude of the uv flux variability should be roughly the same as that of the x - rays .",
    "we determined the fluxes of the variable x - ray and uv components by measuring the square - root of the _ unnormalized _ excess variance of the x - ray and uv data that were collected exactly simultaneously .",
    "the monochromatic flux variability was @xmath57  erg  @xmath37  s@xmath4 at both 1350   and 1  kev .",
    "we must stress that the comparison we perform here is very uncertain ; a rigorous analysis would require broad - band luminosity measurements .",
    "this is , unfortunately , hampered by the difficulties in modeling the ionized absorber in the x - ray spectrum and the fact that useful data can not be obtained in the extreme uv band .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that the x - ray and uv flux variabilities have the same order of magnitude suggests that an interpretation within the two - phase model framework is energetically reasonable .",
    "the relationship between the x - ray and uv fluxes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : visit2_uvxray_400 ] suggests that the uv flux contains a non - reprocessed component of @xmath58  erg  @xmath37  s@xmath4  @xmath4 , which is roughly 65  % of the mean flux . in the context of the two - phase model",
    ", this flux may be attributed to intrinsic emission from the accretion disk . in this scenario ,",
    "only a portion of the accretion power is dissipated in the corona , which itself must be patchy @xcite .    from a cross - correlation analysis ,",
    "the upper limit on the time lag between the x - ray and uv fluxes is about @xmath191  hour .",
    "the distance between the reprocessor and the corona must , therefore , be separated by a distance not greater than @xmath010@xmath59  cm . for a black hole mass of @xmath60  @xmath2",
    ", this corresponds to a distance of about 2000  @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the upper limit on the time lag we measured is consistent with the measured lag between the uv continuum and line fluxes found by @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting here that ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also desroches et  al .",
    "2006 ) observed @xmath010  % variations in the optical continuum of ngc  4395 , over timescales of roughly 30  minutes to 8  hours .",
    "they pointed out that this optical variability is much more rapid than expected if the variability is the result of instabilities in the disk .",
    "the rapid variations are , however , quite naturally explained in the context of x - ray reprocessing .",
    "the current puzzle is why this mechanism appears to operate in some sources , including ngc  4395 , but not in others .",
    "a possible solution can be seen in the complex behavior we see in ngc  4395 , which suggests several different origins for the flux and spectral variability ( e.g. in the seed photons , intrinsic to corona , associated with absorption ) .",
    "clearly the presence or absence of any uv / x - ray correlation will depend on the dominant mode of variability at the time of a given observation .",
    "while many claims have been made , no periodic or quasi - periodic signal has yet been robustly detected in an agn ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the detection significance of 99.0  % that we calculated for the feature at 341  s in the visit  1 power spectrum represents one of the best candidate signals found thus far . a feature at 390  s was present also during the second half of observation  882 , with a detection significance of 95.0  % , in agreement with the analysis of @xcite .",
    "this power - spectral feature , however , should be interpreted very cautiously . first , it was not detected during either visit  2 or the _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "having searched for the feature in these data , the overall `` number - of - trials '' is thus more than just the number of independent frequences in the visit  1 power spectrum .",
    "second , excess power was found only in a single frequency bin , which would correspond to a quality factor ( @xmath63 ) of greater than about 90 .",
    "in contrast , the _",
    "quasi_-periodic oscillations seen in galactic black hole binaries are broader than this , with quality factors of up to only about 30 @xcite . given that the broad - band variability is similar in agns and black hole binaries , we might also expect similarities with regard to quasi - periodic oscillations . a genuine detection",
