    "well - defined representation of real electrostatic discharge ( esd ) currents is needed in order to establish realistic requirements for esd generators used in testing of the equipment and devices , as well as to provide and improve the repeatability of tests .",
    "such representations should be able to approximate the esd currents waveshapes for various test levels , test set - ups and procedures , and also for various esd conditions such as approach speeds , types of electrodes , relative arc length , humidity , etc .",
    "a mathematical function is needed for computer simulation of esd phenomena , for verification of test generators and for improving standard waveshape definition .",
    "functions previously proposed in the literature for modelling of esd currents , are mostly linear combinations of exponential functions , gaussian functions , heidler functions or other functions , for a review see for example @xcite .",
    "the analytically extended function ( aef ) has been previously proposed by the authors and successfully applied to lightning discharge modelling  @xcite using least - square regression modelling .    in this paper",
    "we analyse the applicability of the generalized multi - peaked aef function to representation of esd currents by interpolation of data points chosen according to a @xmath0-optimal design .",
    "this is illustrated through two examples corresponding to modelling of the iec standard 61000 - 4 - 2 waveshape ,  @xcite and an experimentally measured esd current from @xcite .",
    "esd generators used in testing of the equipment and devices should be able to reproduce the same esd current waveshape each time .",
    "this repeatability feature is ensured if the design is carried out in compliance with the requirements defined in the iec 61000 - 4 - 2 standard ,  @xcite .    among other relevant issues ,",
    "the standard includes graphical representation of the typical esd current , fig .",
    "[ fig : esd_standard ] , and also defines , for a given test level voltage , required values of esd current s key parameters .",
    "these are listed in table  [ tab : esdpar ] for the case of the contact discharge , where :    * @xmath1 is the esd current initial peak ; * @xmath2 is the rising time defined as the difference between time moments corresponding to @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the current peak @xmath1 , fig .",
    "[ fig : esd_standard ] ; * @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the esd current values calculated for time periods of 30 and 60 ns , respectively , starting from the time point corresponding to @xmath3 of @xmath1 , fig .",

    "various mathematical expressions have been introduced in the literature that can be used for representation of the esd currents , either the iec 61000 - 4 - 2 standard one  @xcite , or experimentally measured ones , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "these functions are to certain extent in accordance with the requirements given in table  [ tab : esdpar ] .",
    "furthermore , they have to satisfy the following :    * the value of the esd current and its first derivative must be equal to zero at the moment @xmath7 , since neither the transient current nor the radiated field generated by the esd current can change abruptly at that moment . *",
    "the esd current function must be time - integrable in order to allow numerical calculation of the esd radiated fields .",
    "a so - called multi - peaked analytically extended function ( aef ) has been proposed and applied by the authors to lightning discharge current modelling in  @xcite .",
    "initial considerations on applying the function to esd currents have also been made in @xcite .",
    "the aef consists of scaled and translated functions of the form @xmath8 that the authors have previously referred to as power - exponential functions  @xcite .",
    "here we define the aef with @xmath9 peaks as @xmath10 for @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "the current value of the first peak is denoted by @xmath15 , the difference between each pair of subsequent peaks by @xmath16 , and their corresponding times by @xmath17 . in each time interval",
    "@xmath18 , with @xmath19 , is denoted by @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "parameters @xmath22 are such that @xmath23 for @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . furthermore @xmath27 is given by @xmath28    when previously applying the aef , see @xcite , all exponents ( @xmath29-parameters ) of the aef were set to @xmath30 in order to guarantee that the derivative of the aef is continuous . here",
    "this condition will be satisfied in a different manner .    since the aef is a linear function of elementary functions its derivative and integral",
    "can be found using standard methods .",
    "for explicit formulae please refer to  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems 1 - 3 ) .    previously , the authors have fitted aef functions to lightning discharge currents and esd currents using the marquardt least square method but have noticed that the obtained result varies greatly depending on how the waveforms are sampled .",
    "this is problematic , especially since the methodology becomes very computationally demanding when applied to large amounts of data . here",
    "we will try one way to minimize the data needed but still enough to get an as good approximation as possible .",
    "the method examined here will be based on @xmath0-optimality of a regression model .",
    "a @xmath0-optimal design is found by choosing sample points such that the determinant of the fischer information matrix of the model is minimized . for a standard linear regression model",
    "this is also equivalent , by the so - called kiefer - wolfowitz equivalence criterion , to @xmath31-optimality which means that the maximum of the prediction variance will be minimized .",
    "these are standard results in the theory of optimal experiment design and a summary can be found for example in @xcite .    minimizing the prediction variance will in out case mean maximizing the robustness of the model .",
    "this does not guarantee a good approximation but it will increase the chances of the method working well when working with limited precision and noisy data and thus improve the chances of finding a good approximation when it is possible .",
    "it can be desirable to minimize the number of points used when constructing the approximation .",
    "one way to do this is to choose the @xmath0-optimal sampling points .    in this section",
    "we will only consider the case where in each interval the @xmath32 exponents , @xmath33 ,  , @xmath34 , are chosen according to @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a non - negative integer and @xmath37 a positive real number .",
    "note that in order to guarantee continuity of the aef derivative the condition is that @xmath38 .",
    "then in each interval we want an approximation of the form @xmath39 and by setting @xmath40 then @xmath41    if we have @xmath32 sample points , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , then the fischer information matrix , @xmath44 , of this system is @xmath45 where @xmath46 thus if we want to maximize @xmath47 it is sufficient to maximize or minimize the determinant @xmath48 .",
    "set @xmath49 then @xmath50    to find @xmath42 we will use the lambert @xmath51 function .",
    "formally the lambert @xmath51 function is the function @xmath51 that satisfies @xmath52 . using @xmath51",
    "we can invert @xmath53 in the following way @xmath54 the lambert @xmath51 is multivalued but since we are only interested in real - valued solutions we are restricted to the main branches @xmath55 and @xmath56 . since @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    "the two branches correspond to the rising and decaying parts of the aef respectively .",
    "we will deal with the details of finding the correct points for the two parts separately .",
    "finding the @xmath0-optimal points on the rising part can be done using theorem [ thm : max_shift_det ] .",
    "[ thm : max_shift_det ] the determinant @xmath59 is maximized or minimized on the cube @xmath60^n$ ] when @xmath61 are roots of the jacobi polynomial @xmath62 and @xmath63 , or some permutation thereof . + here",
    "@xmath64 is the rising factorial @xmath65 .    without loss of generality",
    "we can assume @xmath66 .",
    "fix all @xmath67 except @xmath68 .",
    "when @xmath68 increases all factors of @xmath69 that contain @xmath68 will also increase , thus @xmath69 will reach its maximum value on the edge of the cube where @xmath63 . using the method of lagrange multipliers in the plane given by @xmath63",
    "gives @xmath70 for @xmath71 . by setting @xmath72",
    "we get @xmath73 for @xmath71 . since @xmath74 is a polynomial of degree @xmath32 that has @xmath75 as a root then equation ( [ eq : diff_eq_1 ] ) implies @xmath76 where @xmath37 is some constant .",
    "set @xmath77 and the resulting differential equation is @xmath78 the constant @xmath37 can be found by examining the terms with degree @xmath79 and is given by @xmath80 , thus @xmath81 comparing ( [ eq : diff_eq_2 ] ) with the standard form of the hypergeometric function @xcite @xmath82 shows that @xmath83 can be expressed as follows @xmath84 where @xmath85 is an arbitrary constant and since we are only interested in the roots of the polynomial we can chose @xmath85 so that it gives the desired form of the expression .",
    "the connection to the jacobi polynomial is given by @xcite @xmath86 and @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 gives the expression in theorem [ thm : max_shift_det ] .",
    "we can now find the @xmath0-optimal @xmath90-values using the upper branch of the lambert w function as described in equation  ( [ eq : x_to_t ] ) , @xmath91 where @xmath67 are the roots of the jacobi polynomial given in theorem [ thm : max_shift_det ] .",
    "since @xmath92 for @xmath93 this will always give @xmath94 .    note that @xmath63 means that @xmath95 and also is equivalent to the condition that @xmath26 . in other words",
    "we are interpolating the peak and @xmath96 points inside each interval .",
    "finding the @xmath0-optimal points for the decaying part is more difficult than it is for the rising part .",
    "suppose we denote the largest value for time that can reasonably be used ( for computational or experimental reasons ) with @xmath97 .",
    "this corresponds to some value @xmath98 .",
    "ideally we would want a corresponding theorem to theorem [ thm : max_shift_det ] over @xmath99^n$ ] instead of @xmath60^n$ ] .",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath100 or @xmath101 for some @xmath102 then @xmath103 and thus there must exist some local extreme point such that @xmath104 .",
    "this is no longer guaranteed when considering the volume @xmath99^n$ ] instead",
    ". therefore we will instead extend theorem [ thm : max_shift_det ] to the volume @xmath105^n$ ] and give an extra constraint on the parameter @xmath36 that guarantees @xmath106 .",
    "let @xmath107 be the roots of the jacobi polynomial @xmath108 .",
    "if @xmath36 is chosen such that @xmath109 then the determinant @xmath110 given in theorem [ thm : max_shift_det ] is maximized or minimized on the cube @xmath99^n$ ] ( where @xmath111 ) when @xmath112 and @xmath113 , or some permutation thereof .",
    "this theorem follows from theorem [ thm : max_shift_det ] combined with the fact that + @xmath110 is a homogeneous polynomial . since @xmath114",

    "thus by theorem [ thm : max_shift_det ] the points given by @xmath112 will maximize or minimize @xmath110 on @xmath117^n$ ] .",
    "it is in many cases possible to ensure the condition @xmath109 without actually calculating the roots of @xmath108 . in the literature on orthogonal polynomials",
    "there are many expressions for upper and lower bounds of the roots of the jacobi polynomials .",
    "for instance in @xcite an upper bound on the largest root of a jacobi polynomial is given that in our case can be rewritten as @xmath118 and thus @xmath119 guarantees that @xmath109 .",
    "if a more precise condition is needed there are expressions that give tighter bounds of the largest root of the jacobi polynomials , see @xcite .",
    "we can now find the @xmath0-optimal @xmath90-values using the lower branch of the lambert w function as described in equation ( [ eq : x_to_t ] ) , @xmath120 where @xmath67 are the roots of the jacobi polynomial given in theorem [ thm : max_shift_det ] . since @xmath121 for @xmath122 this will always give @xmath123 .    note that here just like in the rising part @xmath124 which means that we will interpolate to the final peak as well as @xmath96 points in the decaying part .",
    "in this section some results of applying the described scheme to two different waveforms will be presented .",
    "the two waveforms are the standard esd current given in iec 61000 - 4 - 2 ,  @xcite and a waveform from experimental measurements from  @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath32 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 have been chosen by manual experimentation and since both waveforms are given as data rather than explicit functions the @xmath0-optimal points have been calculated and then the closest available data points have been chosen .",
    "note that the quality of the results can vary greatly depending on how the @xmath36 and @xmath125 parameters are chosen before this type of approximation scheme is applied , and in practice a strategy for choosing the values effectively should be devised . in many cases increasing the number of interpolation points ,",
    "@xmath32 , improves the results but there are many cases where the interpolation is not stable .      in this section we present the results of fitting 2- and 3-peak aef to the standard esd current given in iec 61000 - 4 - 2 .",
