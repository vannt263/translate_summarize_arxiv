    "@xmath348 must be a function of @xmath332 .",
    "thus , @xmath349 is of the same order as @xmath123 , and is very small .",
    "therefore , the potential ( @xmath350 ) is very small .",
    "finally , note that @xmath351 is a function of @xmath352 and @xmath2 . because of eq .",
    "( [ k : h ] ) for fir modes , we guess that @xmath353 may be almost independent of @xmath182 for @xmath283 .",
    "this implies that the initial mode solution created at @xmath184 of the fir modes are almost independent of @xmath182 .",
    "since @xmath123 is small , small variation @xmath354 corresponds to a large variation in the mode dependent conformal time @xmath355 in this region .",
    "since the multiplication of potential and the time - interval , @xmath356 is small , the mode solution does not change much until @xmath191 after the mode generation at @xmath184 . then",
    ", the state at @xmath209 is not much different from its ground state at @xmath184 .     for ir modes .",
    "]    collecting all of the above arguments , we propose that the initial mode solutions , which are almost independent of @xmath182 , vary only by a small amount during @xmath357 .",
    "the evolution for @xmath213 will be described by the same method as that of the uv modes with the matching condition at @xmath191 .",
    "the mode solution is given by eq .",
    "( [ v:0 ] ) and its coefficients are given by eq .",
    "( [ ab : l ] ) . for these modes we have @xmath358 . in the case of a fir modes",
    ", we have @xmath359 .",
    "then , we can use the form  ( [ sol:0 ] ) of the bessel function to determine @xmath217 : @xmath360 where we have assumed @xmath361 .",
    "thus the power spectrum for the fir modes is given by @xmath362 since @xmath363 , we have strong ( proportional to @xmath4 ) blue spectrum for this fir modes . since @xmath305 is a small positive number , the size of the spectrum slowly decreases in @xmath126 .",
    "it was argued that , in relation to the pre - big - bang scenario , this kinds of cutoff of power spectrum in the low frequency region can explain the low cmb quadrupole moments  @xcite .    for the spectrum to be continuous",
    ", the red spectrum in the uv region must be continuously deformed to the blue spectrum in the fir region .",
    "therefore , the spectrum for @xmath364 must be continuously deformed from the weak red spectrum to flat and then to weak blue spectrum .",
    "we have studied the efffects of the @xmath1deformation of robertson - walker space on the evolution of metric fluctuations in expanding cosmological background . for a given noncommutative @xmath1deformed inflationary universe",
    "the cosmological background is still described by the einstein equation since the background fields only depend on one variable @xmath53 so that the homogeneity and isotropy of the robertson - walker space are kept .",
    "the equation for linear fluctuations , however , are modified .",
    "we have shown that the modification takes the form of nonlocal interaction of the fluctuating field with itself and with the background .",
    "we have analyzed the system by perturbatively expanding the action up to the first order @xmath2 .",
    "an important consequence of the space - time non - commutativity is that for each wave number @xmath182 , there exists an earliest time @xmath184 at which the fluctuating mode is created .",
    "the origin of the mode generation phenomena is a direct consequence of the @xmath1deformation which introduces an upper bound of the comoving wave - number by eqs .",
    "( [ klimit ] ) and ( [ k : max1 ] ) .",
    "we assume that the fluctuation starts out with its vacuum amplitude at @xmath184 since the number of excitations should be conserved during the creation process .",
    "moreover , this condition restricts the physical frequency to be smaller than @xmath0 .",
    "this condition determines the initial condition of given modes for a given initial time .",
    "the deformation also generates the correction terms proportional to @xmath2 and @xmath365 to the frequency squared , which determines the time evolution of mode @xmath182 .",
    "there are two main results for the corrections to the power spectrum of the metric fluctuation due to the deformation .",
    "the first is that the deformation alters both the time dependence and the momentum dependence of the power spectrum .",
    "especially , in the case of a power law inflation , we have shown that the power spectrum slowly decreases in time as @xmath366 , where @xmath367 is a very small but positive .",
    "this time dependence of the power spectrum is a new feature of the present approach in contrast to the result of the commutative space case and to the result of ref .",
    "the fact that the power spectrum decreases in time in addition to the existence of the red shifted spectrum , can be used to resolve the gravitational hierarchy problem for the tensor mode fluctuation .",
    "another consequence of the deformation is that the momentum dependence of the power spectrum for uv modes is also dependent on time as @xmath368 , where @xmath177 is given by eq .",
    "note that @xmath300 is a small positive number for @xmath369 and is a small negative number for @xmath370 .",
    "therefore , there is a period ( @xmath371 ) of blue spectrum in the earlier time of the inflation and the spectrum becomes red after the time @xmath310 , which is determined by @xmath372 .",
    "maximal red shift occurs to the power spectrum as @xmath373 in which case @xmath374 .",
    "another interesting effect appears in the power spectrum of infra - red modes .",
    "although we can not obtain the dynamics of infra - red modes explicitly , we have suggested a form of the power spectrum from the consistency requirements .",
    "the power spectrum of the far infra - red modes ( @xmath375 ) , with @xmath155 the scale factor at @xmath235 , have a cutoff proportional to @xmath4 even though the explicit procedure needs much refining since the dynamics at early times are not known .",
    "one can use the existence of this cutoff to explain the low cmb quadrupole moment . for",
    "the spectrum to be continuous , this @xmath4 type power may change as @xmath182 increases . we know",
    "that for ultra - violet mode ( @xmath272 , eq .",
    "( 89 ) ) the spectrum becomes slightly red shifted for @xmath376 .",
    "therefore , the spectrum may change from weak blue to flat spectrum for @xmath377 .",
    "brandenberger and ho  @xcite computed the effect of the stringy space - time uncertainty relation to the power spectrum of metric fluctuations for power law inflation in the robertson - walker space . it is interesting to compare their results with that of the present paper since we have started from a different commutation relation  ( [ com : rw ] ) .",
    "we start from the basic commutation relation  ( [ com : rw ] ) and construct the theory from the first principle , although we have to use the perturbation to compute the physical effects of the deformation .",
    "let us consider the power spectra for time @xmath370 .",
    "the spectra of ref .",
    "@xcite changes from weak red for ultra - violet modes to weak blue for infra - red modes . in our case ,",
    "the far infra - red modes behaves as @xmath4 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the far infra - red modes becomes almost independent of @xmath182 for the very early times @xmath378 . since the generation time for the ultra - violet modes is of similar form as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the behavior of the spectrum in our case is similar to theirs for uv modes . the spectrum for @xmath379 changes from weak blue to weak red as @xmath182 increases . a totally new phenomena due to the @xmath1deformation , which is absent in the cases of ref .",
    "@xcite and the metric fluctuations in the commutative robertson - walker model , is the time - dependence of the spectra .",
    "we have shown that both the spectra of the ultra - violet and infra - red modes decrease slowly in time .    we have used the perturbative approximation to obtain the generic feature of the physical effect of the @xmath1deformation on the cosmological evolution",
