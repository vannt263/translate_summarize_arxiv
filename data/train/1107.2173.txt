    "we discuss how solving problem  [ problem.main ] via theorem  [ theorem.step a redone ] suffices to construct all schur - horn matrices .",
    "we also introduce an alternative notion of eigensteps : whereas outer eigensteps give the spectra of the partial frame operators @xmath76 , _ inner eigensteps _ will give the spectra of the partial gram matrices @xmath77 .",

    "this visualization suggests a new algorithm , dubbed _ top kill _ , which produces a valid sequence of eigensteps whenever it is possible to do so .",
    "in the fourth section , we further exploit the intuition behind top kill to find an explicit parametrization of the set of all valid inner eigensteps , leading to a proof of theorem  [ theorem.step a redone ] and thus an explicit construction of all schur - horn matrices .",
    "in this section , we further detail the connection between the schur - horn theorem and problem  [ problem.main ] , and then we reformulate step  a of theorem  [ theorem.necessity and sufficiency of eigensteps ] in terms of an alternative but equivalent notion of eigensteps , dubbed _ inner eigensteps_. with regards to the first point , this connection stems from letting the schur - horn matrix @xmath3 be the gram matrix @xmath31 of the sequence of vectors @xmath13 .    to be precise , given nonnegative nonincreasing sequences @xmath29 and @xmath1 where @xmath20 , the schur - horn theorem implies that problem  [ problem.main ] is feasible if and only if @xmath1 is majorized by @xmath29 padded with @xmath79 zeros .",

    "this line of reasoning is well - known  @xcite .    in this paper , we follow an alternative approach that is modeled on that of  @xcite : rather than use the schur - horn theorem to determine the feasibility of problem  [ problem.main ] , we instead independently find all solutions to problem  [ problem.main ] , see theorem  [ theorem.step a redone ] , and then use these matrices to construct all schur - horn matrices . to be precise ,",
    "note that though the schur - horn theorem applies to all self - adjoint matrices @xmath3 , it suffices to consider the case where @xmath3 is positive semidefinite .",
    "indeed , any self - adjoint matrix @xmath86 can be written as @xmath87 where @xmath3 is positive semidefinite and @xmath88 ; it is straightforward to show that the spectrum @xmath89 of @xmath86 majorizes its diagonal @xmath90 if and only if the spectrum @xmath91 of @xmath3 majorizes its diagonal @xmath92 . moreover , since @xmath3 is positive semidefinite , it has a cholesky factorization @xmath80 where @xmath93 . regarding @xmath10",
    "as the synthesis operator of some sequence of vectors @xmath94 in @xmath95 , we are thus reduced to problem  [ problem.main ] in the special case where @xmath96 .",
    "presuming for the moment that theorem  [ theorem.step a redone ] is true , we summarize the above discussion as follows :    [ theorem.self-adjoint to positive semidefinite ] given nonincreasing sequences @xmath89 and @xmath90 such that @xmath97 , every matrix @xmath86 with spectrum @xmath89 and diagonal @xmath90 can be constructed as @xmath98 where @xmath10 is any matrix constructed by taking any @xmath88 and applying theorem  [ theorem.step a redone ] where @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "moreover , any @xmath86 constructed in this fashion has the desired spectrum and diagonal .",
    "we are thus reduced to solving problem  [ problem.main ] , that is , proving theorem  [ theorem.step a redone ] ; this problem is the focus of the remainder of this paper . in light of theorem  [ theorem.necessity and sufficiency of eigensteps ]",
    ", solving problem  [ problem.main ] boils down to finding every valid sequence of outer eigensteps @xmath48 , see definition  [ definition.outer eigensteps ] , for any given nonnegative nonincreasing sequences @xmath29 and @xmath1 .",
    "we now briefly summarize an example of such an eigenstep characterization problem given in  @xcite :    [ example.5 in 3 outer ] consider the problem of constructing all @xmath101 matrices @xmath10 with unit norm columns such that @xmath102 , namely problem  [ problem.main ] in the special case where @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 . in  @xcite , it is shown that every valid sequence of corresponding outer eigensteps @xmath107 is of the form : @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are restricted so as to satisfy the interlacing requirements ( iii ) of definition  [ definition.outer eigensteps ] .",
    "specifically , @xmath109 and @xmath110 must satisfy the eleven inequalities : @xmath111 which can be simplified to @xmath112 , @xmath113 . choosing any such @xmath114 completes step  a of the algorithm of theorem  [ theorem.necessity and sufficiency of eigensteps ] ;",
    "the corresponding eigensteps   are then used in step  b to produce a @xmath101 matrix @xmath10 .",
    "for example , if @xmath115 , one particular implementation of step  b  @xcite yields the matrix : @xmath116    the previous example highlights the key obstacle in using theorem  [ theorem.necessity and sufficiency of eigensteps ] to solve problem  [ problem.main ] : finding all valid sequences of eigensteps   often requires reducing a large system of linear inequalities  .",
    "in the following sections , we provide an efficient method for reducing such systems .",
    "it turns out that this method is more easily understood in terms of an alternative but equivalent notion of eigensteps . to be clear , for any given sequence of outer eigensteps @xmath48 , recall from theorem  [ theorem.necessity and sufficiency of eigensteps ] that for any @xmath38 , the sequence @xmath43 is the spectrum of the @xmath85 frame operator   of the @xmath25th partial sequence @xmath117 . in the theory that follows ,",
    "it is more convenient to instead work with the spectrum @xmath118 of the corresponding @xmath119 gram matrix @xmath77 ; we use the same notation for both spectra since @xmath118 is a zero - padded version of @xmath43 or vice versa , depending on whether @xmath120 or @xmath121 .",
    "we refer to the values @xmath122 as a sequence of _ inner eigensteps _ since they arise from matrices of inner products of the @xmath12 s ( gram matrices ) , whereas outer eigensteps @xmath48 arise from sums of outer products of the @xmath12 s ( frame operators ) . to be precise :    [ definition.inner eigensteps ] let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be nonnegative nonincreasing sequences .",
    "a corresponding sequence of * inner eigensteps * is a sequence of sequences @xmath122 which satisfies the following three properties :    1 .",
    "@xmath51 for every @xmath123 , 2 .",
    "@xmath124 for every @xmath125 , 3 .",
    "@xmath126 for every @xmath38 .    to clarify , unlike the outer eigensteps of definition  [ definition.outer eigensteps ] , the interlacing relation ( ii ) here involves two sequences of different length ; we write @xmath127 if @xmath36 for all @xmath128 .",
    "as the next example illustrates , inner and outer eigensteps can be put into correspondence with each other :    [ example.5 in 3 ] we revisit example  [ example.5 in 3 outer ] . here , we pad @xmath129 with two zeros so as to match the length of @xmath130 .",
    "that is , @xmath105 , @xmath131 , and @xmath106 .",

    "similarly , @xmath136 and so @xmath137 , yielding : @xmath138 meanwhile , since @xmath139 for all @xmath140 , the trace conditions ( iii ) give that the values in the @xmath25th column of   sum to @xmath25 .",
    "thus , @xmath141 and @xmath142 : @xmath143 to proceed , we label @xmath144 as @xmath109 and @xmath145 as @xmath110 , at which point ( iii ) uniquely determines @xmath146 and @xmath147 : @xmath148 for our particular choice of @xmath149 and @xmath130 , the above argument shows that every corresponding sequence of inner eigensteps is of the form .",
    "conversely , one may immediately verify that any @xmath132 of this form satisfies ( i ) and ( iii ) of definition  [ definition.inner eigensteps ] and moreover satisfies ( ii ) when @xmath150 .",
    "however , in order to satisfy ( ii ) for @xmath151 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 must be chosen so that they satisfy the ten inequalities : @xmath152 a quick inspection reveals the system   to be equivalent to the one derived in the outer eigenstep formulation presented in example  [ example.5 in 3 outer ] , which is reducible to @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "moreover , we see that the outer eigensteps   that arise from @xmath153 and the inner eigensteps   that arise from @xmath154 are but zero - padded versions of each other ; the next result claims that such a result holds in general .",
    "[ theorem.inner vs outer ] let @xmath155 and @xmath156 be nonnegative and nonincreasing , and choose any @xmath20 such that @xmath157 for every @xmath120 .",
    "then every choice of outer eigensteps ( definition  [ definition.outer eigensteps ] ) corresponds to a unique choice of inner eigensteps ( definition  [ definition.inner eigensteps ] ) and vice versa , the two being zero - padded versions of each other .    specifically , a sequence of outer eigensteps @xmath158 gives rise to a sequence of inner eigensteps @xmath159 , where @xmath160 whenever @xmath161 .",

    "the proof of theorem  [ theorem.inner vs outer ] is straightforward but tedious , and so we do not present it here ; the interested reader can find it in  @xcite . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we exploit this equivalence to solve problem  [ problem.main ] .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the problem of constructing every schur - horn matrix boils down to solving problem  [ problem.main ] , which in light of  theorem  [ theorem.necessity and sufficiency of eigensteps ] , reduces to the problem of constructing every possible sequence of outer eigensteps ( definition  [ definition.outer eigensteps ] ) .",
    "moreover , by theorem  [ theorem.inner vs outer ] , every sequence of outer eigensteps corresponds to a unique sequence of inner eigensteps ( definition  [ definition.inner eigensteps ] ) .",
    "we now note that if a sequence of inner eigensteps @xmath159 exists , then @xmath0 necessarily majorizes @xmath1 . indeed , letting @xmath166 in the trace property ( iii ) of definition  [ definition.inner eigensteps ]",
    "immediately gives one of the majorization conditions ; to obtain the remaining condition   at a given @xmath58 , note that the interlacing property ( ii ) gives @xmath167 for all @xmath168 , at which point ( iii ) implies @xmath169    in this section , we prove the converse result , namely that if @xmath170 , then a corresponding sequence of inner eigensteps @xmath171 exists .",

    "we note that a similar idea is used to prove the schur - horn theorem in  @xcite ; this section s contribution to the existing literature is a simple constructive proof to replace the nonconstructive , intermediate - value - theorem - based existence proof of lemma  4.3.28 of  @xcite . in the next section ,",
    "these new proof techniques lead to a new result which shows how to systematically construct every valid sequence of inner eigensteps for a given @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we now motivate top kill with an example :    [ example.top kill ] let @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "since this spectrum majorizes these lengths , we claim that there exists a corresponding sequence of inner eigensteps @xmath178 .",

    "indeed , every such sequence of eigensteps is given by the table : @xmath183 where @xmath109 is required to satisfy @xmath184 clearly , any @xmath185 $ ] will do .",
    "however , when @xmath27 is large , the table analogous to   will contain many more variables , leading to a system of inequalities which is much larger and more complicated than  .",

    ", we consider this same simple example from a different perspective ",
    "one that leads to an eigenstep construction algorithm which is easily implementable regardless of the size of @xmath27 .",
    "the key idea is to view the task of constructing eigensteps as iteratively building a staircase in which the @xmath25th level is @xmath186 units long .",
    "for this example in particular , our goal is to build a three - step staircase where the bottom level has length @xmath187 , the second level has length @xmath188 , and the top level has length @xmath189 ; the profile of such a staircase is outlined in black in each of the six subfigures of figure  [ figure.top kill ] .",
    "two attempts at iteratively building a sequence of inner eigensteps for @xmath176 and @xmath177 . as detailed in example  [ example.top kill ]",
    ", the first row represents a failed attempt in which we greedily complete the first level before focusing on those above it .",
    "the failure arises from a lack of foresight : the second step does not build sufficient foundation for the third .",
    "the second row represents a second attempt , one that is successful .",
    "there , we begin with the final desired staircase and work backwards . that is , we chip away at the three - level staircase ( d ) to produce a two - level one ( e ) , and then chip away at it to produce a one - level one ( f ) . in each step",
    ", we remove as much as possible from the top level before turning our attention to the lower levels , subject to the interlacing constraints .",
    "we refer to this algorithm for iteratively producing @xmath190 from @xmath118 as top kill .",
    "theorem  [ theorem.top kill ] shows that top kill will always produce a valid sequence of eigensteps from any desired spectrum @xmath0 that majorizes a given desired sequence of lengths @xmath1 . ]",
    "the benefit of visualizing eigensteps in this way is that the interlacing and trace conditions become intuitive staircase - building rules .",
    "specifically , up until the @xmath25th step , we will have built a staircase whose levels are @xmath191 . to build on top of this staircase , we use @xmath25 blocks of height @xmath192 whose areas sum to @xmath193 .",
    "each of these @xmath25 new blocks is added to its corresponding level of the current staircase , and is required to rest entirely on top of what has been previously built .",
    "this requirement corresponds to the interlacing condition ( ii ) of definition  [ definition.inner eigensteps ] , while the trace condition ( iii ) corresponds to the fact that the block areas sum to @xmath193 .",
    "this intuition in mind , we now try to build such a staircase from the ground up . in the first step ( figure  [ figure.top kill](a ) ) , we are required to place a single block of area @xmath194 on the first level . the length of this first level is @xmath195 . in the second step ,",
    "we build up and out from this initial block , placing two new blocks ",
    "one on the first level and another on the second  whose total area is @xmath196 . the lengths @xmath147 and @xmath145 of the new first and second levels depends on how these two blocks are chosen .",
    "in particular , choosing first and second level blocks of area @xmath188 and @xmath197 , respectively , results in @xmath198 ( figure  [ figure.top kill](b ) ) ; this corresponds to a greedy pursuit of the final desired spectrum @xmath199 , fully completing the first level before turning our attention to the second .",
    "the problem with this greedy approach is that it does nt always work , as this example illustrates .",
    "indeed , in the third and final step , we build up and out from the staircase of figure  [ figure.top kill](b ) by adding three new blocks  one each for the first , second and third levels  whose total area is @xmath200 .",
    "however , in order to maintain interlacing , the new top block must rest entirely on the existing second level , meaning that its length @xmath201 can not equal the desired value of @xmath189 .",
    "that is , because of our poor choice in the second step , the ",
    "best \" we can now do is @xmath202 ( figure  [ figure.top kill](c ) ) : @xmath203 the reason this greedy approach fails is that it does nt plan ahead .",
    "indeed , it treats the bottom levels of the staircase as the priority when , in fact , the opposite is true : the top levels are the priority since they require the most foresight . in particular , for @xmath144 to achieve its desired value of @xmath189 in the third step , one must lay a suitable foundation in which @xmath204 in the second step .    in light of this realization",
    ", we make another attempt at building our staircase .",
    "this time we begin with the final desired spectrum @xmath205 ( figure  [ figure.top kill](d ) ) and work backwards . from this perspective",
    ", our task is now to remove three blocks  the entirety of the top level , and portions of the first and second levels  whose total area is @xmath200 . here",
