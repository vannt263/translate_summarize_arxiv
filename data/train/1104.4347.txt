    "[ globalview ] shows that in the contracting case curves are repelled from the ` slow - roll ' solution at large @xmath9 .",

    "one of our motivations for considering an initially expanding cosmology was the instability of the contracting solution at sufficiently early times .",
    "the adiabatic ekpyrotic mechanism requires that the transition phase starts out with a sufficiently small equation of state parameter , @xmath154 , which implies that prior evolution will generically be unstable to kinetic domination in the contracting case .    as shown in sec .",
    "[ phasespace ] , this is true , in particular , for the simplest potential  ( [ scalarpotential ] )  the pre - transition phase evolution corresponds to a contracting de sitter universe , which is clearly unstable .",
    "the expanding branch , on the other hand , is better behaved , as it extrapolates backwards in time to an expanding de sitter space .",
    "thus , in choosing an initially expanding universe , we have greatly expanded the basis of attraction .",
    "( it is worth emphasizing that even in the initially expanding case , the universe is driven towards a contracting ekpyrotic scaling phase . )    as mentioned in the introduction , our fiducial potential  ( [ scalarpotential ] ) serves as the simplest illustration of our mechanism . more generally , this form need only hold approximately during the transition phase , corresponding to a small range in field space , @xmath155 , and there is ample freedom in choosing the global form of the potential .",
    "that said , if we take the potential  ( [ scalarpotential ] ) at face value , then at sufficiently early times the evolution in the expanding case should correspond to an inflating space - time . in this section , we take this possibility seriously and study the transition between the initial de sitter phase to the transition phase .",
    "we will see that @xmath57 evolves smoothly between the two regimes .    to see this ,",
    "let us split the evolution into two regimes :    the ` transition ' regime , @xmath156 , where hubble friction is negligible and the scalar field equation of motion reduces to  ( [ scalareomapprox ] ) : + v_,=0  .",
    "[ eomtran ]    the ` slow - roll ' regime , @xmath157 , where the equation of motion is approximately given by 3h+v_,=0  , [ eomslow ] with @xmath158 .",
    "the field value delineating these two regions , @xmath159 , can be estimated as the value of @xmath9 at the onset of the transition phase . combining  ( [ phisol2 ] ) ,  ( [ h0 ] ) and  ( [ tbeg ] ) , we obtain _",
    "t = ( t_beg - tran ) = ( c)c , where in the last step we have used @xmath8 .",
    "we are now in a position to argue that the approximate solutions in regions i and ii match each other smoothly at @xmath160",
    ". since the potential is certainly continuous , this amounts to showing that the kinetic energy also matches continuously .",
    "the kinetic energy of the transition solution is easy to write down , as we have done it several times already , and is just the first integral of  ( [ eomtran ] ) : ^2_tranv_0e^-c / m_pl  .",
    "[ ketran ] likewise , the kinetic energy in the slow - roll regime follows from  ( [ eomslow ] ) : ^2_slow - rollv_0c^2e^-2c / m_pl .",
    "[ kesr ] it immediately follows that  ( [ ketran ] ) and  ( [ kesr ] ) are equal at @xmath160 , as we wanted to show .",
    "this result tells us that trajectories starting in the slow roll region , @xmath161 , are quickly driven to the attractor slow - roll solution and reach @xmath162 with precisely the correct kinetic energy as assumed by the transition solution .",
    "( in the notation of sec",
    ".  [ rest ] , solutions that emerge from the slow regime generically reach the transition phase with @xmath163 . )",
    "note that the spectrum of fluctuations also matches smoothly between the two regimes .",
    "the power spectrum of modes generated during the inflationary epoch is given by p_^inf = , which agrees up to an order unity factor with  ( [ power ] ) .",
    "the adiabatic ekpyrotic mechanism is the unique , non - inflationary single - field mechanism with unit sound speed that generates a scale invariant spectrum for @xmath5 on an attractor background . while originally proposed assuming a contracting universe , in this paper we have shown that the mechanism works equally well on an initially expanding background .",
    "the evolution consists of an  expanding transition phase \" , followed by a contracting ekpyrotic scaling phase .",
    "we have shown , both through analytical arguments and exact numerical integration , that the power spectrum for @xmath5 is indistinguishable from the contracting version of the mechanism .",
    "this confirms that the perturbation spectrum is to a good approximation insensitive to whether the background is expanding or contracting during mode production  scale invariance relies on a rapidly - varying equation of state parameter while the scale factor is nearly constant .    by performing a phase space analysis for both the expanding and contracting branches",
    ", we have verified that the transition phase and subsequent ekpyrotic scaling phase are attractors .",
    "the basin of attraction is broader in the expanding case , since intuitively any additional kinetic energy present at early times gets redshifted , instead of blueshifted , in this case .    for the simplest potentials considered here ,",
    "the evolution is an expanding de sitter space - time asymptotically in the past .",
    "taking this precursor inflating phase seriously , we have shown that the transition from inflation to the adiabatic ekpyrotic phase is smooth , with the scale invariant spectra generated in each phase matching at the transition , up to order unity coefficient .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the degeneracy with inflation is broken at the three - point level .",
    "unlike the nearly gaussian spectrum of inflation , the rapidly - varying equation of state @xmath13 characteristic of the adiabatic ekpyrotic phase leads to large non - gaussianities on small scales . for the simplest lifted exponential potential  ( [ scalarpotential ] ) , this results in a breakdown of perturbation theory , both at the classical and quantum mechanical levels .",
    "as shown in detail in  @xcite in the contracting case , however , this perturbative breakdown can be avoided for more general potentials of the form  ( [ genpot ] ) , but this comes at a cost  the range of scale invariant perturbations is now limited , spanning a factor of @xmath30 in @xmath31 space .",
    "these considerations should carry over to the expanding case .",
    "we leave a careful exploration of this issue to future work .",
    "the expanding version of adiabatic ekpyrosis presented here greatly expands the realm of larger cosmological scenarios in which this mechanism can be embedded .",
    "because the basin of attraction is broader compared to its contracting counterpart , the expanding mechanism is less sensitive to the details of the prior evolution . more importantly for model - building , the universe is expanding during mode production and is contracting later on , which naturally suggests embedding our mechanism in a cyclic scenario  @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that tying our mechanism to the present phase of cosmic acceleration may also explain why the @xmath30 scale invariant modes fall in the observable window .",
