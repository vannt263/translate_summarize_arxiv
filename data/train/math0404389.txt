    "kontsevich solution for deformation quantization of poisson manifolds @xcite is based on a specific qft @xcite , yet universal : use one quantization to find them all .",
    "the coefficients of the star - product , expressed as integrals on some configuration spaces , are the corresponding amplitudes .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the coefficients represent a cocycle of the cobar construction of the dg - coalgebra of kontsevich graphs , and it was conjectured that there should exist a direct combinatorial approach , as an alternative to the above analytical approach .    in this article the deformation problem for associative algebras is pulled back at the level of graphs . as a generalization , generic associative deformations of associative algebras in a generic direction , not necessarily poisson , are also considered .",
    "the corresponding cocycles are `` unitary characters '' , i.e. satisfying @xmath0 ( inverse relative to convolution ) .",
    "the `` initial value ( deformation ) problem '' at tree - level ( no loops ) has a unique solution . in the case of linear coefficients , e.g. for @xmath1 , with @xmath2 a lie algebra , the solution is expected to correspond to the hausdorff series , which is the `` forefather '' of all quantizations .",
    "this is possible since the kontsevich rule ( a kind of a dual feynman rule ) , is a cohomological pairing , allowing to pullback gerstenhaber composition from the hochschild complex .",
    "besides its value as a self contained approach ( at the mathematical level ) to the quantization problem , the present approach is relevant to the understanding of renormalization techniques .",
    "not surprisingly , since the coefficients may be interpreted as feynman integrals , the `` correction analysis '' of the star - product terms in order to yield associativity is similar to bphz renormalization via `` counter - terms method '' @xcite .",
    "connections between deformation theory and renormalization are expected to emerge .    to make the article accessible to a wider audience ,",
    "the next section is a brief recall on deformation quantization and the associated combinatorial problem ( students could perhaps start with sections [ s : dq ] , [ s : ca ] and [ s : scr ] ) .",
    "section [ s : gc ] continues with a short recall on graph cohomology from @xcite , the reduction from formality to star - products leading to section [ s : sp ] where the relevant graph operations are discussed .",
    "examples are computed in section [ s : coa ] ( see also appendix ) , which rephrases the `` correction analysis '' of @xcite in the context of the hopf algebra of graphs .    the reader in deformation theory and renormalization is invited to skim through section [ s : sp ] before considering where the correspondence between associativity and the unitarity condition for the coefficients is explained , before considering the main point stated in [ s : dgla ] .    the relation with renormalization is briefly considered as part of the concluding section .",
