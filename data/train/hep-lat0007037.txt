    "in many statistical mechanics or field theory problems one needs to calculate the macroscopic features of a system in terms of some microscopic parameters . in field theory language , the microscopic parameters are called the bare parameters and the macroscopic behavior is encoded in the low momentum @xmath0-point functions which can be used to define the renormalized quantities . expressing the renormalized quantities in terms of the bare ones is a notoriously difficult problem .",
    "the renormalization group ( rg ) method @xcite was designed in part to tackle this problem . however , its practical implementation for realistic lattice models such as spin models or lattice gauge theories is still a formidable technical enterprise .",
    "near rg fixed points , expansions are often available .",
    "the main problem consists in interpolating between fixed points .",
    "an interesting attempt to model the interpolation between the weak and strong coupling regime of an asymptotically free gauge theory can be found in a recent publication of the qcd - taro collaboration @xcite .",
    "the interpolation was performed using the monte carlo simulation following a method developed in ref .",
    ". one delicate step of this method is the choice of a finite number of operators which can be used to express the renormalized action after successive rg transformations .    in this article",
    ", we address the question of the interpolation between fixed points in models where the block spin method closes exactly and where the rg transformation can be calculated easily by numerical methods .",
    "one model satisfying these requirements is dyson s hierarchical model @xcite , for which only the local measure is renormalized according to a rather simple integral equation .",
    "this integral equation , briefly reviewed in section [ sec : hm ] can be treated with numerical integration methods @xcite , or by algebraic methods @xcite based on the fourier transform of the original equation .",
    "the second method leads to very accurate determinations of the critical exponents @xcite .",
    "one could say that the hierarchical model ( hm ) is `` numerically solvable '' , in the sense that for a given set of bare parameters , one can calculate the zero - momentum @xmath0-point functions .",
    "however , one has to repeat the tedious numerical procedure for every particular calculation and analytical expressions are more desirable . in this article , we show that this goal can be achieved by constructing the scaling variables corresponding to the fixed points governing the rg flows in the high - temperature ( ht ) phase .",
    "we use the terminology `` scaling variables '' for quantities which transform multiplicatively under a rg transformation . in ref .",
    "@xcite , where these quantitites were introduced , wegner call them `` scaling fields '' . indeed , in order to emphasize that they are functions of the bare parameters , we would prefer to call them `` scaling functions '' .",
    "however since this term is already reserved for other quantities , we will use the terminology `` scaling variables '' which seems to have prevailed @xcite over the years .",
    "the scaling variables can in principle be constructed in the vicinity of any fixed point . near a given fixed point , they are simply the eigen - directions of the linearized rg transformation . when moving away from the fixed point ,",
    "non - linear terms need to be added order by order to maintain a multiplicative renormalization .",
    "what is the domain of convergence of this expansion ?",
    "can we combine two expansions in order to follow the flows in a crossover region ?",
    "these questions are in general very difficult to answer , but if the domains of convergence of the expansions fail to overlap , the whole approach is useless .",
    "the empirical results that we will present indicate that the domains of convergence of various expansions do overlap .",
    "these results should be considered as an encouragement to pursue this approach for other models .    to limit the technical difficulties of constructing these functions to orders large enough to get an idea about the asymptotic behavior of their series expansions",
    ", we have imposed some limitations on the calculations presented below .",
    "first , we only consider the ht phase .",
    "second , we mostly consider the flows from the unstable fixed point to the ht fixed _ starting along the unstable direction_. the perturbative relaxation of this second condition will be briefly discussed .",
    "third , we only discuss the magnetic susceptibility and not the higher moments .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : hm ] , we review the basic facts about the hm and its rg transformation .",
    "we present a variant of the truncation method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite which will be used in the rest of the article .",
    "we also clarify the relationship between the truncation and the ht expansion .    in the next four sections , we present ,",
    "explain and illustrate the main ideas with a simplified one - variable model @xcite where all the calculations are not too difficult .",
    "this model is simply a quadratic map with two fixed points , one stable and one unstable .",
    "the one - variable model is presented and motivated in section [ sec : toy ] , the scaling variables are constructed in section [ sec : scalingtm ] and their convergence studied in section [ sec : largetm ] .",
    "we want to make clear that all our assertions concerning the convergence of series are based on the analysis of numerical values of the coefficients rather than on analytical results concerning these coefficients .",
    "the susceptibility is calculated in section [ sec : sustm ] . the most important result for these four sections",
    "is illustrated fig .",
    "[ fig : tmoverlap ] which shows that scaling variables can be constructed accurately in overlapping regions .",
    "the rest of the article is devoted to generalizing the construction for the hm , for which the rg transformation can be approximated by a multivariable quadratic map . in section [ sec : multi ] , we show how to choose the coordinates in order to solve the linear problem . in section",
    "[ sec : impl ] , we present approximations which allow one to calculate nonlinear expansions for the scaling variables .",
    "finally , the questions of convergence are discussed in section [ sec : hmseries ] .",

    ", we have a linear theory . trying to go beyond this first approximation",
    "has some similarities with trying to make perturbation near integrable systems in classical mechanics .",
    "in this section , we review the basic facts about the rg transformation of the hm to be used in the rest of the paper . in order to avoid useless repetitions",
    ", we will refer the reader to ref .",

    "the energy density ( or action in the field theory language ) of the hm has two parts .",
    "one part is non - local ( the `` kinetic term '' ) and invariant under a rg transformation .",
    "its explicit form can be found , for instance , in section ii of ref .",
    "the other part is a sum of local potentials given in terms of a unique function @xmath1 .",
    "the exponential @xmath2 will be called the local measure and denoted @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , for landau - ginsburg models , the measures are of the form @xmath4 , but we can also consider limiting cases such as a ising measure @xmath5 . under a block spin transformation which integrates the spin variables in `` boxes '' with two sites , keeping their sum constant , the local measure transforms according to the intergral formula @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the inverse temperature ( or the coefficient in front of the kinetic term ) and @xmath8 is a normalization factor to be fixed at our convenience .",
    "we use the fourier transform @xmath9 we introduce a rescaling of @xmath10 by a factor @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are constants to be fixed at our convenience , by defining @xmath14 in the following , we will use @xmath15 . for @xmath16 ,",
    "this corresponds to the scaling of a massless gaussian field in @xmath17 dimensions .",
    "contrarily to what we have done in the past , we will here absorb the temperature in the measure by setting @xmath18 . with these choices ,",

    "equal to or larger than @xmath32 , the definition of @xmath27 requires a subtraction ( see e. g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a practical implementation ) . in the following",
    ", we will only consider the ht phase ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "we have eliminated @xmath7 from the mapping , moving it to the initial local measure .",
    "the mapping has then fixed points independent of the temperature .",
    "one of them is the `` universal function ''",
    "@xmath34 found empirically in ref .",
    "@xcite and which can be written with great accuracy using numerical coefficients provided by koch and wittwer in ref .",
    "the initial measure as a function of @xmath7 determines a line of initial conditions in the parameter space , running from the ht fixed point , where all the initial parameters are zero , to the critical surface ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "we can derive an explicit form for @xmath36 in terms of @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 where @xmath39      to study the susceptibility not too far from the ht fixed point , we can expand @xmath27 in terms of @xmath7 .",
    "we need to expand each of the parameters to some power in @xmath7 at each level to find @xmath27 .",
    "since we choose the scaling factor @xmath12 so that @xmath7 is eliminated from the recursion , we find that @xmath40 . from the form of the recursion , eq .",

    "we define the coefficients of the expansion of the infinite - volume susceptibility by @xmath48 we define @xmath49 , the ratio of two successive coefficients , and introduce quantities @xcite , called the extrapolated ratio ( @xmath50 ) and the extrapolated slope ( @xmath51 ) , defined by @xmath52 and @xmath53 where @xmath54 is called the normalized slope .",
    "if we use the expansion @xmath55 and assume that @xmath56 and @xmath57 are constants , we find @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a constant .",

    "@xcite ) . for comparison with results described later , fig .",
    "[ fig : hmexslope ] shows these oscillations in the extrapolated slope .",
    "the ht expansion can be calculated to very high order , however , due to a large number of subleading corrections , this is a very inefficient way to obtain information about the critical behavior . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was found that one can obtain much better results by altering eq .",
    "( [ eq : httruncation ] ) .",
    "first , we can retain a much smaller number of terms in the sum ( originally from 1 to @xmath61 ) than in the expansions @xmath46_{m_{max}}$ ] .",
    "as an example , one can calculate the 1000-th ht coefficient of @xmath27 with 16 digits of accuracy using only 35 terms in the sum .",
    "second , we can simply replace the expansions @xmath46_{m_{max}}$ ] by numerical values .",
    "this is equivalent to consider the polynomial approximation @xmath62 for some integer @xmath63 at each @xmath0-step .",
    "the mapping is then confined to an @xmath63-dimensional space .",
    "there remains to decide if one should or not truncate to order @xmath64 after squaring @xmath65 .",
    "this makes a difference since the exponential of the second derivative has terms with arbitrarily high order derivatives .",
    "numerically , one gets better results at intermediate values of @xmath63 by keeping all the terms in @xmath66 .",
    "in addition , for the calculations performed later , the intermediate truncation pads the `` structure constants '' of the maps ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : multi ] ) with about fifty percent of zeroes .",
    "a closer look at section [ sec : multi ] , may convince the reader that not truncating after squaring is more natural because we obtain correct ( in the sense that they keep their value when @xmath63 is increased ) structure constants in place of these zeroes .",
    "we have thus followed the second possibility where we truncate only once at the end of the calculation . with this choice",
    "@xmath67    compared to the ht expansion , the inital truncation to order @xmath63 is accurate up to order @xmath68 .",
    "after one iteration , we will miss terms of order @xmath69 but we will also generate some contributions of order @xmath70 .",
    "after @xmath0 iterations we generate some of the terms of order @xmath71 as in superconvergent expansions ( such as newton s method to calculate the roots of a polynomial ) .",
    "before attacking the multivariable expansions of the scaling variables , we would like to illustrate the main ideas and study the convergence of series with a simple one variable example which retains the important features : a critical temperature , rg flows going from an unstable fixed point to a stable one , and log - periodic oscillations in the susceptibility .",
    "in order to obtain a simple one - variable model , we first consider the @xmath72 truncation using eq . ( [ eq : truncation2 ] ) .",
    "the mapping is then reduced to only one variable .",
    "the mapping takes the form : @xmath73 expanding the denominator and keeping terms in the mapping only up to order @xmath74 in @xmath75 , we obtain @xmath76 from eq .",

    "the behavior of the large-@xmath0 limit is not immediately apparent . simply running the recursion and examining the result yields little , as the expression becomes very complicated in short order .",
    "instead , we approximate the susceptibility near to either @xmath80 or @xmath35 , then successively build up more accurate approximations as we move the temperature away from this point .    in the following , we use the notation @xmath81 and",
    "we only consider the case @xmath82 as in the ising model .",
    "our analysis will be simplified if we remove the @xmath0-dependence of the recursion . for this purpose",

    "this corresponds to @xmath89=3 or -1 which is outside of the region where we will study the map in the following ( clearly , a cyclic behavior means no thermodynamics limit ) .",

    "it will be shown in section [ sec : hmseries ] that this corresponds to the fact that when @xmath402 becomes too large ( a value of 3.7 first exceeded at @xmath434 ) , the series expansion of @xmath427 diverges , unlike the one - variable model for which @xmath218 is analytical .",
    "it will also be shown later that the quality of the approximation between @xmath299 and @xmath435 can be improved by by treating @xmath436 , @xmath437 perturbatively .",
    "near @xmath435 , the presence of the ht fixed point starts dominating the flow but we are still far away from the linear regime . to take into account the non - linear effects ,",
    "we have calculated @xmath438 up to order 11 in @xmath7 .",
    "the reason for this modest order is that this is a multi - variable expansion .",
    "recalling the discussion about the ht expansion in section [ sec : hm ] , we can count the number of terms at each order in @xmath7 . at order two",
    ", we have @xmath439 and @xmath440 , but since the linear transformation is diagonalized , @xmath440 will only appear in @xmath441 . at order three , we have @xmath442 , @xmath443 and not @xmath444 . it is easy to see that at order @xmath233 , one has @xmath445 terms , where @xmath446 is the number of partitions of @xmath233 .",
    "it has been known from the work of hardy and ramanujan that @xmath447 it seems thus difficult to get very high order in this expansion .",
    "in order to fix the ideas , there are 41 terms at order 11 , 489 at order 20 and 13,848,649 at order 80 .    as explained in section [ sec : hmseries ] , the expansion up to order 11 has a sufficient accuracy to take over at @xmath435 .",
    "it also provides optimal ( given our use of double precision ) results for @xmath448 .",
    "as @xmath0 increases beyond 60 , one can see the effect of each order disappear one after the other .",
    "finally , the linear behavior becomes optimal near @xmath449 .",
    "this concludes our chronological discussion .",
    "the main point made was that there exists a region in the crossover where both expansions are valid .",
    "we now proceed to justify empirically the claims made above .",
    "the behavior of @xmath450 obtained by the procedure described above , has been studied following the same methods as for the one - variable model . in order to provide a comparison ,",
    "we have calculated the same quantities for the one - variable model with @xmath451 . in the following , we call this model the `` simplified model '' ( sm ) .",
    "for this special value , the critical exponents @xmath131 of the two models coincide with five significant digits .",
    "we have good evidence that both series have a radius of convergence 1 as indicated by the extrapolated ratio defined in eq .",

    "fig : shdone ] .    0.2 in    in conclusion , the function @xmath215 for the sm is a reasonably good model to guess the asymptotic behavior of @xmath450 .",
    "the situation is different for the inverse function @xmath453 .",
    "a first look at the differences is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : logco ] .    0.2 in    the quantity plotted in this figure will be used to discriminate between a finite and an infinite radius of convergence . if @xmath454 as for a radius of convergence @xmath455 , then we have @xmath456 for some constant @xmath457 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath458 as for an infinite radius of convergence , then we have @xmath459 . in the following , we will compare fits of the form @xmath460 and @xmath461 .",
    "we first consider the case of sm , where according to the our study in section [ sec : largetm ] , we should have an infinite radius of convergence .",
    "this possibility is highly favored as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : toyfit ] .",
    "one sees clearly that the solid line is a much better fit .",
    "the chi - square for the solid line fit is 200 times smaller .",
    "in addition @xmath462 as expected . in conclusion , this analysis comfirms the ratio analysis done previously and favors strongly the inifite radius of convergence possibility .",
    "the analysis for the hm is more delicate .",
    "one observes periodic `` dips '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : logco ] which make the ratio analysis almost impossible .",
    "we have thus only considered , the `` upper envelope '' by removing the dips from fig .",
    "[ fig : logco ] .",
    "the fit represents an upper bound rather than the actual coefficients .",
    "the fits of the upper envelope are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hmfit ]    the possibility of a finite radius of convergence is slightly favored , the chi - square being 0.4 of the one for the other possibility . also , the second fit does not have the @xmath462 property . from @xmath463",
    ", we estimate that the radius of convergence is about 3.7 .      as explained in section [ sec : impl ] , one can calculate @xmath438 using an expansion in @xmath7 . as in section",
    "[ sec : largetm ] , we will use an empirical series @xmath37 , calculate the corresponding @xmath384 an plug them in the scaling variables .",
    "this empirical series was calculated with an initial ising measure and @xmath464 ( see ref .",
    "again we define a quantity @xmath297 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bdn ] ) which is very small when we have good scaling and increases when the approximation breaks down .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : app ] for successive orders in @xmath7 .",
    "0.2 in    0.2 in    the solid line on the right is the linear approximation .",

    "the next line ( dashes ) is the second order in @xmath7 expansion .",
    "it becomes optimal near @xmath465 .",
    "each next order gets closer and closer to be optimal near @xmath466 .",
    "the last curve on the left is the order 9 approximation .",
    "it is hard to resolve the next two approximations on this graph .",
    "the asymptotic value is stabilized with 16 digits and one may wonder why we get only scaling with 14 or 15 digits in fig . [",
    "fig : app ] .",
    "the reason is that we use empirical data and that numerical errors can add coherently as explained in ref .",
    "this can be seen directly by considering the difference between two successive values of @xmath297 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : numerr ] .",
    "one sees that the numerical errors at each step tend to be negative more often than positive , and consequently there is a small `` drift '' which affects the last digits .",
    "we can now look at the @xmath297 defined as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bdn ] ) for @xmath402 and @xmath403 together in fig .",
    "[ fig : hmoverlap ] .",
    "if we use an expansion of order 5 in @xmath7 for @xmath202 and of order 10 in @xmath427 for @xmath402 , we can get scaling within a few percent for both variables at @xmath433",
    ". we can go below 1 part in 1000 , with an expansion of order 11 in @xmath7 and order 80 in @xmath427 . at this point ,",
    "the main problem is that the effects of the subleading correction makes the scaling properties _ worse _ when @xmath467 and @xmath0 decreases .",
    "one can improve the scaling properties by taking the effects of @xmath436 into account .",
    "a detailed study shows that one can estimate the subleading effects between @xmath468 and @xmath299 .",
    "one finds that @xmath469 it is thus possible to get a function scaling better by subtracting these correction .",
    "this improve the scaling properties by almost one order of magnitude near @xmath433 and by almost two order of magnitude near @xmath299 .",
    "it is likely that our approximation of having a single scaling variable can be corrected order by order in @xmath436 , @xmath470 etc ... .",
    "we have shown in two examples that the susceptibility can be expressed in terms of the scaling variables corresponding to the two fixed points governing the ht flows .",
    "we have given convincing evidence that the expansions of these variables have overlapping domains of convergence .",
    "several interesting questions remain to be discussed .",
    "we have not discussed in detail the initial approach of the unstable fixed point .",
    "we have just shown that it can in principle be incorporated by calculating the subleading corrections in @xmath436 , @xmath470 etc ... this study depends on the details of the initial measure .",
    "a particularly interesting set of initial measures are the landau - ginzburg models in the vicinity of the gaussian fixed point .",
    "we can use the usual perturbation theory in the quartic ( or higher orders ) coupling constant to construct the scaling variables associated with the gaussian fixed point following the procedure described above , and interpolate between the gaussian fixed point and the unstable fixed point .",
    "the question of small denominators and resonances have been circumvented by using only quantities which are free of this problem ( namely @xmath402 and @xmath403 ) in our calculation of the susceptibility .",
    "the effects of the small denominators of the other scaling variables is a complex topic presently under study @xcite .",
