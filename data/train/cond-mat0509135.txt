    "<S> on breaking the symmetry we see that the fluid one body density profiles can then show the phase separation that is present .    in equilibrium density functional theory ( dft ) </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the key quantity is the helmholtz free energy functional . </S>",
    "<S> given this functional , one can calculate the ( ensemble ) average one body density profile(s ) for a fluid of particles subject to any given external potential . </S>",
    "<S> the form of the helmholtz free energy functional depends , of course , upon the particular interaction potentials between the particles in the fluid </S>",
    "<S> . however , this functional is in general unknown , except in a few cases for 1dimensional fluids @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> none the less , in the last 30 years , a number of rather accurate _ </S>",
    "<S> approximate _ helmholtz free energy functionals have been developed for a wide class of fluids  see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and references therein . </S>",
    "<S> when attempting to construct a theory for the dynamics of the ( ensemble ) average density profile of a fluid confined in a time dependent external potential , it is very appealing , given this large body of work , to base a theory for the dynamics upon the equilibrium helmholtz free energy functional . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , if one is wanting to study the dynamics of a fluid , is it possible to just apply the relevant equilibrium helmholtz free energy functional in the dynamical theory ?    recently , marconi and tarazona derived a dynamical density functional theory ( ddft ) @xcite for fluids of brownian particles . </S>",
    "<S> their theory is based upon the equilibrium fluid helmholtz free energy functional in a rather simple way and therefore has attracted much interest . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is not exact ; it involves approximating the two body correlations in the non - equilibrium fluid by those of an equilibrium fluid with the _ same _ one body density profile @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , for all the cases where comparison with brownian dynamics ( bd ) simulations has been made , the theory has proved to be remarkably accurate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that as long as one has an accurate approximation for the equilibrium helmholtz free energy functional , then the ddft gives a good account of the dynamics for brownian fluids .    </S>",
    "<S> the present paper builds upon an earlier study @xcite , in which we considered two different _ asymmetric _ binary mixtures of particles interacting via repulsive gaussian pair potentials @xcite : @xmath1 , where @xmath2 label the two different species of particles , @xmath3 is a parameter that determines the strength and @xmath4 denotes the range of the interaction potential . for different choices of these parameters one can obtain either a mixture exhibiting bulk fluid  fluid ( macro)phase separation @xcite , or alternatively , a mixture exhibiting microphase separation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the ddft used in conjunction with an extremely simple approximate ( rpa ) helmholtz free energy functional was able to account accurately for the dynamics of phase separation induced by reducing the radius of the confining spherical cavity potential @xcite . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider similar situations but for _ symmetric _ binary gaussian core model ( gcm ) fluids , i.e.  where @xmath5 and @xmath6 , but where @xmath7 or @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of this symmetry can have a dramatic effect on the confined fluid one body density profiles in cases where there are equal numbers of particles for each species . </S>",
    "<S> as long as the confining cavity potentials are the same for both species of particles , then the ensemble ( or time ) average one body density profiles of the two species must be exactly the same . </S>",
    "<S> symmetry dictates this must always be the case , even when the fluid exhibits phase separation . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that when one breaks the symmetry of the confining cavity potential , such that the cavity walls favour one of the species , then the fluid one body density profiles can change significantly and show the influence of the phase separation  see for example the results in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1][fig:4 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we now describe further the model fluid and the ddft : the gcm fluid pair potentials have no hard core and the centres of the particles can overlap completely . such potentials arise when considers the effective potential between the centres of mass of polymers in a good solvent , see ref .  </S>",

    "<S> we consider two symmetric binary mixtures of gcm particles . in both cases @xmath11 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the first mixture , which we denote `` fluid a '' , is that with @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> fluid a exhibits microphase separation , and is similar to the fluid described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this mixture exhibits 1 - 2 ordering , i.e.  where a particle of one species preferentially has particles of the opposite species as nearest neighbours @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second mixture , which we denote `` fluid b '' , is that with @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> fluid b exhibits macrophase or bulk phase separation . </S>",
    "<S> this is driven by the fact that @xmath14 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk critical point for this mixture is at a total density @xmath15 and , by symmetry , at concentration @xmath16 .    </S>",
