    "the free energy density is also a standard quantity in statistical physics . in particular , its limit as the system size becomes infinite can be used to draw phase diagrams corresponding ( for example ) to the familiar fluid , liquid and solid phases of matter  @xcite . using the large deviations formula for erds - rnyi graphs of chatterjee and varadhan  @xcite ,",
    "chatterjee and diaconis  @xcite obtained a variational formula for the limiting free energy density for a large class of exponential random graph models .",
    "radin and yin  @xcite used this to formalize , for the first time , the notion of a phase transition for exponential random graphs , explicitly computing phase diagrams for a family of two - parameter models .",

    "such models are standard and important in the literature of social networks , see e.g. holland  @xcite and the references therein . for directed graphs , recently developed techniques based on the graph limit theory of lovasz  @xcite and the large deviations formula of chatterjee and varadhan  @xcite",

    "in particular , by carefully studying partial derivatives of the free energy density along the phase transition curve , we obtain precise scaling laws for the variance of edge and star densities and we compute exactly the limiting edge probabilities .    to explain how our results fit into the phase transition framework of  @xcite , we need to make the notions of free energy and phase transition more precise .",

    "is that essentially all relevant physical quantities in the model can be obtained through the _ free energy density _ @xmath20 in particular , the average and variance of @xmath21 and @xmath17 ( or more generally , all of their moments ) can be obtained by differentiating @xmath22 with respect to @xmath23 or @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , under appropriate conditions on @xmath24 the limit @xmath25 exists , and for any @xmath26 , @xmath27 whenever the derivative on the right hand side exists  @xcite .",
    "the limit @xmath28 is key to understanding phases of matter : for instance , for a `` typical '' energy density @xmath24 ( e.g. , based on the commonly used lennard - jones particle interaction  @xcite ) , that the function @xmath29 is analytic except along two curves with an endpoint ; these curves correspond exactly to the solid / liquid / vapor phase transitions , and the endpoint is called the critical point  @xcite .",

    "though the preceding statement is widely believed and supported by numerical experiments , proofs are possible only in very special cases ; see e.g. lebowitz et .",
    "al .  @xcite .",
    "the following analogy between the models   and   was explored in radin and yin  @xcite . for the model   we can define the free energy density in the same way , @xmath30 it is proved in  @xcite that in the undirected graph case , the limit @xmath31 is analytic except along a certain curve with an endpoint , which we will call the phase transition curve and critical point , respectively ; see figure 1(ii ) . moreover , on the curve but away from the critical point , the first order partial derivatives of @xmath29 have a jump discontinuity ; at the critical point , the first order partial derivatives of @xmath29 are continuous but the second order derivatives diverge .",

    "away from the transition curve , all partial derivatives of @xmath29 ( of any order ) exist and are finite , so in particular the variance of @xmath6 and @xmath7 decays at least as fast as @xmath39 .",
    "analogous statements can be made in the model   about the average and variance of @xmath21 and @xmath17 .",
    "more detailed statements would require an analysis of the free energy density @xmath22 for _ finite _ @xmath1 ; this is much more difficult to study than the limit @xmath29 , which be obtained ( at least in the undirected case ) via the large deviations results of chatterjee and diaconis  @xcite .",
