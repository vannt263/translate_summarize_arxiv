    "the recent measurement of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies provided by the _",
    "planck _ satellite mission ( see @xcite , for example ) have provided a wonderful confirmation of the standard @xmath19cdm cosmological model . however , when the base model is extended and other cosmological parameters are let free to vary , a few `` anomalies '' are present in the parameter values that , even if their significance is only at the level of two standard deviations , deserve further investigation .",
    "first of all , the parameter @xmath20 , that measures the amplitude of the lensing signal in the cmb angular spectra @xcite , has been found larger than the standard value with @xmath21 at @xmath22 ( @xmath23 being the expected value in @xmath19cdm ) from _ planck _ temperature and polarization angular spectra @xcite .",
    "a value of @xmath20 larger than one is difficult to accommodate in @xmath19cdm , and several solutions have been proposed as modified gravity @xcite , neutrino anisotropies @xcite , and compensated isocurvature perturbations @xcite . combining _ planck _ with data from the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) and the south pole telescope ( spt ) to better constrain the foregrounds , couchot et al .",
    "@xcite , found a consistency with @xmath24 .",
    "however the compatibility of the cmb datasets used is unclear .",
    "more recently addison et al .",
    "@xcite have found that including the @xmath20 parameter solves the tension between _ planck _ and wmap9 on the value of the derived cosmological parameters .    as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath20 anomaly persists when the _",
    "data is combined with baryonic acoustic oscillation surveys ( bao ) , it is enhanced when the cfhtlens shear lensing survey is included , but it practically disappears when cmb lensing from _ planck _",
    "trispectrum observations are considered .",
    "the @xmath20 anomaly is also still present in a @xmath25-parameter extended @xmath19cdm analysis of the _ planck _ dataset ( see @xcite ) , showing no significant correlation with extra parameters such as the dark energy equation of state @xmath26 , the neutrino mass , and the neutrino effective number @xmath27 .",
    "second , the _ planck _",
    "dataset prefers a positively curved universe , again at about two standard deviations with @xmath28 at @xmath22 .",
    "this `` anomaly '' is not due to an increased parameter volume effect but , as stated in @xcite , curvature provides a genuine better fit to the data with an improved fit of @xmath29 .",
    "when bao data is included , however , the curvature of the universe is again compatible with zero with the stringent constraint @xmath30 at @xmath31 .    the fact that both the @xmath20 and @xmath11 anomalies disappear when",
    "reliable external datasets are included suggests that their origin might be a systematic or that they are produced by a different physical effect than lensing or curvature .    in this respect",
    "it is interesting to note that a third parameter is constrained to anomalous values from the _ planck _ data . the primordial scalar spectral index @xmath32 of scalar perturbations is often assumed to be independent of scale .",
    "however , since some small scale - dependence is expected , of order @xmath33 in slow - roll inflation . ] we can expand the dimensionless scalar power spectrum @xmath34 as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the running of the spectral index , @xmath37 is the running of the running , and @xmath38 .",
    "the _ planck _ temperature and polarization data analysis presented in @xcite , while providing a small indication for a _ positive _ running different from zero ( @xmath39 at @xmath22 ) , suggests also the presence of a running of the running at the level of two standard deviations ( @xmath40 at @xmath22 ) .",
    "the inclusion of a running of the running improves the fit to the _ planck _ temperature and polarization data by @xmath41 .",
    "a discussion of the impact of this anomaly on inflationary models has been presented in @xcite .    given this result ,",
    "it is timely to discuss the possible correlations between these three anomalies , @xmath37 , @xmath20 and @xmath11 and see , for example , if one of them vanishes if a second one is considered at the same time in the analysis .",
    "moreover test if the indication for the running of the running survives when additional datasets as bao or lensing ( cmb and shear ) are considered .",
    "this is the goal of this paper .",
    "we structure the discussion as follows . in the next section",
    "we will describe the analysis method and the cosmological datasets used . in sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] we present our results and discuss possible correlations between @xmath37 , @xmath20 and @xmath11 .",
    "we also investigate the possibility that a running of the running affects current and future measurements of cmb spectral distortions , comparing our results with those of @xcite . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we derive our conclusions .",
    "we perform a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) analysis of the most recent cosmological datasets using the publicly available code ` cosmomc `  @xcite .",
    "we consider the @xmath42 parameters of the standard @xmath19cdm model , _",
    "i.e. _ the baryon @xmath43 and cold dark matter @xmath44 energy densities , the angular size of the horizon at the last scattering surface @xmath45 , the optical depth @xmath46 , the amplitude of primordial scalar perturbations @xmath47 and the scalar spectral index @xmath32 .",
    "we extend this scenario by including the running of the scalar spectral index @xmath36 and the running of the running @xmath37 .",
    "we fix the pivot scale at @xmath48 .",
    "this is our baseline cosmological model , that we will call `` base '' in the following .",
    "moreover , as discussed in the introduction , we also consider separate variation in the lensing amplitude @xmath20 , in the curvature density @xmath11 and in the sum of neutrino masses @xmath49 .",
    "the main dataset we consider , to which we refer as `` _ _ planck _ _ '' , is based on cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies .",
    "we analyze the temperature and polarization _ planck _",
    "likelihood @xcite : more precisely , we make use of the @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 high-@xmath53 likelihood together with the @xmath54 pixel - based low-@xmath53 likelihood . the additional datasets we consider are the following :    * _ planck _ measurements of the lensing potential power spectrum @xmath55 @xcite ; * weak gravitational lensing data of the cfhtlens survey @xcite , taking only wavenumbers @xmath56@xcite ; * baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) : the surveys included are 6dfgs @xcite , sdss - mgs @xcite , boss lowz @xcite and cmass - dr11 @xcite .",
