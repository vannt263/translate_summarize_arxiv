    "the recent major advances in the observation of the deep universe have substantially improved our chance to reach the redshift of galaxy formation .",
    "objects at @xmath1 begin in fact to emerge from hst observations and other deep surveys with the new - generation telescopes ( cohen _ et al . _  2000 ) .",
    "as far as we move to larger distances , however , optical ( and infrared ) observations probe galaxy spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at much shorter restframe wavelength , in the ultraviolet domain .",
    "if neglected , this change in our spectral vantage point could lead to an important bias in the interpretation of high - redshift data . in this note",
    ", we will briefly analyze some aspects of this problem dealing both with the observational side and the appropriate use of theoretical tools such as population synthesis models to match primeval galaxy evolution .",
    "one important consequence of redshift ( besides the first and most obvious effect of moving spectral features to longer wavelength ) is that the wavelength interval @xmath2 sampled by any fixed set of photometric bands will span a narrower portion of the restframe sed when observing galaxies at increasing @xmath0 , such as @xmath3 .",
    "this effect , by itself , can be of paramount importance as far as we try to gain information on galaxy stellar content by means of multicolor photometry .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] gives an illuminating example in this sense .    for a @xmath4 galaxy , for instance ,",
    "johnson four - color photometry in the _ bvri _ bands would span a wide wavelength range , from 4000 to 9000  , and collect a substantial contribution from the galaxy stellar population . on the contrary , when observing at @xmath5 with the same photometric system , we would be covering a scarce @xmath6    spectral window centered about 1600   in the galaxy restframe .",
    "quite deceivingly , our `` multicolor '' photometry at @xmath4 would translate into a nearly `` monochromatic '' estimate of the galaxy flux at @xmath5 .",
    "according to the overall color - magnitude distribution , each star in a galaxy aggregate contributes with a different weight to the integrated luminosity with varying wavelength . in buzzoni ( 1993 )",
    "we approached this problem in a statistical way introducing the concept of `` effective '' contributors in a stellar population .",
    "this quantity directly relates to galaxy integrated properties , such as total luminosity or surface brightness fluctuations ( as further explored , for instance , by tonry and schneider 1988 ) .",
    "we showed , in particular , that by sampling at a given wavelength a total luminosity @xmath7 provided by @xmath8 stars , the expected poissonian fluctuation results : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the luminosity of each composing star .",
    "if all stars have the same luminosity , then simply @xmath11 .",
    "more generally , however , a quantity @xmath12 can be defined , as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "its value gives a statistical measure of the effective number of stars that provide @xmath7 at a given wavelength .",
    "following buzzoni ( 1993 ) , a `` mean '' luminosity ( @xmath14 ) for the composing stars can also be computed as @xmath15 so that , at every wavelength , @xmath16    in fig .  [ f2 ] we show the expected value of @xmath17 for the illustrative case of a 5 gyr simple stellar population ( ssp ) with salpeter imf and [ fe / h ]  @xmath18 along with the integrated sed of the model .",
    "this should closely resemble the real case of primeval elliptical galaxies ( buzzoni 1995 ) .    as a stricking feature of the model , note that below 2000 ",
    "the effective number of `` luminous '' contributors dramatically drops by over six ( ! )",
    "orders of magnitude compared for example with the @xmath19 band value at 4000  . on the contrary , luminosity over the same wavelength range only dims by a factor of @xmath20 . in terms of surface brightness fluctuations",
    "this means , for instance , that the ultraviolet image of a galaxy consisting of @xmath21 stars should fairly compare with the @xmath19 observations of a ( @xmath22 star - poorer ) galactic globular cluster .",
    "such a severe undersampling of the galaxy stellar population in the ultraviolet range could have an important impact when studying morphology of @xmath23 ellipticals at optical wavelength ( but the same argument holds also for late - type systems ) .",
    "in particular , high - redshift objects would more likely appear as coarser systems with increasing @xmath0 ( e.g.  puerari 2001 , this conference ) .",
    "the selective sampling of galaxy stellar population with changing wavelength has even more pervasive consequences , as far as we track evolution of starforming systems at different redshift .",
    "more generally , we could describe a composite stellar population in terms of a suitable convolution of ssps according to the star formation rate ( sfr ) at the different epochs .",
    "the total luminosity at age `` @xmath24 '' results therefore : @xmath25    a mean luminosity - weighted age of the composing ssps can also be derived such as @xmath26 this could be regarded as the `` representative '' age of the stars that contribute to galaxy luminosity . we know",
    "( buzzoni 1995 ; tinsley and gunn 1976 ) that ssp luminosity evolution can be pretty well described by a simple power law such as @xmath27 with the power index @xmath28 that is a function of wavelength . as an instructive example , if we consider for the sfr a power - law time decay such as sfr  @xmath29 , .",
    "this easily derives recalling that , at age @xmath24 , @xmath30 and its time average is @xmath31 . providing that @xmath32 ,",
    "we always have @xmath33 , from which the value of @xmath34 directly follows , by definition . ] eq .",
    "( [ eq : ave ] ) becomes @xmath35 the integral has an analytical solution such as @xmath36 in bolometric , @xmath37 ( buzzoni 1989 ) and , for a constant sfr ( i.e.  @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 . at 15 gyr ,",
    "bright stars are therefore in average 3 gyr old , but this value changes according to the @xmath40 function . for a ssp with salpeter imf and @xmath41 , the luminosity power index smoothly increases from @xmath42 in the @xmath43 band to 0.94 in the @xmath19 band , and exceeds unity below 3500  .",
    "a value of @xmath44 implies that @xmath45 , that is only the youngest and more massive stars are representative contributors to galaxy ultraviolet luminosity , as discussed in the previous section .    the mean age of stars contributing to galaxy luminosity at different wavelength for a synthesis model of a 15 gyr magellanic irregular ( see buzzoni 2001 for details ) is reported in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] . note from the figure that the value of @xmath46 smoothly decreases with decreasing wavelength . as a result",
    ", high - redshift objects forcedly appear to be younger than local homologues at @xmath4 _ in spite of any intrinsic evolution . _",
    "evolutionary population synthesis models are extensively used as a reference tool to reproduce galaxy colors and investigate galaxy spectrophotometric properties at the different cosmic epochs ( buzzoni 1989 , 1995 , 2001 ; bruzual and charlot 1993 ; worthey 1994 ; bressan _ et al . _  1994",
    "; fioc and rocca - volmerange 1997 ) .",
    "besides any difference in the computational details and input physics , a crucial constraint that needs to be consistently fulfilled in the synthesis procedure concerns a suitable match of the ms and post - ms luminosity contribution in the ssp models . the so - called `` fuel consumption theorem '' of renzini and buzzoni ( 1986 ) provides a simple and very powerful tool in this sense . according to the theorem",
    ", the post - ms bolometric luminosity in a ssp of total luminosity ( @xmath47 ) is @xmath48 in the equation , the nuclear fuel refers to the amount consumed by one star leaving the ms turn - off ( to ) point along the whole post - ms evolution .",
    "this is a natural output of the theoretical stellar tracks and is therefore known with high accuracy .",
    "the scaling factor @xmath49 is the `` specific evolutionary flux '' of the ssp , and directly deals with the stellar clock , that is the relationship between ms lifetime and to stellar mass ( see renzini and buzzoni 1986 ) .",
    "in particular , we have that @xmath50 assuming that a power - law imf holds with @xmath51 ( @xmath52 for the salpeter case ) . again , the r.h .  term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : b2 ] ) is a direct output of stellar evolution theory , and @xmath53 should therefore be regarded as a `` universal '' function , that is nearly insensitive to the specific input physics of the ssp models .    a comparison of the @xmath53 scaling factor , as derived from the synthesis codes of bruzual and charlot ( 1993 ) , buzzoni ( 1989 ) , and the padova group ( bressan _ et al . _  1994 ) for a ssp with @xmath41 and salpeter imf is displayed in fig .",
    "while both the buzzoni and padova codes consistently match the fuel consumption theorem , the bruzual and charlot models show a much higher value for the specific evolutionary flux .",
    "the effect is a macroscopic one , and reaches about a 100% discrepancy at intermediate age .",
    "such higher scale factor leads , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : b ] ) , to a corresponding overestimate of post - ms luminosity at every age .",
    "the effect is quite shifty as it will not explicitly appear when considering luminosity evolution ( cf .",
    "[ f5 ] , left panel ) , but would strongly affect the theoretical prediction of galaxy m / l ratio and apparent color evolution .",
    "in the latter case , enhanced post - ms contribution would lead to a larger number of red giant stars and therefore a systematically redder color for the stellar aggregate as a whole .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
