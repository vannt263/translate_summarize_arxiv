    "the derivation of effective hamiltonians for constrained quantum systems has been considered many times in the literature with different motivations and applications in mind . roughly speaking",
    ", the available results split into two different categories which are related to two different energy scales . in the context of adiabatic quantum wave guides one",
    "considers the situation where the strong forces restricting the particle to the wave guide change their form along the direction of propagation .",
    "the eigenvalues of the transverse hamiltonian thus also vary along this direction and produce an effective adiabatic potential for the tangential dynamics , i.e.  for the propagation . in this case",
    "the tangential kinetic energy is of the same order of magnitude as the energy in the transversal modes .",
    "the geometry of the wave guide plays no role at this level . on the other hand , in the literature",
    "concerned primarily with the effects of the geometry of constraint manifolds @xcite on the effective hamiltonian , it is assumed that the constraining forces are `` constant '' along the constraint manifold .",
    "this is because the geometric effects are much smaller and would be dominated by the adiabatic potential otherwise .",
    "it is thus assumed that the tangential kinetic energy is of the same small magnitude as the geometric effects and thus much smaller than the transversal energies .    in this paper",
    "we show how these two regimes are related and derive an effective hamiltonian valid on all interesting energy scales .",
    "it contains contributions from the adiabatic potential , from a generalized berry connection and from the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the constraint manifold .",
    "the derivation is based on super - adiabatic perturbation theory and a mathematically rigorous treatment of the problem is given in @xcite .",
    "we present our results first on a general and abstract level .",
    "however , there are several concrete applications which have motivated us and the many predecessor works , most notably molecular dynamics and adiabatic quantum wave guides . in section  [ waveguides ]",
    "we apply our results to adiabatic quantum wave guides and , in particular , obtain new results about global geometric effects in quantum wave circuits , i.e.  closed wave guides .",
    "although the mathematical structure of the linear schrdinger equation @xmath0 is quite simple , in many cases the high dimension of the underlying configuration space @xmath1 makes even a numerical solution impossible .",
    "therefore it is important to identify situations where the dimension can be reduced by approximating the solutions of the original equation  ( [ se1 ] ) on the high dimensional configuration space @xmath1 by solutions of an _ effective equation _",
    "@xmath2 on a lower dimensional configuration space @xmath3 .",
    "the factor @xmath4 allows for the possibility of additional internal degrees of freedom in the effective description .",
    "a famous example for such a reduction is the time - dependent born - oppenheimer approximation : due to the small ratio @xmath5 of the mass @xmath6 of an electron and the mass @xmath7 of a typical nucleus , the molecular schrdinger equation @xmath8 on the full configurations space @xmath9 of electrons and nuclei , may be approximated by an equation @xmath10 on the lower dimensional configuration space @xmath11 of the nuclei only . in this case",
    "the interaction @xmath12 of all particles is replaced by an electronic energy surface @xmath13 , which serves as an effective potential for the dynamics of the nuclei .",
    "the assumption here is that the electrons remain in an eigenstate of the electronic hamiltonian @xmath14 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath13 .",
    "this assumption is typically satisfied , since the light electrons move fast compared to the heavy nuclei and thus the electronic state adjusts adiabatically to the slow motion of the nuclei .",
    "this is an example of _ adiabatic decoupling _ where the reduction in the size of the effective configuration space stems from different masses in the system .    a physically different but mathematically similar situation where such a dimensional reduction is possible",
    "are constrained mechanical systems . in these systems",
    "strong forces effectively constrain the system to remain in the vicinity of a submanifold @xmath3 of the configuration space @xmath1 .    for classical hamiltonian systems on a riemannian manifold @xmath15",
    "there is a straight forward mathematical reduction procedure .",
    "one just restricts the hamilton function to @xmath16 s cotangent bundle @xmath17 by embedding @xmath17 into @xmath18 via the metric  @xmath19 and then studies the induced dynamics on @xmath17 . for quantum systems",
    "dirac @xcite proposed to quantize the restricted classical hamiltonian system on the submanifold following an intrinsic quantization procedure . however ,",
    "for curved submanifolds @xmath3 there is no unique quantization procedure .",
    "one natural guess would be an effective hamiltonian @xmath20 in ( [ se2 ] ) of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath3 with respect to the induced metric and @xmath23 is the restriction of the potential @xmath24 to @xmath3 .    to justify or invalidate the above procedures from first principles , one needs to model the constraining forces within the dynamics ( [ se1 ] ) on the full space @xmath1 .",
    "this is done by adding a localizing part to the potential @xmath25 .",
    "then one analyzes the behavior of solutions of ( [ se1 ] ) in the asymptotic limit where the constraining forces become very strong and tries to extract a limiting equation on  @xmath3 .",
    "this limit of strong confining forces has been studied in classical mechanics and in quantum mechanics many times in the literature .",
    "the classical case was first investigated by rubin and ungar @xcite , who found that the effective hamiltonian for the motion on the constrained manifold contains an extra potential that accounts for the energy contained in the normal oscillations .",
    "the quantum mechanical analouge of this extra potential is the adiabatic potential .",
    "the intrinsic geometry of the submanifold only appears in the definition of the kinetic energy @xmath26 , its embedding into the ambient space @xmath1 plays no role .    on the other hand , for the quantum mechanical case marcus @xcite and later on jensen and koppe  @xcite and da costa @xcite pointed out that the limiting quantum hamiltonian contains a potential term , the geometric potential , that depends on the embedding of the submanifold  @xmath3 into the ambient space  @xmath1 .",
    "but these statements ( like the more refined results by froese - herbst @xcite , maraner @xcite and mitchell @xcite ) require that the constraining potential is the same at each point on the constraint manifold .",
    "the reason behind this assumption is that in the limit of strong confinement the adiabatic potential is much larger ( by two orders in the adiabatic parameter ) than the geometric potential .",
    "for the geometric potential to be of leading order one must thus assume that the tangential kinetic energy is of the same small order . then one ends up in the situation where the energy in the transversal modes is much larger than the typical tangential energies and where , by assumption , any transfer of energy between transversal and tangential modes is suppressed . in conclusion , the effective hamiltonian obtained in this way describes the constrained system only for very small energies and under very restrictive assumptions on the confining potential .",
    "note that in many important applications the assumption of a constant confining potential is violated .",
    "for example for the reaction paths of molecular reactions , the valleys vary in shape depending on the configuration of the nuclei .    in this work we present a general result concerning the precise form of the limiting dynamics  ( [ se2 ] ) on an arbitrary constraint manifold @xmath3 starting from ( [ se1 ] ) on the ambient space @xmath1 with a strongly confining potential @xmath25 .",
    "the most important new aspect of our result is that we allow for confining potentials that vary in shape and for solutions with normal and tangential energies of the same order and , at the same time , capture the effects of geometry . as a consequence , our effective hamiltonian on the constraint manifold has a richer structure than earlier results and resembles , at leading order , the results from classical mechanics .",
    "however , similar to the hierarchic structure of the spectrum of molecules , with electronic , vibrational and rotational levels , now different geometric effects appear in the higher order corrections to the effective hamiltonian .",
    "we note that in the limit of small tangential energies and under the same restrictive assumptions on the confining potential we recover the limiting dynamics by mitchell  @xcite .",
    "the key observation for our analysis is that the problem is an adiabatic limit and has , at least locally , a structure similar to the born - oppenheimer approximation in molecular dynamics . in particular , we transfer ideas from adiabatic perturbation theory , which were developed on a rigorous level by nenciu - martinez - sordoni @xcite and panati - spohn - teufel in @xcite and independently on a theoretical physics level by belov - dobrokhotov - tudorovskiy in @xcite , to a non - flat geometry .",
    "we note that the adiabatic nature of the problem was observed many times before in the physics literature , e.g.  in the context of adiabatic quantum wave guides and thin films  @xcite .",
    "but the only work considering constraint manifolds with general geometries in quantum mechanics from this point of view so far is @xcite , where only the leading order dynamics of localized semiclassical wave packets is analyzed and effects of geometry or geometric phases play no role .",
    "we thus believe that our effective equations have not been derived before , neither on a mathematical nor on a theoretical physics level .      before we describe the general setup , it is instructive to first explain the scaling and the different energy scales within the simple example of a straight quantum wave guide in two dimensions .",
    "let @xmath27 be the coordinate in the direction of propagation and @xmath28 the transversal direction .",
    "saying that the potential @xmath29 is ( at least partially ) confining in the @xmath28 direction just means , that the normal or transverse hamiltonian @xmath30 has some eigenvalues @xmath31 with localized eigenfunctions @xmath32 , the constrained normal modes .",
    "for a sketch of such a potential see figure  [ fig1](a ) .",
    "now we would like to implement the asymptotic limit of strong confinement in such a way , that the eigenfunctions of the scaled hamiltonian @xmath33 become localized on a length scale of order @xmath34 .",
    "this is done by scaling the potential @xmath35 , which yields restoring forces of order @xmath36 .",
    "however , localization on a scale of order @xmath37 leads to kinetic energies of order @xmath38 .",
    "so in order to see localization one has to increase not only the forces but also the potential energies to the same level by putting @xmath39 then the normal energies and eigenfunctions are just @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the full hamiltonian becomes @xmath42 in order to understand the asymptotic limit @xmath43 it is more convenient to rescale units of energy in such a way that the transverse energies are of order one again , i.e.  to look at @xmath44 changing units of length in the transverse direction to @xmath45 finally leads to the form of the hamiltonian @xmath46 for which the normal eigenfunctions @xmath47 are independent of @xmath37 and the physical meaning of the asymptotic @xmath43 is most apparent .",
    "the limit of strong confinement really corresponds to the situation where the transversal modes are quantized with gaps of order one , while in the tangential direction the behavior is semiclassical and , in particular , the level spacing is of order @xmath48 .",
    "here it is easy to guess the leading order effective hamiltonian for the constrained system : on the subspace of wave functions of the form @xmath49 the hamiltonian acts as @xmath50 \\nonumber \\\\   & & -\\ , 2 ( { \\varepsilon}\\nabla_x \\varphi_j(x,\\tilde y))({\\varepsilon}\\nabla_x \\psi^{\\varepsilon}(x))\\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\ , { \\varepsilon}^2\\delta_x \\varphi_j(x,\\tilde y)\\psi^{\\varepsilon}(x ) \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] defining the effective hamiltonian by projecting back onto this subspace via @xmath51 and integrating out @xmath52 , one finds @xmath53 here we see how the transversal eigenvalue @xmath31 enters as an effective potential , the adiabatic potential , at leading order .",
    "e.g. , the constraining potential sketched in figure  [ fig1](a ) leads to an attractive effective potential sketched in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the two energy scales referred to in the previous section now correspond to the following situations : if one assumes `` small '' tangential energies , i.e.   @xmath54 , then all terms in ( [ heff ] ) but the term involving the adiabatic potential @xmath31 are of order  @xmath48 .",
    "thus the latter must be either constant or the kinetic energies will also become @xmath55 under the time evolution . since it turns out that the geometric potential in the case of non - straight wave guides is also of order  @xmath48 , this explains why all authors interested in geometric effects up to now assumed @xmath56 const .    in ( a ) we plotted a potential for a waveguide which widens near @xmath57 .",
    "the widening lowers the energy of normal modes and thus produces an attractive effective potential for the motion in @xmath27-direction . in ( b )",
    "the modulus of the ground state wave function is sketched .",
    "its variation in @xmath27-direction is slower than in @xmath28-direction , but its tangential derivatives already grow in @xmath37 . in ( c )",
    "the modulus of an excited state with energy of order one above the ground state is sketched .",
    "its variation in @xmath27-direction is on the same scale as the confinement , i.e.  it oscillates on a scale of order @xmath37 .",
    "thus any analysis assuming bounded tangential derivatives of the solutions will be restricted to confining potentials with constant profile.,width=8 ]     the curves @xmath58 and @xmath59 are sketches of the lowest normal eigenvalues for a waveguide potential as depicted in figure  [ fig1](a ) . on the vertical axis the spectrum of @xmath60 is drawn : one expects spectral bands starting at the minima @xmath61 and  @xmath62 of the effective potentials with level spacing of order @xmath48 .",
    "the continuum edge @xmath63 is determined by the threshold of @xmath64 .",
    "eigenstates in the lower shaded region vary on a @xmath65-scale in the @xmath27-direction as indicated in figure  [ fig1](b ) .",
    "eigenstates in the upper shaded region with energies of order one above @xmath61 have @xmath37-oscillations in the @xmath27-direction as indicated in figure  [ fig1](c ) . , width=7 ]    however , the natural scaling is to allow for tangential states @xmath66 with kinetic energies of order one , i.e.   @xmath67 .",
    "then all energies in the system are of the same order and exchange of normal and tangential energies may occur . in particular , the tangential momentum operator @xmath68 must be treated as being of order one despite the factor @xmath37 .",
    "this is the situation we will consider in the following .    in the figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] we sketch the situation for a simple waveguide in a region where it widens slightly .",
    "wave functions with tangential energies of order @xmath37 like in figure  [ fig1](b ) yield the low lying part of the spectrum .",
    "general states with finite energy above the ground state , which include all states propagating through the wave guide , have tangential energies of order one and thus @xmath37-oscillations in @xmath27-direction , as indicated in figure  [ fig1](c ) .",
    "when the confining potential depends on @xmath27 , there are , in general , no solutions with tangential kinetic energies of order @xmath48 .",
    "we also mention an extensive discussion of energy scales from a slightly different point of view in  @xcite .    before we explain the general model , it is instructive to mention two important points on the level of this simple model .",
    "first of all one might want to add an `` external potential '' @xmath69 which does not contribute to the confinement and thus is not scaled .",
    "we will allow for such an external potential with @xmath70 .",
    "note that in the previous works focussing on geometry @xcite it was added on the small energy scale , i.e.  @xmath71 .",
    "the second remark is that with the energy scales there come also time scales .",
    "the time scale on which solutions with @xmath67 propagate distances of order one are times of order @xmath36 .",
    "this is because kinetic energies of order one for particles with `` mass '' of order @xmath38 yield velocities of order @xmath37 .",
    "the small energy solutions with @xmath54 propagate even slower , so here the natural time scale are times of order @xmath38 .",
    "the best results we can prove hold for even longer times , namely for times almost up to order  @xmath72 . controlling the adiabatic decoupling for such long times makes the problem highly nontrivial .",
    "roughly speaking , for times of order one the problem is just standard time - dependent perturbation theory . for times of",
    "order @xmath36 one can use the ideas underlying the standard proof of the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics , see subsection  [ subsec1 ] . for longer times",
    ", however , one has to use `` super''-adiabatic , i.e.  higher order adiabatic perturbation theory , see subsection  [ subspace ] .",
    "here we first discuss in detail the model we consider and the assumptions involved . in the second subsection",
    "we introduce a horizontal momentum operator , the geometric generalization of @xmath68 in the previous section , which will play a crucial role in our results .",
    "then we reveal the formal similarity with the born - oppenheimer approximation , before we explain the resulting adiabatic structure of the problem in the last subsection .",
    "let @xmath15 be a riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath73 and @xmath74 a smooth submanifold of dimension @xmath75 without boundary and equipped with the induced metric @xmath76 .",
    "we consider the schrdinger equation on @xmath77 with a potential @xmath78 that localizes all states from a certain subspace of @xmath79 close to @xmath16 for small @xmath37 , which will be made precise below .",
    "so we want to start with fixed manifolds @xmath77 and @xmath16 and assume that the constraining potential @xmath80 grows fast in the directions normal to @xmath16 ( strong restoring forces ) while the variation along @xmath16 is of order one ( bounded tangential forces ) .",
    "this means we want to assume that    * _ normal derivatives of @xmath80 _ are of order @xmath36 , * _ tangential derivatives of @xmath80 _ are of order @xmath81 , * _ all derivatives of the metric @xmath19 _ are of order @xmath81 .",
    "as explained in subsection  [ subsecscaling ] , localization in the normal direction on a scale of order @xmath37 produces oscillations of order @xmath36 in the tangential directions , too .",
    "when we introduce local coordinates @xmath82 in a neighborhood of @xmath83 and coordinates @xmath84 for the normal directions , the assumptions made above correspond , by the same reasoning that leads to ( [ heps1 ] ) in subsection  [ subsecscaling ] , to the schrdinger equation @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the laplace - beltrami operator associated to @xmath15 and the non - constraining potential @xmath87 may describe external forces . here",
    "the upper index @xmath37 at @xmath88 means that we look at solutions with oscillations of order @xmath36 and the @xmath48 in front of the kinetic energy ensures that these solutions have kinetic energies of order @xmath81 . for small @xmath37 at least some solutions of this equation concentrate close to the submanifold  @xmath3 .",
    "therefore one expects that an effective schrdinger equation on  @xmath3 may be derived such that solutions @xmath89 of the effective equation approximate the solutions @xmath90 of the full equation in a suitable way .",
    "the scaling of the potential described in ( [ se2 ] ) depends on the choice of coordinates and can not be implemented globally so naively .",
    "it just serves as a motivation for the following . in order to be able to implement a similar scaling",
    "globally we assume that the submanifold @xmath16 has a tubular neighbourhood @xmath91 of fixed diameter @xmath92 .",
    "within @xmath91 it makes sense to speak of large derivatives of @xmath93 with respect to the distance to @xmath16 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath91 can now be mapped to the @xmath94-neighbourhood @xmath95 of the zero section in the normal bundle @xmath96 .",
    "on @xmath96 the scaling of the potential as in ( [ se2 ] ) can be realized due to its linear structure .",
    "moreover , for @xmath37 much smaller than @xmath94 all solutions below an arbitrary finite energy lie in @xmath97 up to errors bounded by any power of @xmath37 .",
    "therefore it is possible to work completely on the normal bundle by constructing a diffeomorphism @xmath98 and choosing a metric @xmath99 on @xmath96 such that @xmath100 is an isometry on  @xmath97 .    to avoid all regularity problems we make the following assumption .",
    "[ technisch ] the injectivity radii of @xmath77 and @xmath16 are strictly positive and all curvatures as well as their derivatives of arbitrary order are globally bounded .",
    "furthermore , @xmath101 is smooth and bounded and arbitrary derivatives of @xmath25 are also globally bounded .",
    "in particular , this implies that @xmath102 and @xmath96 may be covered by coordinate neighborhoods such that for some @xmath103 not more than @xmath104 of them overlap at each point .",
    "this allows us to do all estimates in local coordinates .",
    "our goal is now to find approximate solutions of the schrdinger equation @xmath105 on @xmath106 , where @xmath99 is the pullback of @xmath19 via the diffeomorphism @xmath100 on @xmath97 , suitably extended outside , and @xmath107 denotes the measure associated to @xmath99 .",
    "as expalined in the introduction it is helpful to rescale the normal coordinates to @xmath108 .",
    "then the equation reads @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the accordingly rescaled laplacian , whose expansion in @xmath37 is calculated in the appendices a2-a4 .",
    "since we will think of the functions on @xmath96 as mappings from @xmath16 to the functions on the fibers , the following objects will play a crucial role .",
    "consider the bundle @xmath111 over @xmath16 which is obtained when the fibers @xmath112 of the normal bundle are replaced with @xmath113 and the bundle structure of @xmath96 is lifted by lifting the action of @xmath114 on the fibers to rotation of functions .",
    "we denote the set of all smooth sections of a hermitian bundle @xmath115 by @xmath116 .    for @xmath117 the _ horizontal connection _",
    "@xmath118 is defined by @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121,n{{\\cal c}})$ ] with @xmath122 furthermore , @xmath123 is the bundle laplacian associated to  @xmath118 , i.e.  defined by @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the inverse of the metric tensor  @xmath126 .",
    "here and in the sequel we use the abstract index formalism including the convention that one sums over repeated indices .",
    "moreover , we will consistently use latin indices @xmath127 running from @xmath81 to @xmath75 for coordinates on @xmath16 , greek indices @xmath128 running from @xmath129 to @xmath73 for the normal coordinates , and latin indices @xmath130 running from @xmath81 to @xmath73 for coordinates on the full normal bundle .    to obtain local expressions for these objects we fix @xmath83 and choose geodesic coordinate fields @xmath131 on an open neighborhood @xmath132 of @xmath133 and an orthonormal trivializing frame @xmath134 of @xmath135 .",
    "we define the connection coefficients @xmath136 of the normal connection by @xmath137 .",
    "then the horizontal connection is given by @xmath138 as was already shown by mitchell @xcite , and it holds @xmath139 with @xmath140 .",
    "the latter directly follows from the former and the definition of @xmath123 . to obtain the former equation we note that for a normal vector field @xmath141 over  @xmath16 it holds @xmath142 now let @xmath121,n{{\\cal c}})$ ] be as in ( [ lift ] ) .",
    "then by definition of @xmath118 we have @xmath143 where we used ( [ christoffel ] ) and the choice of the curve @xmath144 in the last step .",
    "the basic idea for deriving an effective equation on the submanifold @xmath16 is to split the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath96 at leading order into a horizontal and a normal part relative to @xmath16 , similar to the splitting @xmath145 in the simple example of section  [ subsecscaling ] . to make this precise , first note that by construction at any point on the zero section of @xmath96 ( which we identify with @xmath16 in the following ) the tangent space splits into two orthogonal subspaces , one tangent to @xmath16 and one tangent to the fibre .",
    "hence the metric tensor @xmath146 and with it also the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath147 splits into a sum @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath16 and @xmath150 is the euclidean laplacian in the fibers @xmath151 of the normal bundle .",
    "we note that @xmath152 on functions that are constant on the fibers by ( [ laplace ] ) .",
    "we will show that also away from @xmath16 , i.e.  globally on @xmath96 , we can approximately split @xmath153 into a horizontal part , given by @xmath123 , and the laplacian in the fibre @xmath150 .",
    "the error grows linear with the distance @xmath154 to @xmath16 .",
    "then the rescaling of the normal coordinates to @xmath108 yields that @xmath155 this operator has the same form as the hamiltonian ( [ bo ] ) , which is the starting point for the time - dependent born - oppenheimer approximation , or the operator ( [ hepswg ] ) of our simple wave guide example .",
    "this suggests that also in the general situation considered here adiabatic decoupling is the mechanism that yields effective hamiltonians on @xmath16 .",
    "we now explain in more detail how to achieve the above splitting of the laplacian .",
    "an important step is to turn the measure on @xmath96 into product form .",
    "to do so we define @xmath156 where @xmath157 denotes lebesgue measure on the fibers @xmath158 and @xmath159 is the density of the original measure with respect to the product measure on @xmath96 .",
    "it is well - known that the unitary transformation of our hamiltonian with @xmath160 leads to the occurence of a purely geometric extra potential @xmath161 more precisely , it holds that @xmath162 which is shown in the second to fourth appendix .",
    "therefore after application of the unitary transformation @xmath160 and a taylor expansion of @xmath87 the rescaled hamiltonian @xmath163 is of the following form close to @xmath16 : @xmath164 we note that @xmath165 is of order @xmath81 on functions with oscillations of order @xmath36 .",
    "so the extra potential does not play a role for the leading order of the horizontal dynamics , unless the tangential kinetic energies are assumed to be small .",
    "finally , it should be kept in mind that the remaining error term is small only when it is applied to functions that decay fast in the normal directions .",
    "next we explain the principle of adiabatic decoupling in detail . for any @xmath83",
    "we define the fiber hamiltonian @xmath166 on the sobolev space @xmath167 .",
    "we consider a @xmath133-dependent family of eigenvalues @xmath168 of multiplicity @xmath169 , called an _ energy band _ in the sequel , and an associated family of normalized eigenfunctions @xmath170 : @xmath171 by definition of @xmath172 it holds @xmath173 on states that decay fast enough .",
    "then states in @xmath174 are approximately invariant under the dynamics @xmath175 for times of order  @xmath81 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the associated projector @xmath176 defined by @xmath177 is a spectral projection of @xmath172 and so we know that @xmath178=0 $ ] , @xmath179=0 $ ] , and @xmath180 .",
    "hence , @xmath181\\;=\\;[-{\\varepsilon}^2\\delta_{\\rm",
    "h},p_0]\\,+\\,{{\\cal o}}({\\varepsilon})\\;=\\;{{\\cal o}}({\\varepsilon}).\\ ] ] more precisely , the solution of the full schrdinger equation with initial value @xmath182 satisfies that @xmath183 where @xmath184 solves the following effective schrdinger equation on @xmath16 : @xmath185 it is well - known that an equation of the form ( [ eff ] ) does show interesting behavior only on the semiclassical time scale @xmath186 .",
    "the adiabatic principle , however , suggests that @xmath187 may be expected to be invariant for such and even much longer times , if the energy band @xmath188 is separated by a gap from the rest of the spectrum .",
    "therefore we also assume the following .",
    "[ luecke ] for all @xmath83 the fiber hamiltonian @xmath189 has an eigenvalue @xmath168 of multiplicity @xmath169 such that @xmath190 in addition , there is a family of normalized eigenfunctions @xmath170 which is globally smooth in @xmath133 ( in particular , the corresponding eigenspace bundle is trivializable ) and satisfies @xmath191 for @xmath192 , some @xmath193 , and all @xmath194 .",
    "an assumption about the decay is necessary because the error in the splitting @xmath195 is only small when applied to functions that decay fast enough , as was explained above .",
    "however , in lots of cases the decay is implied by the gap condition , in particular , for @xmath196 below the continuous spectrum of @xmath172 .",

    "it is easy to generalize the discussion above to a wave circuit whose curvature and potential twist are non - constant .",

    "we note that for the tang frame @xmath478 but for an arbitrarily curved wave circuit the tang frame is , in general , not globally smooth anymore .",
    "anyway the normal bundle is still trivializable because it inherits the orientation of @xmath393 and every orientable vector bundle over a curve is trivializable .",
    "while all earlier results on constrained quantum systems had to focus either on a certain energy regime or on special geometries , we have presented here results , both on the dynamics and on the spectrum , that cover all relevant energy regimes in general geometries ( recall figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we point out that our results on dynamics ( theorem [ adiabatictheorem ] and theorem [ calcheff ] ) are true for all bound state and scattering energies , as long as oscillations faster than @xmath36 are excluded .",

    "we believe that as a next step it would be interesting to apply our results to simple examples from molecular dynamics , like those that were treated for small kinetic energies by maraner in @xcite . here also the curvature of the effective berry connection , calculated in proposition [ berryphase ] , should play a role .",
