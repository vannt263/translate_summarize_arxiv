    "the ultra - relativistic heavy ion collision starts out as a state of high density nuclear matter called the quark gluon plasma(qgp ) and expands rapidly to freeze - out . during the freeze - out phase quarks and gluons",
    "form a system of strongly interacting hadrons .",
    "these hadrons continue to expand in a thermal manner until no further scattering is possible because the system becomes to dilute .",
    "however this transition from quarks and gluons(partons ) into hadrons is not a smooth affair .",
    "the expansion is very rapid and some faster or hard scattered partons fragment directly into hadron through a minijet@xcite process .",
    "thus we have thermal and minijet hadrons present in the last scattering of the hadrons .",
    "the dipion cocktail part 1 considered this mixture of sources and applied it to the dipion mass spectrum of the heavy ion fireball formed in au - au collisions at @xmath1=200 .",
    "part 1 showed that both thermal or soft production of hadrons and the minijet fragmented hadrons can be described through a set of unified formal equations .",
    "part 2(this paper ) applies this formalism to the @xmath0 dependence of dipions for au - au collisions at @xmath4 200 gev and 40% to 80% centrality .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner :    sec .",
    "1 introduction .",
    "sec . 2 review of the two component model which we use to fit the dipion data within a set of @xmath0 ranges .",
    "3 discussion of the relationship between the @xmath2 parameter and the mass and widths of resonances .",
    "4 we present a fit to 19 @xmath0 ranges for au - au collisions at @xmath4 200 gev and 40% to 80% centrality .",
    "sec . 5 summary and discussion .",
    "in this section we will alter equation 6 of part 1 so it can use breit - wigner parameters ( mass , width ) instead of phase shifts .",
    "we will also need to modify the re - scattering part of the equation in order to have the correct threshold behavior we have introduced in part 1 for the minijet partial waves .",
    "the phase shift can be written for the @xmath5 wave as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass of the resonance in the @xmath8wave and @xmath9 is its total width .",
    "@xmath10 with @xmath11 the total width at resonance , @xmath12 is the blatt - weisskopf - barrier factor@xcite for the @xmath8 of the resonance , @xmath13 is the @xmath14 center mass momentum , @xmath15 is @xmath13 at resonance , @xmath7 is the mass of the resonance , and @xmath16 is center mass momentum related to the size(1.0 fm is used @xmath16 = .200 gev / c ) .",
    "using equation 1 we rewrite equation 6 of part 1 as @xmath17    the @xmath18 is the thermal production term and is constant except for the boltzmann weight(see equation 13 in part 1 ) .",
    "the expected threshold behavior @xmath19 comes from the @xmath20 term .",
    "since there is @xmath21 one of the @xmath19 is killed off by dividing by @xmath22 . in figure 6 of part 1",
    "we see we have put into our minijet @xmath23 the correct threshold @xmath19 so we need to kill off the @xmath19 of the other @xmath20 term .",
    "therefore the above equation for our minijet @xmath23 we will use @xmath24    rewriting equation 6 of part 1 for each partial wave with breit - wigner parameters the first term becomes    @xmath25    while the second term @xmath26",
    "@xmath27    where @xmath28 and @xmath29,@xmath30,@xmath31 , and @xmath32 . s , p , d and f comes from subsection 5.2 of part 1 .",
    "equation 6 of part 1 has an important factor the coefficient @xmath2 .",
    "this coefficient is related to the real part of the @xmath33 re - scattering loop and is given by equation 9 .",
    "when the pions re - scatter or interact at a close distance or a point the real part of the loop @xmath2 has its maximum value of @xmath34 .",
    "while if the pions re - scatter or interact at a distance determined by the diffractive limit the value of @xmath2 is zero .",
    "the @xmath2 which is the real part of the re - scattering factor has a simple form given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the radius of re - scattering in fm s and @xmath37 is 1.0 fm or the limiting range of the strong interaction ranging to @xmath36 = 0.0 for point like interactions",
    ".    when @xmath33 pairs interact at the diffractive limit their phase shift should be the same as the phase shift of the vacuum .",
    "the same statement is true for @xmath33 interacting at a point since asymptotic freedom demands that the strong interaction should have no effect .",
    "however values of @xmath2 in between zero and @xmath34 represent a confined volume where strongly interacting gluons , quarks and virtual mesons may influence the phase shift of the @xmath33 system .",
    "phase shifts under a breit - wigner parameters assumption depend on the mass and width of the resonance parameter . in the next section we use",
    "fits to data to determine the relationship between breit - wigner parameters and the value of @xmath2 .",
    "we have fitted 19 dipion @xmath0 ranges(see table i ) using equation 7 above for the star au - au collisions at @xmath4 200 gev 40% to 80% centrality data .",
    "we included minijets up to @xmath8 = 3 and resonances @xmath39 @xmath8 = 0 , @xmath40 @xmath8 = 1 , and @xmath41 @xmath8 = 2 . using the arguments of sec .",
    "3 of part 1 , we added the @xmath42 as a direct thermal term ( @xmath43 ) and only the @xmath39 interfered with @xmath8 = 0 minijet background .",
    "two other thermal terms are present in the cocktail , the @xmath44 and the @xmath45 .",
    "all the thermal terms have an exponential behavior with dipion @xmath0 .",
    "the spectrum of the minijet partial waves is obtained from pythia@xcite(see sec .",
    "5.2 of part 1 ) .",
    "we let the data determine which minijet partial wave to add .",
    "we find only swave minijet background is important until @xmath0 equal to 1.1 gev / c . above 1.5 gev",
    "/ c all four minijet partial waves are used up to fwave .",
    "it should be noted dwave and fwave are small effects .",
    "we used pdg@xcite for the @xmath41 mass = 1.275 gev and width = .185 gev .",
    "the @xmath42 was fitted obtaining mass = 0.9727 @xmath46 .0039 gev and width = 0.04512 @xmath46 0.01128 gev .",
    "the @xmath39 mass and width used was fixed because it was ill determined .",
    "the mass used was mass = 1.011 gev and width = 1.015 gev .",
    "the @xmath3 mass and width is explained below .",
    "finally the threshold effective mass region .280 gev to .430 gev is dominated by the swave and receives contributions from minijet fragmentation , @xmath33 swave phase shift , @xmath47 decay , hbt adding to the like sign @xmath33 distribution that has been subtracted away from the unlike sign @xmath33 and the coulomb correction between the charged pions .",
    "the minijet fragmentation is the least known of the effects since we relied on pythia , however there are large uncertainty in all the other effects .",
    "so for these fits we let the minijet fragmentation be free to fit the data and let the breit - wigner parameters for the @xmath39 determine the swave phase shifts plus leaving out all other effects .    for the @xmath2 parameter in @xmath0",
    "bins up to 1.1 gev / c the minijet swave interference is the determining factor . above 1.1 gev / c the pwave interference becomes most important .",
    "the values of @xmath2 which gives a reasonable fit are shown in table ii .",
    "we have determined that the @xmath39 pole or breit - wigner parameters is so far away from the real axis thus it is too short lived to be influenced by hadronic interactions .",
    "the @xmath3 phase shift being of a life time comparable to hadronic interaction taking place becomes most sensitive .",
