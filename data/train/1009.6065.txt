    "the spectropolarimeter sot / sp @xcite aboard the japanese _ hinode _ satellite @xcite combines 032 angular resolution and @xmath7 polarimetric sensitivity to perform seeing - free full stokes measurements of the polarized light emerging from the magnetized solar photosphere . since its launch in @xmath8 , the sot / sp instrument has allowed the solar community to investigate the solar surface magnetism under unprecedented stable conditions .",
    "_ hinode _ sot / sp observations have been largely exploited to investigate the quiet sun magnetism .",
    "its global properties have been described by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ; while detailed analyses of its local properties , in relation with the temporal evolution due to the interaction with plasma motions , have been carried out by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the above studies have been performed exploiting inversion techniques for interpretation of the observed stokes profiles . in most of the cases ,",
    "the hypothesis of me atmosphere has been adopted to infer the properties of the magnetic field vector in _ hinode _ resolution elements .",
    "it assumes that the polarization is produced in an atmosphere where the magnetic field vector is constant .",
    "this approximation is a good compromise to interpret large data sets in reasonable times , as the ones obtained by _",
    "hinode_. however , it is important to realize that _ hinode _",
    "angular resolution is still too low to perform spectropolarimetric observations of magnetic structures that can be regarded as uniform ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as we emphasize in   [ resexam ] , asymmetric stokes profiles in _ hinode _ quiet sun observations are the rule rather than the exception , which implies the presence of unresolved structure ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the me analyses can not reproduce them , overlooking the expected coexistence of several magnetic components in a single resolution element .",
    "@xcite put forward arguments for describing the atmosphere where the polarization is formed as a micro - structured magnetic atmosphere ( misma ) , i.e. , an atmosphere in which magnetic fields have structure smaller than the photon mean - free path at the solar photosphere ( @xmath9  km ) .",
    "it can be regarded as a limiting case of structures of all sizes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the misma hypothesis simplifies the radiative transfer , yet it provides realistic asymmetric stokes profiles . under this hypothesis , the polarization from a single pixel in spectropolarimetric observations is equivalent to that produced by the average atmosphere .",
    "if one considers several components with diverse physical properties ( i.e. , thermodynamics , plasma motions , and magnetic fields ) , the resulting spectrum is not a linear combination of stokes profiles emerging from each magnetic component .",
    "rather , the superposition is non - linear , giving rise to asymmetries with the properties observed in the sun ( e.g. , with spectral lines that produce net circular polarization ) .",
    "@xcite showed how such a complex scenario can be properly adapted using a three component model misma , whose implementation in an inversion code @xcite allowed them to reproduce the full variety of profile asymmetries emerging from the quiet sun when observed with the instrumentation available at the time .",
    "stokes profiles in in and network observations performed with _",
    "exhibit very important asymmetries which encouraged us to attempt the same misma analysis on these data .",
    "we present an orderly inversion of stokes profiles observed by _ hinode _",
    "sot / sp in in and network regions .",
    "it is performed using the inversion code in @xcite , that has been recently employed to explain the reverse polarity patches found by _",
    "hinode _ in sunspot penumbrae @xcite .",
    "our work represents the first analysis of quiet sun sot / sp data that is able to reproduce the asymmetries of the stokes profiles .",
    "it allows us to obtain information contained in stokes profiles that are hidden to the me analysis . in particular , we constrain the physical properties of the unresolved magnetic structure creating the asymmetries .    the paper is structured as follows : in   [ dssel ] we briefly present the dataset and the selection of a sample subfield representative of the whole field - of - view ( fov ) . in   [ hypstra ] the inversion hypotheses are exposed in detail , together with the adopted inversion strategy , and a few inversion examples (   [ resexam ] ) . the main results from the analysis are presented in ",

    "in order to assign physical properties to each point of the portion of photosphere under examination , we work out a model atmosphere producing stokes profiles as close as possible to the observed ones . in the technical literature , this procedure is usually referred to as _ stokes profile inversion_. we perform the inversion under the misma hypothesis . in a micro - structured magnetized atmosphere ,",
    "magnetic fields vary over scales smaller that the photon mean - free - path at the solar photosphere @xcite . starting from this hypothesis , @xcite derived by inversion eleven classes of misma models representative of typical profiles observed in in and network regions at disk center .",
    "all these models are formed by three components : one of them is field - free , while the other two are magnetized .",

    "it has been shown by @xcite that , under the misma hypothesis , three is the minimum number of components with constant magnetic field required to reproduce the asymmetries of the stokes profiles observed in the network , and three seem to suffice to reproduce all quiet sun profiles @xcite .",
    "such components should be considered as a schematic representation of the average properties of the atmosphere ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we decided to take as reference height in the atmosphere the one corresponding to the base of the photosphere in typical 1d quiet sun model atmospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the photospheric lower boundary in such models is defined as the height where the continuum optical depth at @xmath61  nm equals one , which corresponds to a pressure of about @xmath62  dyn  @xmath63 . unless otherwise is mentioned explicitly",

    "the network must be identified not just as a strongly polarized region ; it is expected to be also spatially extended .",

    "[ fig4 ] , top , thin solid line ) .",
    "it is clear that the hg fields are almost completely in the in , while the network is dominated by kg fields with little contribution for fields in the hg regime . on the other hand ,",
    "the statistics of the minor component is completely dominated by strong kg fields with a maximum just at @xmath85  kg and almost null hg contribution ; this is valid for the whole subfield , in , and network .    the magnetic field strength distribution in fig .  [ fig5 ]",
    "is calculated for a height in the atmosphere of approximatively @xmath94  km , i.e. , a height representative of the formation region of the core of the lines .",
    "similarly to what is done for the definition of the reference height of the photosphere , the heights are selected as those having a total pressure of @xmath95  dyn  @xmath63 ( approximatively at 150  km in the pressure stratification of the mean photosphere ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the main difference between the two statistics in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] is the large reduction of kg fields at @xmath94  km .",
    "the magnetic structures are treated as thin fluxtubes by the inversion code , therefore , the magnetic field lines must fan out with height to maintain the mechanical equilibrium , which implies a drop in field strength , and an expansion of the magnetic structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the two factors conspire to produce the observed increase of hg fields with height ( cf .",
    "[ fig4 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "for example , the volume occupied by magnetic fields smaller than 1  kg at @xmath94  km is some @xmath96 times larger than their volume at the base of the photosphere .",
    "a very interesting result , unique to misma inversions , is the detection of a large number of mixed polarity pixels ( three examples are reported in fig .  [ figpm ] ) .",
    "these are identified by the blue contours on the cog magnetogram of fig .",
    "pixels presenting mixed polarities are very common in in , namely about @xmath4  % of the total number of inverted profiles . on the contrary ,",
    "network patches tend to be interpreted by the code as unipolar regions .",
    "we note that mixed polarities show up almost always either in the frontiers between strong signals of opposite polarity , or in low polarization regions , close to the @xmath97 level .",
    "we also note the presence of mixed polarities surrounding the large negative polarity network patch in the selected subfield ( see the upper left corner in the cog magnetogram in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "they are always found where positive small concentrations are close to the network patch .",
    "[ fig4 ] also includes the statistical properties of the mixed polarity pixels separately .",
    "contrarily to the other statistics described above , the distribution for mixed polarity pixels is not dominated by kg fields : hg and kg fields are found almost with the same occupation fraction in both in and network regions , and for both minor and major components .",
    "the distribution presents an absolute maximum at about @xmath98  kg and a secondary one at about @xmath61  g.    the fraction of analyzed photosphere occupied by magnetic fields @xmath99 can be computed as the integral of the distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , i.e. , @xmath100 considering the full subfield , the value of @xmath99 for the major and the minor components is @xmath101  % and @xmath102  % , respectively . in other words , @xmath103  % of the analyzed photosphere is field free or , more precisely , it has field strengths much smaller than the ones inferred from inversion , so that the inversion code can not distinguish them from zero .",
    "other fractions corresponding to the various components in the fov are listed in table  [ tab ] .",
    "the first moment of the magnetic field strength distributions also provides an estimate of the unsigned flux density @xmath104 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , @xmath105 and of the average field strength , @xmath106 the values of @xmath104 and @xmath107 for the various components in the fov are listed in table  [ tab ] . as the table shows , @xmath108  g considering network and in all together .",
    "this flux density is so large partly because it reflects the fraction of the @xmath10 subfield having the largest polarization signals .",
    "such fraction @xmath109 is about @xmath110 , therefore , if one considers the full subfield , the fraction of photosphere occupied by the magnetic fields inferred from our inversion is @xmath111 , and the unsigned flux density @xmath112 .",
    "the values of the filling factor and unsigned flux densities corresponding to this other normalization are also included in table  [ tab ] within parentheses .",
    "then the unsigned flux density decreases to about @xmath113  g. this still large value is put into context in   [ disc ] , but it is important to realize that it implicitly assumes the @xmath114 non - inverted subfield to have no magnetic fields .",
    "we have also tried a crude separation between granules and intergranules .",
    "a simple thresholding criterion was used , so that pixels brighter than the mean intensity are granules , and vice - versa .",

    "sot / sp resolution is insufficient to resolve the structure of the quiet sun magnetic fields ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this unresolved structure has been neglected in the analyses carried out so far , and we present the first attempt to account for it when interpreting _ hinode _ spectra .",
    "we employ the misma inversion code by @xcite , which produces very good fits .",
    "the misma description is able to reproduce the whole range of profile shapes observed by _ hinode _",
    "sot / sp in the quiet sun , which are often extremely asymmetric .",
    "this was known for advanced stokes polarimeter ( asp ) spectra @xcite , but _",
    "sot / sp has three times the spatial resolution of asp ( i.e. , @xmath118 against @xmath68 ) .",
    "the percentages of misma classes used as initial guess are different from the ones reported in @xcite",
    ". this can be due either to the inversion strategy ( e.g. , the imposed threshold to select invertible data ) or to a general modification of stokes profile shapes due to the higher spatial resolution .    as pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "the major component is the dominant source of polarization of the model since it contains the largest mass .",
    "for this reason , the statistics of the major component will be considered as the reference statistics derived from our analysis .",
    "the field strength distribution for the major component shows an important difference with respect to the results in @xcite ; in fact , our analysis is able to reveal much more hg fields than the analysis of the asp data .",
    "these are almost completely in the in , and a large part of them are found in mixed polarity pixels .",
    "moreover , the statistics on the latter shows that hg and kg fields are measured with the same probability .",
    "the in kg magnetic fields are more important in our inversion than the inversions carried out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "part of this difference is certainly due to their use of me atmospheres , unable to reproduce the important line asymmetries characteristic of the quiet sun stokes profiles .",
    "such difficulty may be secondary when dealing with slightly asymmetrical profiles , but the field strengths are inferred from the stokes  @xmath21 shapes , and any field strength extracted by fitting anti - symmetric me profiles to profiles like those in figs .",
    "[ figpm ] and [ figs ] is open to question .",
    "another part of the difference can come from the large drop of magnetic field strength with height in the atmosphere . as discussed in @xcite and in ",
    "[ res ] , a reduction of the magnetic pressure is required to maintain the mechanical balance between the magnetic structures and the field free atmosphere when the gas pressure decreases exponentially with height .",
    "such a decrease in field strength is intrinsic to the misma models , which force their components to be in horizontal and vertical mechanical equilibrium .",
    "@xcite showed that the me inversion of  @xmath0  nm gives us information on the solar atmosphere at the height of formation of the lines , which is higher than the reference height adopted in this work .",
    "when the magnetic field strength statistics is calculated at a height of @xmath94  km , then kg fields are almost absent ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , which partly reconciles our results with those inferred from me inversions .",
    "however , the shape of our distribution still differs from the one reported in @xcite in which the most probable field strength is @xmath119  g.    three additional comments regarding the field strength distribution are in order .",
    "first , kg fields are needed to explain the presence of g - band bright points in the quiet sun intergranular lanes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and , therefore , it is a sign of consistency that they show up in spectro - polarimetric observations .",
    "the occupation fraction of kg fields inferred from the inversion is of the order of a few percent , which is in good agreement with the @xmath120  % g - band bright point surface coverage recently measured @xcite .",
    "moreover , the large polarization signals that we select for inversion appear preferentially in the intergranular lanes @xcite where the bps are known to reside .",
    "second , our results do not exclude the presence of weak fields ( i.e. , fields producing weak polarization signals in the visible lines ) .",
    "our inversion retrieves the field strength of only @xmath5  % of the photospheric plasma ( see   [ res ] ) .",
    "the field strength of the rest remains unconstrained .",
    "this part is almost certainly magnetic , but with properties that remain elusive to our observation because of its complex magnetic topology that cancels zeeman signals , because of the low field strengths , or both . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show how part of these hidden fields can be revealed through misma inversion by analyzing infra - red lines .",
    "even weaker fields can be inferred and diagnosed via hanle effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to avoid overlooking the weak field component , the quiet sun regions need to be analyzed using measurements in both visible and infra - red spectral ranges , and produced by both zeeman and hanle effects .",
    "how to consistently combine these measurements remains an open issue , but such combination is certainly the way to go ( see the first attempt by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the third comment on the field strength distribution refers to discarding biases that may artificially produce kg fields .",
    "@xcite show how large noise in the stokes @xmath21 profiles of the  @xmath0  nm lines may fake kg fields .",
    "however , this effect is insignificant above a signal - to - noise ratio threshold that our typical spectra exceed .",
    "moreover , in addition to kg , noise also produces false weak dg , which we do not see .",
    "another potential source of false kg fields could be ( polarized ) stray - light from the network to the in .",
    "although we can not discard some influence close to the network patches , stray - light can not account for the bulk of the kg fields in the in .",
    "stray - light is at most 10% as measured for the broadband filter imager aboard _",
    "@xcite . it could account for 10% of the network magnetic flux artificially appearing in the in , but this represents only a few  g , thus unable to explain the some 30  g inferred for the in ( see table  [ tab ] ) .",
    "the mixed polarity regions revealed by the misma analysis are about @xmath4  % of the total number of inverted profiles , similar to the percentage reported in @xcite for asp data ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "note that the percentage of mixed polarities has not changed despite the increase of angular resolution ( from @xmath68 to @xmath118 ) , and despite the fact that the polarization signals analyzed here are generally larger ( we use a noise threshold @xmath121 times larger than the one used on asp spectra ) .",
    "the really significant difference between the two datasets is the fraction of solar surface covered by polarization signals ; @xcite invert only @xmath122  % of the surface , whereas _",
    "spectra allow us to almost double this fraction .",
    "the increase of angular resolution has certainly resolved some of the mixed polarities detected at asp angular resolution , however , at the same time , the newly revealed stokes @xmath21 profiles uncover mixed polarities at even finer spatial scales .",
    "this observation is consistent with the numerical models of solar magneto - convection and/or turbulent dynamos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they predict an intricate pattern of highly intermittent fields varying over very small spatial scales down to the diffusion length - scales .",
    "the average flux density we infer from the inverted profiles is of the order of @xmath113  g when the area of the full subfield is considered for normalization ( see table  [ tab ] ) .",
    "this value is almost twice as large as the one inferred by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath68 resolution ) , and it is also significantly larger than the ones obtained from me inversions of quiet sun _ hinode _ spectra by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath123  g for the full fov ) , and using the magnetograph equation by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath67  g ) . however , our estimate is comparable with other _",
    "hinode _ based estimates of the unsigned flux of the quiet sun ( e.g. , jin et al .",
    "2009 get @xmath124  g ) .",
    "such a difference could be explained taking into account that me inversions are blind to sub - pixel magnetic structuring .",
    "note that the average flux density from the major component ( i.e. , the dominant source of polarization ) is in good agreement with @xcite and @xcite  we get @xmath125  g , see table  [ tab ] .",
    "the small excess with respect to their results is compatible with the @xmath98  g flux contribution from mixed polarities ( see table  [ tab ] ) .",
    "the bulk of the difference seems to reside in the @xmath126  g provided by the minor component .",
    "its contribution to the flux density is more important than the modification it produces on the polarization signals ( even though it is needed to reproduce the line asymmetries ) .",
    "we present the first inversion of _ hinode _  sot / sp stokes profiles that accounts for the asymmetries of the profiles in the quiet sun .",
    "the analysis is carried out under the misma hypotheses which allows to reproduce the different profile shapes observed in the quiet sun .",
    "we follow the approach already successfully exploited to describe the asymmetries observed with @xmath68 angular resolution @xcite .",
    "the main results are as follows :    1 .",
    "we inverted 11600 sets of stokes @xmath28 and @xmath21 profiles representative of the quiet sun internetwork ( in ) and network at disk center .",
    "the inversion code is able to reproduce , in a satisfactory way , the whole variety of asymmetries revealed by _ hinode _",
    "the misma code is also able to reproduce linear polarization measurements when full stokes inversions are performed .",
    "here we report a few examples .",
    "the existence of asymmetries is certainly not negligible .",
    "some @xmath3  % of the analyzed profiles present large asymmetries , according to the rough classification used in @xcite .",
    "@xmath4% of the analyzed profiles present asymmetries that are interpreted by the misma code as due to mixed polarities in the resolution element .",
    "these pixels are found to be located either in transition regions between patches of opposite polarity , or in pixels presenting weak polarization signals .",
    "the magnetic plasma whose properties the inversion code constrains represents only @xmath5  % of the photospheric plasma .",
    "the rest remains unconstrained by our analysis .",
    "the statistics of the detected magnetic field strength at the formation height of the continuum is dominated by strong kg fields , both in the network and the in .",
    "the later , however , presents an extended tail over the whole hg domain .",
    "7 .   at the height of @xmath94  km ( representative of the formation heights of the visible lines )",
    "very little kg fields are measured .",
    "this result narrows down the gap between our field strength distribution and those inferred from me inversions by @xcite and @xcite , and it follows directly from the decrease of the field strength in response to the decrease of the gas pressure with height in the photosphere .",
    "the average flux density derived from the inverted pixels is @xmath127  g. if one considers the full analyzed subfield , it becomes @xmath113  g. the same figures for the in become @xmath128  g and @xmath129  g , respectively .",
    "these values are significantly larger than the ones obtained from me inversions of quiet sun _ hinode _ spectra by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath123  g for the full fov ) , and using the magnetograph equation by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath67  g ) . however , our estimate is comparable with other _",
    "hinode _ based estimates of the unsigned flux of the quiet sun ( e.g. , jin et al .",
    "2009 get @xmath124  g ) .    as a general concluding remark ,",
    "the analysis here presented reveals the importance of a complete interpretation of the shape of stokes @xmath21 profiles through refined inversion codes .",
    "this work should be considered as the first step in the interpretation of _ hinode _ sot / sp profile shapes . because of the wealth of information contained in the asymmetries , such a topic deserves attention from the solar community .",
    "different inversion codes and hypotheses can be adopted to interpret such asymmetries , and they will probably be able to reproduce the line shapes as well ( e.g. , a systematic variation of magnetic field and velocity along the los ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
