    "in the past , measurements of prompt photon production at both fixed - target facilities and hadron - hadron colliders , have extensively been used to constrain the gluon distribution of the proton @xcite .",
    "only recently the first data on prompt photon production in high - energy @xmath1 collisions have been reported @xcite . due to the presently still limited statistics",
    "the measurements are confined to prompt photons produced in photoproduction reactions , i.e.  to @xmath1 collisions with almost real exchanged photons ( @xmath2 ) . as is well - known ,",
    "photoproduction processes at high energies proceed by two distinct mechanisms .",
    "the incoming photon can couple either in a point - like manner to the incoming quark or antiquark ( direct process ) or hadronically as a source of quarks and gluons which in turn take part in the subsequent hard scattering process ( resolved process ) .",
    "therefore an important advantage of photoproduction measurements is to provide additional constraints on the quark and gluon content of the photon as suggested many years ago by aurenche et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "by contrast , prompt photon production in deep inelastic scattering with large @xmath0 , @xmath3 gev@xmath4 , is fully determined by the direct process and does not need any non - perturbative input for the parton content of the photon gev@xmath4 there might be a significant resolved contribution which depends on the quark and gluon distribution of the _ virtual _ photon . ] as in photoproduction .",
    "therefore this process is sensitive only to the parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) of the proton",
    ". the possible information on the proton pdf s would be complementary to the @xmath5 measurement from inclusive deep inelastic scattering , since _",
    "up_- and _ down_-type quarks contribute with different weights . of course , the cross sections for @xmath6 at large @xmath0 are smaller than the corresponding cross sections for almost real photons ; but with the larger luminosities planned at hera rather accurate measurements of various differential cross sections for @xmath7 gev@xmath4 seem feasible .",
    "in addition to the perturbative direct production , photons are also produced through the `` fragmentation '' of a hadronic jet into a single photon carrying a large fraction of the jet energy @xcite .",
    "this long - distance process is described in terms of the quark - to - photon and gluon - to - photon fragmentation functions ( ff s ) .    in order to unambiguously identify the prompt photon signal from the hadronic background it is necessary to apply isolation cuts in the experiment .",
    "this has the effect of reducing the cross section due to a suppression of the photon fragmentation contributions . on the other hand",
    ", it has the advantage of eliminating to a large extent the dependence on the photon fragmentation function , which is a non - perturbative input and must come from other experiments designed to measure them .    to obtain reliable predictions",
    "it is necessary to calculate the @xmath8 cross section in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of the strong coupling constant @xmath9 as has been done for @xmath10 collisions @xcite , @xmath11 annihilation @xcite , as well as photoproduction @xcite .",
    "the corresponding nlo calculation of cross sections for prompt photon production in @xmath1 scattering with large @xmath0 has not yet been done previously , neither for the technically simpler case of inclusive cross sections , i.e.   without any photon isolation cut , nor for the case with isolation cuts .",
    "applicability of perturbative qcd requires that the scattering process is characterized by a large transverse momentum , provided either by the momentum transfer @xmath0 or a large transverse momentum of the hadronic final state .",
    "we consider only the case where both @xmath0 is large and the hadronic final state is characterized by a large @xmath12 .",
    "one specific possibility is to consider the case where in addition to the photon also one or more jets are observed in the final state .",
    "the detection of an additional jet may also help to identify the prompt photon events in the actual experiment . in leading order ( lo )",
    "the photon is produced by the compton process @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a photon of high virtuality emitted by the incoming electron .",
    "this partonic photon production process contributes to the @xmath15-jet final state in @xmath1 scattering ( the proton remnant jet being counted as `` @xmath16 '' jet as usual ) . in nlo",
    "the final states are @xmath17- and @xmath18-jets .",
    "the first nlo calculations for this case were done by two of us and d.   michelsen @xcite .",
    "this calculation was restricted to the case of not too large @xmath0 where it is possible to neglect the exchange of a @xmath19 boson .",
    "moreover , in this previous work the fragmentation contribution was not taken into account .",
    "therefore , photon - quark collinear singularities could not be absorbed into the fragmentation functions . instead , these singularities had been removed by explicit parton - level cutoffs . as a consequence ,",
    "the result depended strongly on these parton - photon cutoffs , in particular for subprocesses with an incoming gluon .",
    "these cutoffs are difficult to control experimentally , where hadrons combined into jets are observed and not the partons needed to define the cutoffs . in subsequent work @xcite we included the fragmentation contribution thereby avoiding the need to use parton - level cutoffs .",
    "the isolation criteria , which limit the hadronic energy in the jet containing the photon , are thus physical , i.e.  correspond to selection criteria in the experimental analysis . in a later paper @xcite we studied the sum of the @xmath17-jet and @xmath20-jet cross sections as a function of the momentum fraction carried by a photon inside a jet .",
    "we observed that this special cross section is sensitive to the fragmentation contribution , in particular to the quark - to - photon ff .    in @xcite ,",
    "only a few observables have been calculated , as for example distributions with respect to the transverse momentum , @xmath12 , and the rapidity , @xmath21 , of the photon or the most energetic jet for one particular choice of the photon isolation cut .",
    "in this paper we take up the topic of this earlier work . besides several other observables which are of interest for analyzing upcoming experimental data from hera we shall present results for @xmath12 and @xmath21 distributions already considered in @xcite for different isolation cuts .",
    "we also study possible scale dependencies to estimate the reliability of our predictions . as in @xcite",
    "we use the @xmath22 center - of - mass system to define the kinematic variables . for most of the cross section calculations a particular cone algorithm is applied to define the parton jets and to isolate the photon signal . for a few cases we shall also make use of the @xmath23 cluster algorithm .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2 a brief outline of the theoretical background to the cross section calculations as well as",
    "the technique of the calculation are given .",
    "the results for the various observables are presented and discussed in section 3 .",
    "section 4 contains a summary and some concluding remarks .",
    "in leading order , the production of photons in deep inelastic electron scattering is described by the quark ( antiquark ) subprocess ( see fig .   [ fig1 ] ) @xmath24 where the particle momenta are given in parentheses .",
    "the momentum of the incoming quark is a fraction @xmath25 of the proton momentum @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "the proton remnant @xmath28 has the momentum @xmath29 .",
    "it hadronizes into the remnant jet so that the process ( [ loprocess ] ) gives rise to @xmath17-jet final states . in the virtual photon - proton center - of - mass system",
    "the hard photon recoils against the hard jet back - to - back . in a leading - logarithmic calculation ,",
    "the effects of higher - order processes show up only via the use of the scale - violating parton distributions of the proton .",
    "the pdf s are calculated using collinear kinematics so that the event structure is the same as given by the lowest - order subprocesses , which are of order @xmath30 . from the @xmath31 vertex . ]",
    "( 160,40 ) ( 31,-1 ) ( 91,-1 )    to remove photon production by incoming photons with small virtuality and to restrict to the case where the scattered electron @xmath32 is observed , one applies cuts on the usual deep inelastic scattering variables @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath0 as measured from the momentum of the scattered lepton .",
    "in particular we restrict the calculation to values of @xmath35 gev@xmath4 ; however , since very large @xmath0 values are not relevant at hera we can neglect contributions from @xmath19 boson exchange .",
    "in addition , to have photons @xmath36 of sufficiently large energy we require an explicit cut on their transverse momentum . finally , a cut on the invariant mass of the hadronic final state is also applied .",
    "both leptons and quarks emit photons .",
    "the subset of diagrams where the photon is emitted from the initial or final state lepton ( leptonic radiation ) is explicitly gauge invariant and can be considered separately .",
    "similarly , the contribution from diagrams with a photon emitted from quark lines is called quarkonic radiation . in addition , there are also contributions from the interference of these two mechanisms",
    ". the emission of photons from leptons is described by pure qed and can be predicted with high reliability .",
    "therefore , the contributions from leptonic radiation will be suppressed by cuts on the photon emission angle @xcite . in our numerical evaluation",
    "we include the remaining background from leptonic radiation as well as the interference contribution .    at lowest order ,",
    "each parton is identified with a jet and the photon is automatically isolated from the quark jet by requiring a non - zero transverse momentum of the photon or jet in the @xmath37 center - of - mass frame . therefore the photon fragmentation is absent in this order .",
    "( 160,40 ) ( 31,-1 ) ( 91,-1 )    at next - to - leading order , processes with an additional gluon , either emitted into the final state or as incoming parton , have to be taken into account : @xmath38 @xmath39 where the momenta of the particles are again given in parentheses .",
    "examples of diagrams for @xmath40 and @xmath41 are shown in fig .",
    "in addition , virtual corrections ( one - loop diagrams at @xmath42 ) to the lo processes ( [ loprocess ] ) have to be included .",
    "the complete matrix elements for the processes ( [ hoprocess1 ] ) and ( [ hoprocess2 ] ) are given in @xcite .",
    "the processes ( [ hoprocess1 ] ) and ( [ hoprocess2 ] ) contribute both to the @xmath17-jet cross section , as well as to the cross section for @xmath18-jets in the final state . in the latter case",
    "each parton in the final state builds a jet on its own , whereas for @xmath43-jets a pair of final state partons is experimentally unresolved .",
    "the criteria for combining two partons into one jet will be introduced later .",
    "the contributions ( [ hoprocess1 ] ) and ( [ hoprocess2 ] ) as well as the virtual corrections to ( [ loprocess ] ) are of order @xmath44 .      ( 160,40 ) ( 31,-1 ) ( 91,-1 )    in addition to the direct production described in the last two subsections , photons can also be produced through the fragmentation of a hadronic jet into a single photon carrying a large fraction of the jet energy @xcite .",
    "this long - distance process is described in terms of quark - to - photon and gluon - to - photon fragmentation functions which absorb collinear singularities present in the nlo direct contributions of section 2.2 . the corresponding fragmentation processes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) are @xmath45 @xmath46 these processes are of order @xmath47 whereas the photon ff is formally of order @xmath48 , so that the lo fragmentation contribution is formally of order @xmath44 , i.e.  of the same order as the nlo direct contribution .",
    "the fragmentation photons , sometimes also called bremsstrahlung photons , are emitted predominantly along the direction of motion of the parent quark or gluon . because of the pointlike nature of the photon - quark interaction , it is possible to calculate the leading - logarithmic behaviour of the photon ff , including the corrections due to additional gluon emissions . the resulting ff s are in fact of order @xmath49 since they possess a logarithmic growth coming from the integration over the momenta of unobserved partons .",
    "therefore in the leading - logarithmic approximation the fragmentation contribution is obtained from @xmath49 ff s convoluted with corresponding @xmath50 cross sections for the two - body subprocesses ( [ fprocess1 ] ) and ( [ fprocess2 ] ) . the resulting contribution is thus of order @xmath30 , i.e.  of the same order as the lo non - fragmentation process ( [ loprocess ] ) .",
    "for this reason it is sometimes argued that the fragmentation contribution should be combined with the lo direct process to provide the full lo physical cross section .",
    "consequently , the calculation of the full cross section up to nlo would then also require the computation of the nlo corrections to the fragmentation contributions . on the other hand , it is well - known , that the fragmentation contribution in lo depends strongly on the factorization scale @xmath51 which , however , is cancelled to a large extent by the @xmath51-dependence of the nlo contribution to the non - fragmentation part . for this reason and also",
    "since for an isolated photon the fragmentation contribution is small we shall take it into account only in lo in the same way as in our previous work @xcite .",
    "the signature of the fragmentation contribution in lo is a photon balanced by a jet on the opposite side of the event and accompanied by nearly collinear hadrons on the same side of the event .",
    "this means that this contribution has a similar event structure as the lo direct contribution .",
    "the calculation of the nlo corrections was performed with the help of the phase space slicing method using a slicing parameter defined in terms of invariant masses . with this method",
    "it is straightforward to introduce the photon isolation requirement as well as to implement a jet definition which separates @xmath17-jet from @xmath20-jet final states .",
    "phase space slicing based on invariant masses is also used to separate the photon - quark collinearly singular regions , however , using another independent cutoff parameter .",
    "the technical steps to apply the phase space slicing method in the present case are described in the following .    in the calculation of the contribution to the @xmath17-jet cross section we encounter the",
    "well - known infrared singularities .",
    "they appear in those phase space regions where two partons are degenerate to one parton , i.e.  when the gluon becomes soft or two partons become collinear to each other .",
    "the singularities are assigned either to the initial state ( isr ) or to the final state ( fsr ) .",
    "contributions involving the product of an isr and a fsr factor are separated by partial fractioning .",
    "the fsr singularities cancel against singularities from virtual corrections to the lo process ( [ loprocess ] ) . for the isr singularities ,",
    "the cancellation is incomplete and the remaining singular contributions have to be factorized and absorbed into the renormalized pdf s of the proton .    to carry out these steps , the singularities are isolated in an analytic calculation using dimensional regularization .",
    "since the corresponding calculations are too difficult for the exact cross sections of the processes ( [ hoprocess1 ] ) and ( [ hoprocess2 ] ) an approximate solution is required . to achieve this",
    ", the phase space slicing @xcite is used first to separate the singular regions in the 4-particle phase space . then , in these regions the matrix elements are approximated by their most singular contributions . only for these approximate expressions and only in the singular regions the calculation",
    "is performed analytically .",
    "the separation of singular regions is obtained by applying a slicing cut @xmath52 to the scaled invariant masses @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and the mass of the hadronic final state @xmath55 is defined by @xmath56 .",
    "the cut @xmath52 must be chosen small enough so that terms of order @xmath57 which are neglected in the singular approximation are so small that an accuracy of a few per cent is achievable for the final result . outside the singular regions",
    "the integrations are done numerically without any approximation and with 4 space - time dimensions .",
    "physical cross sections , as defined in the next section , are obtained by adding the contributions from singular and non - singular regions as well as the virtual contributions and subtracting the remaining isr collinear singularities . in the final results , the dependence on the slicing parameter @xmath52 cancels .",
    "this means the cut - off @xmath52 is purely technical .",
    "the independence on the slicing cut @xmath52 has been checked by explicit calculation for some special photon plus jet cross sections in @xcite .",
    "further details and the derivation of the two - body matrix elements in the singular region together with the cancellation of the soft and collinear poles can be found in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the squared matrix elements for the processes ( [ hoprocess1 ] ) and ( [ hoprocess2 ] ) have photonic infrared and collinear singularities , i.e.  singularities due to soft or collinear photons .",
    "since we require the photon to be observed in the detector the infrared singularity can not occur .",
    "in the numerical analysis we will introduce this condition by requiring a minimum on the transverse momentum of the photon .",
    "this cut removes also all collinear singularities due to initial state radiation .",
    "final state collinear singularities due to photons are present and are treated again with the help of the phase space slicing method in a similar way as the quark - gluon collinear contributions .",
    "the phase space slicing parameter used to treat the photonic singularities can be chosen independently and is denoted by @xmath58 . as before , it has to be chosen very small so that the matrix element can be approximated by its singular part . for the subprocess ( [ hoprocess1 ] )",
    ", the phase space slicing is described by the squared invariant masses @xmath59 . in the gluon - initiated process ( [ hoprocess2 ] )",
    "one has two singular regions which are controlled by the variables @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively . in the regions @xmath60 , @xmath62 the cross section",
    "is evaluated numerically in the same way as in @xcite where these cuts were introduced as physical isolation cuts on the photon with sufficiently large isolation parameter @xmath58 . in this work",
    "the cuts on @xmath60 and @xmath61 are only technical since we include the contribution to the matrix element also in the regions @xmath63 and @xmath64 . in these regions",
    "the matrix elements are collinearly divergent .",
    "the singularities are regulated by dimensional regularization , allowing us to absorb their divergent parts into the bare photon ff to yield the renormalized photon ff denoted by @xmath65 . for the process ( [ hoprocess1 ] ) this procedure results in a contribution of the following form : @xmath66",
    "the matrix element @xmath67 on the right - hand side of ( [ m2frag ] ) is the matrix element for the process @xmath68 whose feynman diagram is shown in fig .  [ fig3]a .",
    "there exists a similar expression for the subprocess @xmath69 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) .",
    "the photon ff @xmath70 in ( [ m2frag ] ) is given by @xcite @xmath71 @xmath72 in ( [ dqg ] ) stands for the non - perturbative ff describing the transition @xmath73 at the factorization scale @xmath51 .",
    "this function will be specified in the next section . the second term in ( [ dqg ] ) ,",
    "if substituted in ( [ m2frag ] ) , is the finite part due to the collinear photon - quark ( -antiquark ) contribution to the matrix element @xmath74 integrated in the region @xmath63 after absorption of the divergent part into the non - perturbative ff .    again",
    "the parameter @xmath58 is only a parameter used in intermediate steps of the calculation , introduced to separate divergent from finite contributions ; the @xmath58-dependence in ( [ dqg ] ) is canceled by the dependence of the numerically computed @xmath43-jet cross section restricted to the region @xmath75 . since the corresponding contributions to the matrix element in ( [ m2frag ] ) are calculated in the collinear approximation , the result is valid only up to terms of order @xmath76 .",
    "this requires to choose a very small value for @xmath58 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been explicitly shown that the sum of all terms for the photon plus jet cross section becomes independent of @xmath58 when @xmath58 is chosen small enough .    in ( [ dqg ] ) , @xmath77 is the lo quark - to - photon splitting function @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the electric charge of quark @xmath80 .",
    "the variable @xmath81 denotes the fraction of the quark momentum carried away by the photon .",
    "if the photon is emitted from the final state quark with 4-momentum @xmath82 , then @xmath81 can be related to the invariants @xmath83 and @xmath84 : @xmath85 the fragmentation contribution is proportional to the cross section for @xmath68 which is @xmath86 and is well - known .",
    "it must be convoluted with the function in ( [ dqg ] ) to obtain the contribution to the cross section for @xmath87 at @xmath88 .",
    "equivalent formulas are used to calculate the fragmentation contributions to the channel ( [ hoprocess2 ] ) and in the case where the quarks in the initial and final state are replaced by an antiquark in ( [ hoprocess1 ] ) .",
