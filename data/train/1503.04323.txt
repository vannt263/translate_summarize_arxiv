    "leray also stated ( without proof ) the lower bound @xmath12 a proof of which can be found in giga ( 1986 ) and robinson & sadowski ( 2012 ) .",

    "( 2012 ) , the bound @xmath18 is what one would expect from scaling considerations for all @xmath14 ; we refer to this here as the ` optimal rate ' .",

    "has previously been shown .",
    "recently , cortissoz , montero , & pinilla ( 2014 ) proved lower bounds in @xmath3 and @xmath4 at the optimal rates but with logarithmic corrections , @xmath22 where in both cases @xmath23 depends on @xmath24 .    in this paper",
    "we fill some of these gaps .",
    "we will show that if @xmath0 is a smooth solution with maximal existence time @xmath2 then @xmath25 which we refer to as a ` strong blowup estimate ' , and @xmath26 which we refer to as a ` weak blowup estimate ' .",
    "we also prove a strong blowup estimate in the besov space @xmath5 , which has the same scaling as @xmath4 , @xmath27    the key to these bounds are two inequalities for the nonlinear term @xmath28 .",

    "the first is the sobolev space inequality @xmath29 valid whenever the right - hand side is finite ( in fact we prove a more general commutator - type estimate in proposition [ prop : nsinequalitynorm ] ) .",
    "the second is the besov bound @xmath30 where @xmath23 does not depend on @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
