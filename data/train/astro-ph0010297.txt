    "clusters of galaxies are the largest bound systems in the universe , and as such they are the largest objects where detailed studies of their gravitational potential are possible . given their large sizes , 3 to 6 mpc in extent , they are also thought to be representative of the universe in terms of the baryonic fraction which is directly related to the density of the universe and the predictions of the big bang nucleosynthesis theory .",

    "an alternative explanation for the results of allen ( 1998 ) could be that the cooling flow clusters are well modelled by a cluster potential similar to the type given by eqn .",
    "[ eq : pot ] , but non - cooling flow clusters have a different shape of gravitational potential , e.g. a mass profile that has a broad component in the outer parts of the cluster ( e.g. gioia et al . 1998 ) .",
    "it would be difficult for the hri to reject a model of this kind since it has a high background level and it would be easy to `` hide '' faint diffuse emission at large radii . in our study of abell  2104 , the current optical image does not extend to the extent of the x - ray emission , thus we need wide - field imaging to find out the true extent of the cluster .",
    "the x - ray emission in the centre of the cluster shows strong ellipticity , the effect such asphericity has on the mass estimates needs to be addressed since the mass estimates given above were calculated under the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "neumann & bhringer ( 1997 ) , estimated the effects of asphericity on mass estimates of cl0016 + 16 , and found that the total mass was only changed by @xmath162 when the ellipticity was taken into account .",
    "the ellipticity demonstrated in the x - ray image of is no stronger than that of cl0016 + 16 .",
    "so far we have only considered the isothermal gas models , but the total mass given by eqn .",
    "[ eq : hydro ] is more sensitive to @xmath47 than @xmath105 .",
    "it is necessary to explore models with a temperature gradient .",
    "markevitch et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found an almost universal decrease in temperature in the outer regions over a radius of 0.3 to 1.8 mpc in a sample of 30 nearby clusters ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "they found that for a typical 7 kev cluster , the observed temperature profile can be approximated by a polytropic equation of state with @xmath164 .",
    "if we assume that has a similar large scale temperature profile , then we can quantify the mass ratio between the polytropic and isothermal models as @xmath165 since the x - ray emissivity has only a weak dependence on @xmath47 over the 110 kev range ( only a 10% change ) , the x - ray surface brightness varies insignificantly with @xmath47 .",
    "we can then safely take the gas distribution as determined from the isothermal case ( i.e. eqn .",
    "[ eq : ne ] ) .",
    "thus at @xmath70 radius ( 1.46 mpc ) , a model with such a temperature gradient would give a mass that is @xmath166 times smaller than the isothermal case .",
    "this would cause the x - ray deduced mass to be strongly inconsistent with the dynamically deduced mass unless @xmath100 increases with radius in a similar manner as @xmath47 . note that a temperature profile that decreases with the radius would also increase the total mass in the inner cluster regions compared to the isothermal model , and thus alleviate the discrepancy between the x - ray mass within the arc radius and the position of the giant arc .",
    "[ f : mass ] shows the range of mass profiles deduced from the various methods and models discussed in the paper .",
    "the rich cluster at a redshift of @xmath167 was found to have a high x - ray luminosity ( @xmath168 ergs  s@xmath2 in [ 0.1 - 2.4 ] kev ) and temperature ( @xmath169 kev ) from _ rosat _ hri and _ asca _ data .",
    "the central cooling time , @xmath170yr for this cluster indicates the absence of a cooling flow .",
    "the galaxy velocity distribution showed that the cd galaxy was at rest at the bottom of the cluster potential .",
    "the x - ray image shows significant substructure in the centre of the cluster and an overall elliptical appearance .",
    "it appears that the cluster has not yet reached dynamical equilibrium .    as shown in evrard et al ( 1996 ) and schindler et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the total mass deduced from assumptions of dynamical equilibrium are not significantly different from the true values .",
    "the total mass deduced from the x - ray data assuming hydrostatic equilibrium is consistent with the dynamic mass deduced from jean s equation . however , the current data on the projected galaxy density distribution and our knowledge of the galaxy orbits are limited for studies of cluster dynamics , which allows a wide range of possible parametric functions for the spatial galaxy density distribution without even attempting the non - parametric methods of merritt and tremblay ( 1994 ) or considering any anisotropic orbits .",
    "this can be improved by a deep wide - field observation , to extend the galaxy number density distribution to a large radius ( up to 3 mpc ) and to allow a direct measure of the cluster mass from a weak shear analysis .",
    "this would allow us to definitively address the issue of whether or not the cluster is in dynamical equilibrium and constrain the range of possible total mass distributions allowed by the wide - range of data from lensing effects to x - rays .",
    "in order not to bias the results and incorporate a wide - range of the possible total mass density distributions , a non - parametric method should also be employed . with the launch of xmm and chandra , we will soon able to obtain a temperature profile and probe the x - ray emission at the edge of the cluster which is crucial to the improvement of the x - ray mass estimates .",
