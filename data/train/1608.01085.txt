    "our aim is to represent bilinear hirota - type differential operators of the form @xmath2 which satisfy gauge condition for some fixed @xmath3 : @xmath4 where @xmath5 are smooth complex - valued functions , @xmath6 and @xmath3 has perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath7 : @xmath8 let @xmath9 , so when @xmath10 , @xmath11 coincides with the ordinary hirota derivative @xcite ( it is uniquely defined using gauge condition ) .",
    "we claim that such operators can be used as building blocks for some interesting equations ( relations with @xmath0-schur functions are mostly conjectured , see @xcite for more reference ) .",
    "of course , it can be generalized to multi - linear multi - dimensional case ( although there may me some obstacles , and we ll show this later ) .",
    "`` good '' choice of gauge function @xmath3 ( a proper sum of @xmath0-exponentials ) can lead to non - trivial properties .",
    "one of our goals is to understand the structure of bilinear operators of the type @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a quasi - homogeneous polynomial ( monomials are labeled by partitions of @xmath14 ) with @xmath0-deformed coefficients .",
    "we add @xmath15 as lower index to emphasise dependence on a gauge .",
    "before producing the general construction , consider the following example . choose @xmath16 as the @xmath0-exponential : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a @xmath0-shifted factorial @xmath19 recall definitoin of @xmath0-derivative : @xmath20 consider the following @xmath0-difference operator : @xmath21 it can be checked that ( [ dq ] ) does not satisfy gauge condition ( opposite to its differential limit ) .",
    "now substitute @xmath22 in ( [ q - exp ] ) and expand in powers of @xmath23 : @xmath24 we also rewrite ( [ ddef ] ) as @xmath23-series : @xmath25 where @xmath26 are ( to be found ) bilinear differential operators with polynomial coefficients .",
    "consider that the following gauge property holds : @xmath27 it follows that @xmath26 should satisfy the functional equation : @xmath28 we choose initial condition : @xmath29 now our coefficients can be written as @xmath30 so we can compare @xmath11 with @xmath31 expansion !",
    "the first few coefficients are    [ cols= \" > , < \" , ]     note that @xmath32 solution for @xmath33 in explicit form : @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37(f_1,f_2)+r_8d^0(f_1',f_2')\\ ] ] where @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , @xmath40  complex constants .",
    "remarkable fact is that @xmath41 satisfy the following equation : @xmath42 we conjecture that similar equalities should hold for any @xmath43 .",
    "now we are ready to represent the general formula .",
    "* thm.2 * _ gauge operators @xmath44 are expressed as follows : _",
    "@xmath45 @xmath46 note here",
    "that for odd powers @xmath47 , which is not true for ordinary @xmath48 s .",
    "let @xmath3 be a series of certain combinatorial nature .",
    "as an example , we consider hurwitz - kontsevich genetaring function @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the cut - and - join operator : @xmath51 now take @xmath52 , where @xmath53  hurwitz partition function .",
    "its first few terms are : + @xmath54 + @xmath55 @xmath56 + then we have : @xmath57 where @xmath58 , and the coefficient @xmath59 in these formulas @xmath60 are expressed in terms of logarithmic derivative of hurwitz - kontsevich function and its derivatives .",
    "now we can check that for the following commutatuor @xmath61 , \\quad m , n \\ \\mathrm{even}\\ ] ] all coefficients also depend on @xmath62 in a non - trivial way .",
    "we conjecture that , using this formalism , one can rediscover identities for hurwitz function .",
    "also note that if @xmath3 is a non - trivial tau - function itself , then @xmath63 degenerates to some kp - like equation , while @xmath64 corresponds to its minor deformation .",
