    "sexual reproduction is the observed mode of reproduction for nearly all multicellular organisms . as such",
    ", the evolution of sex has been one of the central outstanding questions in evolutionary biology .",
    "one of the biological explanations for the existence of sex is that it provides a natural mechanism for diploid organisms to eliminate deleterious mutations from a population @xcite .",
    "the idea is that , by reproducing via a haploid intermediate , it is possible for haploids without defective genes to recombine with one another , thereby preventing the accumulation of deleterious mutations .",
    "other explanations that have been advanced are that sex leads to greater variability in a population , making the population more adaptable in adverse conditions .",
    "it has also been postulated that sex evolved as a mechanism for coping with parasites @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", there have been a number of numerical studies focusing on the evolutionary dynamics of sexual replication @xcite .",
    "these studies have established that , depending on the choice of parameters , either sexual or asexual modes of reproduction are the advantageous replication strategy .",
    "one study in particular argues that sexual reproduction is favored when the number of daughter genomes produced by the parents is high , since this reduces the amount of time required to find a reproductive partner @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present a relatively simple evolutionary dynamics model that allows us to compare sexual and asexual replication strategies .",
    "the model is analytically solvable , and treatable within the quasispecies formalism @xcite .",
    "the essential result is that sexual replication is favored in populations with low replication rates , and when the characteristic time associated with finding a reproductive partner is small compared with the time scale associated with replication .",
    "these results suggest that increasing population density favors the sexual replication strategy , since it reduces the time scale associated with finding a mate .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the following section ( section ii ) , we develop a simplified model for sexual replication , whose steady - state behavior we proceed to characterize in section iii . in section",
    "iv we compare sexual and asexual replication , and establish regimes where each is the preferred mode of reproduction .",
    "we conclude the paper in section v with a brief discussion and an outline of avenues for future research .",
    "in a simplified model for sexual replication , we assume that we have a population of single - celled organisms , where each organism has a genome consisting of two chromosomes .",
    "we assume that each chromosome may be denoted by a linear symbol sequence @xmath2 , where each letter , or base , @xmath3 , is chosen from an alphabet of size @xmath4 ( @xmath5 for terrestrial life ) .",
    "we further assume that there exists a `` master '' sequence @xmath6 for which a given chromosome is functional .",
    "it is assumed that a chromosome is nonfunctional whenever @xmath7 ( that is , the genes on such a chromosome are defective ) .    within this approximation , there are three distinct types of genomes in the population : ( 1 ) @xmath8  genomes where both chromosomes are identical to the `` master '' sequence .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath9  genomes where only one of the chromosomes is identical to the `` master '' sequence , while the other chromosome is defective . ( 3 ) @xmath10  genomes where both of the chromosomes are defective .",
    "we are therefore dealing with a diploid population .",
    "if we assign the gene sequence @xmath6 as _ viable _ , while all other gene sequences are _ unviable _ , then our three genome types may be classified as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 stand for viable / unviable .",
    "we assume that the organisms replicate with a first - order growth rate constant .",
    "for the three distinct genome types , the first - order growth rate constants are taken to be @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "we have that @xmath18 .",
    "the sexual replication of the population occurs as follows : the diploid organisms divide to form a population of haploid organisms .",
    "it is assumed that those haploid organisms containing a genome of type u are incapable of participating further in the reproductive process , so that only viable haploids can recombine with each other .",
    "the newly formed diploids then divide via the normal mitotic pathways to form two new daughter cells .    to develop a set of ordinary differential equations governing the replication dynamics described above , we first let @xmath19 denote the total number of organisms with genome of type @xmath11 , @xmath20 denote the total number of organisms with genome of type @xmath12 , and @xmath21 denote the total number of organisms with genome of type @xmath13 .",
    "we also let @xmath22 denote the population of viable haploids .",
    "we then wish to obtain expressions for @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "first note that , the diploid to haploid division leads to destruction of each of the diploid genomes at a rate given by @xmath27 for @xmath11 , and similarly for the other genomes , and a creation of viable haploid genomes at a rate given by @xmath28 .",
    "if we let @xmath0 denote the average amount of time a viable haploid spends searching for a viable haploid mate , then in a given amount of time @xmath29 the total number of viable haploids who have recombined is given by @xmath30 ( the individual times are poisson distributed ) .",
    "therefore , recombination leads to a destruction rate of haploids given by @xmath31 , and a creation rate of diploids given by @xmath32 .",
    "if we let @xmath33 denote the probability of correctly replicating a chromosome , then neglecting backmutations we have that @xmath34 with probability @xmath33 , @xmath35 with probability @xmath36 , and @xmath37 with probability @xmath38",
    ". using this , we can construct the various possible replication pathways and their associated probabilities , illustrated in figure 2 . from these pathways",
    ", we can construct the contribution to @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 in turn .    for @xmath19 , all three replication pathways in figure 1 give a contribution .",
    "taking into account probabilities and degeneracies , we have a total contribution of @xmath39 from the first pathway , @xmath40 from the second pathway , and @xmath41 from the second pathway , giving a total rate of production of @xmath42 = ( 1/4 ) n_v/\\tau_{seek } ( 1 + p)^2 $ ] .    for @xmath20 , similar reasoning gives a rate of production of @xmath43 = ( 1/2 ) n_v\\tau_{seek }",

    ", we obtain @xmath44 .    putting everything together",
    ", we obtain the system of differential equations , @xmath45    we can non - dimensionalize these equations by defining @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",

    "this is important , because , in comparing mean fitness results with an asexually replicating population , the natural mean fitness result to use is @xmath76 .",
    "the equivalence between @xmath75 and @xmath76 means that we can compute @xmath75 at steady - state and compare the results directly with the value of @xmath75 for the asexually replicating population .    plugging the steady - state value of @xmath70 into the steady - state equations for @xmath67 and @xmath68 , we obtain , @xmath77 x_{vv }   \\nonumber \\\\ &    & + \\frac{1}{4 } ( 1 + p)^2 \\frac{\\tilde{\\kappa}_{vu } x_{vu}}{1 + \\bar{\\kappa}(\\tau = \\infty ) } \\nonumber \\\\ &    & 0 = [ \\tilde{\\kappa}_{vu } ( \\frac{1}{2 } ( 1 - p^2 ) \\frac{1}{1 + \\bar{\\kappa}(\\tau = \\infty ) } - 1 ) - \\bar{\\kappa}(\\tau = \\infty ) ] x_{vu } \\nonumber \\\\ &    & + ( 1 - p^2 ) \\frac{1}{1 + \\bar{\\kappa}(\\tau ) } \\tilde{\\kappa}_{vv } x_{vv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can solve the first equation for @xmath68 in terms of @xmath67 . plugging the resulting expression into the second equation ,",
    "we obtain , after some algebra , the quadratic , @xmath78 \\bar{\\kappa}(\\tau = \\infty ) \\nonumber \\\\ &    & - \\tilde{\\kappa}_{vv } ' \\tilde{\\kappa}_{vu } ' p\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "we can further simplify the notation by defining @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",

    "if , for simplicity , we assume that @xmath87 , then for asexual replication the steady - state value for @xmath83 may be readily characterized @xcite : it is given by @xmath88 . therefore , if @xmath89 is defined by the equality @xmath90 , then , @xmath91 $ }",

    "asexual replication is also advantageous over sexual replication at low mutation rates . as with the previous regime",
    ", there is a crossover replication fidelity where sexual replication becomes advantageous .",
    "however , in contrast to the first @xmath130 regime , there is a second crossover replication fidelity where asexual replication again becomes advantageous .",
    "for these values of @xmath130 , the cost associated with sex is still sufficiently low that sexual replication can become the advantageous strategy at higher mutation rates .",
    "however , the cost of sex is sufficiently high that , at even higher mutation rates , sexual recombination no longer offsets the production of unviable chromosomes from viable ones to an extent that makes the strategy advantageous .",
    "finally , for @xmath194 , the cost associated with sex is so high that sexual replication is never the advantageous strategy .    as a final note for this subsection",

    "when @xmath212 , the results for sexual replication remain unchanged .",
    "however , the results for asexual replication change somewhat , since now an additional localization to delocalization transition can occur , once @xmath213 .",
    "it is therefore possible to have a situation where sexual replication only becomes advantageous once the mean fitness of an asexually replicating population is @xmath17 . with an appropriate choice of parameters",
    ", it is then possible that the mean fitness of the sexually replicating population is less than @xmath17 , so that sexual replication will never be the preferred replication strategy .",
    "we leave the investigation of this phenomenon for future work .    in any event , for @xmath212 , asexual replication will become the advantageous mode of replication at sufficiently high mutation rates , since the mean fitness of the sexually replicating population decreases to zero , while after complete delocalization over the genome space has occurred , the mean fitness of the asexually replicating population becomes @xmath17 .",
    "this result , however , is likely due to a mating strategy that essentially `` throws away '' the `` u '' chromosomes .",
    "other mating strategies , where all haploids are capable of mating , may not exhibit the same effect .",
    "this paper developed a simplified model for sexual replication , and showed , within the context of the model , that a sexually replicating population will outcompete an asexually replicating one when there there is no cost associated with sex .",
    "we further showed that if the cost associated with sex is sufficiently low , then sexual replication becomes advantageous at higher mutation rates , because recombination prevents the accumulation of defective mutations in the diploid genomes ( assuming that there is a fitness penalty associated with the defective mutations ) .",
    "the cost for sex was measured by the dimensionless parameter @xmath130 , defined to be the product of the first - order growth rate constant of the mutation - free genomes ( @xmath15 ) , and the characteristic time associated with finding a recombination partner ( @xmath0 ) . since @xmath214 , where @xmath215 denotes a characteristic replication time",
    ", it follows that @xmath216 .",
    "therefore , the cost associated with sex is measured by the ratio of the time a haploid spends finding a recombination partner with the time scale for replication",
    ". the smaller this ratio , the smaller the fitness penalty incurred by reproducing via a haploid intermediate , and the greater the selective advantage for sex .",
    "the implications of this model are that sexual replication is favored in environments where organisms replicate relatively slowly , and in environments where the time spent finding a recombination partner is small compared with the time scale for replication .",
    "thus , sexual replication is favored in environments with high population density .",
    "these results are therefore consistent with the observation that sexual replication is the preferred ( and generally the only ) mode of reproduction for nearly all multicellular organisms .    that sexual replication only becomes the preferred mode of reproduction at low @xmath130 suggests why sexual replication occurs as a stress response in some organisms , such as _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ ( baker s yeast ) . when conditions are favorable , @xmath15 , and hence @xmath130 , are relatively high , so asexual replication is the advantageous strategy . under sufficiently adverse conditions",
    ", @xmath130 can drop to levels where the sexual strategy becomes advantageous .",
    "the replicative strategy that can adopt the optimal replication strategy for the given environment will have a selective advantage ( assuming that resource costs for maintaining this switching behavior are not prohibitive ) , and so organisms carrying this strategy in their genomes will dominate the population .    however , as one moves toward more complex life forms , the replication rate drops to values such that asexual replication is almost never the preferred mode of reproduction , so that the ability for an organism to switch between the two modes of reproduction disappears . at this point",
    ", we postulate that the division of haploid cells into two distinct types of gametes , and then later the division of the organisms themselves into male and female , are the result of selection for evolutionary pathways leading to the division of labor and specialization of tasks associated with sexual replication . when replication rates are low , and when the time cost associated with sex is low , then it is likely more efficient ( in terms of resource utilization ) to divide the reproductive tasks associated with sexual replication among two types of organisms ( `` male '' and `` female '' )",
    ". the relative fitness advantage as a result of such savings in resource costs likely increases with the complexity of the organism , leading to a stronger selection pressure for a male - female split as organismal complexity grows .    in this paper , we assumed that only haploid cells with viable chromosomes are capable of engaging in sexual recombination .",
    "this allowed a simplified analysis within the standard quasispecies formalism .",
    "while we obtained a selective advantage for sexual replication using this mating strategy , a fuller analysis will require the consideration of various mating strategies on the selective advantage for sex .",
    "an important such mating strategy , which is the opposite of the one considered in this paper , is the random mating strategy , whereby all haploids are capable of engaging in sexual recombination , and do so with a pairwise distribution given by the hardy - weinberg equilibrium .    in this vein",
    ", one interesting question is to determine , for a given fitness landscape , whether there always exists a mating strategy for which sexual replication will outcompete asexual replication .",
    "additionally , while this paper implicitly assumed that the strategy for sexual or asexual replication is inherited , future studies should consider genomes where genes for sex are explicitly included .",
    "this leads to the ability for sexual organisms to mutate into asexual ones .",
    "as the selective advantage for sexual replication disappears ( as a function of mutation rate , for instance ) , the models may exhibit localization to delocalization transitions over the portions of the genome controlling sex ."
