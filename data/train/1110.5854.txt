    "<S> a natural question is how such a background modifies three - body physics . </S>",
    "<S> here we demonstrate how the generic problem of three interacting particles changes when one of the particles is embedded in a background fermi sea . </S>",

    "<S> while much effort was put into detecting these universal bound states within nuclear and molecular physics , the search has been unsuccesful so far @xcite . only with the emergence of ultracold atomic gases and experimental control of the two - body interaction,@xcite was the prediction of efimov finally observed in cold gases of alkali atoms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observations showed that one indeed finds a universal geometric scaling law for the three - body states . </S>",
    "<S> this law states that an infinite tower of three - body bound states exist and that the energy is smaller by a factor of @xmath0 , as one moves from one state to the next , approaching zero energy . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the observation of such states is extremely difficult , highlighting the enormous achievement of the ultracold gas experiments of recent years .    from the original idea of cooper pairs </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , that are an essential ingredient in the famous bardeen - cooper - schrieffer theory of superconductivity @xcite , it is clear that few - body properties can be strongly influenced by a many - body background . in that case </S>",

    "<S> a natural question that appears in this context is whether this binding and the macroscopic coherence of the pairs in general can survive if we start to polarize the system , i.e. change the size of the fermi sea for one of the electronic spin states but not the other . </S>",

    "<S> in ultracold atomic gases , the spin components are mimicked by internal hyperfine states whose relative population can be adjusted freely , and experiments have provided numerous insights into the interplay between the two - body problem and many - body physics @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> we address the question of what happens when one merges three - body physics and the efimov effect with a many - body background . </S>",

    "<S> as we will now discuss , the universal scaling laws , originally obtained by efimov , hold also in the presence of a fermi sea . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find a new scaling law related to the background fermi energy , which may be interpreted as a many - body scaling for the three - body bound states . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that the efimov effect is robust in a many - body background . </S>",
    "<S> we consider first the generic problem of efimov ; three particles interacting with the same two - body interaction which is characterized by the scattering length , @xmath1 , in the universal regime ( @xmath2 with @xmath3 the characteristic potential range ) . </S>",
    "<S> afterwards , we discuss the three - body bound states in the three - component @xmath4li system that has been recently realized @xcite . for the latter system , we expect our findings to be accessible at or slightly above the densities of current experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> our approach to the problem of three - body states in the presence of a background fermi sea uses the momentum - space equations orginally formulated by skorniakov and ter - martirosian ( stm ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the case where one of the three particles forming the bound state has a fermi sea with fermi wave number , @xmath5 , in the limit of an inert sea with no particle - hole pairs . </S>",
    "<S> we will address the consequences of this approximation and also the case of multiple fermi seas below . </S>",

    "<S> the spectrum for @xmath7 as function of @xmath5 was obtained using a semi - classical approximation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our approach using the stm equation is , however , completely general and will work for any choice of masses and any value of the interaction strengths .    in the presence of a fermi sea , the two - body dimer threshold moves from @xmath7 to the @xmath8 side of the two - body scattering resonance @xcite as seen in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> it is natural to speculate that the three - body bound states threshold with the continuum will also be moved as function of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we indeed confirm this expectation , and find that the states move in a fashion that respects the original scaling found by efimov . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ spec]b we have chosen a value of @xmath5 such that a bound three - body state merges with the three - body continuum at zero energy for @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this is perhaps puzzling since in the case of a single fermi sea , a dimer could be formed between the two particles that do not have a background . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find numerically that the three - body state is well - defined in this region , i.e. the three - body energy has a vanishingly small imaginary part , and pauli blocking thus seems to stabilize the system from decay into a dimer and an atom .    </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath5 values for which an efimov trimer threshold crosses resonance ( nearly vertical jumps in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ spec]c ) are given by the universal relation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a non - universal constant that sets the overall scale . </S>",
    "<S> recall that this relation connects a feature of the background , @xmath5 , and a feature of the universal , vacuum three - body system , @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> considering that pauli blocking should influence low - momentum states , while the scaling laws are derived from the high - momentum behaviour @xcite , our results are highly non - trivial . </S>",
    "<S> the derivation will in fact be hindered by an obstructing term at low momentum , and the recovery of the scaling form is not obvious . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling with @xmath5 is also found for the points at which the trimer merges with the atom - dimer continuum as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ spec]c . when considering either the ratios of the trimer energies on resonance ( where efimov originally found the infinite tower of universal states ) , or for the critical scattering length at which the trimers merge with the atom - dimer continuum at non - zero three - body energy ( the black dots in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ spec]b ) we again find the same behavior when varying @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> while the results presented here have assumed equal mass particles , we find the same behavior for different masses when @xmath16 is changed accordingly . </S>",
    "<S> we address the advantages of using different mass ratios below .    above </S>",
    "<S> we assume an inert fermi sea . </S>",

    "<S> when interactions are present one must in general consider the effects of exciting particle - hole pairs in the fermi sea . in principle , this can be done in a self - consistent manner through dressed particle - hole propagators which is numerically very difficult . </S>",
    "<S> the stm formalism is , however , completely general and one can take corrections to the inert sea into account order by order . to estimate these effects , we have used a @xmath5-dependent effective scattering length that includes effects of particle - hole pairs to lowest non - trivial order @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> what we find is that while the positions of thresholds will move , the scaling law discussed above remains the same . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly suggests that our findings are robust when including particle - hole correlations . </S>",
    "<S> we caution that such an approach is expected to break down on the bec side of the resonance where strongly bound dimers are present in the system . </S>",
