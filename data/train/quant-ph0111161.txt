    "the interaction of a single mode of the electromagnetic field with a single atom has long been at the forefront of interest within the quantum optics community . in this context , the jaynes - cummings model  @xcite and its extensions have been the main focus of attention , for several reasons .",
    "it is the simplest possible model , involving a single two - level atom interacting with a quantized field mode , and therefore is in many cases exactly solvable .",
    "it has also proven to be experimentally realizable , thus allowing direct comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "this line of research has deepened immensely our understanding of fundamental quantum phenomena , and continues to do so .    experimentally , the field of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed )  @xcite has been shown to be very promising for further studies of fundamental quantum systems .",
    "recent advances in mirror manufacturing techniques make it possible to build high - finesse microcavities in which the coupling strength of an atomic transition to a cavity field mode can be an order of magnitude larger than the decoherence rates of the system  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , four spectacular experiments have recently demonstrated that it is possible to trap a single atom within a microscopic cavity using either an independent atomic trap  @xcite , or the field mode itself , containing not more than one photon at a time  @xcite .    within the framework of cqed ,",
    "the regime of strong atom - field coupling is interesting for many reasons .",
    "for one , it enables the study of strongly coupled quantum systems ; in particular , the ` atom - cavity molecule '  @xcite . secondly , it is also a very promising candidate for the realization of strong optical nonlinearities  @xcite .",
    "for example , an approximation to a @xmath0 ( kerr ) nonlinear optical system can be achieved using either a single , strongly coupled two - level atom , or an ensemble of weakly coupled two - level atoms .",
    "however , the large atom - field detuning , which minimizes atomic spontaneous emission noise , also minimizes the strength of the nonlinearity . using the kerr - type nonlinearities produced by a single two - level atom in a cavity ,",

    "neither of these simplifications is possible .",
    "the ` atom - field molecule ' must be truly regarded as a fundamental entity , which exhibits features that can not be explained in terms of individual properties of its constituents .",

    "have refined the analysis of the corresponding ` slow polaritons ' , and showed that it is possible to reverse a stopped polariton by reversing the control beam .",
    "however , none of the treatments so far have dealt with the coupled atom - cavity system .    in section  [ sec :",

    "in section  [ sec : dress ] we diagonalise the interaction hamiltonian exactly to find a set of basis states for subsequent analysis . in section  [ sec : drivdamp ] , the driving term and damping terms are expressed in terms of the new basis set , and the effective hamiltonian in the polariton representation is found . in section  [ sec : dynstark ] we apply our results to obtain expressions for the dynamic stark splitting and the spectrum of weak excitations in the effective two - level system . in section",

    "@xmath100 clearly takes a block - diagonal form in the dressed state representation , as the operator expansion  ( [ eq : dampops ] ) includes terms containing every possible dressed level within a given manifold .",
    "the diagonal terms correspond to damping of the dressed states due to their decay straight into the reservoir . off - diagonal terms couple two different dressed levels in a given manifold .",
    "this coupling arises due to couplings of both levels to the same reservoir level .",
    "if each of these diagonal blocks is again diagonalized , in the presence of damping we get shifts appearing on each level .",
    "the complex eigenvalues add their real part to the energy shift and the imaginary part becomes the damping rate .",

    "each of the collapse operators can then be expressed in terms of polariton operators , and a new set of collapse operators @xmath114 can be obtained .",
    "note that the effective master equation resulting from the polariton expansion will contain cross terms in the collapse operators , giving damping terms of the form @xmath115 .",
    "these cross terms have a very important role in modifying the emission rate from the polariton states to the reservoir .",
    "such terms have been studied and well understood for the case of the modification of spontaneous emission in multilevel atoms  @xcite .",
    "it was proven earlier  @xcite that the eit - kerr system can behave as an effective two - level system , with the states @xmath116 and @xmath55 being its ground and excited states .",

    "the tiny asymmetry between the position of the positive frequency peaks and negative frequency peaks arises from the fact that the polariton states are asymmetrically detuned from the cavity resonance .",

    "the regime of strong coupling cqed presents a difficult problem for analytical calculation , as well as for the understanding of the physics involved .",
    "we have shown that consistent application of the polariton approach can offer a significant insight and even enable a relatively simple analytical treatment of the physical problem . in particular , the problem of an externally driven atom / quantum field system has been reduced to the problem of composite excitations , transitions between which are effectively driven by classical fields of rabi frequencies @xmath91 , which were calculated exactly .",
    "the polariton approach can be interpreted as a change of basis in hilbert space .",
    "it is obvious that such a change can in general simplify the analysis of the problem .",
    "the reason for this is that in the dressed state basis the number of degrees of freedom can be significantly reduced , compared to the treatment in terms of the bare states .",
    "for example , if the atom has @xmath179 levels ( degrees of freedom ) , and quantum field mode can be safely truncated at some number @xmath180 , the problem in the bare state basis has a dimension of at least @xmath181 . in the dressed state basis , we can identify which @xmath182 dressed states ( and associated polaritons ) participate in the dynamics , effectively reducing the dimension of the problem to @xmath183 .",
    "the treatment of dynamic stark splitting in section  [ sec : dynstark ] provided a simple but extremely successful example of such reduction . in other words , from all of the ( infinite number of ) dimensions of hilbert space , the polariton approach lets us pinpoint those few dimensions that are predominantly involved in the system dynamics .",
    "of course , this approach does not guarantee that the reduced problem will be analytically solvable .",
    "there are some general limits on solvability in the dressed state basis .",
    "for example , if the number of atomic levels @xmath184 , the diagonalisation of the interaction hamiltonian is impossible _ in principle _",
    ", except perhaps in some special cases , since @xmath179 determines the order of the polynomial of the eigenvalue problem . also , the size of the reduced problem @xmath182 can still be impractically large .",
    "while nothing much can be done about the first problem , for the second one , we foresee ways to simplify the involved numerics . in particular , the coupled amplitudes approach and the effective master equation look promising . we are pursuing this avenue at the moment , and will publish our findings elsewhere .",
