    "the phase diagram of boron carbide is not precisely known , with both qualitative and quantitative discrepancies among the different research groups  @xcite .",
    "the most widely accepted diagram of schwetz  @xcite displays a single boron carbide phase at temperature above 1000c , coexisting with elemental boron and graphite .",
    "the carbon concentration covers the range 9@xmath6 - 19.2@xmath6 carbon , falling notably short of the 20% carbon fraction at which the electron count is believed to be optimal  @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , the nearly temperature independent behavior of the phase boundaries are thermodynamically improbable , and the broad composition range suggests substitutional disorder at 0k , in apparent violation of the 3rd law . since so much remains unknown , and experiment can only be assured of reaching equilibrium at high temperature , theoretical calculation offers hope for resolving the behavior at lower temperatures , in addition to interpreting the disorder at high temperatures .",
    "as determined crystallographically @xcite , boron carbide has a 15-atom primitive cell , consisting of an icosahedron and 3-atom chain , in a rhombohedral lattice with symmetry @xmath0 . at 20@xmath6 carbon",
    "a proposed b@xmath7c structure featured pure boron icosahedra b@xmath8 with a c - c - c chain  @xcite .",
    "although this structure exhibits @xmath0 symmetry , later experimental work @xcite suggested that the icosahedron should be b@xmath2c instead of b@xmath8 and the chain should be c - b - c instead of c - c - c .",
    "for other compositions , the icosahedra can be b@xmath8 , b@xmath2c , or even b@xmath9c@xmath10 ( the bi - polar defect  @xcite ) , and the chain can be c - b - c , c - b - b , b - b@xmath10-b  @xcite or b - v - b ( v means vacancy ) .",
    "[ fig : structure ] illustrates the rhombohedral cell , the c - b - c chain and the icosahedron .",
    "the 12 icosahedral sites are categorized into 2 classes : equatorial and polar .",
    "we further classify the polar sites into north and south .",
    "icosahedra are connected along edges of the rhombohedral lattice , which pass through the polar sites .    0.5 cm , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , while the south polar sites are shown in cyan and labeled as @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15.,title=\"fig : \" ]    density functional theory studies of a large number of possible arrangements of boron and carbon atoms  @xcite identified four stable phases : pure @xmath16-boron , rhombohedral b@xmath17c@xmath10 , monoclinic b@xmath7c , and graphite .",
    "the stable rhombohedral phase consists of b@xmath8 icosahedra with c - b - c chains , giving full rhombohedral symmetry @xmath0 , while the stable monoclinic phase has b@xmath18 icosahedra and c - b - c chains .",
    "carbon occupies the same polar site ( e.g. @xmath19 ) in every icosahedron , resulting in symmetry @xmath1 . introducing disorder in the occupation of polar sites ( i.e. randomly choosing one polar site to occupy with carbon ) can restore @xmath0 symmetry . in general , we define site occupations @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) corresponding to the mean occupation of the sites @xmath22 .",
    "the experimentally observed phase has all @xmath23 .",
    "we call this orientational disorder .",
    "the the stable monoclinic phase has one large order parameter ( e.g. @xmath24 ) and the remaining @xmath25 , which we call orientational order .",
    "hence it was proposed  @xcite that a temperature - driven order - disorder phase transition is responsible for the high symmetry seen in experiments that are likely in equilibrium only at high temperature .    according to landau s theory of phase transitions  @xcite",
    ", the space groups of structures linked by continuous or at most weakly first order phase transitions should obey group - subgroup relationships .",
    "additionally , the subgroup should be maximal , again provided the transition is continuous or at most weakly first order . typically the high temperature phase possesses the higher symmetry , as this permits a higher entropy . in regard to boron carbide , the high temperature phase has space group @xmath0 ( group # 166 ) and the low temperature phase has group @xmath1 ( group # 8) .",
    "however , @xmath1 is not a maximal subgroup of @xmath0 , suggesting the possible existence of an intermediate phase .",
    "two sequences of transitions obey the maximality requirement : @xmath26 and @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "the two corresponding intermediate symmetries @xmath5 and @xmath28 have space group numbers # 160 and # 12 , respectively .    in terms of the distribution of carbon atoms on icosahedra , @xmath5 breaks the inversion symmetry , and hence corresponds to occupying one pole ( e.g. the north pole ) more heavily than the other , so that @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) with the remaining @xmath25 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath28 breaks the 3-fold rotational symmetry but preserves inversion .",
    "thus the carbon atoms preferentially occupy a pair of diametrically opposite polar sites , e.g. @xmath31 while the remaining @xmath25 .    since the carbon atom draws charge from surrounding borons , the phases that break inversion symmetry possess an electric dipole moment .",
    "hence we name the @xmath5 state `` polar '' .",
    "the possibility of a polar phase was independently suggested recently  @xcite .",
    "we name the @xmath1 state `` tilted polar '' because the broken 3-fold symmetry creates a component of polarization in the @xmath32 plane .",
    "although it lacks a net dipole moment , we name the @xmath28 state `` bipolar '' because it is reminiscent of the bipolar defect  @xcite .",
    "finally , we name the the high symmetry phase @xmath0 `` nonpolar '' .    to identify phase transitions , and to determine which symmetry - breaking sequence occurs , we perform monte carlo simulations . strictly speaking ,",
    "phase transitions occur only in the thermodynamic limit of large system size , which is beyond the reach of density functional theory calculations .",
    "hence we construct a classical interatomic interaction model , with parameters fit to density functional theory energies . for simplicity",
    "we consider only the high carbon limit where every icosahedron contains a single polar carbon ( i.e. we essentially project the composition range onto the @xmath33 line ) .",
    "we analyze our simulation results with the aid of the multiple histogram technique  @xcite . in the end",
    "we indeed discover a sequence of two phase transitions .",
    "one arises from the breaking of 3-fold symmetry linking @xmath1 to @xmath5 that is first order , similar to the 3-state potts model  @xcite in three dimensions .",
    "the other corresponds to the breaking of inversion symmetry linking @xmath5 to @xmath0 that is in the ising universality class .",
    "given that every primitive cell contains a b@xmath2c@xmath3 icosahedron and a c - b - c chain , the configuration can be uniquely specified by assigning a 6-state variable @xmath34 to each cell , corresponding to which of the six polar sites holds the carbon atom . the relaxed total energy of a specific configuration can be expressed through a cluster expansion in terms of pairwise , triplet and higher - order interactions  @xcite of these variables . as shown below",
    ", truncating at the level of pair interactions provides sufficient accuracy for present purposes .",
    "further , we observe that symmetry - inequivalent pairs are in nearly one - to - one correspondence with the inter - carbon separation @xmath35 where the @xmath36 are the initial positions prior to relaxation and belong to a discrete set of fixed possible values @xmath37 , arranged in order of increasing length .",
    "note that we need not concern ourselves with interactions of polar carbons with chain carbons , as the number of such pairwise interactions is conserved across configurations .",
    "thus our total energy can be expressed as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of intercarbon separations of length @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the number of such separations we choose to treat in our model .",
    "we use the density functional theory - based vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp )  @xcite to calculate the total energies within the projector augmented wave ( paw )  @xcite method utilizing the pbe generalized gradient approximation  @xcite as the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "we construct a variety of 2x2x2 and 3x3x3 supercells , which we relax with increasing @xmath42-point meshes until convergence is reached at the level of 0.1 mev / atom , holding the plane - wave energy cutoff fixed at 400 ev .",
