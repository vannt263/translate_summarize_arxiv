    "when the kagome lattice was introduced , it was shown that the antiferromagnetic ising model on this lattice does not order.@xcite until today , the kagome lattice remains a classic problem in highly frustrated magnetism.@xcite one of the open problems concerns the physics of the spin-1/2 heisenberg model on the kagome lattice in zero field , where despite several numerical@xcite and variational studies,@xcite the situation is still not fully understood .",
    "the most recent dmrg studies point towards a translationally invariant spin liquid state @xcite with no apparent broken symmetries , a gap to triplet excitations of order @xmath4 and short - range spin correlations .",
    "this state is consistent with a resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state @xcite with @xmath5 topological order.@xcite    returning to the ising model on the kagome lattice , the zero - field ground state is known to be highly degenerate.@xcite application of a small longitudinal magnetic field polarizes one third of the spins , but remarkably a macroscopic ground - state degeneracy survives .",
    "only further inclusion of quantum fluctuations lifts this degeneracy and gives rise to a state with quantum order of valence - bond crystal ( vbc ) type.@xcite this vbc state is accompanied by a pronounced plateau in the magnetization curve at one third of the saturation magnetization .",
    "a similar one - third plateau was also observed in the spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice.@xcite it was further argued that the states of the one - third plateau at the heisenberg point and close to the ising limit belong to the same phase.@xcite exchange anisotropy has also been shown to stabilize a 1/3 plateau in the classical limit @xmath6.@xcite more recently , however , the very existence of this one - third plateau in the spin-1/2 heisenberg model was challenged.@xcite in this context , it is noteworthy that a plateau close but not exactly equal to magnetization @xmath1 has been observed experimentally in two kagome compounds.@xcite    , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 plateaux in the @xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice .",
    "[ fig01 ] ]    at very high magnetic fields , one can rigorously construct a macroscopic number of quantum ground states for a class of highly frustrated lattices including the kagome lattice.@xcite these exact ground states arise just below the saturation field and are accompanied by a jump in the magnetization curve of height @xmath7 and a plateau just below this jump . for @xmath0 , the magnetization value on this plateaux",
    "is @xmath8 .",
    "since the ground states are known exactly , one can rigorously show that this high - field plateau exhibits the order sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] : in a background of polarized ( `` up '' ) spins one flipped ( `` down '' ) spin is localized in a quantum superposition on each hexagon marked by a dashed circle in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "note that the same global structure has been argued to hold at @xmath1,@xcite just the resonances in the hexagons are between three up and three down spins for @xmath1 .",
    "the states on both plateaux are indeed consistent with a two - dimensional generalization@xcite of a commensurability criterion.@xcite this criterion would allow further for an @xmath9 plateau and , indeed , the same structure as in sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] suggests itself at @xmath9 if one now considers two down and four up spins on each hexagon .",
    "the possibility of an @xmath9 plateau was mentioned previously,@xcite but has not been investigated systematically yet .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to provide a further analysis of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 plateaux .",
    "to be concrete , we focus on the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 heisenberg model on the kagome lattice @xmath10 @xmath11 is taken as the unit of energy and @xmath12 is the magnetic field along the @xmath13 direction .",
    "we will denote the magnetization per site by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the @xmath13-component of the total spin and @xmath16 the number of sites .",
    "this normalization ensures a saturation value @xmath17 .",
    "before we proceed , we mention that similar physics arises in bosonic models on the kagome lattice,@xcite opening a further route for experimental realizations via ultracold atoms in optical lattices.@xcite    the remainder of the manuscript is organized as follows : in sec .  [",
    "sec : argument ] , we generalize the exact wave function of the @xmath8 plateau to variational vbc wave functions for the candidate plateaux at @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in sec .  [",
    "sec : numerics ] , we perform extensive exact diagonalization ( ed ) on various lattices to confirm ( i ) the existence of these three plateaux and ( ii ) their vbc nature .",
    "in this section we will write down variational wave functions for the spin-1/2 model ( [ eq : model ] ) on the kagome lattice at @xmath1 and @xmath2 , following the example of the exactly known eigenstates with @xmath18.@xcite the crucial ingredients of the exact construction are `` independent '' localized magnon states where the magnons are strictly localized on the hexagons .",
    "the independent localized - magnon state for @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath8 is the so - called magnon - crystal state : @xmath20 see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] . here",
    "the first product runs over an ordered pattern of all non - overlapping hexagons denoted by the dashed circles in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] and the second product runs over the remaining sites .",
    "the localized - magnon state on a hexagon ( which is the lowest - energy state of a hexagon with one spin flipped ) is @xmath21 for convenience , we have introduced here the momentum eigenstate for a hexagon @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 has to be read modulo 6 , and @xmath25 is a normalization factor ensuring @xmath26 ( @xmath27 unless the state repeats under less than 6 translations ) .",
    "one can show that the state ( [ 2.01 ] ) , ( [ 2.02 ] ) is not only an exact three - fold degenerate eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath28 ( [ eq : model ] ) , but also a ground state in the subspace with @xmath29.@xcite its energy per site at @xmath30 is @xmath31 . from general arguments @xcite the magnon - crystal state ( [ 2.01 ] ) , ( [ 2.02 ] ) should have gapped excitations that lead to a plateau at @xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand , it has been argued@xcite that the 1/3 plateau is described by a similar wave function .",
    "the global pattern of resonances is again as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] , but now the dashed circles represent a combination of the two nel states on a hexagon .",
    "this provides a quantitative description for the @xmath1 state of the @xmath0 xxz heisenberg model in the limit of large values of the ising anisotropy @xmath32.@xcite although overlaps of the wave functions indicate that this remains qualitatively correct for the isotropic case @xmath33 , @xcite it may still be better to consider the lowest - energy singlet state of the heisenberg model on the hexagon @xmath34 .",
    "hence the corresponding three - fold degenerate valence - bond - crystal model state in the subspace with @xmath35 reads @xmath36 the six - spin heisenberg ring is easily diagonalized and one finds @xmath37 although the state ( [ 2.03 ] ) , ( [ 2.04 ] ) is not an exact eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath28 ( [ eq : model ] ) , it is a good model for the true ground state in the subspace with @xmath35 , see below .",
    "the variational energy of this state at @xmath30 is @xmath38 per site .",
    "this is considerably lower than the _ variational _ estimate @xmath39 derived from the superposition of the two nel states.@xcite consequently , the state ( [ 2.03 ] ) , ( [ 2.04 ] ) is closer to the true ground state for @xmath33 .",
    "inspired by the valence - bond - crystal states ( [ 2.01 ] ) , ( [ 2.02 ] ) and ( [ 2.03 ] ) , ( [ 2.04 ] ) for the plateaux at @xmath8 and @xmath40 , respectively , it is natural to propose a new variational wave function at @xmath9 : @xmath41 with @xmath42 the variational energy of this state at @xmath30 is @xmath43 per site .",
    "again , this is not an exact eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath28 ( [ eq : model ] ) , however , it is not far from the true ground state as extensive numerics show , see below .    it should be noted that in all three cases , the wave functions are three - fold degenerate .",
    "they can provide a number of consequences for correlations which in turn can be checked by exact diagonalization ( ed ) .",
    "in particular , in view of their crystalline nature , we expect a finite gap and thus a plateau in the magnetization curve not only for @xmath8 , but also for @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    in the following we present ed for finite systems and by comparison with theoretical predictions based on the variational wave functions ( [ 2.03 ] ) , ( [ 2.04 ] ) and ( [ 2.05 ] ) , ( [ 2.06 ] ) demonstrate that these model states provide a good description of the physics within the plateau regimes .",
    "we have performed extensive exact diagonalization ( ed ) using lanczos algorithm in order to compute the magnetization curve for various lattices .",
    "following ref .  , we consider a large variety of finite lattices using periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , including also less symmetric ones that can not accommodate the expected vbc , in order to analyze finite - size effects .",
    "also since the existence of short loops going around the lattices are the major finite - size effects , we perform the finite - size scaling using the geometric length , i.e. , the smallest distance around the torus .",
    "definitions of lattices and geometric distance are given in the appendix .",
    "since we are considering states with a large magnetization , we have to deal with smaller hilbert spaces than in @xmath44 , which means that we can access larger lattices . in this study",
    ", we have considered lattices up to @xmath45 for which we can compute some part of the magnetization curve .",
    "given the number of data , we do not plot all system sizes but fig .",
    "[ fig : mvsh ] shows part of the magnetization curves for lattices that accommodate the vbc discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : argument ] .",
    "we recover some known features , such as the exact saturation field @xmath46 that can be understood in terms of the localized magnon eigenstates and a jump to @xmath8 . for this plateau ,",
    "we have considered more lattices than previously in the literature , and we already see on the plot that its width seems to saturate as system size increases .",
    "a detailed analysis will be performed below .",
    "similarly , looking at the @xmath1 and @xmath2 finite - size plateaux , it seems that finite - size effects are rather weak both for the width and the location of these plateaux .",
    "focusing on the expected plateaux at @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , we plot their widths in fig .",
    "[ fig : width ] as a function of the inverse diameter which we believe is the relevant parameter .",
    "first of all , we do observe some variations of the data and peculiar results for the smallest lattices , but if we rely on the largest lattices ( in the sense of their diameter , see appendix ) , then we do observe a tendency to saturation to finite values for all three plateaux .",
    "moreover , since our scenario relies on the existence of vbc states that _ do not fit _ on all lattices ( for instance , the unit cell has 9 sites so clusters need to have @xmath47 sites ) , it is not expected a priori to have similar widths on different lattices , which could explain some scattering in the data .",
    "therefore , we consider only lattices having the k point in the brillouin zone ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : gaps ] for a plot of the brillouin zone ) .",
    ", @xmath2 and @xmath3 plateaux obtained from exact diagonalization on various lattices ( see appendix for a list ) , plotted as a function of the inverse diameter .",
    "filled symbols correspond to lattices that can accommodate the vbc states , i.e. , possess the k point in their brillouin zone : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 ) .",
    "open symbols are for the others .",
    "data are consistent with finite values for all three plateaux in the thermodynamic limit . ]    in order to perform finite - size scaling , it does not seem appropriate to us to use a simple linear fit extrapolation as done in ref .  .",
    "indeed , for a finite plateau , one expects an exponential saturation when the system size ( or diameter ) increases .",
    "hence , by performing such extrapolation of our data , we obtain _ finite _ plateaux for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , with decreasing widths of the order of @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively . for @xmath8 , this new estimate for the plateau width",
    "is actually slightly larger than a previous estimate@xcite @xmath57 .      in order to characterize possible",
    "symmetry breaking , it is useful to investigate the low - energy levels quantum numbers on a finite lattice .",
    "for instance , according to sec .",
    "[ sec : argument ] , we expect to have vbc states on these plateaux with three - fold degeneracy . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", this implies that we have degeneracy between states at the @xmath58 point @xmath59 and the two - fold degenerate k point ( k @xmath60 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gaps ] , we plot the energy gaps obtained by computing the ten lowest eigenstates in each symmetry sector using a davidson algorithm . we have subtracted the ground - state energy for each @xmath15 , but for comparison with the variational vbc states , let us mention that on @xmath61 lattice , the ground - state energy per site for @xmath1 is @xmath62 , for @xmath9 : @xmath63 , and for @xmath8 we get the exact vbc state with @xmath64 . therefore , our simple vbc wavefunctions ( without any adjustable parameter ) already give a reasonable estimate of these ground - state energies .    about the excited states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gaps ] , exact degenerate magnon eigenstates are found for @xmath65 as expected . for @xmath8 ( i.e. , @xmath66 )",
    ", the ground - state is more than three - fold degenerate due to small loops going around the lattice ( on @xmath67 , degeneracy is exactly three , see below ) , but there is evidence of a small gap above them . at @xmath9 ( @xmath68 )",
    ", we do observe two - fold degenerate states with momentum k close to the @xmath58 ground - state , and a sizable gap above them .",
    "for @xmath61 lattice labeled with their quantum numbers . for @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71",
    "corresponding respectively to @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the lowest excitation corresponds to a two - fold degenerate state at the k point in the brillouin zone , and then a sizable gap above it ( indicated by the encircled symbols and the arrows ) .",
    "these spectra are compatible with the vbc states for such magnetizations .",
    "the dashed encircled symbols denote levels which might indicate persistence of symmetry breaking also away from the nominal plateaux .",
    "the magnetization sectors with a gray background are not visited in the magnetization curve , i.e. , they are obscured by a magnetization jump . ]",
    "let us also mention a possible feature below the @xmath9 plateau : on the low - energy spectrum , we observe the same feature as on the plateau , which could signal the persistence of vbc order _",
    "away _ from this magnetization . however , since we expect that the magnetization decreases smoothly from the plateau , such a state could possibly exhibit both off - diagonal and diagonal long - range order , i.e. , a supersolid state.@xcite one has to be cautious about this scenario , since other possibilities exist such as the absence of superfluid signal , or magnetization jump .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that this would be an interesting topic to investigate further . for instance",
    ", simple bosonic models on the same lattice only exhibit plateaux at @xmath72 , and there is no supersolid phase.@xcite            having established the existence of these three plateaux , we now turn to their characterization .",
    "let us remind that according to hastings theorem,@xcite @xmath9 and @xmath8 plateaux necessarily correspond to a ( at least three - fold ) degenerate ground - state . while exotic scenarios with topological degeneracy are possible , the more usual case is to have a system that breaks lattice symmetries .",
    "this is not necessarily the case for @xmath1 , but our arguments ( see sec .  [ sec : argument ] ) indicate that all three plateaux correspond to similar three - fold degenerate vbc states .    for each magnetization @xmath73 , we have computed connected spin correlation functions @xmath74 as well as connected dimer - dimer correlations @xmath75 using ed on the @xmath61 lattice for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and the @xmath67 lattice for @xmath8 .",
    "these are the largest lattices ( in the sense of their diameter , see appendix ) available for each @xmath73 value .",
    "data are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrpanel ] .    in order to make a more precise connection with our vbc picture ,",
    "we have also computed the same quantities on the pure states as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] . for each @xmath73",
    ", we have three degenerate states that are orthogonal in the thermodynamic limit , so that we can choose to symmetrize them ( for instance in the fully symmetric irreducible representation ) in order to construct a uniform state .",
    "equivalently , one can choose one vbc state and then average over distances . to perform these computations",
    "is a bit tedious but straightforward . we give here some details on the calculation , and relevant results",
    "are shown in tables  [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] .",
    "for spin correlations , if sites @xmath76 and @xmath77 belong to the same hexagon , then correlations can be obtained from the hexagon wavefunctions given in eqs .",
    "( [ 2.02 ] ) , ( [ 2.04 ] ) , and ( [ 2.06 ] ) ; if site @xmath76 corresponds to a polarized site ( resp .",
    "resonating hexagon ) , then @xmath78 ( resp .",
    "@xmath79 ) .",
    "if sites @xmath76 and @xmath77 are sufficiently distant , then correlation simply factorizes since we have a product state . as an example for @xmath8 , the nearest - neighbor spin correlations is given by @xmath80 while at large distance we find only two different values @xmath81 and @xmath82 and similar computations can be performed for other @xmath73 and distances .",
    "dimer correlation can be computed in a similar way , but since we have many possibilities for @xmath83 and @xmath84 bonds , we will not give all numbers .",
    "we need to compute @xmath85 : when @xmath76 and @xmath77 are nearest neighbors inside one resonating hexagon , then this is simply the energy per bond for the wavefunctions ( [ 2.02 ] ) , ( [ 2.04 ] ) , and ( [ 2.06 ] ) ; in the other case , one site is necessarily a polarized one so that correlations reduce to @xmath86 .",
    "let us denote these two values as @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "if we neglect short - distance effects that require detailed computation ( ten different relative bond positions ) , then computations are much simpler and we have found only two cases @xmath89 and @xmath90 as an example for @xmath8 , we obtain respectively @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
