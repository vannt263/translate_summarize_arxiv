    "there are strong evidence for cosmological matter - antimatter asymmetry , or baryon asymmetry .",
    "recent results from wmap 3rd year data suggests  @xcite @xmath0 this value agrees well with the prediction of big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) inferred from observations of the light element abundances  @xcite .",
    "although various mechanisms are proposed in order to explain this value , it is yet unknown which is the right scenario .",
    "this is partly because more or less any baryogenesis mechanism is based on physics beyond the standard model and partly because thermal history of the universe before bbn is difficult to probe .    among many candidates , perhaps the best motivated model as physics beyond the standard model is supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite .",
    "not only it naturally solves the hierarchy problem , but also provides the dark matter candidate .",
    "furthermore , susy may play an important role in generating baryon asymmetry of the universe . in affleck - dine mechanism",
    "@xcite the dynamics of flat directions existing in the scalar potential of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) can efficiently produce baryon asymmetry .",
    "on the other hand , the supersymmetry and supergravity theories predicts new particles such as gravitinos and moduli which interact with other particles only through gravity and hence have long lifetimes .",
    "it is revealed that those particles may cause disaster for conventional cosmological scenario . among such long - lived particles ,",
    "the cosmological problem of the gravitino has been most intensively studied by many authors . in gravity - mediation scenarios ,",
    "gravitinos are expected to have masses of order 100 to 1000 gev or so , and they decay during or after bbn . injected radiation and hadrons associated with the decay process significantly affect the light element abundances and spoil the success of bbn . in order to avoid this disaster ,",
    "the abundance of the garvitinos should be small enough . since the gravitino abundance is proportional to the reheating temperature after inflation , the stringent constraint on the reheating temperature",
    "is imposed  @xcite . in gauge - mediation scenarios , since mass of gravitino is estimated to be of order kev , the gravitino becomes lsp ( lightest supersymmetric particle ) . in this case",
    "the condition that produced lsp should not overclose the universe also leads to constraint on the reheating temperature  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the recent articles , it was pointed out that the inflaton decays into gravitinos through supergravity effect , which results in overproduction of gravitinos even for low reheating temperature  @xcite .",
    "more problematic situation arises when modulus fields exist .",
    "potential of moduli is flat when susy is exact but susy breaking effects lift the flatness of the potential with curvature of order @xmath1 .",
    "in addition to this low energy supersymmetry breaking , vacuum energy from inflaton also breaks susy , which gives rise to modulus mass of the order of the hubble parameter @xmath2  @xcite . for @xmath3",
    "the modulus field sits down at the potential minimum determined by hubble induced mass term .",
    "this minimum does not necessarily coincide with the true minimum of the potential , and naively it is expected that they are separated by amount of @xmath4(@xmath4 : planck mass ) . when @xmath5 , the modulus field starts to oscillate around the true minimum with typical amplitude of @xmath4 .",
    "since the coherent oscillation of modulus fields behave as non - relativistic matter , it soon dominates the energy density of the universe .",
    "as the decay rate of moduli is of the same order as that of gravitinos , the same cosmological difficulty arises  @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the case of gravitinos lowering reheating temperature has nothing to do with moduli oscillation , so solving cosmological moduli problem is much more difficult .",
    "so far several mechanisms to avoid the cosmological moduli problem have been proposed  . among them",
    "the most appealing solution relies on late - time entropy production to dilute the moduli .",
    "here we concentrate on thermal inflation model  @xcite as a solution to the moduli problem . in the thermal inflation scenario a scalar field called `` flaton ''",
    "causes a mini - inflation after the primordial inflation and the subsequent decay of the flaton produce huge entropy enough to avoid the cosmological moduli problem ( for detailed discussion , see  @xcite ) .",
    "it is noticed that the gravitinos are also significantly diluted by the thermal inflation and the gravitino problem is solved simultaneously .",
    "however , the same mechanism also dilutes the pre - existing baryon asymmetry .",
    "even affleck - dine mechanism can not generate the enough baryon number which survives from thermal inflation  @xcite .",
    "thus , the baryon number should be regenerated after thermal inflation . since thermal inflation ends at about @xmath6  tev , baryogenesis mechanism which works at sufficiently low energy",
    "is required .",
    "one possible candidate is electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite , but for the typical reheating temperature after flaton decay is lower than 100gev , this mechanism may not work .",
    "another possibility is modified version of affleck - dine baryogenesis with @xmath7 flat direction which takes place after thermal inflation  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the modified affleck - dine baryogenesis works by solving simplified dynamics of the scalar fields . however ,",
    "actual dynamics of the scalar fields in this model is much complicated and it is not clear whether the proper amount of baryon number is created or not when one solves full dynamics including all the relevant scalar fields . in this paper , therefore , we study the full dynamics of the scalar fields using lattice simulation .",
    "we adopt the model proposed in  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[model ] we describe our model and overview of the dynamics , in particular how the baryon asymmetry is generated in this model naturally . in sec.[num ] we show the results of lattice simulation and constraints on the neutrino mass and @xmath8-term to obtain enough baryon number . in sec.[conclusion ]",
    "we give our conclusions .",
    "we start with the mssm superpotential , @xmath9 where @xmath10 s are yukawa couplings , @xmath11 is the index of generation and @xmath12 or @xmath13 index is omitted .",
    "the last term of ( [ mssmw ] ) is called @xmath8-term where @xmath8 is the only dimensionful parameter in the mssm .",
    "hereafter , we also omit the generation indices for simplicity .",
    "furthermore , we add the following non - renormalizable superpotential which is responsible for neutrino mass : @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes some cut - off scale . this term is regarded as majorana mass term for left handed neutrino when @xmath16 has the vev , and also be regarded as the term which lifts the potential of @xmath7 flat direction  @xcite .",
    "we also introduce a singlet field @xmath17 which couples with @xmath18 as @xmath19 then this term explains the natural value of @xmath8 with the expectation value of @xmath17  @xcite , @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the vev of @xmath17 .",
    "since the required value of @xmath22 is around electroweak scale , this relation determines @xmath21 . in our scenario",
    "the most attractive choice is @xmath23 , because if we assume @xmath24 and @xmath25 eq.([mu_phi0 ] ) would give @xmath26gev , which is required for flaton field  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this model , the singlet field @xmath17 , which is introduced to solve the naturalness of @xmath8-term , can be naturally regarded as flaton which leads to thermal inflation . in order to stabilize the flaton potential ,",
    "we add the self coupling of the flaton field given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 .    to summarize ,",
    "our superpotential is written as @xmath29 we can forbid the other possible terms in the above superpotential using @xmath30-parity and some discrete symmetry , such as @xmath31 symmetry , under which each field transforms non - trivially  @xcite . furthermore , by gauging @xmath31 symmetry we can avoid the domain wall problem associated with discrete minima of the potential . here",
    "we only assume this problem can be avoided by some mechanism which does not affect the dynamics we are interested in .",
    "note that since the origin of neutrino mass term and flaton sector depend on different physics at high energy , cut - off scale @xmath32 and @xmath15 which appear in eq.([fullw ] ) do not need to coincide with each other . in order to obtain a phenomenologically viable neutrino mass @xmath33ev , the @xmath34 satisfies @xmath35 which suggests that @xmath36 for the @xmath37 coupling .",
    "however , in this paper , we set @xmath38 and take @xmath39 as a free parameter .",
    "then the natural parameter range for @xmath39 is expected to be rather large compared with @xmath40 or @xmath41 .      during thermal inflation all fields",
    "are trapped to the origin due to thermal effects , and when thermal inflation ends at temperature @xmath42  gev , the flaton field @xmath17 and @xmath7 flat direction begin to roll down to the instant minimum of their potential .",
    "the full scalar potential in our model consists of the @xmath43-term associated with ( [ fullw ] ) , @xmath44-term and soft susy breaking terms",
    ". we can parameterize the flat directions @xmath45 and @xmath18 as @xmath46 the @xmath43-term potential is given by @xmath47 , where @xmath48 runs all scalar fields included in the superpotential , explicitly , @xmath49 the @xmath44-term contribution is written as @xmath50 finally , the soft susy breaking terms including soft masses and a - terms are @xmath51 note that we assume that @xmath52 and @xmath53 so that the flaton @xmath17 and the flat direction @xmath7 rolls away from the origin of the potential and create baryon number after thermal inflation .",
    "justification of these ansatz is rather non - trivial  @xcite , but it is possible to obtain valid parameter space  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "as explained below , the most stringent constraint comes from the requirement that the true vacuum must break the electroweak symmetry spontaneously .",
    "this implies that mass matrix of the higgs fields at the origin must have the negative determinant , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 from eqs .",
    "( [ v_f ] ) and ( [ v_sb ] ) .",
    "note that hubble parameter @xmath2 is sufficiently smaller than the typical scale appearing in the dynamics and negligible in the interested regime .    here",
    "we briefly describe outline of the dynamics of this model .",
    "as mentioned above , at the end of thermal inflation , the flaton @xmath17 and @xmath7 flat direction begin to roll away from the origin .",
    "if the @xmath7 direction first rolls away , the minimum of @xmath7 is determined by the term @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ v_sb ] ) .",
    "as @xmath17 rolls down the potential and increases its field value , @xmath7 begins to feel the positive mass from the term @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ v_f ] ) and at the same time , the term @xmath59 gives @xmath7 direction the angular kick .",
    "the minimum of the angular direction determined by this term is different from the initial one , which is source of cp violation .",
    "if the following condition @xmath60 is satisfied , the potential for the @xmath7 direction is stabilized at the origin and finally sit down there .",
    "however , it is not clear whether @xmath61 conserving terms dominate the potential at this epoch .",
    "if not , @xmath7 direction receives angular kick repeatedly and we lose the ability for predicting the resultant baryon number . since the whole dynamics at this stage is quite complicated , we perform a numerical calculation based on lattice simulation .      before going into the detailed analysis of the numerical calculation , we comment on the reheating and entropy production in our model .",
    "the final reheating temperature is determined by the flaton decay rate @xmath62 as @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the effective degree of freedom at @xmath65 .",
    "let us denote the epoch at which baryon asymmetry is generated as @xmath66 ( which is almost the same time as the end of thermal inflation ) and at which @xmath17 decays as @xmath67 .",
    "the final baryon to entropy ratio is given by @xmath68 of course , it is lepton number that this process generates but the electroweak sphaleron effect quickly converts the @xmath69 into @xmath55 number  @xcite .",
    "next we estimate the flaton decay rate . in the present model",
    ", @xmath17 can decay into two higgs bosons or higgsinos if kinematically allowed .",
    "the decay rate is estimated as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a constant of order @xmath72 .",
    "if we assume @xmath24 , this gives @xmath73gev .",
    "but note that even if the above decay modes are kinematically forbidden , the flaton can decay into two photons or gluons through the one loop diagrams associated with the particles in the thermal bath required for thermal inflation  @xcite .",
    "these processes also give decay rate that is roughly the same order as eq .",
    "( [ decayrate ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the natural range of the final reheating temperature is much lower than the electroweak scale .",
    "we have investigated the full dynamics with potential  ( [ v_f ] ) , ( [ v_d ] ) and ( [ v_sb ] ) using lattice simulation . in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , an ad hoc large damping term was put by hand under assumption that the flaton field quickly decays through parametric resonance . in this work ,",
    "we have not made any such artificial assumption .",
    "the only non - trivial input for computing the dynamics is initial condition . as the initial condition",
    ", we set the initial values of all fields at around 1tev as homogeneous part , as is expected for thermal fluctuations at the end of thermal inflation . our simulation is performed with one - dimensional lattice with 128 grid points .",
    "initial fluctuations come from quantum fluctuation around the homogeneous mode .",
    "we apply the method used in latticeeasy @xcite for including these quantum fluctuation . in order to eliminate unphysical effect due to large quantum fluctuations at short distance",
    ", we have cut the initial quantum fluctuations with mode @xmath74 , although this does not much affect the result ( for more detail about initial condition for tachyonic potential , see  @xcite ) .",
    "it is found that the dynamics is rather sensitive to the model parameters .",
    "however , since there are many parameters in the model and full parameter search is beyond the scope of this paper , we have performed the simulations fixing the most of parameters as @xmath75  gev , @xmath76  gev , @xmath77  gev , @xmath78  gev , @xmath79 , @xmath80  gev , @xmath81  gev , @xmath82  gev , and arg@xmath83 .",
    "we also take @xmath84 .",
    "all @xmath85-terms are taken to be real by field redefinition and hence the only remaining parameter associated with @xmath86 angle is arg@xmath87 .",
    "the other parameters are varied in each of the following analysis .    first , we show the typical motion of the field @xmath88 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rel_iml ] when only the homogeneous mode is taken into account .",
    "we can see that first @xmath88 rolls down to the displaced minimum and then pull back to the origin , as explained in the previous section . in this process , @xmath88 is kicked to angular direction , and finally the field rotates around the origin with constant angular momentum ( i.e. , conserved lepton number ) , in the complex plane .     in the complex plane .",
    "here we write only zero mode .",
    "the field value is normalized by @xmath89gev .",
    "we take @xmath90 , arg@xmath91 . ]    from fig .",
    "[ fig : rel_iml ] it is obvious that lepton number is really generated",
    ". however , the present universe ( or at bbn or recombination epoch ) contains large number of causally disconnected regions at the era of thermal inflation .",
    "this means that the real baryon number is average over many regions with different initial values of @xmath88 field .",
    "the initial values of @xmath88 is determined by the thermal fluctuations at the end of thermal inflation .",
    "thus , the initial values of phase of @xmath88 is random and @xmath92 also fluctuates around @xmath93 .",
    "taking fluctuations of @xmath88 into account , we perform the simulations varying the initial phase of @xmath88 with initial @xmath94 fixed . as for the initial value of @xmath17",
    ", we fix its phase , but we have confirmed that initial angular dependence of the @xmath17 field does not much affect the subsequent dynamics .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : argl_nl ] the relation between the initial angle arg(@xmath88 ) and the resultant baryon asymmetry . from this figure",
    "it is seen that the average baryon number is really non - zero .",
    "[ fig : t_nl ] shows the time evolution of the baryon number . from this figure",
    "we can clearly see the baryon number is finally conserved .",

    "]     is normalized by ( 100gev)@xmath96 .",
    "parameters are same as fig.[fig : argl_nl ] , and each line corresponds to different initial angle .",
    "data points are reduced in order to make it easy to see . ]    as explained in previous section , whether or not the net baryon asymmetry is generated depends on cp phase .",
    "the phase of the flaton field takes the value that minimizes the potential of the angular direction determined by the term @xmath97 in the interested time scale .",
    "the relevant potential of angular direction for @xmath7 comes from the term @xmath98 initially , and subsequent dynamics depends on the terms @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "initially , the angular minimum lies in the direction arg@xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the angular minimum is unchanged when arg@xmath103 and @xmath104 so the net baryon number expected to become zero .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cp_nl ] .     and net baryon number . when @xmath86 is conserved , the net lepton number becomes zero as explained in the text . ]    finally , we fix arg@xmath91 and choose freely the absolute value of @xmath40 and @xmath39 .",
    "each of these parameters is directly related to @xmath105 [ eq .  (",
    "[ numass])]and @xmath8 [ eq .  ( [ mu_phi0 ] ) ] .",
    "in fig.[fig : mnu_mu_nl ] we plot generated baryon number @xmath106 in terms of @xmath105 and @xmath8 . since our choice of arg@xmath91 corresponds to nearly maximum cp phase , the baryon - to - entropy ratio in fig.[fig : mnu_mu_nl ]",
    "is reduced for different choice of arg@xmath87 .",
    "thus , the apparent large @xmath107 is not a problem . for smaller @xmath105 ( or @xmath39 ) than @xmath108  ev , @xmath65 must exceed about 10gev even for maximum cp phase , which is invalid for the present model . for smaller value of @xmath8 ( or @xmath40 ) than about @xmath109  gev , although the constraint  ( [ positivemass ] ) can be satisfied , we could not get appropriate dynamics due to smallness of positive mass squared of @xmath7 direction . on the other hand ,",
    "the constraint  ( [ constraint ] ) invalidates @xmath8 larger than about 840gev . as a result , only constrained parameter region around @xmath110gev and @xmath108ev@xmath111ev can survive .",
    "however , we have to mention that our model has quite large number of parameters and the dynamics is sensitive to them .",
    "thus the stringent constraints should not be taken too seriously .",
    "complete analysis of parameter dependence is beyond the scope of the present paper , but it should be noticed that our results indicate that it is really possible to generate baryon asymmetry even after thermal inflation .    ,",
    "@xmath105(ev ) and @xmath8(gev ) .",
    "region below the horizontal line requires @xmath112gev to obtain desired value of @xmath107 . ]",
    "in this paper detailed analysis of the affleck - dine mechanism after thermal inflation has been performed .",
    "the present model includes only one additional gauge singlet which does not exist in the mssm .",
    "this singlet field explains naturally both the origin of @xmath8-term and thermal inflation .",
    "this is an appealing feature when considering the cosmological moduli problem seriously .",
    "however , it is not trivial matter to generate enough baryon asymmetry consistent with late - time entropy production . in this paper",
    "we have demonstrated that a proper amount of baryon asymmetry can be generated using the lattice calculation for the whole dynamics without any artificial assumption .",
    "although the parameter tuning is necessary for the present mechanism to work , it is noticed that since the dynamics is highly sensitive to parameters in the model there can be another parameter sets appropriate for our purpose which we could not find .",
    "we stress that if the late time entropy production takes place and dilute the preexisting baryon number density , the modified affleck - dine process considered in this paper is the only known mechanism to re - create the baryon number at very low energy scale after late - time entropy production .",
    "it is interesting that this mechanism can work with quite low reheating temperature even below the electroweak scale .",
    "this opens up a new possibility for such a low - energy baryogenesis , and may be tested in future accelerator experiments .",
