    "anais project aims at the study of the annual modulation signal attributed to galactic dark matter particles using 250 kg nai(tl ) scintillators at the canfranc underground laboratory ( lsc ) , in spain .",
    "nai(tl ) large crystals have been applied for a long time in the search for galactic dark matter particles through their elastic scattering off the target nuclei in the detector by measuring the weak scintillation signal produced @xcite .",
    "however , energies deposited in the form of nuclear recoils are small , which added to the low efficiency to convert that energy into scintillation , makes that events at or very near the energy threshold , attributed either to radioactive backgrounds or to spurious noise ( non - bulk nai(tl ) scintillation events ) , can compromise the sensitivity goals of such an experiment .",
    "dama experiment , at the laboratori nazionali del gran sasso , in italy , and using 100 kg nai(tl ) target , reported first evidence of the presence of an annual modulation in the detection rate compatible with that expected for a dark matter signal just in the region below 6  kevee ( electron equivalent energy ) with a high statistical significance @xcite .",
    "this signal was further confirmed by libra experiment , using 250 kg of more radiopure nai(tl ) detectors @xcite . using the same target than dama / libra experiment , which accumulates by now fourteen annual cycles , makes possible for anais to confirm dama / libra results in a model - independent way .",
    "to achieve such a goal anais detectors should be as good ( or better ) as ( than ) those of dama / libra in terms of energy threshold and radioactive background below 10 kevee ( electron equivalent energy ) . in this paper",
    "we will present some of the past and recent efforts to determine and reduce the background related to @xmath0 contamination in several prototypes , as well as to determine the achievable threshold profiting from the low energy events population , conveniently tagged , that such a contamination provides .",
    "we will start by presenting the anais project and the different crystals and experimental set - ups studied ; then , we will move to understand the importance of the background due to @xmath0 contamination and the technique used to determine its content in the different crystals , in particular , in anais-25 modules , as well as the results derived .",
    "anais project was conceived to use 10 hexagonal nai(tl ) crystals of 10.7 kg each made by bicron ( now saint gobain ) in the eighties .",
    "these detectors were part of those used in an experiment which looked for the @xmath2 @xmath3 decay to the first excited state at the modane underground laboratory first  @xcite , and then at the lsc  @xcite .",
    "they have been stored underground since the late eighties .",
    "after that , the nai32 experiment searched for dark matter at the lsc with 3 of these detectors ( amounting 32.1 kg ) and accumulating two years of data taking .",
    "bounds on wimp masses and cross - sections were derived from the absence of positive hints , both in the usual analysis of the total rate , and in a pioneer modulation analysis  @xcite .",
    "then , one of the nai crystals was chosen to be further studied and modified : it was used to build anais prototype  i  @xcite , and after decoupling the pmt and removing the original stainless - steel encapsulation it was used in anais prototypes  ii  @xcite and  iii ( see fig.[fig : crystals ] , left ) . in prototype",
    "ii a copper box was used to allow testing easily different light guides geometries and lengths , optical couplings and reflector / diffuser materials , whereas in prototype  iii ( piii ) a tight copper encapsulation was designed and pmts and optionally light guides were coupled in a second step .",
    "the @xmath0 content of these crystals ( see section [ sec : resultsk ] ) was too high to allow their use in a dark matter search experiment , which implied a significant change in the anais experiment time - line .",
    "the anais collaboration started to look for new nai(tl ) crystals with very low content in potassium ( less than 20ppb ) .",
    "saint gobain @xcite was contacted as the first option to produce the new crystals , as it had low radioactive background state - of - the - art nai(tl ) detector technology : they had previously built dama / libra detectors with similar background requirements .",
    "a 9.7 kg nai(tl ) crystal had been bought previously to that company to be tested as first step in this direction .",
    "this crystal ( see fig.[fig : crystals ] , center ) was used to build the anais-0 module .",
    "the crystal was encapsulated at the university of zaragoza in etp ( electrolytic tough pitch ) copper , closing tightly the detector , and using two synthetic quartz windows to get the light out to the photomultiplier tubes . a teflon sheet as diffuser and a vikuitireflector layer wrapped the crystal to increase light collection efficiency .",
    "anais-0 module was designed to characterize and understand anais background at low energy , optimize nai scintillation events selection , fix the calibration method and test the electronics .",
    "anais-0 module took data in different configurations : with or without 10 cm light guides and using different pmt models @xcite .",
    "a detailed background study of anais-0 module in the different configurations tested has been recently published  @xcite .",
    "levels of @xmath0 of that crystal were not enough for anais requirements , as will be shown in section [ sec : resultsk_a ] . unfortunately , the contacts with saint gobain to develop more radiopure crystals were not successful .",
    "the anais experiment had then to be redefined and , in order to reach the experimental goals , the final proposal consisted of 250 kg of ultrapure nai(tl ) crystals to study the expected annual modulation in the galactic dark matter signal .",
    "an ultrapure powder provider and manufacturer of the ultra - low - background crystals had to be searched for .",
    "a nai powder having a potassium level under the limit of the analytical techniques used for the radioactivity screening ( less than 90ppb ) was found , and then , two crystals were grown by alpha spectra @xcite to determine , afterwards , more precisely the potassium content using the coincidence technique presented in section[sec:40k ] .",
    "these two nai(tl ) crystals ( 12.5 kg each ) form the anais-25 setup , and are named detector 0 ( d0 ) and 1 ( d1 ) , respectively ( see fig.[fig : crystals ] , right ) .",
    "the crystals were encapsulated in ofhc copper with two synthetic quartz windows allowing the pmts coupling in a second step , to be done at lsc clean room . only white teflon was used as light diffuser , wrapping the crystal , inside the copper encapsulation .",
    "after the determination of the corresponding potassium level ( presented in section[sec : resultsk_b ] ) , these detectors are still taking data at the lsc , remaining as main goal an overall background assessment@xcite .",
    "@xmath0 is probably the most relevant radioactive contaminant in the bulk for nai(tl ) detectors .",
    "it is specially important its contribution to the background at very low energy , as it will be shown below . because of that ,",
    "a very good knowledge of such a contamination is required in order to properly estimate the sensitivity prospects achievable in the frame of the anais project .    the technique used to estimate the @xmath0 activity in the bulk of the nai(tl ) crystal is the measurement in coincidence : one detector measures the energy released by the x - ray / auger electrons emissions of argon , amounting a total energy release of 3.2kev , following the k - shell ec of @xmath0 , while another detector measures the high energy gamma at 1460.8kev , escaping from the former , and being fully absorbed in the latter .",
    "besides a few accidental coincidences , the 3.2kev peak can be clearly observed in all the studied crystals . from the measured coincidence rates and the corresponding efficiencies estimated with geant4 package , the @xmath0 activity in the crystal can be deduced . in figure",
    "[ fig : decayk ] a simplified @xmath0 decay diagram is shown and more details on the @xmath0 decay channels can be found in table [ tab : decayk ] .    k decay diagram .",
    "data have been taken from @xcite .",
    "more details about branching ratios and decay channels are given in table [ tab : decayk].,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    concerning the contribution to the background at low energy from the decay of this isotope , it is precisely the x - ray / auger electrons emission of argon after k - shell ec in @xmath0 , amounting a total energy release of 3.2kev , which is more dangerous .",
    "a part of these events is moved to higher energies by the simultaneous interaction of the high energy gamma in the same detector , another part is vetoed by an interaction of the high energy gamma in another detector , however , a residual peak at 3.2kev jeopardizes the search for dark matter if @xmath0 content is not at a few ppb level . at this point , it is worth noticing that the rate of the direct decay of @xmath0 to the ground state of @xmath4 through ec ( at the 0.2% level ) has not been yet experimentally measured , and hence , the uncertainty on the corresponding branching ratio is really high @xcite .",
    "this decay is important for the final anais background because those events can not be rejected by the coincidence method . at this moment , and up to our knowledge , there is not a feasible way to determine more precisely such a branching ratio .",
    "different dedicated setups were operated at the lsc with the objective of determining the @xmath0 content of all the nai(tl ) available crystals .",
    "pictures of those crystals have been shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : crystals ] and their main features are summarized in table  [ tab : crystals ] .",
    "we describe below briefly the most relevant aspects of the different experimental set - ups , corresponding pictures are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setups ] , in which the coincidence measurements were carried out .",
    "all the set - ups have been operated at the lsc facilities ( under 2450m.w.e . ) , inside a shielding consisting of 10 cm archaeological lead plus 20 cm low activity lead , all enclosed in a pvc box tightly closed and continuously flushed with boil - off nitrogen .    1 .   * bicron set - up . * in this set - up the bicron detectors were measured without modification with respect to their original assembly .",
    "because of that , only one pmt per crystal was recording the scintillation signal . in order to mostly profit from the large number of crystals available",
    ", six and seven crystal units were measured simultaneously in two runs ( labeled as _ a _ and _ b _ in table  [ tab : setups ] ) .",
    "although using only one pmt signal was quite limiting to lower the experimental threshold , the tagging with the high energy gamma from potassium allowed to distinguish clearly the 3.2kev peak in all the crystals and to derive the results shown in section[sec : resultsk ] . a picture of the setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setups ] , left .",
    "* anais-0 and prototype iii set - up . * the estimate of the @xmath0 bulk content of the anais-0 crystal , was done by measuring in coincidence with the previously studied prototype iii in a dedicated setup , shown in fig .",

    "measurements were carried out in several phases , see table  [ tab : setups ] , and although phase iii had another purpose  @xcite , the corresponding data will be revised too in section [ sec : resultsk_a ] .",

    "* anais-25 set - up*. the main goal of the anais-25 set - up was precisely the determination of the potassium content of the new crystals .",

    "the building of the spectra was done by software ( off - line ) by adding the signals from both pmts whenever possible .",

    "in this section , we will present the potassium bulk content results for all the studied crystals .",
    "the first step in order to derive the @xmath0 activity in one crystal , is to select the corresponding energy windows containing the 1460.8kev energy depositions in the other(s ) crystal(s ) sharing the experimental space .",
    "the @xmath0 activity of every crystal can be estimated with the area of the 3.2kev peak _ ( area ) _ identified in the coincident spectra with the high energy window chosen in the other(s ) detector(s ) , the total available live time _ ( t ) _ , the crystal mass _ ( m ) _ , the efficiency of the coincidence , determined by simulation using geant4 package _ ( @xmath7 ) _ and the fraction of events effectively selected by the coincidence window chosen _ ( f ) _ :    @xmath8    only statistical errors coming from the 3.2kev peak area determination are taken into account in the derivation of the activity errors shown in the following .    first of all , eleven nai(tl ) crystals from bicron , 10.7 kg mass each were measured : six and seven detectors were placed in a similar configuration in runs _ a _ and _ b _ , respectively , using two of them in both as cross - check . the results for the @xmath0 activity corresponding to all of the old bicron crystals are presented in table  [ tab : potassiumbicron ] .",

    "phase ii presented a non gaussian shape for the 1460.8kev gamma line of piii which might have been caused by gain instabilities .",
    "however , phase i showed a higher discrepancy between the results determined with the different sigma windows and in fig .",

    "moreover , any other external @xmath0 contamination would also contribute to the 1460.8kev line .",
    "we chose data from anais-0 operating without piii to minimize contributions from external components contaminated in @xmath0 to the photopeak and fitted it to a gaussian , comparing its area with the prediction of our geant4 simulation ( see fig.[fig : a02_40k ] ) .",
    "for 500000 isotropic 1460.8kev photons simulated , the anais-0 crystal detects 135294 photons in the photopeak ( 27.1% ) . taking into account that only in 10.55% of the @xmath0 decays a high energy gamma is emitted , if the result for this 1461 - 1464kev peak is @xmath24cpd / kg , the activity of @xmath0 derived is @xmath25mbq / kg assuming that only @xmath0 in the crystal bulk is contributing .",

    "<S> nai(tl ) large crystals are applied in the search for galactic dark matter particles through their elastic scattering off the target nuclei in the detector by measuring the scintillation signal produced . </S>",
    "<S> however , energies deposited in the form of nuclear recoils are small , which added to the low efficiency to convert that energy into scintillation , makes that events at or very near the energy threshold , attributed either to radioactive backgrounds or to spurious noise ( non - bulk nai(tl ) scintillation events ) , can compromise the sensitivity goals of such an experiment . </S>",
    "<S> dama / libra experiment , using 250 kg nai(tl ) target , reported first evidence of the presence of an annual modulation in the detection rate compatible with that expected for a dark matter signal just in the region below 6kevee ( electron equivalent energy ) . in the frame of the anais ( annual modulation with nai scintillators ) </S>",
    "<S> dark matter search project a large and long effort has been carried out in order to understand the origin of events at very low energy in large sodium iodide detectors and develop convenient filters to reject those non attributable to scintillation in the bulk nai(tl ) crystal . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is probably the most relevant radioactive contaminant in the bulk for nai(tl ) detectors because of its important contribution to the background at very low energy . </S>",
