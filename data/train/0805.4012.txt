    "ionizing radiation from star - forming galaxies is a likely primary source of cosmic reionization .",
    "although the ratio of the flux density of lyman continuum escaping from a galaxy to that produced in the galaxy , the so - called escape fraction ( @xmath5 ) , is a key parameter for evaluating the contribution of galaxies to cosmic reionization , it has been poorly constrained due to the fact that lyman continuum photons are easily absorbed by the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "direct observations of lyman continuum from galaxies at @xmath6 are virtually impossible because of a rapid increase in the number density of lyman limit systems toward high redshifts @xcite .",

    "we also executed a detection test using a negative image in nb359 and found that a probability of spurious detection at @xmath31 level is @xmath35% .",

    "in addition , the object ssa22a - c49 , detected in lyman continuum by s06 , has 2.95@xmath27 significance in our image .",
    "the measured flux density within the 1.2 aperture ( @xmath38 @xmath39jy ) is consistent with that measured with a long - slit spectroscopy by s06 ( @xmath40 @xmath39jy ) .",

    "on the other hand , we could not find any significant signal in nb359 at the position of ssa22a - d3 which is another object detected in lyman continuum by s06 .",
    "since the 3@xmath27 detection limit within 1.2 aperture at the position of this object ( @xmath41 @xmath39jy ) is well below the flux density reported by s06 ( @xmath42 @xmath39jy ) , it is not clear why the object is not visible in our nb359 image .",
    "the images of ssa22a - d3 are also presented in figure [ fig : montage2 ] .",
    "all of the 10 laes detected in nb359 show a prominent emission line around 497 nm in their spectra taken with focas and deimos , but continua are not well detected due to their faintness .",
    "all but one spectrum of these 10 objects have a resolution high enough to distinguish the doublet if the emission line detected with the nb497 filter is [ o ii ] @xmath433727 at @xmath44 , and we find no such feature .",
    "however , there is still a possibility that they are agns at lower redshifts if the emission line is c iv @xmath431549 at @xmath45 , [ c iii ] @xmath46 at @xmath47 or mg ii @xmath432798 at @xmath48 , although some of them show a spatially extended emission in the nb497 image .",
    "unfortunately , the wavelength coverage of the spectra obtained so far is too narrow to definitely rule out the low redshift possibility .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy would be required to clarify whether these objects are really laes at @xmath49 .",
    "if a faint foreground object lies very close to an object at @xmath3 , they might mimic lyman continuum in our nb359 , and it would be difficult to distinguish it at longer wavelengths if the object at @xmath3 is brighter than the foreground object .",
    "@xcite discussed such a possibility of contamination by faint foreground objects in the @xmath1 lyman continuum survey .",
    "following @xcite , we roughly estimate the probability of such a case by assuming a surface density of faint galaxies and their spatial distribution to be uncorrelated with the @xmath1 objects .",
    "the apparent magnitudes of galaxies detected in nb359 range from 26.5 mag to 27.5 mag .",
    "the surface number density of galaxies in this magnitude range from @xmath30-band number count by @xcite is @xmath50 mag@xmath51 deg@xmath52 . if we consider that a foreground object within a 1.0 radius can not be distinguished in our nb359 image , each object has @xmath532.4% chance of such foreground contamination .",
    "since we have 198 spectroscopic sample galaxies , several objects among the galaxies detected in nb359 may be explained by contamination by such a foreground object .",
    "however , it would be difficult to imagine that all 17 detections could be due to foreground contamination .",
    "as seen in figures [ fig : montage1 ] and [ fig : montage2 ] , shapes and positions of the emitting regions in the 17 detected galaxies in nb359 are quite different from those in the @xmath21-band , especially for lbgs ( marked with circles in figures [ fig : montage1 ] and [ fig : montage2 ] ) .",
    "the rms of positional offsets between the nb359 and the @xmath21-band images for foreground objects with similar magnitude range ( @xmath54 ) is @xmath55 .",
    "the offsets of 4 lbgs among the 7 lbgs detected in lyman continuum exceed @xmath56 , and the average offset is 0.97 ( 3.8@xmath27 , corresponding to 7.4 kpc at @xmath0 ) .",
    "higher resolution of hst / acs images clearly shows that in each object with positional offset between nb359 and @xmath21-band images there are substructures in f814w which agree with the positions of the regions detected in nb359 . except for a few possible cases of foreground contaminations ( as discussed in section 3 ) , such differences in the shape and the position between the emitting regions of ionizing radiation and",
    "those of non - ionizing uv may give us a clue to understand how lyman continuum escapes from galaxies .",
    "for instance , lyman continuum may escape through a chimney - like structure in the interstellar medium @xcite , and we may see the emission only from some limited regions .",
    "another possibility is that the spatial distribution of the lyman continuum sources is different from that of the non - ionizing uv emitting stars .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : montage1 ] , the higher spatial resolution of hst / acs reveals that many of the detected galaxies have multiple knotty structures and that the lyman continuum emission appears to be associated with one of such knots . note that at the moment with the f814w image we can not distinguish between superposition of a foreground object and multiple knotty substructures frequently seen in lbgs ( e.g. , *",
    "the position offsets of lyman continuum from non - ionizing uv peak also imply a possibility that long - slit spectroscopy may miss lyman continuum .      because of the various spatial offsets in the lyman continuum , using a fixed aperture size to measure the flux for all detected sources is not appropriate to examine the flux ratio between the lyman continuum and non - ionizing uv emission from these systems . in order to obtain total flux in each image",
    "we put the apertures with different radii centered at the peak of an object in @xmath21-band , examined the curves of growth in nb359 and @xmath21-band and determined the aperture sizes which are large enough to contain the bulk of fluxes in both images and which do not contain flux from nearby objects .",
    "the aperture diameters for the 17 detected galaxies are @xmath57@xmath58 . in figure",
    "[ fig : color1 ] the nb359@xmath59 colors of the 198 objects with spectroscopic redshifts larger than 3.0 are plotted against their @xmath21-band magnitudes .",
    "the nb359@xmath59 color corresponds to the apparent flux density ratio of ionizing to non - ionizing uv photons for objects at @xmath1 . for objects detected in the nb359 image ,",
    "variable aperture sizes described above are used to measure colors , while using arrows we also show colors measured with a @xmath28 aperture , which was used in object detection , both in nb359 and @xmath21-band .",
    "we find that luminous ( @xmath60 ) objects , which roughly correspond to those with @xmath61 of lbgs at @xmath1 @xcite , show relatively red colors of nb359@xmath62 .",
    "on the other hand , some of the less luminous objects show bluer colors , @xmath63 .",
    "if the igm opacity does not depend on the source luminosity , this suggests that the ionizing - to - non - ionizing uv escape flux density ratio ( a proxy of @xmath5 ; see @xcite ) is lower in relatively luminous objects .",
    "interestingly , this appears contrary to the argument by @xcite that @xmath5 is smaller for galaxies with smaller star formation rates ( or mass ) .",
    "however , we should note that , as seen in figure [ fig : montage1 ] , lyman continuum appear to be emitted from substructures in uv - luminous objects , and the nb359@xmath59 colors of such substructures would be much bluer than the colors using total flux densities .",
    "we use deep multi - band optical imaging data ( h04 ) to investigate spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the detected sample .",
    "the uv spectral slopes of the detected lbgs are flat ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "there are two clearly distinctive sub - groups of the detected laes from their @xmath65 colors : one is red ( @xmath66 ) , and the other is blue ( @xmath67 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : color1 ] different symbols are used for different types of seds .",
    "blue laes show extremely blue nb359@xmath59 colors ( @xmath68 ) , while lbgs have nb359@xmath59 larger than 0.9 .",
    "the difference between these three types becomes clear if we place them into the nb359@xmath59 and @xmath65 two - color plane , as shown in figure [ fig : color2 ] . to compare with these observed colors we calculated predictions of colors for young star - forming galaxies with a population synthesis code ( starburst99 version 5.1 ; *",

    "* ) and padova evolutionary tracks with metallicity @xmath70 is used as a fiducial one . since models with higher metallicity or older age have redder colors , this model has the bluest sed under an assumption of the salpeter imf .",
    "the colors of the model without igm and dust attenuation and assuming @xmath71 at @xmath72 and 3.3 are shown as filled and open circles connected with a solid line in figure [ fig : color2 ] . in figure",

    "we simply extrapolated their attenuation law .",
    "such smooth extrapolation toward extreme - uv may be reasonable up to @xmath75   @xcite .",
    "igm attenuation has a large dispersion for different lines of sight .",
    "we show colors with a median value of igm attenuation for @xmath72 and @xmath76 cases , with the optical depth range containing 68% of all sightlines of monte - carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the shaded area shows colors of model galaxies which can be explained with dust and/or igm attenuation .",
    "the dashed line in the area indicates colors with igm opacity with 1% probability of occurrence ( i.e. , very rare transparent sight - lines ) .",
    "the @xmath65 colors of the detected lbgs suggest moderate attenuation by dust , @xmath770.3 , consistent with previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the nb359@xmath59 colors of the detected lbgs are difficult to explain with these models . even if we assume no igm attenuation , nb359@xmath59 colors of the three bluest lbgs can not be explained .",
    "one caveat is that the model seds considered in figure [ fig : color2](a ) do not include nebular continuum .",
    "the output seds by starburst99 code have nebular continuum emission assuming all stellar ionizing photons are converted to nebular continuum photons . in figure",
    "[ fig : color2](b ) we show colors of the model with both stellar and nebular continua ( i.e. , the model is not self - consistent in regard to photon budget ) .",
    "the inclusion of nebular continuum makes seds redder in both nb359@xmath59 and @xmath65 , and in this case the colors of the four redder lbgs would be explained with moderate igm attenuation .",
    "however , there are still three lbgs whose colors can not be explained with the bluest sed and calzetti s dust attenuation law .",
    "a qso - like spectrum may be able to explain these colors .",
    "the power - law slope of qso uv spectrum have large variation . here",
    "we assume two - component power law ( @xmath78 ) with a break at 1100 , as it is made in the appendix of @xcite , and consider the possible bluest color of a qso at @xmath1 .",
    "the power law index at @xmath79 can be as steep as @xmath80 @xcite . at @xmath81",
    "the steepest slope would be @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "in such a case nb359@xmath59 and @xmath65 are @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively , without igm attenuation .",
    "thus by considering igm attenuation such qso - like spectrum would be able to explain the colors of the lbgs shown in figure [ fig : color2 ] , although these objects are not classified as agns , according to the catalog @xcite .",
    "to explain these strong emission in lyman continuum without considering possibility of qsos , models which can produce much bluer intrinsic colors  such as those with a top - heavy imf  would be required .",
    "indeed , model seds with a top - heavy imf with a slope 1.0 ( much steeper than the slope of the salpeter imf , 2.35 ) have @xmath85 mag bluer color in nb359@xmath59 .",
    "we also examined colors of the seds with zero metallicity stellar population ( population iii ) with the salpeter imf ( mass range from 1@xmath69 to 100@xmath69 ) by @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : color2](a ) and ( b ) the colors of the model at @xmath72@xmath86 without and with nebular continuum are plotted , respectively .",
    "if no nebular continuum is included ( figure [ fig : color2](a ) ) , the nb359-@xmath21 colors of the pop - iii models are @xmath87 mag bluer than those of starburst99 @xmath70 models ( with salpeter imf ) and are close to the top - heavy cases .",
    "alternatively , dust attenuation law might be quite different from that by @xcite .",
    "for example , if the amount of dust attenuation at 900  is much smaller than that at 1500 , the dust attenuation arrow approaches vertical in figure [ fig : color2 ] , and the nb359@xmath59 and @xmath65 colors of the lbgs may be explained simultaneously .",
    "colors of the detected laes are much harder to explain with the models considered here . if higher mass cut - off ( 50@xmath88500@xmath88 ) is adopted , nb359-@xmath21 color of the population iii model by @xcite ( using salpeter imf and no igm attenuation is considered ) is as small as @xmath89 , and it would be compatible with the bluest laes . thus we would like to stress that , although some of the nb359@xmath59 colors of the detected objects are unexpectedly blue , such colors are not physically unexplainable and they can be reproduced if we consider metal - poor stellar populations and/or top - heavy imf .",
    "note that there is a suggestion of the existence of metal - free stellar populations at @xmath90 based on observed data @xcite . for a reference , there are three [ o ii ] emitters at @xmath91 found by the follow - up spectroscopy of the ssa22 lae survey ( matsuda et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "their colors in nb359@xmath59 and @xmath65 are 0.9@xmath920.3 and 0.1@xmath920.1 , respectively , and they are similar to some of lbgs with lyman continuum detections and are different from those of the detected laes . anyway",

    "different aperture sizes are used to eoncompass the bulk of fluxes and to avoid contamination from neighbours ( see section 4.2 ) .",
    "for the seven detected lbgs , @xmath95 ranges from 2.4 to 23.8 with a median value of 6.6 .",

    "also , five among the seven detected lbgs have @xmath95 less than 10 .",

    "<S> knowing the amount of ionizing photons from young star - forming galaxies is of particular importance to understanding the reionization process . here </S>",
    "<S> we report initial results of subaru / suprime - cam deep imaging observation of the ssa22 proto - cluster region at @xmath0 , using a special narrow - band filter to optimally trace ionizing radiation from galaxies at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the unique wide field - of - view of suprime - cam enabled us to search for ionizing photons from 198 galaxies ( 73 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and 125 ly-@xmath2 emitters ( laes ) ) with spectroscopically measured redshifts @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we detected ionizing radiation from 7 lbgs , as well as from 10 lae candidates . </S>",
    "<S> some of the detected galaxies show significant spatial offsets of ionizing radiation from non - ionizing uv emission . </S>",
    "<S> for some lbgs the observed non - ionizing uv to lyman continuum flux density ratios are smaller than values expected from population synthesis models with a standard salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) with moderate dust attenuation ( which is suggested from the observed uv slopes ) , even if we assume very transparent igm along the sightlines of these objects . </S>",
    "<S> this implies an intrinsically bluer spectral energy distribution , e.g , that produced by a top - heavy imf , for these lbgs </S>",
    "<S> . the observed flux desity ratios of non - ionizing uv to ionizing radiation of 7 detected lbgs range from 2.4 to 23.8 and the median is 6.6 . </S>",
    "<S> the observed flux density ratios of the detected laes are even smaller than lbgs , if they are truly at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the median value of the flux density ratio for the deteced lbgs suggest that their escape fractions is likely to be higher than 4% , if the lyman continuum escape is isotropic . </S>",
    "<S> the results imply that some of the lbgs in the proto - cluster at @xmath1 have the escape fraction significantly higher than that of galaxies ( in a general field ) at @xmath4 studied previously . </S>"
