    "determinations of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements provide important checks on the consistency of the standard model and ways to search for new physics .",
    "the possibility of observing direct @xmath8 violation in @xmath9 decays was first discussed by i.  bigi , a.  carter and a.  sanda  @xcite .",
    "since then , various methods to measure the weak angle @xmath0 ( also known as @xmath10 ) using @xmath9 decays have been proposed .",
    "all these methods are based on two key observations : neutral @xmath11 and @xmath5 mesons can decay to a common final state , and the decay @xmath12  can produce neutral @xmath2 mesons of both flavors via @xmath13 and @xmath14 transitions , with a relative phase @xmath15 between the two interfering amplitudes that is the sum , @xmath16 , of strong and weak interaction phases . for the decay @xmath17 , the relative phase is @xmath18 , so both phases can be extracted from measurements of such charge conjugate @xmath19 decay modes .",
    "( unless stated otherwise charge conjugation is implied throughout this report . )",
    "however , the use of branching fractions alone requires additional information to obtain @xmath0 .",
    "this is provided either by determining the branching fractions of decays to @xmath8 eigenstates ( glw method @xcite ) or by using different neutral @xmath2 final states ( ads method @xcite ) .",
    "a dalitz plot analysis of a three - body final state of the @xmath2 meson allows one to obtain all the information required for determination of @xmath0 in a single decay mode .",
    "three body final states such as @xmath1 have been suggested  @xcite as promising modes for the extraction of @xmath0 . in the wolfenstein parameterization of the ckm matrix elements ,",
    "the weak parts of the amplitudes that contribute to the decay @xmath12  are given by @xmath20 ( for the @xmath21 final state ) and @xmath22 ( for @xmath23 ) .",
    "the two amplitudes interfere as the @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons decay into the same final state @xmath24 ; the admixed state is denoted as @xmath25 . assuming no @xmath8 asymmetry in neutral @xmath2 decays , the amplitude of the @xmath25 decay as a function of dalitz plot variables @xmath26 and @xmath27 is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the amplitude of the @xmath5@xmath30@xmath1  decay , and @xmath7 is the ratio of the magnitudes of the two interfering amplitudes .",
    "the value of @xmath7 is given by the ratio of the ckm matrix elements @xmath31 and the color suppression factor , and is estimated to be in the range 0.10.2  @xcite .",
    "the method has a two - fold ambiguity : the @xmath32 and @xmath33 solutions can not be separated .",
    "the solution with @xmath34 is chosen .",
    "the method described above can be applied to other @xmath19 decay modes such as @xmath35  and @xmath36 .",
    "results from the two @xmath19-factories belle / kekb and babar / pepii are available .",
    "the current proceedings are based on results reported in refs .  @xcite . for the most recent updates",
    "see ref .",
    "the belle collaboration uses a data sample that consists of @xmath37 @xmath38 pairs .",
    "the decay chains @xmath12 , @xmath35  with @xmath39@xmath30@xmath40 and @xmath36  with @xmath41@xmath30@xmath42 are selected for the analysis .",
    "analysis by the babar collaboration is based on @xmath43 @xmath38 pairs .",
    "the reconstructed final states are @xmath12and @xmath35with two @xmath39 channels : @xmath39@xmath30@xmath40 and @xmath39@xmath30@xmath44 .",
    "the neutral @xmath2 meson is reconstructed in the @xmath1 final state in all cases .",
    "the dominant backgrounds come from a random combination of a real or fake @xmath45 meson with a charged track in continuum events ; from @xmath46 events with @xmath47 misidentification or other @xmath38 decays .       a summary of the results of the fits to the signal events is given in table  [ summary ] , where the first quoted error is statistical , the second is systematic and the third is a model uncertainty .",
    "figure  [ sig_fit ] demonstrates results of the fit to @xmath12  and @xmath35  events on the @xmath48 plane .",
    "systematic errors come from uncertainty in the knowledge of the functions used in the signal dalitz plot fit .",
    "these include the dalitz plot profiles of the backgrounds and the detection efficiency , the momentum resolution description , and on the parametrization of the @xmath49 shape of the signal and background .",
    "though the statistical error is still quite large , this method currently provides the best direct constraints on @xmath0 .",
    "uncertainty in the model used to parametrize the @xmath5@xmath30@xmath1  decay amplitude is the source of the associated error in the analysis .",
    "it arises from a non - unique choice of the set of quasi - two - body channels as well as uncertainty in parametrization of some components ( non - resonant amplitude , for example ) . to evaluate this uncertainty",
    "several alternative models have been used to fit the data .",
    "although at present the @xmath0 accuracy is dominated by the statistical uncertainty , the model error will eventually dominate as the experimental statistics increase .",
    "a model independent way to extract @xmath0 has been proposed in ref .",
    "the idea is that in addition to flavor tagged @xmath5@xmath30@xmath1  decays , one can use @xmath8 tagged decays to @xmath1 from the @xmath50 process .",
    "combining the two data sets the amplitude and phase could be measured for each point on the dalitz plot in a model independent way .",
    "study with monte carlo simulations indicates that with with 50 ab@xmath51 of data @xmath0 can be measured with a total accuracy of better than 2 degrees ."
