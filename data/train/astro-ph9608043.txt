    "the mass in the dark halos around individual field galaxies has long been debated . while there are compelling kinematic data on our own galaxy ( fich & tremaine 1991 ) and pairs of galaxies ( zaritsky and white 1994 ) , suggesting halos with equivalent circular velocities of @xmath16200 km sec@xmath6 extending as far as 30 kpc , direct measures of mass using weak gravitational lens distortions have been difficult .",
    "typical galaxies produce @xmath17 deflections , resulting in relatively small shear at radii @xmath18 .",
    "strong lensing of background qsos has provided a spot check of total enclosed mass in several cases ( kochanek 1991 ) , confirming masses of @xmath19 @xmath9 m@xmath20 within 4 @xmath9 kpc . however , the known lensed qsos may selectively sample the tail of the galaxy mass distribution ( wallington & narayan 1993 ) .",
    "statistical gravitational lens distortion in a large sample of galaxies can address the more general question of the mean mass of all galaxies .",
    "previous attempts to measure the average total mass of a large sample galaxies by statistical weak lensing were hampered by seeing and systematic error ( tyson , 1984 [ tvjm84 ] ; tyson , 1987 ) .",
    "studying weak shear at radii @xmath21 in a 4.8   radius field taken with the palomar 5-meter telescope , brainerd ( 1996 ) recently claimed evidence for massive halos extending beyond 30 @xmath9 kpc .",
    "the hubble deep field ( hdf ) data , being multi - band , high spatial resolution , and very deep  despite the small size of the field ",
    "provide a large volume sample and an opportunity to control systematics and bring the @xmath225  mass signal out of the noise .    here",
    "we report a calibrated measurement of the mass profile of field galaxies in the hdf .",
    "galaxies with the faint surface brightness and colors of the distant faint blue galaxy population are used as background galaxies .",
    "2221 foreground - background pairs of galaxies are examined for the induced shear from the foreground galaxy .",
    "we compare our result for the hdf with full 3-d simulations , with deep hst weak lens studies around a cluster of galaxies , and with broader but  shallower \" hst surveys . a comprehensive description of the cluster hst wfc2 weak lens shear efficiency calibrations , and comparison with other galaxy - galaxy weak lensing observations using hst and ground - based imaging will be given elsewhere .",
    "for this study , we used the  drizzled \" hdf version 2 data in which the dithered images were combined on a resampling scale of 0.04  /pixel .",
    "the hdf observations and pipeline processing are described in williams 1996 .",
    "these reconstructed images cover 4.3 arcmin@xmath23 for all three wfc2 chips .",
    "the sky noise on 1  scales in these reconstructed images is 28 b mag arcsec@xmath24 and 28.5 r mag arcsec@xmath24 . for this analysis",
    "we limit ourselves to the three deepest bands : f814w , f606w , and f450w ( hereafter called i , r , and b ) .",
    "we re - analyze the images using focas to produce photometrically accurate matched catalogs .",
    "the zero - points in the various filter bands are set by the hdf calibration ( williams 1996 ) .",
    "we calculate magnitudes and colors using an equal - isophote method : initial object lists are constructed by running focas on b + r + i master images .",
    "this produces a master list of objects and isophotal regions .",
    "magnitudes are then computed from the individual filter images using these identical isophotal areas , so the color estimates are not biased by systematic variations of the isophotes from band to band .",
    "this procedure yields magnitudes and intensity - weighted moments measured accurately in three bands . at a limiting magnitude of 29 b mag , about 40 galaxies between 24 and 29",
    "mag will lie within a 10  circle projected on any foreground galaxy .    in order to extract the lensing shear",
    ", we must reliably measure the ellipticity and orientation of a faint galaxy .",
    "the faint background galaxies we use are quite small : the profile of a typical 27th mag arclet is shown in figure 1 .",
    "useful surface photometry of these faint blue galaxies in the hdf data is possible only within @xmath25 arcsec .",
    "simulations of random galaxy shapes using the observed noise characteristics of the hdf field show that we can measure ellipticity for galaxies as faint as 28 b mag and ellipticity @xmath26 with an uncertainty in ellipticity less than @xmath27 .",
    "this suggests that we can safely use galaxies down to @xmath28 as potential probes of the shear .",
    "to minimize the contamination from foreground galaxies , we use the color and apparent magnitude of the galaxies as rough statistical redshift estimators .",
    "any galaxy in the magnitude range @xmath29 ( roughly redshift 0.2 - 0.7 ) is a candidate foreground lensing galaxy .",
    "blue galaxies with @xmath30 that are fainter than a candidate foreground galaxy but brighter than 27.5 b mag are candidate background galaxies . due to competing volume and faint - end luminosity function effects ,",
    "these faint galaxies cover a wide range in redshifts extending from z = 13 ; blue low surface brightness sources are likely to be at the highest redshifts .",
    "the trend towards redshift 1 at 25th mag is clear in a magnitude ",
    "log(@xmath31 ) plot ( koo & kron 1992 ; schade 1995 ; lilly 1995 ) .    using this selection , we find 110 candidate lenses and 645 candidate background objects yielding 2221 candidate foreground - background pairs in the three wfc2 ccd area of the hdf .",
    "we use focas to calculate the intensity - weighted second moment for each source galaxy image ( arclet ) within 15 arcsec of a candidate foreground galaxy .",
    "we calculate the @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 intensity moments ( apodized with a gaussian kernel of size equal to the half - light radius ) transformed to @xmath35 moments relative to each foreground galaxy center ( tvjm84 ; tyson , valdes and wenk 1990 ) .",
    "these principal - axis transformed second moments of the arclets within some annulus about all candidate foreground galaxies are averaged together to give the observed shear at that radius .",
    "this observed shear as a function of radius for all 2221 pairs is plotted in figure 2 .",
    "the points are the observed independent shear values in each radius bin , and the error bars obtained via the full simulations are consistent with bootstrap resampling errors . as always , the largest noise source is the randomly oriented non - zero ellipticities of the source galaxies .",
    "we find a @xmath1 significance positive mass effect observed at radii less than a few arcseconds ( @xmath36 kpc for @xmath37 ) . while we have not `` tuned '' the arclet color to maximize shear , if we relax the blue selection this shear decreases ; this is consistent with the blue b - r colors of the highest redshift galaxies .",
    "what galaxy mass distribution would generate this observed shear ? in selecting our sample galaxies based on brightness and color , the observed shear will be diluted by the convolution of the separate redshift distributions of the candidate lenses and arclets .",
    "the wfc2 point spread function ( psf ) and the drizzle algorithm have an effect on observed shear for arclets whose surface brightness falls below about 28 mag arcsec@xmath24 inside 0.2radius .",
    "therefore we must calibrate the lens mass which would generate this observed statistical shear .",
    "we do this in two steps : ( 1 ) full 3-d simulations of the hdf , and then ( 2 ) comparison of a similar 3-d simulation with the weak lensing shear of this same faint blue galaxy population observed with hst wfc2 around a cluster of galaxies of known redshift and mass .",
    "we calibrate the shear - mass relationship by simulating galaxy - galaxy lens distortions including multiple scattering effects .",
    "realistic simulated field galaxies consistent with mild luminosity evolution ( i m 1995 ) are randomly distributed in seven redshift shells .",
    "these simulated galaxies have the same properties as the observed galaxies ( number - magnitude , size - magnitude , ellipticity , and redshift distributions ) as found in recent deep redshift and angular size surveys ( schade 1995 ; mutz 1994 ) .",
    "the redshift distribution we use is similar to that derived from four - color photometry of the hdf ( mobasher 1996 ) , although lacking a distinct peak at @xmath38 .",
    "the lens distortions for galaxies in each redshift shell are computed using the galaxies in all of the shells in front of it .",
    "after the cumulative distortions for all redshift shells are calculated , the image is convolved with the psf , binned down to the ccd resolution , and hdf - derived photon and readout noises are added .",
    "all galaxies are modelled as soft core isothermal distributions ( grossman & narayan 1988 ) , but with an outer mass cutoff , giving for the spherical case a surface density distribution outside the core : @xmath39    where @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion , @xmath42 is the outer mass cutoff , and @xmath43 . for the candidate",
    "background galaxies , we measure the image distortion in terms of the @xmath35 second moments @xmath44 and @xmath45 :    @xmath46    where the convergence @xmath47 and the shear @xmath48/\\sigma_c$ ] ( miralda - escud 1991 ) , and where @xmath49 is the critical surface mass density . outside the core , @xmath50 , and we shall call @xmath51 the  shear \" .",
    "we plot curves for the resulting simulated shear @xmath51 , corrected for the cluster calibration and efficiency described below , for three values of foreground lens galaxy mass in figure 2 .",
    "all three have outer cutoff radii of @xmath52 kpc , soft core radii of 1.0@xmath9 kpc , and line - of - sight velocity dispersions as labeled .",
    "the critical surface density is related to the distance ratio : @xmath53 .",
    "the distance ratio for a foreground - background pair is ( cf .",
    "blandford and narayan 1992 ) @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 . by averaging over many different galaxies we are averaging @xmath57 over the distributions of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we combine these uncertainties , including multiple scattering and the focas arclet detection efficiency , in a single  efficiency function \" @xmath60 .",
    "the value of @xmath60 is determined by comparing the prediction for single galaxy - galaxy lensing from equation ( 2 ) with the results of the 3-d simulations of the hdf galaxy - galaxy lensing , including multiple scattering , normalizing to the galaxy cluster data . in this way",
    ", we construct an absolute calibration for the shear-@xmath41 relation .",
    "a total of 4368 cpu - hours of time on an sgi power challenger were needed to perform the simulations .",
    "figure 3 shows a plot of @xmath61 versus @xmath62 . over the radial range of our data",
    "a constant @xmath63 is a good overall approximation .    if we have used the correct redshift distributions , etc .",
    ", in our simulations , this procedure should give reliable shear predictions .",
    "we can largely eliminate such redshift uncertainties by simulating a lens of known mass . to fix the mass zero point for the simulation - based mass calibration we cross calibrate to a deep hst image of a massive cluster of galaxies at z = 0.4 . the same 3-d simulation is run for cl0024 + 1654 and compared with the observed weak shear in the hst wfc2 image of this cluster , using identical arclet selection rules .",
    "we find a similar ( but 10 percent lower ) efficiency for shear measurement in the cluster data at a radius where the mean shear is equal to the hdf shear at @xmath64 .",
    "the curves plotted in figure 2 have these calibration corrections applied .",
    "a minor correction is made for the field distortion and the spatial variation of the wfc2 psf by using star - dominated wfc2 images of the lmc .",
    "corrections due to the drizzle algorithm were found to be quite small : measurement of the signal using undrizzled data yielded statistically indistinguishable results .",
    "other systematic errors which would be present in the hdf data , via photometry or sample selection or shear analysis , are present also in the full simulations .",
    "therefore , by comparing observed shear in the psf - corrected data and simulations , the derived limits on lens mass are not biased by systematics .",
    "one sanity check is to reverse the pairs : use arclets as lenses and lenses as arclets .",
    "this gives a zero shear ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "another check is to scramble the coordinates of arclets in the catalog and recalculate the shear : again null ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "similarly , scrambling the positions of the foreground galaxies yields a zero signal ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "finally , each of the three wfc2 chips independently shows positive shear within 2  in the hdf . as a check on the focas software , we measured the shear signal from a set of simulations identical to the ones used for calibration but with the lensing turned off .",
    "this resulted in a null signal ( @xmath68 negative in the innermost bin ) .",
    "however , spiral arms in foreground galaxies in the hdf might occasionally be split off by focas and mistaken for arcs .",
    "the simulations include the ellipticity distribution of bright galaxies , but not spiral arms .",
    "to check this , we take wider field deep ground - based imaging ( 0.5pixels ) and run focas with the same parameters as with the hdf data , calling each pixel 0.04  and scaling the magnitudes accordingly .",
    "this generates 38900 pairs of galaxies with scaled apparent magnitudes and angular sizes similar to the hdf .",
    "we obtain a null result for the observed shear in this surrogate data : at 2  radius ( 25  in the original wide - field data ) we find a mean shear of @xmath69 , and at 1  we find @xmath70 .",
    "thus , spiral arms are apparently not a source of systematic error in the hdf shear measurements , down to 1  radius , on the scale of our observed shear .",
    "using the product of efficiency and average distance ratio @xmath60 found in the cluster - calibrated 3-d simulations to normalize the analytic expression in equation 1 to the hdf shear data , we find a best fit galaxy velocity dispersion @xmath41 of 185@xmath71 km sec@xmath6 for outer truncation radii larger than 15 @xmath9 kpc and @xmath72 kpc .",
    "this corresponds to a shear at 2  of @xmath73 .",
    "the average mass interior to 20 @xmath9 kpc is 5.9@xmath10 @xmath9 m@xmath11 . for @xmath74 km sec@xmath6 ,",
    "the core radius is @xmath75 kpc . from the absence of an odd image in strongly lensed qsos , wallington & narayan ( 1993 )",
    "argue for mass cores @xmath76 pc .",
    "the hdf data are consistent with this requirement , although our upper limits are not as stringent .    fixing @xmath41 at 185 km sec@xmath6 , we find an acceptable fit for truncation radii @xmath77   ( @xmath78 kpc ) . inside @xmath79 kpc ,",
    "the rest - frame v band mass - to - light ratio is @xmath12 @xmath80 .",
    "vla - based lensed qso data sample smaller galaxy radii and find correspondingly smaller @xmath81 ( see fassnacht 1996 ) .",
    "our @xmath81 for the whole field galaxy population suggests a halo increasingly dominated by dark matter beyond 10 @xmath9 kpc . in this letter",
    "we have only examined isothermal models .",
    "the radial profiles of our observed and calculated shear are different ; we will explore this at greater length elsewhere , combining various deep hst and ground - based data .",
    "we briefly compare our results with the recent observations of galaxy - galaxy lensing by brainerd ( 1996 ) . although both studies probe galaxy - galaxy lensing , they do so on different scales .",
    "the brainerd observations sample a region outside 5  or @xmath82 kpc for their sample .",
    "by contrast , our sample shows strong shear precisely inside this region . extrapolating their shear at 10  to smaller radii yields a somewhat greater shear than is seen in the hdf .",
    "ultimately , the distribution of galaxy mass on these larger scales will be addressed by comparably deep surveys covering hundreds of times the area of the hdf . in particular",
    ", these surveys will have to go significantly deeper than the  groth strip \" which covers 144 square arcmin , imaged with the hst in two filters : f555w and f814w .",
    "this covers 27 times the area of the hdf , but 3 magnitudes shallower , resulting in fewer close pairs . because the candidate arclets are brighter and hence lower redshift , the lensing efficiency is also reduced . for the groth strip",
    ", we find a shear @xmath83 for 492 foreground - background pairs within 5 arcseconds , roughly consistent with the hdf results , although with much greater uncertainty .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the help of tom duff , greg kochanski and rick wenk , discussions with andy fruchter , allen mills , and penny sackett , and suggestions of the referee .",
    "phil fischer kindly supplied the wfc2 lmc data .",
    "we thank bob williams and the hdf team at stsci for rapidly making these data available to the community ."
