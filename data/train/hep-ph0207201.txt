    "lattice regularization provides a non - perturbative formulation of quantum field theories and allows for the approximate numerical evaluation of the associated path integral @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , perturbative calculations with lattice regularization are often necessary , particularly when the problem at hand contains several disparate scales . in such situations",
    "it is sometimes possible to separate perturbative short distance physics from non - perturbative long distance physics .",
    "this separation depends on the regularization prescription , and in order to combine the perturbative results for the short distance part with the non - perturbative evaluation of the long distance matrix elements , both must be computed within the same regularization scheme .",
    "a typical example is the weak decay of a hadron .",
    "the physics associated with the high scale @xmath0 can be treated perturbatively by absorbing it into the wilson coefficients of a low energy effective lagrangian .",
    "the low energy physics is then obtained by evaluating the matrix elements of the operators that induce the decay . to match the lattice results for the matrix elements with the wilson coefficients , typically obtained in dimensional regularization , a perturbative calculation in lattice regularization must be performed .",
    "other important applications of lattice perturbation theory include the construction of actions with smaller discretization errors @xcite , and the extraction of quark masses @xcite and the strong coupling constant @xcite from lattice simulations .",
    "it is well known that perturbative calculations with lattice regularization are difficult .",
    "the propagators and interaction vertices in lattice regularization are much more complicated than their continuum counterparts ; lattice regularization also badly violates lorentz invariance .",
    "consequently , the standard set of tools for one - loop calculations in continuum perturbation theory does not appear to be useful in lattice calculations . in the standard approach to lattice perturbation theory",
    "the relevant loop integrals are therefore evaluated numerically , which has several drawbacks : a ) the amount of numerical computations necessary for realistic calculations is huge ; b ) cancellations between individual diagrams can render numerical results unstable ; c ) the continuum limit , i.e. the limit in which the inverse lattice spacing becomes much larger than external momenta and masses , has to be taken numerically as well .",
    "there exist a number of techniques to both reduce the amount and enhance the precision of the numerical integrations involved .",
    "these methods rely on reisz s power counting theorem @xcite and use momentum subtractions to split the loop integrals into lattice tadpole contributions and a remainder whose continuum limit can be taken naively .",
    "the number of lattice tadpole - integrals is then reduced by exploiting relations among them @xcite and techniques for the precise numerical evaluation of such integrals have been developed @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that a completely different approach to lattice perturbation theory is possible if advanced methods of continuum perturbation theory are applied to lattice calculations .",
    "we first show how to construct the systematic expansion of any lattice integral around its continuum limit by employing the technique of asymptotic expansions @xcite developed for continuum loop integrals .",
    "after the expansion , the original lattice integral is expressed as a sum of two different contributions : continuum one - loop integrals that are regularized by means of analytic regularization and massless lattice tadpole - integrals .",
    "we then use integration - by - parts identities @xcite to systematically reduce the number of tadpole - integrals to an absolute minimum .",
    "those remaining are called master integrals and are evaluated numerically ; their number depends on the theory and varies from four in any theory with only bosonic fields to sixteen in qed or qcd with wilson fermions .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the one - loop lattice tadpole - integrals relevant for any conceivable calculation can be expressed in terms of master integrals in a process independent way .",
    "therefore , once these relations are established and the master integrals are computed numerically , _ perturbation theory on the lattice reduces to perturbation theory in the continuum_.    our paper is organized as follows . after presenting our notation",
    ", we illustrate the method by applying it to massive tadpole - integrals .",
    "although this example is very simple , it exhibits all the basic features of the method .",
    "we then study feynman diagrams that involve static and wilson fermions . in both cases",
    "the loop integrals can be expanded around their continuum limit in exactly the same way as the bosonic integrals .",
    "however , the comparatively more complicated form of the propagator for wilson fermions leads to a larger number of master lattice integrals .",
    "finally , we use the technique to rederive the known results for the gluon self - energy and the static and wilson fermion two - point functions at one loop order in perturbation theory .",
    "in addition to particle masses and momenta , the result of a calculation in lattice perturbation theory depends on the lattice spacing @xmath1 .",
    "it is convenient to define dimensionless quantities by multiplying all momenta and masses by the lattice spacing so that @xmath2 , @xmath3 , etc .",
    "we use the standard lattice notation @xmath4 throughout the paper .",
    "the massive bosonic propagator on the lattice is @xmath5 loop integrals contain products of these propagators integrated over the brillouin zone ; a typical loop integral has the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the external momentum and @xmath8 is the space - time dimension .",
    "our goal is to construct a procedure for expanding lattice integrals around their continuum limit . in terms of dimensionless quantities",
    ", this limit corresponds to all external momenta and masses of the particles becoming small .",
    "we begin by mapping the integration region in eq.([e1 ] ) to an infinite volume and define new integration variables @xmath9 , @xmath10 in terms of the new variables , the loop integrations in eq.([e1 ] ) range from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "it turns out to be convenient to introduce variables similar to eq.([beq ] ) also for external momenta and to rescale @xmath13 to @xmath14 . the self - energy integral in eq.([e1 ] ) then becomes @xmath15^{-1 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\left [ \\tilde m^2+\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^d   \\frac{(\\rho_i+\\eta_i)^2}{(1+\\eta_i^2)(1+\\rho_i^2 ) } \\right ] ^{-1 } ,   \\label{eq1a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 .",
    "the representation of lattice loop integrals as in eq.([eq1a ] ) is similar in form to continuum loop integrals , albeit with unconventional propagators .",
    "the form of these propagators makes it impossible to apply the basic continuum techniques for performing loop calculations , such as feynman parameterization and passarino - veltman reduction .",
    "however , we will show in the next section that more advanced techniques , such as recurrence relations and asymptotic expansions , _ are _ applicable .",
    "we demonstrate our method by evaluating the massive bosonic tadpole - integral .",
    "although this is the simplest loop integral , the treatment of integrals with external momenta and different masses does not pose any additional difficulty ; the part of these integrals that has nontrivial dependence on the masses and momenta , can be obtained by evaluating continuum one loop integrals . using the variables defined above",
    ", the massive lattice tadpole - integral can be written as @xmath17^{-1 } , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath18    we are interested in the continuum limit of eq.([eq2 ] ) , @xmath19 . @xmath20",
    "therefore depends on a small parameter and this fact can be used to simplify the calculation of the integral in eq.([eq2 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , a straightforward taylor expansion of the integrand in @xmath21 is not possible , since @xmath20 is not an analytic function of @xmath21 .    traditionally , lattice loop integrals with external momenta are simplified using reisz s power counting theorem @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "a number of momentum subtractions are performed on the integral .",
    "these subtractions split the integral into two parts : a polynomial in the external momenta with tadpole - integrals as coefficients , and a remainder that depends non - trivially on the external momenta , but whose continuum limit can be taken naively . when applied to theories with massless fields , this method produces infrared divergent tadpole - integrals , and makes it necessary to introduce an infrared regulator at intermediate stages of the calculation .",
    "these infrared divergences illustrate that the loop integrals are not analytic functions of the small momenta and masses ; this is reflected in the appearance of terms such as @xmath22 .",
    "as is well known from continuum perturbation theory , the fact that the taylor expansion of the feynman integral in a small parameter does not commute with the loop integration is not an obstacle for constructing a highly practical procedure to perform the expansion _ before the integration _ ; this technique is known as the asymptotic expansion of loop integrals @xcite . to apply this procedure to lattice loop integrals",
    "we must introduce an additional regulator into the integral in eq.([eq2 ] ) .",
    "we use analytic regularization , and replace the integral @xmath20 by @xmath23^{-1-\\delta}. \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] after the regulator is introduced , the expansion of @xmath20 in @xmath21 can be constructed ; the limit @xmath24 can be taken at the end . the result for @xmath20",
    "is obtained as a sum of two contributions : @xmath25 the soft and hard contributions are calculated by applying the following procedure to the integrand in eq.([eq3 ] ) :    * soft : assume that all the components of the loop momentum @xmath26 are small , @xmath27 .",

    "these functions are related by algebraic and integration - by - parts identities .",
    "we note that the two regions discussed above do not account for all the possible scalings of the components of the loop momentum .",
    "a potential contribution arises from regions where some components of the loop momentum are soft and the other are hard . following the above logic , the integrand of eq.([eq3 ] ) should be expanded in the small quantities ; it is easy to see that in this case the analytic regularization as introduced in eq.([eq3 ] ) _ does not _ fully regulate the resulting expressions .",
    "the contributions of these mixed regions are set to zero . to justify this prescription we consider another possible choice of the regulator .",
    "we regulate the loop integrals by including a factor @xmath30 in the measure for each component of the loop momenta .",
    "the disadvantage of this regulator is that the resulting soft parts are more difficult to calculate than in analytic regularization .",
    "its advantage is that it fully regulates the mixed regions , where some loop momentum components are small and others are large .",
    "the integrals occurring in the mixed region are scaleless and therefore vanish .",
    "we now introduce both the sine - function and the analytic regulator simultaneously to show that the mixed regions do not contribute .",
    "since the sine - regulator does not contain any unregulated regions , the original integral is recovered by the prescription @xmath31 in this prescription the mixed regions do not contribute .",
    "after showing that for non - zero @xmath32 both the hard and the soft parts are analytic functions of @xmath33 at @xmath34 , we can take the limit @xmath35 at the level of the integrand and thus recover the integrals in analytic regularization .",
    "to prove analyticity of the hard part , we use the relations between the integrals that appear in the hard part to express them through convergent master integrals and verify that there are no @xmath36 singularities in the relations of any hard integral to the master integrals . we can therefore drop the sine - function regulator and ignore the contributions of the mixed regions .",
    "the analytically regularized integral is then recovered and its expansion is constructed according to the rules given after eq.([eq4 ] ) .",
    "we now discuss how the soft and the hard contributions to the massive tadpole - integral are calculated .",
    "the soft part of @xmath20 is easy to obtain . after expanding the integrand ,",
    "we arrive at analytically regularized _ continuum _ one loop integrals .",
    "higher orders in the expansion introduce a large number of strongly divergent integrals with non - covariant numerators ; a consequence of broken lorentz invariance on the lattice .",
    "this is not an obstacle , since all such integrals can be easily evaluated using the identity @xmath37 the calculation of the soft part of integrals that depend on external momenta or several distinct masses is equally simple : this part is always given by continuum integrals in analytic regularization and can be brought to the form of eq.([eq : loopint ] ) using standard methods , such as feynman parameters .",
    "the result for the soft part of the massive tadpole - integral is @xmath38      we now consider the hard contribution to @xmath20 . recall that the hard part is obtained by expanding eq.([eq3 ] ) in a taylor series in @xmath21 ; the resulting expression is @xmath39 the functions @xmath40 are defined by @xmath41^{-n-\\delta } \\",

    "we now use integration - by - parts identities to fully exploit the algebraic relations between the various integrals @xmath46 .",

    "similar integration - by - parts relations for lattice integrals were first studied in @xcite , where it was shown that the entire class of integrals @xmath52 can be reduced to @xmath53 master integrals in @xmath53 dimensions . here",
    "we neither attempt to solve these equations explicitly nor to rewrite them in such a form that the reduction of a given index is manifest . instead , we adopt a brute force strategy and use computer algebra to explicitly solve the equations for a given range of indices .",

    "the advantage of this brute force method is that it immediately generalizes to integrals involving more complicated propagators ( e.g.  those of wilson fermions ) or to higher loops . in the continuum",

    "it is convenient to choose master integrals that are convergent in the limit @xmath54 , since their expansion in @xmath32 can be obtained by expanding the integrands in eq.([basishard ] ) in a power series in @xmath32 . a possible choice that satisfies this criterion is @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "it is a fairly easy task to numerically evaluate the finite bosonic integrals to relatively high precision . in the case of @xmath44 integrals ,",

    "unfortunately , this simplest choice leads to large discretization errors . these can be reduced by introducing improved actions which include higher dimensional operators chosen to cancel lattice artifacts to a given order in the expansion around the continuum limit @xcite . in doing so ,",
    "the free propagator usually gets modified .",
    "a famous example is provided by fermions on the lattice , where the simplest discretization leads to the well known doubling problem . among the many solutions to this problem ,",
    "the most common is to follow wilson s suggestion and add the dimension - five term @xmath84 to the fermion action @xcite .",
    "despite the fact that the inclusion of higher dimensional operators in more refined versions of the lattice action changes the propagator , our strategy remains the same .",
    "the structure of the soft part of the loop integrals remains unchanged , since it encodes the behavior at small momenta ; the hard part , however , becomes a function of the couplings of the higher dimensional operators .",
    "this typically leads to more complicated recurrence relations for the hard integrals , but the approach described in the previous section is robust enough to solve the resulting recurrence relations .",
    "we now illustrate this for both static and wilson fermions .      in a bound state of a heavy ( @xmath85 ) and a light quark ,",

    "in this situation the heavy quark can be treated as an approximately static color source .",

    "we have illustrated the flexibility of the method by computing a number of two - point functions in lattice perturbation theory such as the gluon and fermion self - energies and the static fermion self - energy in an arbitrary gauge .    in the future",
    ", it will be interesting to see if this method can be generalized to higher orders in perturbation theory .",
    "it is clear that a similar separation of the integrals into process - dependent soft and universal hard parts is possible ; it should also be possible to derive integration - by - parts relations for the hard parts of the lattice integrals .",
    "a potential problem could arise from the size and the complexity of the system of equations governing the reduction of the massless tadpole - integrals at the two - loop level . in principle , the size of the system is not very relevant , but for practical reasons , such as available cpu time and memory requirements , it might impose severe constraints .",
    "although it may sound paradoxical , more precise data from lattice simulations will not eliminate the need for perturbation theory .",
    "in many cases the nonperturbative results from simulations need to be matched by equally precise perturbative calculations in lattice regularization in order to become phenomenologically relevant . using the method discussed in this paper , such calculations are not much more difficult than perturbative calculations in continuum field theory .",
    "hopefully , this simplification will persist at higher orders .",
