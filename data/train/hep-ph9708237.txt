    ", one should be able to calculate both contributions within the same self - consistent framework .",
    "to implement such a program , and especially in order to be able to take into account effects due to the nonperturbative part of the hadronic wave functions it is natural to rely on the light cone quantization @xcite which enables a fock space representation for the hadronic current matrix elements .",

    "this may be achieved by constructing an effective hamiltonian which has nonvanishing matrix elements within the low momentum subspace .",
    "this effective hamiltonian incorporates couplings between low and high momentum degrees of freedom present in the bare hamiltonian , through a set of effective potentials connecting the low momentum states .",
    "the eigenstates of the effective hamiltonian determine soft hadronic wave functions , @xmath13 . because of asymptotic freedom ,",
    "the removal of couplings to high momentum fock states and construction of effective operators can be performed in a power series expansion in @xmath14 .",
    "a similar procedure when applied to the current @xmath15 yields an effective current operator .",

    "the dependence on the scale separating low and high momenta is indicated by @xmath19 .",
    "the matrix elements , @xmath20 mix low momentum partons described by the wave functions , @xmath21 with intermediate high momentum states .",
    "the free energy of these intermediate states is bounded from below by @xmath19 and in order for the perturbative approach to make sense @xmath19 has to be chosen to be much larger than @xmath22 so that @xmath23 is small . at large momentum transfer",
    "we may ignore the dependence of @xmath20 on small transverse momenta @xmath24 and @xmath25 present in the soft wave functions .",

    "conversely , any attempt to improve the leading order formula , for example by keeping the transverse momentum dependence of @xmath18 , requires to take into account the presence of nonvalence degrees of freedom .",
    "another important observation , supported by qcd sum rules@xcite and by various constituent quark model studies @xcite , is that the soft contribution to the form factor may be quite substantial .",
    "to make a self - consistent comparison of the relative size of the purely soft term and those containing the hard gluon exchange , one should be able to calculate them using the same formalism , which is not necessarily based on the @xmath38 expansion but which rather enables to compute the perturbative corrections to the soft form factor .",
    "in other words , we propose to take advantage of the formula given in eq .",
    "( [ fpieff ] ) , retaining there the soft wave functions , rather than expressing the form factor in terms of the distribution amplitudes as given in eq .",
    "( [ fpiass ] ) for the leading contribution .    in practice , to develop a 3-dimensional renormalization program for a hamiltonian which also produces light - cone bound states is rather difficult .",
    "one of the reasons is that cut - offs violate lorentz and gauge symmetry , and thus it is highly nontrivial to achieve the necessary cancellation of ir divergences .",
    "it is also unclear how one could systematically incorporate the pqcd radiative corrections into a bound - state approach with phenomenological low - energy interaction kernels .",
    "a simple approach which enables the connection between the three - dimensional soft wave functions and the high energy scattering kernels of perturbative qcd was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was also applied to describe the soft and hard contributions to the heavy - to - light meson transition form factor .",
    "the method relies on green s functions just like the qcd sum rule approach @xcite .",
    "let us recall that the qcd sum rule method uses the quark - hadron duality relation    @xmath39    between the hadronic spectral density @xmath40 on one side and the perturbative spectral density @xmath41 and the condensates @xmath42 on the other .",
    "the exponential weight @xmath43 in this relation results from the borel transformation which both emphasizes the lowest resonance contribution into the dispersion integral and improves the convergence properties of the condensate series generated by the operator product expansion . for an appropriate choice of the borel parameter @xmath44 ,",
    "the left - hand side of the duality relation is rather closely approximated by the lowest resonance contribution while the right - hand side is essentially given by the perturbative term alone .",
    "in such a situation , one can approximate the lowest resonance contribution by the borel transform of the relevant green s function . such an approximation may be rather accurate when the borel parameter is taken within a specific range for which the higher state contribution into the left - hand side is close in magnitude to the condensate contribution to the right - hand side .",
    "as we will see below , such an ansatz is analogous to the exponential ( oscillator - type ) model for the soft pion wave function . calculating the @xmath45 expansion for the green function ( @xmath5 higher - order terms in @xmath41 )",
    ", we can construct a unified self - consistent model which includes both the lowest fock state contribution and the higher fock terms generated by the radiative corrections .",
    "the model , e.g. , automatically preserves such an important property as gauge invariance .",
    "the latter is crucial for cancellation of infrared divergences .    in application to form factors , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , the borel transformation is used as a method which , on a loop - by - loop basis , enables to explicitly identify the wave - function - like contributions to the form factor which have the structure of the fock - space decomposition eq .",
    "( [ fpieff ] ) . an important advantage of this method over a naive summation of perturbative corrections to model wave functions , is that no _ ad hoc _ assumptions about how to connect soft and hard regimes have to be made .",
    "the formalism constrains how the ir divergences are distributed among the wave functions and scattering kernels to guarantee the ir finiteness and factorization scale independence of a matrix element .",
    "as we will see , this requires that both the higher fock space contributions , @xmath46 , with , e.g. , @xmath47 , and the radiative corrections to the current matrix elements , @xmath18 should be present .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we discuss the model and details of the form factor calculation .",

    "just as in the latter approach , our starting objects are the borel - transformed green s functions . to make a link with the light - cone quantization , we demonstrated that the action of the borel transform is analogous to using the gaussian valence soft wave function which was frequently used in the past @xcite .",
    "such a pion wave function can be made to satisfy the standard light cone normalization conditions for the pion decay constant , form factor , etc .",
    "the main advantage of the green s functions method is that applying the borel transformation to the two - loop green s functions , we generate both the radiative corrections to the current matrix element and the non - valence @xmath233 components of the pion wave function which are absolutely necessary to secure the gauge invariant and infrared - finite results for the total @xmath0 corrections to the pion form factor .",
