    "one of the most spectacular new results in high energy physics is the discovery of neutrino oscillations , indicating that they are not massless .",
    "the neutrinos can be of two different types : either dirac or majorana particles .",
    "dirac fermions have distinct particle and antiparticle degrees of freedom while majorana fermions make no such distinction and have half as many degrees of freedom @xcite . in this conditions fermions with conserved charges ( color , electric charge , lepton number , ... ) must be of dirac type , while fermions without conserved charges may be of either type . new still undetected neutrinos could have large masses and be of either type . if heavy neutrinos ( @xmath5 ) do exist , present and future experiments would offer the possibility of establishing their nature . the production of majorana neutrinos via @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and hadronic collisions",
    "have been extensively investigated @xcite .",
    "a very known scenario for the study of majorana neutrinos is the seesaw mechanism @xcite , requiring the existence of at least one type of heavy right - handed majorana neutrino . as indicated in @xcite , the parameters determining the interaction of the heavy majorana neutrino @xmath5 with the standard particles turn out to be very small , indicating the need for a new approach involving physics beyond the typical seesaw scenarios .    in this work",
    "we study the decay modes of a relatively light heavy majorana neutrino in the context of a general effective framework .",
    "we focus in a mass interval below the standard massive vector bosons mass ( @xmath10 ) as this reduces the possible decay channels , letting us concentrate on the phenomenology of the neutrino plus photon mode .",
    "this heavy neutrino decay channel has been introduced as a possible answer to some experimental puzzles , like the miniboone @xcite and shalon @xcite anomalies , considering sterile heavy neutrinos created by @xmath11 neutral current interactions and decaying radiatively due a transition magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "we revisit here the mentioned anomalies in the light of an effective lagrangian description for the heavy majorana neutrino decays .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in subsections [ effl ] , [ decay_widths ] and [ bounds ] we describe the model - independent effective approach , and show our analytic and numerical results for the majorana neutrino decay widths and branching ratios , and discuss the existing bounds on the effective couplings . in section [ applications ] we explore the potentiality of the effective approach to explain the miniboone and shalon anomalies , showing our results for the majorana neutrino lifetime and decay length .",
    "we present our conclusions in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "as it was explained in @xcite , the presence of majorana neutrinos would be a signal of physics beyond the minimal seesaw mechanism , and thus their interactions would be best described in a model - independent effective approach .",
    "it is possible to parametrize the effects of new physics beyond the standard model by a set of effective operators @xmath12 constructed with the standard model and the majorana neutrino fields and satisfying the standard model @xmath13 gauge symmetry @xcite .",
    "the effect of these operators is suppressed by inverse powers of the new physics scale @xmath0 , for which we take the value @xmath14 t@xmath4v .",
    "the total lagrangian is organized as follows : @xmath15 for the considered operators we follow @xcite starting with a rather general effective lagrangian density for the interaction of right handed majorana neutrinos @xmath5 with bosons , leptons and quarks . the following are dimension",
    "@xmath16 operators and could be generated at tree level in the unknown fundamental ultraviolet theory .",
    "the first subset includes operators with scalar and vector bosons ( svb ) , @xmath17 and a second subset includes the baryon - number conserving 4-fermion contact terms : @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 denote , for the family labeled @xmath24 , the right handed @xmath25 singlet and the left - handed @xmath25 doublets , respectively .",
    "in addition , there are operators generated at one - loop level in the underlying full theory whose coefficients are naturally suppressed by a factor @xmath26 @xcite : @xmath27 taking the scalar doublet after spontaneous symmetry breaking as @xmath28 , with @xmath29 being the higgs field , the operators listed in ( [ eq : ope1 ] ) contribute to the effective lagrangian @xmath30 the 4-fermion lagrangian can be written : @xmath31 in eqs . and a sum over the family index @xmath24 is understood , and the constants @xmath32 are associated to specific operators : @xmath33    for the case of the one - loop generated operators in , we have the effective lagrangian :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the 4-moment of the incoming @xmath36-particle and a sum over the family index @xmath24 is understood again .",
    "the constants @xmath37 with @xmath38 are associated to the specific operators : @xmath39      we have calculated the decay channels for a majorana neutrino with mass lower than the standard model vector bosons @xmath40 .",
    "this range allows for the decay to fermions ( excepting the top quark ) and to photons .",
    "the contributing decay modes are schematically shown in fig.[fig : ndecay ] .",
    "we now present the partial decay widths of a heavy majorana neutrino @xmath5 decaying to three fermions .",
    "they were calculated using the effective lagrangian .",
    "the decays to one lepton and two quarks can be written : @xmath41   + \\left .",
    "24 \\alpha_4 x ( 1-x+y_l)^2 \\sqrt{y_l y_u } \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath42 and the coefficients @xmath43 take the expressions : @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",

    "take the expressions : @xmath55 in the last expressions @xmath56 .",
    "finally , in the considered mass range , the one - loop operators in the lagrangian ( [ leff_1loop ] ) , induce the decay of @xmath5 to neutrino and photon : @xmath57    this decay mode leads to an interesting phenomenology , as will be shown in the following sections .",
    "existent bounds on right - handed heavy majorana neutrinos ( often called `` sterile '' , as they are @xmath25 singlets ) are generally imposed on the parameters representing the mixing between them and the light left - handed ordinary neutrinos ( `` active '' ) .",
    "very recent reviews @xcite summarize in general phenomenological approaches the existing experimental bounds , considering low scale minimal seesaw models , parameterized by a single heavy neutrino mass scale @xmath59 and a light - heavy mixing @xmath60 , where @xmath61 indicates the lepton flavor .",
    "the mentioned mixings are constrained experimentally by neutrinoless double beta decay , electroweak precision tests , low energy observables as rare lepton number violating ( lnv ) decays of mesons , peak searches in meson decays and beam dump experiments , as well as direct collider searches involving z decays .",
    "also , previous analysis @xcite refer in general to similar heavy neutrino - standard boson interaction structures , e.g. : @xmath62 @xmath63 the effects of this modification on the weak currents are studied , as they lead to corresponding variations in the weak bosons decay rates and @xmath1 and @xmath64 mediated processes involved in the existing experimental tests , specially in colliders @xcite .    in the effective lagrangian framework we are studying , the heavy majorana neutrino couples to the three fermion family flavors with couplings dependent on the new ultraviolet physics scale @xmath0 and the constants @xmath32 , where @xmath24 labels the families and @xmath12 the operators .",
    "the operators presented in lead to a term in the effective lagrangian that can be compared to the interaction in , and a relation between the coupling @xmath65 and the mixing @xmath60 was derived in @xcite : @xmath66 , while no operators lead to a term that can be directly related -with the same lorentz - dirac structure- to the interaction in ( nor at tree or one - loop level ) .",
    "some terms in the lagrangian contribute to the @xmath67 coupling , but as they are generated at one - loop level in the ultraviolet underlying theory , they are suppressed by a @xmath68 factor .    in consequence , we take a conservative approach . in order to keep the analysis as simple as possible , but with the aim to put reliable bounds on our effective couplings , in this work we relate the mixing angle between light and heavy neutrinos ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) with the couplings as @xmath72 where @xmath73 corresponds to the vacuum expectation value : @xmath74 g@xmath4v .",
    "as we will explain shortly , we consider two situations in which the different bounds applies to the couplings .    some of the considered operators contribute directly to the neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath75-decay ) and thus the corresponding coupling constants , involving the first fermion family @xmath76 ,",
    "are restricted by strong bounds .",
    "we explicitly calculated the implications for the effective couplings in our lagrangian .    in a general way",
    ", the following effective interaction hamiltonian can be considered : @xmath77 where @xmath78 represents a general lorentz - dirac structure .",
    "following the development presented in @xcite and using the most stringent limit on the lifetime for @xmath75-decay @xmath79 years obtained by the gerda collaboration @xcite we have obtained the following bounds on the @xmath80 @xmath81    the lowest order contribution to @xmath82-decay from the considered effective operators comes from those containing the @xmath1 field and the 4-fermion operators with quarks @xmath83 , @xmath84 , the lepton @xmath4 and the majorana neutrino @xmath5 .",
    "these operators contribute to the effective hamiltonian , with @xmath85 .",
    "thus we can translate the limit coming from @xmath80 on @xmath86 which , for @xmath87 t@xmath4v , is @xmath88       as will be explained in sec [ applications ] , the relevant majorana neutrino mass range for considering this heavy neutral particle as a solution to the miniboone anomaly is @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "the experimental bounds for this mass values are exhaustively discussed in @xcite and references therein .",
    "taking into account that the miniboone experiment deals with muon - type neutrinos , we now discuss the bounds on the @xmath70 mixings , which are not constrained by @xmath82-decay , and are most restrictive than the existing ones for the third fermion family .    as can be seen in @xcite ,",
    "the existing bounds for @xmath70 for @xmath90 m@xmath4v come from beam dump experiments as nutev @xcite , charm ii @xcite and bebc @xcite , rare lepton number violating ( lnv ) meson decays at lhcb @xcite and from colliders as those from delphi @xcite . in the case of the heavy majorana neutrino with effective interactions we are considering",
    ", the clear dominance of the neutrino plus photon channel found in makes the beam dump and rare lnv experiments bounds inapplicable , as this decay mode to invisible particles is not considered in those analysis , and can considerably alter the number of events found for @xmath5 decays inside the detectors @xcite .    in the light of this discussion",
    ", we consider the bounds from delphi @xcite , following the treatment made in @xcite . in our case , for only one heavy majorana neutrino we have : @xmath91 and the allowed values for the mixings are of order : @xmath92 for the lepton - flavor - violating processes e.g. @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , which are induced by the quantum effect of the heavy neutrinos , we have very weak bounds for @xmath96 @xcite .    thus , the bound in can be translated to the constants @xmath97 , and we have for @xmath87 t@xmath4v @xmath98    for completion we have explicitly calculated the bounds that can be inferred from the single @xmath99 and pair @xmath100 `` excited '' neutrino production searches at lep @xcite",
    ". the first process can be generated by one - loop level effective operators giving the terms in the lagrangian .",
    "as the one loop level couplings are supressed by the factor @xmath68 , the corresponding bound for the couplings @xmath101 is absorbed by the @xmath102 multpliying the bounds , so that the collider value is still more stringent .",
    "it is important to mention that other effective operators ( 4-fermion operators in ) contribute to the @xmath103 and @xmath104 production at lep , but at the @xmath64 peak they give less restrictive bounds than the ones in . for the decay @xmath100",
    ", we have a direct contribution from the tree level operator @xmath105 , giving @xmath106 a conservative limit for any @xmath107 mass is @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "this result is model - independent and holds for the production of a pair of heavy neutral objects decaying into a photon and a light invisible particle . for the low @xmath109 values considered in this work",
    ", we can take @xmath110 and the corresponding bound is @xmath111 , more restricting than the bound in , but not taken into account , as the corresponding operator does not contribute to the @xmath5 decay .    in order to simplify the discussion , for the numerical evaluation we only consider the two following situations . in the set we call *",
    "a * the couplings associated to the operators that contribute to the @xmath75-decay ( @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) for the fisrst family are restricted to the corresponding bound @xmath117 and the other constants are restricted to the bound determined by colliders @xmath118 . in the case of the set called * b * all the couplings are restricted to the @xmath75 bound @xmath117 which is the most stringent . for the 1-loop generated operators we consider the coupling constant as @xmath119 times the corresponding tree level coupling : @xmath120 .",
    "thus , for the operators @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , which contribute to @xmath75 we have @xmath124 for fermions of the first family . for the remaining operators we take @xmath125 in the sets * a * and * b * respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : br_wth ] we show the results for the majorana neutrino decay presented in sec .",
    "[ decay_widths ] .",
    "figure [ fig : branching ] shows the branching ratio as a function of the majorana neutrino mass @xmath107 .",
    "the decay is calculated for different values of the constants @xmath126 .",
    "we show the branching ratios for both sets * a * and * b*. it can be seen that , for low masses , the dominant channel is the decay of @xmath5 to photon and neutrino .",
    "figure [ fig : width ] shows the total decay width dependence on the mass for both coupling sets considered .    taking the values of the couplings @xmath127 to be equal for every family @xmath24 , and also for every tree level coupling @xmath128 , and taking",
    "the one - loop generated couplings as @xmath129 , we derived an approximated expression for the ratio between the widths @xmath130 in and @xmath131 in : @xmath132 this limiting value explains the behavior found in fig.[fig : br_wth ] for low majorana neutrino masses , showing the neutrino plus photon decay channel is clearly dominating .",
    "this is an interesting fact since we have a new source of photons , leading to a very rich phenomenology discussed in the next section .",
    "searches for heavy neutrinos often rely on their possibility to decay to detectable particles .",
    "the interpretation of the corresponding results for such searches requires a model for the decay of the heavy neutrino .",
    "several explanations to different kind of problems seem related to weakly interacting neutral particles , like new neutrinos .",
    "in particular the miniboone @xcite anomaly or the observation of sub - horizontal air - showers by cherenkov telescope shalon @xcite have possible explanations by long lived neutral particles like the one studied in this work .",
    "the miniboone experiment was built to search for @xmath133 conversion , in order to confirm or refute the previous results of lnsd , which were inconsistent with global neutrino oscillation data @xcite .",
    "the miniboone anomaly consists in an unexplained excess of low energy electron - like events in charge - current quasi - elastic electron neutrino events over the expected standard neutrino interactions @xcite .",
    "this excess of electron - like events could be caused by the decay of a heavy neutrino .",
    "this solution was proposed by gninenko @xcite in a model with sterile neutrino mixed with the standard neutrinos by a matrix @xmath134 .",
    "he finds that @xmath5 with @xmath135 could explain the anomaly , as the excess of electron - like events in the @xmath11 beam could be caused by the decay of a heavy neutrino with a radiative dominant decay mode @xmath136 where the final photon would be converted into an @xmath137 pair with a small opening angle , indistinguishable from an electron in the detector .",
    "this is called a converted photon .",
    "the gninenko analysis is based on the assumption that the heavy neutrino radiative decay is dominant .",
    "the effect of the mentioned strong radiative decay is the flux attenuation by @xmath5 decay and then the decrease of the signal events in the detector .",
    "the consequences are less restrictive bounds on @xmath138 @xcite , as we explained in sec.[bounds ] .",
    "the proposal is then that the excess of events observed by miniboone could originate from converted photons and not from electrons .",
    "the future experiment microboone will provide a test to this proposal , as it will be able to separate photons from electrons or positrons @xcite .    in the context of the effective interactions considered in this work",
    ", one has to check if the @xmath139 is the dominant decay , by comparing the decay of @xmath5 to pions , which is the correct hadronic final state for the low masses studied here .",
    "we have found that the corresponding decay is mainly given by @xmath140 \\times \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\sqrt{\\left(1+\\frac{m_l^2}{m_n^2}-\\frac{m_{\\pi}^2}{m_n^2}\\right)^2 - 4 \\frac{m_l^2}{m_n^2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the mass range proposed @xcite we find that the ratio of the branching ratios for the different decay channels is @xmath141 and @xmath142 thus confirming the dominance of the radiative decay @xmath139 .",
    "the heavy neutrino @xmath5 could be directly produced by the @xmath11 in neutrino - nucleon reactions by the effective operators @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 , with the subsequent decay and photon conversion as we show in fig.([fig : nc ] ) .",
    "the excess of @xmath146 events is related to the relative magnitude between the standard model neutral current ( sm nc ) @xmath147 process and the effective nc - like @xmath5 production @xmath148 being @xmath149 a nucleon . for the effective operator we have a 4-fermion contribution with intensity @xmath150 and for the sm - nc @xmath151 .",
    "then the amplitude ratio is @xmath152 and the @xmath5 production is weighed by the factor @xmath153 relative to the sm - nc @xmath11 scattering .",
    "the constant @xmath154 plays the role of the mixing matrix @xmath155 in the gninenko @xcite work , and then the value @xmath155 found in is consistent with the allowed value by the collider bound of @xcite .",
    "the constraint for the lifetime of the heavy neutrino in must also be fulfilled in order to consider the @xmath5 effective radiative decay as an alternative explanation for the miniboone anomaly . in fig.([fig : tau ] ) we show the lifetime @xmath156 as a function of @xmath107 for the sets * a * and * b * and for @xmath87 t@xmath4v .",
    "in the case of @xmath157 t@xmath4v the allowed region is upwards the curves .",
    "thus , we can see a region compatible with set * a * where @xmath158 as in the solution proposed by gninenko .        as was previously mentioned",
    ", this kind of neutral particle which decays dominantly to neutrino and photon could be the explanation for several sub - horizontal events detected by the cherenkov telescope shalon as it was recently proposed in @xcite . in the cited work",
    "the authors propose that the solution could be a neutral and then penetrating long - lived massive particle able to cross @xmath159 of rock and decay within the @xmath160 of air in front of the telescope . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dlenght ] we show the decay length as a function of the heavy neutrino mass for different energies and couplings in the sets * a * and * b*. we can see that there is a region of the parameter space which could possibly explain the shalon observations with a @xmath161 .    to conclude , a few words about the detectability of this particle in colliders like the lhc .",
    "searches for neutral long - lived particles as the heavy neutrino proposed by @xcite have been studied in the context of @xmath162 rare decays @xcite , where the authors propose to search for events with two vertices , featuring the production and decay of the unstable neutrino @xmath5 .",
    "the use of displaced vertices has also been proposed to search for sterile neutrinos at the lhc @xcite , for @xmath5 decaying to leptons and quarks or purely leptonically .",
    "early displaced vertices searches are reviewed in @xcite .",
    "as we have shown , for the @xmath5 masses considered in this work the dominant decay is the radiative @xmath163 channel , which can be observed by the signature of an isolated electromagnetic cluster together with missing transverse energy : @xmath164 where the photon originates in a displaced vertex .",
    "new physics searches involving such final states have been performed at the lhc @xcite , and it has been suggested that this signal could be enhanced with the combined use of missing transverse monentum plus photons and displaced vertices searching techniques @xcite . the use of this technique will allow to probe parts of the parameter space which are inaccessible by other methods .",
    "the use of displaced vertices has the advantage that for decay lengths of the order of , very roughly @xmath165 , there is little standard model background .",
    "we find that decay lengths as the above mentioned for masses between @xmath166 g@xmath4v are possible in this model as we show in fig.[fig : dlenght ] for the sets * a * and * b*.",
    "we have calculated the decay widths and branching ratios for a relatively light heavy majorana neutrino ( with @xmath167 ) in an effective approach , considering its possible decays to fermions , quarks and photons , focusing on a relatively low neutrino mass range .",
    "we find that for masses below approximately @xmath168 g@xmath4v the dominant channel is the neutrino plus photon mode : @xmath169 . with this decay mode in mind",
    ", we explored the plausibility of considering it as an explanation for the miniboone and shalon anomalies .",
    "we checked that in the effective model the radiative decay is dominant respect to the lepton plus pion mode , and leads to values of the effective couplings @xmath97 which are consistent with the mixing value @xmath138 found by gninenko @xcite and with collider bounds @xcite .",
    "also , we show that the majorana neutrino lifetime also fits the limits in @xcite . this kind of weakly interacting long - lived particle has also been proposed as an explanation for sub - horizontal events in the shalon telescope @xcite , and we find that the @xmath5 decay length is compatible with the proposed explanation for part of our parameter space .",
