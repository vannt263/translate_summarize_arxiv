    "phenomenon of electrochromism is found in many materials such as : organic compounds  @xcite , polymer composites  @xcite and semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "one of the most studied materials of this class is tungsten trioxide due to a fortunate combination of its corrosion resistivity , sufficient light absorption and satisfactory mechanical properties that make it an attractive material for advanced applications  @xcite such as `` smart windows '' technology  @xcite .",
    "the first mentioning of @xmath5 coloration upon ion insertion dates back to the 19th century  @xcite . in the 20th century",
    "the interest to this material and its electrochromic properties revived and resulted in a large number of studies @xcite .",
    "it is well known by now that `` prussian blue '' coloration in the crystalline and amorphous phases of tungsten trioxide appears upon hydrogen or alkali metal ( @xmath6 ) intercalation  @xcite .",
    "tungsten trioxide is a wide band - gap semiconductor ( 2.6 - 3.0 ev @xcite)with perovskite like structure , see fig.1 .",
    "the oxide shows rich structural polymorphism @xcite , whereby oxygen octahedrons surrounding tungsten atoms vary their orientations and shape depending both on temperature and pressure . usually , at room temperature both @xmath7-@xmath5 ( triclinic @xmath8 233 - 290 k ) and @xmath9-@xmath5 ( monoclinic @xmath10 290 - 350 k ) phases coexist@xcite . depending on the method of preparation samples",
    "can be characterized by various @xmath9/@xmath7 ratios , micro - structure and defectiveness . under certain conditions a more exotic hexagonal h-@xmath11 phase @xcite or amorphous a-@xmath11 @xcite phase can form .",
    "the structural variety of @xmath5 offers a range of optical characteristics that is important for applications relying on light absorption @xcite .",
    "alkali metal intercalation can also cause structural transformation of @xmath5 .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath12 several phase transitions from monoclinic to cubic symmetry with increasing @xmath13 content have been reported  @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that for @xmath14 intercalation the degree of coloration increases proportionally to the lithium concentration whereas in the case of hydrogen insertion a saturation level of coloration is reached for a certain @xmath15 concentration  @xcite .",
    "based on neutron diffraction data  @xcite this difference between @xmath16 and @xmath13 has been explained by the formation of @xmath17 bonds upon hydrogen insertion . at the same time",
    "alkali metal ions show no tendency of binding to the oxygen atoms of the oxide matrix .",
    "substoichiometric @xmath18 also shows multifarious electrochromic behavior , demonstrating different degrees of coloration depending on the concentration of oxygen vacancies  @xcite .",
    "thus , experiments clearly indicate that both doping ( @xmath19 ) and oxygen vacancies can influence @xmath20 optical properties  @xcite .",
    "two general concepts of the colouration mechanism in tungsten oxide have been suggested : inter - valence charge transfer @xcite and polaron models  @xcite , the latter being more commonly accepted . according to the polaron model",
    "the coloration is the result of photon absorption due to photon activated polaron hopping .",
    "a polaron can form in @xmath5 due to electron localization at the @xmath21-states of tungsten , thus , turning @xmath22 into @xmath4 or @xmath23 .",
    "light absorption can lead to the activation of the following transitions : @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "we notice that more complex configurations of localized charge can form , for example , two bound polarons at neighboring sites , @xmath4-@xmath4 , also called bipolarons ( see fig.1b , c for illustration ) .    the presence of different localized charge states in @xmath5 has been confirmed by numerous experiments  @xcite .",
    "the formation of polarons in this oxide has also been studied theoretically by semi - empirical models  @xcite and more recently by ab - initio methods employing hybrid functionals  @xcite .",
    "more studies of the electronic and structural properties of perfect and defective @xmath26 can be found in refs .",
    "despite intensive research many questions regarding the properties of polarons in @xmath26 remain unclear . in this paper we address some of them , in particular , we study the formation and mobility of polarons in two cases : 1 ) in the presence of an oxygen vacancy and 2 ) in the presence of li .",
    "we investigate the relative stability of polarons and bipolarons and calculate the energy barriers for polaron propagation in @xmath20 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : tb1 ]    the monoclinic phase of @xmath5 ( @xmath27 ) has two tungsten and six oxygen non - equivalent atoms  @xcite , as illustrated in fig.1a .",
    "the structure is rather complex , each @xmath28 atom has two neighboring @xmath29 atoms but the @xmath30 chains differ in all the directions . along [ 100 ]",
    "we find @xmath31 and @xmath32 chains , along [ 001 ] @xmath33 and @xmath34 chains interconnected in the [ 010 ] direction by alternating @xmath35 and @xmath36 chains ( for notations see fig.1a ) .",
    "the @xmath37 bonds in all the directions have alternating shorter and longer distances and slightly different @xmath38 angles , which are shown in table ii , both calculated with @xmath39 and from the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "vacancy formation energies for different vacancy positions and two electronic configurations : @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the energies are shown with respect to the lowest formation energy , the one for the @xmath42 position , with the energy of 2.36 ev .",
    "see also table iii . ]",
    "energies along the transition path between the @xmath41 and @xmath40 configurations for three vacancies ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath42 ) as estimated by @xmath45 .",
    "the energies are given with respect to that of @xmath41 in the corresponding direction .",
    "for comparison for @xmath42 we show the results obtained by the linear interpolation method @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "charge distributions corresponding to the initial x=0 ( @xmath41 ) and final x=1 ( @xmath23 ) transition points are shown for illustration . ]    using the structure obtained in @xmath39 we calculated the vacancy formation energetics for the six oxygen positions ( see fig.1a ) and two bipolaronic configurations : @xmath40 and @xmath41 bipolaron ( see fig.1b ) .",
    "both electronic configurations could be stabilized for all the vacancies .",
    "the results are presented in fig.3 and table iii .",
    "the lowest vacancy formation energy , 2.36 ev , is found for the oxygen vacancy at site @xmath42 with bipolaronic configuration @xmath41 and the highest energy , 2.90 ev , for the @xmath47 position in the @xmath40 configuration .",
    "the formation energies for the @xmath40 configurations are systematically higher than those for the @xmath41 ones ( table iii ) .",
    "the vacancy formation energy , @xmath48 , depends on the orientation of the bipolaron in the lattice , @xmath48 averaged for each direction can be sorted in the following order : @xmath49>e_{v}[010]>e_{v}[001]$ ] .",
    "these results are in agreement with previous studies carried out by standard @xmath50  @xcite , where the oxygen atoms with the @xmath37 bonds along the @xmath3 $ ] direction were indicated as favorable sites for vacancy formation . using the @xmath51 hybrid functional wang et al .",
    "@xcite also reported the formation of the @xmath41 configuration aligned with @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "the data in table iii show that the vacancy formation energy decreases as the @xmath52 distances increase and lowest @xmath53 corresponds to the largest @xmath52 separation .",
    "the formation of bipolarons ( @xmath41 ) leads to a noticeable increase in the @xmath52 bond lengths due to coulomb repulsion .",
    "these local lattice distortions are , however , different for different crystallographic directions . in the [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] directions",
    "the @xmath52 distance increase is of about 0.20    whereas for the @xmath54 and @xmath42 vacancy positions ( @xmath3 $ ] ) it is 0.42    and 0.44   ,  respectively .",
    "we see a similar trend for the @xmath40 polaronic configurations ( table iii ) , however , the changes of the @xmath52 distance are smaller in this case .",
    "these results indicate certain softening of phonon modes along @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "they also indicate that in the case of monoclinic @xmath5 the electronic contribution to the energy of vacancy formation dominates over the elastic contribution .",
    "our calculations suggest that the bipolaronic states associated with an oxygen vacancy are tightly trapped as all our attempts to localize charge away from the vacancy were unsuccessful .",
    "therefore , we can expect that in the presence of oxygen vacancies bipolarons are immobilized in the lattice , however , the transitions between vacancy bound @xmath41 and @xmath40 could still contribute to the coloration effect in @xmath5 . to study the transition between these two configurations we chose oxygen vacancies with lowest @xmath53 in each crystallographic direction , namely , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath42 .",
    "our results , presented in fig.4 , show that the transition barriers vary from 150 to 230 mev , being the smallest for the @xmath55 $ ] direction and largest for @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "this result is in agreement with similar trends shown by the energy differences between the @xmath41 and @xmath40 configurations : @xmath56 and the @xmath52 bond length differences : @xmath57 .",
    "we also notice that the @xmath45 relaxation results in lower barriers compared to those obtained with @xmath58 ( fig.4 ) .",
    "this is understandable as @xmath45 allows one to optimize structures along the transition path whereas @xmath59 uses static configurations .",
    "lattice distortions around polarons and especially bipolarons can be quite substantial reaching far beyond first coordination shells .",
    "in the case studied here we find that the local distortions around the @xmath60 complex spreads as far as 10 - 11    in the direction of the @xmath41 pair alignment . the 2x2x2 cell used in our calculations is big enough to accommodate such a defect .",
    "our results , however , highlight the importance of using large unit cells in modeling polarons and bipolarons at least if one wishes to study isolated quasiparticles of the sort .",
    "polarons can also form in the presence of impurities , dopants or due to electron injection . here",
    "we report our results of the polaron formation and mobility in @xmath13 doped monoclinic @xmath5 .",
    "first we consider one lithium atom situated in an octapore in the supercell of 256 atoms , i.e. @xmath62 . this is a realistic concentration often studied in experiment @xcite .",
    "after the relaxation li stayed close to the octapore center ( fig 1c ) , no bond formation with the surrounding oxygen atoms was detected .",
    "it was possible to localize @xmath4 polaron at different tungsten sites .",
    "the association energy of @xmath14 and @xmath4 is of the order of 30 mev , which was estimated by calculating the energies of @xmath63 separated by 3.92    and 7.71   .",
    "further , to study polaron mobility we used tungsten sites away from @xmath13 ( @xmath64 6 - 8   )  simulating a free polaron propagation in the @xmath5 matrix .",
    "fig.5 shows the energy barriers for polaron jumping between two neighboring w sites in the three crystallographic directions .",
    "as expected the @xmath59 barriers are again higher than those obtained using @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath45 barriers vary from 98 for @xmath3 $ ] to 124 mev for @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "these values are in surprisingly close agreement with the activation energy for polaron hopping estimated from basic models using experimental information , 180 mev  @xcite .",
    "if the concentration of lithium ions and polarons increases the number of possible configurations of localized charges becomes larger .",
    "we study the possibility of a bipolaron formation by considering two li atoms in the 256 atom @xmath5 supercell ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "next to the bipolaronic @xmath41 configurations we also consider the formation of two separate @xmath4 polarons and one @xmath23 . in fig.6 we show the energies for different electronic configurations and transitions between them obtained using @xmath45 .",
    "we start from the situation when both electrons donated by the two @xmath13 atoms are delocalized in the oxide matrix ( x=0 , fig.6 ) , then we localize one @xmath4 polaron that happens without any barrier ( x=2 , fig.6 ) .",
    "after that we localize the second electron at the next nearest @xmath66 @xmath29 site from first @xmath4 , which neither involves any barrier(x=3 , fig.6 ) .",
    "the energies of such @xmath67 configurations are very close to each other for all the orientations ( fig.6 ) .",
    "next we model a transition of one @xmath4 from the @xmath67 site to the nearest @xmath68 @xmath29 site , thus , forming a bipolaron along the @xmath55 $ ] , @xmath69 $ ] and @xmath3 $ ] directions ( x=3 @xmath70 x=5 , fig.6 ) .",
    "this transition involves a barrier of about 90 mev .",
    "the resulting bipolaron situated along @xmath3 $ ] has the lowest energy not only among the bipolarons but among all the considered configurations ( fig.6 ) .",
    "the @xmath3 $ ] bipolaron is 8 mev lower in energy than the @xmath3 $ ] @xmath67 configuration . at the same time , the energies of bipolarons oriented along @xmath55 $ ] and @xmath69 $ ] are about 20 mev higher than those of the @xmath67 configurations .",
    "we notice that the localization of two electrons at one tungsten site ( @xmath23 ) is energetically unfavorable as this state lies more than 300 mev above any @xmath41 configuration .",
    "therefore , our results suggest that in @xmath13 doped @xmath5 one can expect the formation of @xmath4 polarons and @xmath41 bipolarons whereas the presence of the @xmath23 state , often detected in experiments  @xcite , most likely can be attributed to oxygen vacancies , around which the @xmath23 state is found to be metastable .",
    "energies along the transition paths of @xmath4 from one tungsten site to the other in the case of @xmath13 doped @xmath61 phase .",
    "the energies are given with respect to the energy of @xmath4 .",
    "the solid lines show the @xmath45 energies for all the three crystallographic directions . for comparison , for @xmath55 $ ]",
    "we also show the energies obtained in @xmath59 calculations ( dashed line ) .",
    "charge distributions for @xmath4 at the initial @xmath71 and final @xmath72 transition points are shown for illustration . ]",
    "we have studied the applicability of @xmath73 and two @xmath74 approaches to modelling of polarons in @xmath5 .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath74 approach with two @xmath75 parameters determined and applied simultaneously to the d - w ( @xmath76=6 ev ) and p - o ( @xmath77=9 ev ) states provides a proper description of polaron formation and transitions in @xmath5 . at the same time",
    ", this method allows us to calculate large unit cells necessary for adequate modelling of polarons and bipolarons . using this approach",
    "we have studied the vacancy energetics for the six non - equivalent oxygen positions and two electronic configurations : @xmath41 and @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath41 bipolarons situated along @xmath3 $ ] are the most favorable electronic configurations around vacancies .",
    "we have also studied polaron and bipolaron formation and energetics for li doped @xmath5 . in this case the @xmath41 bipolaronic configuration aligned with @xmath3 $ ] has again the lowest energy but winning only 8 mev over two separated @xmath4 .",
    "our results suggest that the polarons formed due to oxygen vacancies are immobile , at the same time , the @xmath23 state is metastable and the @xmath41 to @xmath40 transition is possible with a barrier of 150 mev . on the contrary ,",
    "polarons formed in @xmath13 doped tungsten oxide are mobile with the minimum activation energy ( 98 mev ) in the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "the @xmath23 state is 300 mev higher in energy than any studied @xmath4 configuration and , therefore , @xmath23 is unlikely to form in perfect @xmath78 without presence vacancies or similar structural defects .",

    "<S> electron localization and polaron mobility in oxygen deficient as well as li doped monoclinic tungsten trioxide have been studied . </S>",
    "<S> we show that small polarons formed in the presence of oxygen vacancy prefer the bipolaronic @xmath0 configuration whereas the @xmath1 configuration is found to be metastable . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations suggest that bipolarons are tightly bound by the vacancy and therefore largely immobile . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> polarons formed as a result of li intercalation can be mobile , the activation energy for polaron jumping in this case varies between 98 and 124 mev depending on the crystallographic direction . </S>",
    "<S> the formation of @xmath0 bipolarons in @xmath2 is possible . when situated along @xmath3 $ ] the bipolaronic configuration is 8 mev lower in energy than two separate @xmath4 polarons . </S>"
