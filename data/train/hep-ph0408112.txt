    "the perturbative qcd approximation is consistent with a wide range of data",
    ". however , there are two formal limitations on the predictive power of this approximation .",
    "firstly , perturbative qcd is incomplete in that it does not describe the physics of hadrons entirely .",
    "secondly , the perturbation series becomes singular when any of the virtual and real quarks and gluons ( collectively called partons ) in a process has a configuration of energy and momenta whose `` energy scale '' @xmath1 , a quantity whose definition can not be precisely defined and which is integrated over in virtual loops , is as small as @xmath2 , the fundamental scale of qcd which determines the scale at which non - perturbative effects become important . for virtual partons",
    ", these two problems are related through the factorization theorem , which states that the dominant ( leading twist ) contribution to a hadronic process at high energy is given by a convolution over dimensionless kinematic variables of process dependent quantities describing those partons with @xmath1 greater than the factorization scale @xmath3 , which is fixed , with process independent quantities which describe both asymptotic hadrons and partons with @xmath4 .",
    "the former quantities and the @xmath3 dependences of the latter quantities are calculable in perturbation theory in a given factorization scheme , which defines @xmath1 , provided that @xmath3 is sufficiently much larger than @xmath2 .",
    "processes with real partons are calculable in perturbative qcd provided one performs a physical sum over these particles .    in the fixed order approach , where the perturbation series is calculated to a finite order , the perturbative series for a given partonic process can become divergent in certain regions of phase space .",
    "fortunately , the terms that cause the divergences in a given region are often calculable to all orders , with the formal sum of all terms of a given class being free of divergences in that region and forming the term of a given order in a new series .",
    "the hadronic and low @xmath1 partonic components of processes involving the inclusive production of hadrons are contained in fragmentation functions ( ff s ) , which describe the probability of transition from a high @xmath1 parton @xmath5 to a low @xmath1 hadron @xmath6 . in this case",
    "it is valid to identify @xmath1 with the transverse momentum of each parton .",
    "the cross section for a given process is obtained by convoluting the ff s with the partonic cross sections ( the coefficient functions ) over the ratio @xmath7 of the hadron s longitudinal momentum to that of the parton .",
    "the ff s at one value of @xmath3 can be calculated perturbatively from those at another value @xmath8 by convoluting with the evolution matrix , which describes the probabilities of transition from a parton at @xmath3 to another at @xmath8 , and which is obtained in terms of the perturbatively calculable splitting functions by solving the dglap equation . however , the series for the splitting functions breaks down as @xmath9 due to terms which behave in this limit like @xmath10 , where @xmath11 labels the class of terms .",
    "( terms which behave like @xmath12 are classified as @xmath13 . )",
    "these logarithms must be resummed before the fixed order splitting functions are valid at small @xmath7 . since the cross section at hadronic momentum fraction @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the momentum of the produced hadron @xmath6 and @xmath16 is the centre - of - mass energy , depends on the ff s over the range @xmath17",
    ", such a resummation is required to describe the cross section at small @xmath18 .",
    "resummation of the leading ( @xmath19 ) and subleading ( @xmath20 ) logarithms , which appear at leading order , is obtained via the modified leading logarithmic approximation ( mlla ) @xcite ( for reviews see @xcite ) . since the coefficient functions are non - singular as @xmath9 , and the quark ff s are proportional to the gluon ff in the mlla , the cross section at low @xmath18 is then proportional to the mlla evolved gluon ff .",
    "there is some freedom to choose the mlla evolution due to the next - to - mlla error .",
    "the evolution given by the analytic solution to the mlla differential equation @xcite is well behaved for @xmath21 , which may imply that the two limitations on perturbation theory to describe hadronic physics that were mentioned at the beginning of this section are too stringent .",
    "the first limitation may be weakened by introducing the local parton - hadron duality ( lphd ) hypothesis @xcite , which states that the distribution of partons below a certain energy scale in sufficiently inclusive processes is similar to the distribution of hadrons , up to the number of particles actually produced ( the multiplicity ) .",
    "this implies that the initial hadronic fragmentation function is proportional to the partonic fragmentation function for @xmath21 .",
    "the second limitation may be weakened by assuming that partons with @xmath22 may be described by perturbation theory ( after resumming with the mlla ) .",
    "together with the lphd , the particular choice @xmath23 in the mlla evolution gives the limiting spectrum @xcite .",
    "the only free parameters are the initial normalisation and @xmath2 , which can be fitted to the data .",
    "a good fit to the data over the whole range of @xmath0 can be achieved , however only if the evolution of the normalization is modified . in @xcite",
    "an additional component not provided by the mlla was added to the normalization , whereas in @xcite a different normalization was fitted for each value of @xmath16 .",
    "otherwise @xmath2 obtained in this approach is consistent with that of other analyses .    in our recent work @xcite , we studied the mlla evolution without using strong assumptions such as the lphd or the validity of the limiting spectrum , nor modifying the mlla evolution itself . using an initial scale @xmath24 and a parameterized function for the initial gluon ff",
    ", we achieved a good description of the charged hadron cross section data for @xmath25 up to and around the peak , and obtained values of @xmath2 close to those in the literature . beyond the peak the mlla evolution turned out not to be sufficient to describe the data .",
    "the theoretical curves exhibited a second bump after the first peak , not seen in the data , which have a characteristic gaussian shape around the first peak .",
    "such a problem can not be solved by modifying the mlla normalization .",
    "it is expected that the fixed order approach with double and single logarithms resummed with the mlla should give a good description of the small to large @xmath25 data , and therefore , if fixed order corrections are not included , one has to consider qualitatively what effect the fixed order prediction at small @xmath25 has on the mlla prediction at large @xmath25 .",
    "in fact , the mlla formally improves the description of the mellin transform of the cross section for small @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ melofd ] ) , rather than the cross section itself at large @xmath25 .",
    "fixed order calculations indicate that the large @xmath25 region has rather little dependence on the large @xmath26 region .",

    "we start in section [ mitmlla ] by considering the moments of the cross section , since these quantities depend very little on the large @xmath26 behaviour of the evolution and the parameterization of the initial gluon ff , and can be easily extracted from the data .",

    "we now study what the effects of these additional constraints are , by using eq .",

    "thus our predictions will be exactly independent of @xmath8 , and the theory contains just two free parameters , @xmath169 and @xmath2 , which we fit to all available data .",
    "we find that the data above the cut is best described when the cut is chosen as in eq .",
    "( [ opallowercutonxi ] ) but with @xmath170 added to the right hand side . fitting a different normalization for each @xmath16 of the data does not improve the fit significantly . for @xmath149 in the evolution ,",

    "( the @xmath149 fit gives similar curves . ) with these results we are able to calculate the moments at @xmath177 gev , and find reasonable agreement with our previous results for @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( e.g.  that of table [ tabfg91 ] ) . the evolution of these quantities follows the data , as is to be expected since we are using the same evolution as we used in the fit of , e.g. , table [ tabfg91 ] .",
    "however , it is clear that the prediction at and below the peak is significantly dependent on the initial values of @xmath25 and @xmath178 . comparing with other analyses which use the lphd with the limiting spectrum ,",
    "we see that the data above the peak are well described , with no modifications to the normalization , while the data below the peak are not .",
    "in @xcite , it was shown that a naive application of the mlla without additional assumptions gives a good description of data around the peak region , but not beyond .",
    "since the evolution used approached a constant at large @xmath26 , while the fixed order approach implies that the evolution falls to zero , the contribution to the cross section at large @xmath25 from the cross section at small @xmath26 was underestimated .",
    "this qualitative feature of the fixed order approach can be taken into account by using the limiting spectrum , which decreases fast at large @xmath26 . in this paper",
    ", we found that this feature can also be taken into acount by suppressing the evolution of the higher moments .",
    "this does not affect the approximation since , by studying the mlla in @xmath18 space , one can see that it is formally justified to neglect their evolution in the perturbative approximation .",
    "in addition , at sufficiently large @xmath3 , one finds from the mlla that the spectrum acquires a distorted gaussian shape .",
    "fixing the higher moments and using a distorted gaussian for the initial distribution at @xmath122 gev resulted in a good description of all data for which @xmath179 gev from just below the peak to the largest value of @xmath25 , and one obtains @xmath180 gev . in obtaining these results , we used a non - perturbative input that was determined empirically at a low scale , rather than from physical arguments such as those of the lphd .",
    "furthermore , we showed that the cross section approaches that of the limiting spectrum at sufficiently large @xmath3 .",
    "we stress that this follows from the mlla , without additional hypotheses . in practice , imposing the limiting spectrum limit on the evolution with suppressed moments and imposing the lphd on the initial distribution gives a poor description up to the peak .",
    "however , a good description is obtained beyond the peak without requiring any modification to the normalization , and the best fit , where @xmath157 , resulted in @xmath181 gev , which is consistent with other analyses .",
    "finally , the region of the data used in global fits may be extended to lower values of @xmath18 ( large @xmath25 ) by incorporating the mlla into the fixed order calculations .",
    "this would allow for a better determination of the ff s , particularly at small momentum fractions , as well as more constraints on @xmath2 .",
