    "the ism - based description of an evolution of the nucleonic coupling scheme from the @xmath0 to @xmath1 coupling with increasing mass number @xcite , provided foundations of modern nuclear structure theory and helped to understand and categorize a wealth of data on nuclear levels , moments , collective excitations , electromagnetic and @xmath2 decays , and various particle decays @xcite .    in its traditional form",
    ", ism describes the nucleus as a closed quantum system : nucleons occupy bound , hence well localized , single - particle orbits of an infinite ( e.g. , harmonic oscillator ) potential and are isolated from the environment of unbound scattering states that are not square integrable .",
    "since the scattering continuum is not considered explicitly , the presence of branch points ( decay thresholds ) and double - poles of the scattering matrix ( @xmath3-matrix ) is neglected . the divide between the discrete states and the scattering continuum , i.e.",
    ", the focus on one or another , has unfortunately become a kind of paradigm . in the long term , this has led to an artificial separation of nuclear structure from nuclear reactions , and hindered a deeper understanding of nuclear properties . indeed , many structural properties of the nucleus are determined by means of nuclear collisions .",
    "hence , the knowledge of nuclear structure depends on nuclear reactions and _ vice versa _ , and this cries out for a unified theoretical framework .",
    "the first attempt in this direction came from feshbach @xcite who expressed the collision matrix of the optical model using matrix elements of the hamiltonian .",
    "this development gave a strong push to the ism approach to nuclear reactions @xcite ( see introduction in ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed historical account ) and led to various formulations of the continuum shell model ( csm ) @xcite .",
    "a modern version of csm in the hilbert space , the shell model embedded in the continuum ( smec ) @xcite , provides a unified description of the structure and reactions with up to two nucleons in the scattering continuum using realistic ism hamiltonians . nevertheless , the fully symmetric treatment of bound and scattering states in the multiparticle wave function is still too ambitious a goal @xcite .    a different attempt to formulate",
    "the ism for open quantum systems has been proposed recently @xcite within the berggren ensemble @xcite .",
    "the resulting complex - energy open quantum system extension of the ism , the gamow shell model ( gsm ) , can be conveniently formulated in the rigged hilbert space ( gelfand triple ) @xcite , which encompasses gamow states @xcite , and is suitable for extending the quantum mechanics into the domain of time - asymmetric processes ( e.g. decays ) . the gsm offers a fully symmetric treatment of bound , resonance , and scattering single - particle states but , until now , has been primarily used in the context of nuclear structure .",

    "at low excitation energies , well - bound nuclei can be considered as closed quantum systems , well described by the standard ism or its modern versions such as the no - core shell model @xcite . moving towards drip lines , or higher in excitation energy ,",

    "many - body states in neighboring nuclear systems with different proton and neutron numbers become interconnected via continuum , forming correlated domains ( clusters ) of quantum states . at present",
    ", little is known about the basic features of such clusters , e.g. a typical ` cluster size ' and its dependence on binding properties of participating states .        in standard network problems , like the percolation problem @xcite , different phases of correlated domains are formed depending on the mean network activity with respect to some threshold .",
    "analogously , one expects that the key to understanding the formation of correlated domains of quantum states is a near - threshold behavior of a single network member . in the correlation - dominated regime of a nuclear system , the percolation threshold(s ) should be identified with reaction threshold(s ) .",
    "what can be said about properties of many - body systems in the narrow range of energies around the reaction threshold ?",
    "are those properties independent of any particular realization of the hamiltonian ?",
    "below , we shall try to address these questions in the framework of smec , but essentials of this discussion are valid in the gsm approach as well .      to facilitate further discussion , we shall now recall fundamentals of smec .",

    "moreover , the continuum - coupling term generates effective many - body interactions in the internal space , even if it is originally two - body in the full space .",
    "effects of the resulting many - body interactions have been studied by considering the continuum - coupling correction to the binding energy for the chains of oxygen and fluorine isotopes @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the induced many - body interactions explain a significant shift in the neutron drip line for fluorine isotopes as compared to the oxygens .",

    "does not act uniformly on all ism states .",
    "a useful indicator of effects caused by an anti - hermitian coupling term @xmath33 on biorthogonal eigenfunctions @xmath34 of the effective hamiltonian is the phase rigidity @xcite : @xmath35 given by the ratio of biorthogonal and hermitian norms of an eigenfunction .",

    "the angular momentum dependence and charge dependence of the continuum - coupling correction around the particle - emission threshold can be explained in the same way as a characteristic threshold behavior of scattering and reaction cross sections @xcite ( wigner cusp ) . due to the unitarity of the @xmath3-matrix and the resulting flux conservation , wigner s threshold effect",
    "has a broad impact on various channel wave functions due to channel coupling @xcite .",

    "both avoided level crossings ( or exceptional points ) and branch points associated with reaction thresholds induce the configuration mixing of continuum states . for weakly bound states , only branch point(s ) can contribute to the configuration mixing .    in general ,",
    "the mixing mechanism associated with the coupling of ism eigenstates to the reaction channel(s ) enhances the similarity of a bound , near - threshold ism state @xmath102 with the decay channel @xmath103^{j^{\\pi}}$ ] , i.e. , increases the corresponding spectroscopic factor @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the wave function of the daughter system .",
    "( the tilde symbol above bra vector signifies that the complex conjugation in the dual space affects the angular part and leaves the radial part unchanged . )",
    "this ` alignment ' of a near - threshold eigenstate of the effective hamiltonian with the corresponding reaction channel has been demonstrated in the approximation of a one - nucleon continuum @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon is based on three general principles : ( i ) the branch point nature of the reaction channel threshold , ( ii ) the unitarity of the @xmath3-matrix , and ( iii ) the @xmath106 matrix structure in the eigenfunction mixing .",
    "these principles neither invoke any particular interaction in the internal space nor any special structure of eigenfunctions involved in the mutual coupling .",
    "hence , the alignment of near - threshold eigenfunctions of the effective hamiltonian with the reaction channel should be present in any open quantum many - body system which has complex reaction channels .",
    "in particular , the entanglement of ism wave functions due to their coupling to a common particle emission channel should be responsible for the omnipresence of clustering phenomena in states close to their cluster decay thresholds .",
    "indeed , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ clusters ] , @xmath107-cluster states have been found among the ism wave functions close to the @xmath107-particle emission thresholds in , for example , @xmath108c , whereas correlated two - neutron pair has been seen in the halo ground state of @xmath109li close to the two - neutron emission threshold .",

    "borromean systems correspond to an example of clustering where the cluster itself is not a self - bound system .",
    "we are still far away from a quantitative understanding of the organization of ism eigenfunctions near the particle emission threshold .",
    "the structure of the ground state wave function of @xmath109li is a particularly interesting case - study due to an intricate sequence of low - lying two- and one - neutron emission thresholds which are separated by less than 30 kev ( ! ) .",
    "this approximate degeneracy of two different emission thresholds may have important consequences on the structure of halo two - neutron pair .",
    "the relative weights of configurations , such as @xmath111\\otimes[{\\rm n}^2(0^+)]$ ] , corresponding to the two - neutron continuum of @xmath112li , and @xmath113\\otimes[{\\rm n}(1/2 ^ -)]\\}^{1^+}\\otimes[{\\rm n}(1/2 ^ -)]$ ] , @xmath113\\otimes[{\\rm n}(1/2^+)]\\}^{1 ^ -}\\otimes[{\\rm n}(1/2^+)]$ ] , or @xmath114\\otimes[{\\rm n}(1/2 ^ -)]\\}^{2^+}\\otimes[{\\rm n}(1/2 ^ -)]$ ] , associated with an unbound @xmath115li , reflects the influence of these two almost degenerate branch points on the structure of the ground state wave function of @xmath109li .    the exceptional points , whose dramatic effects on the phase rigidity can be seen in fig .",
    "[ rigid3 ] , are also generic in hamiltonian systems .",
    "they arise as a result of an interplay between hermitian and non - hermitian parts of the continuum coupling term @xmath18 for energies above the elastic channel threshold .",
    "the number of exceptional points depends only on some basic features of the system , such as its dimensionality and quantum integrability @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the precise position of any exceptional point in the spectrum of eigenvalues of the energy - dependent effective hamiltonian depends on the choice of the ism hamiltonian @xmath12 , the strength of the coupling term @xmath18 , and the energy @xmath15 of the system .",
    "hence , its finding provides the test of both the effective interaction and the configuration mixing in any oqs .",
    "it has been found recently that low - energy exceptional points appear for realistic values of coupling to the continuum and hence could be accessible experimentally @xcite . at low excitation energies , they could be seen , for example , as individual peaks associated with a jump by @xmath116 of the elastic scattering phase shift . also in the neighborhood of an exceptional point for avoided crossing of resonances , this characteristic imprint of the scattering phase shift remains , which gives a real chance that traces of the exceptional could actually be searched for in reaction studies .",
    "complex and biorthogonal eigenstates of @xmath27 provide a natural basis in which one can express the resonant part of any scattering wave function : @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 . dominant contributions to @xmath120 inside an interaction region are given by eigenfunctions @xmath38 of @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath121 both branch points ( reaction thresholds ) and double poles of the @xmath3 matrix ( exceptional points ) lead to a non - separable entanglement of two eigenstates of the effective hamiltonian which manifests itself in a singular behavior of matrix elements of any operator which does not commute with @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "these unusual features are yet another facet of the profound change of the nature of ism states close to the reaction thresholds and avoided resonance crossings which are responsible for clustering and strong mixing in oqss .      to understand the formation of a network of correlated states , e.g. , the chain of isotopes from a well - bound @xmath112li to an unbound @xmath108li , a structure of the hoyle resonance , and the radiative capture reactions , such @xmath108c(@xmath122)@xmath43o , a theoretical framework is required that would provide a unified approach to nuclear structure and reactions .",
    "such a theoretical framework could be developed based on the gsm @xcite .",
    "this model , formulated in the rigged hilbert space @xcite and using a complete berggren ensemble @xcite , is a generalization of the nuclear ism for a description of bound states , resonances , and many - body scattering continuum . in a nuclear structure application ,",
    "solutions of the gsm can be found by diagonalizing a complex - symmetric hamiltonian matrix .",
    "the ` dimensional catastrophe ' in gsm when increasing the number of active particles is much more serious than in the standard ism because each single - particle continuum state in the berggren ensemble becomes a new shell in the many - body gsm formulation .",
    "this acute problem has been alleviated by recent progress in the generalization of the density matrix renormalization group @xcite method to non - hermitian , complex - symmetric matrix problems @xcite .",
    "significant progress has also been made in applications of realistic interactions in gsm @xcite . finally ,",
    "powerful techniques for a selection of physical resonances , based on the overlap method , have been developed @xcite .",
    "still , much work is needed to develop appropriate effective interactions which would allow a systematic study of the structure of nuclear states in long isotopic or isotonic chains : from the valley of stability towards particle drip lines .",

    "formally , eq .  ( [ cceq ] ) takes the same form independently of the choice of reaction channels ; the whole complication is hidden in the overlaps @xmath126 .",
    "their calculation is a formidable task for the gsm approach .",
    "it requires a complicated change of the coordinate system which makes the calculation difficult for heavier projectiles , even for reactions with two - body asymptotic conditions .",
