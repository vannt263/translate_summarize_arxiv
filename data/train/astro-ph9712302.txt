    "the `` time '' that is measured in grb time histories is the time at which photons arrive at the detector ( denoted by @xmath0 ) , and is not the time of emission as would be measured in the rest frame of the detector ( equivalent to the rest frame of the shell s expansion , denoted by @xmath1 ) .",
    "we set @xmath2 to be the time at which the central explosion occurs , and @xmath3 to be the arrival time of a photon emitted at @xmath2 ; therefore @xmath4 where @xmath5 is defined as @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . by setting equation [ msef : arrival ] equal to a constant",
    ", one finds that the surface of constant arrival time is an ellipsoid @xcite .",
    "all of the photons emitted from such an ellipsoid will arrive at the detector simultaneously .",
    "our model considers a thin shell ( as required by the observations @xcite ) that expands outward from a central point so that @xmath8 .",
    "the shell expands to a radius of @xmath9 , and then emits gamma rays until it reaches a radius of @xmath10 .",
    "the gamma ray emission must occur from small , independent patches on the shell , which we call `` entities''@xcite .",
    "each entity begins as a small perturbation , perhaps caused by the shell s interactions with the interstellar medium or by instabilities within the shell .",
    "the entity grows at the sound speed @xmath11 until it reaches a maximum size of @xmath12 ( see table 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , each entity represents a causally connected region , and many entities can fit on the surface of the shell .",
    "we assume that each entity emits isotropically with a power - law photon spectrum in its own reference frame , @xmath13 photons ( entity @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16)@xmath17 ( primed quantities are measured in the rest frame of the entity ) .",
    "[ msef:3dellipse ]    figure [ msef:2dellipse ] gives a pictorial representation of our model .",
    "it is important to emphasize that we are considering a _ thin _ shell .",
    "thus , the four dashed lines in figure [ msef:2dellipse]a represent the shell at four different times .",
    "the area between @xmath18 and @xmath19 represents the volume _ swept up _ by the shell over its emission lifetime .",
    "likewise , the entities are small _ areas _ on the shell .",
    "the small spheres in figure [ msef:2dellipse]a represent the volumes swept out by the entities as the shell expands .",
    "a more quantitative description can be made by calculating the volume enclosed in the cross - hatched region , which we denote as @xmath20 ( figure [ msef:3dellipse]b ) : @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "equation [ msef : arrival ] gives @xmath24 $ ] , and @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "evaluating the integral yields the volume seen per @xmath26 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "note the rather surprising result that the volume `` seen '' by the detector is constant for @xmath30 for the relativistically expanding shell . during these times , the number of entities in the cross - hatched region in figure [ msef:2dellipse]a is a constant with respect to @xmath0 . in comparison , in the non - relativistic case ,",
    "the volume seen , and therefore the number of entities seen , would increase as the area of the shell increased .",
    "the time history from such a shell is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the expected time history in photons @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the photon flux as observed in the rest frame of the entity , and @xmath35 incorporates the relativistic effects .",
    "we define @xmath36 as the `` density '' of entities so that @xmath37 gives the number of entities within the cross - hatched region in figure [ msef:2dellipse]a .",
    "( the density @xmath36 is proportional to the fraction of the shell s surface that emits gamma rays during the shell s evolution , and therefore gives some idea of how efficiently the shell converts its kinetic energy into gamma rays . )",
    "the envelope is @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a constant ( see figure [ msef : volumeplot ] ) .",
    "equation [ msef : envelope ] gives the _ average _ signal that would be expected from a collection of entities scattered over the surface of a relativistic shell .",
    "however , the number of entities seen in any volume @xmath40 is a random quantity ; since the entities are independent and discrete , the randomness follows simple poisson statistics .",
    "therefore , this model predicts time histories with a mean given by equation [ msef : envelope ] and poisson variations about that mean , which would look very similar to the `` peaks '' usually observed in grb time histories .",
    "a low value for @xmath41 gives a low number of entities and correspondingly large poisson fluctuations , leading to a `` spiky '' time history with many peaks .",
    "conversely , a high efficiency leads to a smooth time history . to illustrate these points",
    ", we present two simulated time histories in figures [ msef:678sim]a and [ msef:1467sim]a with characteristics selected to match particular batse bursts .",
    "we estimate that the typical fraction of a single relativistic shell s surface that emits gamma rays during its lifetime is @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "in order to achieve the observed variability in grbs using a single - shell model , we have found that the gamma - ray emission must occur from small patches on the shell ( entities ) .",
    "we have derived two significant characteristics of the time histories expected from such a model .",
    "first , the average number of entities contributing to the signal remains constant throughout much of the time history , although the overall photon flux decreases due to relativistic effects .",
    "second , the `` peaks '' in a time history can be ascribed to poisson variations in the actual number of entities contributing to the signal at any given time . taken together , these properties imply that the relative variations in a grb ( i.e. the heights of the peaks relative to the average envelope of the signal ) should remain constant throughout a time history .",
    "qualitatively , this result is consistent with visual inspections of grbs . in general",
    ", bursts are equally `` spiky '' during the first half of the time history as the second half .",

    "<S> many cosmological models of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) assume that a single relativistic shell carries kinetic energy away from the source and later converts it into gamma rays , perhaps by interactions with the interstellar medium or by shocks within the shell . </S>",
