    "a long  standing problem in astrophysics is a result of our inability to determine the three - dimensional structure of distant objects .",
    "this limitation has often inhibited our understanding of the internal structure of even relatively well  defined and isolated astronomical objects , such as molecular cloud cores .",
    "assuming that such an object is spherically symmetric , or has some other simple geometry , often permits us to describe the object s internal structure using one or more radial profile functions .",
    "such radial profiles are frequently used to examine or model the physics and chemistry which govern such objects .",
    "it is relatively safe to assume that stars and planets are spherical or that a spiral galaxy has a disk and a bulge .",
    "these assumptions become problematic when studying objects without obvious symmetry .",
    "molecular cloud cores exhibit a wide variety of shapes that very rarely resemble any simple geometry .",
    "hence , determining their internal structure while using a geometric assumption will always yield some bias in any derived radial profile . in this paper",
    "we describe a technique which may be used to obtain limited , yet useful information about an object s radial profile function without making any assumptions about the object s shape , orientation , or the nature of the radial profile function .",
    "this is done using a single two - dimensional column density map as the entire available data on the source .",
    "a variety of such techniques have been used to determine the radial density distribution in molecular cloud cores ( also referred to as dense cores ) in studies over more than three decades .",
    "early work employed  emission @xcite .",
    "optical extinction was utilized by @xcite to determine the density distribution within a number of dark clouds in taurus .",
    "these techniques were recognized to have weaknesses ( inability to trace high column density regions for optical extinction , and variable abundance due to e.g. freezeout for carbon monoxide ) .",
    "subsequent efforts have largely moved to measument of stellar reddening in the near - infrared , allowing accurate probing of the extinction to much greater columns @xcite .",
    "@xcite employed measurement of infrared colors and stellar densities to obtain the density structure of 10 dense cores .",
    "the infrared color excess technique was utlized by @xcite to derive the density distribution in cloud cores in taurus using 2mass data .",
    "continuum emission may also be used to study the temperature , and density distribution of dust in the ism . with herschel data",
    ", @xcite were able to probe the dust within 12 molecular cloud cores .",
    "@xcite used both dust extinction as well as emission to model the column density and temperature distribution of cb244 . to introduce this new technique",
    ", we will constrain ourselves to dust extinction as it is simpler , and temperature - independent .    in some of the previous work",
    ", a singe power law radial density profile was fitted to the data @xcite , with exponents typically between 1 and 2 found .",
    "other studies used a bonner ",
    "ebert sphere @xcite to model the density profile , which characteristically has a flat density profile in the central region transitioning to a @xmath0 radial dependence towards the edge of the core @xcite .",
    "a function with a similar form gave a good fit to the data of @xcite .",
    "our technique improves on previous methods by eliminating any geometric assumptions , as well as any a priori assumptions about the nature of the radial profile function .",
    "there are certain limitations to the technique as well as criteria which must be fulfilled .",
    "these are discussed in detail in section [ cassumptions ] .",
    "the most important limitation and constraints may be summarized as follows .    * since a two dimensional projection can not uniquely define a three - dimensional object without additional information , it is impossible to obtain absolute values for the radial profile function without additional information or assumptions .",
    "it is however possible to obtain the form of the function which differs from the original profile by two unknown , geometry - dependent scalars .",
    "* the internal structure of the object in question must be describable using a radial profile function .    in theory",
    "the technique may be used to study spectral line emission , absorption , continuum emission , extinction , etc .",
    "it may be applied to any object provided it is consistent with the assumptions described in section [ cassumptions ] .",
    "we will demonstrate that the technique is useful even in cases where only a portion of an object exhibits contour self - similarity .    to illustrate and validate the technique we have chosen to apply it to maps of the dust extinction in molecular cloud core column density maps derived from 2mass data on stellar reddening .",
    "this paper is formulated so as to introduce a novel methodology by presenting an analytical derivation , testing it against simulated data , and finally applying it to real data .",
    "section [ cassumptions ] describes the initial assumptions which must be fulfilled in order for the technique to be applicable to a given object .",
    "the assumptions yield critical relationships which illustrate key aspects of this technique .",
    "section [ cderivation ] derives the technique analytically using two different methods .",
    "section [ cnumeric ] applies the technique to a set of simulated data designed to test its validity as well as to expose its performance under a variety of circumstances .",
    "section [ creal ] discusses the use of 2mass dust extinction maps and applies the technique to several clouds .",
    "we make a comparison with previous methods for measuring radial profiles in section [ ccomparison ] .",
    "we discuss the results and the performance of this new technique in section [ cdiscussion ] .",
    "the goal of this research is to extract the maximum available information regarding the internal volume density structure of an object using a single column density map observed from one line of sight direction , while making the fewest possible assumptions .",
    "we show how it is possible under certain conditions to obtain the form of an object s volume density profile function without assuming a specific geometry , or making any assumptions about the function that governs the radial density profile . to this end",
    "it is necessary to detail the assumptions used in this work .",
    "the method described here only relies on the three assumptions below which are made for all cases .",
    "assumption 1 : : :    the object studied must be optically thin in whatever observable    quantity is being measured in the sense that    @xmath1 where    @xmath2 is the measured column density at position    @xmath3 and @xmath4 represents the volume    density at position @xmath5 . throughout this paper , the    x axis is arbitrarily chosen to represent the line of sight direction .",
    "assumption 2 : : :    the volume density of the object can be entirely characterized using a    single function that describes the volume density profile .    the following can be considered to follow from assumption 2 .    assumption 2a : : :    any object which satisfies assumption 2 must be described using two    functions ; one describes the cloud s geometry , while the second    describes its radial volume density profile .",
    "we define the object s shape using a core function @xmath6 where @xmath7 has units of length and describes the size of the object s core along each direction originating from the object s center .",
    "@xmath8 is a constant with units of length , and @xmath9 is a dimensionless function which scales the core radius along each @xmath10 to produce a shape for the object . in the case of a sphere , @xmath11 while @xmath8 represents the radius .",
    "spherical coordinates are chosen here to emphasize the fact that the core function depends only on direction from the object s center , and not on distance .",
    "when working with arbitrary shapes it is convenient to define a new , dimensionless parameter @xmath12 which is equal to the ratio between the distance from some point @xmath5 to the object s center , and the core radius @xmath7 along the same direction . with the object s center located at the origin of the coordinate system @xmath13 , @xmath14 for a sphere , @xmath15 .",
    "we commonly refer to the surface described by @xmath16 as the core . in order to fully describe the geometry of an object which meets assumption 2",
    ", @xmath9 must describe a closed surface such that a vector from the object s center along any direction will cross the surface exactly once .",
    "this permits the definition of a radial volume density function that is dependent on @xmath12 and governs the volume density distribution of the entire object .",
    "we define @xmath17 where @xmath4 represents the volume density at position @xmath5 , and @xmath18 is a dimensionless function that governs the radial volume density profile .",
    "@xmath19 is a constant representing the volume density where @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath4 can fully characterize any object which satisfies assumption 2 .",
    "neither @xmath21 , nor @xmath4 can ever be fully determined from a single column density map using only one observable quantity without additional information , since a column density map in and of itself can not uniquely define a three - dimensional object .",
    "it is possible to determine the function @xmath22 as well as certain properties of @xmath7 by taking advantage of the self - similarity imposed on the object by assumption 2 .",
    "any object which satisfies assumption 2 satisfies the implied assumptions below .     for an arbitrary object which satisfies assumption 2 .",
    "each surface shares the same shape and orientation , while differing only in scale .",
    "( right ) projections of the three surfaces along the line of sight ( los ) .",
    "each surface is characterized by a specific value of @xmath12 , its projected area ( @xmath23 ) , and its volume density ( @xmath24 ) as in equation [ corin ] .",
    "projected areas have the same shape and orientation , while differing only in scale .",
    "since the object is assumed to be optically thin , the projected column densities from each surface add linearly to produce the total column density .",
    "[ cfig1 ] ]    assumption 2b : : :    specific values of @xmath12 describe three - dimensional    surfaces of equal volume density .",
    "the left panel of figure [ cfig1 ]    illustrates three such surfaces belonging to an arbitrary object , and    having three distinct values of @xmath12 .",
    "all volume    density surfaces share the same shape , orientation , and center    position .",
    "the only differences between surfaces of different    @xmath12 are in their sizes , and volume densities .",
    "assumption 2c : : :    each volume density surface , when projected onto a plane perpendicular    to the line of sight produces a two - dimensional boundary whose area    ( @xmath23 ) is directly proportional to @xmath25 .    the right panel of figure [ cfig1 ] describes such projections of three    surfaces with independent values of @xmath12 .",
    "all such    surface boundaries are identical except in their size and the    corresponding volume densities they represent .",
    "self - similarity between different volume density surfaces is a critical aspect of assumptions 2b and 2c . aside from certain constants ,",
    "the only parameters which differentiate the projected boundaries of different volume density surfaces are their areas ( expressable in terms of @xmath25 ) , and the corresponding volume density ( determined by @xmath18 )",
    ". therefore there must be a relationship between the area of each projected boundary and its volume density which is dependent on @xmath18 , but is , aside from some constants , independent of @xmath9 .",
    "_ @xmath9 determines the shape and orientation which are identical for each surface , while the relationship between the projected area and volume density of each surface is governed by the radial density profile function ( @xmath18)_.    the observable column density map is a superposition of all the volume density surfaces projected onto a plane perpendicular to our line of sight .",
    "the column density map should thus exhibit the same self - similarity seen among the individual volume density surfaces .",
    "if assumptions 1 and 2 hold for a given object , then the following must be valid as well    assumption 3 : : :    comparing the column densities and areas of different column density    contours should yield a relationship which , aside from some constants ,    is independent of the object s geometry .",
    "assumption 3 is confirmed analytically by equation [ cnarea ] in section [ canalyticder ] .",
    "the following section shows how the function @xmath18 may be derived using that relationship .",
    "no truly general proof that applies to all possible shapes is evident at this time .",
    "therefore it is necessary to restrict this analytic derivation to those geometries which can be described by a quadratic definition of @xmath12 .",
    "geometries which do not conform to equation [ crrc ] are tested numerically in section [ cnumeric ] .",
    "a useful form for @xmath12 is    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is a constant and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are any functions that conform to assumption 2 . the above quadratic representation , while not universal , can describe a wide variety of geometries encountered in nature including triaxial ellipsoids .",
    "no specific values for @xmath30 and @xmath29 are invoked in the following derivation except where noted for purposes of illustration . in such cases , a spheroid model with axial ratio @xmath31 , inclined by an angle @xmath32 through a rotation about the y axis",
    "will be used .",
    "a spheroid is chosen because it is mathematically tractable yet versatile enough to demonstrate changes in shape and orientation by varying @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "such a spheroid may be described by the relationships @xmath33    values of @xmath12 describe individual surfaces of fixed volume density .",
    "since the line of sight is chosen to be along the x axis it is useful to express the x positions of each surface with a specific @xmath12 as @xmath34    defining a new function @xmath35 yields @xmath36    @xmath37 denotes the two line of sight ( @xmath38 ) positions for a surface defined by a particular value of @xmath12 at sky position @xmath3 .",
    "functions @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are defined by the geometry of the object in question .",
    "equations [ cadef ] , [ cbdef ] , and [ ccdef ] describe the appropriate functions representing a spheroid with axial ratio @xmath31 and inclination @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath39 is a function that is entirely dependent on the object s shape ; the following section discusses its conceptual meaning further .",
    "it is possible to define an object as a discrete series of shells , each of which is defined as the region between an inner ( @xmath40 ) and an outer ( @xmath41 ) surface with an average volume density ( @xmath42 ) within the shell .",
    "the depth along the x axis of each such shell at different ( y , z ) positions will vary according to    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the total depth along the line of sight at position @xmath3 for the shell made up of two surfaces defined by @xmath40 and @xmath41 . substituting equation [ cxpos ] into equation [ cdori ] yields @xmath45 equation [ cdinc ] describes the depth of each shell , however this representation is of limited use since @xmath12 is not an observable quantity .",
    "similarly , @xmath39 is a function that is directly dependent on the object s unknown shape . equation [ cdinc ] must be put in terms of observable quantities : the observed column density , and the area within each column density contour .",
    "each surface as described by equation [ cxpos ] , when projected onto the line of sight , produces a closed boundary composed of those @xmath3 positions where @xmath46 . in view of equation [ cxpos ]",
    "the projected boundaries of each shell are defined by @xmath47 solving for @xmath39 using the spheroid model above yields a familiar relation , @xmath48 which is a simple ellipse that results from projecting a three dimensional spheroid surface onto a two dimensional plane . equation [ ceboundary ] makes clear that each contour of equal @xmath39 corresponds to the boundary of a particular volume density surface , with a specific value of @xmath12 and possesses a unique projected area . in general , the projected area of a surface of a particular @xmath12 can be expressed as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a geometry - dependent unknown constant(@xmath51 ) . all positions with equal @xmath39 correspond to the projected boundary of a surface with @xmath52 with corresponding area @xmath53 .",
    "the additional subscript c denotes a specific contour .",
    "therefore , equation [ cdinc ] can be reformed in terms of areas as @xmath54 where @xmath55 represents the depth along the line of sight of the shell between surfaces defined by @xmath56 and @xmath57 at all positions defined by the contour formed by the projected boundary of the surface defined by @xmath52 .",
    "the observed column density can then be defined as @xmath58 @xmath59 represents the column density at all positions @xmath3 defined by the projected boundary of the @xmath52 surface .",
    "@xmath60 represents the mean volume density within the shell whose surfaces are defined by @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the column density and area are observable quantities , however @xmath63 are unknowns .",
    "the relationship between column density ( @xmath64 ) and area ( @xmath23 ) can be obtained through contouring the observed map , yielding a discrete series of contour column densities and associated areas .",
    "using such data it should be possible to obtain information on the quantity @xmath63 .",
    "it is useful to define two new variables which will represent the derived volume density profile function . @xmath65",
    "permitting equation [ cncori ] to be rewritten as @xmath66    the observed column density map thus yields a series of contours denoted by their column density ( @xmath59 ) and area ( @xmath67 ) . beginning with the outermost contour with the largest area , and moving recursively",
    "inward it is possible to derive a series of @xmath68 measurements for the object using equation [ cdiscfinal ] .",
    "equation [ crn ] yields a series of @xmath69 measurements derived from the contour areas ( @xmath53 ) , yielding @xmath70 .",
    "equation [ cn ] shows that @xmath70 is related to @xmath71 and @xmath18 through a series of constants ( @xmath72 ) that are all unknown .",
    "knowledge of the object s geometry would yield values for @xmath50 and @xmath27 allowing the determination of @xmath19 and the full definition of the object s radial volume density profile @xmath71 .",
    "conversely , knowledge of @xmath19 could yield information on the object s geometry .    without such a priori knowledge",
    "there are limits to the information which may be obtained from a single column density map , however @xmath18 can be determined to within 2 unknown scalars so as to obtain the form of the volume density profile function .",
    "the nature of those two scalars ( g and @xmath73 ) is best elucidated through a non - discrete derivation as discussed in the following two sections .",
    "this is done without assuming a specific geometry for the object , or the nature of @xmath18 .",
    "this derivation is dependent on obtaining valid @xmath74 vs. @xmath53 measurements from the column density map which may be a non - trivial process when working with real data .",
    "methods for obtaining such measurements are discussed in section [ creal ] along with examples of the derivation applied to simulated data .",
    "equation [ cdiscfinal ] is useful for deriving @xmath70 from real data , and is used in all practical examples in this paper with both simulated and real data .",
    "however , it does not necessarily give the most insight into the problem . any practical application of this theorem",
    "requires a strict understanding of the relation between @xmath70 and @xmath71 with respect to the two scalars which separate them . to this end an analytic derivation is invoked in this section which is equivalent to that in section [ cdiscretesec ] , yet is qualitatively different in that it illustrates different aspects of the derived @xmath70 function .",
    "this derivation does not invoke discreteness , but instead uses integration .",
    "the integrals prohibit the use of a truly general form for @xmath18 , thus two radial density profiles are invoked for illustrative purposes along with the same spheroid geometry from section [ cdiscretesec ] .",
    "a gaussian and an attenuated power law are selected as mathematically tractable profiles that are frequently observed in nature .",
    "they may be described as @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 represent the gaussian and attenuated power law functions respectively .",
    "@xmath78 is a constant greater than 1 .",
    "this attenuated power law function can be viewed as a form of the well - studied type iv pareto distribution .",
    "it is inspired by , and represents a more generalized form of the king profile @xcite .",
    "the king profile was also used by @xcite , and @xcite when addressing the problem of density distributions within molecular cloud cores , however they each utilized geometric assumptions which we do not invoke .    if assumption 1 holds then the observed column density map for each profile can be written as @xmath79    since specific radial density profile functions are used , it is possible to directly perform each integral , yielding @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the binomial coefficient . similarly to section [ cdiscretesec ] , the preceding equation may be used to express the column density in terms of the area covered by each column density contour resulting in @xmath82 since no specific shape has yet been invoked , equation [ cnarea ] verifies assumption 3 by showing that the relationship between column density and the area of its contours is , aside from some constants ( @xmath83 ) , independent of the object s geometry .    alternatively , using equations [ cndirect ] and [ cxpos ] along with the relation @xmath84 yields the following expression for the column density which is equivalent to the derivation in section [ cdiscretesec ] @xmath85 equation [ cnrrc ] specifies the observed column density at all positions",
    "@xmath3 described by the projected boundary of the shell defined by @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath86 is the integration variable , where the e subscript denotes that the integration is performed over all surfaces exterior to @xmath12 . solving equation [ cnrrc ] for",
    "the gaussian and attenuated power law profiles yields @xmath87 equation [ cnrrc2 ] , when converted to areas using equation [ careaeq ] , is identical to equation [ cnarea ] , thus confirming that the discrete derivation in section [ cdiscretesec ] is equivalent to integrating the volume density along the line of sight .      deriving @xmath70 through the method defined above yields a function with the same form as the original @xmath71 .",
    "it is important to understand the relation between the derived and actual density profile functions .",
    "this relationship may be defined as    @xmath88    where @xmath89 and @xmath73 are unknown constants . applying the above method to the spheroid model with gaussian and power - law profiles yields",
    "derived volume density functions described by    @xmath90    equations [ crn ] and [ cgepsilon ] in conjunction with equation [ cnprimegnprimep ] show that for a spheroid model , @xmath91 @xmath89 is dimensionless , while @xmath73 has dimensions of length .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath89 and @xmath73 are completely geometry dependent and thus identical in both the power law and gaussian cases .",
    "neither parameter can be fully determined by the method described here without knowledge of the object s geometry , further data , or assumptions .",
    "as evidenced by equation [ cgchi ] , @xmath89 and @xmath73 are not independent quantities due to their dependence on @xmath92 . aside from scalars @xmath89 and @xmath73 , the derived @xmath70 , and the original @xmath71",
    "are identical . for a sphere , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "these scalars contain all of the unknown geometric information about the observed object .",
    "we may derive @xmath70 from an observed column density map , however this function will differ from the object s volume density profile ( @xmath71 ) by the two unknown scalars @xmath89 and @xmath73",
    ". the form of @xmath70 will however be identical to @xmath71 regardless of the two scalars .",

    ", @xmath89 may be viewed as the ratio between the depth and the width of an object along the line of sight , though this interpretation will rarely be strictly true . if @xmath89 is greater than 1 , then the object is deeper than it is wide , and the derived @xmath95 will be greater than the actual @xmath19 .",
    "numerical models using simulated data can validate the technique described in section [ cderivation ] , as well as illustrate the behaviour of @xmath89 and @xmath73 under various conditions .",
    "models of several objects are constructed using known geometries and volume density profiles in order to create simulated column density maps .",

    "[ cfig2 ] ]    figure [ cfig2 ] illustrates how such a model is constructed and analyzed using the simplest case of a sphere with a gaussian volume density profile and minimal noise . to produce a column density map such as in figure [ cfig2]a it is necessary to first choose a geometry ( in this case a sphere ) and a volume density profile function ( in this case a gaussian ) and construct a three - dimensional array whose elements represent the object s volume density",
    "this array is then integrated along the line of sight to produce a column density map .",
    "normally distributed noise with mean zero and a certain standard deviation ( 1% of the maximum column density in the case of figure [ cfig2]a ) is then added to the column density map . selected contour levels are drawn for illustration purposes to produce a map as in figure [ cfig2]a .",
    "such column density maps are the only source of information for further model analysis , as knowledge of model scalars such as @xmath8 and @xmath19 is used only for the purposes of scaling the plots .",
    "many column density contours ( not drawn ) are measured on the map in order to produce a plot of column density ( @xmath64 ) versus contour area ( @xmath23 ) as in figure [ cfig2]b .",
    "it is impossible to properly sample the whole range of column densities without a priori knowledge of the volume density profile function .",
    "we found it most appropriate to measure the same number of contours as the number of pixels that span the object , and to space them equally in column density .",
    "this choice often results in oversampling , as discussed in section [ cuncertainty ] , but has been experimentally found to be the most useful .",
    "the technique described here requires implicitly that all column density contours exhibit self - similarity , sharing the same shape , orientation , and center position .",
    "the suitability of an object to this analysis technique may be verified by comparing the contours .",
    "similarly , it is necessary to remove from consideration any contours which are created by noise in the column density map .",
    "figure [ cfig2]c illustrates how these requirements are satisfied .",
    "each contour is scaled to the same size , translated to the same center position , and then plotted so as to overlap as in figure [ cfig2]c .",
    "the innermost third of the contours with the smallest area are colored red , while the outermost third are colored blue , and intermediate contours are colored green . in the case of figure",
    "[ cfig2]c the simulated noise is quite low and thus only the innermost ( smallest ) contours display any deviations from a circle .",
    "these variations are due to the small number of pixels within the smallest contours .",
    "this representation is useful in that any deviations from a single contour shape and orientation may be easily identified .",
    "a simple method for numerically filtering out noise - induced contours from consideration is to compare the geometric centers of each contour to the geometric center of mass for the object from the column density map .",
    "any contours whose centers exceed some small distance from the center of mass are excluded .",
    "figure [ cfig2]c represents the object s center of mass as the dashed cross in the center .",
    "the center positions of each contour are plotted in relation to the center of mass with the green , red , and blue colors representing the contours with the smallest , intermediate , and largest areas respectively .",
    "the solid black circle represents the radius used to filter out questionable contours .",
    "the square represents the relative position and scale of the pixel from the column density map which contains the object s center of mass .",
    "this diagnostic plot is useful in determining how well a given object complies with assumption 2 , as well as which contours are suitable for analysis .",
    "once all unsuitable column density contours are removed from consideration it is possible to apply equations [ crn ] and [ cdiscfinal ] recursively to the @xmath64 and @xmath23 pairs in order to derive @xmath70 as in figure [ cfig2]d .",
    "since modeled data is used here it is possible to directly determine the values of @xmath89 and @xmath73 as well as to scale @xmath99 and @xmath70 using the known values of @xmath8 and @xmath19 as in figure [ cfig2]d .",
    "figure [ cfig2 ] verifies that the derived @xmath70 has the same form as the original @xmath71 function to a very high degree for the low - noise sphere with a gaussian profile function . as expected , @xmath100 and @xmath94 .",

    "_ inhomogeneities in contour shape invalidate this technique_. figures [ cfig4]c - d show such a geometric shape which utilizes the same quadratic definition for @xmath12 as in equation [ crrc ] where @xmath112    in this case , @xmath27 is not a constant , the object does not produce self - similar contours , and our technique fails to reproduce the correct radial profile as seen in figure [ cfig4]d .",
    "it is important to note however , that the inner - most and outer - most regions ( where there contours are self - similar ) do correctly reproduce the original profile function .",
    "fortunately , the influence of each individual contour of the overall density profile is limited .",
    "each contour only affects contours interior to itself , and has the greatest influence on adjacent contours .",
    "thus , in our derivation , as one moves from the outermost shells to the innermost , a change in the value of @xmath50 will only begin to have an effect at the contour where the change first occurs , and its influence will decline as we move further into the interior .",
    "we refer to this change in contour shape as an @xmath50 discontinuity . assuming only one such discontinuity occurs within a given map (",
    "so that there are only two contour shapes present ) , the derived volume density profile should still be correct in the region outside of the discontinuity .",
    "the discontinuity will invalidate the derived profile interior to itself , but as its influence weakens the innermost region of the derived profile may still be accurate , as in figure [ cfig4]d .",
    "this phenomenon is frequently present when dealing with real data , and is illustrated further in section [ creal ] , but it only prohibits us from accurately obtaining @xmath70 in those portions of the profile where @xmath50 discontinuities occur . @xmath50 discontinuities are simple to identify visually through plots such as figure 2c , and numerically by calculating the values of @xmath50 for each contour .",
    "sections [ cderivation ] and [ cnumeric ] have proven that our technique can accurately derive the form of the radial volume density profile under idealized conditions .",
    "such circumstances rarely occur in nature so it is important to be able to distinguish real data from noise and systematic effects .",
    "ideally , one would assign an uncertainty to each measurement in the derived profile to determine which points are likely to represent real measurements .",
    "however , a serious shortcoming of our method here is that we are unable to assign such uncertainties .",
    "many methods were tried , but the root problem is that we are unable to properly assign an accurate uncertainty to the @xmath64 vs. @xmath23 measurements for the contours . even assuming that all contours ultimately have the same shape , systematic noise affects them in ways that are difficult to quantify .",
    "each of the above simulated data sets , are made with different levels of systematic noise in order to illustrate its effects on the solutions .",
    "figure [ cfig2 ] has minimal noise equivalent to @xmath113 of the peak intensity , resulting in a near perfect derived profile .",
    "figures [ cfig3]a - b contain @xmath114 noise which is sufficient to add some irregularity to the shapes of the observed contours .",
    "those irregularities are most evident in the smallest contours , and are seen as slight offsets in the innermost regions of the radial density profile .    the @xmath115 noise map in figures [ cfig3]c - d shows a new phenomenon . here , the noise is such that the innermost contour is broken into two pieces which are unusable . as a result , the derived profile has no measurements interior to @xmath116 .",
    "further , there are larger irregularities in the derived profile .",
    "these are caused by individual pixels with a significantly different signal compared to their surroundings .",
    "contours will tend to bend around such pixels , until a certain column density threshold is reached and the contours snap onto the other side of the pixel .",
    "this phenomenon may be recognized in that all the irregularities will have roughly the same width in the derived profile , corresponding roughly to the width of each pixel in the map as evident in figure [ cfig3]d .",
    "figures [ cfig4]a - b show a more difficult case in which the noise is @xmath117 of the peak signal .",
    "the object in the map can be difficult to discern under such conditions .",
    "the systematic noise will prevent the construction of the innermost contours , but may also prevent the formation of contours in other regions leading to gaps in the derived profile such as in figure [ cfig4]b .",
    "it is important to note that the gaps did not prevent the derivation of the correct profile in the regions where contours could be formed .",
    "changes in contour shape introduce a bias to the resulting profiles , as seen in figure [ cfig4]c - d .",
    "no reliable method for removing such bias is apparent .",
    "however , the bias seems to be localized to only those regions of the derived profile immediately interior to the @xmath50 discontinuity . as a result ,",
    "the innermost portion of the derived density profile in figure [ cfig4]d agrees well with the original profile .",
    "how these @xmath50 discontinuities manifest themselves is best illustrated with real data as seen in the following section .",
    "star formation theory abounds with open questions , many of which are related to the process by which dense cores within molecular clouds collapse .",
    "of particular interest is the balance between forces which induce collapse , such as gravity and external pressure , and support mechanisms such as thermal pressure , turbulence , angular momentum , magnetic fields , etc .",
    "a cloud core s density distribution is central to understanding this balance . thus measuring both",
    "the gas and dust components to obtain the distribution of the total proton density is of critical importance , representing a long - standing and active field of study .",
    "the basic model of an equilibrium mass distribution @xcite assumes an isothermal sphere bounded by some external pressure .",
    "even such a simple model yields powerful insights , such as that radial volume density profiles in molecular cloud cores should resemble power laws with an approximate @xmath118 relationship between radius and volume density at the edge of the core , with a weaker dependence on radius towards the center of the core .",
    "several recent studies have utilized bonnor - ebert spheres , or some derivative thereof , such as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . as mentioned above , some studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have fitted a power law to the radial density profile . while often satisfactory , there is considerable variation in the value of the exponent among different cloud cores , with @xmath119 found in these studies",
    ".    precise measurements of the exponents in cloud cores speak to the significance of the support mechanisms .",
    "studies employing a variety of techniques have convincingly demonstrated that clouds in different evolutionary states exhibit different density distributions .",
    "@xcite made a strong case for the urgent need of investigations of density distributions and support mechanisms in pre - stellar cores in light of new data from planck .",
    "we have chosen to demonstrate our technique using total proton counts in molecular clouds due to their well - known power - law nature which may be used to validate the technique . by not assuming a geometry , we remove a significant source of bias present in previous observations .",
    "the relatively small sample size here is used for demonstration purposes , while a more focused study will be presented in forthcoming publications .",
    "it is assumed under most circumstances that gas and dust are fairly well mixed in the diffuse ism and in molecular clouds .",
    "some molecular species , such as @xmath120 or @xmath121co are generally good tracers of the total proton count in molecular clouds . however , @xmath120 can not be directly measured in clouds unless through absorption against a background source .",
    "@xmath121co requires us to determine its excitation temperature to obtain column densities .",
    "further , carbon monoxide has been shown to freeze onto dust grains at higher densities @xcite .",
    "while not without its limitations , dust provides a well - tested , proven alternative . estimating total proton column densities through stellar reddening avoids the need to determine temperatures and may be used ubiquitously throughout a cloud assuming sufficient background stars are visible .",
    "@xcite compared dust extinction , near - infrared emission , and @xmath121co emission as probes of the total proton content of dense clouds . after a detailed examination they concluded that dust extinction provided the simplest and most reliable probe .",

    "the data for two of the sources , which might actually be described as either dense clouds or cloud cores , ( b133 , and l466 ) were derived by the authors from the raw 2mass stellar reddening catalog using an implementation of the nicer method @xcite . maps for the other clouds ( l1765 , l1709 , b5 , ngc1333 ) were obtained from the perseus and ophiuchus final extinction maps as part of the complete survey that also utilize the nicer method @xcite .",

    "with l1765 , these innermost contours are displayed as an example ; they are removed from consideration in the other clouds .",
    "the map shows green contours centered around the main cloud , as well as separate contours along the secondary clump .",

    "figure [ cfig5]d indeed shows that the green region s volume density profile function follows a power law with slope @xmath125 .",
    "we are thus able to determine the form of the volume density profile in the intermediate region of the cloud ( the green group ) , where the contours are well - defined , self - similar , and include only one core or clump .",

    "the red measurements are interior to the green ones , and thus have no effect at all on the green measurements . equation [ cd ]",
    "reveals that the depth of each shell is roughly constant in the region interior to the shell , and thus so is its contribution to all interior shells in the derived profile .",
    "the primary contribution of the blue measurements is to add an approximately constant volume density to the interior green and red measurements during the derivation process .",
    "however , that constant contribution is irrelevant unless we know the specific geometry of the cloud .",
    "only the changes in the shell depth near the edge of each shell can alter the form of the derived interior profile .",
    "therefore , only the few inner - most points in the derived profile interior to the @xmath50 discontinuity are affected .",
    "our derived profile yields values for @xmath123 and @xmath99 that are scaled by unknown geometry - dependent constants .",
    "based on figure [ cfig5]d , we can not say that at a radius of @xmath126 pc , the volume density within l1765 is equal to @xmath127 , nor is that the goal of this research .",
    "we can however say with significant confidence that in those regions of the main cloud encompassed by the green contours in fig [ cfig5]a , or approximately the middle third of the cloud radially , the volume density profile is governed by a power law with exponent @xmath125 .",
    "if , and only if , the cloud is assumed to be approximately spherical , @xmath123 and @xmath99 may actually represent similar values to the real @xmath24 and @xmath128 . without geometry information however , we can only be certain of the profile s form within the trusted region .",
    "the fact that we observed a strict power - law within a molecular cloud is in line with previous observations made through other methods .",
    "it is both encouraging and disconcerting that the derived profile follows a power law quite so well .",
    "it is encouraging to see that a real map , with real data , will produce an orderly volume density profile function ( in the green region ) and that a power - law is observed as it has been by with previous studies .",

    "section [ cderivation ] presents an analytic derivation from basic principles , while section [ cnumeric ] bolsters the derivation through tests using simulated data .",
    "all the clouds studied here exhibited similar behavior with power laws present in each .",
    "all clouds exhibited power - laws with similar slopes ranging from @xmath142 to @xmath143 in their middle regions .",
    "we believe that these power - laws are not artifacts of our method since analytic derivation , and numeric simulations show that the technique should be capable of properly deriving any kind of radial profile function .",
    "we chose to demonstrate the technique using 2mass data on molecular cloud cores .",
    "the total proton density is of particular interest as it contains information on support mechanisms as well the formation rates of molecules such as h@xmath144 , or @xmath121co . while we did not display the data for all clouds studied in this paper",
    ", it seems that quite often there are regions where the cloud s column density contours exhibit remarkable self - similarity accompanied by sharp changes in contour shape ( @xmath50 discontinuities ) between regions .",
    "our method shows that there does not appear to be a gradual change in the derived local power laws , but rather sudden shifts where the interior profile may follow a power law of @xmath145 , followed by an @xmath50 discontinuity , and a much steeper power law of @xmath146 in the exterior regions . that this sudden break accompanies a stark shift in contour shapes is intriguing . with only two isolated clouds",
    ", there is insufficient data with which to draw general conclusions , and that is beyond the scope of demonstration of the technique .",
    "if it can be proven that this is a common characteristic of isolated molecular cloud cores and is not some kind of artifact of the column density maps or the technique for deriving radial profiles , then is there a real effect which produces a sudden change in the density behavior of these clouds .",
    "one possibility may be that the properties of the dust particles change at lower densities , thus producing a sharper drop in observed extinction , or one of the cloud s support mechanisms ceases to be effective at a certain point leading to a steeper drop in density in the exterior .",
    "it may also be possible that the interior of the cloud is undergoing gravitational collapse while the exterior is not .",
    "we can say at the present time that we have no reason to believe that this change in local power laws is due to biases within the data or our reduction technique within the bounds of the limitations discussed throughout the paper as we have tested the technique using a variety of geometries , profile forms , beam widths , and reduction techniques .",
    "there is nothing in the analytical derivation suggesting that such a phenomenon should be produced as a side - effect .",
    "furthermore , while previous studies have found that the localized power law seems to change within different regions of individual cloud cores , these studies may not have been able to discern how sharp the change is due to their use of geometric assumptions which obscure the manifestation of @xmath50 discontinuities .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",

    "this research was carried out in part at the jet propulsion laboratory operated for nasa by the california institute of technology .",
    "we thank the hayden planetarium , and rebecca oppenheimer in particular for generously providing a conducive environment in which a portion of this research was carried out .",

    "<S> we present a geometry - independent method for determining the shapes of radial volume density profiles of astronomical objects whose geometries are unknown , based on a single column density map </S>",
    "<S> . such profiles are often critical to understand the physics and chemistry of molecular cloud cores , in which star formation takes place . </S>",
    "<S> the method presented here does not assume any geometry for the object being studied , thus removing a significant source of bias . </S>",
    "<S> instead it exploits contour self - similarity in column density maps which appears to be common in data for astronomical objects . </S>",
    "<S> our method may be applied to many types of astronomical objects and observable quantities so long as they satisfy a limited set of conditions which we describe in detail . </S>",

    "<S> while not having made an extensive comparison of different density profiles , we find that the overall radial density distribution within molecular cloud cores is adequately described by an attenuated power law . </S>"
