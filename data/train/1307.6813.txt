    "the surprising and unexpected predictions from quantum mechanics have been challenging our classical intuition for a century .",
    "since then , efforts in both theoretical and experimental fields have increasingly aimed at a better understanding of quantum systems . in particular , experiments with cold atomic gases",
    "@xcite are an interesting way of building and probing quantum systems : properties of atomic condensates near absolute zero temperature are governed by pure quantum effects .",
    "an interesting example of an unexpected quantum mechanical prediction that was experimentally confirmed in cold atomic gases is the so - called efimov effect , which predicts that three identical bosons interacting through short range potentials present infinitely many bound states , where the energies between states are geometrically spaced .",
    "this effect was predicted by efimov in 1970 @xcite and was experimentally verified in cold atomic gases experiments in 2006 @xcite .",
    "the efimov effect happens for three dimensional ( 3d ) systems , while the quantum theory predicts that the same two dimensional ( 2d ) system presents only two bound states and no efimov effect @xcite .",
    "the theoretical difference arising from changing system dimension could most likely also be verified in cold atomic gases experiments in the near future since experimentalists are already able to change dimensionality of such systems and build experiments in effectively one ( 1d ) or two ( 2d ) spatial dimensions .",
    "another important theoretical prediction , that was recently reported in @xcite , is the emergence of a parameter in the study of two - component fermi gases , the two - body contact parameter , @xmath0 , which connects universal relations between two - body correlations and many - body properties @xcite .",
    "this parameter can most easily be defined by considering the single - particle momentum distribution of the system , @xmath1 . in the limit where @xmath2",
    ", one finds @xmath3 as mentioned above , this parameter appears in a number of universal relations for both few- and many - body properties .",
    "these relations also hold for bosons and were confirmed in cold atomic gases experiments for two - component fermi gases @xcite and for bosons @xcite .",
    "one way to determine this parameter is to find the coefficient in the leading order asymptotic behavior of the one - body momentum density of few - body systems .",
    "the next order in this expansion defines the three - body contact parameter , @xmath4 , but since the pauli principle suppresses the short - range correlations for two - component fermi gases , the three - body parameter is only important for bosons @xcite . in a gas of identical bosons in 3d",
    "the efimov effect occurs and one finds a momentum distribution of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the efimov parameter @xcite and @xmath7 is constant @xcite .",
    "the two- and three- body contact parameters were studied for a 3d system of three identical bosons in @xcite and for mixed - species systems in @xcite .",
    "these results show that the influence of non - equal masses in three - body systems goes beyond changing the contact parameters values . in 3d the sub - leading term , which defines @xmath4 , changes to a different functional form when the masses are not equal . in view of that",
    ", one may ask what changes could we get when dealing with mixed species systems in 2d .",
    "it is known that mixed - species systems have a richer energy spectrum in 2d comparing with symmetric mass systems @xcite .",
    "the study of the momentum distribution for three identical bosons in 2d was reported in @xcite where the two - body contact parameter is found to be a universal constant , in the sense that @xmath8 is the same for both three - body bound states of energy @xmath9 .",
    "the leading order term of the momentum distribution at large momenta has the same inverse quartic form in 1d @xcite , 2d , and 3d .",
    "this can be derived on general grounds and is intuitively connected to the behavior of the free propagator for the particles @xcite .",
    "however , the three - body contact parameter and the functional form of the sub - leading term were showed to present a very different behavior in 2d as compared to 3d @xcite although no analytical results have been presented to estimate the value of the contact parameter .",
    "in this paper we study cylindrically symmetric three - body bound states of 2d systems composed of three distinguishable particles with attractive short - range interactions .",
    "we derive analytic expressions for @xmath0 and @xmath4 and numerically obtain the one - body momentum density to verify our results . unlike 3d systems , the sub - leading order in the asymptotic momentum density presents the same functional form for both equal masses and mixed - species systems .",
    "we find that @xmath0 no longer shows universal behavior in the general case but do show that the universality is recovered in at least one special case of two identical non - interacting particles .",
    "we also extend our asymptotic formulas to the full range of momenta and use it to give an analytic expression for @xmath0 for the ground state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the formalism and the quantities that appear in the work are properly shown and defined in sec .",
    "[ formal ] .",
    "the analytic formulas to the asymptotic spectator function are discussed in sec .",
    "[ spec ] and the one - body large momentum behaviors are derived in sec .  [ momentum ] .",

    "we consider the two dimensional ( 2d ) problem of three interacting particles of masses @xmath10 which are pairwise bound with energies @xmath11 . the interaction is assumed to be described as attractive zero - range potentials and the resulting @xmath12wave three - body bound state of energy @xmath13 is fully determined by these six parameters : three two - body energies and three masses .",
    "we shall only investigate bound states and we therefore let @xmath14 denote the absolute value of the binding energy .",
    "we use the faddeev decomposition to write the momentum space wave function as @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the jacobi momenta of particle @xmath17 , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the reduced masses .",

    "then all momenta ( @xmath30 ) should be multiplied by @xmath31 .",
    "this means we can choose both a unit of energy , say @xmath32 , and a unit of mass , say @xmath33 , while using the momenta in the unit of @xmath34 .",
    "in other words , after all calculations are done with @xmath35 and @xmath36 , we have to multiply all energies by @xmath32 , all masses by @xmath33 , and all momenta by @xmath34 .",
    "the one - body momentum density of particle @xmath17 is defined by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is given in ( [ eq.01 ] ) .",
    "we use the normalization where @xmath39 . following the procedure in @xcite , we group the nine terms in @xmath40 into four components with distinctly different integrand structure .",
    "the one - body momentum density is expressed as a sum of four terms , that is @xmath41 .",
    "a general system of three distinguishable particles , presents three distinct one - body momentum density distributions corresponding to the different particles .",

    "we emphasize that the distributions for the other particles can be obtained by cyclic permutations of @xmath20 in these expressions .",
    "the spectator functions are the key ingredients",
    ". they can be characterized by their behavior in small and large momentum limits .",
    "we are first of all interested in large momenta , but we shall as well extract the behavior for small momenta . hopefully these pieces can be put together in a coherent structure .      for three identical bosons",

    ", we have three different spectator functions .",
    "however , their large - momentum asymptotic behavior all remain identical , when all three two - body subsystems are bound , except for individual proportionality factors . to prove this we carry out the angular integrals in ( [ eq.02 ] ) , which immediately gives @xmath52 .",

    "can be inserted in the second term , @xmath67 , on the left - hand - side of ( [ eq.a03 ] ) , because we are in the asymptotic limit where @xmath68 .",
    "for @xmath2 we then get @xmath69 where we changed integration variable , @xmath70 , in the last expression . carrying out the two integrals we get @xmath71 @xmath72 where we used that the integrals in the right - hand - side of ( [ eq.a07 ] ) and ( [ eq.a08 ] ) are finite and their contributions",
    "can be neglected when @xmath73 in comparison with the terms maintained .    in total , the spectator functions in ( [ eq.a01 ] ) are now found by inserting ( [ eq.a07 ] ) and ( [ eq.a08 ] ) in ( [ eq.a06 ] ) .",
    "notice that the contribution from ( [ eq.a08 ] ) has to be multiplied by @xmath74 . with the @xmath75 interchange we also get the second term in the right - hand - side of ( [ eq.a01 ] ) .",
    "the leading order large - momentum behavior of the spectator functions are therefore @xmath76 replacing @xmath77 in ( [ eq.a09 ] ) by its conjectured asymptotic form , ( [ eq.a00 ] ) , we find a system of three linear equations for the three unknown , @xmath78 , which can be rewritten as @xmath79 .",
    "the leading order large - momentum asymptotic behavior for the three spectator functions are then @xmath80 this result relates the asymptotic behavior of the three spectator functions for one state .",
    "the remaining constant @xmath81 still depends on which excited state we consider , and furthermore also on two - body masses and two - body energies .    the derived large - momentum asymptotic behavior and the coefficients in ( [ eq.a10 ] ) beautifully agree with the numerical calculation . in figure [ fig.a01 ]",
    "we plot the difference @xmath82 as a function of the momentum @xmath55 for the two different spectator functions for the @xmath83cs-@xmath83cs-@xmath84li system .",
    "we also show the same difference for a different system with three identical bosons .",

    "this comparison is again consistent with the derived asymptotic behavior , and furthermore exhibit the rate and accuracy of the convergence .",
    "the limit is reached within 10% and 1% already for @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively .     as a function of the momentum @xmath55 .",

    "the asymptotic spectator function in ( [ eq.a10 ] ) seems to be a good approximation even for moderate values of @xmath55 , e.g. @xmath90 .",
    "we also have information about the large - distance behavior for a given binding energy , that is @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is related to the binding energy and @xmath93 is the hyperradius .",
    "fourier transformation then relates to the small momentum limit with an overall behavior of @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is a constant related to the energy .",
    "this perfectly matches ( [ eq.01 ] ) when two jacobi momenta are present as in the three - body system .",
    "we therefore attempt a parametrization combining the expected small momenta with the known large - momentum behavior : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a normalization constant which satisfies @xmath98 .",
    "we should first emphasize that excited states with the same angular structure must have a different number of radial nodes .",
    "therefore we concentrate here only on the ground state .",
    "the expression in ( [ eq.a11 ] ) for the three ground state spectator functions parametrizes the small momentum behavior almost perfectly for the case of three distinguishable particles .",
    "this is seen in fig.[fig.a03 ] where we compare numerical and parametrized solution .",
    "however , when small momenta are reproduced the large - momentum limit deviates in overall normalization , although with the same @xmath55-dependence .",
    "surprisingly , the analytic expression is most successful for the spectator function related to the heaviest particle in the three - body system .",
    "this large - momentum mismatch is due to the normalization choice in ( [ eq.a11 ] ) , which is chosen to exactly reproduce the @xmath99 limit .    ) and the numeric solution of ( [ eq.02 ] ) , for a @xmath83cs-@xmath83cs-@xmath84li system . ]",
    "the one - body density functions are observable quantities .",
    "the most directly measurable part is the limit of large momenta .",
    "we therefore separately consider the large - momentum limit of the four terms in ( [ eq.03a ] ) to ( [ eq.03d ] ) .",
    "we employ the method sketched in @xcite and used to present numerical results for three identical bosons in 2d . here",
    "we shall give more details and generalize to systems of three distinguishable particles .    in three dimensions ( 3d ) , the corresponding problem was solved by inserting the asymptotic spectator function ( [ eq.a10 ] ) into each of the four terms in ( [ eq.03a ] ) to ( [ eq.03d ] ) , and evaluating the corresponding integrals @xcite .",
    "this procedure is not guaranteed to work in @xmath86 because momenta smaller than the asymptotic values may contribute in the integrands . however , for @xmath100 it was shown that leading order in the integrands is sufficient to provide both leading and next - to - leading order of the one - body momentum distributions .",
    "the details of these calculation in @xmath100 can be found in @xcite for three identical bosons and in @xcite for mass - imbalanced systems .",
    "the large - momentum spectator functions change a lot as dimensionality is changed , going from @xmath101 in 3d to @xmath50 in 2d .",
    "if we try to naively proceed in 2d as successfully done in @xmath100 , the integrals diverge .",
    "we can circumvent this divergence problem by following the procedure used in the derivation of the asymptotic spectator functions . in the following , we work out each of the four momentum components defined in ( [ eq.03a ] ) to ( [ eq.03d ] ) .",
    "in addition we must simultaneously consider the next - to - leading order term arising from the dominant @xmath102-term .",
    "@xmath103 : this term is straightforward to calculate .",
    "the argument of the spectator function in ( [ eq.03a ] ) does not depend on the integration variable .",
    "the large - momentum limit is then found by replacing the spectator function by its asymptotic form and taking the large @xmath55 limit after a simple integration .",
    "we get then @xmath104    @xmath105 : we integrate the two terms in ( [ eq.03b ] ) over the angle as allowed by the simple structure where the spectator function is angle independent .",

    "cyclic permutations of the indices in ( [ eq.07 ] ) and ( [ eq.07a ] ) now allow the conclusion that the three different three - body contact parameters are related by the mass factors in ( [ eq.07 ] ) and ( [ eq.07a ] ) .",

    "mass - imbalanced systems have a richer energy spectrum with many excited states @xcite . maintaining the universal conditions for all excited states is obviously more demanding .",

    "this is implied by @xmath185 as seen from the set of coupled homogeneous integrals equations ( [ eq.02 ] ) .",

    "the momentum density tail gives the two- and three - body contact parameters , namely @xmath0 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "we derived analytic expressions for the asymptotic spectator functions and for both @xmath0 and @xmath4 for three distinguishable bosons .",
    "we found that the asymptotic spectator function for each of the three distinguishable particles has the same functional form as calculated for three identical particles in @xcite .",
    "moreover , we showed that the three distinct spectator functions relate to each other through a constant , @xmath81 , properly weighted by reduced masses .",
    "these analytic results are supported by accurate numerical calculation , which confirmed both the asymptotic behavior and the relation between the asymptotic expressions for different spectator functions in a generic case of three distinguishable particles .    the spectator functions and their asymptotic behavior define both two- and three - body contact parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "the parameters @xmath0 arise from integration of the spectator functions over all momenta , and both small and large momenta contribute . in the case of the ground state , we are able to use our knowledge of the asymptotics of the spectator function to infer the behavior for all momenta .",
    "we found that the three two - body parameters for a system of three distinguishable particles are related by simple mass scaling .",
    "however , these two - body contact parameters are in general not universal in the sense of being independent of the state when more than one excited state is present .",
    "in contrast , we find universality for three - body systems with one distinguishable and two identical , non - interacting particles . in that case",
    "the third particle apparently does not disturb the short - distance structure arising from the two interacting particles .",
    "hence , the two - body contact parameter turn out to be universal .",
    "this is similar to the 3d case and three identical bosons where @xmath0 is universal in the scaling or efimov limit where the binding energy is negligible @xcite .    in 3d systems ,",
    "the two - body contact has been observed in experiments using time - of - flight and mapping to momentum space @xcite , bragg spectroscopy @xcite , or momentum - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( similar to angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ) @xcite .",
    "measuring the sub - leading term and thus accessing @xmath4 requires more precision which has so far only produced upper limits for the particular case of @xmath228rb @xcite . in 2d systems",
    "the functional form of the sub - leading term is different from the 3d case so it is difficult to compare the cases .",
    "however , given that the precision improves continuously it should be possible to also probe the 2d case when tightly squeezing a 3d sample . as we have shown here",
    ", the mass ratio can change the values of the contact parameters significantly .",
    "we thus expect that mixtures of different atoms is the most promising direction to make a measurement of a 2d contact parameter .",
    "we have analyzed in details two different systems of the heavy - heavy - light type that is relevant for current experiments with cold gas mixtures . in both cases",
    "the light particle is @xmath84li while the two heavy particles are either both @xmath83cs or both @xmath229k .",
    "we find that , unlike the equal mass scenario , the two - body contact parameters are not universal constants when all subsystems are interacting . here",
    "universal means that @xmath0 divided by the three - body binding energy is independent of which excited state is considered .",
    "however , if the two identical particles are not interacting , the heavy - heavy and the heavy - light two - body contact parameters become universal and are related to each other by a factor of two .",
    "the methods presented here are in principle also applicable to 1d setups and it would be interesting to investigate the question of universality of the contact parameters for three - body states there as well . in some respects",
    "1d is easier to handle since zero - range interactions do not require regularization and one can in fact map the 3d scattering length to a 1d equivalent @xcite which provides access to confinement - induced resonances that allow the study of the infinite 1d coupling strength limit .",
    "this was recently demonstrated for trapped few - fermion systems in 1d @xcite . in that case",
    "the two - body contact can be determined fully analytically using the methods described in @xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting to consider the bosonic case where three - body bound states are possible with or without an in - line trap . in the case of quasi-1d setups where the transverse trapping energy is a relevant scale compared to the binding energies",
    ", one needs to also take into account the transverse ( typically harmonic ) degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "our formalism can be adapted to this case as well .",
    "another interesting pursuit would be to long - range interactions using either heteronuclear molecules or atoms with large magnetic dipole moments @xcite , where the momentum distribution has in fact already been probed in experiments @xcite .",
    "bound state formation has been predicted in both single- @xcite , bi- @xcite , and multi - layer systems @xcite , as well as in one or several quasi-1d tubes @xcite",
    ". the current formalism should be adaptable to dipolar particles and the contact parameters could subsequently be studied . in particular , in the limit of small binding energy one may in some cases use effective short - range interaction terms to mimic dipolar interactions @xcite which makes the implementation through the faddeev equations considerably simpler .",
    "this is of course also the limit in which the contact parameters are most interesting .",
