    "a major goal of nuclear physics is to understand the stability , structure , and reactions of nuclei as a consequence of the interactions between individual nucleons .",
    "this is an extremely challenging many - body problem , exacerbated by the fact that we do not know in detail what the interactions are .",
    "quantum chromodynamics , the fundamental theory for strong interactions , is so difficult to solve in the nonperturbative regime of low - energy nuclear physics that no one is currently able to quantitatively describe the interactions between two nucleons from first principles .",
    "however , we do have a tremendous amount of experimental data on nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath2 ) scattering and we can construct accurate representations of @xmath2 interactions by means of two - body potentials .",
    "these potentials are complicated , depending on the relative positions , spins , isospins , and momenta of the nucleons , which makes the problem of finding accurate quantum - mechanical solutions of many - nucleon bound and scattering states a demanding task .",
    "nevertheless , a variety of precise calculations have been carried out for the three- and four - nucleon systems which reveal an additional complication : two - nucleon forces alone are inadequate to quantitatively explain either the bound - state properties or a variety of @xmath3 and @xmath4 scattering data .",
    "this is not surprising , because meson - exchange theory and the composite nature of nucleons indicate that many - nucleon forces , at least three - nucleon forces , are important .",
    "however , these are even more difficult to construct from first principles . in like manner ,",
    "meson - exchange introduces two - body charge and current operators , and calculations of electroweak transitions show that these are also necessary to achieve agreement with data .    despite these difficulties , tremendous progress has been made in the past decade , both in the characterization of nuclear forces and currents , and in the development of accurate many - body techniques for evaluating them .",
    "a multienergy partial - wave analyses of elastic @xmath2 scattering data below @xmath5 mev was produced by the nijmegen group in 1993  @xcite , which demonstrated that over 4300 data points could be fit with a @xmath6 per datum @xmath7 1 .",
    "this was achieved by careful attention to the known long - range part of the @xmath2 interaction and a rigorous winnowing of inconsistent data .",
    "their work inspired the construction of a number of new @xmath2 potential models which gave comparably good fits to the database .",
    "concurrently , several essentially exact methods have been developed for the study of few - nucleon ( @xmath8 = 3,4 ) systems with such realistic @xmath2 potentials .",
    "the first accurate , converged calculations of three - nucleon ( @xmath9 ) bound states were obtained by configuration - space faddeev methods in 1985  @xcite , while the first accurate @xmath10he bound states were obtained by the green s function monte carlo method in 1987  @xcite .",
    "other methods of comparable accuracy have been developed since then for both @xmath8 = 3,4 bound states and for @xmath9 scattering .",
    "a comprehensive review of many aspects of the few - nucleon problem can be found in the article by carlson and schiavilla  @xcite .",
    "the result of all the progress in the last decade is that we have obtained an excellent understanding of few - nucleon systems , including both structure and reactions , although a few unanswered problems remain .    until recently , nuclei larger than @xmath11 have been described within the framework of the nuclear shell model or mean - field pictures such as skyrme models . the classic description of p - shell ( @xmath12 ) nuclei was developed by cohen and kurath in the 1960s  @xcite .",
    "in that work , a large number of experimental levels were fit in terms of a relatively small number of two - body matrix elements , but no direct connection was made to the underlying @xmath2 force . beginning with the work of kuo and brown  @xcite , approximate methods for relating the shell - model matrix elements to the underlying forces were developed and applied to even larger nuclei .",
    "however , in most calculations , only the valence nucleons , i.e. , the nucleons in the last unfilled shell , are treated as active , while the core is inert .",
    "recently the first `` no - core '' shell model calculations , in which all the nucleons are active , have been made in the p - shell with effective interactions that have been derived by a g - matrix procedure from a realistic underlying @xmath2 force  @xcite .",
    "these calculations agree with the other exact methods for the @xmath13 nuclei , but fully - converged calculations for larger systems have not yet been obtained .",
    "the present article focuses on recent developments in quantum monte carlo methods that are making the light p - shell nuclei accessible at a level of accuracy close to that obtained for the s - shell ( @xmath14 ) nuclei .",
    "the quantum monte carlo methods include variational monte carlo ( vmc ) and green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) methods .",
    "the vmc is an approximate method  @xcite that is used as a starting point for the more accurate gfmc calculations .",
    "because of its relative simplicity , the vmc has also been used to make first studies of various reactions , such as the nuclear response to electron @xcite or pion scattering  @xcite , and for electroweak capture reactions of astrophysical interest  @xcite .",
    "the gfmc is exact in the sense that binding energies can be calculated with an accuracy of better than 2% ; it has been used to compute ground states and low - lying excitations of all the @xmath1 nuclei  @xcite .",
    "these studies of light p - shell nuclei have shown that nuclear structure can be predicted from the elementary nuclear forces .",
    "as presently implemented , both the vmc and gfmc methods require significant additional computer resources for every nucleon added , so they probably will be limited to systems of @xmath15 nuclei . a new method",
    ", whose accuracy lies between that of the vmc and gfmc methods , is auxiliary - field diffusion monte carlo ( afdmc ) ; it has been implemented for large pure neutron systems  @xcite and with further development should be capable of handling nuclei above @xmath16 .",
    "most of the calculations discussed here have been made using hamiltonians containing the argonne @xmath17 @xmath2 potential  @xcite alone or with one of the urbana  @xcite or illinois  @xcite series of @xmath9 potentials .",
    "argonne @xmath17 ( av18 ) is representative of the modern @xmath2 potentials that give accurate fits to scattering data , while the urbana and illinois models are modern @xmath9 potentials based on meson - exchange interactions and fit to the binding energies of light nuclei .",
    "these models are described in some detail in section 2 to show the complexity of modern nuclear forces , and the consequent challenge for many - body theory .",
    "the vmc method is presented in section 3 ; it starts with the construction of a variational wave function of specified angular momentum , parity and isospin , @xmath18 , using products of two- and three - body correlation operators acting on a fully antisymmetrized set of one - body basis states coupled to specific quantum numbers .",
    "metropolis monte carlo integration  @xcite is used to evaluate @xmath19 , giving an upper bound to the energy of the state .",
    "the gfmc method , described in section 4 , is a stochastic method that systematically improves on @xmath20 by projecting out excited state contamination using the euclidean propagation @xmath21 \\psi_v$ ] . in the limit @xmath22",
    ", this leads to the exact @xmath23 .",
    "energy results for the ground states and many low - lying excited states of the @xmath24 nuclei are presented in section 5 . with the new hamiltonians ,",
    "the excitation spectra are reproduced very well , including the relative stability of different nuclei and the splittings between excited states .",
    "energy differences between isobaric analog states and isospin - mixing matrix elements have also been computed to study the charge - independence - breaking of the strong and electromagnetic forces .",
    "a variety of density and momentum distributions , electromagnetic moments and form factors , transition densities , spectroscopic factors , and intrinsic deformation are presented in section 6 .",
    "one of the chief benefits of this approach is that absolute normalizations can be computed , and effective charges so commonly needed in traditional shell - model calculations of electroweak transitions are not required .",
    "while the quantum monte carlo methods have been used primarily for stationary states , it is also possible to study scattering states , as discussed in section 7 . some first calculations of astrophysical radiative capture reactions in the p - shell are presented in section 8 .",
    "both of these applications are in their early stages , but promise to be major fields of endeavor for future work . in section 9",
    "we discuss neutron drops , systems of interacting neutrons confined in an artificial external well , that can serve as reference points for the development of skyrme interactions for use in very large neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "finally , in section 10 , we consider the outlook for future developments .",
    "the hamiltonian used in this review use includes nonrelativistic kinetic energy , the av18 @xmath2 potential  @xcite and either the urbana ix  @xcite or one of the new illinois series of @xmath25 potential  @xcite : @xmath26 the kinetic energy operator has charge - independent ( ci ) and charge - symmetry - breaking ( csb ) components , the latter due to the difference between proton and neutron masses , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the isospin of nucleon @xmath29 .    the av18 potential is written as a sum of electromagnetic and one - pion - exchange terms and a shorter - range phenomenological part , @xmath30 the electromagnetic terms include one- and two - photon - exchange coulomb interaction , vacuum polarization , darwin - foldy , and magnetic moment terms , all with appropriate proton and neutron form factors .",
    "the one - pion - exchange part of the potential includes the charge - dependent ( cd ) terms due to the difference in neutral and charged pion masses .",

    "the coupling constant in eq.([eq : vpi ] ) is @xmath42 and the scaling mass @xmath43 .",
    "the remaining terms are of intermediate ( two - pion - exchange ) and short range , with some 40 adjustable parameters . the one - pion - exchange and the remaining phenomenological part of the potential",

    "the potential was fit directly to the nijmegen @xmath2 scattering data base  @xcite containing 1787 @xmath47 and 2514 @xmath48 data in the range 0350 mev , to the @xmath49 scattering length , and to the deuteron binding energy , with a @xmath6 per datum of 1.09 .",
    "while the cd and csb terms are small , there is a clear need for their presence .",
    "the nijmegen group studied many @xmath2 potentials from the 1980s and before , and found that potentials fit to @xmath48 data in @xmath50 states did not fit @xmath47 data well even after allowing for standard coulomb effects , and vice versa  @xcite .",
    "all five modern @xmath2 potentials , reid93 , nijm i and ii  @xcite , cd bonn  @xcite , and av18 , which fit @xmath47 and @xmath48 scattering data with a @xmath51point near 1 , have cd components .",
    "the csb term is required to fit the difference between the @xmath47 and @xmath49 scattering lengths , and is consistent with the mass difference between @xmath52h and @xmath52he , as shown below .",
    "the identification of the proper ci , cd , and csb @xmath2 force components is important in setting the proper baseline for the introduction of @xmath9 forces , which are required to fit the @xmath52h and @xmath52he binding energies as a primary constraint .",
    "the urbana series of three - nucleon potentials is written as a sum of two - pion - exchange p - wave and remaining shorter - range phenomenological terms , @xmath53 the structure of the two - pion p - wave exchange term with an intermediate @xmath54 excitation ( fig .",

    "@xmath60 , as in the original fujita - miyazawa model  @xcite , while other potentials like the tucson - melbourne  @xcite and brazil  @xcite models , have a ratio slightly larger than @xmath61 .",
    "the shorter - range phenomenological term is given by @xmath62 for the urbana ix ( uix ) model , the parameters were determined by fitting the binding energy of @xmath52h and the density of nuclear matter in conjunction with av18 .    as shown below , while the combined av18/uix hamiltonian reproduces the binding energies of s - shell nuclei , it does not do so well for light p - shell nuclei . recently a new class of @xmath9 potentials , called the illinois models , has been developed to address this problem  @xcite .",
    "these potentials contain the urbana terms and two additional terms , resulting in a total of four coupling constants that can be adjusted to fit the data .",
    "one term , @xmath63 , is due to @xmath64 s - wave scattering as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : vijk]b",

    "the illinois models use the form recommended in the latest texas model  @xcite , where chiral symmetry is used to constrain the structure of the interaction .",
    "however , in practice , this term is much smaller than the @xmath65 contribution and behaves similarly in light nuclei , so it is difficult to establish its strength independently just from calculations of energy levels .",
    "a more important addition is a simplified form for three - pion rings containing one or two deltas ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vijk]c , d ) . as discussed in ref .",

    "the @xmath71 is a projector onto isospin-@xmath72 triples : @xmath73 to the extent isospin is conserved , there are no such triples in the s - shell nuclei , and so this term does not affect them .",

    "however , the @xmath74 term is attractive in all the p - shell nuclei studied .",
    "the @xmath75 has the same structure as the isospin part of anticommutator part of @xmath76 , but the @xmath77 term is repulsive in all nuclei studied so far . in p - shell nuclei , the magnitude of the @xmath77 term is smaller than that of the @xmath74 term , so the net effect of the @xmath78 is slight repulsion in s - shell nuclei and larger attraction in p - shell nuclei .",

    "this arises from the stochastic evaluation of the matrix elements in eq.([eq : expectation ] ) .",
    "the @xmath311 is a local operator and can mix in the boson solution .",
    "this has a ( much ) lower energy than the fermion solution and thus is exponentially amplified in subsequent propagations . in the final integration with the antisymmetric @xmath129 , the desired fermionic part is projected out , but in the presence of large statistical errors that grow exponentially with @xmath70 . because the number of pairs that can be exchanged grows with @xmath8 , the sign problem also grows exponentially with increasing @xmath8 . for @xmath312 ,",
    "the errors grow so fast that convergence in @xmath70 can not be achieved .    for simple scalar wave functions",

    "such `` fixed - node '' gfmc provides an approximate solution which is the best possible variational wave function with the same nodal structure as @xmath129 .",

    "a suitable `` constrained path '' approximation has been developed and extensively tested , first for condensed matter systems  @xcite and more recently for nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the constrained - path method is to discard those configurations that , in future generations , will contribute only noise to expectation values .",

    "@xmath315 designates the complete path , @xmath316 that has led to @xmath317 .",
    "the sum of these discarded configurations can be written as a state @xmath318 , which obviously has zero overlap with the ground state .",
    "the @xmath319 contains only excited states and should decay away as @xmath22 , thus discarding it is justified .",
    "of course the exact @xmath320 is not known , and so configurations are discarded with a probability such that the average overlap with the trial wave function , @xmath321 many tests of this procedure have been made  @xcite and it usually gives results that are consistent with unconstrained propagation , within statistical errors .",
    "however a few cases in which the constrained propagation converges to the wrong energy ( either above or below the correct energy ) have been found .",
    "therefore a small number , @xmath322 to 20 , unconstrained steps are made before evaluating expectation values .",
    "these few unconstrained steps , out of typically 400 total steps , appear to be enough to damp out errors introduced by the constraint , but do not greatly increase the statistical error .",

    "reliable estimates of the energies of broad resonances requires the use of scattering - state boundary conditions ( see sec .  [",

    "this is because the limited propagation time is not sufficient for the gfmc algorithm to filter out low - lying excitations with the same quantum numbers .",
    "this issue is unimportant in @xmath10he , where the first 0@xmath331 excited state is near 20 mev , but in @xmath140li , the first 1@xmath331 excited state is at only 5.65 mev ; other @xmath204-shell nuclei have similar low - lying excitations .",

    "this feature has to be implemented in the initial variational wave function because , as remarked before , the vmc and gfmc methods find their best wave functions by optimizing the energy , which is not sensitive to the long - range behavior .",

    "they are similar to the correlations discussed in sec .  3 , except that they revert to the identity operator at pair separations beyond about 2 fm .",
    "the correlations @xmath464 are generated from optical potentials that describe the experimental phase shifts in cluster - cluster scattering ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for details . because the @xmath463 go to unity",

    "evaluation of electromagnetic matrix elements between the initial scattering and final bound states can be split into two parts by noting that all of the energy dependence is contained in the relative wave function @xmath466 and the transition operators .",
    "thus , using a technique first applied in a vmc calculation of @xmath391+@xmath391 radiative capture  @xcite , the matrix element for a given scattering partial wave can be written as @xmath467 where @xmath468 denotes any of the standard @xmath469 or @xmath470 operators .",
    "the integration over all coordinates except @xmath471 can be calculated just once for each partial wave by monte carlo sampling , and the result can then be used to compute the full integral for as many energies as desired by recomputing @xmath472 only .",

    "this is possible with the vmc calculation because of the fully correlated @xmath8-body wave functions that are used . in this case",

    "neutron - rich nuclei are interesting both because of their importance in various astrophysical contexts , such as the r - process or neutron - star crusts , and the current interest in experiments with radioactive beams . these nuclei are often studied within the framework of mean - field models using skyrme or other potential models .",
