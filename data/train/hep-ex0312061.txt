    "proton decay modes containing a final state kaon , @xmath56 , have large branching ratios in many susy gut models . because there is a non - zero probability that an atmospheric neutrino interaction can mimic such a proton decay signature , estimating these background rates is an important component to such searches .",
    "the following lists some of the contributing strange production channels available at low energies :    @xmath57    typically , such reactions have smaller cross sections than their single pion counterparts due to the kaon mass and because the kaon channels are not enhanced by any dominant resonance ( in contrast to @xmath51 decays to single pion final states ) .",
    "there are few predictive theoretical models for single kaon production  @xcite and little experimental data .",
    "most of the data comes from bubble chamber measurements where the strange particle decays could be explicitly identified .",

    "are generally of @xmath60 precision and come primarily from experiments which ran in the 1970 s and early 1980 s  @xcite . at these energies , it is especially challenging to model the total cross section as there are substantial overlapping contributions from qe , resonance , and dis processes .",

    "reasonable agreement between the various monte carlo simulations and experimental data is observed .",
    "the agreement is slightly better for cc interactions than for nc .",
