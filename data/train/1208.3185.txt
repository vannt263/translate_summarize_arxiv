    "the evolutionary dynamics of a large population are mainly determined by the distribution of fitness in the population . in general , fitness depends on many traits , which are affected by mutations . in a rapidly changing environment , populations are far from any fitness optimum , with many mutations available that increase fitness ( and even more that decrease fitness ) .    to model such scenarios , we consider a collection of @xmath1 asexual individuals that are characterized by a log - fitness @xmath2 , which determines their average reproductive success .",

    "only after ancestral lineages have moved to the high fitness tail of the distribution , where only few individuals are , does the rate of coalescence become appreciable .",

    "in addition , @xmath48 , is non - monotonic and increases as @xmath51 .    the majority of the contributions to the increase of @xmath48 for @xmath51 stem from the very last coalescent event .",

    "this is a consequence of the even branching ratios ; an additional individual will most likely coalesce with existing samples and only rarely increases @xmath58 .",
    "in contrast , the trees generated by our model of adaptation tend to branch very unevenly and one often observes that one external branch goes all the way back to the mrca of the sample , as in fig .  [",
    "fig : influenza]b . as the sample size",
    "is increased , one continues to sample deeper into the tree .",
    "this is a generic property of the bsc @xcite , where the average @xmath59 increases as @xmath60 with the sample size @xmath56 .",
    "similarily , @xmath61 of the entire population is expected to increase as @xmath62 with the population size .",
    "our simulations are consistent with this behavior ; see fig .",
    "note that @xmath63 depends weakly on @xmath1 in adapting populations , while it increases linearly with @xmath1 in kingman s coalescent .",

    "the simulation results presented above show that genealogies arising in our model are distinct from those expected in kingman s coalescent and display a number of features reminiscent of the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent .",
    "we will now describe how this coalescent process emerges from the dynamics of the model .",
    "individuals in our model have a heritable fitness which determines the distribution of the number of immediate offspring .",
    "while fit individuals have on average more offspring than less fit ones , the fitness differences in the population are small and the offspring distribution across the population is narrow . however , fitness is heritable and fit individuals can have a very large number of distant great@xmath66-grandchildren .",
    "hence the distribution of offspring after @xmath67 generations , @xmath68 , will be dominated by fit individuals and can have a very long tail .",
    "conversely , the present day population has fewer and fewer ancestors as we trace its lineages backwards in time . at @xmath58 generations in the past",
    ", there is exactly one individual that is the ancestor to the entire population .",
    "ancestors of the mrca are also common ancestors ( ca ) of the entire population , albeit not the most recent one .",
    "[ fig : mrca ] shows that mrcas and cas tend to come from the high fitness tail of the population .",
    "mrcas tend to be fitter than cas , since they are conditioned on giving rise to at least two lineages that persist to the present .    the offspring distribution , @xmath68 , changes slowly from the initial narrow distribution to a broad distribution with a power - law at intermediate times @xcite .",
    "the broad distribution at intermediate times is at the heart of the correspondence of genealogies in models of adapting populations and the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent .",
    "the bsc assumes that all individuals are exchangeable and that in every coalescent event a randomly chosen set of lineages merges into one .",
    "each possible merger event has a specific rate associated with it , and the rate at which @xmath69 individuals merge into one common ancestor is @xmath70 @xcite ( the general expression for the rates is given below in eq .",
    "( [ eq : genbs ] ) ) .",
    "in contrast , in the neutral coalescent , higher order coalescence is very rare @xmath71 .",
    "we will present the basic properties of the bsc briefly in the discussion .    to appreciate how these coalescence rates can emerge from a model with selection , consider the number of individuals @xmath72 that descend from an individual @xmath73 that lived @xmath67 generations in the past .",
    "the probability that @xmath69 individuals sampled randomly from the population have a common ancestor @xmath67 in the past is then given by @xmath74 where the average @xmath75 is over all @xmath72 .",

    "the branching process approximation used to derive the result eq .",
    "( [ eq : bsrates ] ) is valid only for short times but nevertheless gives us the relative rates of multiple mergers once coalescence sets in . for subsequent deeper coalescent events ,",
    "the relevant lineages are already at the tip of the fitness distribution , and this process repeats itself without the delay .",
    "in fact , after this delay all remaining lineages are in a narrow region at the tip of the fitness distribution .",
    "the situation now resembles that of coalescence in fkpp waves : the fitness of the lineages is roughly equal , but lineages have to stay ahead of a fitness cut - off in order to survive .",
    "we can therefore employ the phenomenological theory of genealogies in fkpp waves from @xcite , which confirms the above result for the coalescent time scale ; see si .",
    "we present an additional argument based on `` tuned '' models introduced in @xcite in the si .    to corroborate our analysis",

    "these simulations show that the pair coalescent time is indeed exponential with characteristic time @xmath29 after a delay of the same length ; see fig .",
    "the algorithm used is similar in spirit to the algorithm by brunet et al .",

    ".    strictly speaking , the analogy to an exchangeable coalescent model like the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent requires that different coalescence events one lineage undergoes be independent .",

    "the models of adaptation we have studied have a narrow offspring distribution .",
    "nevertheless , the exponential amplification of fit genotypes over many generations gives rise to a distribution of clone sizes with the required asymptotic behavior .",

    "more elaborate analysis based on a fitness - class coalescent explicitly tracks lineages through the population and calculates the contribution to coalescence before lineages reach the mutation free class @xcite .",

    "we thus argue that the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent generically emerges as a consequence of the exponential amplification of the clones descending from these highly fit individuals , together with the seeding of novel lineages .",

    "whether the bsc also describes genealogies in scenarios where fitness is increased in rather large increments ( compared to the population diversity ) @xcite remains an interesting topic for future work .",

    "sexual populations and recurrent selective sweeps at linked loci can also give rise to multiple mergers in the genealogies @xcite .",
    "however , recombination and sexual reproduction will reduce the effects of linked selection and decouple the genealogies of different loci .",
