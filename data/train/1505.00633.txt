    ". the likely presence of a new soft component in the x - ray spectrum of hen  3 - 461 encourage to propose a @xmath37-type classification .",
    "no x - ray spectral type was proposed for 4  dra and given the results obtained from the spectral fit , we advocate for a @xmath21-type categorization .",
    "finally , the broadband energy coverage now shows that eg  and should be considered a @xmath21-type instead of @xmath54-type source as originally proposed by @xcite .",
    "while the @xmath21 components in the @xcite sample were all heavily absorbed , this is not universally true of all @xmath21 components ; hen  3 - 1591 , eg  and and 4  dra are all lightly absorbed and detected below 1 kev .",
    "when compared with earlier data , all sources show changes in their intrinsic flux and n@xmath55 . in paper i we proposed a scenario where the @xmath21-type x - ray emission in symbiotics originates in the accretion disk boundary layer , implying that long term changes in the x - ray flux are mostly due to changes in the accretion rate to the disk while changes in the soft x - rays can also be caused by variations in the amount of absorbing material .",
    "it is still unknown where the absorber is located .",
    "the days - to - week time scale changes in n@xmath56 observed in the @xmath21-type prototype rt  cru @xcite suggest that the absorber is located close to the wd .",
    "however it is unclear if these changes are related and if so , how they are related , with the amount of material entering the accretion disk . in our study",
    "we witness that although high flux states encompass high n@xmath55 in the case of cd  -28 - 3719 and 4  dra , in the case of hen  3 - 461 , n@xmath55 is higher now while f@xmath35 is lower than when observed with _ swift _ ( see table 2 in paper i ) .",
    "our crude spectral fit indicates that the amount of absorption of the hard x - ray component in hen  3 - 461 has increased considerably and possibly a separate soft spectral component has emerged .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity has decreased by about 30% since the _ swift _ observation in 2010 .",
    "although not contemporaneous uv data are available , galex ( nuv ) observations taken one year before our _ suzaku _ data indicate that the f@xmath57=1.86@xmath1210@xmath58 erg @xmath14 s@xmath15 , then f@xmath57/f@xmath59 0.7 ( we quote the lower limit as the reddening for this source is unknown ) and thus the accretion disk boundary layer seems to be still in the optically thin regime . in paper",
    "i we proposed a scenario where the soft emission of @xmath37-type objects could be related with a colliding - wind region or jets .",
    "we could be witnessing the clear - up of a colliding - wind region .",
    "the equivalent width of the ( unresolved ) fe k@xmath60 region of around 400 ev resembles the values found by @xcite on the well - known jet source with a two - component x - ray spectra , ch  cyg .    our best - fit model for points out to the presence of a white dwarf as the accreting compact object instead of a neutron star , i.e. a white dwarf symbiotic instead of a symbiotic x - ray binary as previously though .",
    "evidence supporting this scenario also comes from the optical spectra which shows many emission lines of a variety of ions , similar to that of a planetary nebula , where the strong uv radiation field from the wd photoionizes the surrounding nebulae .",
    "@xcite detected the flickering behavior in the b band data of this object , which suggests that the blue light is from an accretion disk .",
    "hen  3 - 1591 belongs to a rare subclass of @xmath61-type yellow symbiotics , with a dusty ir continuum and they belong to the galactic disk , so low metallicity is not implicated .",
    "they are interpreted as systems in which the hot component has recently evolved from the agb to the white dwarf stage . in this interpretation , the dust is from the mass lost by the agb star , and the nebulosity is in fact the planetary nebula ( pne ) , and neither is due to the present - day giant ( see jorissen et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) .",
    "if we compare with the well - known classical novae gk  per @xcite and v458  vul @xcite , both claimed to be a classical nova inside a planetary nebula and if the pne phase is as short as thought ( 10 - 20 kyr ; @xcite ) , we might question the white dwarf nature of the accretor which should be still a hot subdwarf .",
    "hen  3 - 1591 also shows the _ barium syndrome _ , i.e. overabundances of @xmath51-process elements and the presence of single - ionized barium which can not be explained if the red giant is not part of a binary system @xcite .",
    "the now - observed red giant had its photosphere polluted by @xmath51-processed elements by the previously - agb companion , that now should be a wd .",
    "thus , our high signal - to - noise , broadband _ suzaku _ spectrum adds more support to the presence of a wd or hot subdwarf .",
    "if we use the plasma temperature from the cooling flow model to derive the wd mass , we obtain m@xmath62= 0.45 m@xmath63 , on the low - side of the wd mass distribution . the high temperature of the plasma strongly suggest that in hen  3 - 1591 the x - ray emission arise in an accretion disk boundary layer instead of a colliding wind region .",
    "the strong - shock condition implies wind speed s of around 3,000 km s@xmath15 for the observed temperatures , and such high speeds outflows or winds had not been detected so far in hen  3 - 1591 or any other symbiotic .",
    "the lack of uv data does not allow to use the ratio of uv and x - ray fluxes as a proxy for the optical depth of the boundary layer .",
    "the decrease of temperature and luminosity ( i.e. accretion rate ) between asca and _ suzaku _ observations , however , suggest that the optical depth of the x - ray emitting plasma has changed , being higher during _ suzaku _ observation and thus we might have observed an smaller optically thin portion of the boundary layer .",
    "based on the high temperature found for the x - ray emitting plasma , we can also rule out colliding winds as the source of x - rays in eg  and .",
    "this source was identified as a @xmath54-type symbiotic by @xcite .",
    "those authors derived a temperature for the x - ray emitting plasma 1.3@xmath70.5 kev using rosat pspc data .",
    "this value is much lower than the temperature found from our modeling of the _ suzaku _ spectrum ( 5 - 10 kev ) and is much likely due to the lack of sensitivity above 2 kev of the rosat spectrum .",
    "the velocity implied by the best fit to the _ suzaku _ spectrum is around a few thousand km s@xmath15 .",
    "this is much faster than the highest velocity line features ( @xmath1700 km s@xmath15 , c iv 1548 , 1550absorption features ) found in uv spectra from fuse and stis by @xcite , and difficult to explain in a low mass white dwarf like the one in eg  and ( m@xmath640.4 m@xmath63 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . instead , we propose that the x - rays originate in the accretion disk boundary layer around a low mass wd .",
    "we estimate the wd mass taking into account the relationship between the @xmath8 from the spectral modeling ( @xmath8=7@xmath34 kev ) , kt@xmath1(1/10)@xmath65m@xmath66(gm@xmath62/r@xmath62 ) , where @xmath65 is the mean molecular weight and @xmath67 is the proton mass and the wd mass - radius relationship from @xcite , we obtain a mass m@xmath640.5 m@xmath63 .",
    "if the hot - component luminosities reported in the literature ( 16 - 400 @xmath68;@xcite ) are due to an accretion - powered white dwarf , then the implied accretion rates are in the range 10@xmath69 to 10@xmath70 m@xmath63 yr@xmath15 for a 0.4 m@xmath63 wd .",
    "this is squarely in the regime where the boundary layer is expected to be optically thick according to models by @xcite .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is lower than @xmath71 , suggesting that the x - rays are produced in a region that remains optically thin at the outer surface of the mostly optically thick boundary layer .",
    "although we expect x - ray emission due to accretion to be highly variable , eg  and is very faint and we do not detect enough photons to be sensitive to low - level variability ( @xmath72 50% ) .",
    "our _ suzaku _ observations of 4  dra , when considered along with previous uv observations @xcite , indicate that 4  dra is an accretion - powered symbiotic ( i.e. , no quasi - steady shell burning on the surface of the wd ) in which mass transfer at @xmath110@xmath69 m@xmath63 yr@xmath15 produces an optically thick boundary layer around a @xmath10.6 m@xmath63 wd .",
    "we obtain this rough estimate of @xmath73 from our inference that the boundary layer is optically thick .",
    "@xcite suggest that the accretion rates needed to produce a predominantly optically thick boundary layer around wds of masses 1.0 , 0.8 , and 0.6 m@xmath63 are greater than 10@xmath70 , a few times 10@xmath69 , and @xmath110@xmath69 m@xmath63 yr@xmath15 , respectively . taking the uv flux at the time of the _ suzaku _ observation to be comparable to the @xmath110 l@xmath63 detected by iue",
    ", the bl being optically thick suggests that the wd mass is less than about 0.6 m@xmath63 ( for which the iue luminosity corresponds to accretion rates of @xmath110@xmath69 m@xmath63 yr@xmath15 ) .",
    "in contrast to higher - mass wds with optically thick boundary layers ( such as rs  oph and ss  cyg ) , the small amount of x - ray emitting plasma associated with the optically thick boundary layer around 4  dra is just as hot as would be expected for an optically thin boundary layer .",
    "we emphasize that our conclusions about the optical depth of the accretion disk boundary layer and its implications on the wd mass depend on the assumed viscosity parameter , @xmath60 and other assumptions on the models described by @xcite .",
    "as noted in paper i , a 30% change in @xmath60 leads to a factor - of - a - few change on the threshold accretion rate .",
    "allowing for this , the white dwarf in 4  dra is smaller than about 0.7 m@xmath63 , still a low mass .",
    "both fitting approaches discussed in section [ sec : res4dra ] yield equally possible scenarios . in the case that both spectra are modeled independently , we can understand that the measured temperatures are different because the optical depth of the emitting region has changed , i.e. during the earliest observation the boundary layer was thicker and the measured temperature and fluxes of the x - ray emitting plasma were lower . on the other hand ,",
    "if we assume that during both observations the plasma temperature was the same ( the optical depth of the boundary layer and the mass of the wd have not changed between observations ) we still obtain acceptable fits with an increase in the amount of absorbing material and the intrinsic luminosity during the last observation , perhaps due to an increase in the accretion rate .    the orbital solution for 4  dra was studied by @xcite , conducting a radial velocity study of the m giant and found a 1,703@xmath73 days period , an eccentric orbit ( @xmath74=0.3 ) and t@xmath75[mjd]= 53204@xmath719 .",
    "the rosat observations thus occurred at orbital phases @xmath32=0.33 , 0.15 and 0.61 , while _",
    "suzakus _ occurred at @xmath76=0.23 and @xmath77=0.57 .",
    "if the x - ray absorbing material is tied to the orbital motion of the wd , thus the absorption columns obtained from the fits of the _ suzaku _ observations should not be very different given than during obsid 4050 the system was near quadrature while during obsid 4060 the system was in inferior conjunction , thus from the values in table [ tab : models ] and since an undisturbed m giant wind would account for only @xmath1a few times 10@xmath78 cm@xmath30 @xcite , we can conclude that the absorber material is located relatively near the white dwarf and probably intimately connected with the physics of accretion .",
