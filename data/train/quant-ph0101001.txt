    "this is the second in a series of three papers @xcite exploring the regime of stochastic behavior manifested by relativistic particles moving through quantum fields .",
    "this series highlights the intimate connections between backreaction , dissipation , noise , and correlation , focusing on the necessity ( and the consequences ) of a self - consistent treatment of nonlinearly interacting quantum dynamical particle - field systems .",
    "in paper i @xcite , we have set up the basic framework built on the influence functional and worldline quantization formalism . in this paper",
    "we apply the results obtained there to spinless relativistic moving particles in a quantum scalar field .",
    "the interaction is chosen to be the scalar analog of qed coupling so that we can avoid the complications of photon polarizations and gauge invariance in an electromagnetic field .",
    "the results here should describe correctly particle motion when spin and photon polarization are unimportant , and when the particle is sufficiently decohered such that its quantum fluctuations effectively produce stochastic dynamics .",
    "the main results of this investigation are    1 .   first principle derivation of a time - dependent ( modified ) abraham - lorentz - dirac ( ald ) equation as the consistent semiclassical limit for nonlinear particle - scalar - field systems without making the dipole or non - relativistic approximations .",
    "consistent resolution of the paradoxes of the ald equations , including the problems of runaway and acausal ( e.g. pre - accelerating ) solutions , and other `` pathologies '' . we show how the non - markovian nature of the quantum particle open - system enforces causality in the equations of motion .",
    "we also discuss the crucial conceptual role that decoherence plays in understanding these problems .",
    "derivation of multiparticle abraham - lorentz - dirac - langevin ( aldl ) equations describing the quantum stochastic dynamics of relativistic particles .",
    "the familiar classical abraham - lorentz - dirac ( ald ) equation is reached as its _ noise - averaged _ form .",
    "the stochastic regime , characterized by balanced noise and dissipation , plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between quantum and ( emergent ) classical behaviors .",
    "the n - particle - irreducible ( npi ) and master effective action @xcite provide a route for generalizing our treatment to the _ self - consistent _ inclusion of higher order quantum corrections .",
    "we divide our introduction into three parts : first , a discussion of the pathologies and paradoxes of the ald equation from the conventional approach and our suggested cures based on proper treatment of causal and non - markovian behavior and self - consistent backreaction .",
    "second , misconceptions in the relation between radiation reaction , quantum dissipation and vacuum fluctuations and the misplaced nature and role of fluctuation - dissipation relations .",
    "finally we give a brief summary of previous work and describe their shortcomings which justify a new approach as detailed here .",
    "the classical theory of moving charges interacting with a classical electromagnetic field has controversial difficulties associated with backreaction @xcite .",
    "the generally accepted classical equation of motion in a covariant form for charged , spinless point particles , including radiation - reaction , is the abraham - lorentz - dirac ( ald ) equation @xcite : @xmath0 the timescale @xmath1 determines the relative importance of the radiation - reaction term . for electrons , @xmath2 secs , which is roughly the time it takes light to cross the electron classical radius @xmath3 m .",
    "the ald equation has been derived in a variety of ways , often involving some regularization procedure that renormalizes the particle s mass @xcite .",
    "feynman and wheeler have derived this result from their `` absorber '' theory which symmetrically treats both advanced and retarded radiation on the same footing @xcite .",
    "the ald equation has strange features , whose status are still debated .",
    "because it is a third order differential equation , it requires the specification of extra initial data ( e.g. the initial acceleration ) in addition to the usual position and velocity required by first order hamiltonian systems .",
    "this leads to the existence of runaway solutions .",
    "physical ( e.g. non - runaway ) solutions may be enforced by transforming ( [ classical lorentz - dirac equation ] ) to a second order integral equation with boundary condition such that the final energy of the particle is finite and consistent with the total work done on it by external forces .",
    "but the removal of runaway solutions comes at a price , because solutions to the integral equation exhibit the acausal phenomena of pre - acceleration on timescales @xmath4 this is the source of lingering questions on whether the classical theory of point particles and fields is causal .",
    "there have been notable efforts to understand charged particle radiation - reaction in the classical and quantum theory ( for a review see @xcite ) , of which extended charge theories @xcite and quantum langevin equations are important examples @xcite ( see subsection c below ) .",
    "the stochastic regime is characterized by competition between quantum and statistical processes : particularly , quantum correlations versus decoherence , and fluctuations versus dissipation .",
    "the close association of vacuum fluctuations with radiation - reaction is well - known , but the precise relationship between them requires clarification .",
    "it is commonly asserted that vacuum fluctuations ( vf ) are balanced by radiation reaction ( rr ) through a fluctuation - dissipation relation ( fdr ) .",
    "this can be misleading .",
    "radiation reaction is a classical process ( i.e. , @xmath5 ) while vacuum fluctuations are quantum in nature .",
    "a counter - example to the claim that there is a direct link between rr and vf is the uniformly accelerated charged particle ( uap ) for which the classical radiation reaction force vanishes , but vacuum fluctuations do not .",
    "however , at the stochastic level variations in the radiation reaction force away from the classical averaged value exist  it is this quantum dissipation effect which is related to vacuum fluctuations by a fdr .    from discussions in paper",
    "i we see how decoherence enters in the quantum to classical transition . under reasonable physical conditions",
    "@xcite the influence action or decoherence functional is dominated by the classical solution ( via the stationary phase approximation ) . also from the ` non - markovian '",
    "fluctuation - dissipation relations found in paper i , we see that the relationship between noise and dissipation is extremely complicated . here",
    "too , decoherence plays a role in the emergence of the usual type fluctuation - dissipation kernel , just as it plays a role in the emergence of classicality . when there is sufficient decoherence , the fdr kernel ( see eq .",
    "( 5.23 ) in paper i ) is dominated by the self - consistent semiclassical ( decoherent ) trajectories .",
    "an approximate , linear fdr relation may be obtained ( see eq . ( 5.24 ) in paper i ) except that the kernel is self - consistently determined in terms of the average ( mean ) system history , and the fdr describes the balance of fluctuations and dissipation about those mean trajectories .",
    "these observations have important ramifications on the appropriateness of assigning a fdr for radiation reaction and vacuum fluctuations .",
    "ordinary ( e.g. classical ) radiation reaction is consistent with the mean particle trajectories determined by including the backreaction force from the field .",
    "but at the classical level , there are no fluctuations , and hence no fluctuation - dissipation relation . even regarding radiation reaction as a ` damping ' mechanism is misleading",
    "it is not ` dissipation ' in the true statistical mechanical sense . unlike a particle moving in some viscous medium",
    "whose velocity is damped , radiation reaction generally vanishes for inertial ( e.g. constant velocity ) particles moving in vacuum fields ( e.g. qed ) .",
    "furthermore , radiation reaction can both _ ` damp ' _ and _ anti_-_`damp ' _ particle motion , though the average effect is usually a damping one . on the other hand ,",
    "we show that the fluctuations around the mean - trajectory are damped , as described by a fdr . at the quantum stochastic level as discussed here , quantum dissipation effect results from the _ changes _ in the radiation reaction force that are associated with fluctuations in the particle trajectory around the mean , and therefore it is _ not _ the same force as the classical ( i.e. average ) radiation reaction force .",
    "only these quantum processes obey a fdr .",
    "this is a subtle noteworthy point .      1 .",
    "there are many works on _",
    "non_relativistic quantum ( and semiclassical ) radiation reaction ( for atoms as well as charges moving in quantum fields ) including those by rohrlich , moniz - sharp , cohen - tannoudji et .",
    "al . , milonni , and others @xcite .",
    "kampen , moniz , sharp , and others @xcite suggested that the problems of causality and runaways can be resolved in both classical and quantum theory by considering extended charge models .",
    "however , this approach , while quite interesting , misses the point that point particles ( like local quantum field theories ) obey a good low energy effective theory in their own right .",
    "while it is true that extended objects can cure infinities ( e.g. , extended charge models , string theory ) , it is nonetheless important to recognize that at sufficiently low energy qed as an effective field theory is ` consistent ' without recourse to its high - energy limit .",
    "wilson , weinberg and others @xcite have shown how effective theory description is sufficient to understand low energy physics because complicated , and often irrelevant , high energy details of the fine structure are not being probed at the physical energy scales of interest .",
    "the effective theory approach has also provided a new perspective on the physical meaning of renormalization and the source of divergences , showing why nonrenormalizable interactions _ are not _ a disaster , why the apparent large shift in bare - parameters resulting from divergent loop diagrams ( i.e. renormalization ) does nt invalidate perturbation theory , and clarifying how and when high - energy structure _ does _ effect low - energy physics .",
    "therefore one should not need to invoke extended charge theory to understand low energy particle dynamics . +",
    "our work is a relativistic treatment which includes causal non - markovian behavior and self - consistent backreaction .",
    "we think this is a better approach even in a nonrelativistic context because the regularized relativistic theory never ` breaks down ' . in our approach",
    "we adopt the ideas and methods of effective field theory with proper treatment of backreaction to account for the effects of high - energy ( short - distance ) structure on low - energy behavior , and to demonstrate the self - consistency of the semiclassical particle dynamics .",
    "we consider the consequences of coarse - graining the irrelevant ( environmental ) degrees of freedom , and the nature of vacuum fluctuations and quantum dissipation in the radiation reaction problem .",
    "we emphasize the crucial role of decoherence due to noise in resolving the pathologies and paradoxes , and in seeing how causal qed leads to a ( short - time modified ) causal ald semiclassical limit .",
    "by examining the time - dependence of operator canonical commutation relations milonni showed the necessity of electromagnetic field vacuum fluctuations for radiating _",
    "charges @xcite .",
    "the conservation of the canonical commutation relations is a fundamental requirement of the quantum theory . yet ,",
    "if a quantum particle is coupled to a _ classical _ electromagnetic field , radiative losses ( dissipation ) lead to a contraction in `` phase - space '' for the expected values of the particle position and momentum , which violates the commutation relations .",
    "it is the vacuum field that balances the dissipation effect , preserving the commutation relations @xmath6",
    "= i\\hbar$ ] as a consequence of a fluctuation - dissipation relation ( fdr ) .",
    "the particle - centric worldline framework allows us to consider similar issues for relativistic particles .",
    "interestingly , our covariant framework shows how quantum fluctuations ( manifesting as noise ) appear in both the time and space coordinates of a particle .",
    "this is not surprising since relativity requires that a physical particle satisfies @xmath7 and therefore any variation in spatial velocities must be balanced by a change in @xmath8 keeping the particle `` on - shell '' .",
    "3 .   the derivation and use of quantum langevin equations ( qle s ) to describe fluctuations of a system in contact with a quantum environment has a long history .",
    "typically , qle s are assumed to describe fluctuations in the linear response regime for a system around equilibrium , but its validity does not need be so restrictive .",
    "nonequilibrium conditions can be treated with the feynman - vernon influence functional .",
    "caldeira and leggett s study of quantum brownian motion ( qbm ) has led to an extensive literature @xcite , particularly in regard to decoherence issues@xcite .",
    "barone and caldeira @xcite have applied this method to the question of whether nonrelativistic , dipole coupled electrons decohere in a quantum electromagnetic field .",
    "an advantage of barone and caldeira s work is that it is not limited to initially factorized states ; they use the preparation function method which allows the inclusion of initial particle field correlations . despite this , romero and paz have pointed out that the preparation function method still suffers from an ( implicit ) unphysical depiction of instantaneous measurement characterizing the initial state preparation @xcite .",
    "ford , lewis , and oconnell have extensively discussed the electromagnetic field as a thermal bath in the linear , dipole coupled regime @xcite , and pioneered the application of qle s to nonrelativistic particle motion in qed .",
    "they have detailed the conditions for causality in the thermodynamic , equilibrium limit described by the late - time linear quantum langevin equation .",
    "a crucial point of their analysis is that particle motion can be ( depending on the cutoff of the field spectral density ) runaway free and causal in the late - time limit @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", they suggest a form of the equations of motion that gives fluctuations without dissipation for a free electron , but this result is special to the particular choice of a field cutoff made by the authors , namely , one implying that the bare mass of the particle exactly vanishes .",
    "when one does not assume a special value for the cutoff one generally does find both fluctuations and dissipation , though ford and lewis s counter - example shows how careful one must be in handling fdrs .",
    "another counter - example against making hasty generalizations is the vanishing of the averaged ( classical ) radiation reaction for uniformly accelerated particles despite quantum fluctuations that make the ( suitably coarse - grained ) trajectories stochastic .",
    "+ we do agree with the result that the particle motion is only causal and consistent when the field cutoff is below a certain critical value ( determined from the particles classical radius ) , but we find no compelling justification for the claim that the cutoff _ should _ take exactly that special value .",
    "+ it is certainly interesting that with the special field - cutoff chosen by ford and oconnell higher time - derivatives vanish from the equations of motion .",
    "however , even without such a specially chosen cutoff , the influence of higher derivative terms are strongly suppressed at low energies . on this issue",
    "we take the effective theory point of view which emphasizes the generic insensitivity of low - energy phenomena to unobserved high - energy structures . since higher - time derivatives in the equations of motion do not ( necessarily )",
    "violate causality , there is no reason to rule them out .",
    "it is perhaps instructive to review the meaning of renormalizable field theories in the light of effective theories .",
    "effective theories generically have higher derivative interactions that are again strongly suppressed at low energies .",
    "what makes renormalizable terms special is that these are the interactions that remain relevant ( or marginal ) at low energies , while non - renormalizable terms ( such as higher derivative terms ) are exponentially suppressed , hence , it is no longer believed that non - renormalizable terms are fundamentally excluded so long as one recognizes that physical theories are mostly effective theories . since qed is certainly an effective theory , these observations ( together with the suppression of the higher time - derivative terms ) weaken the argument that the special cutoff theory of fol is fundamental .",
    "ford and oconnell also propose a relativistic generalization of their modified equations of motion for the average trajectory derived from the nonrelativistic qle @xcite .",
    "our derivation of the stochastic limit from a relativistic quantum mechanics ( i.e. worldline formulation ) and field theory goes well beyond this by allowing the treatment of fully quantum relativistic processes , and by deriving a relativistic langevin equation .",
    "5 .   a perturbative expansion of the ald equation up to order",
    "@xmath9 has been derived from qed field theory by krivitskii and tsytovich @xcite , including the additional forces arising from particle spin .",
    "their work shows that the ald equation may also be understood from field theory , but the authors have not addressed the role of fluctuations , correlation , decoherence , time - dependent renormalization , nor self - consistent backreaction .",
    "our derivation yields the full ald equation ( all orders in @xmath10 for the perturbation expansion employed by @xcite ) through the loop ( semiclassical ) expansion ; this method automatically includes all tree - level diagrammatic effects .",
    "low @xcite showed that runaway solutions apparently do not occur in spin 1/2 qed .",
    "but low does not derive the ald  equation , nor address the semiclassical / stochastic limit .",
    "we also emphasize , again , that it does not , and should not , matter whether particles are spin 1/2 , spin 0 , or have some other internal structure in regard to the causality of the low energy effective theory for center of mass particle motion .",
    "7 .   using the influence functional",
    ", disi @xcite derives a markovian master equation in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "in contrast , it is our intent to emphasize the non - markovian and nonequilibrium regimes with special attention paid to self - consistency .",
    "the work of @xcite differs from ours in the treatment of the influence functional as a functional of particle trajectories in the relativistic worldline quantization framework .",
    "ford has considered the loss of electron coherence from vacuum fluctuation induced noise with the same noise kernel that we employ @xcite . however , his application concerns the case of fixed or predetermined trajectories .      in section",
    "ii we obtain the influence functional ( if ) for spinless relativistic particles .",
    "we then define the stochastic effective action @xmath11 for this model , using our results from paper i , and use it to derive nonlinear integral langevin equations for multiparticle spacetime motion . in section iii",
    "we consider the single particle case .",
    "we derive the ( scalar - field ) abraham - lorentz - dirac ( ald ) equation as the self - consistent semiclassical limit , and show how this limit emerges free of all pathologies .",
    "in section iv we derive a langevin equation for the stochastic fluctuations of the particle spacetime coordinates about the semiclassical limit for both the one particle and multiparticle cases .",
    "we also show how a stochastic version of the ward - takahashi identities preserves the mass - shell constraint . in section",
    "v , we give a simple example of these equations for a single free particle in a scalar field .",
    "we find that in this particular case the quantum field induced noise vanishes , though this result is special to the overly - simple scalar field , and does not hold for the electromagnetic field @xcite . in the final section ,",
    "we summarize our main results and mention areas of applications , of both theoretical and practical interest .",
    "relativistic quantum theories are usually focused primarily on quantized fields , the notion of particles following trajectories is somewhat secondary . as explained in paper i @xcite , we employ a `` hybrid '' model in which the environment is a field , but the system is the collection of particle spacetime coordinates @xmath12 ( i.e. , worldlines ) where @xmath13 indicates the @xmath14 particle coordinate , with worldline parameter @xmath15 charge @xmath16 and mass @xmath17 the free particle action is @xmath18=\\sum_{n}\\int d\\tau_{n}\\sqrt{\\left ( \\dot{z}_{n}^{\\mu}\\right ) ^{2}}% \\left [ m_{n}+v(z_{n}(\\tau_{n}))\\right ] .",

    "the scalar current is @xmath22 where @xmath23 in paper iii @xcite , we treat a vector current coupled to the electromagnetic vector potential @xmath24 . in both cases we assume spinless particles .",
    "the inclusion of spin or color is important to making full use of these methods in qed and qcd .    in the full quantum theory reparametrization invariance of the relativistic",
    "particle plays a crucial role , and the particle - field interaction must respect this symmetry . when dealing with the path integral for the quantized particle worldline ,",
    "a quadratic form of the action is often more convenient than the square - root action in ( [ square - root action ] ) .",
    "the worldline quantum theory is a gauge theory because of the constraint that follows from reparametrization invariance under @xmath25 making this perhaps the simplest physical example of a generally covariant theory .",
    "( we may therefore view this work as a toy model for general relativity , and for string theory , in the semiclassical and stochastic regime . )",
    "the path integral must therefore be gauge - fixed to prevent summing over gauge - equivalent histories . in @xcite we treat the full quantum theory , in detail , and derive the `` worldline influence functional '' after fixing the gauge to the so - called proper - time gauge .",
    "this give the worldline path integral in terms of a sum over particle trajectories @xmath26 satisfying @xmath27 but where the path integral still involves an integration over possible @xmath28 ( the range of this integration depends on the boundary conditions for the problem at hand ) .",
    "however , applying the semiclassical ( i.e. , loop ) expansion in @xcite we find that the @xmath29 trajectory gives the stationary phase solution ; hence , the semiclassical limit corresponds to setting @xmath30 in the following we will therefore assume the constraint @xmath31 or even @xmath32 when we are discussing the semiclassical limit for trajectories . we show that this is self - consistent in that it is preserved by the equations of motion including noise - induced fluctuations in the particle trajectory . since we are addressing the semiclassical / stochastic limit in this paper there is no need to adopt the quadratic form of action for a relativistic particle ; it is adequate , and it turns out to be simpler in this paper , to just work with the scalar functions @xmath33 defined in ( [ definition of u ] ) , and the square - root form of the relativistic particle action in ( [ square - root action ] ) .",
    "while we emphasize the microscopic quantum origins , we might also view our model in analogy to the treatment of quantum fields in curved spacetime .",
    "there , one takes the gravitational field ( spacetime ) as a classical system coupled to quantum fields . one important class of problems is then the backreaction of quantum fields on the classical spacetime .",
    "the backreaction of their mean yields the semiclassical einstein equation which forms the basis of semiclassical gravity .",
    "the inclusion of fluctuations of the stress - energy of the quantum fields and the induced metric fluctuations yields the einstein - langevin equations @xcite which forms the basis of this stochastic semiclassical gravity @xcite . in our work here , the particle coordinates are analogous to the gravitational field ( metric tensor ) .",
    "whereas the einstein - langevin equations have not been derived from first principles for the lack of a quantum theory of gravity , we shall take advantage of the existence of a full quantum theory of particles and fields to examine how , and when , a regime of stochastic behavior emerges .",
    "the interaction between the particles and a scalar field is given by the monopole coupling term @xmath34 this is the general type of interaction treated in paper i. in the second line we have used the expression for the current ( [ current ] ) .",

    "one does not need to know the detailed structure of the correct high - energy theory because low - energy processes are largely insensitive to them @xcite beyond the effective renormalization of system parameters and suppressed high - energy corrections .",

    "we should further elaborate , however , on the role of causality in the equations of motion . in the preceding paragraph",

    "the proper - time dependence of the mass renormalization is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the horizontal axis marks the proper time in units of the cutoff timescale @xmath258 the vertical scale is arbitrary , depending on the particle mass .",
    "notice one unusual feature : the mass shift is not monotonic with time , but instead first overshoots its final asymptotic value .",
    "this occurs because there are two competing mass renormalizing interactions that have slightly different timescales .",
    "the time - dependent mass - shift is a rapid effect , the final dressed mass is reached within a few @xmath259      the constants @xmath260 determine how quickly the particle is able to rebuild its own self - field , which in turn controls the backreaction on the particle motion , ensuring that it is causal .",
    "we have found , as is typical of effective field theories , that the equations of motion involve higher derivative terms ( i.e. @xmath261 for @xmath262 ) beyond the usual ald form .",

    "the higher - derivative corrections proportional to @xmath271 , suppressed by powers of the high - energy scale @xmath272 correspond to so - called irrelevant couplings .",
    "if we had written the most general action for the particle - field system consistent with lorentz and reparametrization invariance , we should have included from the beginning higher - derivative interactions .",
    "the effective field theory methodology when carried out fully shows that these high - derivative interactions are in fact irrelevant at low - energies .",
    "therefore , the ordinary ald form for radiation reaction ( e.g. , the @xmath270 term ) results not as a consequence of the details of the ` true ' high - energy theory , but because any lorentz and reparametrization invariant effective theory behaves like a renormalizable particle - field theory that has the aldequation as the low - energy limit . with this we come to the important conclusion that for a wide class of theories with the appropriate symmetries the low - energy limit of radiation reaction for ( center of mass ) particle motion is given by the ald result",
    ". for theories with additional structure ( such as spin ) , there will of course be additional radiation reaction terms important at the energy scale associated with the additional structure .    in figure 3",
    "we show the proper - time dependence of @xmath273 , with the same horizontal timescale as in figure 2 .",
    "it is evident that the radiation reaction force approaches the ald form quickly , essentially on the cutoff time . while the radiation reaction force is non - markovian , the memory time of the field - environment is very short .",
    "the non - markovian evolution is characterized by the dependence of the coefficients @xmath230 and @xmath274 on the initial time @xmath257 but become effectively independent of @xmath190 after @xmath275 this is an example of the well - known behavior for quantum brownian motion models found in @xcite .",
    "the effectively transient nature of the short - time behavior helps justify our use of an initially uncorrelated ( factorizable ) particle and field state .",
    "also notice the role played by the particle s elapsed proper - time , @xmath276 for particles with small average velocities picks out a special frame . ]",
    "the particle s proper - time is roughly the background minkowski time coordinate @xmath252 in this case , the time - dependences of the renormalization effects are approximately the same as one would find in the non - relativistic situation , since @xmath277 . for rapidly moving particles time - dilation",
    "can significantly lengthen the observed timescales with respect to the background minkowski time .",
    "this indicates that highly relativistic particles will take longer ( with respect to background time @xmath278 to equilibrate with the quantum field / environment than do more slowly moving particles .",
    "finally , we note that the radiation reaction force is exactly half that found for the electromagnetic field .      we have shown that at low - energies and late - times the ald radiation reaction force is generic ( neglecting other particle structure , such as spin , which gives rise to additional low - energy corrections ) .",
    "but the classical ald equation is plagued with pathologies like acausal and runaway solutions .",
    "the equations of motion in the form ( [ integral equation ] ) are clearly unique and causal , they require only ordinary initial data , and do not have runaway solutions .",
    "however , it is instructive to see how the equations of motions in the form ( [ radiation reaction force],[semiclassical2 ] ) , involving higher derivatives , preserve the causal nature of the solutions with radiation reaction . to address these questions we now examine the early - time behavior of the equations of motion .",
    "the presence of higher derivatives in ( [ semiclassical2 ] ) is an inevitable consequence of converting from a set of nonlocal integral equation ( [ integral equation ] ) to a set of local differential equations ( [ radiation reaction force],[semiclassical2 ] ) . as differential equations , ( [ radiation reaction force],[semiclassical2 ] ) may seem to be unphysical at first - sight because of the apparent need to specify initial data @xmath279 for @xmath280 but the coupling constants @xmath260 satisfy the crucial property that @xmath281 for all @xmath282 we see this graphically for @xmath283 in figure 3 , and analytically for all @xmath260 in ( [ g(n ) ] ) .",
    "consequently , the particle self - force at @xmath284 identically vanishes ( to all orders ) , and only smoothly rebuilds as the particle s self - field is reconstituted .",
    "therefore , the initial data at @xmath285 is fully ( and uniquely ) determined by @xmath286 which only requires the ordinary newtonian initial data .",

( [ free particle langevin ] ) has the unique solution @xmath399 after recalling that @xmath400 that is , the same initial time behavior that gives unique ( runaway - free ) solutions for @xmath401 ( the semiclassical solution ) apply to @xmath304 ( the stochastic fluctuations ) .",
    "let us comment on the difference of our result from that of @xcite .",
    "first , the dissipation term in our equations of motion is relativistically invariant for motion in the vacuum , and vanishes for inertial motion .",
    "the equations of motion in @xcite are not ; the authors concluded that a particle moving through the scalar vacuum will experience a dissipation force proportional to its velocity in direct contradiction with experience .",
    "this result comes from an incorrect treatment of the retarded green s function in 1 + 1 spacetime dimensions- which is quite different in behavior than the green s function in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "we avoid this problem by working in the more physical three spatial dimensions .",
    "we furthermore find that a free particle in the scalar vacuum does not experience noise ( at least at the one - loop order of our derivation- see paper i ) .",
    "this result is somewhat special owing to the particular symmetries of the scalar theory . in paper iii , we find that charged particles experience noise in the electromagnetic field vacuum .",
    "we have not addressed in depth the degree of decoherence of the particle motion , and how well the langevin equation approximates the quantum expectation values for the particle motion is still an open question that will depend on the particular parameters ( e.g. , mass , charge , state of the field ) of the model .",
    "our result also differs from that of ford and oconnell , who propose that the field - cutoff take a special value with the consequence that a free electron experiences fluctuations without dissipation @xcite .",
    "we have already argued why this assumption is unnecessary as a consequence of recognizing qed as an effective theory .",
    "we have also emphasized the distinction between radiation reaction and dissipation .",
    "hence , we find that a free ( or for that matter a uniformly accelerated ) particle has vanishing average radiation reaction , but when there exists a fluctuating force inducing deviations from the free ( or uniformly accelerated ) trajectory , there is then a balancing dissipation backreaction force .",
    "what is a little unusual about the scalar - field - free - particle case is that the `` overly simple '' monopole coupling between the scalar field and particle does not lead to quantum fluctuation induced noise when the expectation value of the particles acceleration vanishes ( i.e. for a free particle ) . in paper iii @xcite , treating the electromagnetic ( vector ) field , there _ is _ quantum field induced noise and dissipation in the particle trajectory , for both free and accelerated motion .",
    "we now summarize the main results of this paper , what follows from here , and point out areas for potential applications of theoretical and practical values .",
    "perhaps the most significant difference between this and earlier work in terms of approach is the use of a particle - centric and initial value ( causal ) formulation of relativistic quantum field theory , in terms of world - line quantization and influence functional formalisms , with focus on the coarse - grained and stochastic effective actions and their derived stochastic equations of motion .",
    "this is a general approach whose range of applicability extends from the full quantum to the classical regime , and should not be viewed as an approximation scheme valid only for the semiclassical .",
    "there exists a great variety of physical problems where a particle - centric formulation is more adept than a field - centric formulation .",
    "the initial value formulation with full backreaction ensures the self - consistency and causal behavior of the equations of motion for the semiclassical limit of particles in qed whose solutions are pathology free the ald - langevin equations .    for further development , in paper iii @xcite we shall extend these results to spinless particles moving in the quantum electromagnetic field , where we need to deal with the issues of gauge invariance .",
    "we find that the electromagnetic field is a richer source of noise than the simpler scalar field treated here .",
    "the ald - langevin equations for charged particle motion in the quantum electromagnetic field derived in paper iii is of particular importance for quantum beam dynamics and heavy - ion physics .",
    "applying the ald - langevin equations to a charged particle moving in a constant background electric field ( with the quantum field in the vacuum state ) , we show that its motion experiences stochastic fluctuations that are identical to those experienced by a free particle ( i.e. , where there is no background electric or magnetic field ) moving in a thermal quantum field .",
    "this is an example of the unruh effect @xcite .",
    "the same effect exists for the scalar field example treated in this work , but we leave the essentially identical derivation for the more physically relevant case of qed presented in @xcite .    in a second series of papers @xcite , we use the same conceptual framework and methodology but go beyond the semiclassical and stochastic regimes to incorporate the full range of quantum phenomena , addressing questions such as the role of dissipation and correlation in charged particle pair - creation , and other quantum relativistic processes .    in conclusion ,",
    "our approach is appropriate for any situation where particle motion ( as opposed to field properties , say ) is the center of attention .",
    "our methods can be applied to relativistic charged particle motion not only in charged particle beams as in accelerators , and free - electron - lasers as in ion - optics , but also in strong fields such as particles moving in matter ( crystals ) or in plasma media as in astrophysical contexts @xcite .",
    "self - consistent treatment of backreaction from quantum field activities on a charged particle is an essential yet often neglected factor in many problems dealing with charged particle motion .",
    "first principles microscopic approach by means of covariant quantum field theory leading to microscopic stochastic equation is an effective remedy to this deficiency .    theoretically , by interpreting a particle s spacetime properties ( e.g. its location in time and space ) as effectively microscopic ` clocks and position markers ' ( e.g. events ) we see that a quantum - covariant description of particle ` worldline ' motion is not just particle dynamics , it is the quantum dynamics of spacetime events .",
    "for example , the `` time '' of the particle is treated as quantum variable on equal footing with position , and hence question like localization apply not just to localization in space , but localization in time",
    ". it would be natural to apply this approach to subjects like ` time of flight ' , that have become popular , and questions regarding decoherence of time ( variables ) , together with space variables ( e.g. the emergence of ( local ) time for particles ) .",
