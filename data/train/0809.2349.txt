    "<S> for a finite gain the scattering matrix departs from unitarity because the particle flux is no longer conserved due to the stimulated emission of photons in the active medium . even if the cold - cavity resonances are strongly overlapping for the cold cavity ( as is typical for low-@xmath22 modes with @xmath0 larger than the mode spacing ) , well - resolved resonances appear when one steers the system close to the laser threshold . </S>",
    "<S> dielectric microresonator design aims to support high-@xmath22 modes , which can be resolved even deep below threshold @xcite ; in that case , however , the threshold is reached more quickly than in the case of low-@xmath22 modes . </S>",

    "<S> the integral in the denominator is not restricted to the interior of the resonator , and the result does not feature the cold - cavity decay rate . for the latter reason eq.([eq : dogen ] ) can not be used to extract a generalized petermann factor .    in order to make contact with the conventional theory of the linewidth we now consider the regime @xmath59 of a large resonator . under this condition , </S>",
    "<S> typical resonances have a small cold - cavity decay rate , @xmath60 , and the laser threshold is attained at a small gain , @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ eq : pole ] ) then applies all the way down to the cold - cavity limit , and can be further recast to deliver the complex cold - cavity resonance frequency @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : coldwc ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result is perturbative in the gain but nonperturbative in the openness of the system , which is encoded in @xmath27 , @xmath26 , and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> note that in eq.([eq : coldwc ] ) , the numerator is determined by the active region , while the denominator also depends on the passive regions  including the region outside the resonator , where integrals are well defined because @xmath29 is real @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for homogeneous systems , the simple relation @xmath64 ( tm ) is often applied ( this also entails the relation for the laser threshold discussed above ) . in comparison to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : coldwc ] ) , this simple expression is only valid when one can ignore to the exterior contribution to the denominator , which in practice requires a very large system size .    with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : coldwc ] ) , linewidth ( [ eq : dogen ] ) simplifies to    [ eq : finalexpression ] @xmath65    which features the cold - cavity decay rate @xmath66 along with the cold - cavity line shift @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> ( far above the laser threshold , the linewidth is again halved because amplitude fluctuations are suppressed by the nonlinear feedback with the medium @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the petermann factor , hence , takes the form of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : genkall ] ) . for tm polarization , the conventional form [ eq .  ( [ eq : ksp ] ) ] of the petermann factor is recovered when the active medium fills the resonator homogeneously ( so that @xmath26 does not depend on position ) . </S>",
    "<S> this conceptual relation hence applies even when the mode structure in the resonator plane is strongly non - paraxial . </S>",

    "<S> , i assume that the gain is constrained to the annular region between these interfaces ( @xmath70 ) , but vanishes in the interior disk ( @xmath71 ) , and furthermore set @xmath72 and @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the radii of the two circles are related by @xmath74 , and the eccentricity is @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the finite eccentricity breaks the rotational symmetry and hence leads to nonintegrable classical ray dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the classical phase space accommodates domains of stability embedded into regions of chaotic instability and , hence , exhibits the full complexity of generic dynamical systems . </S>",

    "<S> the dashed blue curve is obtained when the petermann factor is taken of the homogeneous form @xmath19 [ eq .
