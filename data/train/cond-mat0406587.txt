    "<S> the theory of what happens to a superfluid in a random field , known as the `` dirty boson '' problem , directly relates to a real experimental system presently under study by several groups , namely excitons in coupled semiconductor quantum wells . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the case of bosons in two dimensions in a random field , when the random field can be large compared to the repulsive exciton - exciton interaction energy , but is small compared to the exciton binding energy . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between excitons is taken into account in the ladder approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the coherent potential approximation allows us to derive the exciton green s function for a wide range of the random field strength , and in the weak - scattering limit cpa results in the second - order born approximation . for quasi - two - dimensional excitonic systems , the density of the superfluid component and the kosterlitz - thouless temperature of the superfluid phase transition </S>",
    "<S> are obtained , and are found to decrease as the random field increases .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : 71.35.lk , 73.20.mf , 73.21.fg , 71.35.-y    key words : coupled quantum wells , superfluidity , indirect excitons , bose - einstein condensation of excitons    superfluidity in a system of spatially indirect excitons in coupled quantum wells ( cqw ) has been predicted by lozovik and yudson,@xcite and several subsequent studies@xcite have predicted that this should be manifested as persistent electric currents , quasi - josephson phenomena and unusual properties in strong magnetic fields . in the past ten years , a number of experimental studies have focused on this goal . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the coupled quantum well system is conceptually simple : negative electrons are trapped in a two - dimensional plane , while an equal number of positive holes is trapped in a parallel plane a distance @xmath0 away . </S>",
    "<S> one of the appeals of this system is that the electron and hole wavefunctions have very little overlap , so that the excitons can have very long lifetime ( @xmath1 ns ) , and therefore they can be treated as metastable particles to which quasiequilibrium statistics apply . </S>",
    "<S> also , when @xmath0 is large enough , the interactions between the excitons are entirely repulsive , so that the exciton gas is stable against collapse ( see , e.g. , ref . </S>",
    "<S> [ ] ) .    in general , the theory of these systems has neglected the role of disorder . in real experiments </S>",
    "<S> , however , disorder plays a major role , arising from impurities , boundary irregularities , and fluctuations of the alloy concentration of the epitaxial layers . </S>",
    "<S> although the quality of quantum well structures has improved dramatically over the past decade , e.g. , the inhomogeneous broadening linewidth of typical gaas - based samples has been improved from around 20 mev to less than 1 mev,@xcite the disorder energy is still not negligible compared to other energies . at a typical exciton density of @xmath2 @xmath3 , the interaction energy of the excitons is approximately @xmath4 mev ( @xmath5 being the characteristic radius of a @xmath6 exciton , @xmath7 the total mass , and @xmath8 the number density of excitons).@xcite typical thermal energies at liquid helium temperatures are @xmath9 mev . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the typical disorder energy of 1 mev is low compared to the typical exciton binding energy of 5 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> earlier studies of disorder in exciton systems include theory of the transport properties of direct and indirect excitons and magnetoexcitons in random fields,@xcite the influence of various random fields on excitonic and magnetoexcitonic absorption of light,@xcite and anderson localization of excitons.@xcite in two - dimensional systems , the excitonic interaction in the bogoliubov approximation is valid only at non - physically low densities because of the divergence of the two - dimensional scattering amplitude in the born approximation.@xcite therefore , the ladder approximation must be used at low densities to treat properly the interaction between two - dimensional excitons.@xcite in this letter we study the case of a random field which is not necessarily small compared to the dipole - dipole repulsion between excitons . </S>",
    "<S> the coherent potential approximation@xcite ( cpa ) allows us to derive the 2d indirect exciton green s function for a wide range of the random field , and in the weak - scattering limit cpa results in the second - order born approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above , fluctuations of the thickness of the quantum wells , which arise during the fabrication process , impurities in the system , and disorder in the alloy of the barriers can all lead to the appearance of a random field . of these </S>",
    "<S> , spectral analysis of the exciton luminescence shows that alloy disorder , with a characteristic length scale short compared to the excitonic bohr radius of around 100   , plays the most important role . in our model , the random potential @xmath10 acting on an electron and hole </S>",
    "<S> is considered to be a gaussian noise , such that @xmath11 an electron is subjected to the potential @xmath12 and a hole to @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are constants . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the characteristic length of the random field potential @xmath16 to be much smaller than the average distance between excitons @xmath17 ( @xmath18 , where @xmath8 is the total exciton density ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in order to obtain the green s function of the excitons with dipole - dipole repulsion in the random field , we obtain the green s function of a single exciton in the random field ( not interacting with other excitons ) , and then apply perturbation theory with respect to dipole - dipole repulsion between excitons , using the gas of non - interacting excitons as a reference system .    the momentum - frequency domain green s function of the center of mass of the isolated exciton in the random field at @xmath19 within the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) is given by@xcite ( here and below @xmath20 ) @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the chemical potential of the system , and @xmath23 is the spectrum of the center mass of the exciton in the `` clean '' system ( @xmath24 is the mass of the exciton ; @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the electron and hole masses , correspondingly ) . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath27 is determined by the effective random field acting on the center of mass of the exciton . </S>",
    "<S> for zero random field , @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath29 ( @xmath30 is the binding energy of an exciton ) , the function @xmath27 in the second - order born approximation can be expressed through the ground - state wavefunction of an indirect exciton . </S>",
    "<S> analytical results for @xmath27 may be derived for @xmath31 and @xmath32 or @xmath33 and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> we present in this letter the simplest case @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the result , for the case @xmath31 and @xmath32 , is @xmath35 here @xmath36 , with @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is the dielectric constant of the material , @xmath39 is the reduced mass of exciton , and @xmath40 is the electron charge ) , and @xmath41 is a bessel function of the first kind .    at small densities @xmath8 ( @xmath42 ) , the system of indirect excitons at low temperatures is a two - dimensional weakly nonideal bose gas of dipoles with dipole moments @xmath43 normal to wells ( @xmath44 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the distinction between excitons and bosons manifests itself in exchange effects ( see , e.g. , refs . </S>",
    "<S> [ ] , and [ ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these effects are suppressed for excitons with spatially separated @xmath40 and @xmath45 in a dilute system ( @xmath46 ) at large @xmath0 ( @xmath31 ) , because at large @xmath0 , the exchange interaction in the spatially separated system is suppressed relative to the @xmath47 system in a single well due to the smallness of the tunneling exponent @xmath48 $ ] originating from the dipole - dipole interaction . hence , when @xmath31 , exchange phenomena , connected with the distinction between excitons and bosons , can be neglected , and therefore , the system of indirect excitons in cqws can be treated by diagrammatic techniques developed for boson systems@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> two indirect excitons in a dilute system interact as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the distance between exciton dipoles along quantum well planes .    at the characteristic frequencies and momenta which give the greatest contribution to the green s function in the ladder approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath51 can be approximated by the constant ( see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ q_res ] ) ) @xmath52 . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the first order approximation in the amplitude of scattering of the isolated pair of bosons @xmath53 the two - particle vertex @xmath54 can be reduced to @xmath53 pertinent to a clean system@xcite , i.e. @xmath54 does not depend on @xmath55 in the first approximation . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the chemical potential @xmath22 has the same form as for the pure system@xcite : @xmath56 we have the condensate green s function @xmath57 @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the density of bose condensate . since at small temperatures @xmath60 , according to the ladder approximation@xcite we use @xmath8 instead of @xmath59 below . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the normal and anomalous green functions of the overcondensate : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the spectrum of noninteracting excitons ; for small momenta @xmath65 the excitation spectrum of the interacting excitons , @xmath66 , is acoustic : @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the velocity of sound .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the density of the normal component @xmath69 , using the kubo formula@xcite and the total single - particle matsubara green s function of the indirect excitons . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath70 here @xmath71 is the total number of particles , and @xmath72 is the density of the normal component in a pure system with no impurities : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the distribution of an ideal bose gas of temperature excitations .    the first term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nn4 ] ) , which does not depend on @xmath55 , is the contribution to the normal component due to scattering of quasiparticles with an acoustic spectrum in an ordered system at @xmath75 . in a two - dimensional system , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the riemann zeta function ( @xmath78 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nn4 ] ) is the contribution to the normal component due to the interaction of the particles ( excitons ) with the random field , which , when explicitly evaluated , yields : @xmath79 the density of the superfluid component is @xmath80 . from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nn00 ] ) and  ( [ nn55 ] ) we can see that increasing the random field decreases the density of the superfluid component .    in a @xmath6 system , superfluidity appears below the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature @xmath81@xcite , where only coupled vortices are present . using the expressions eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nn00 ] ) and  ( [ nn55 ] ) for the density @xmath82 of the superfluid component , we obtain an equation for the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> its solution is @xmath84 \\frac{t_{c}^{0 } } { 2^{1/3 } }    .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath85 is an auxiliary quantity , equal to the temperature at which the superfluid density vanishes in the mean - field approximation @xmath86 : @xmath87 furthermore , in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tct ] ) and ( [ tct0 ] ) , @xmath88 the dependence of the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature @xmath83 as a function of the total exciton density @xmath8 for different @xmath55 , obtained from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tct ] ) , is presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . it can be seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 that the random field decreases the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature . fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows the dependence of the kts transition temperature on the random field parameter @xmath55 .    </S>",
    "<S> this work shows that although the random field depletes the condensate , kosterlitz - thouless superfluidity should still be possible in a system of spatially indirect excitons . for realistic experimental parameters taken from photoluminescence line broadening measurements@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the disorder energy is approximately @xmath89 mev , which implies @xmath90 in the units of the plots here , which implies a kts transition temperature of @xmath91 k at a density of @xmath92 @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this is still well below the density @xmath93 at which breakdown of the boson picture of excitons can occur , which for a typical electron - hole separation of @xmath94   , i.e. @xmath95 in the units used here , is approximately @xmath96 @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , for larger values of @xmath55 , which corresponds to sample quality of just a few years ago , the critical density can become quite close to this limit . </S>"
