    "in a recent article sassa _ et al . _ presented a soft - x - ray angle - resolved photoemission ( sx - arpes ) study of mgb@xmath0  @xcite , claiming to have established `` the full 3d electronic structure '' of the compound .",
    "the experimental data and the results of band - structure calculations are compared and certain deviations , e.g. , for the band width and fermi - surface area are reported . however , the illustrations used to circumstantiate the article s quantitative claims seem to be mutually inconsistent . in the following , firstly these inconsistencies will be described in detail ( but not necessarily in any hierarchical order ) . secondly , their influence on the conclusions of ref",
    "is discussed .",
    "the main figure ( fig .  5  @xcite ) involved in the band - structure analysis contains a set of particular oddities .",
    "all the _ calculated _ bands depicted in figs .",
    "5(a ) and  5(c ) ought to be symmetric about @xmath1 and @xmath2evidently , some are not : in fig .",
    "5(a ) the @xmath3 band from @xmath4 to @xmath1 is farther away from @xmath1 than the @xmath3 band beyond @xmath1 , leading to differences in the crossing points with the @xmath5 bands ( @xmath6  ev vs. @xmath7  ev and @xmath8  ev vs. @xmath9  ev ) . in fig .",
    "5(c ) the second @xmath3 band and the third @xmath5 band ( always counting at @xmath2 from low to high binding energy @xmath10 ) are shifted significantly toward @xmath11 .",
    "the top of both bands is found at about @xmath12 instead of @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "hence , also the crossings of the second @xmath3 and second @xmath5 bands are not at a constant @xmath10 ( @xmath14  ev vs. @xmath15  ev ) .",
    "apparently , this is _ not _ an effect of inaccuracies of the calculations , otherwise , the second band shown in the zoom - in fig .",
    "5(g ) would not be centered at @xmath2 , either .    staying with fig .  5 and reviewing the energy - distribution - curve ( edc ) analysis reveals several inconsistencies between the presentations in the various subfigures . according to the text in ref .",
    ", the edcs are analyzed using `` resolution broadened lorentzian functions '' .",
    "following the same route , here , edcs around @xmath1 obtained from the grayscale map in fig .",
    "5(a ) and the ( assumed equally spaced ) edcs in fig .",
    "5(f ) are modeled with a pair of voigtians [ gaussian - broadened ( @xmath16  ev ) lorentzians ] residing on a polynomial background [ either parametrized from fig .",
    "5(f ) or fitted ] .",
    "two fits are performed for each set of data : using a @xmath10 fitting range between @xmath17  ev and @xmath18  ev firstly the curves are modeled with two lorentzian widths that are shared by all edcs and secondly the fit is repeated with two independent lorentzian widths for each edc .",
    "both procedures yield fits that are comparable to those shown in fig .",
    "5(f ) . in the first case the obtained lorentzian half - widths at half maximum ( hwhm ) are @xmath19  ev and @xmath20  ev , respectively . in the second case , the hwhm range from @xmath21  ev ( with small corresponding amplitudes ) to @xmath19  ev and from @xmath22  ev to @xmath23  ev , respectively .",
    "the obtained edc peak positions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : edcpeaks ] and compared to the peak positions marked in fig .",
    "if the presentation was consistent throughout fig .  5 , the curves sampled by the peak positions shown in the three upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : edcpeaks ] would coincide .",
    "what is observed instead is that the presentation in fig .",
    "5(f ) is shifted in energy by about @xmath24  ev with respect to the data in figs .",
    "5(a ) as well as  5(h ) and that it features erroneous labeling ; the top - most edc in fig .",
    "5(f ) appears to be rather at @xmath25 or @xmath26 [ if the same decreasing @xmath27not @xmath28as in fig .",
    "5(e ) is used for higher up edcs ] .",
    "in addition , while the band gap for the analysis of the data presented in figs .",
    "5(a ) and  5(f ) is consistently sized about @xmath20  ev to @xmath29  ev , the purported peak positions shown in fig .",
    "5(h ) yield a gap of @xmath30  ev only",
    ". moreover , both gap labels in fig .",
    "5(h ) seem to be inadequate : to be consistent with the points shown in this subfigure as well as the number given in the main text ( ignoring for the moment the variance with the other subfigures ) the `` experimental gap '' should equal @xmath30  ev ; the gap between the calculated curves is @xmath19  ev also at the @xmath1 point . however , taking into account all available information , the experimental gap at @xmath1 seems more likely to have a size of about @xmath20  ev to @xmath29  ev  thus being larger than calculated and at major variance with the peak positions depicted in fig .",
    "an analogous analysis for the data close to @xmath2 presented in figs .",
    "5(c ) , 5(e ) , and  5(g ) yields an overall much more consistent picture as shown in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : edcpeaks ] . also here , a comparably small shift in energy of about @xmath31  ev might be present between the data in fig .",
    "5(c ) and the other two subfigures , yet , the overall dispersions and gap sizes match rather well as they should .",

    "5(a ) and  5(f ) and the corresponding positions depicted in fig .",
    "_ lower panels _ :",
    "peak positions from two - peak edc fits to the data around the @xmath2 point in figs .",
    "5(c ) and  5(e ) and the corresponding positions depicted in fig .",
    "filled and open symbols are for fits using coupled and individual lorentzian widths for the edcs .",
    "the central panels assume an equidistant spacing of the edcs based on the labels given in the figs .",
    "5(f ) and  5(e ) .",
    "the dotted curves represent parabolic fits to the peak positions in the left - most panels at @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "they are reproduced in the middle and right panels to facilitate a better comparison between the different presentations . ]    the calculated band structure along the @xmath4-@xmath32-@xmath1 high - symmetry line is shown twice in ref .",
    ": once in fig .",
    "5(b ) and as well in the left panel of fig .  4 .",
    "naturally , both presentations are expected to show identical results .",
    "however , when plotted together in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparegkmplots ] , it is evident that there are nonnegligible differences between the two presentations .",
    "the deviations in the depicted band positions partially reach up to @xmath30  ev or more than @xmath33 .    the data in fig .  5",
    "is also used to compare variations in the band width between the experiment and the calculation .",
    "for instance , `` ( f)or the @xmath5 bands , the calculation gives a width that is @xmath34 smaller in the @xmath11-@xmath2 than in the @xmath4-@xmath1 direction .",
    "the experiment , however , shows the same bandwidth for both of these direction(s ) ( ... ) ''  @xcite .",
    "again , using the data from figs .",
    "5(a ) and  5(c ) it is possible to estimate the bottom of the first two @xmath5 bands and thus their band width .",
    "the bottom of the first @xmath5 band is at @xmath35  ev at @xmath1 and at @xmath36  ev at @xmath2 , the bottom of the second @xmath5 band is at @xmath37  ev at @xmath1 and at @xmath38  ev at @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the _ experimental _ @xmath5 band width is reduced by @xmath39 to @xmath40 for @xmath11-@xmath2 compared to @xmath4-@xmath1 . furthermore , using the results of the _ calculations _ shown in the same figures , one finds the bottom of the first @xmath5 band at @xmath41  ev at @xmath1 and at @xmath42  ev at @xmath2 .",
    "the bottom of the second @xmath5 band is at @xmath43  ev at @xmath1 and at @xmath44  ev at @xmath2 .",
    "hence , the presented calculation actually suggests a reduction of the band width by @xmath45 to @xmath46 for @xmath11-@xmath2 compared to @xmath4-@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the experiment seems to be in full qualitative agreement with the shown calculations . yet , neither the supposed observed equal experimental band width nor the expected @xmath34 band - width reduction quoted above can be deduced from the figures .",
    "another contestable practice used in figs .",
    "5 and  3 is the disregard of @xmath47 variations for constant photon energies when @xmath48 becomes comparably large , despite quoting eq .",
    "( 1 ) in ref .  .",
    "for instance , in the used photon - energy range in the vicinity of the fermi energy @xmath47 changes by almost @xmath49 when increasing @xmath48 from @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "this implies that some caution is in order when comparing constant - photon - energy measurements with constant-@xmath47 calculations , even more so if bands with strong @xmath47 dispersion like the @xmath52 bands of mgb@xmath0 are studied .",
    "despite the claim of ref .   to have revealed the `` complete 2d and 3d electronic band structure of mgb@xmath0 '' , with the exception of parts of the fermi surface and bands at two distinct @xmath47 points , _ no _ out - of - plane dispersion has been presented .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to assess quantitatively the effects of the @xmath47 variations on the measured band structure within the calculations of ref .  .",
    "however , as evident from the calculated fermi surface , expected qualitative effects include , e.g. , the diminishing of the @xmath2 electron band close to the fermi energy in fig .",
    "5(c ) and the corresponding growth of the `` @xmath3 fermi hexagons '' in fig .",
    "3(b ) when @xmath47 is moving away from @xmath53 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     focusing now on the @xmath47-dependent cuts through the fermi surface shown in figs .",
    "2(a ) through  2(e ) , also here , inconsistencies in the presentation are found .",
    "figures  2(d ) and  2(e ) feature common @xmath47 tic marks and both cuts and include the @xmath1-@xmath2 line .",
    "hence , the intersections of this line with the _ calculated _ fermi surface parts should be identical in figs .",
    "2(d ) and  2(e ) .",
    "surprisingly , they are not . going from high @xmath47 to low @xmath47 , the corresponding @xmath54 values are @xmath55 vs. @xmath56 , @xmath57 vs. @xmath58 , @xmath59 vs. @xmath60 , @xmath61 vs. @xmath62 , @xmath63 vs. @xmath64 , @xmath65 vs. @xmath65 , @xmath66 vs. @xmath67 , and @xmath68 vs. @xmath69 . moreover , the shown curves are overall not symmetric about the @xmath47 integer multiples of @xmath70 .",
    "maybe most prominently , this is seen at the orange curve off - centered from @xmath71 in fig .",
    "2(e ) as well as the cross section of the warped @xmath5 fermi - surface cylinders in fig .",
    "2(d ) which are not `` narrowest at @xmath4 '' as stated in the text of ref .",
    ".    since the presentations of the calculated bands in fig .  5 as well as the fermi surface in figs .",
    "2(d ) and  2(e ) contain apparent inconsistencies as detailed above , the overall positions of the in - plane components of the _ calculated _ fermi crystal momenta along different high - symmetry lines throughout the various illustrations in ref .",
    "are compared in table  [ tab : pos_fs ] .",
    "deviations of partially more than @xmath72 can be observed between the different figures .",
    "further inconsistencies can be found in figs .",
    "2(a ) through  2(e ) .",
    "illustrated in fig .",
    "2(a ) and consistent with the labels in figs .  2(d ) and  2(e ) , cuts and lie in the @xmath27-@xmath47 and @xmath28-@xmath47 planes , respectively .",
    "contrarily , it is stated in the figure caption that both cuts cover the @xmath27-@xmath47 plane . moreover , the introduction of ref .",
    "advertises that for reporting the experimental results `` data enhancement ( was ) not needed '' .",
    "this is at variance with the apparent but not indicated symmetrized presentation of experimental data in figs .",
    "2(b ) and  2(c ) .",
    "it might also be worth noting that the part of the fermi surface around @xmath2 which is deemed `` not visible '' is indeed present in the data  only due to an erroneous symmetrization of the data vanishing in cut , but nevertheless constituting the strongest signal in cut .",
    "a detailed account of the effects of the apparent data treatment in figs .",
    "2 and  3 can be found in the appendix .    finally , a few minor issues in the experimental description of ref .",
    "are identified .",
    "it has been mentioned that `` by scanning the photon energy ( @xmath73 ) at fixed binding energy @xmath10 and emission angle '' one could scan , e.g. , along @xmath74 . due to the finite momentum transfer from the incident photons",
    "this is not strictly the case : @xmath74 does not correspond to electrons emitted normally to the sample surface and the emission angle changes continuously with the photon energy / momentum . also , the correction term taking into account the photon momentum transfer for the calculation of @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) lacks a division by @xmath75 . eventually , while the angle between the analyzer axis and the incident photon beam is @xmath76 at the adress sx - arpes end station , the angle used in eq .",
    "( 1 ) ought to be the one between the inclined analyzer axis and the laboratory normal ( @xmath77 )  @xcite .",
    "having identified a multitude of inconsistencies in the presentation of the results , an important question is how these impact the analysis and conclusions of ref .  .",
    "this question should be addressed in two parts : firstly , ref .",
    "establishes experimentally the topology of the 3d fermi - surface as well as of the _ in - plane _ dispersion of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "the observed features are qualitatively well reproduced by calculations in the literature ( cf . ,",
    "e.g. , references within ref .  ) .",
    "while some of the presentations of experimental data are indeed questionable ( see appendix ) , the apparent flaws described above do not affect this qualitative result . the second part of the question concerns if the detailed quantitative comparisons between the arpes data and the presented calculations still hold despite the inconsistencies within and across the different illustrations . to answer that a few concrete examples shall be discussed in the following .",
    "ref .   has a particular emphasis on deviations of the @xmath52 calculations from the measured bands .",
    "for instance , `` ( a)t @xmath2 , the measured electron pocket has a smaller fs cross section ( by @xmath78 ) than what is estimated by ( the ) calculation [ fig .",
    "(  ) to correct for this , the calculated antibonding @xmath79 band would have to be shifted by approximately @xmath80  mev toward @xmath81 . ''",
    "this is at substantial variance with the fermi surface shown in fig .",
    "2(d ) ( cf .",
    "@xmath82 and @xmath83 in table  [ tab : pos_fs ] ) . to reproduce the values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 in fig .",
    "2(d ) , this very band would have to be shifted by @xmath84  ev toward @xmath85multiple times more than the deviation discussed here .",
    "although in fact this correction seems unlikely and would probably be at variance with the @xmath47 dispersion of the band , it nonetheless illustrates the order of magnitude of the observed inconsistencies in ref .   and thus a substantial uncertainty introduced by them .",
    "next , `` ( f)or the @xmath3 bands , the measured width for the band dispersing from @xmath2 to @xmath86 to @xmath11 [ fig .",
    "5(d ) ] is @xmath87@xmath88  % larger than the calculated one ''  @xcite . without taking into account",
    "the argument just made and assuming the illustration in fig .",
    "5(d ) represents the valid result of the calculation for @xmath89 , the consequences of the @xmath47 variation with changing @xmath28 in the data can be estimated . as mentioned above , ref .",
    "does not provide out - of - plane dispersions .",
    "therefore , calculations of ref .   for the @xmath2-@xmath1 direction are used for an estimate . according to eq .",
    "( 1 ) @xmath47 varies by about @xmath90 between @xmath2 ( @xmath91 ) and @xmath11 ( @xmath92 ) for @xmath93  ev and energies close to the fermi energy . moving @xmath90 away from @xmath2 toward @xmath1 ,",
    "changes the topmost occupied energy level by about @xmath30  ev toward @xmath94  @xcite which corresponds to about @xmath95  % of the band width .",
    "hence , the deviation reported in ref .",
    "is potentially overestimated by about a factor of @xmath96 .    already in the previous section the comparison of the @xmath5 band width between @xmath11-@xmath2 and @xmath4-@xmath1 as seen in figs .",
    "5(a ) and  5(c ) has been discussed in detail .",
    "it is emphasized once more that neither the supposed observed equal experimental band width along these directions nor the expected @xmath34 band - width reduction for @xmath11-@xmath2 compared to @xmath4-@xmath1 quoted in ref .",
    "can be deduced from the figures .",
    "the detailed analysis presented around fig .",
    "[ fig : edcpeaks ] suggests that contrary to the claim of ref .",
    "the band gap at @xmath1 at high binding energies is most likely not smaller than calculated , but rather has a similar size than the deduced band gap at @xmath2 and thus is somewhat larger than predicted .",
    "it is also worth noting here , that this band gap is expected to have a negligible @xmath47 dependence  @xcite , which  in contrast to the findings of ref .",
    "is nicely confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig : edcpeaks ] .    in connection with figs .",
    "5(g ) and  5(h ) it is also pointed out in ref .   that `` a shift of the calculated band(s ) edges by approximately @xmath19 ev is needed in order to fit the data (  ) '' .",
    "given the uncertainty of the calculations arising from the comparison of the calculated band structures depicted in figs .",
    "5(b ) and 4 , the relevant energy levels at @xmath1 might be shifted up to @xmath30  ev to lower binding energies , thus increasing the postulated deviation by @xmath97 to about @xmath29  ev ( keeping the originally marked peak positions as reference ) .",
    "statements like `` the @xmath5 band width ` is @xmath98@xmath96  % wider than the calculated one along @xmath4-@xmath1 '  @xcite '' depend on a very high degree of accuracy in the calculations .",
    "the uncertainty originating from fig .",
    "[ fig : comparegkmplots]which easily amounts up to @xmath99  % of the band width  renders such conclusions not reliable .",
    "eventually , the host of significant variations in the calculated fermi crystal momenta summarized in table  [ tab : pos_fs ] as well as the overall uncertainty in the presented band calculations discussed in the preceding examples most likely preclude a meaningful detailed quantitative comparison between the experimental data and the calculations .",
    "therefore , also the comparison of the conclusions obtained in ref .   with previous de haas ",
    "van alphen fermi - surface measurements has to be seen overall critically .",
    "taking into account all the effects discussed above , it is concluded that the results of the quantitative analysis in ref .",
    "are indeed substantially influenced by the inconsistencies reported here . with the only exception of the band - gap determination at the @xmath2 point , the quantitative results are found to be questionable or at least subject to major uncertainty which could only be reduced by a fully consistent presentation .",
    "in summary , the article by sassa _ et al . _ in principle provides experimental data of high quality .",
    "some of the corresponding presentations are rather questionable ( see appendix ) but any qualitative arguments regarding the topology of the 3d fermi surface and of the in - plane electronic band structure of mgb@xmath0 appear to be valid . yet , a multitude of inconsistencies in the analysis and/or presentation of the results cast doubt on the reliability of the obtained quantitative conclusions .",
    "moreover , the fundamental claim of the article to have established `` the full 3d electronic structure '' of mgb@xmath0 is found to be somewhat exaggerated .",
    "i thank the staff of the adress beamline at the swiss light source ( paul scherrer institute , villigen , switzerland ) for providing access to the experimental data discussed in the appendix of this comment .",
    "the following free software was particularly useful while preparing this manuscript : debian gnu / linux  @xcite including kde  @xcite , inkscape  @xcite , engauge  @xcite , gnu octave  @xcite , root  @xcite , gnuplot  @xcite , and tex live  @xcite as well as musrfit  @xcite .",
    "this work was supported by the swedish research council .",
    "it has already been mentioned in sec .  [",
    "sec : observations ] that the fermi - surface data shown in ref .",
    "are seemingly symmetrized . to shine some light on this procedure , in the following the illustrations in figs .",
    "2(b ) and  2(c ) as well as in figs .",
    "3(a ) and  3(b ) shall be compared to nonsymmetrized presentations derived from the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "the data analysis performed in this comment merely involves rudimentary data alignment and normalization steps as well as an _ approximate _ mapping to reciprocal space .",
    "slight further angular adjustments would be required for an exact quantitative analysis .",
    "however , this is beyond the scope of the qualitative comparison in this appendix .",
    "first , the experimental fermi surfaces shown in fig .  2 are analyzed .",
    "figure  [ fig : kykz_gk ] compares the ( redrawn ) presentation of fig .",
    "2(c ) [ fig .",

    "[ fig : kykz_gk : b ] ] .",
    "it seems to be clear that only a small part of the experimental data has been used as basis of the illustration in fig .",
    "2(c ) [ dotted rectangle in fig .",
    "[ fig : kykz_gk : b ] ] .",
    "moreover , it is apparent that the symmetrization in fig .",
    "2(c ) is flawed : the data is shifted by @xmath100 in @xmath47 direction , leading to the erroneous conclusion in ref .   that the electron - like `` pocket centered around @xmath2 is not visible [ red dashed line in fig .",
    "2(c ) ] ''  @xcite .",
    "rather , it is a part of the hole - like pocket around @xmath1 which can hardly be observed in this experiment .",

    "2(b ) , where indeed the electron - like fermi - surface around @xmath2 contributes the most intense photoelectron signal .",

    "the small size differences of the electron and hole pockets between figs .",
