    "it is therefore appropriate and timely to devise observational tests that allow us to probe the homogeneity and isotropy assumptions .",
    "we know the isotropy assumption is well supported by detailed observations of the cosmic microwave background , which has shown that temperature variations are only one part in @xmath4 across the sky . however , homogeneity is much more difficult to probe .",
    "homogeneity is not established by observations of the cmb and the galaxy distribution : we can not directly observe homogeneity , since we observe down our past light - cone , recording properties on 2-spheres of constant redshift and not on spatial surfaces that intersect that lightcone .",

    "this implies that tests for homogeneity must be made throughout the history of the universe .",
    "consistency tests which could uncover deviations from homogeneity can be used to probe consistency of observables on our past lightcone @xcite .",
    "testing for the transition to homogeneity in the galaxy distribution on the lightcone , while assuming a friedmann background , is another consistency test @xcite .",

    "a full proof of homogeneity would entail establishing homogeneity of the metric tensor . here",
    "we apply a consistency test to check for violations of homogeneity , using the star formation rate as a probe , following the idea in @xcite .",
    "the fossil record , or the star formation history ( hereafter @xmath6 ) , can be obtained by analysing the shape of the galaxy spectrum , which encodes information about the histories of the component stellar populations , dust , and star formation .",

    "the reason for this is that all stacks have considerably ( almost two orders of magnitude ) more star formation in this time bin than others , and have smaller fractional errors ( see below for the error assignment ) .",
