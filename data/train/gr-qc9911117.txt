    "taking the yang - mills model as the matter part of the equations of einstein , one finds a rich spectrum of stationary regular and non - regular solutions .",
    "this in contrast with the vacuum solution and einstein - maxwell(em ) solutions , where the schwarzschild respectively the reissner - nordstrm(rn ) solution are the only static black hole solutions . in the einstein - yang - mills(eym )",
    "theory one finds not only the embedding of the abelian rn black hole , but in addition there are genuine non - abelian coloured black holes .",
    "their co - existence gives rise to the violation of the no - hair conjecture , since they carry the same ( magnetic ) charge .",
    "for an overview , see volkov and galtsov  @xcite . after the discovery by bartnik and mckinnon(bmk )  @xcite of these non - abelian particle - like and later the non - rn ( hairy ) black hole solutions of the su(2 ) eym theory  @xcite , throughout instability investigations where done by several authors  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that under spherically symmetric perturbations the bmk solution is unstable .",
    "the nth bmk solution has in fact 2n unstable modes , comparable with the flat space - time sphaleron solution . in the static case",
    ", it was recently conjectured  @xcite that there are hairy black holes in the su(n ) eym - theories with topological instabilities . in order to analyze the stability of the solutions ,",
    "one usually linearized the field equations  @xcite .",
    "we conjectured that the conventional linear analysis is in fact inadequate to be applied to the situation where a singularity is formed  @xcite .",
    "one better can apply the so - called multiple - scale or two - timing method , developed by choquet - bruhat  @xcite .",
    "this method is particularly useful for constructing uniformly valid approximations to solutions of perturbation problems  @xcite . at the threshold of black hole formation",
    "it is found numerically  @xcite that there is a critical parameter whose value separates solutions containing black holes from those which do not . for a critical value one",
    "observes self - similarity : it produces itself ( echoes ) on progressively finer scales ( choptuik - scaling ) .",
    "it is evident that the collapsing ball of field energy will produce gravitational waves , which will be coupled to the ym - field perturbations . due to the accumulation of echoes , the curvature diverges .",
    "close related to this critical behavior is the comparable irregularities which can be found in the einstein - skyrme(es ) model and the einstein - yang - mills - higgs(eymh ) model . in the latter model ,",
    "space - like hypersurfaces develop for a critical value of @xmath2 two distinct regions separated by a long throat , with @xmath3 the ym scale and @xmath4 .",
    "the solutions mentioned above need not be spherically symmetric . since the pioneering work of stachel  @xcite , we know that stationary cylindrical symmetric rotating models possess intriguing features .",
    "first , the evolution of the classical cylindrical gravitational wave - solution in the vacuum situation can be described in terms of two effects : the usual cylindrical reflections and a rotation of the polarization vector of the waves , an effect comparable with the faraday rotation  @xcite .",
    "secondly , the time - dependent solutions can be related to the cosmic - string solution interacting with gravitational waves  @xcite .",
    "usually the cosmic string solution , with its famous conical structure , is found in the u(1)-gauge einstein - higgs system .",
    "it is remarkable that the cylindrical rotating vacuum solution possesses the same conical structure .",
    "moreover , it is asymptotically flat and free of singularities .",
    "the physical interpretation can nicely be formulated using the belinsky - zakharov method of integrating the einstein equations with the help of the ernst potentials  @xcite . using the c - energy description",
    ", one can conclude that the solution represents solitonic gravitational waves interacting with a straight - line cosmic string , where the asymptotic angle deficit depends on the c - energy of the gravitational waves .",
    "when a maxwell field is incorporated , the physical interpretation of the solutions is not easily formulated .",
    "it is hard to believe that in the electrovac solution the electro - magnetic waves do not contribute to the angle deficit  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the mass per unit length of the cosmic string , which is a constant in the xanthopoulos solution , will be determined by the energy - momentum tensor of the non - vacuum situation . in stead of electrifying or magnetifying the vacuum solutions via the ernst formulation",
    ", one can better consider the coupled system of einstein equations and matter field equations .",
    "here we consider the einstein - yang - mills system on a cylindrical symmetric rotating space - time .",
    "this situation con formally be obtained from the axially symmetric situation by complex substitution of @xmath5  @xcite . in the non - rotating cylindrically symmetric situation , it was numerically found  @xcite that the singular behavior at finite distance of the core as found in the supermassive situation , will be pushed to infinity for some critical values of the gauge coupling constant and one of the ym components .",
    "we will use a ( 2 + 1)+1 reduction scheme  @xcite in order to obtain the suitable parameterization for the yang - mills potential .",
    "in fact one replaces the ym field by a 2d abelian one - form , a 2d kaluza - klein two - form , a 2d matrix - valued scalar and a 3d higgs field  @xcite .    in the abelian counterpart model",
    "it is known that the space - time around ( spinning ) gauge strings could have , besides the usual angle deficit feature , exotic properties , such as the violation of causality  @xcite , time - delay effects  @xcite , helical structure of time  @xcite and frame - dragging  @xcite .",
    "a class of approximate solutions of the coupled einstein - scalar - gauge field equations on the ( @xmath6)-plane of an axially symmetric space - time was found  @xcite .",
    "so a question addressed in this paper will be whether the string features will be maintained in the eym system . in the general @xmath7-dependent situation , a nice overview was given by islam  @xcite .",
    "one can proof via the ernst formulation that for any solution of the stationary einstein equations one can generate a corresponding solution of the em equations .",
    "in fact , one introduces two complex potentials , for which one finds two second - order elliptic differential equations . starting with the kerr solution",
    ", it is possible to use this correspondence to find a solution of the em equations leading to the kerr - newman solution .",
    "this ernst - route fails in the eym system , simply by the fact that one of the metric components does not decouple from the other ones .",
    "it is also known that the electrovac staticity theorem  @xcite does not generalize to the eym system .",
    "in fact , spinning eym systems must be electrically charged .",
    "so another question addressed in this paper is whether electrically and magnetically charged solution will exist in the eym system .",
    "finally , this is not the complete story : the investigations can be extended to the model where the interior solution is properly matched onto the exterior solution of the string  @xcite .",
    "this is currently under study by the author .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we derive the field equation on an cylindrical symmetric space time . in sec .",
    "iii we present the numerical solution . in section",
    "iv we present a approximate solution using the multiple - scale method and in sec .",
    "v we summarize and analyse our results .",
    "consider the lagrangian of the su(2 ) eym system @xmath8,\\ ] ] with the ym field strength @xmath9 g the gauge coupling constant , g newton s constant , @xmath10 the gauge potential , and @xmath11 the curvature scalar .",
    "the field equations then become @xmath12 @xmath13 with @xmath14 the energy - momentum tensor @xmath15 and @xmath16 the gauge - covariant derivative , @xmath17 let us consider the cylindrical space time @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are functions of t and r. the problem is , which ansatz one needs for the ym field . it is often argued that einsteins gravity on a three dimensional space time shows some similarity with chern simons theory with the poincar group being the underlying gauge group .",
    "so when trying to find the dimensional reduction for the stationary axially symmetric eym system , one can be guided by the results found by using the ( 2 + 1)+1 reduction scheme suggested by maeda , sasaki , nakamura and miyama  @xcite , and later worked out by galtsov  @xcite .",
    "one writes in general @xmath21 where @xmath22 an one - form , generating a field strength @xmath23 .",

    "in the vacuum situation , the behavior of the cylindrical wave solution is well established  @xcite .",
    "one can have reflection of incoming into outgoing waves with the same polarization .",
    "further , there is a non - linear effect describing the interaction between the two different polarization @xmath56 and @xmath57 modes .",
    "if an outgoing cylindrical wave is linear polarized , its polarization vector rotates as it propagates . this effect",
    "is often called faraday rotation and is given by @xmath58 with @xmath59    a wave emitted from the axis of symmetry behaves like a shock front and is given by @xmath60 with @xmath61 and a and b arbitrary constants .",
    "one can generate a two - soliton solution and it is found that near the axis @xmath62 , which also describes the c - energy , does not approach zero .",
    "so some matter field must act as a possible source of the two - soliton field .",
    "this curious conclusion can also be formulated in context of the cosmic string with mass unit length @xmath63 , with p a constant originating from the static solution @xmath64 , which on his turn is related to the angle deficit of the string , given by @xmath65 when a rosen-pulse @xmath66 is emitted , @xmath62 changes by an amount @xmath67 , where k depends solely on @xmath68 .",
    "so after the pulse , one has a different string , which let marder  @xcite to conclude that the mass per unit length has decreased by an amount @xmath69 .",
    "because @xmath70 is related to the c-energy , this confirms that the waves carry away energy and are evidently generated by a source on the axis .",
    "so a continuous change in the parameter p may produce suddenly and inexplicable change in physical meaning .",
    "further , it was emphasized in the vacuum case that there is a reflection of the outgoing wave into an ingoing wave and visa versa .    from the einstein - maxwell case",
    "@xcite it is known that there exist stable open cosmic strings coupled with gravity and electromagnetism .",
    "when gravitational and electromagnetic waves are generated , the angle deficit is increased asymptotically and near the axis independent of the coupling of the maxwell field to gravity .",
    "further , it was emphasized that the electromagnetic waves do contribute to the rotation of the spacetime by effecting the dragging of the killing field @xmath71 , but not to the angle deficit .    in our eym case we solved eq.(17)-(22 ) for the initial values @xmath72 for @xmath42 we will take as initial value a node number 1 or node number 2 function , i.e. , @xmath73 , or @xmath74",
    ". here are @xmath75 some constants .",
    "we used a 100x100 grid and applied the method of lines with cubic hermite polynomials .",
    "the roundoff error remained below 0.001 . in figure 1 we took @xmath76 and for @xmath42 the node number 2 function .",
    "we plotted respectively : @xmath77 , f , @xmath78 , @xmath45 , @xmath42 , @xmath46 , the angle deficit , the gravitational puls wave @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 . in figure 2",
    "we took a different initial @xmath77 ( p=0.1 in stead of 0.25 ) .",
    "we obtain a solitonlike solution .",
    "the behavior depends on the initial mass per unit length of the string , just as in the vacuum case . in figure 3",
    "we took the node number 1 function for @xmath42 .",
    "we observe that the angle deficit changes significantly as well as the gravitational outgoing pulse .",
    "so the yang - mills waves has an impact on the gravitational waves . in figure 4 we took p=0.1 in stead of p=0.25 .",
    "we see that the behavior of the solution changes significantly : the angle deficit close to the r - axis increases , while the gravitational puls hangs close to the r - axes .",
    "in figure 5 we plotted a long - time run for a different initial @xmath78 : an outgoing wave is reflected into an ingoing wave .",
    "an important question is if the solution admits gauge - charges .",
    "the gauge - charges @xmath82 ( electric and magnetic ) are given by    @xmath83    with f the ym field strength , @xmath84 the dual tensor and the integration over a two - sphere at spatial infinity .",
    "in our situation , we obtain for the charges @xmath85\\tau_r + \\bigl[\\partial_t(w_2+\\omega\\phi_2 ) -ga_2(w_1+\\omega\\phi_1)\\bigr]\\tau_z\\bigr\\}dr\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath86 \\cr + \\bigl[\\frac{1}{f}(\\partial_r\\phi_2-ga_1\\phi_1)-\\frac{f\\omega}{r^2}(\\partial_rw_2+\\phi_2\\partial_r\\omega - ga_1w_1)\\bigr]\\tau_z)\\bigr\\}dr,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used eq .",
    "so in general the solution will possess gauge charges .",
    "in the appendix we presented the multiple - scale method for the eym system . on the metric eq . ( 7 ) we have for the tetrad component : @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which implies that the divergence of the null congruence @xmath89 becomes @xmath90 as it should be . from eq .",

    "@xmath114 we use eq.(a13 ) .",
    "the resulting equations are similar to the equations found in section 2 for @xmath95 . from eq .",
    "( a17 ) we obtain equations for the background variables @xmath115 , and @xmath116 with back - reaction terms , for example , @xmath117d\\xi + \\frac{8\\pi g\\bar\\omega}{\\bar fr^2\\tau}\\int\\bigl[\\bar f^2(\\dot w_1^{(1)}+\\bar\\phi_1 \\dot\\omega^{(1)})^2+r^2(\\dot\\phi_1^{(1)})^2+\\bar f^2(\\dot w_2^{(1)})^2\\bigr]d\\xi \\cr + \\frac{4\\pi g\\bar\\omega \\bar f}{r^2}\\bigl[(\\partial_t\\bar w_1+\\bar\\phi_1\\partial_t\\bar\\omega)^2 + ( \\partial_r\\bar w_1+\\bar\\phi_1\\partial_r\\bar\\omega)^2+\\frac{r^2}{\\bar f^2 } ( \\partial_r\\bar\\phi_1 ^ 2+\\partial_t\\bar\\phi_1 ^ 2)\\bigr].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    so we see that a first order hf gravitational and yang - mills wave emitted from the string , will change the metric background component @xmath118 , just as in the vacuum situation for pure gravitational waves .",
    "moreover , there will be a distortion of the shape of the wave during its propagation , which does not occur in the pure einstein case .",
    "in general , this is due to the fact that second order terms appear in the perturbation equations of @xmath107 and @xmath119 .",
    "now let us consider , for example , the equation for @xmath99 , eq .",
    "( 36 ) . for @xmath120",
    ", we can solve @xmath99 for @xmath121 .",
    "for example for @xmath122 we have @xmath123 which approaches to zero for large r. here is @xmath124 an arbitrary function of @xmath125 . together with eq.(31 )",
    "we then have to first order @xmath126 which is bounded for large r. one can proceed in the same way for the other first order perturbations by imposing some trial solutions for the background variables  @xcite",
    "non - abelian gravity - coupled solitons and black holes could have played an important role in gauge theories of elementary particles in the early stage of the universe . besides the well - known spherically symmetric solutions , axially symmetric solutions are of interest due to the fact that they admit cosmic strings , which could have played the role of seeds for the large - scale structure of clusters in the universe .",
    "it is quite evident that the solution found here is a radiating one and there is an interaction of the solitonlike gravitational waves and the yang - mills waves with the rotating string .",
    "this can be seen from figure 5 where the angle deficit and @xmath77 is significantly changed by the pulses .",
    "this can also be seen from eq .",
    "( 41 ) , where the term on the right - hand side represents the back - reaction of the waves on @xmath77 .",
    "the wave - like solutions found in this model is significantly different from the electrovac solution found in the einstein - maxwell model .",
    "the intervening electro - magnetic waves did not contribute to the angle deficit asymptotically , while in our model the magnetic components @xmath127 has an impact on the angle deficit for large r ( compare figures 1 and 3 ) . in particularly the number of times",
    "the @xmath127 crosses the r - axis influences the gravitational wave puls .",
    "further , for a different mass per unit length of the string , a different behavior of the solution is obtained ( compare figures 3 and 4 ) .    in order to conclude if the solution is topological stable , we must solve the perturbation equations to higher order .",
    "moreover , a combination of the results of a throughout numerical investigation with the multiple - scale method pushed to higher orders , will lead to further understanding of the rich structure of the eym system on a rotating space time .",
    "specially the question if a electrically and magnetically charged solution ( dyon ) of the rotating cosmic string exists .",
    "further , bursts of high - frequency gravitational waves might be detectable by the planned gravitational wave detectors ligo / virgo and lisa , even for strings at gut scale  @xcite .",
