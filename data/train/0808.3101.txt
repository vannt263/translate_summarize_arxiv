    "lattice calculations aim at a quantitative analysis of the qcd phase diagram , using the qcd lagrangian as a sole input .",

    "a critical point in the t,@xmath1 plane has been predicted by model calculations , and several lattice studies have searched for it , without finding a general agreement , see e.g. @xcite for a review . in ref.@xcite",
    "an alternative strategy was proposed , based on the analysis of the slope @xmath2 of the critical surfaces in the @xmath3 space stemming from the critical line which limits the first order transition area of the @xmath4 plane : @xmath5 a positive slope would be indicative of a critical endpoint .",

    "but for isospin baryochemical potential , give @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "close to the zero density critical temperature the difference between effects produced by baryochemical potential and isospin chemical potential is small ( for instance , large @xmath9 calculation predict differences @xmath10 @xcite ) , so the two results @xcite consistently suggest that the region of first order phase transition becomes smaller at nozero chemical potential , at least till @xmath11 mev .",
    "a mean field calculation carried out in the @xmath12 njl model shows instead the opposite trend@xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : njl ] , right . all in all we are observing qualitative differences between qcd and purely fermionic models at small chemical potential .",
    "indeed chiral symmetry is most likely broken by long distance forces in qcd , and by short distance vector forces in njl , and these differences might well have an impact on the existence of the critical endpoint , see also ref . @xcite .",
    "the results @xcite have been obtained on lattices with @xmath13 .",
    "it would be very important to confirm these predictions closer to the continuum limit .",
    "indeed , the relevance of taking the continuum limit can be hardly overemphasised in qcd @xcite",
    ".    one substantial step towards the continuum limit of the critical line has been presented at this meeting @xcite .",
    "the slope of the critical line has been computed for @xmath14 , and the claim is that there is a reasonable control over the @xmath15 extrapolation , see fig.3 .",
    "note that while the ( pseudo)critical temperatures at @xmath16 estimated from the peak of the polyakov loop susceptibility differs from the one estimated from the peak of the chiral susceptibility , the slope of the two lines are the same within errorbars .",

    "it is was established already at the time of qm2006 that the hadron resonance gas model , where @xmath20 describes well the system up to rather high temperatures @xmath21 @xcite .    for zero chemical potential ,",
    "new results for the susceptibilites have been presented by the rbc - bielefeld collaboration@xcite .",

    "5 . note that the simple polynomial behaviour of the free field limit would be recovered when @xmath27 , and that @xmath28 , resulting from the numerical analysis , implies a slower increase of the particle number in the critical region with respect to the free case .",
    "it would be interesting to repeat this investigation using the generalised method of ref.@xcite .",
    "data at imaginary chemical potential are amenable to an easy comparison with analytic studies , and indeed the results in the strongly interactive region compares favourably with a quasiparticle study@xcite , once an explicit dependence of the self - energy parts on @xmath29 and @xmath30 , as well as an implicit dependence via the effective coupling @xmath31 has been taken into account : @xmath32 at larger temperature the data should compare successfully with a resummed perturbation theory @xcite , and it remains to be seen which is the lower limit of its applicability .",
    "while the results of the two previous sections are robust , and we believe they can be systematically improved much in the same way as standard lattice qcd calculations , in this colder , denser region the sign problem becomes more severe and the results should still be considered exploratory @xcite .",
    "the mass spectrum has been computed via the qcd strong coupling expansion , observing the expected signatures of chiral symmetry restoration , and a @xmath33 mass decreasing with temperature@xcite .",

    "the density of states method - a reordering of the functional integral based on the costrained partition function ( which in condensed matter parlance might be called a mesoscopic approach ) -    @xmath39    applied to the @xmath40 theory allowed the identification of two phase transition lines , and gave indication of a triple point @xcite ( fig.7 , left ) .",

    "the onset for thermodynamics equals , as usual , the mass of the lowest excitation carrying the relevant charge , i.e. @xmath42 in the case of isospin density , and @xmath43 , for two- color qcd , so the physics of a finite density of isospin , and of finite baryon density have many analogies .",

    "results from ongoing work@xcite indicate that a bec / bcs transition persists at a finer lattice spacing . at the hadronic / bec interface",
