    "observations show that the cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) has declined by more than an order of magnitude since @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , a combined census of the cold gas , the fuel for star formation , and stellar components is still largely missing in observations .",
    "the cold gas fraction of a halo is a crucial ingredient in models of galaxy formation and constitutes the link to how galaxies obtain gas and subsequently convert it to stars .",
    "hence , measurements of hi in the post - reionization era can place tight constraints on different models of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "after the epoch of reionization , the neutral hydrogen ( hi ) survives in dense clouds , e.g.  damped lyman-@xmath6 systems ( dlas ) and lyman - limit systems ( lls ) , that are high - redshift equivalents of the hi - rich galaxies that we see at the present epoch .",
    "the baryon fraction locked up in hi , @xmath7 , in star - forming galaxies in the post - reionization epoch can be determined from the study of damped lyman-@xmath6 systems in absorption for @xmath8 .",
    "even though these observations give clues about aggregate behaviour of star formation as a function of redshift , they can not be used to infer the total hi mass of these systems because they are seen in absorption . at @xmath9 , even the detection of hi in damped lyman-@xmath6",
    "has not been easy as the lyman-@xmath6 frequency is not accessible to ground - based telescopes . at this redshift , constraints on the global hi fraction",
    "come from associated @xmath10 systems , hst observations ( for details see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and the absorption of 21  cm radiation from bright background radio sources @xcite , but with significant uncertainties on the estimated hi fraction",
    ". direct observation of hi in emission and its detailed modelling has only been possible at @xmath11 thus far @xcite .    direct observation in 21 cm emission of ten massive galaxies have been reported for @xmath12 , with the arecibo telescope @xcite . at higher redshifts ,",
    "the hi emission from individual clouds is too weak to be detectable with present radio instruments @xcite . a long integration time",
    "is required for detecting even the brightest objects since the peak signal is a few tens of micro jansky whereas the system noise is of the order of hundreds of micro jansky . a possible approach to circumvent the difficulty of detecting individual clouds lies in stacking the hi emission of galaxies with known redshifts .",
    "this approach has been attempted for both cluster galaxies and the field galaxies in the recent past @xcite . in particular , a similar line of study has resulted in the recent detection of hi at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach rests on the possible detection of the fluctuation in the redshifted hi emission from high redshifts @xcite .    on the theoretical side",
    ", semi - analytical models of galaxy formation have looked at the evolution of cold gas ( both in atomic and molecular form ) in galaxies and their results match with observations at @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "however observations at higher redshifts are needed to better constrain the evolution of cold gas predicted by these models .",
    "given the importance of connecting cold gas and stars at @xmath0 over a wide range of galaxy environments , it is crucial to make predictions for various detection strategies for current and upcoming telescopes . in this work we focus on the stacking method of individual galaxies with known redshifts to predict",
    "how well the hi mass function at @xmath15 can be constrained with existing surveys and telescopes ( in particular the deep2 survey and the gmrt ; but note that our method is generic and can be extended to future surveys and instruments ) . by stacking",
    "we can also study the contribution of small satellite galaxies , which are undetected in an optical survey but ( as we shall show ) contain non - negligible amounts of hi , to the total @xmath2 signal in emission and also examine the constraints that one can put on the hi mass function .",
    "we model the hi in dark matter halos in a large @xmath16body simulation by refining the model of @xcite .",
    "given the paucity of observations at the redshifts under consideration , and our limited understanding of how hi populates dark matter halos at these redshifts , we consider a variety of models . these are constrained by observations of hi at low redshift , simulations of dlas in small - volumes at high redshift , as well as by some results of semi - analytical models of galaxy formation at intermediate redshifts .",
    "in particular , the models that we consider are consistent with recent observations of hi in emission at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "our paper is organised as follows .",
    "we present our large dark matter simulation in section  [ sec_nbody ] , and describe our model for the hi distribution in the simulation along - with specifications of the deep2 survey as well as the gmrt in section  [ sec_h1model ] .",
    "we discuss our stacking procedure of individual galaxies and the contribution of undetected satellites to the stacked hi spectra in section  [ sec_h1signal ] . in section  [ sec_results ]",
    ", we present our results and discuss the prospects of detection with the gmrt , and the constraints that one can put on the hi mass function .",
    "we revisit the issue of undetected satellites and its effect on the hi mass function and discuss whether their presence can be detected .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in section  [ sec_conclusions ] .",
    ".basic simulation parameters for our dark matter run .",
    "the columns list the size of the simulation box , @xmath17 , the number of dark matter particles used in the simulation , @xmath18 , the mass of a single dark matter particle , @xmath19 , and the gravitational softening length , @xmath20 .",
    "all length scales are in comoving units . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we have studied the prospects for detecting hi in emission at @xmath0 .",
    "this is a crucial epoch in the study of galaxy formation , since the cosmic star formation rate starts to decline around this time and the missing link in observations is an accurate census of cold gas , which fuels star formation , at these redshifts and beyond ( for more discussion of the importance of this issue see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we make a case that an existing instrument like the gmrt can put strong constraints on the amount of cold gas contained in galaxies , when it is combined with a survey like deep2 . in this work ,",
    "we have only focused on the overlapping volume of deep2 and gmrt , which represents a quarter of the total deep2 volume .",
    "our study is representative of what might be achievable by combining the already existing optical data and the presently operational radio interferometers .",
    "the hi signal is too weak in emission for the detection of individual objects at @xmath21 .",
    "however , this can be circumvented by a stacking strategy , similar to @xcite , which we here apply to look at the prospects of detection .",
    "our conclusions are :    * we find that a detection of hi in emission at redshifts of @xmath22 is possible even with existing instruments like the gmrt when combined with the deep2 survey .",
    "such an observation will be able to constrain the hi mass function in the halo mass range @xmath23 .",
    "the detection significance is in the range of @xmath3 for an optimistic noise level of @xmath24jy with 24 hours of integration . * the models that we consider are consistent with recent observations of @xcite , who computed the cross - correlation of the density field of deep2 galaxies and the 21 cm intensity field with the gbt .",
    "however these observations allow for all the three models that we consider .",
    "on the other hand , we find that using the stacking technique it will be possible to discriminate between the different scenarios with an instrument like the gmrt , at least for the optimistic level of noise . * combining our estimates of hi bias with the observations of @xcite",
    ", we find that the most conservative constraint on the cosmic hi fraction at @xmath25 to be @xmath26 .",
    "* we find that undetected satellites in the optical produce a non - negligible contribution to the stacked hi spectra .",
    "their signature is better seen in the stacked spectra rather than in the mass function , since we integrate over one parameter , i.e.  the width of the spectra , to obtain the mass function . for a noise of @xmath27 ,",
    "features of satellites can be seen at the @xmath28 level in the stacked spectra for a mass threshold of @xmath29 .",
    "this detection significance for satellites increases by more than @xmath30 for @xmath31 ( see e.g. fig  [ fig_chisq ] and fig .  [ fig_cummassfn ] ) . in comparison",
    ", the mass function discriminates satellites at the @xmath32 level .",
    "* we have also considered a much higher level of noise , i.e.  @xmath33 , which should represent an upper bound on noise in the gmrt . with this amount of noise ,",
    "a detection of the mass function is possible at the @xmath34 level .",
    "we expect that the real detection significance is bracketed by our the optimistic and conservative noise levels .",
    "* for the higher noise , the effect of satellites on the stacked spectra can be seen only at the @xmath35 level across the ranges of mass that we consider .",
    "the best - fit parameters of the spectra however are incorrect for the larger mass cuts when compared to the theoretical numbers . *",
    "cosmic variance affects the mass function more strongly than the average stacked spectra .",
    "for this reason , if hi is populated in halos according to model 2 one can not quantify the effect of subhalos on the mass function due to the effect of cosmic variance . for models 1 and 3 , cosmic variance does not swamp the errors due to noise .",
    "one can use the stacking strategy to independently probe @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "this is not the case in the cross - correlation approach which constrains @xmath37 . as in @xcite",
    ", it would be useful to also target a subset of galaxies in deep2 whose sfr has been measured .",
    "this would provide the link between the sfr and the amount of cold gas in galaxies and provide insight into models of galaxy formation .",
    "since spectroscopic surveys are accurate but expensive it would be worthwhile to first try this stacking strategy on future surveys like the lsst , which are designed to give photometric redshifts of @xmath38 galaxies .",
    "photometric redshifts are more prone to errors , but it has to be seen if the larger sample of a photo-@xmath39 survey like lsst could beat down the noise by its sheer number of objects .    in this study , we have modelled the hi in all the halos , centrals and satellites , and we have seen how the satellite population affects the hi mass function as well as the stacked hi profile . the possibility to see the effect of satellites missing in an optical survey in the corresponding @xmath2 survey is an exciting prospect .",
    "on the one hand , we find that stacking can distinguish between models , but the effect of satellites on the stacked profile is model dependant , and to see their effect one may need to combine it with the cross - correlation approach . in the cross - correlation method",
    "the optical density field does not contain all the satellites , whereas the hi intensity field does .",
    "if we use the same mass threshold when constructing the hi intensity field , one naively expects a stronger cross - correlation between the two fields .",
    "a preliminary investigation shows that this is indeed the case .",
    "we also expect that the hi bias and stochasticity will be sensitive to subhalos .",
    "a combination of both approaches would shed light on both the model and the contribution of satellites .",
    "the other approach is to observe the auto - correlation function or the power spectrum of hi , and to constrain the hod of hi galaxies @xcite from it .",
    "such an inferred model of hod when combined with a direct detection as is done here could reveal the contribution of the satellite population on the total signal",
    ". we will look into these aspects of the analysis in a forthcoming paper .",
    "currently operational radio instruments  both single dish and interferometers  have the capability to detect hi in emission at @xmath40 , as already demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "we explored the potential of these complementary strategies .",
    "in particular , we studied in detail the efficiency of stacking , possible only with interferometers . in the near future",
    ", we expect larger optical galaxy samples at @xmath9 and radio observations with wider field - of - views and spectral coverage using upcoming radio instruments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this observational progress will enable a better determination of the hi signal using either of the strategies , thereby substantially improving our estimate of the hi content of galaxies at @xmath0 .",
