    "physically , these ir divergences correspond to critical fluctuations that change the universality class from gaussian to that of a three - dimensional scalar o(2)-symmetric field theory .    although it is clear that @xmath4 changes by a small amount if the dimensionless diluteness parameter @xmath0 is small ( for small momenta , @xmath1 is the only relevant parameter of the two - body interaction potential ) , it was for a long time unclear",

    "many attempts on the problem have provided different powers and coefficients @xcite .",
    "recently , however , it has been shown that the leading and next - to - leading behavior is given by @xcite [ deltatexp ] = c_1an^1/3+[c_2(an^1/3)+c_2](an^1/3)^2+in the work presented here , we determine @xmath8 numerically ( while @xmath9 is known exactly , @xmath10 may be determined by a non - perturbative calculation analogous to the one presented here for determining @xmath8 ; for the exact value of @xmath9 and a mc estimate of @xmath10 , see ref .",

    "it was shown that @xmath8 is exclusively generated by infrared fluctuations and that consequently three - dimensional field theory is sufficient for the determination of @xmath8 .",
    "it appears that the most reliable results for @xmath8 before our work have been obtained by monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations in three - dimensional field theory @xcite .",
    "here we expand @xmath13 in a perturbative series , which is subsequently resummed to obtain the physical non - perturbative limit . while simple schemes such as pad approximants may slowly converge towards the correct value ,",
    "our scheme of choice is kleinert s field theoretic variational perturbation theory ( vpt , see @xcite and chapters 5 and 19 of the textbooks @xcite and @xcite , respectively ; improving perturbation theory ( pt ) by a variational principle goes back at least to @xcite ) , which has proven very useful for the investigation of critical phenomena .",

    "it also assumes that three- and more particle interactions are rare , i.e.  that the gas is dilute .",
    "it turns out that the leading perturbative contribution to @xmath13 is @xmath18 . in consequence ,",
    "the leading contribution to @xmath13 arises exclusively from terms that are infrared divergent in the framework of pt .",
    "this is why , for the determination of @xmath8 , we can set all matsubara frequencies to zero or , equivalently , work with a three - dimensional field theory @xcite . denoting the zero - matsubara modes by @xmath19 , we define the fields and parameters of this theory by @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and obtain the three - dimensional euclidean action [ s3 ] s_3=d^3x . for the determination of quantities that are not governed by the leading ir divergences , one may still use a three - dimensional field theory which",
    ", however , is obtained by a more complicated matching procedure , which introduces corrections to the above relations of the parameters of the @xmath15-dimensional and the three - dimensional theory and also necessitates the inclusion of more interaction terms .",

    "the inclusion of @xmath27 in the definition of @xmath44 is motivated by the fact that then the @xmath45 remain finite even in the limit @xmath46 , facilitating the comparison with the exactly known large-@xmath27 result @xcite .",

    "the ansatz ( [ larggeur ] ) does not account for so - called confluent singularities which cause the true large-@xmath44 expansion to also contain other negative powers of @xmath44 , which are subleading at least compared to @xmath73 .",
    "we can expect methods that can accommodate the leading behavior in ( [ larggeur ] ) correctly to converge faster to the true result than methods having the wrong leading behavior such as e.g.  pad approximants or the linear @xmath74 expansion ( lde ) , the latter being used extensively for the current problem @xcite . on the other hand , convergence will be slowed by the fact that we do not make an ansatz reflecting the full power structure in @xmath44 , but the expansion ( [ larggeur ] ) will try to mimic the neglected subleading powers .",
    "the alternating signs of the @xmath75 suggest that the perturbative series for @xmath42 is borel summable . in the context of critical phenomena",
    ", such series have been successfully resummed using kleinert s vpt .",
    "accurate critical exponents @xcite and amplitude ratios @xcite have been obtained . for a truncated partial sum @xmath76 of ( [ pertsum ] ) , the method requires replacing u_r^l-2 & & ( t)^l-2 \\{1+t}^-(l-2)/ ( note that this is an identity for @xmath77 ) , reexpanding the resulting expression in @xmath78 through @xmath79 , setting @xmath77 and then optimizing in @xmath80 , where optimizing is done in accordance with the principle of minimal sensitivity @xcite and in practice means finding appropriate stationary or turning points .",
    "that is , we replace [ uuhat ] u_r^l-2 ^l-2_k=0^l - l ( -(l-2)/ + k ) ^k and optimize the resulting expression in @xmath80 . for @xmath62 , we obtain the @xmath48-loop approximation of @xmath81 , [ f0 ] f_0^(l)=opt_. results are only available starting at four loops , since two non - zero perturbative coefficients are necessary for vpt to work .",

    "the five- through seven - loop results are @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 .    from the fact that the fixed-@xmath63 results monotonically rise with the loop order , while the results with self - consistent @xmath63 fall , we estimate that the true value lies inbetween and conclude from the resummed results through seven loops that [ c1n2 ] c_1=1.270.11 .",
    "our treatment for @xmath56 may easily be repeated for arbitrary @xmath27 .",

    "this provides additional confidence that in fact both mc and our vpt results are trustworthy estimates for @xmath8 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the coefficient @xmath8 is of physical relevance not only for the case of a strictly homogenous gas , but also for a trap that is sufficiently wide to allow for critical fluctuations @xcite .",
    "if expressed as a function of the total number of particles @xmath102 , the leading effect on the shift of the condensation temperature is obtained from mean field theory and only in second order the influcence of critical fluctuations can be felt @xcite .",
    "in contrast , if expressed in terms of the central density @xmath2 of particles , the leading effect is determined by critical fluctuations as we have seen here .",
    "it would therefore be desirable to know not only the total number of particles @xmath102 ( as in a recent experiment @xcite ) but also the central density of particles in experiments that measure the condensation temperature . in this context",
    "we would also like to stress that it is no contradiction that the sign of the change of @xmath4 is different in both cases , since different physical quantities @xmath102 and @xmath2 are kept fixed , respectively .",
