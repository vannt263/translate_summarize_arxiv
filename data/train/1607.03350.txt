    "up to now the search for lorentz invariance violation ( liv ) has been very elusive , in spite of the tremendous efforts for increasing the precision in the experimental setups . in this contribution",
    "we take the opposite approach , in which spontaneous lorentz symmetry breaking ( slsb ) arising from a more fundamental theory does not lead to observable liv , but rather provides a dynamical interpretation of the corresponding massless gauge bosons in terms of the goldstone modes ( gm ) arising from such spontaneous breaking .",
    "this is an old idea pioneered by dirac,@xcite bjorken,@xcite and nambu , @xcite which has a long history in the literature.@xcite we will not pay attention to the mechanism which induces the slsb and we will just focus on the low energy approximation , where only the gm are excited .",
    "the most economic way to do this is by starting from so called nonabelian nambu models ( nanm ) , which constitute generalizations of the original nambu model.@xcite they are defined by a yang - mills lagrangian , to be called the mother gauge theory ( mgt ) , plus a nonlinear constraint ( nlc ) encoding the slsb , which should be solved and substituted into the lagrangian .",
    "this formulation is analogous to the description of pions in terms of a nonlinear sigma model .",
    "let us start from the following nanm @xmath0 coupled to a conserved current @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 are @xmath3 labels , @xmath4 is the slsb scale and the constant group vector @xmath5 indicates the direction of the vacuum along which the slsb occurs . in this way , one interprets the nonlinear constraint as describing a nonzero vacuum expectation value @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath7 equations of motion arising from the lagrangian ( [ aba : eq1 ] ) can be presented in the form @xmath8 with the notation @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 is the nonabelian faraday tensor and @xmath11 denotes the covariant derivative .",
    "let us observe that the @xmath12 equations of motion for the mgt are @xmath13 , which can be obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ aba : eq0 ] ) by demanding @xmath14 , for example .",
    "let us emphasize that we have two theories with different equations of motion and properties : the nanm is a theory with no gauge invariance having @xmath15 d.o.f .",
    ", coupled to a conserved current , while the mgt is a standard gauge theory with @xmath16 first class constraints , @xmath17 d.o.f . yielding a conserved current.@xcite",
    "the purpose of this note is to determine and clarify the conditions under which a nanm turns out to be equivalent to its mgt .",
    "our main motivation arises from the perturbative calculations previously performed in the abelian case , where a highly nonlinear theory results after the constraint and the lagrangian are written in terms of the field redefinition @xmath18 , with @xmath19 describing the gm excitations . in the tree and",
    "one - loop approximations , the result for the amplitudes for some specific processes is that all liv contributions cancel yielding the standard results in qed.@xcite",
    "following ref .  , the strategy to find the conditions for equivalence is the following : ( 1 ) we take as a benchmark the well - known canonical algebra and hamiltonian of the mgt , in terms of the basic canonical variables @xmath20 .",
    "( 2 ) after solving the nlc we determine the canonical algebra and hamiltonian of the nanm .",
    "the most direct ( and cumbersome ) way to proceed is to solve the nlc for one variable , @xmath21 for example , and start the construction from the remaining @xmath22 coordinates , with the presence of @xmath23 second class constraints . here",
    "we present a convenient parametrization of the nlc that drastically simplifies the procedure .",
    "( 3 ) in any case , it is always possible to express the canonical variables of the nanm in terms of those of the mgt . in this way , we are able to rewrite the canonical algebra and hamiltonian of the nanm in terms of the canonical variables of the mgt .",
    "( 4 ) the comparison of this transcription with the known results in the mgt allows us to establish the required conditions for equivalence .",
    "let us introduce the @xmath15 coordinates @xmath24 , where we split the indices @xmath25 into @xmath26 and @xmath27 , together with the parametrization@xcite @xmath28 with @xmath29",
    ". in terms of the new coordinates the nlc in eq .",
    "( [ aba : eq1 ] ) is identically satisfied .",
    "let us focus now on the invertible change of variables @xmath30 , which yields @xmath31 and @xmath32 , recalling that we also know @xmath33 .",
    "we observe that we will not require the explicit form of the transformations in the following . in this way",
    ", the lagrangian of the nanm can be written as @xmath34 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath24 together with the nanm canonically conjugated momenta @xmath35 satisfy the standard canonical algebra and define a regular system ( i.e. , no constraints appear in this parametrization ) .",
    "the usual definition of the nonabelian electric field , @xmath36 , allows us to obtain the relations @xmath37 next we calculate the nanm hamiltonian @xmath38 and explicitly verify that it can be written as @xmath39 with @xmath40 . here",
    "@xmath41 are just labels for the corresponding functions of @xmath42 , in terms of which it will be simpler to make contact with the mgt .",
    "also , these relations would allow the explicit calculation of algebra among @xmath43 , in terms of the nanm canonical algebra .",
    "let us observe that in the hamiltonian form of the action for the nanm , the last relation in eq .",
    "( [ aba : eq3 ] ) identifies @xmath44 as the canonically conjugated momenta to the coordinates @xmath45 of the mgt .",
    "moreover , since the transformation among the variables @xmath46 and @xmath47 is generated only by the coordinate transformations @xmath48 , we can assert that this is indeed a canonical transformation.@xcite in this way we recover the canonical algebra for the mgt phase - space variables @xmath43 without any further calculation .",
    "summarizing , up to now we have proved that the nanm canonical algebra yields the canonical algebra of the mgt .",
    "nevertheless , both theories are still not equivalent because eq .",
    "( [ aba : eq4 ] ) is not the hamiltonian of the mgt , in spite of its almost identical form .",
    "in fact , @xmath49 are not an arbitrary functions , but only labels for some combinations of the coordinates in the nanm . also , the gauss functions @xmath50 are not constraints , as they should be in a gauge theory . to proceed , we calculate the time evolution of the gauss functions under the nanm dynamics , obtaining @xmath51 where @xmath52 are known functions of nanm phase space . to recover gauge invariance",
    "it is enough to impose the gauss constraints @xmath53 , together with current conservation @xmath54 at a given time slice @xmath55 .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ aba : eq5 ] ) guarantees that @xmath53 at @xmath56 .",
    "then , according to eqs .",
    "( [ aba : eq0 ] ) , the equations of the mgt @xmath57 must be valid at @xmath56 . using the time independent identity @xmath58 we then obtain @xmath54 for @xmath56 .",
    "thus , iterating this procedure from the initial conditions we obtain current conservation and the gauss constraints for all time .",
    "the latter can be added to the hamiltonian ( [ aba : eq4 ] ) as additional constraints via arbitrary functions @xmath59 which now replace @xmath49 by @xmath60 .",
    "the canonical algebra , together with current conservation , guarantees that no additional constraints appear . summarizing , under the initial conditions already specified ,",
    "the equivalence between the nanm and the mgt is established .",
