    "the problem of extrinsic contributions to dielectric , piezoelectric and mechanical properties has been addressed by many authors . in prevailing number , only extrinsic permittivity has been studied .",
    "arlt et al .",
    "@xcite and herbiet _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite were the first , who addressed the domain wall contributions to all involved properties : permittivity @xmath0 , elastic compliance @xmath1 and piezoelectric coefficient @xmath2 in piezoelectric ceramics ( see also a later work of zhang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we have in mind ferroelectric and ferroelastic crystals with only two domain states , in particular , the kh@xmath3po@xmath4 family . in our recent papers",
    ", we studied the equilibrium domain structure in thin films @xcite and equilibrium contributions to permittivity @xcite , piezoelectric coefficient @xcite and to all these properties including elastic compliance @xcite . in these papers",
    "@xcite we have used the model of passive layers ( ferroic layer composite ) , theoretically discussed first by fedosov and sidorkin @xcite , then developed by tagantsev _",
    "_ @xcite and bratkovsky and levanyuk @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall concentrate on following questions : how the geometric and material parameters of the composite effect the extrinsic contributions , and what is the mutual relation of contributions to @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 on the same sample .    in the following sections , we first introduce the model and basic symbols for geometric and material properties of the sample .",
    "then we recapitulate briefly our method of theoretical derivation of equilibrium extrinsic contributions , described in detail in @xcite .",
    "afterwards , we shall summarize and discuss the new results , mentioned above and try to compare them with experiment .",
    "also , in a special case of equal material properties of both passive and central layers , we include the effect of intrinsic piezoelectricity .",
    "these three topics were not discussed in @xcite .",
    "plane . [ arta4:fig01],width=321 ]",
    "we consider a plate - like electroded sample of infinite area with major surfaces perpendicular to the ferroelectric axis @xmath5 .",
    "domains with antiparallel spontaneous polarization @xmath6 differ in the sign of spontaneous shear @xmath7 .",
    "we suppose that usual linear state equations are valid , including intrinsic piezoelectricity .",
    "for simplicity we consider the sample to be elastically isotropic .",
    "the geometric parameters , characterizing the sample and domain structure , are shown in figs .",
    "[ arta4:fig01 ] and [ arta4:fig02 ] .     plane .",
    "[ arta4:fig02],width=321 ]    we introduce the following symbols @xmath8 , the component of relative permittivity of the passive layer ; @xmath9 , the same component for the central ferroic layer ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the shear component of the compliance tensor of the passive and central ferroic layers , respectively ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the piezoelectric coefficient of the passive and central ferroic layers , respectively ; @xmath14 resp .",
    "@xmath15 , the width of the corresponding domain ; @xmath16 , the period of the domain structure ; @xmath2 , the total width of the passive layers ; @xmath17 , the width of the central layer ; @xmath18 , the shear displacement at @xmath19 ; @xmath20 , the external shear stress acting on the sample ; @xmath21 , the external voltage on the electrodes ; @xmath22 , the asymmetry factor of the domain structure , expressing the displacement of the domain walls from the symmetric position .",
    "in this short article , it is not possible to reproduce the whole process of derivation of effective equilibrium permittivity @xmath23 at zero external stress , compliance @xmath24 at zero voltage @xmath21 , and piezocoefficient @xmath25 of the sample .",
    "the process is based on the calculation of the total energy density @xmath26 of the sample , i.e. , electrostatic energy , deformation energy and domain walls energy per unite surface area of the sample in the @xmath27 plane , as a function of free parameters @xmath28 , @xmath21 and @xmath18 resp .",
    "@xmath29 . in equilibrium ,",
    "the variation of the total energy of the isolated system : _ sample _ + _ electric source _ + _ mechanical source _ is zero . solving this standard problem",
    ", we can find the equilibrium reaction of the sample on external voltage or stress .",
    "the process is described in @xcite and we shall prepare more detailed publications in this direction .",
    "because of great complexity of the problem , we shall use the `` thick sample '' approximation , valid when @xmath30    in this case , we can neglect all higher fourier components of the tensor of deformation and electric field , except the constant one .",
    "nevertheless , the formulas for effective parameters are still very complex because of the intrinsic piezoelectricity .",
    "if this is neglected , we get reasonably simple and symmetric results : @xmath31    for thin films , when condition ( [ arta4:eq01 ] ) does not hold , numerical methods should be applied .    in the homogeneous composite case @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34",
    ", we need not to neglect intrinsic piezoelectricity and results are still very simple and symmetric :    @xmath35",
    "equations ( [ arta4:eq02])-([arta4:eq04 ] ) express the dependence of sample effective parameters on both material and geometric parameters of the layer composite . at first , we can mention that for homogeneous composite , these relations transform to ( [ arta4:eq05])-([arta4:eq07 ] ) , without the terms containing @xmath36 .",
    "intrinsic piezoelectricity is neglected in equations ( [ arta4:eq02])-([arta4:eq04 ] ) .",
    "second , we can find the effective parameters of the ferroic sample with thick metal electrodes and without dielectric passive layers , taking the limit of infinite @xmath8 in ( [ arta4:eq02])-([arta4:eq04 ] ) .",
    "third , the denominator on the right in discussed relations is the same and we can easily express the ratio of effective parameters .      in equation ( [ arta4:eq08 ] ) , we find the simple result that domainwalls motion is nownot damped by mechanical interaction with passive layers , as reported in @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ arta4:eq09 ] ) we can easily recognize the pure intrinsic compliance of the composite , without any extrinsic contribution . in the second case",
    "we get @xmath40    now we have got an inverse situation : in equation ( [ arta4:eq10 ] ) , there is pure intrinsic permittivity , without any extrinsic contribution , while equation ( [ arta4:eq11 ] ) is a simple formula that can be implicitly found in @xcite .",
    "naturally , @xmath41 in both limits .",
    "we should mention , that simple limit @xmath42 in equations ( [ arta4:eq08 ] ) and ( [ arta4:eq11 ] ) does not work , because condition ( [ arta4:eq01 ] ) for the thick sample approximation is violated . in the general case ,",
    "@xmath43 , @xmath44 , the effective permittivity and compliance take the value in the corresponding intervals ( [ arta4:eq10 ] ) to ( [ arta4:eq08 ] ) , or ( [ arta4:eq09 ] ) to ( [ arta4:eq11 ] ) .",
    "let us now turn to the homogeneous case of equations ( [ arta4:eq05])-([arta4:eq07 ] ) , where intrinsic piezoelectricity is included .",
    "first , we can see that intrinsic and extrinsic contributions are now explicitly separated.we denote the extrinsic contributions @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "the interrelation of the contributions is now rather simple : @xmath48 from equation ( 12 ) , we get the simple condition @xmath49    the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have measured all three effective parameters on the same @xmath50 sample in the temperature interval of 90 to 140 k under the critical point , resulting in an experimental value of 1,05 for the ratio in equation ( [ arta4:eq13 ] ) .",
    "they have come to the similar result on the base of much more elementary considerations . in @xcite , we presented discussion of other facts concerning the agreement of theory and that experiment .    under the critical temperature of the ferroelectric phase transition ,",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 often undergo substantial changes with changing temperature .",
    "nevertheless , their ratio is almost constant in a wide temperature interval .",
    "this can be explained by simple physical considerations .",
    "the crystals of kdp family undergo the first order phase transition , which is close to the second order one , because discontinuous change of @xmath51 and @xmath52 is relatively small . from the landau - ginzburg theory that is in a good agreement with experiment in this case",
    ", we get that both @xmath51 and @xmath52 are proportional to @xmath53 in the region of temperature @xmath54 under the critical one @xmath55 . as a result , the ratios in equation ( [ arta4:eq12 ] ) should remain also constant in this temperature interval .",
    "this is fully confirmed by the above - mentioned measurements in ref .",
    "the situation here is very similar to that discussed in connection with the so - called pippard - janovec relations ( see the excellent theoretical work of janovec ( 1966 ) @xcite ) .",
    "it is obvious that the results , expressed by equations ( [ arta4:eq12 ] ) , ( [ arta4:eq13 ] ) , are general and independent on the model . on the other side , results ( [ arta4:eq02])-([arta4:eq07 ] )",
    "are partially characteristic for our model because of the presence of geometric factors @xmath56 and @xmath57 and the material factors , characteristic of the passive layers .",
