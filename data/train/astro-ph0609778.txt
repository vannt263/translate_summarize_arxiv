    "measurements of the linear x - ray polarization in solar flares can provide essential information needed to identify the processes responsible for the acceleration of particles and the emission of radiation .",
    "for photon energies in the hard x - ray region , polarization is produced either through electron bremsstrahlung or compton scattering .",
    "the degree of polarization is usually a complex function of the strength and topology of the magnetic field .",
    "thermal distributions of electron velocities result in small polarization values produced mainly by the conduction - driven anisotropy of the electrons in the primary source @xcite with some contribution from photons backscattered in the photosphere .",
    "higher polarization levels are expected from non - thermal anisotropic distributions of electrons that are accelerated in well ordered magnetic fields .",
    "in addition , for such cases the observed polarization degree is related to the photon directivity ( i.e. the anisotropy of the emitted radiation ) , which depends both on the electron beaming details and on the viewing angle .",
    "starting in the late seventies , several non - thermal models of x - ray emission from solar flares were developed ( see and references therein ) .",
    "generally the authors assume a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the solar surface and electrons being accelerated towards the chromosphere (; ; ; ; ) .",
    "these electrons , spiraling downwards along the magnetic field lines , produce bremsstrahlung radiation in collisions with hot plasma .",
    "the polarization in the emitted x - rays is a function of the energy spectra of the electrons , their pitch angles ( angle between their velocity vector and the magnetic field ) , and the column density distribution of the ambient plasma .",
    "studying the spectral characteristics of the detected x - rays provides information about the electron energies , while the polarization is a very sensitive tool to sample the electrons pitch angle distribution . both for very small pitch angles , corresponding to high electron beaming , and for very large ones",
    ", the polarization degree can be equally high .",
    "the two cases can be distinguished by their polarization direction : parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field line , respectively .",
    "the predicted polarization values can reach up to 60% at energies above 50 kev , being even higher at low energies @xcite . after introducing more realistic pitch angle distributions and taking into account photon backscattering processes in the photosphere",
    ", the expected polarization is reduced down to 20% or 30% (; ) .",
    "several more complex non - thermal models have been developed as well . in one of them",
    "the magnetic field structure was defined as a semicircular loop anchored in the chromosphere @xcite .",
    "this approach allowed studying the x - ray emissions separately from different parts of the loop .",
    "the highest polarization could be produced at the top ( up to 85% ) , while the photons observed from the foot - points ( in the region of the dense chromosphere ) would be polarized to the level of around 20% .    in general , lower energies are predicted to yield stronger polarization signals (; ; ) , although the strength of this relation can vary depending on the model . in some recent theories",
    "an opposite trend has also been reported @xcite .",
    "experimental verification is usually difficult because the low - energy part of the spectrum is strongly contaminated by a non - polarized thermal emission .    in all the cases the observed value of flare polarization is strongly dependent on the viewing angle .",
    "the highest polarization values are expected for large angles of view , when the line of sight is perpendicular to the magnetic field line .",
    "thus , most theories predict higher polarization for flares located near the solar limb .",
    "similar behavior is also expected for the directivity of the flare emission : the intensity of the emitted radiation should depend on the angle of view (; ) .",
    "constraints related to the model assumptions favor two possible directions of the polarization vector : either parallel to the plane defined by the magnetic field lines and the line of sight or perpendicular to it (; ; ) .",
    "contrary to the intense theoretical work , only a few polarization measurements have been conducted in hard x - rays . in this energy range",
    ", the commonly used technique is based on compton scattering @xcite .",
    "first attempts were done at energies around 15 kev by , , and using polarimeter instruments on board of several intercosmos satellites . although initial results @xcite showed a linear polarization of around 40% @xmath1 20% , the later studies of different flares (; ) found their polarization degrees always compatible with zero . moreover , the data suffered from limited photon statistics and systematic errors related with the detector calibration .    in measurements of solar flare polarization with the reuven ramaty high energy spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ) , compton scattering can occur in a specially installed beryllium scatterer .",
    "this method can only be used at low energies ( 20100 kev ) .",
    "its details , together with rhessi s polarimetric features , are described in and .",
    "the latest measurements at energies below 100 kev have been performed with the spr - n instrument on board of the coronas - f satellite by . from a sample of 25 solar flares , these authors determined upper limits on the polarization degree in the range from 8 to 40% ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "only for the single case of the 29 october 2003 flare they found a significant polarization degree , which increases from about 50% at energies @xmath3 , up to more than 70% for the energy channel @xmath4 .",
    "recently published , the only two measurements of solar flare polarization at high energies ( 0.21 mev ) , show 1@xmath5 values of 21% @xmath1 10% and -11% @xmath1 5% for one flare close to the limb and another near the sun center , respectively @xcite . in their studies ,",
    "the authors applied the polarimetric capabilities of the rhessi satellite in the coincidence mode , i.e. without using the be - scatterer .    in this paper , we present results in the energy range from 100 kev to 350 kev , obtained for seven solar flares ( x and m classes ) also selected from the rhessi instrument database .",
    "we used a method based on the scattering of photons from detector to detector of rhessi that has previously been applied for polarization studies of gamma ray bursts (; ; ) .    in  [ sec :",
    "method ] we explain how rhessi can be used as a compton polarimeter to study linear x - ray polarization at energies @xmath6 100 kev . the flares selected for analysis , and the criteria used for their selections is detailed in  [ sec : flselec ] .",
    "monte carlo simulations were performed to calculate the response of the instrument , and their results are discussed in  [ sec : simulation ] .",
    "the final polarization results are described and compared with previous measurements in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the interpretation of the results is done in  [ sec : interpretation ] by comparing with theoretical predictions .",
    "finally , a brief summary of the conclusions of our work is given in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the reuven ramaty high energy spectroscopic imager @xcite was designed to observe solar flares from 3 kev up to 17 mev .",
    "it is capable of making spatially , spectrally and temporally resolved images of the sun @xcite using the rotation modulation principle (; ) .",
    "the spacecraft is rotating with a period t @xmath7 4 seconds . the rhessi angular position in the solar coordinate system",
    "is calculated using the satellite roll angle , which is continuously monitored by the spacecraft aspect systems (; ) .",
    "the rhessi spectrometer @xcite consists of 9 cooled germanium detectors which are split in a thin front and a thick rear segment .",
    "low - energy photons are mostly stopped in the front segments while high - energy photons can pass through and reach the rear segments .",
    "the energy resolution is in the order of a few kev .",
    "the arrangement of the 9 detectors in the spectrometer is sketched in figure  [ fig : spectrometer ] .",
    "each photon recorded by rhessi is characterized by its arrival time , deposited energy , detector number and segment .",
    "these parameters are stored in the rhessi event list .",
    "the time resolution of rhessi is equal to one binary microsecond ( 1b@xmath8s = @xmath9 sec ) .",
    "polarization measurements are possible using photons that are compton - scattered from one detector into another one , making a signal in both of them . for such events ,",
    "the effective area is very small , as most of the photons are either completely absorbed ( in photopeak reactions ) or scattered off the spectrometer @xcite .",
    "therefore , only a small percentage of all photons observed by rhessi produces more than one entry in the event list .",
    "the fact that rhessi rotates allows reducing the systematic errors in the polarization analysis .",
    "the compton scattering probability of photons on free electrons is given by the cross section @xcite :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the classical electron radius , @xmath12 is the angle between photon infall and outfall direction , and @xmath13 is the angle between the infall polarization and the outfall direction .",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the energies of the photon before and after the scattering , respectively .",
    "the cross section ( @xmath5 ) is minimal if @xmath13 = 0@xmath16 and maximal if @xmath13 = 90@xmath16 .",
    "the dependence of the cross section on @xmath13 is most pronounced if @xmath12 = 90@xmath16 . as the rhessi axis is pointing to the sun ,",
    "the detectors plane is perpendicular to the photon infall direction , and therefore @xmath17 for detector - to - detector scattering .    in order to extract compton scattered photons from the rhessi event list ,",
    "several cuts were applied ( see table  [ tb : cuts ] ) .",
    ".selection of cuts introduced to extract compton scattered photons from the event list . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the @xmath18 values of table  [ tb : chi2 ] we can reject the model 5 from , with a 90% of confidence .",
    "for the rest of the models the @xmath18 are very close to unity , preventing us from distinguishing between them . within the error bars ,",
    "they all agree with the experimental data equally well .",
    "the same is also valid for the 0% polarization hypothesis .",
    "further refinement would require a polarimeter able to deliver data with error bars on the level of 12 percent .",
    "measurements of hard x - ray polarization have been performed for six x - class and one m - class flares from the rhessi database .",
    "our flare sample was identified after applying selection criteria to the signal strength , background levels and level of contamination by charged particles in rhessi detectors . the selected energy range , from 100 to 350 kev , connects the old (; ; ) and new @xcite results at low energies with the only measurement reported at a high energy band @xcite .",
    "we found values for the polarization degree in the range between 2% and 54% , with statistical errors from 10% to 26% at the @xmath0 level .",
    "the polarization angles are distributed between @xmath19 and @xmath20 in heliocentric coordinates .",
    "they do not show any preferential orientation of the polarization , neither parallel nor perpendicular , with respect to the radial direction defined by the position of the flare in the sun .",
    "in addition , no significant dependency between the orientation of the polarization and the distance of the flares to the sun center was found .",
    "the polarization orientation with respect to the line that joins the two major foot - points of the flare was also studied . for this purpose ,",
    "images of the flares were constructed with rhessi at different energies .",
    "the emission above @xmath2130 kev was found to be produced around the foot - points .",
    "however , no correlation between polarization direction and foot - points orientation was found .",
    "similarly , no relationship between solar flare intensity and polarization degree could be observed .",
    "the polarization degree from the 23 july 2002 flare measured by at high energies is in agreement with our results at the @xmath22 level .",
    "their conclusion about the orientation of polarization respect to the radial direction passing trough the flare position ( perpendicular to it for flares in the limb and parallel for flares close to center ) can not be confirmed by our measurements .",
    "our angles are distributed between @xmath23 and @xmath24 independently on the flare location .",
    "comparison with theoretical predictions is more complex , as the direction of the polarization is expected by the theory to change around 300 kev @xcite .",
    "again , more observations with better accuracy are needed .    regarding the low energy measurements , our data are in good agreement with the recent results from the spr - n instruments on board of the coronas - f satellite @xcite , typically within @xmath25 .",
    "their large sample of 25 solar flares reveals low polarization degrees , providing @xmath2 upper limits from 8 to 40% .",
    "unfortunately , no information is given about the polarization direction .",
    "in the 29 october 2003 flare , for which the coronas - f team claims a polarization of 70% , rhessi measurements were contaminated by charged particles .",
    "theoretical predictions of the non - thermal bremsstrahlung emission provide polarization levels of the order of 20% .",
    "however , depending on the assumptions used by different authors , the expected polarization can differ not only by its value , but also by its orientation ( see , for example , the calculations at 100 kev from and ) .",
    "as the statistical uncertainties provided by our instrument are in the same order as the model predictions , equally good agreement is found for any of them as well as for the case of 0% polarization . in order to distinguish between different models , polarimetry measurements of at least 2% accuracy",
    "are needed .",
    "only model number 5 from , predicting polarization up to 85% , could be rejected by our rhessi data . in this model",
    ", the magnetic field has the same strength at the top and the bottom of the loop , and the electrons spiral at pitch angles close to @xmath26 .",
    "rhessi has made the first steps towards the understanding of the polarization phenomena in solar flares above 100 kev , where non - thermal emission dominates .",
    "measurements with accuracy better than 10 to 20% were , however , hardly possible .",
    "this is due to its small effective area and high levels of flare - induced background .",
    "continuation of such studies will require a dedicated polarimeter that must solve the problems inherent to the rhessi design .",
    "emphasis should be put on increasing the effective area and improving the background rejection capabilities . in particular",
    ", a better time resolution will reduce the number of accidental coincidences , and the optimization of the detector dimensions will improve the detection efficiency for the compton scattering ."
