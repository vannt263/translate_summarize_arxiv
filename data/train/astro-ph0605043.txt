    "if the relative size between the aperture and galaxy was a major cause of discrepancy between narrowband and spectroscopic measurements , we would expect the agreement between the two measurements to be better for smaller galaxies .",
    "the upper left plot of suggests the flux loss for larger galaxies is indeed significant .",
    "the upper right plot shows a strong positive correlation between the discrepancy in  flux and the continuum flux density measurements .",
    "notably our flux - calibrated spectra could underestimate _ both _",
    "emission flux and continuum flux density by up to a factor of @xmath123 , ignoring possible outliers for which the ratios were @xmath124 .",
    "the linear correlation , which appears to be followed , is expected if the discrepancy between narrowband and spectroscopic measurements is dominated by the systematic error in flux calibration .",
    "the upper plots appear to suggest the presence of aperture effect and systematic error in flux calibration .",
    "the corresponding trends are harder to observe in lower plots , comparing spectroscopic and narrowband equivalent widths .",
    "spectroscopic  equivalent widths are slightly greater in general than those from narrowband measurements .",
    "the sloping continuum of the balmer break around @xmath0}}{\\mbox{$\\lambda$}}3727 $ ] usually causes the continuum blueward of the line to have lower flux density than that of the redward continuum .",
    "we suspected this underestimate of continuum flux density at  might cause narrowband  emission equivalent widths to become systematically stronger , but the effect appears negligible .",
    "if we suppose the underestimate of spectroscopic flux is caused by the aperture effect and/or misalignment , it is only to the extent that the underlying stellar population covered by the aperture does not change substantially because the equivalent width measurements show little trend with the source isophotal area and the discrepancy of their continuum flux densities .",
    "however , the plots do indicate a few low-  measurements yield very large equivalent widths , probably due to poorly defined continuum flux density .",
    "we conclude that our flux - calibrated spectra can yield underestimates by a factor of up to @xmath123 for absolute physical quantities due to the combination of aperture effect , misalignment , and systematic error in flux - calibration but only to the extent that the equivalent widths remain robust .",
    "we also note there also was a slight seeing variation which would affect flux measurements .",
    "at least some of unusually large spectroscopic  equivalent widths are likely to be caused by large uncertainties in the continuum flux density near emission line .",
    "some of the observed  emission could be from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . in",
    "we show a line ratio diagnostics diagram for agn activity using the scheme outlined in @xcite . only the objects with",
    "measured line fluxes necessary to compute the diagnostic ratios are in the diagram . a similar diagram using @xmath125}}{\\mbox{$\\lambda$}}{\\mbox{$\\lambda$}}6716,31 $ ] doublet was not made since the lines were outside the observed window or severely compromised by sky lines .",
    "we deviated from their scheme in that the distinction between agn - like and  region - like galaxies was made at @xmath126}}{\\mbox{$\\lambda$}}6583 / { \\mbox{h$\\alpha$}}= 0.5 $ ] , instead of @xmath127 , to include objects whose spectra apparently have broad emission lines upon visual inspection .",
    "this criterion identifies a total of @xmath128 galaxies to be agn - like , @xmath105 of which can not be plotted in for their lack of either  or  measurements .",
    "for comparison , more recent demarcation from @xcite and @xcite are also shown .",
    "we see that the agn identification is indeed sensitive to the choice of demarcation , yet we keep the above criterion since it does remove objects with visually identifiable broad emission lines .",
    "the diagnostic line fluxes are not corrected for reddening , but taking a ratio to the nearest balmer line , e.g. , @xmath28}}{\\mbox{$\\lambda$}}5007 /{\\mbox{h$\\beta$}}$ ] and @xmath126}}{\\mbox{$\\lambda$}}6583 /{\\mbox{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] minimizes the effect of reddening ; applying reddening correction did not change the results significantly . in order to include more objects in this diagnosis , however , we deviated from our convention of using the best  spectrum and used a secondary spectrum if agn diagnostics can not be done otherwise ( ) ; if a spectrum from a repeat observation at a lower  but with both @xmath126}}{\\mbox{$\\lambda$}}6583 $ ] and  measurements exist , we used that spectrum to do the agn diagnostic .    as far as their  colors are concerned , it is hard to distinguish agn - like galaxies from the rest of the  emitters , although they are found mostly toward the bright end in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "it should also be noted that our agn - like galaxies are not detected in previous x - ray observations ; we will discuss the implication of these results in a forth - coming paper in the series .",
    "most cluster emitters are classified as normal star - forming ,  region - like galaxies . where appropriate , @xmath128 objects identified to be agn - like will be removed from subsequent analysis of star - forming galaxies .",
    "we derived reddening  from the balmer decrement of either @xmath129 or @xmath130 emission line flux ratio , depending on the availability of the lines , with the presumed theoretical line ratios of @xmath131 and @xmath132 for case b recombination at @xmath133 and @xmath134 from @xcite . the relation to convert the observed flux @xmath79 into the intrinsic flux @xmath135 is @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the extinction curve described in @xcite .",
    "being derived from a ratio of nebular emission lines ,  therefore is the amount of reddening in the nebular component , which is generally greater by a factor of @xmath138 than that measured in the stellar component ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , the spectral region around the redshifted  often suffer from a telluric absorption feature near @xmath139 , so the quantities derived partially from  measurements tend to have large uncertainties .",
    "we emphasize that the high uncertainty in our  measurements is largely the consequence of deriving the uncertainty in line flux from the rms of gaussian fit , but it is the  _ absorption profile _ which gets partially contaminated by the telluric feature at the redshift of interest .",
    "the gaussian fitting itself was done with weighting by inverse variance , which includes the uncertainty due to sky subtraction ( ) .",
    "therefore we may have overestimated the uncertainty in emission flux , which is almost never compromised by the same sky line .",
    "we also make clear that at  the emission and absorption profiles could almost always be fit separately ; therefore the derived  do not get overestimated from possible underestimation of underlying absorption at ( ) .      the empirical correlation between @xmath0}}{\\mbox{$\\lambda$}}3727 $ ] emission line and  fluxes calibrated by @xcite and @xcite",
    "is often used to estimate star formation rate ( sfr ) of distant galaxies , since the  doublet is the strongest emission line in the blue that remains available within the optical range for high-@xmath91 galaxies . in",
    "we show the dependence of the observed @xmath0}}/{\\mbox{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] line flux ratio on the amount of reddening  and galaxy luminosity .",
    "the absolute @xmath140-band magnitudes , @xmath141 ( on the vega scale ) , are derived from the reddening - corrected @xmath41 and @xmath17 photometry using software package kcorrect ( v4_1_4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the relative independence of @xmath0}}/{\\mbox{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] on dust reddening after correction is one of the basic assumptions for the reliability of @xmath0}}{\\mbox{$\\lambda$}}3727 $ ] emission as a star formation indicator . to compare with previous studies ,",
    "we compute the mean @xmath0}}/{\\mbox{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] for the  emitters identified to be regular region - like galaxies ( ) . before reddening correction , the mean ratio of @xmath0}}/{\\mbox{h$\\alpha$}}= 0.56 \\pm 0.01 $ ] is comparable to @xmath142 and @xmath143 measured by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "after correction , the ratio becomes @xmath144 for our sample , which is slightly lower than @xmath145 and @xmath146 obtained by the aforementioned studies .",
    "the ranges of luminosities in these samples are roughly consistent with each other .",
    "the range of  in implies a significant fraction of  emitters suffers high degree of dust reddening . whereas the galaxies @xcite used for their calibration of sfr",
    "mostly have the extinction of @xmath147 , a significant fraction of our cluster  emitting sample has @xmath148 .",
    "it is well known that optical diagnostic methods such as @xmath0}}{\\mbox{$\\lambda$}}3727 $ ] emission line flux severely underestimate the amount of star - formation activities in presence of high dust reddening , when no extinction correction is made .",
    "although a very strong trend with  is removed by reddening correction , the ratio @xmath0}}/{\\mbox{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] for very dusty galaxies remains about a factor of two lower than the mean for the entire sample .",
    "indeed the low @xmath0}}/{\\mbox{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] ratio of the high-  galaxies caused our mean @xmath0}}/{\\mbox{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] to be lower than the ratios measured by previous studies mentioned above . based on the figure , the reliability of the widely used sfr calibration between  and  emission lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may not extend to very dusty galaxies in general , e.g. , @xmath149 , which appear abundant in high-@xmath91 universe and have been reported to show smaller @xmath0}}/{\\mbox{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] as well @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the uncorrected @xmath0}}/{\\mbox{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] shows a modest trend with luminosity in .",
    "although reddening correction appears to remove the luminosity trend , a few very low-@xmath0}}/{\\mbox{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] galaxies do not move closer to the mean ratio .",
    "in fact , these are @xmath148 galaxies , and their distribution in luminosity does not appear to show a strong trend .    as reported by @xcite , the relations among the @xmath0}}/{\\mbox{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] ratio , dust reddening , and luminosity appear coupled , yet our cluster  emitting sample in shows that @xmath0}}/{\\mbox{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] has the strongest trend with the amount of dust reddening , and for very dusty galaxies , their @xmath0}}/{\\mbox{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] ratio remains lower than the locally measured means regardless of their luminosity . the primary reason for this trend may be the dependence of @xmath0}}/{\\mbox{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] ratio on the ionization state and the gas phase metallicity of emission nebula as reported in metal - rich @xcite and metal - poor galaxies @xcite . to study the relevance of @xmath0}}/{\\mbox{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] ratio",
    "further , it is necessary to constrain and consider the gas - phase metallicity and ionization state of galaxies in our sample .",
    "the mass associated with the stellar component of a galaxy is better traced in redder passbands , which measure flux from the part of galaxy spectrum relatively insensitive to the recent star formation history and also suffers less dust extinction .",
    "the reddest imaging in our survey is sloan @xmath17 , so we could take the observed @xmath17 magnitude as the quantitative estimate for the underlying stellar mass , or more generally the size , of a galaxy . in the cluster rest - frame",
    "the sloan @xmath17 filter really samples the @xmath140-band light of galaxy spectrum .",
    "thus @xmath17 magnitude is not the best proxy for the underlying stellar population that dominates the stellar mass composition of a galaxy .",
    "an instantaneous burst model of @xcite shows that at @xmath150 a starburst fraction of only @xmath151 can make a dominant contribution to the visual spectrum at @xmath152 on top of @xmath153-old stellar population .",
    "although we use extinction - corrected absolute @xmath140 magnitude to estimate the intrinsic luminosity or size of galaxies , some caution should be exercised to interpret our results , as the quantities are highly dependent on their sfhs .",
    "previous studies have noted that the  equivalent widths tend to anti - correlate with luminosity @xcite . in , we observe similar trend in  and equivalent widths ( measured with the flux - summing method ) . since the completeness limit of survey was @xmath96 } } ) \\simeq 11~{\\mbox{\\aa}}$ ] at @xmath154 ( @xmath155 ) , the lack of intrinsically faint weak  emitters is partly a result of selection effect .",
    "a few faint galaxies have ill - defined , low - continuum which could produce unusually large  equivalent widths ( ) , but our measurement and associated uncertainty of equivalent widths via the flux - summing method ( ) generally is robust even with low-  spectra , i.e. , it does not show a systematic bias toward larger equivalent widths unlike when a gaussian is fitted to a low-  line profile .",
    "we checked the robustness by artificially degrading a high-  spectrum , with which a robust measurement of equivalent widths can be made , and actually measuring equivalent widths by the flux - summing method .",
    "although very strong  equivalent widths , e.g. , @xmath96 } } ) \\la -100~{\\mbox{\\aa}}$ ] , are generally observed with large uncertainties in faint galaxies below the survey completeness limit , the anti - correlation between the emission equivalent width and galaxy luminosity is clearly observed in  emission but appears almost non - existent in emission . at a glance , there is a strong suppression of emission equivalent widths in very luminous galaxies .",
    "in fact , some of the most luminous galaxies , i.e. , @xmath156 , are classified as agn - like , whereas few very luminous galaxies with high  emission equivalent width exist in the same luminosity range . that agns are preferentially hosted in very luminous objects",
    "is not surprising , but it is not clear that the absence of low - luminosity agns ( i.e. , @xmath157 ) is real or is due to selection bias .",
    "it is known that the strength of  and  emission , when excited by agns , correlates tightly with the agn luminosity .",
    "therefore if the observed mean equivalent width of the luminous agn - like galaxies , of order of @xmath158 , were to set roughly the maximum equivalent width , most agns of lower luminosity would be expected to drop out of our detection limit .",
    "a potentially intriguing interpretation of is a manifestation of so - called _ downsizing effect _ , which refers to observational evidence for the redshift evolution of characteristic galaxy luminosity above which star formation activities are suppressed @xcite .",
    "such characteristic luminosity at which the suppression of vigorously star - forming galaxies evolves toward less luminous end at lower redshifts .",
    "now , agn activity has been shown by simulations to be more effective in suppressing star formation in major galaxy mergers than those involving no nuclear activities @xcite .",
    "visual inspection of our images indicates the agn - like galaxies to be located in among the densest regions in terms of projected surface number density of galaxies . our imaging does not have the resolution to clearly see the signature of mergers , yet",
    "the distribution of agn - like galaxies in our sample might suggest the implicit role of agn activities in regulating star formation activity in large galaxies . while the interpretation is highly speculative and",
    "there have been little direct observational support , recently a number of studies which provide circumstantial evidence in support for this scenario have been emerging .",
    "for example , the buildup of cluster red sequence appears to start from the high - luminosity end @xcite , while the number of post - starburst galaxies appear to host agn activities ( c. tremonti et al .",
    "2006 , private communication ) .",
    "in view of these recent findings , the weaker  equivalent widths found in high - luminosity agn - like galaxies in our sample are at least consistent with agns suppressing cluster star - forming activities .",
    "we will revisit this argument by analyzing the star formation histories , local environments , and archival  morphology of the cluster  emitters in the forthcoming paper in the series .",
    "putting the high - luminosity  emitters aside , interpreting such a luminosity trend as in is not trivial , since both metallicity and the amount of dust extinction generally show a positive trend with galaxy luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and affect star formation diagnostics like emission equivalent width . in particular , @xcite found in their sample of local galaxies drawn from the stromlo - apm redshift survey that the star formation rate per unit luminosity showed little dependence on luminosity , when dust extinction was properly accounted for .",
    "we see an indication of significance of dust extinction when  and  emission equivalent widths are compared , i.e. ,  equivalent widths show a stronger trend with luminosity than  equivalent widths .",
    "the equivalent width of nebular emission line such as  and is essentially a ratio of the total emission flux from an ensemble of localized  regions to the continuum emission from stellar population more widely distributed throughout a galaxy .",
    "it is empirically known that nebular emission lines suffer more dust extinction than the stellar continuum @xcite .",
    "therefore dust extinction generally reduces the strength of emission equivalent width , and that effect is selectively stronger at shorter wavelengths , i.e. , blue emission line suffers more from this effect due to the wavelength dependence of dust absorption . in",
    "we see that the reddening  of cluster  emitters shows a trend with their luminosity , especially at the most luminous end ; the @xcite sample showed a similar trend , although their galaxies were not as reddened as ours .",
    "thus the observed trend of decreasing emission equivalent widths with galaxy luminosity in could be enhanced by the greater amount of dust extinction in high luminosity galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the positive luminosity trend of  points to the importance of metallicity in decoupling the @xmath0}}/{\\mbox{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] ratio trend with luminosity and reddening ( ) , since the dust abundance is expected to scale with metallicity , and the @xmath0}}/{\\mbox{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] ratio of nearby galaxies has been shown to correlate nontrivially with the metallicity as well as ionization state of emission nebula @xcite . with rather large uncertainties",
    ", we may not convincingly say if the low - luminosity galaxies in our sample are more reddened than the local counterparts . yet",
    "a preliminary analysis of the -strong galaxy fraction in our sample shows a higher incidence of dusty starburst galaxies in this cluster compared to a local field sample , probably due to galaxy - galaxy interactions . in a future paper",
    "we also wish to explore the metallicity effect on @xmath0}}/{\\mbox{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] .",
    "we have reported on a spectroscopic follow - up confirmation of faint  emitters in catalogued by .",
    "the keck  i / lris and keck  ii / deimos spectra have confirmed @xmath0}}{\\mbox{$\\lambda$}}3727 $ ] emission lines of the narrowband - selected cluster  emitters at a @xmath1 success rate for faint ( @xmath159 ) blue ( @xmath3 ) galaxies .",
    "the rate for the successful detection of  emission is a strong function of galaxy color , generally proving the efficacy of narrowband technique supplemented with broadband colors in wide - field search for faint emission - line objects .",
    "balmer decrement - derived reddening measurements show these galaxies are very dusty , with a significant fraction of the population showing @xmath160 . even after correcting for dust extinction ,",
    "the @xmath0}}/{\\mbox{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] ratio for very high  galaxies remains generally lower by a factor of @xmath138 than the mean @xmath0}}/{\\mbox{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] ratios reported by the studies of nearby galaxies .",
    "a slight luminosity trend of @xmath0}}/{\\mbox{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] can be mostly removed by reddening correction , yet the emission line flux ratio for high-  galaxies remains much lower regardless of their luminosity . in a future paper , we will further test the metallicity dependence of @xmath0}}/{\\mbox{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] ratio , which the previous studies of nearby galaxies have shown to be strong .",
    "the luminosity trend of  and  emission equivalent width strength , coupled with the abundance of luminous agn - like galaxies , is consistent with agns suppressing star - forming activities for massive cluster galaxies , although further studies specifically addressing this issue need to be carried out .",
