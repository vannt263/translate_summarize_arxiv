    "the important role of phonons influencing the properties of systems based on semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) has been demonstrated in many works reviewed in refs.@xcite .",
    "the spatial confinement effect on optical phonons in qds has been studied experimentally and understood theoretically @xcite .",
    "acoustic phonons have also received some attention in connection with the low - frequency raman scattering in spherical@xcite and self - assembled@xcite qds , and homogeneous broadening of the spectral lines @xcite .",
    "electron - phonon interaction in qds remains , however , a controversial subject . while calculations performed for ii - vi and iii - v dots generally agree that the exciton - phonon ( e - ph ) coupling strength is reduced in nanocrystals compared to the bulk , they disagree regarding the numbers and trends in scaling of this interaction with qd size .",
    "( electron - hole pairs will be traditionally called here excitons independently of the importance of the coulomb interaction . )",
    "the calculated values vary substantially depending on the approximations used , but the huang - rhys parameter for the lowest exciton state usually does not exceed @xmath0 for ii - vi for spherical qds@xcite and is probably an order of magnitude smaller for iii - v self - assembled dots@xcite .    turning to the experimental data ,",
    "the exciton - optical - phonon coupling strength is most frequently obtained from pl spectra .",
    "usually there is a large stokes shift of the excitonic pl band with respect to the absorption in small ii - vi qds @xcite , which can be explained by strong exciton - phonon coupling ( huang - rhys parameter of the order of 1@xcite ) .",
    "however , as mentioned above , the calculated values happen to be one or two orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "phonon replica in the pl spectra caused by the recombination of excitons in qds were found to disagree with the well - known franck - condon progression both in their spectral positions@xcite and relative intensities@xcite .",
    "although both the strong stokes shift and apparently large intensity of the first phonon satellite ( relative to the zero phonon line ) can be characteristic of the qd size distribution and not of a single dot @xcite , these results indicate that the e - ph interaction in qds must be considered carefully .",
    "further evidence for this comes from the optical absorption measurements .",
    "lo - phonon related features were observed in absorption spectra of inas / gaas qds and 2lo @xcite and even 3lo@xcite phonon replica were found extraordinarily strong compared to the 1lo phonon satellite .",
    "at least some of these works were performed using single qd spectroscopy , so , ensemble effects can probably be ruled out in this case . since no phonon replica were found in the corresponding emission spectra , there is no way to explain these results in terms of the franck - condon progression with any value of @xmath1 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the homogeneous broadening of the absorption spectra of spherical ii - vi qds studied in refs.@xcite was found to have a clear contribution of optical phonons .",
    "this is unexpected , because coupling of optical phonons to a single electron or exciton level should lead to the appearance of discrete satellites and not to the level broadening .",
    "thinking in terms of fermi s golden rule , the broadening could be a lifetime effect owing to the electron ( or exciton ) transition to another state with emission or absorption of an optical phonon .",
    "however , it would require strict energy conservation in the electron - phonon scattering , i.e. exact resonance between the optical phonon energy and level spacing , which should be rather accidental .",
    "this kind of argument also justified the theoretical concept of `` phonon bottleneck '' , a very slow carrier relaxation which should be inherent to small qds@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , an efficient phonon - mediated carrier relaxation has been reported in a number of works @xcite .",
    "all these experimental results imply that multiphonon processes are important and that the e - ph interaction in qds must be treated in a non - perturbative way , even for the moderate values of the coupling constants coming out from the calculations@xcite .",
    "an important ingredient to be included is the non - adiabaticity of this interaction @xcite leading to a phonon - mediated coupling of different electronic levels , even if they are separated by an energy quite different from the optical phonon energy .",
    "this is essential for understanding those experimental results which are in clear disagreement with the single level - generated franck - condon progression .",
    "polaron effects in qds have been studied theoretically in several recent papers @xcite .",
    "the model considered in these works included two electronic levels and several einstein phonon modes .",
    "the one - electron spectral function was obtained applying either self - consistent perturbation theory approximations @xcite or exactly , using a combined analytical and numerical approach @xcite .",
    "the results calculated using the perturbation theory approaches show shift and broadening of the levels , even for a sufficiently large detuning ( defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the electron energy levels and @xmath6 is the phonon energy ) .",
    "however , as pointed out in refs.@xcite , this broadening is an artifact .",
    "the exact spectral function should consist of @xmath7-functions ( if no further effects are involved ) .",
    "moreover , even if these @xmath7-functions are broadened artificially , the self - consistent perturbation theory approximations are not able to reproduce the structure of the spectrum calculated exactly using the approach proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the method of ref.@xcite based on the gram - schmidt orthogonalization procedure is , however , limited to the case when all the optical phonons have the same energy . in reality ,",
    "confined optical phonon modes are characterized by different frequencies within the band of the corresponding bulk material .",
    "usually there are a small number of such modes that interact more intensively with electrons or excitons @xcite .",
    "the incorporation of this multiplicity seems to be important for comparison of calculated and experimental results .",
    "the limitation of the approach@xcite ( based on the davydov canonical transformation ) consists in neglecting the multiphonon processes .",
    "another important issue is the role of acoustic phonons .",
    "even though some acoustic modes can be confined to the qd and therefore have discrete energies , there should be a continuum of modes within a certain energy range .",
    "the interaction with this continuum should smooth out the polaron spectrum ( otherwise consisting of @xmath8functions , as noted above ) .",
    "the lineshape is not expected to be a simple lorentzian for a qd , instead , acoustic phonon sidebands are formed for a discrete electronic level @xcite . considering",
    "the simultaneous interaction of confined excitons with acoustic and optical phonons can reveal some new effects and , to the best of our knowledge , has not been performed beyond the one - level model @xcite .    in this paper , we propose a non - perturbative approach to the calculation of the phonon effects on the electron spectral function , and emission and absorption spectra of a qd , based on direct numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix including a small number of electronic levels and several optical phonon modes of different energy .",
    "such a straightforward method was employed in ref.@xcite for phonons strongly coupled to an electron on a deep donor center .",
    "this approach is developed further here so as to allow for the incorporation of the interaction with ( virtually all ) acoustic phonon modes , under the condition that the inter - level coupling mediated by solely acoustic phonons can be neglected .",
    "we present calculated results which elucidate the influence of various relevant parameters , such as inter - level spacing , coupling strengths and temperature , on the optical spectra of a model qd .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the hamiltonian matrix to be diagonalized in order to obtain the polaron states , and define the electron green s function . in sec .",
    "iii , we derive the expression for the imaginary part of the exciton dielectric function and present the absorption and emission spectra calculated for different values of the relevant parameters .",
    "iv is devoted to the interaction with acoustic phonons and its incorporation into the calculation of the polaron spectra .",

    "the maximum number of phonons necessary to reproduce correctly several lowest - energy eigenvalues ( which are of importance for relevant temperatures ) depends on the coupling strengths but is not large .",

    "such a choice is justified by the fact that only a fraction of acoustic phonons can be described by a propagating wave assumed in the appendix .",

    "the non - diagonal term with @xmath135 leads to acoustic phonon  mediated mixing of the polaron states .",
    "it will be considered in a future work .",
    "let us start the discussion by emphasizing that only in a hypothetical case when the phonon  mediated coupling of the lowest energy exciton state to all other states can be neglected ( for example , in the limit of extremely strong confinement , such that @xmath136 , or if @xmath137 is small because of the symmetry of the corresponding wavefunctions ) , one can expect to observe franck - condon progressions in the emission and absorption spectra associated with this state@xcite . this is the only case when the huang - rhys parameter describes the spectra in entirety . as it is obvious from eq.([alpha ] ) , the _ diagonal _ coupling is proportional to the ( integrated ) difference between the electron and hole charge densities , which is non - zero mostly due to the fact that the conduction and valence bands in ii - vi and iii - v materials have different symmetry . even if some further effects ( like the presence of defects or strain , for example ) contribute to the separation of the electron and hole clouds in space@xcite , one can hardly expect an order of magnitude increase of this parameter , compared to the calculated values cited in the introduction .",
    "it means that the intensity of the lo phonon sidebands must be rather small and monotonically decreasing with the increase of the number of phonons .",
    "however , in most cases the phonon  mediated interlevel coupling , at least between the subsequent exciton states , should be important .",
    "the off - diagonal interaction constant is likely to exceed the diagonal ones .",
    "for instance , if the two exciton levels are different by the hole state ( e.g. , @xmath78 and @xmath79 states in a spherical ii - vi qd ) , it is easy to see from eq.([alpha ] ) that ( neglecting the coulomb interaction between the electron and hole ) , @xmath138 that is , there is no compensation effect for this interaction .",
    "the spectra calculated assuming only the off - diagonal interaction ( figs.1,2 ) show characteristic features known as rabi splitting , which is obtained already in the rw approximation ( see eq.([branches ] ) ) and has been observed experimentally@xcite .",
    "contrary to the rw approximation , the exact results also show a downwards shift of the spectral lines ( see fig.1 . in the rw approximation ,",
    "the most intense peak should be situated exactly at @xmath139 ) .",
    "even if the upper level is dipole forbidden , its presence manifests itself by the spectral features seen in fig.2 .",
    "note that the off - diagonal coupling is not resonant as one might expect thinking in terms of the fermi s golden rule .",
    "the manifold produced by the coupling persists even for quite a large detuning @xmath140 .",
    "curiously , it is reminiscent of sidebands which might appear due to interaction with confined acoustic phonons .    when both diagonal and off - diagonal interactions are present , the effect is not just a sum of those owing to each of them , but also some additional spectral features appear ( see figs.3 - 5 showing the effect of different parameters ) .",
    "the stronger are the interactions , the richer the structure of the spectra .",
    "it should also be noted that the symmetry between the absorption and emission spectra , which is characteristic of the one - level independent boson model ( see the upper panel of fig.5 ) , disappears when the off - diagonal interaction is included .",
    "this holds also at low temperatures where a small number of spectral features are seen ( fig.3 , lower panel ) .",
    "those below @xmath141 in the emission spectrum are due to the diagonal coupling to the lowest energy exciton state .",

    "let us turn to the acoustic phonons .",
    "the explicit calculation leads to a self  energy which depends on the spectral variable in a sophisticated way .",
    "accordingly , the line shape is quite different from the simple lorentzian@xcite .",
    "the noise seen in the calculated spectra of the self  energy ( figs.6,7 ) is due to the monte carlo procedure used when each configuration @xmath142 of phonons produces a @xmath143-function and the number of monte carlo runs is finite ( @xmath144 for figs.6,7 ) .",

    "* anomalously strong 2lo phonon satellite *    as mentioned in the introduction , several groups observed apparently phonon  related features in the absorption ( but not in the emission ) spectra of resonantly excited self  assembled qds@xcite .",
    "given the relative weakness of the exciton - phonon interaction in such dots ( @xmath146 ) , the most difficult to explain was the fact that the most intense satellite was not the 1lo phonon sideband but rather the 2lo or 3lo one .",

    "we took a value of @xmath148=55mev , typical of inas / gaas self - assembled qds , and considered two optical phonon modes with the energies of 32 and 30 mev in order to simulate the experimental result of lemaitre _",
    "et al_@xcite .",
    "( the two modes can be interpreted as lo phonon in pure inas and inas - like lo phonon in the ingaas alloy near the qd boundary , respectively ) .",
    "the values of @xmath149 and 0.15 used in this calculation do not look extraordinarily high taking into account the argument presented above ( see eq.([alpha2 ] ) ) and the possible contribution of the optical deformation potential mechanism in this interaction . as it can be seen from fig.9 ,",
    "the second strong absorption peak is _ not _ separated from zpl by the energy @xmath148 and can be called  2lo satellite \" , since the weaker 1lo and 3lo ones also show up in the spectrum .",
    "the calculated spectrum is in a good agreement with the experimental observation of ref.@xcite .    *",
    "homogeneous broadening of absorption lines *    in structures of higher dimensionality , the temperature dependence of the homogeneous linewidth is described by the following relation , @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are some constants and @xmath153 and @xmath154 the bose factors for the acoustic and optical phonons , respectively .",
    "there is no reason for eq.([gamma ] ) be a good approximation for qds , because it relies on the existence of a continuum of electronic states and also is limited to one - phonon scattering processes .",
    "still it was used in @xcite and some other publications to qualitatively describe the dependence @xmath155 extracted from experimental absorption spectra of spherical qds .",
    "it was found that this dependence , in the region from 77 to 300k , is much stronger than linear , similar to that predicted by the second term in eq.([gamma ] ) , suggesting that there is some broadening related to the optical phonons . as it has been pointed out in the introduction ,",
    "interaction of localized electrons with optical phonons produces only additional discrete spectral lines .",
    "consequently , the optical phonon related part of the broadening should not be understood literally , strictly speaking , the broadening occurs only because of the continuum of acoustic phonons .",
    "our calculated fig.8 , where the interaction constants were taken as for a typical spherical cdse qd studied in ref.@xcite , demonstrates this effect .",
    "the interaction with several optical phonon modes results in a series of closely spaced discrete peaks ( see inset in fig.8 ) ) which is camouflaged by the acoustic phonons .",
    "the effective homogeneous broadening of the spectral lines may apparently depend on the equilibrium number of acoustic and optical phonons .",
    "nevertheless , eq.([gamma ] ) is too simple to describe this effect even qualitatively , as found in ref.@xcite using single qd spectroscopy .",
    "owing to the apparent similarity with systems of higher dimensionality , some authors associate the broadening discussed above with the optical phonon  assisted carrier relaxation .",
    "however , as it has been pointed out@xcite , this is not a lifetime ( or irreversible scattering ) effect .",
    "indeed , the polaron states considered here are stationary states",
    ". the phonon - assisted relaxation can probably occur through an anharmonic decay of the phonons participating in the formation of the polaronic states , as suggested in refs.@xcite and calculated in ref.@xcite .",
    "our consideration of the polaron spectrum in the presence of acoustic phonons shows , however , another possibility , namely , the acoustic phonon  mediated transitions between different polaron states owing to the non - diagonal term in ( [ term ] ) .",
    "the next step should consist of analyzing the efficiency of this mechanism .",
    "it is worth noting at this point that , contrary to the opinion of the authors of ref.@xcite , such acoustic phonon - mediated transitions in the polaron spectrum should not be subject to phonon bottleneck , because there are plenty of polaron states due to different optical phonon modes differently coupled to the exciton .",
    "many of them ( which not necessarily show up in the spectra corresponding to thermal equilibrium ) are separated by small energies within the band of acoustic phonons efficiently interacting with the polaron .    * up - converted pl *    the up - converted or anti - stokes photoluminescence ( aspl ) is the emission of photons with energies higher than the excitation energy ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "this effect was observed for colloidal ii - vi qds and discussed in several recent publications@xcite .",
    "additional information can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the aspl occurs when an ensemble of qds is excited at the very edge of the absorption spectrum , below the normal ( i.e. excited with high energy photons ) pl band .",
    "the principal experimental facts concerning this effect are the following :    \\(i ) the aspl intensity increases linearly with the excitation power @xcite , which can be rather low .",
    "\\(ii ) the blue ( anti - stokes ) shift between the aspl peak and @xmath156 does not depend significantly upon the qd size if @xmath156 is chosen proportionally to the absorption peak energy ( which depends upon the size)@xcite .",
    "however , the shift increases with temperature and can range approximately from 20 to 150mev@xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) if @xmath156 increases ( approaching the absorption peak ) the aspl also moves continuously towards higher energies@xcite .",
    "its intensity increases , and finally the spectrum transforms into the normal pl band@xcite .",
    "\\(iv ) the aspl intensity increases strongly with temperature .",
    "possible aspl mechanisms were discussed in refs.@xcite , but no definite conclusion was made . according to ( i ) , processes like two - photon absorption and ( since the possibility of emergence of more than one exciton per qd is negligible ) auger excitation can be excluded in this case .",
    "therefore , it was suggested that incident photons excite electrons to some intermediate sub - gap states from which they eventually proceed to the higher energy ( luminescent ) states through the thermal effect . some obscure surface states ( ss s )",
    "for which , as admitted by the authors of ref.@xcite , there is no any direct evidence , were suggested as those responsible for the sub - gap absorption@xcite .    from our point of view",
    ", the participation of sub - gap ss s ( even if they exist in the passivated colloidal qds ) is unlikely in virtue of the experimental results ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "in fact , it would require the ss s energy have approximately the same dependence on the qd size as that of the confined electronic states in the dots , in obvious contradiction with what should be expected from the general point of view .",
    "at the same time , there exist naturally formed sub - gap states , which are separated from the fundamental absorption line ( i.e. , zpl ) by energies which are only weakly dependent on the qd size .",
    "these are the red - shifted optical phonon replica .",
    "fig.10a presents the lower  energy side of a calculated qd absorption spectrum showing two sub - gap bands ( designated as  -1lo \" and  -2lo \" ) through which the dot can be excited .",
    "the excited qd then will emit a photon most likely having the zpl energy .",
    "the probability of such an up - conversion process increases with temperature because so does the integrated intensity of  -1lo \" and  -2lo \" absorption bands ( shown calculated in fig.10b ) .",
    "the experimental temperature dependence of the aspl intensity measured in ref.@xcite can be understood taking into account that , at a certain temperature , further red  shifted satellites ( whose intensity depends more strongly on the temperature ) become more efficient .",
    "the situation is complicated by the distribution of the qd size , so that @xmath156 can match different ",
    "@xmath157lo \" bands of dots of several different sizes .",
    "this agrees qualitatively with the experimentally observed increase in the anti - stokes shift with temperature@xcite .",
    "modeling of the ensemble effects involved in the aspl phenomenon is beyond the scope of this paper and will be considered in a future work .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that our model explains , at least qualitatively , the principal experimental facts concerning the aspl .    in conclusion",
    ", we proposed a non - perturbative approach for the calculation of the polaronic effects in qds , which allows the consideration of electronic levels coupled through the interaction with several confined phonon modes . using this approach",
    ", we were able to show that the polaronic effects are significant even when the interlevel spacing is quite away from resonance with the optical phonon energies .",
    "we demonstrated that this opens the possibility to account for some previously published and not clearly understood experimental data .",
    "we also presented an explicit calculation of the spectral line shapes because of the diagonal interaction of acoustic phonons with the original electronic levels and suggest that the same interaction may be responsible for relaxation of the polaron entity to lower energies .",
    "this work was supported by the fct ( portugal ) through project fct - pocti / fis/10128/98 , iccti - cnpq ( portugal - brazil ) cooperation program and brazilian agencies cnpq and faperj .",
    "the authors are grateful to s.filonovich for discussions of the aspl and to t.warming for providing the manuscript of ref.@xcite prior to publication .",
    "the following simple model was used to estimate the rates @xmath158 of electron coupling to longitudinal acoustic phonons . assuming that la phonons are completely delocalized , that is , neglecting acoustic impedance at the interface between the qd and matrix , the displacement can be written as @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the density . for the deformation potential interaction mechanism ,",
    "the dimensionless coupling constant is @xcite @xmath161 where @xmath117 is the bulk deformation potential and @xmath162 the electron wavefunction . considering the lowest conduction band state in a spherical qd of radius @xmath163 , with infinite barriers , the wavefunction is @xcite : @xmath164 using these expressions , we obtain @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the longitudinal sound velocity , @xmath167 and @xmath168 is the spherical bessel function . the integral in ( [ integr ] ) can be expressed in terms of the integral sinus as @xmath169\\}.\\ ] ] the function @xmath170 decreases from 1 for @xmath171 to nearly zero for @xmath172 .",
