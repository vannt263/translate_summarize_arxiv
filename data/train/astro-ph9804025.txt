    "a canonical young pulsar ( period @xmath5 ms and stellar dipole field @xmath6 g ) is a rapidly rotating neutron star , created as the stellar remnant during a type ii ( or ib ) supernova explosion of a massive star .",
    "the birthrate of pulsars is known to be close to @xmath7 per century , and it is estimated that there are about @xmath8 active and @xmath9 defunct neutron stars in the galaxy ( see lorimer et al .",
    "1993 and refs . therein ) .    in the last few years ,",
    "there has been growing recognition of a population of ultra - magnetized neutron stars , or `` magnetars '' ( thompson & duncan 1993 ) . the mostly circumstantial evidence comes from investigations of the following categories of objects : the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( thompson & duncan 1995 ; frail et al . 1997 ) , long period pulsars in supernova remnants ( vasisht & gotthelf 1997 and refs . therein ) , other seemingly isolated , young , long period pulsars ( thompson & duncan 1996 ) nowadays referred to as the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axp ; van paradijs et al .",
    "1995 ) , and perhaps their older variants ( kulkarni & van kerkwijk 1998 ) .",
    "these objects share some common properties ; they are steady , bright x - ray sources ( @xmath10 erg s@xmath11 ) which show no signs for an accompanying companion , those with known periods are found to be spinning down , and all are relatively young ( @xmath12 yr - old ) .    the evolutionary consequences of such large dipole fields are reflected in the properties listed above .",
    "most importantly , large braking torques acting on the star cause it to spin - down rapidly , and the magnetic free energy quickly dominates over the rotation energy , i.e. , within several hundred years . for the above sources , the rotation rates lie between 6 - 12 s , with ages @xmath13 yr ( for the sgrs",
    "the evidence for periods is indirect , however , their ages are well constrained due to their association with supernova remnants ) .",
    "it is believed that field decay , which is expected for ultramagnetized neutron stars ( thompson & duncan 1996 ; also goldreich & reisenegger 1992 ) , influences the thermal evolution and powers the large x - ray luminosities observed for the purported magnetars , @xmath10 erg s@xmath11 .",
    "if magnetars represent the tail - end of the magnetic field distribution of neutron stars , then they are bound to be rare .",
    "assume that their birthrate is 10% the birthrate of neutron stars ( some justification for this comes from the estimated birthrates of sgrs ; kulkarni et al .",
    "1994 ) , and that they have active x - ray lifetimes of @xmath14 yr .",
    "these assumptions imply that at present there are only @xmath5 active magnetars in the galaxy , a conclusion that is borne out by the observations of the aforementioned objects .",
    "the fact that we observe the five known axps through large column densities in the galaxy , @xmath15 @xmath2 , suggests that they are indeed that rare , and the fact that they are often associated with supernova remnants or lie near star - formation regions ( in spite of the large random velocities usually attributed to neutron stars ; lyne & lorimer 1994 ) suggests that they are young .",
    "similarly , only two galactic sgrs are known , and it has been suggested that the sgr population census is nearly complete ( kouveliotou 1995 ) .    in summary ,",
    "axps have long rotation periods , hot blackbody - like spectra ( @xmath16 0.5 kev ) with @xmath17 erg s@xmath11 steady luminosities , and have thus far only been observed at x - ray wavelengths .",
    "a search for new axps in the asca database has turned up another candidate , which we refer to as .",
    "the supernova remnant kes75 was observed with the asca observatory ( tanaka et al .",
    "1994 ) on dec 10 , 1993 , as a performance and verification target .",
    "details of the kes75 observation are already published in blanton & helfand ( 1996 ) . herein , we summarize information that is pertinent to the current analysis .",
    "data were acquired by the two gas imaging spectrometers ( gis2 and gis3 ) and collected in the highest time resolution modes ( @xmath18 or @xmath19 depending on data acquisition rate ) .",
    "the gis offers @xmath20 8% @xmath21 spectral resolution over its @xmath22 kev energy band - pass .",
    "each gis sits at the focus of a conical foil mirror and the combination results in a spatial resolution of @xmath23 arcminute ( depending on energy ) over a @xmath24 arcmin diameter active field - of - view . in this report , we concentrate exclusively on the gis data since the target lies outside the field - of - view of the two other focal plane instruments ( the siss ) .",
    "we analyzed data made available from the asca public archive , which were edited to exclude times of high background contamination using the standard screening criteria .",
    "this rejects time intervals of south atlantic anomaly passages , earth occultations , bright earth limb in the field - of - view , and other periods of high particle activity .",
    "an effective exposure of @xmath25 s was obtained with each detector .",
    "event data from both detectors were co - added and the arrival times of each photon corrected to the solar system barycenter .",
    "figure 1 displays a smoothed , flat - fielded , broad - band image of the kes 75 observation , centered on the x - ray bright snr . to the west , at the edge of the gis fov",
    ", we find an unresolved point source @xmath26 , @xmath27 ( j2000 ) .",
    "this source lies far off - axis , roughly @xmath28 from the mean gis optical axis where its flux suffers strong vignetting ; the source is also in a high background region of the detector .",
    "although the source has severe off - axis aberrations and its flux is reduced , the photon limited detection is quite significant , @xmath29 ( see gotthelf & kaspi 1998 for a description of the recipe used to infer the statistical significance ) . due to the off - axis location , and the reduced gis spatial - mode resolution ( @xmath30 pixels ) , the position reconstruction is rather crude and has large uncertainties of order @xmath31 , larger than those for a typical on - axis measurement ( see gotthelf 1994 ) .",
    "our strategy involved a pulsar search in existing asca gis galactic plane fields , to locate candidate axps .",
    "the search was optimized to detect long period ( @xmath32 s ) pulsars for reasons of computational efficiency .",
    "a barycentered light curve was generated at each test location using photons extracted from a @xmath33 aperture , binned in 0.5 s time intervals .",
    "we then used the fast fourier transforms to find significant periodicities in the data . in the gis field containing kes 75 we detected a single , highly significant peak in the fourier power spectral density plot with no overtones , at a period of @xmath34 s. this detection",
    "is centered on the faint source , localized to a few arcmin on to the edge of the gis fov ( see fig 1 ) ; it is not observed anywhere else in the image , making it unlikely to be an instrumental artifact .    in order to refine the pulse period",
    ", we generated a @xmath35 periodogram by folding the timeseries . after extracting 2550 photons , again using a @xmath33 radius aperture centered on the source , and restricting the energy range to @xmath36 kev for optimal sensitivity",
    ", we folded the data into 10 phase bins for each trial period and searched a range of periods within @xmath37 s of the expected period , oversampled with period increments of @xmath38 , were @xmath39 is the test period and @xmath40 the observation duration . the periodogram produced a 14-@xmath41 detection at the period of @xmath42 s ( see figure 2 ) . when the substantial background is taken into account ( see  3 ) , the signal modulation is at 35% amplitude of the mean flux in the @xmath43 radius aperture . in order to verify that the pulsed emission indeed arises from the pointlike source",
    ", we generated an image of the pulsar by subtracting the off - pulse flux from the pulsed emission ( figure 1 ) .",
    "this reveals just the pulsar , at the expected location , and no other significant flux in the image ( contours near kes 75 are artifact of the noisy subtraction in this region ) .",
    "the pulse profile shows no detectable evidence for energy dependence .",
    "given the length of the observation and the source count rate , we were able to segment the data into @xmath44 ks intervals to search for variability in the period over the observation time , but none was found to within the measurement errors of @xmath45 s , implying a period derivative @xmath46 s s@xmath11 ( not terribly constraining ) .",
    "in addition , the light curve is consistent with that of a steady source placed at the edge of the gis fov .",
    "the low frequency spectrum shows no obvious pink noise that is typical of accretion powered sources .",
    "we extracted gis 2 & 3 source and background spectra from a @xmath47 region centered on the pulsar .",
    "a sample background was taken from a nearby off - source region also at the edge of the detector to match the high local background , mainly due to particle interaction with the detector walls .",
    "response matrices were created following the standard procedure and the spectra and responses of the two detectors were co - added .",
    "an absorbed , powerlaw was first used to characterize the spectrum .",
    "the input spectrum was grouped with a minimum of 60 counts per spectral bin , to ensure adequate statistics after background subtraction .",
    "both the galactic plane and instrument backgrounds are substantial , forcing us to restrict the fits to @xmath48 kev , the energy range where the background flux does not dominate the source .",
    "the power - law produced an acceptable fit ( reduced @xmath49 for 25 dof ) , with a steep photon index of @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xmath2 .",
    "the steep index is indicative of the tail of an intrinsically thermal spectrum .",
    "an absorbed blackbody also gives a good fit ( reduced @xmath52 for 25 dof ) with a temperature fit of @xmath53 kev and a somewhat lower absorption , @xmath54 @xmath2 .",
    "the residuals show no evidence for additional emission components .",
    "we deduce the unabsorbed blackbody flux in the @xmath55 kev band to be @xmath56 erg @xmath2 s@xmath11 .",
    "we also fit the on - pulse spectrum directly , using the off - pulse data as a background and thereby derive a slightly harder spectral index of @xmath57 for the on - pulse emission .",
    "this is independent confirmation that our background subtraction was successful and gives a reasonable source spectrum , to within the derived uncertainties .",
    "on the basis of its long rotation period , steady x - ray flux , steep spectral characteristics , and location in the galactic plane ( @xmath58 ) , we classify  as an anomalous x - ray pulsar ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the high foreground absorption suggests that the pulsar is distant , and its line of sight along the tangent to the sagittarius - carina and scutum - crux spiral arms , and the 4-kpc molecular ring justifies its enormous foreground absorption ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "its @xmath59 is roughly twice that of the nearby remnant kes 73 for which quoted distances lie between @xmath60 kpc ( blanton & helfand 1996 ) .",
    "however , the disparity in @xmath59 does not in itself imply a great dissimilarity in distances .",
    "for instance , at 10 kpc the lines of sight vectors to these two objects are already separated by @xmath5 pc , the typical sizes and scale heights of dense giant molecular clouds which are likely to be responsible for most of the absorbing gas . for the purposes of this article we assume the distance to be 15 kpc , an estimate likely to be accurate to within a factor of two .",
    "the steep x - ray spectrum is characteristic of the wien tail of a blackbody radiator . using the best fit blackbody parameters the isotropic x - ray luminosity is @xmath61 erg s@xmath11 , the distance being 15@xmath62 kpc . in effect",
    ", the x - ray pulsations can be ascribed to the viewing of a rotating stellar hotspot of area @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the area of a neutron star of radius 10 km ; this estimate ignores any relativistic corrections to the inferred area .",
    "note that the spectrum is unlike that of any accreting high - mass neutron star binary .",
    "although such binaries have periods in the range 0.07 - 900 s , and sometimes go into low luminosity states with @xmath65 erg s@xmath11 , they generally display very hard spectra ( @xmath66 ) , and show stochastic variability on all time - scales ( nagase 1989 ; koyama et al .",
    "1989 ) as is generally seen in accretion powered sources .",
    "we find no evidence for such variability in our data .    with an axp classification in hand we can compare the properties of  with those of five other members of the axp family in table  1 .",
    "a few years ago schwentker ( 1994 ) reported weak 5-s pulsations from rx j1838.4@xmath670301 which have not yet been confirmed , mereghetti et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have argued that this x - ray source might be due to coronal emission from a late type star .",
    "we , therefore , exclude this source from our list .",
    "although only a future @xmath68 measurement can help determine the linear spindown age of  ( an estimator for the age of an isolated neutron star ) , its location in the galactic plane suggests that it is young , @xmath69 yr .",
    "we consider it extremely likely that the pulsar is associated with one of the several star - formation complexes expected to lie along this line - of - sight ( see fig 4 ) , out to a distance of 20 kpc .",
    "the pulsar lies along a rich region of the galaxy ; there are 10 supernova remnants , several radio pulsars , and the @xmath70-ray source gro j1838@xmath6704 , all within a @xmath71 deg@xmath72 patch of sky surrounding . however , to the best of our knowledge no cataloged sources are associated with it .",
    "we now describe other models that address the unique properties of axps .",
    "it is often noted in the literature , that the inferred accretion rate for the pulsars in table  1 are close to those expected for accretion powered pulsars with field strengths @xmath73  g , spinning at their equilibrium periods @xmath74 ( see bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ) .",
    "this motivated mereghetti & stella ( 1995 ) to suggest that these pulsars are members of a subclass of low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) in equilibrium rotation , with the stellar magnetic field of order @xmath75 g. in contrast , van paradijs et al .",
    "( 1995 ) argue that these objects are isolated neutron stars accreting from a fossil disk , while ghosh et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggest that axps are formed as the result of a thorne-@xmath76ytkov phase of a high mass x - ray binary with strong spherical accretion leading to the soft x - ray spectra with high foreground absorption .",
    "it is worth mentioning that accretion scenarios would be hard - pressed to explain the spin - down age of at least one member of table 1 , the @xmath77 yr of the pulsar in kes  73 ( see table 1 ; gotthelf & vasisht 1997 ) .",
    "first , it is difficult for accretion torques to spin - down a pulsar to 12-s in @xmath78 yr from initial periods @xmath79 ms unless , of course , the pulsar were born a very slow rotator , which is quite interesting in its own right .",
    "secondly , if the pulsar were rotating near its equilibrium period , as in the ghosh and lamb ( 1979 ) scenario , the spin - down time of @xmath80 yr is inconsistent with the luminosity implied accretion rate , @xmath81 m@xmath82 yr@xmath11 ( assuming the pulsar has a standard dipolar field @xmath83 g ) ; these usually lie in range @xmath84 yr .    in conclusion",
    ", further x - ray observations are required to secure the classification of the 7-s pulsar to the growing family of axps - by measuring the long term stability of the x - ray flux , secular trends in the pulse period including doppler modulation , the lack of which will firm up the likelihood against an accreting binary hypothesis .",
    "indeed , if axps are akin to sgrs then they could display sporadic hard x - ray transients , although such behavior is yet to be observed . infrared observations to search for a possible counterpart to  could be carried out in spite the somewhat crude localization ; we mention that past optical / ir searches for counterparts have been unsuccessful .",
    "furthermore , radio observations to uncover an associated supernova remnant could be pursued .",
    "the high foreground absorption could easily cloak the soft x - ray emission of an aged , few@xmath85 yr - old , remnant .",
    "we find it remarkable that the period of  agrees so well with that of 1e  2259 + 586 , although at present we believe this is sheer coincidence .",
