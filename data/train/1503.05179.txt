    "filaments are common structures in molecular clouds ( e.g. ridge et al . 2006 ; andr et al . 2010 , 2013 ; menshchikov et al . 2010 ) .",
    "they are important structures in star formation because most dense cores form within filaments and stars form within dense cores .",
    "studies of isolated dense cores suggest that stars form mainly as a result of gravity within dense cores , but the formation of filaments and the evolution from filaments to dense cores are still unclear .",
    "recent theoretical studies of molecular clouds suggest that a filament may form by colliding flows of turbulent media and some dense parts further undergo contraction by either self - gravity or ram pressure of colliding flows to make dense cores ( e.g. balsara et al .",

    "since filaments are formed through colliding flows in this scenario , young and less massive dense cores within the filaments are gravitationally unbound , while evolved and massive dense cores tend to be gravitationally bound .",
    "thus , observationally studying the physical state of dense cores within filaments with respect to their evolutionary stage is an essential step to understand how low - mass star formation proceeds within filaments .",
    "the taurus molecular cloud is one of the best testbeds for studies of both filaments and dense cores because it is nearby ( d @xmath9 140 pc , loinard et al .",
    "2007 , torres et al . 2009 ) and forming low - mass stars ( no o and b stars ) in a relatively isolated mode ( with little spatially confusion , see review by kenyon , gmez , & whitney 2008 ) .",
    "the l1495-b218 filaments are prominent in the taurus molecular cloud extending over 3 degrees on the sky .",
    "they are known to contain cores that range from chemically young starless cores ( e.g. l1521b and l1521e ; hirota et al .",
    "2004 , tafall & santiago 2004 ) to more evolved protostellar cores ( in b7/l1495 ; see rebull et al .",

    "these maps provide basic information on the structure of the filaments and the positions of some of the densest cores .",
    "hacar & tafalla ( 2013 ) observed the l1495-b218 filaments in c@xmath11o @xmath14 = 1@xmath30 and n@xmath12h@xmath13 @xmath14 = 1@xmath30 .",

    "if the signal to noise ratio is large enough , the uncertainty of a kinetic temperature measured using the inversion transitions of ammonia may be as low as 0.1 k. an accurate measurement of the kinetic temperature also permits an accurate determination of non - thermal motions , making ammonia an excellent tracer for investigating kinematics .",

    "therefore , b7 and b213 are the most evolved regions in the l1495-b218 filaments and b7 is likely to be more evolved than b213 ( see hacar & tafalla et al .",

    "b218 has only one flat spectra protostar embedded within a nh@xmath0 core .",
    "thus , we classify b218 as an evolved region with star formation , although the nh@xmath0 emission is dominated by two bright starless cores .",
    "this region is also sometimes confusingly referred to as b217 ( benson & myers 1989 ) .",
    "we use the notation b218 in this paper since it is closer to the original barnard catalog position of b218 ( kenyon et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "b10 also has only one protostar , which is class ii . in this work",
    ", we assume that b10 is a less evolved region because there is no other protostar except the one class ii protostar which is not directly associated with any dense cores in the region .",
    "in contrast to the other regions , b211 and b216 show weak nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) emission and do not possess any known protostars .",

    "thus , b211 and b216 are both relatively young and inactive parts of the l1495-b218 filaments with b216 likely being the most newly condensed part of the filaments .      to understand the physical properties of nh@xmath0 structures in the l1495-b218 filaments , we fit a simple nh@xmath0 spectra model to the observed spectra and deduce physical quantities including kinetic temperature t@xmath42 , excitation temperature t@xmath43 , total optical depth of nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) emission @xmath44 , dispersion of emission line @xmath45 , and lsr velocity @xmath46 ( see appendix a for details of the fitting algorithm ) .",

    "the gas kinetic temperature ranges from 8 k to 15 k in most of the region mapped . at the bright nh@xmath0 peaks indicated by red arrows , the kinetic temperature decreases toward the core center",
    "the drop in the kinetic temperature is about -1 to -3 k , or about 10% @xmath3 30% of the average kinetic temperature of surroundings .",
    "this temperature drop may ultimately break the dynamical stability of these dense cores and lead them to collapse ( see khesali et al .",

    "one uncertainty may come from a choice of @xmath99 . in this study , we chose median values of @xmath45 within nh@xmath0 leaves but one may use a mean of @xmath45 or a mass - weighted mean of @xmath45 ( mass weighted mean is @xmath106 = @xmath107 ) within a nh@xmath0 leaf .",

    "we estimate the mass of a leaf by simply summing up the column mass of pixels that belongs to the leaf , which corresponds to a cylindrical morphology rather than a spheroidal morphology .",
    "this has been a conventional method to estimate the masses of dense structures since we do not know three dimensional morphologies ( e.g. kirk et al .",

    "this is similar to an infall velocity predicted in a similarity solution of gravitational infall onto a cylinder ( kawachi & hanawa 1998 ) . if we accept that the difference in the lsr velocity is due to relatively isotropic inflow of materials from the molecular cloud to the filaments , the ram pressue due to an inflow motion is @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the density of the best - fit plummer model to the filament ( palmeirim et al .",
    "2013 ) , and @xmath97 is the outer radius of the filament which is 0.4 pc for the b211-b213 regions .",
    "@xmath136 is the difference in the lsr velocity across b211 and b213 regions , which is about 2 km s@xmath27 .",
    "the ram pressure due to the accretion of materials from the molecular cloud to filaments are @xmath133 @xmath137 4.5 @xmath4 10@xmath126 k @xmath17 , which is smaller than the surface pressure estimated from equation ( [ pressure1 ] ) but still within a factor of two .",
    "since there is projection effect in measuring the true inflow velocity , this may be a lower limit of ram pressure due to an inflow motion .",
    "thus , ram pressure due to inflow of materials from the molecular cloud to the filaments may also be one of main sources of pressure that confine gravitationally unbound leaves .",
    "the formation of a filament or a dense core through the gravoturbulence fragmentation scenario predicts that a dense structure may not be strongly aligned with magnetic fields ( nakamura & li 2008 ) unless the magnetic field pressure is considerably stronger than the ram pressure of turbulence .",
    "on the other hand , formation through a quasi - static gravitational contraction may result in a strong alignment of the dense core with magnetic fields because contraction occurs more efficiently along magnetic field lines .",
    "although magnetic field directions are not measured within the nh@xmath0 sources , magnetic field directions on filament scales ( a few 0.1 pc ) have been measured through dust polarization in optical and infrared wavelengths along the l1495-b218 filaments ( chapman et al .",
    "2011 and references therein ) . in b7 and",
    "b10 the magnetic fields are relatively parallel to the long axes of a filament . from b213 to b216 the magnetic fields are perpendicular to the long axes of filaments .",
    "dust polarization in b218 is not measured .",
    "since we do not know the magnetic field directions within dense cores and magnetic field directions are aligned in only some regions , it is difficult to ascertain the role of magnetic field in aligning dense cores .    in the gravoturbulence fragmentation scenario , a dense core forms as an oblate spheroid and",
    "quickly proceeds to a prolate spheroid or triaxial shape ( e.g. gong & ostriker 2011 ; kainulainen et al .",
    "the ratio of oblate dense cores to prolate dense cores depends on the mach number of turbulence and the evolution time .",
    "a system with either a higher mach number or a younger age shows a higher proportion of oblate dense cores .",
    "since the nh@xmath0 leaves are likely to be prolate ( see  3.2.3 ) , the l1495-b218 filaments may have been formed in a low mach number turbulence ( @xmath138 @xmath139 2 ; gong & ostriker 2011 ) if the filaments are formed through the gravoturbulence fragmentation scenario .",
    "the velocity dispersions of filaments in the taurus estimated from @xmath10co observations are indeed low mach number dispersions that range from 0.15 km s@xmath27 to 0.65 km s@xmath27 ( panopoulou et al .",
    "2014 ) , corresponding to mach numbers of 0.65 @xmath3 3.2 , if we take the kinetic temperature of 15 k ( goldsmith et al . 2008 ) . alternatively",
    ", magnetic fields may also make a dense core to have a non - spherical shape because a dense core tends to contract along the magnetic field lines whereas a direction perpendicular to the field is supported by magnetic pressure .",
    "if magnetic pressure is the main force making a dense core s non - spherical shape , the dominant shape is an oblate spheroid ( lizano & shu 1989 ) .",
    "since most of the nh@xmath0 leaves are likely prolate spheroids , magnetic pressure does not seem to be the main cause of shaping a dense core into an elongated morphology , but gravoturbulence fragmentation may have played important roles in shaping the nh@xmath0 leaves .",
    "larson proposed that there is an empirical relation between line width and size of a structure in a cloud scale ( larson 1981 ) . to see whether there is such a relation in a sub - filament scale , we compare the mean velocity dispersion of nh@xmath0 sources with the nh@xmath0 source size in figure [ crel ] .",
    "the velocity dispersion is almost flat on a scale from 0.005 pc to 0.1 pc ( the mean velocity dispersion of molecular gas with @xmath2 = 2.33 is 0.204 km s@xmath27 ) , and it is close to the thermal velocity dispersion ( 0.188 km s@xmath27 at 10 k and @xmath2 = 2.33 ) .",
    "this demonstrates that nonthermal motions are significantly dissipated on scales less than 0.2 pc in the l1495-b218 filaments resulting in a breakdown in the cloud - scale supersonically turbulent scaling relation .",
    "observations toward molecular clouds shows that molecular clouds are supersonic turbulent ( e.g. larson 1981 ; scalo 1984 ; miesch & bally 1994 ; padoan et al .",
