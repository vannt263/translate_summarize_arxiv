    "quantum entanglement , a special quantum correlation , has attracted considerable attention during recent years because many quantum information processes depend on entanglement [ 1 ] .",
    "main difficulty with entanglement is its quantification .",
    "different entanglement measures have been proposed [ 2 , 3 ] .",
    "quantum correlation , one of the key features in quantum information theory , has become an important tool to study quantum many - body systems , for example , quantum phase transition in different correlated systems .",
    "however , the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of such correlations remains an open problem .",
    "so far , several quantifiers of non - classicality of correlations have been introduced in literature [ 4 - 10 ] , but still there is no clear criteria for the faithfulness of them . moreover , for the multipartite states , the geometric measure of entanglement ( gme ) has been proposed [ 11 - 16 ] . the topic attracted due respect in short span of time and bounds on several entanglement measures like von neumann entropy [ 17 ] , negativity [ 18 ] , concurrence [ 19 ] and gme [ 20 , 21 ] were obtained .",
    "recent investigations reveal that there exist quantum correlations other than entanglement .",
    "quantum discord [ 22 , 23 ] quantifies the total non - classical correlations in a quantum state .",
    "it was suggested that the quantum discord , rather than entanglement , is responsible for the efficiency of a quantum computer , which is confirmed both theoretically [ 24 ] and experimentally [ 25 ] . a systematical analysis of quantum and classical correlations for bipartite and multipartite quantum systems",
    "have been proposed by okrasa and walczak [ 26 ] .",
    "quantum discord for the subclass of so - called @xmath0states [ 27 - 30 ] , a qubit - qutrit [ 31 ] and qubit - qudit [ 32 ] systems have also been proposed .",
    "huang et al . [ 33 ] have proposed a new criterion for judging zero quantum discord for arbitrary bipartite states .",
    "yao et al . [ 34 ] have proposed the geometric interpretation of the geometric discord .",
    "the dynamics of quantum discord for a two - qubit system in a quantum spin environment have been proposed by guo et al . [ 35 ] .",
    "recently , discord for multipartite quantum states has been investigated [ 36 - 37 ] and its dynamics under decoherence [ 38 ] .",
    "however , the quantum discord for a general two qubit state remains a nontrivial task and only the lower and upper bounds were investigated [ 39 , 40 ] .",
    "motivated from the difficultly in computing the quantum discord , the geometric measure of quantum discord ( gmqd ) was proposed [ 6 ] , which quantifies the amount of non - classical correlations of a state in terms of its minimal distance from the set of genuinely classical states .",
    "it can be defined as the nearest distance between the given state and the set of zero - discord states .",
    "recently , luo and fu [ 41 , 42 ] have introduced a geometric measure of nonlocality which they termed as measurement - induced nonlocality ( min ) .",
    "it can be defined as the maximum distance between the bipartite state and its post - measurement state , where the maximum is taken over all the von neumann local measurements which do not disturb the local state .",
    "recent investigations in this direction includes [ 43 - 60 ] , where the behaviour of the dynamics of the system is discussed under different scenarios .",
    "furthermore , the dynamics of entanglement at zero and finite temperature has been studied by many authors , for example [ 61 - 63 ] .    the most difficult problem in realizing",
    "the quantum information technology is that the quantum system can never be isolated from the surrounding environment completely .",
    "interactions with the environment deteriorate the purity of the quantum states .",
    "this general phenomenon , known as decoherence [ 64 ] , is a serious obstacle against the preservation of quantum super - positions over long periods of time .",
    "decoherence entails non - unitary evolutions , with serious consequences , like a loss of information and probable leakage toward the environment .",
    "therefore , in a realistic and practical situation , decoherence caused by an external environment is inevitable and the influence of an external environmental system on the entanglement can not be ignored .",
    "however in some cases it can create quantum correlations in the system [ 65 ] .",
    "understanding the dynamics of open quantum systems is of considerable importance .",
    "the schrodinger equation , which describes the evolution of closed systems , is generally inapplicable to open systems , unless one includes the environment in the description .",
    "this is , however , generally difficult , due to the large number of environment degrees of freedom .",
    "an alternative is to develop a description for the evolution of only the subsystem of interest .",
    "much attention has been given to the phenomenon of decoherence that causes an irreversible transfer of information from the system to the environment [ 66 , 67 ] with the special attention to the degradation of entanglement [ 68 - 73 ] .",
    "on the other hand , the behaviour of entanglement in noninertial frames was investigated for the first time by alsing et al . [ 74 ] .",
    "the subject have attracted much attention during recent years [ 75 - 93 ] .",
    "it has also been investigated under decoherence for qubit - qubit [ 94 - 97 ] , qubit - qutrit system [ 98 ] and multipartite systems [ 99 ] .",
    "the entanglement dynamics for noninertial observers in a correlated environment is considered in ref .",
    "[ 100 ] , where it is shown that correlated noise compensates the loss of entanglement caused by the unruh effect .",
    "recently , oliveira et al . [ 101 ] have studied the entanglement measure for pure six - qubit quantum states . whereas zehua and jiliang [ 102 ] have studied how the unruh effect affects the transition between classical and quantum decoherence for a general class of initial states .    in this paper ,",
    "i have investigated the decoherence dynamics of geometric measure of quantum discord and measurement - induced nonlocality at finite temperature for @xmath0-type initial states in relativistic frames .",
    "the two observers alice and bob share an @xmath0-type state in noninertial frames .",
    "alice is considered to be stationary whereas bob moves with a uniform acceleration @xmath3 .",
    "it is shown that initial state entanglement plays an important role in bipartite quantum states .",
    "different decoherence channels are considered parameterized by decoherence parameter @xmath4 such that @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "the lower and upper limits of decoherence parameter represent the fully coherent and fully decohered system , respectively .",
    "whereas , the lower and upper limits of parameter @xmath0 correspond to @xmath6 @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "it is seen that different initial states can be distinguished using gmqd such as the bell diagonal , werner and general type initial states .",
    "it is also seen that the depolarizing channels heavily influences the dynamics of gmqd and min as compared to the amplitude damping channel .",
    "furthermore , no gmqd and min sudden death is seen at finite temperature even in the presence of decoherence .",
    "the evolution of a system and its environment can be described by @xmath8where @xmath9 represents the evolution operator for the combined system and @xmath10 corresponds to the initial state of the environment . by taking trace over the environmental degrees of freedom ,",
    "the evolution of the system can be obtained as@xmath11where @xmath12 represents the orthogonal basis of the environment and @xmath13 is the operator describing the evolution of the system .",

    "( 8) and ( 9 ) , equation ( 7 ) can be re - written in terms of minkowski modes for alice ( @xmath41 ) and rindler modes for bob @xmath42 .",
    "the single - mode approximation is used in this study , i.e. a plane wave minkowski mode is assumed to be the same as a plane wave unruh mode ( superposition of minkowski plane waves with single - mode transformation to rindler modes ) . therefore , alice being an inertial observer while her partner bob who is in uniform acceleration , are considered to carry their detectors sensitive to the @xmath37 mode . to study the entanglement in the state from their perspective",
    "one must transform the unruh modes to rindler modes .",
    "hence , unruh states must be transformed into the rindler basis .",
    "let bob detects a single unruh mode and alice detects a monochromatic minkowski mode of the dirac field .",
    "considering that an accelerated observer in rindler region @xmath39 has no access to the field modes in the causally disconnected region @xmath40 and by taking the trace over the inaccessible modes , one obtains the following density matrix@xmath43where @xmath44 and @xmath45    since noise is a major hurdle while transmitting quantum information from one party to other through classical and quantum channels .",

    "a detailed list of single qubit kraus operators for different quantum channels under consideration is given in table 1 . in order to quantify the quantum correlations , the dynamics of the system - environment interaction",
    "is investigated and only the reduced matrices are considered .",
    "it is assumed that both alice and bob s qubits are influenced by the environment .",
    "the reduced - density matrix of the inertial subsystem @xmath41 and the noninertial subsystem @xmath49 , can be obtained by taking the partial trace of @xmath50  over the degrees of freedom of the environment i.e. @xmath51",
    "let us consider a two - qubit system ( two two - level atoms ) is interacting with a thermal reservoir . unlike the ref . [ 103 ] , where the authors studied the system at @xmath52 , in the present scheme , the effect of heat is included .",
