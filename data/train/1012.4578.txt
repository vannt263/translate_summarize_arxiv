    "states of light with spatially inhomogeneous polarization structure , such as the radially or azimuthally polarized vector beams @xcite , have lately attracted major attention both in the theoretical and experimental area of research in optics @xcite . as devices for their generation",

    "this means , these vector beams can be sharply focussed in the center of the optical axis and therefore find applications in lithography , confocal microscopy @xcite , optical trapping and tweezing @xcite as well as material processing @xcite .",
    "moreover , one can gain detailed insight into nanoscale physics due to the intrinsic strong polarization dependence of these beams @xcite . in the quantum regime ,",
    "specially designed spatio - polarization modes can increase the coupling to single ions @xcite .",
    "additionally , the related orbital angular momentum states help to investigate entanglement @xcite .",
    "very recently it has been shown that by quadrature squeezing an azimuthally polarized optical beam , one can generate quantum states exhibiting _ hybrid _ entanglement between the spatial and the polarization degrees of freedom @xcite .    in this work",
    "we aim at establishing a proper theoretical framework for the classical optics description of cylindrically polarized modes ( cpms ) of the electro - magnetic field .",
    "we cover the subtleties in terms of their description , highlight their symmetry properties and determine their total angular momentum .",
    "finally , we show a suitable way of constructing a reasonable tool of displaying these modes on a defined pair of poincar spheres . in particular , in sec . 1",
    ", we illustrate the rotation principles underlying the intrinsic _ cylindrical _ polarization of the investigated beams .",
    "we introduce all possible configurations of these modes and calculate the schmidt rank , as this is a convincing way to determine the potential inseparability of these modes .",
    "we complete the theoretical investigation by deducing the total angular momentum of these cpms in sec .",
    "3 . in sec . 4",
    ", we introduce our poincar sphere representation for the hybrid polarization / spatial degrees of freedom characterizing cpms . in sec . 5",
    ", we discuss the manipulations of these states of light on these hybrid poincar spheres with the help of conventional phase retarders .",
    "furthermore , in sec . 6 , we extend our formalism to the quantum domain and illustrate the importance of these modes in quantum experiments .",
    "finally , in the appendix , we furnish the reader with the mathematical tools which are essential to fully cover the topics of the main text .",

    "each of these two pairs of states represent a novel kind of _ hybrid _ dof of the electromagnetic field , since such states describe neither purely polarized nor purely spatial modes of the field .",
    "mathematically , the combination of the smps and the pps is realized by forming the four dimensional basis given by the cartesian product of the the spatial mode @xmath205 and polarization @xmath206 bases : @xmath207 to span this four dimensional space , we choose the basis @xmath104 .",
    "as it was shown above , these two sets of vector functions , namely the `` @xmath69 '' and `` @xmath110 '' ones , do not mix under rotation and , moreover , obey the two fundamental rotation laws in eqs .",
