    "while up , down and strange quarks may be treated as being effectively massless partons , the heavy quarks , charm @xmath2 , bottom @xmath3 , top @xmath4 , must have their mass , @xmath5 taken into account in any qcd calculations . in particular",
    "it is essential to treat charm and bottom correctly in global fits for parton distributions .",
    "there are two distinct regimes that can be considered . near threshold , @xmath6 ,",
    "massive quarks are not treated as parton constituents of the proton but are created in the final state .",
    "any processes may be described using the fixed - flavour number scheme ( ffns ) .",
    "for example , structure functions are given by f(x , q^2)=c^ff_k(q^2/m_h^2,q^2/^2)f^n_f_k(^2 ) , up to higher twist @xmath7 corrections , where @xmath8 is the number of light partons and all the mass dependence is in the hard coefficient functions which have been calculated up to nlo ( i.e. @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "this is reliable for scales not much greater than @xmath10 , but increasing orders in @xmath0 contain increasing logarithms in @xmath11 , and order - by - order perturbation theory is not guaranteed to be accurate .",
    "also , the ffns coefficient functions are not known yet at nnlo , rendering an nnlo ffns impossible to define .    at high scales ,",
    "i.e. @xmath12 , the heavy quarks are expected to behave like massless partons .",
    "the heavy quark is treated like the other partons and @xmath13 terms are then automatically summed via evolution .",
    "the simplest approach is the zero mass variable - flavour number scheme ( zmvfns ) @xcite .",
    "this ignores all @xmath14 corrections for each of the @xmath15 heavy quarks , and the structure functions are given by f(x , q^2 ) = c^zmvf_j(q^2/^2)f^n_f+n_h_j(^2 ) , where the hard coefficient functions are mass independent .",
    "although this is called a `` scheme '' it is important to note that unlike usual scheme definitions , which are alternative ways to order the perturbative series , the zmvfns is incorrect by terms of @xmath14 , and is really only an approximation in the region @xmath16 .",
    "the approximation in this region may indeed be very important in practice , as i will demonstrate later .",
    "a correct variable - flavour number scheme should not have these inaccuracies , but should correct the coefficient functions for the mass effects .",
    "as we go from an @xmath8-flavour to an @xmath17-flavour scheme , the partons in the different number regions are related to each other perturbatively , f^n_f+1_j(^2)= a_jk(^2/m_h^2 ) f^n_f_k(^2 ) , where the perturbative matrix elements @xmath18 contain the @xmath13 terms which relate @xmath19 and @xmath20 and lead to the correct evolution for both .",
    "there is then a similar relationship as we go from an @xmath17-flavour to an @xmath21-flavour scheme , but i will consider the transitions one at a time in this paper . at the bottom quark transition point @xmath8",
    "is effectively equal to 4 , i.e. the charm quark is already evolving like a massless partons below this point .",
    "= 0.42 = 0.42    [ fig : disc ]    at lo , i.e. zeroth order in @xmath0 , the relationship is trivial , q(g)^n_f+1_k(^2)q(g)^n_f_k(^2 ) . at nlo ,",
    "i.e. first order in @xmath0 , the non - trivial contributions are ( h+|h)(^2)= p^0_qg g^n_f(q^2)(^2/m_h^2 ) , g^n_f+1(^2)= ( 1-(^2/m_h^2))g^n_f(^2 ) , [ eq : lomatrix ] where @xmath22 is the heavy quark parton distribution .",
    "hence , the heavy flavour evolves from zero at @xmath23 according to standard massless quark evolution and the gluon loses corresponding momentum .",
    "it is natural to choose @xmath23 as the transition point from the @xmath8-flavour to the @xmath17-flavour scheme , since at this order the partons are then continuous and the heavy quark starts evolving from a zero value . at nnlo ,",
    "i.e. second order in @xmath0 , there is much more complication f_i , nnlo^n_f+1(^2)= ( ) ^2 _ ij ( a^2,0_ij+a^2,1_ij(^2/m_h^2)+a^2,2_ij^2(^2/m_h^2 ) ) f_j^n_f(^2 ) , where the @xmath24 @xcite are generally nonzero .",
    "there is no longer any possibility of a smooth transition at @xmath23 .",
    "since each of the @xmath25 is a different function there is no smooth turn on of the flavour distribution at any alternative value of @xmath26 , hence , for technical simplicity , it seems sensible to keep the transition point at @xmath23 , though any other point can be chosen if desired . making this choice it turns out that @xmath27 , the matrix element giving the gluon contribution to the heavy quark distribution , is negative at small @xmath28 , even though the structure function is always positive , and the heavy quark starts evolving from a negative value in the @xmath29 scheme .",
    "this highlights the fact that parton distributions are not physical quantities .",
    "however , it also illustrates a major problem with the zero - mass variable - flavour number scheme .    in order to make a concrete illustration of the effect we must choose a factorization and renormalization scale . for light partons both of these",
    "are conventionally chosen to be @xmath30 .",
    "it is most natural to place the heavy flavour on the same footing , and choose the same scale , e.g. it is difficult to think of momentum conservation at a given scale if the factorization scale is different for different partons .",
    "hence , for the remainder of this article i will set @xmath30 .",
    "having made a choice , we see that in the zmvfns the coefficient functions already lead to a discontinuity in the structure functions at nlo , i.e. f_2^h(x , q^2 ) & = & 0 q^2 < m_h^2 , + & = & c_2,gg^n_f+1(q^2 ) q^2>m_h^2 .",
    "however , this is a very small effect at nlo . it is larger at nnlo , since the coefficient function makes a larger contribution , even though it is nominally of higher order , and it is negative at smallish @xmath28 ( @xmath31 ) , as is the starting value of the partons",
    "hence , @xmath32 is also negative for @xmath33 .",
    "this shows that the zmvfns is not really feasible at nnlo .",
    "it leads to huge discontinuities in the charm structure function @xmath34 , and even significant discontinuities in the total structure function @xmath35 .",
    "these are shown in fig.[fig : disc ] , where a small discontinuity in @xmath35 at @xmath36 is also seen .",
    "this is a measure of the mistake made in omitting the @xmath14 corrections in this approximate `` scheme '' .",
    "one really needs a general variable - flavour number scheme ( vfns ) joining the two well - defined limits of @xmath37 and @xmath38 in a theoretically correct manner .",
    "we will outline such a scheme , which has been implemented explicitly up to nnlo , in the remainder of this article .",
    "a correct vfns can be defined by demanding equivalence of the @xmath39 ( ffns ) and @xmath17-flavour descriptions at all orders , i.e. f(x , q^2)&=&c^ff_k(q^2/m_h^2,q^2/^2)f^n_f_k(^2)= c^vf_j(q^2/m_h^2,q^2/^2)f^n_f+1_j(^2 ) + & & c^vf_j(q^2/m_h^2,q^2/^2 ) a_jk(^2/m_h^2)f^n_f_k(^2 ) .",
    "hence , the vfns coefficient functions have to satisfy c^ff_k(q^2/m_h^2,q^2/^2 ) = c^vf_j(q^2/m_h^2,q^2/^2)a_jk(^2/m_h^2 ) , [ eq : general ] at all orders .",
    "it is important to remember that the left - hand side of this expression is expanded in the @xmath8-flavour coupling @xmath40 , while the right - hand side is most naturally expanded in the @xmath17-flavour coupling @xmath41 .",
    "the two are related by _",
    "s , n_f+1(^2)=_s , n_f+ ( ^2/m_h^2)^2_s , n_f + o(^3_s , n_f).[eq : couplings ] the coupling is therefore continuous up to @xmath42 , but at @xmath43 there is a small discontinuity .",
    "this discontinuity does not influence the vfns up to nnlo .    at @xmath44 eq.([eq : general ] ) becomes , for example , for the structure function @xmath35 c^ff,1_2,g(q^2/m_h^2 ) = c^vf,0_2 , hh(q^2/m_h^2)p^0_qg(^2/m_h^2)+ c^vf,1_2,g(q^2/m_h^2,q^2/^2),[eq : lo ] the vfns coefficient functions automatically tend to the massless limits as @xmath45 @xcite and , if we use the zeroth order cross - section for photon - heavy quark scattering , c^vf,0_2 , hh(q^2/m_h^2,z)=(1 + 4m_h^2/q^2 ) ( z-1/(1+m_h^2/q^2 ) ) , this is the original acot scheme @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath46 ( we set @xmath30 explicitly for simplicity ) is only uniquely defined in the massless limit @xmath45",
    ". one can swap @xmath14 terms between @xmath47 and @xmath48 while still satisfying eq.([eq : lo ] ) , i.e. @xmath47 is not uniquely defined .",
    "this is true for all @xmath49 .",
    "the original acot prescription removed the ambiguity by defining @xmath46 as the calculated coefficient function for an incoming massive quark .",
    "however , this violates the physical production threshold @xmath50 since it only needs one quark in the final state rather than a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "hence , there is not a smooth transition at @xmath33 as @xmath51 .",
    "the thorne - roberts variable - flavour number scheme ( tr - vfns ) first recognized this ambiguity in the definition of @xmath47 @xcite and removed it by imposition of the physically motivated constraint of @xmath52 being continuous at the transition point @xmath33 ( in the gluon sector ) .",
    "hence , it guaranteed smoothness at @xmath33 , but the approach to @xmath45 is a little odd  the vfns result overshooting the zero mass result before approaching it asymptotically from above .",
    "this effect diminishes at higher orders but more of a problem is the complicated form of the scheme ",
    "@xmath53 , which is not a simple function .",
    "this makes the scheme very involved at higher orders and it is also not well suited to charged currents @xcite .",
    "there have been various other alternatives since this .",
    "most recently tung , kretzer and schmidt have devised the acot(@xmath1 ) prescription @xcite which may be interpreted as c^vf,0_2 , hh(q^2/m_h^2,z)&= & ( z - q^2/(q^2 + 4m_h^2 ) ) , + f^h,0_2(x , q^2)&=&(h+|h)(x / x_max , q^2 ) , x_max= q^2/(q^2 + 4m_h^2 ) .",
    "hence , the zeroth - order coefficient function tends to the standard @xmath54 for @xmath45 but respects the threshold requirement @xmath55 for quark - antiquark production .",
    "moreover , it is very simple . for the vfns to remain simple ( and physically motivated ) at all orders @xmath56 in @xmath0",
    "it is necessary to choose c^vf , n_2 , hh(q^2/m_h^2,z)= c^zm , n_2 , hh(z / x_max ) .",
    "[ eq : twodef ] it is also important to choose c^vf , n_l , hh(q^2/m_h^2,z)c^zm , n_l , hh(z / x_max ) , and to impose the condition that @xmath57 ( as is done in @xcite ) , despite the fact that one obtains c^0_l , hh(q^2/m_h^2,z ) = 4z ( z-1/(1+m_h^2/q^2 ) ) for single quark - photon scattering . because the heavy - flavour contribution to @xmath58 is highly suppressed at low values of @xmath59 , compared to that for @xmath35 , we choose c^vf , n_l , hh(q^2/m_h^2,z)= ( - ) c^zm , n_l , hh(z / x_max ) .",

    "= 0.7    [ fig : order ]    there is one more problem in defining the vfns .",
    "the ordering for @xmath74 is different for the @xmath8 and @xmath17 regions .",
    "this can be illustrated by the following table which shows the order by order expressions both below and above the transition point .",
    "the issue is that the series expansion begins at zeroth order above the transition point , where there is a heavy flavour distribution , but at @xmath44 below the transition point .",
    "hence , what is meant by lo , nlo _ etc .",
    "_ is different by one power of @xmath0 as one changes the number of active quark flavours .",
    "therefore , making the transition directly from a given fixed order to the same relative order when going from @xmath8 to @xmath17 flavours leads to a different order in @xmath0 and discontinuities which may be rather significant for example , lo is nonzero as one approaches the transition point from below , but zero when approaching it from above .",
    "one must make some decision on how to deal with this problem .",
    "up to now acot have used the same order of @xmath0 above and below the transition point , e.g. at nlo c^ff,1_2 , hgg^n_f c^vf,0_2 , hh(h+|h ) + ( c^vf,1_2 , hh(h+|h ) + c^ff,1_2 , hgg^n_f+1 ) .",
    "the structure function is then automatically continuous .",

    "@xmath77 contains only information on @xmath78 , not on @xmath79  and nlo evolution above it .",
    "hence the slope @xmath80 is discontinuous .",
    "the thorne - roberts scheme used the same relative order above and below the transition point , but added a uniquely determined @xmath59-independent term above the transition point to maintain continuity of the structure function .",

    "this difference in choice is extremely important at low @xmath59 ( if using @xmath81 ) , as is illustrated in fig.[fig : order ] which compares the two choices at nlo .",
    "the @xmath9 part is dominant at low @xmath28 for @xmath82 because the @xmath9 coefficient functions diverge at small @xmath28 whereas the @xmath44 coefficient function is finite in this limit .",
    "indeed , the `` frozen '' part is very significant for @xmath83 .",
    "its inclusion clearly improves the match to the data @xcite .",
    "it is also clear that switching from the standard @xmath8-flavour nlo to the standard @xmath17-flavour nlo would lead to a large discontinuity in @xmath32 .",
    "hence we choose to continue using the thorne - roberts approach for the matching at the transition point .",
    "however , this is a place where there is a definite freedom of choice , and there are various possibilities available .",
    "= 0.7    [ fig : comp ]    with the type of choice made for the definition of the heavy flavour coefficient functions @xmath84 in eq.([eq : ldef ] ) there is no problem with ordering across the transition point for the longitudinal structure function .",
    "this is because both the ffns and vfns coefficient functions begin at @xmath44 for both the gluon and heavy quarks .",
    "it is possible to choose a non - vanishing value for @xmath85 , and indeed some vfns definitions do so , but this is contrary to the spirit of this approach , and will lead to extra complications .    in order to define fully the vfns at nnlo",
    ", this choice for ordering above and below the transition point means that we need the @xmath69 heavy - flavour coefficient functions for @xmath86 and that the contribution from these should be frozen for @xmath87 .",
    "however , these coefficient functions are not yet known .",
    "nevertheless , we do know the leading threshold logarithms @xcite , i.e. the leading contribution for @xmath88 not much above @xmath61 .",
    "this is given by c^ff,3 , thresh_2 , hg(q^2/m_h^2,z ) ~ ( , q^2/m_h^2 ) , = -1 , [ eq : thresh ] i.e. @xmath89 at threshold and @xmath90 as @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath91 is a function which models the contribution from the dominant threshold logarithms .",
    "this contribution occurs only in the gluon sector .",
    "= 0.6    [ fig : bottom ]    we can also derive the leading @xmath92 term from @xmath93-dependent impact factors derived by catani , ciafaloni and hautmann @xcite . with a little work these can be shown to give c^ff,3 , low x_2 , hg(q^2/m_h^2,z ) = 96 _ 2(q^2/m_h^2 ) , where @xmath94 may be calculated and @xmath95 .",
    "we also know that in this small-@xmath28 limit @xmath96 . by analogy with the known nnlo coefficient functions and splitting functions it is reasonable to propose that this be modified to c^ff,3 , low x_2 , hg(q^2/m_h^2,z ) = ( ( 1/z)-4 ) ( 1-z / x_max)^20 _ 2(q^2/m_h^2 ) .",

    "the leading @xmath99 is accompanied by @xmath100 , i.e. a @xmath101 term of similar size to that in other known coefficient functions and splitting functions is introduced .",
    "finally , the effect of the this entire small @xmath102 term is damped as @xmath103 by the large power of @xmath104 .",
    "the power of @xmath105 is chosen in order to make the contribution in eq.([eq : asymp2 ] ) very suppressed until @xmath106 , which is in line with the values of @xmath28 above which the small-@xmath28 divergent terms tend to be suppressed in the complete nnlo splitting functions @xcite .",
    "the total approximate nnlo coefficient function is obtained by adding the contributions in eq.([eq : thresh ] ) and eq.([eq : asymp2 ] ) the amount of information is similar to ( though a little weaker than ) that used previously to derive approximate nnlo splitting functions @xcite , which turned out to be a very good approximation once the exact expressions became known .",
    "these expressions could also be used to provide an approximate nnlo ffns definition . however , in this case they would have to be used over a far wider range of @xmath59 , rather than the small range here .",
    "in particular the frozen nnlo contribution becomes a proportionally very small contribution to the total @xmath74 at high @xmath59 , whereas there is no reason to believe the @xmath69 contribution in the ffns is small since it contains terms of order @xmath107 .",
    "the nnlo ffns would therefore be more genuinely approximate . for @xmath62 we can approximate the @xmath69 coefficient functions at @xmath37 using the same approach .",
    "in this case there is no large threshold contribution and the small-@xmath28 contribution is estimated to be c^ff,3 , low x_l , hg(q^2/m_h^2,z ) = ^3((1/z)-4 ) ( 1-z / x_max)^20 _ l(q^2/m_h^2 ) , [ eq : asympl ] where @xmath108 and the @xmath109 reflects the fact that the longitudinal heavy - flavour coefficients are much more suppressed near threshold . for the vfns for",

    "the degree of modelling and approximation is far less than in a nnlo ffns .    using these approximate @xmath69 coefficient functions one can produce full nnlo predictions for structure functions with discontinuous partons and coefficient functions but continuous @xmath113 .",
    "the results are not very sensitive to the choices made in this approximation , as long as they are within a sensible range .",
    "note also that the definition of the vfns , relying only on eq.([eq : general ] ) , eq.([eq : twodef ] ) , eq.([eq : ldef ] ) and the ordering across the transition point , may be straightforwardly generalised to any choice of factorization and renormalization scales .",
    "for the simplest choice of @xmath30 the nnlo corrections are seen in fig.[fig : comp ] .",
    "they clearly improve the match to the lowest @xmath59 data , where nlo is always too low .",
    "this large increase at low @xmath28 is because the nnlo coefficient functions are more divergent than the nlo coefficient functions .",
    "the comparison with the recent bottom quark production data @xcite from h1 is also shown in fig.[fig : bottom ] .. the gluons from this new fit are exhibited in fig.3 of @xcite , and are more negative than our previous , approximate nnlo partons at low @xmath59 and very small @xmath28 . ] the agreement is good , but one can clearly see that the slope @xmath114 is smaller at nnlo than at nlo , and the same is true for charm . this is because one is interpolating from a higher value at low @xmath59 , due to the nnlo coefficient function contribution , to lower values at high @xmath59 , where the quark content is dominant and has a relative reduction compared to nlo because the evolution has started from a negative value rather than zero .",

    "s^2 ^ 2(q^2/m_h^2 ) ( ) q(x , q^2 ) & = & _",
    "s^2 ^ 3(q^2/m_h^2)q(x , q^2 ) + & & + _ s^2 ^ 2(q^2/m_h^2 ) ( ) _ + q(x , q^2 ) + o(^2(q^2/m_h^2 ) ) .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath102 in the convolution is @xmath121 so the divergence at @xmath122 is not reached .",
    "however , the convolution on the left - hand side does produce an additional power of @xmath123 .",
    "the @xmath107 contributions then cancel exactly with contributions from terms of the form @xmath124 in the coefficient functions from the type of diagrams on the left - hand side , leaving the remainder , including the `` @xmath119''-distributions .",
    "this is an added complication compared to the case where the heavy quark appears at the photon vertex , requiring particular care in a numerical implementation of the vfns .",
    "however , it is only really a technical problem rather than producing any fundamentally new features . in the light - flavour sector",
    "there is no problem with ordering .",
    "the light - flavour contribution to @xmath35 begins at zeroth order in the ffns and vfns .",
    "furthermore , if one is being totally correct , the left - hand type diagram and the soft parts of the right - hand type diagram should contribute to the light - flavour structure function , and the hard part of the right - hand type diagram contributes to @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "this can be implemented ( it depends on a separation parameter , determining `` hard '' and `` soft '' ) , but each contribution is in practice tiny . at the moment we include all such contributions in the light flavours .",
    "this leads to a very small underestimate of the heavy - flavour structure functions .",
    "the vfns works , in principle , in much the same way for charged currents . the zeroth - order coefficient function for single ( anti)charm production from a ( anti)strange quark is now c^vf,0_2 , sc(q^2/m_c^2,z)= ( z - q^2/(q^2+m_c^2 ) ) , i.e. the threshold is now for a single heavy quark production .",
    "the same is obviously true for ( anti)charm production from a ( anti)down quark .",
    "this is far simpler than the prescription in @xcite . at higher orders the generalization is again trivial . using the acot(@xmath1 ) reasoning one simply uses the light coefficient function with argument @xmath102 replaced by @xmath125 .",
    "however , there is a major problem in defining the full vfns , even at nlo .",
    "the ffns coefficient functions are calculated at @xmath44 @xcite but are not yet calculated exactly at @xmath9 for the charged - current case .",
    "limit in @xcite . ]",
    "the generalization from the neutral current case is not simple because the divergences in the final state are different , i.e. one more particle is massless and regularized by dimensional regularization , and one fewer is regularized by the mass .",
    "hence , in defining the vfns for the charged current case it is necessary to make an approximation . in practice",
    "we have used the @xmath9 neutral current cross - sections but altered the threshold dependence in all expressions so that all dependence on @xmath126 is replaced by dependence on @xmath127 .",
    "this guarantees that all terms respect the true kinematic threshold .",
    "the approximation occurs mainly at low @xmath59 where the @xmath9 ffns coefficient functions are most important in the vfns .",
    "this is not peculiar to this definition of a vfns , but will be present in any current approach . and will have incorrect kinematic thresholds , whereas the approximation here is guaranteed to have the correct general form . ]",
    "there is an uncertainty at low @xmath59 at @xmath9 that can only be removed by an explicit calculation . at higher @xmath59",
    "the vfns tends to the zero - mass limit for all coefficient functions , so all expressions become exact .",
    "hence the hera charged current data are very insensitive indeed to the approximation .",
    "the charged current data at low @xmath59 only exist down to @xmath128 , much higher than for the neutral current hera data , and at low @xmath59 and high-@xmath28 heavy - flavour production is very small . hence any errors in the approximation are not very important phenomenologically .",
    "there are discontinuities in both the parton distributions and the coefficient functions at nnlo .",
    "this makes a variable - flavour number scheme more necessary than ever .",
    "the zmvfns is badly discontinuous at the transition point @xmath33 , and the ffns is only approximate at nnlo .",
    "a generalization of the acot(@xmath1 ) prescription leads to a physically sensible and simple vfns , in principle defined to all orders .",
    "one must still be careful about matching when going across the transition point of @xmath33 .",
    "if this matching is done properly it guarantees the continuity of the physical structure functions and maximises the smoothness of the function .",
    "we choose the thorne - roberts method of matching above and below the transition , i.e. choose the correct order for the region of @xmath8 flavours and add an additional , uniquely defined constant for the region of @xmath17 flavours to guarantee continuity .",
    "this choice is significant and leads to a much better match to the low @xmath59 data .",
    "we have devised an explicit , full nnlo vfns for @xmath35 and @xmath58 , with a small amount of necessary modelling of nnlo fixed - flavour coefficient functions .",
    "the nnlo variable - flavour number scheme seems to improve the fit to lowest @xmath28 and @xmath59 data greatly and is not very sensitive to this modelling . it is essential to use such an nnlo vfns in nnlo global analysis of data , and indeed the construction of the nnlo vfns makes such a precise analysis possible @xcite .",
