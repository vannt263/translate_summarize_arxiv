    "reliable chemical abundance determinations are essential for a wide variety of investigations of galaxies and their evolution . for example , on global scales they are one of the key parameters in the study of the luminosity - metallicity and mass - metallicity relations of galaxies , their evolution with time , and their dependence on environment or star formation rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the metallicity of star - forming galaxies at the present epoch can be estimated from the emission - line spectra of hii regions , which are easily obtained even over greater distances .",
    "it is believed that the direct @xmath7 method ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides the most reliable abundance determinations in hii regions .",
    "abundance determinations through the direct @xmath7 method require high - precision spectroscopy of hii regions in order to detect the weak auroral lines such as [ oiii]@xmath104363 or / and [ nii]@xmath105755 .",
    "unfortunately , these auroral lines are often rather faint and thus may be detected only in the spectra of a limited number of hii regions .",
    "the abundances in other hii regions are then usually estimated through the method suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the idea of this method ( traditionally called the strong - line method ) is to establish the relation between the ( oxygen ) abundance in an hii region and some combination of the intensities of strong emission lines in its spectrum , i.e. , the combination of the intensities of these strong lines is calibrated in terms of the metallicity of the hii region .",
    "therefore , such a relation is usually called a `` calibration '' and serves to convert metallicity - sensitive emission - line combinations into metallicity estimations .",
    "numerous calibrations based on the emission lines of different elements were suggested ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among many others ) .",
    "a prominent characteristic of all the calibrations is that there is no unique relation that is applicable across the whole range of metallicities of hii regions . instead",
    ", a calibration relation for a limited range of metallicities or distinct calibration relations for different intervals of metallicities ( usually at high or at low metallicities ) are constructed .",
    "one has to know _ a priori _ to which interval of metallicity the hii region belongs in order to choose the relevant calibration relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this can result in a wrong choice of the calibration relation and , as a consequence , in large uncertainties in the abundances of the hii regions .",
    "this problem is particularly difficult for hii regions that lie near the boundary of the applicability of the calibration relation .",
    "the most important characteristic of the calibration is a sample of calibrating data points to be used in the construction of the calibration relation .",
    "grids of photoionization models of hii regions can be used to establish a relation between strong - line intensities and oxygen abundances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such calibrations are usually referred to as theoretical or model calibrations . on the other hand ,",
    "a sample of hii regions in which the oxygen abundances are determined through the direct @xmath7 method can serve as basis of a calibration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such calibrations are usually called empirical calibrations .",
    "there are also a hybrid calibrations where both the hii regions with directly measured abundances and the photoionization models of hii regions are used ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there are large systematic discrepancies between the abundance values produced by different published calibrations .",
    "the theoretical ( or model ) calibrations generally produce oxygen abundances that are by factors of 1.5 to 5 higher than those derived through the direct @xmath7 method or through empirical calibrations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , at the present time there is no absolute scale for metallicities of hii regions .",
    "the empirical calibrations have advantages as compared to the theoretical calibrations .",
    "the empirical metallicity scale is well defined in terms of the abundances in hii regions derived through the direct @xmath11 method , i.e. , in that sense the empirical metallicity scale is absolute .",
    "the abundances in hii regions obtained through the different empirical calibrations are compatible with each other as well as with the direct @xmath11-based abundances .",
    "the empirical metallicity scale is likely the preferable metallicity scale at present .",
    "the construction of an empirical calibration encounters the following difficulty .",
    "not all direct abundances are of high precision since the measurements of the weak auroral lines can involve considerable errors",
    ". therefore the choice of a sample of hii regions with reliable abundances is not a trivial task .",
    "we recently suggested a new method ( the `` c method '' ) for abundance determinations in hii regions , which can be used over the whole range of metallicities of hii regions and which provides oxygen and nitrogen abundances on the same metallicity scale as the classical @xmath7 method @xcite .",
    "it is important that the @xmath6 method allows one to choose a sample of hii regions with reliable @xmath7-based abundances @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present study is to establish simple calibration relations that provide the oxygen and nitrogen abundance determinations over the whole range of hii region metallicities with relative errors less than 0.1 dex .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the sample of calibrating data points is reported in section 2 .",
    "the calibration relations are constructed in section 3 .",
    "the discussion is given in section 4 , followed by a summary ( section 5 ) .    throughout the paper",

    "the notation ( o / h)@xmath23 = 12 + log(o / h ) will be used in order to permit us to write our equations in a compact way .",
    "it was noted above that the choice of a sample of hii regions with reliable abundance determinations is not a trivial task . such a sample was compiled in the framework of the @xmath6 method for abundance determinations in hii regions @xcite .",
    "this selection of reference hii regions is based on the idea that if an hii region belongs to the sequence of photoionized nebulae , and its line intensities are measured accurately , then different methods based on different emission lines should yield similar physical characteristics ( such as electron temperatures and abundances ) for a given object @xcite .",
    "the original compilation of reference hii region spectra with detected auroral lines ( and , consequently , with @xmath7-based abundances ) that was created in @xcite has been updated by adding more recent measurements of hii regions .",
    "the latest version of the collection includes 965 @xmath7-based abundances . using those data we select a sample of reference hii regions for which all absolute differences in their oxygen abundances ( o / h)@xmath24  ( o / h)@xmath25 and ( o / h)@xmath26  ( o / h)@xmath25 and nitrogen abundances ( n / h)@xmath24  ( n / h)@xmath25 and ( n / h)@xmath26  ( n / h)@xmath25 are less than 0.1 dex .",
    "this sample of reference hii regions contains 313 objects @xcite and will be used as calibrating data set in the present study .",

    "the validity and reliability of the calibration - based abundances can be addressed on three levels .",
    "firstly , the accuracy of the calibration relations depend on the number and quality of the calibrating data points .",
    "[ figure : gistxhe ] shows that the number of the reference hii regions at high metallicities is relatively small .",
    "as was noted earlier , new high precision measurements of hii regions , especially at high metallicities , would be desirable to increase the reliability of the calibration - based abundances .",
    "the abundances in hii regions provided by the suggested calibration relations are in agreement with the @xmath7-based abundances within 0.1 dex , i.e. , the relative accuracy of the calibration - based abundances are within 0.1 dex .",
    "there is no systematic discrepancy between calibration - based and @xmath7-based abundances .",
    "therefore , the validity of the absolute calibration - based abundances ( the potential systematic error ) is , in fact , determined by the validity of the @xmath7-based metallicity scale for hii regions .    secondly , there is a discrepancy between the values of the abundance of a given hii region derived through the @xmath7 method and via the model fitting using the same collisionally excited lines ( see references in section 1 ) .",
    "the validity and reliability of abundances obtained both through model fitting as well as through the @xmath7 method can be questioned . on the one hand , it is pertinent to quote a passage from a review paper written by an hii region modeller @xcite : `` a widely spread opinion is that photoionization model fitting provides the most accurate abundances",
    ". this would be true if the constraints were sufficiently numerous ( not only on emission line ratios , but also on the stellar content and on the nebular gas distribution ) and if the model fit were perfect ( with a photoionization code treating correctly all the relevant physical processes and using accurate atomic data ) .",
    "these conditions are never met in practice . '' on the other hand , there are a number of factors that can affect @xmath7-based abundance determinations . it should be stressed that the underlying logic of the classical @xmath7 method is irreproachable .",
    "however , the practical realization of the @xmath7 method relies on some assumptions that can be questioned .",
    "indeed , the equations of the @xmath7 method correlate the intensities of the emission lines with the electron temperature and abundances within a volume with constant conditions ( electron temperature and chemical composition ) . in reality ,",
    "possible spatial variations of the physical conditions inside an hii region can affect the @xmath7-based abundance determinations .",
    "thirdly , usually collisionally excited lines are used for the determination of the electron temperature and abundance in hii regions , e.g. , in the @xmath7 method .",
    "the electron temperature of an hii region can be also derived from the balmer ( or paschen ) jump @xcite , whereas the abundance of an hii region can also be determined from optical recombination lines . @xcite and @xcite determined the balmer and/or paschen jump temperatures in a large sample of low - metallicity ( 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath142 ) hii regions .",
    "they found that the temperatures of the o@xmath32 zones determined through the equation of the @xmath7 method ( from collisionally excited lines ) do not differ , in a statistical sense , from the temperatures of the h@xmath34 zones determined from the balmer and paschen jumps although small temperature differences of the order of 3%5% can not be ruled out .",
    "the o@xmath32 abundances obtained from the optical recombination lines are systematically higher ( by a factor of 1.3  3 ) than the ones determined through the equation of the @xmath7 method from collisionally excited lines ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "different hypotheses were used to explain the discrepancy between the abundances determined from the collisionally excited lines and from the optical recombination lines . @xcite assumed that the temperature field within the hii region is not uniform but that there are instead the small - scale spatial temperature fluctuations inside an hii region .",
    "if they are important then the ( o / h)@xmath25 abundance would be a lower limit and the abundances determined from the optical recombination lines remain unaltered .",
    "@xcite suggest a dual - abundance model incorporating small - scale chemical inhomogeneities in the form of hydrogen - deficient inclusions .",
    "neither abundances determined from the collisionally excited lines nor from the optical recombination lines are reliable in this case . @xcite and @xcite argue that the energy distribution of electrons in hii regions does not follow a maxwell distribution . in this case , abundances determined from optical recombination lines are more reliable .",
    "thus , at the present time there is no absolute scale for the metallicities of hii regions .",
    "until the problem of the discrepancy between the abundances determined in different ways is resolved , doubts about the validity and reliability of the @xmath7-based ( and any other ) metallicity scale will remain . if at some point irrefutable proof will be established that the @xmath7-based abundances should be adjusted then our calibration relations should be also reconsidered .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the @xmath7 method ( and , consequently , our calibrations ) produces the gas - phase oxygen abundance in hii regions . some fraction of oxygen may be embedded in dust grains . @xcite",
    "have concluded that the depletion of the oxygen abundance in hii regions can be around 0.1 dex increasing from @xmath143 dex in low - metallicity hii regions to @xmath144 dex in high - metallicity hii regions . when this effect is taken into account the total ( gas + dust ) oxygen abundance in an hii region",
    "is higher by @xmath145 dex than the one produced by the @xmath7 method and our calibrations .",
    "we derive simple expressions relating the oxygen abundance in hii regions with the intensities of the three strong lines @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ( @xmath3 calibrations ) or @xmath4 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ( @xmath5 calibration ) .",
    "we also present the @xmath3 calibration for nitrogen abundance determinations .",
    "we use a sample of 313 reference hii regions with @xmath7-based oxygen abundances obtained originally for the counterpart method ( @xmath6 method ) as a sample of calibrating data points .",
    "hii regions are usually divided in two classes : the high - metallicity objects ( the `` upper branch '' ) and low - metallicity objects ( the `` lower branch '' ) .",
    "we adopt a value of log@xmath128 as boundary between the upper and lower branches .",
    "in other words , hii regions with log@xmath55 belong to the upper branch and hii regions with log@xmath65 are lower branch objects .",
    "we derive different calibration relations for the abundance determinations in hii regions on the lower and upper branches .",
    "the ranges of the applicability of the calibration relations for the upper and lower branches overlap in the boundary region within a range of @xmath146 log@xmath147 .",
    "the oxygen and nitrogen abundances estimated through the calibrations agree with the @xmath7-based abundances within @xmath8 dex over the whole metallicity range of hii regions , i.e. , the relative accuracy of the calibration - based abundances is 0.1 dex .",
    "the oxygen and nitrogen abundances in the high - metallicity hii regions ( upper branch ) can be estimated using only the intensities of the two strong lines @xmath0 and @xmath2 ( or @xmath4 and @xmath2 for oxygen ) .",
    "the validity of the suggested calibrations was tested using a compilation of more than three thousand spectra of hii regions .",
    "the locations of the calibration - based abundances in those hii regions in the @xmath21  o / h and the n / o  o / h digrams follow well the general trends traced by hii regions with @xmath7-based abundances . also , the radial distributions of the calibration - based oxygen and nitrogen abundances across the disk of the well - studied galaxy m  101 follow those of the @xmath7-based abundances .",
    "we emphasize that there are two important advantages of our new calibrations in comparison to the existing ones .",
    "firstly , in our approach , the oxygen abundances ( o / h)@xmath51 and ( o / h)@xmath78  produced by two different calibrations ( based on different sets of strong emission lines )  agree within @xmath135 dex for the majority of the hii regions .",
    "it should be noted that the value of 0.05 dex can not be interpreted as the accuracy of the abundance determinations through our calibration relations .",
    "uncertainties in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 line measurements can introduce similar errors in the ( o / h)@xmath51 and ( o / h)@xmath78 abundances .",
    "therefore , such uncertainties in the abundance can not be revealed through the comparison between ( o / h)@xmath51 and ( o / h)@xmath78 abundances .",
    "secondly , since the ranges applicability of the calibration relations for the upper and lower branches overlap the problem with the abundance determinations in the `` transition '' zone does not appear .",

    "<S> simple relations for deriving the oxygen abundance in hii regions with intensities of the three strong emission lines @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ( @xmath3 calibration ) or @xmath4 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ( @xmath5 calibration ) in their spectra are suggested . </S>",
    "<S> a sample of 313 reference hii regions of the counterpart method ( @xmath6 method ) is used as calibrating data points . </S>",
    "<S> relations for the determination of nitrogen abundances , the @xmath3 calibration , are also constructed . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the oxygen and nitrogen abundances in high - metallicity hii regions can be estimated using the intensities of the two strong lines @xmath0 and @xmath2 ( or @xmath4 and @xmath2 for oxygen ) only . the corresponding two - dimensional relations are provided . </S>",
    "<S> there are considerable advantages of the suggested calibration relations as compared to the existing ones . </S>",
    "<S> first , the oxygen and nitrogen abundances estimated through the suggested calibrations agree with the @xmath7-based abundances within @xmath8 dex over the whole metallicity range , i.e. , the relative accuracy of the calibration - based abundances is 0.1 dex . </S>",
    "<S> although we constructed distinct relations for high- and low - metallicity objects , the separation between these two can be simply obtained from the intensity of the @xmath2 line . moreover , the applicability ranges of the high- and low - metallicity relations overlap for adjacent metallicities , i.e. , the transition zone disappears . </S>",
    "<S> second , the oxygen abundances produced by the two suggested calibrations are in remarkable agreement with each other . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the @xmath3-based and @xmath5-based oxygen abundances agree within @xmath90.05 dex in the majority of cases for more than three thousand hii region spectra .    </S>",
