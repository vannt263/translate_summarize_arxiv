    "they can be classified according to the different ways in which sakharov s conditions are realized . in grand",
    "unified theories baryon number ( @xmath9 ) and lepton number ( @xmath10 ) are broken by the interactions of gauge bosons and leptoquarks .",
    "this is the basis of classical gut baryogenesis ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in a similar way , lepton number violating decays of heavy majorana neutrinos lead to leptogenesis @xcite . in the simplest version of leptogenesis",
    "the initial abundance of the heavy neutrinos is generated by thermal processes .",
    "alternatively , heavy neutrinos may be produced in inflaton decays or in the reheating process after inflation . because in the standard model baryon number , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are not conserved , in principle the cosmological baryon asymmetry",
    "can also be generated at the electroweak phase transition @xcite .",
    "a further mechanism of baryogenesis can work in supersymmetric theories where the scalar potential has approximately flat directions .",
    "coherent oscillations of scalar fields can then generate large asymmetries @xcite .",
    "the theory of baryogenesis crucially depends on nonperturbative properties of the standard model , first of all the nature of the electroweak transition .",
    "a first - order phase transition yields a departure from thermal equilibrium .",
    "1 shows the phase diagram of the electroweak theory , i.e. the critical temperature in units of the higgs mass , @xmath11 , as function of the higgs mass in units of the w - boson mass , @xmath6 @xcite . for small higgs masses",
    "the phase transition is first - order ; above a critical higgs mass , @xmath12  gev , it turns into a smooth crossover @xcite .",
    "this upper bound for a first - order transition has to be compared with the lower bound from lep , @xmath13  gev .",
    "hence , there is no departure from thermal equilibrium at the electroweak transition in the standard model .",
    "the second crucial nonperturbative aspect of baryogenesis is the connection between baryon number and lepton number in the high - temperature , symmetric phase of the standard model . due to the chiral nature of the weak interactions @xmath9 and @xmath10 are not conserved @xcite . at zero temperature",
    "this has no observable effect due to the smallness of the weak coupling .",
    "however , as the temperature reaches the critical temperature @xmath14 of the electroweak phase transition , @xmath9 and @xmath10 violating processes come into thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the rate of these processes is related to the free energy of sphaleron - type field configurations which carry topological charge . in the standard model",
    "they lead to an effective interaction of all left - handed fermions @xcite ( cf .",
    "2 ) , @xmath15 which violates baryon and lepton number by three units , @xmath16 the sphaleron transition rate in the symmetric high - temperature phase has been evaluated by combining an analytical resummation with numerical lattice techniques @xcite .",
    "the result is , in accord with previous estimates , that @xmath9 and @xmath10 violating processes are in thermal equilibrium for temperatures in the range @xmath17     , height=226 ]    sphaleron processes have a profound effect on the generation of the cosmological baryon asymmetry .",
    "an analysis of the chemical potentials of all particle species in the high - temperature phase yields the following relation between the baryon asymmetry and the corresponding @xmath10 and @xmath18 asymmetries , @xmath19 here @xmath20 is a number @xmath21 .",

    "we conclude that lepton number violation is necessary in order to generate a cosmological baryon asymmetry @xcite . ] . however , it can only be weak , because otherwise any baryon asymmetry would be washed out .",
    "the interplay of these conflicting conditions leads to important contraints on neutrino properties and on possible extensions of the standard model in general .",
    "a first - order electroweak phase transition proceeds via nucleation and growth of bubbles ( cf .",
    "this can provide the departure from thermal equilibrium , which is necessary for electroweak baryogenesis .",

    "hence , there is no departure from thermal equilibrium and baryogenesis can not take place .",
    "the situation changes in two - higgs doublet models ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model where one can have a sufficiently strong first - order phase transition ( cf .",
    "this requires , however , a rather exceptional mass spectrum of superparticles . as the left panel of fig .",
    "4 shows , one scalar top - quark has to be lighter than the top - quark whereas other scalar quarks are 2  tev heavy .",
    "also gaugino masses have to be rather small ( cf .",
    "fig .  4 , right panel ) .",
    "even more stringent constraints are obtained if the lightest neutralino is required to be the dominant component of cold dark matter .",
    "this case has been studied in detail for the nmssm , a minimal extension of the mssm with a singlet field @xcite .",
    "5 shows the neutralino relic density as function of the neutralino mass for various parameter sets of the model represented by the scattered points .",
    "it is remarkable that the neutralino has to be very light .",
    "this suggests that , should supersymmetry be discovered at the lhc , the consistency of wimp dark matter and electroweak baryogenesis will be a highly non - trivial test of supersymmetric extensions of the standard model .",
    "in general the scalar potential of supersymmetric theories has many flat directions involving scalar fields which carry baryon or lepton number .",
    "typical examples in the mssm are @xmath27 where @xmath10 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote lepton doublets , one of the higgs doublets and quark fields , respectively . during inflation",
    "these fields generically develop large vacuum expectation values .",
    "after inflation these condensates lead to coherent oscillations , which can store large baryon and lepton charge densities .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=245,height=219 ]    in the case of the @xmath32 flat direction , the decay of the condensate can lead to the formation of q - balls as illustrated in the left panel of fig .  6 ( cf .",
    "these macroscopic objects with large baryon number and mass , @xmath33 can lead to striking signatures at super - kamiokande and icecube . alternatively , the decay of unstable q - balls can nonthermally produce higgsinos which , for the parameters shown in fig .",
    "6 , yield the observed cold dark matter density .",
    "the identification of a neutralino lsp as higgsino at lhc would be inconsistent with thermally produced wimp dark matter .",
    "a discovery of higgsino dark matter in direct search experiments could then be a hint for q - balls as a possible nonthermal production mechanism . in this way , as in the case of electroweak baryogenesis",
    ", the nature of dark matter would provide a clue also for the origin of ordinary matter .",
    "about 20 years ago , leptogenesis was suggested as the origin of matter by fukugita and yanagida @xcite . the basis of this proposal is the seesaw mechanism which explains the smallness of the light neutrino masses by mixing with heavy majorana neutrinos .",
    "the theory predicts six majorana neutrinos as mass eigenstates , three heavy ( @xmath34 ) and three light ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 here the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath37 is the product of the matrix @xmath38 of yukawa couplings and the expectation value @xmath39 of the higgs field @xmath40 , which breaks the electroweak symmetry .",
    "if yukawa couplings of the third generation are @xmath21 , as it is the case for the top - quark , the corresponding heavy and light neutrino masses are @xmath41 it is very remarkable that the light neutrino mass @xmath42 is of the same order as the mass differences @xmath43 and @xmath44 inferred from neutrino oscillations .",
    "this suggests that , via the seesaw mechanism , neutrino masses indeed probe the grand unification scale ! the difference of the observed mixing patterns of quarks and leptons is a puzzle whose solution has to be provided by the correct gut model .",
    "like for quarks and charged leptons one expects a mass hierarchy also for the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "for instance , if their masses scale like the up - quark masses one has @xmath45  gev .",
    "the lightest of the heavy majorana neutrinos , @xmath46 , is ideally suited to generate the cosmological baryon asymmetry . since it has no standard model gauge interactions it can naturally satisfy the out - of - equilibrium condition .",
    "@xmath46 decays to lepton - higgs pairs then yield a lepton asymmetry @xmath47 , which is partially converted to a baryon asymmetry @xmath48 .",
    "the generated asymmetry is proportional to the @xmath1 asymmetry @xcite in @xmath46-decays which is conveniently expressed in the following form , @xmath49 where the seesaw mass relation ( [ seesaw ] ) has been used . from the expression ( [ nice ] ) one easily obtains a rough estimate for @xmath50 in terms of neutrino masses .",
    "assuming dominance of the largest eigenvalue of @xmath51 , phases @xmath21 and approximate cancellation of yukawa couplings in numerator and denominator one finds , @xmath52 where we have again used the seesaw relation .",
    "hence , the order of magnitude of the @xmath1 asymmetry is approximately given by the mass hierarchy of the heavy majorana neutrinos .",
    "for @xmath53 one has @xmath54 .",
    "given the @xmath1 asymmetry @xmath50 one obtains for the baryon asymmetry , @xmath55 here the dilution factor @xmath56 accounts for the increase of the number of photons in a comoving volume element between baryogenesis and today , and the efficiency factor @xmath57 represents the effect of washout processes in the plasma . in the estimate ( [ basym ] ) we have assumed a typical value , @xmath58 .",
    "thus the correct value of the baryon asymmetry is obtained as consequence of a large hierarchy of the heavy neutrino masses , which leads to a small @xmath1 asymmetry , and the kinematical factors @xmath59 and @xmath57 @xcite .",

    "these models are less predictive but arise naturally in many extensions of the standard model .",
    "an intriguing aspect of thermal leptogenesis is its incompatibility with the most popular supersymmetric extensions of the standard model where the lightest neutralino is the dominant component of cold dark matter and a heavy gravitino , decaying after nucleosynthesis , requires a reheating temperature in the early universe much below the temperature needed for leptogenesis .",
    "this clash has triggered much work on alternatives to wimp dark matter .",
    "an attractive possibility is gravitino dark matter ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) which can have striking effects at the lhc as well as in gamma - ray astronomy .",
    "40 years after sakharov s work on the cosmological matter - antimatter asymmetry we have several viable models of baryogenesis , the most predictive ones being electroweak baryogenesis and leptogenesis .",
    "in fact , based on our theoretical understanding of the electroweak phase diagram , electroweak baryogenesis in the standard model has already been excluded by the lep bound on the higgs mass .",

    "the consistency with the experimental evidence for neutrino masses has dramatically increased the popularity of the leptogenesis mechanism .",
    "it is exciting that new experiments and cosmological observations will probe the absolute neutrino mass scale in the coming years .",
    "however , more work is needed on the full quantum mechanical treatment of leptogenesis , in particular the flavour dependence .",
    "all baryogenesis mechanisms are closely related to the nature of dark matter",
    ". a discovery of the standard supergravity scenario at lhc could be consistent with electroweak baryogenesis but would rule out the simplest version of thermal leptogenesis . on the other hand , evidence for gravitino dark matter can be consistent with leptogenesis .",
