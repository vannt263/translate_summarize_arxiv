    "in recent years , iron - based superconductors have been intensely studied ,  @xcite because of their high superconducting transition temperatures . as in the cuprates , antiferromagnetic ( afm )",
    "order is present in the phase diagram and phonons are not believed to be strong enough to explain the high transition temperatures .",
    "@xcite however , in the pnictides the afm phase is a metallic spin - density wave ( sdw ) rather than a system of localized heisenberg spins as is the case in the cuprates . at temperatures slightly above the transition to the sdw with ordering vector @xmath1 or @xmath2 ,",
    "many weakly doped compounds show an orthorhombic phase without long - range magnetic order , but with broken rotational symmetry .",
    "this phase has slightly different lattice constants along the in - plane iron - iron bonds ,  @xcite but the anisotropy that develops in electronic observables such as resistivity  @xcite or angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes )  @xcite of detwinned samples appears considerably more pronounced .    a number of competing scenarios have been proposed for this phase and can be broadly categorized as `` magnetism '' , `` orbital '' , and `` lattice '' driven . in the first case , the symmetry between equivalent magnetic ordering vectors @xmath1 and @xmath2 is broken and the system chooses one of them without immediately establishing long - range magnetic order .",
    "@xcite in the second picture , it is the degeneracy between two @xmath10 orbitals of the iron ion , the @xmath11 and @xmath3 states providing the greatest contribution to the states at the fermi surface ( fs ) , that is spontaneously broken ;  @xcite the resulting orbital occupation then determines the effective magnetic exchange constants that generate the sdw order .",
    "both pictures were first discussed in insulating spin and spin - orbital models and have since been generalized to take into account electron itineracy .",
    "studies in several models have shown that nematic phases can indeed develop between structural and magnetic transition temperatures .",
    "@xcite    while a definite answer about the driving mechanism may be hard to nail down , as spin , orbital ,  @xcite and lattice  @xcite degrees of freedom are naturally coupled and interact with each other , one may nevertheless try to identify the dominant ingredient(s ) . to this end",
    ", it is instructive to establish how each type of symmetry breaking manifests itself in observables .",
    "if the symmetry breaking is assumed to mostly concern the @xmath11 and @xmath3 orbitals , one can introduce it explicitly by adding a phenomenological energy splitting between the orbitals and evaluating its impact on observables such as the optical conductivity or the spectral density .",
    "these signatures were found to qualitatively agree with experiments,@xcite where states of @xmath3 character are found to be higher in energy than those of @xmath11 character in several different pnictide compounds from the two structurally slightly different``111 '' and `` 122 '' families . on the other hand ,",
    "arpes data taken above the nel temperature have alternatively been interpreted in terms of `` band folding '' due to magnetic order  @xcite or emphasising the coupling between magnetic order and the orbital states near the fermi level",
    ".  @xcite short - range magnetic order  @xcite and the spin - nematic scenario  @xcite likewise reproduce the anisotropic conductivity , and the latter has been argued to lead to an effective orbital splitting .",
    "@xcite however , a direct calculation of the spectral density in a nematic phase is so far lacking .",
    "we use here a method that combines real and momentum space , cluster - perturbation theory ( cpt ) ,  @xcite to calculate the one - particle spectral density @xmath0 for a spin - nematic phase where rotational symmetry is broken via ( very ) short - range spin correlations that are afm in @xmath12 and ferromagnetic ( fm ) in @xmath13 direction [ corresponding to ordering vector @xmath1 ] , but without long - range magnetic correlations beyond second neighbors .",
    "the obtained spectral density reproduces the momentum - dependence of the band shifting observed in arpes .",
    "@xcite if onsite interactions bring the system close to the sdw transition , a small phenomenological magnetic anisotropy leads to large anisotropies in @xmath0 .",
    "thus , we can theoretically describe the astonishing arpes result that the overall band shifts characterizing @xmath0 in the sdw phase are nearly fully developed already above the nel temperature .",
    "@xcite    in order to be able to solve the problem exactly on a small cluster , we use variants of models with three  @xcite and four  @xcite orbitals ; models and method are introduced and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : modelmethod ] .",
    "section  [ sec : results_u0 ] discusses the anisotropic band shifts induced by ( strong ) anisotropic magnetic couplings in the non - interacting models ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : results_u ] , we show that in the presence of onsite interactions and near the sdw transition , smaller magnetic anisotropies have a large impact . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , our results are summarized and discussed .",
    "+     +    the aim of the paper is to calculate the spectral density @xmath15 in a phase where ( short - range ) magnetic correlations break the fourfold symmetry of the lattice , but without long - range magnetic order .",
    "the latter requirement prevents us from carrying out our calculations directly in momentum space , as it has been done for the paramagnetic and afm phases . as an alternative approach ,",
    "we choose here cluster perturbation theory .",
    "@xcite in this method , the ground state and one - particle green s function are evaluated ( almost ) exactly ( with lanczos exact diagonalization ) for a fully interacting quantum model on a small cluster , and hoppings between clusters are treated in perturbation theory [ for an illustration see figs .",
    "[ fig : cpt ] and  [ fig : cpt3 ] ] . apart from the limit of small intercluster hoppings",
    ", this approximation also becomes exact in the opposite limit of vanishing interactions , as can be seen by considering that it amounts to replacing the self energy of the full system by that of the small cluster .",
    "@xcite long - range order can be treated with the related variational cluster approach ( vca ) ,  @xcite as it has been done for a two - orbital model for pnictides .",
    "@xcite    the biggest drawback of the vca is that correlations are only included exactly within the small cluster , while longer - range effects are treated at a mean - field level . for nematic phases with at most short - range order , this limitation turns into a huge _ advantage _ : we can break the symmetry between the @xmath12 and @xmath13 directions locally on the small cluster , see below , but without imposing long - range order by a symmetry - breaking field .",
    "if the small cluster is , e.g. , an afm coupled dimer , its groundstate is thus still given by a singlet , i.e. , a superposition of `` up - down '' and `` down - up '' , which removes long - range correlations .    when using a dimer as the directly solved cluster , we find instabilities , i.e. , poles of the one - particle green s function that are on the wrong side of the chemical potential . while this does not necessarily invalidate the results ( which are in fact similar to the more stable results described below ) , it may indicate that the self energy of a dimer differs too strongly from that of a large two - dimensional system to provide a reliable approximation . in order to be able to use three- ( four- ) site clusters instead , which lead to stable results",
    ", we restrict the hamiltonian to the four ( three ) orbitals that contribute most of the weight at the fs .",
    "the results presented here were obtained with the cluster decompositions shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : cpt ] and  [ fig : cpt3 ] , but equivalent results were found for the three - orbital model when using a `` brick - wall '' arrangement of @xmath16 clusters instead of the `` columns '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpt ] .    the momentum - dependent tight - binding hamiltonian in orbital space can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) annihilates ( creates ) an electron with pseudo - crystal momentum @xmath20 and spin @xmath21 in orbital @xmath22 .",
    "the three - orbital model used here is based on the model of ref .  , but a few longer - range hoppings were added to provide a better fit of the bands near the fs , because the original three - orbital model has magnetic instabilities too far from @xmath1/@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite the @xmath23 give the hoppings between orbitals @xmath24 and @xmath22 and are @xmath25 where a bar denotes the complex conjugate . hopping parameters are @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] shows the uncorrelated tight - binding bands .",
    "the four - orbital model was obtained by removing the @xmath39 orbital  @xcite from the five - orbital model of ref .   and slightly changing onsite energy and third - neighbor hopping of the @xmath40 orbital to alleviate the fact that removing the @xmath39 orbital moves it too close to the fermi level , see fig .  [ fig:4b_u0 ] .",
    "in principle , hoppings can be extended to three dimensions and parameters could be fitted to model specific compounds , at least in the more detailed four - orbital model .",
    "the features we aim to study here  an anisotropy between the @xmath4 and @xmath8 points  have been experimentally observed in different compounds , and we are going to see that both the three- and the four - orbital models lead to similar results despite their somewhat different dispersions , suggesting that fine - tuning of the kinetic energy is not crucial .",
    "we use a unit cell with one iron atom to distinguish between momenta @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which would both map to @xmath41 for a two - iron unit cell . due to an internal symmetry of the two - iron unit cell ,",
    "@xcite it is always possible to use a one - iron unit cell for tight - binding models restricted to an fe - as plane .",
    "however , the @xmath11 and @xmath3 orbitals with momentum @xmath42 couple to the other orbitals at momentum @xmath43 .",
    "thus , one writes the tight - binding hamiltonians in terms of a pseudo - crystal momentum @xmath44 , which is @xmath45 for @xmath11/@xmath3 and @xmath46 for @xmath47/@xmath40/@xmath39 . in real space , such a notation corresponds to a local gauge transformation , where replacing , e.g. , the @xmath48 orbital at site @xmath49 by @xmath50 ( and analogously for @xmath40 and @xmath39 ) leads to a translationally invariant hamiltonian with a one - iron unit cell . for comparison with arpes experiments",
    ", however , this gauge transformation has to be undone , which implies that spectral weight at @xmath44 with orbital character @xmath47 , @xmath40 or @xmath39 is plotted at @xmath51 .",
    "@xcite    in order to study a nematic phase , the four - fold lattice symmetry is explicitly broken by introducing a phenomenological heisenberg interaction , which couples electrons in all orbitals , @xmath52 where @xmath24 , @xmath22 denote orbitals and @xmath53 nearest - neighbor ( nn ) bonds . for @xmath54 , the coupling is afm ( fm ) along the @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) direction .",
    "the electron - spin operators are given by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the vector of pauli matrices .",
    "these interactions act only within the small cluster that is solved exactly .",
    "we are here not going to investigate the origin of such a breaking of rotational symmetry , which has been shown to occur in several models ,  @xcite but we will study its impact on the system .",
    "we find that when the system is close to the spin - density wave , very small values of @xmath57 trigger highly anisotropic band distortions , suggesting that short - range correlations , as observed in a spin - fermion model ,  @xcite indeed favor such a symmetry breaking .",
    "when onsite interactions  @xcite are taken into account , the same values of intra - orbital coulomb repulsion @xmath58 , inter - orbital repulsion @xmath59 , hund s rule coupling @xmath60 and pair hopping @xmath61 were used for all orbitals , along with the standard relation @xmath62 , giving @xmath63 where @xmath64 denote the orbital and @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) is the spin ( electronic density ) in orbital @xmath67 at site @xmath68 . while the parameters relating to the @xmath47 and @xmath40 orbitals can in principle be slightly different from each other and the @xmath11/@xmath3 doublet , symmetric interactions were chosen for simplicity .",
    "+    in order to study the effects of phenomenological short range magnetic correlations , the hamiltonian given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : h0k ] ) and ( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) , was initially treated with the vca on a four - site cluster , with afm interactions along @xmath12 and fm ones along @xmath13 but without onsite coulomb and hund interactions .",
    "a fictitious chemical potential was optimized as a variational parameter , but did not have a large impact on the results .",
    "no tendencies towards long - range order were found , which agrees with expectations : since the afm heisenberg interaction only acts within the cluster , it favors a total cluster spin of @xmath69 . in the large system , consisting of many noninteracting clusters , there is no magnetic order .",
    "rather large @xmath70 has to be chosen to induce appreciable signatures of the anisotropy , which is a very large energy scale compared to the other parameters of the hamiltonian .",
    "the reason is that the non - interacting model with four electrons per site does not contain any net unpaired spins that can directly be coupled by a heisenberg interaction ; the interaction first needs to be strong enough to induce a local spin .    the spectral density for @xmath71 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3b_u0_janis ] .",
    "apart from the fact that the heisenberg interactions make the spectrum more incoherent , the bands are most strongly modified near @xmath72 , which corresponds to the ordering vector that would be favored by the nn afm interaction along @xmath12 .",
    "one clearly sees that the @xmath3 states around @xmath4 are moved to higher energies , while the @xmath11 states at @xmath73 are shifted to slightly lower energies in agreement with experiments .",
    "the energy shifts are momentum dependent : while the differences between @xmath4 and @xmath8 are large , changes around @xmath74 are far less pronounced .",
    "the corresponding orbital - resolved fs can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs_3b_u0_janis ] . like the spectral density",
    ", it shows some features that are similar to those resulting from band folding in a @xmath1 sdw ; for example , the @xmath11 electron pocket at @xmath8 has a `` mirror pocket '' at @xmath75 .",
    "however , the fs is still qualitatively different from the fs found in the long - range ordered sdw , where folding leads to additional features and largely suppresses the @xmath3 weight ,  @xcite which dominates the hole pockets here .",
    "such differences related to long - range order are consistent with arpes experiments in nafeas ,  @xcite see also the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : results_u ] .",
    "+   +    the same behavior as in the three - orbital model is seen for the four - orbital case , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ak_janis_u0_4b ] , where @xmath15 is shown for increasing @xmath76 . in the last case ,",
    "the splitting between the states at @xmath4 and @xmath8 is @xmath77 .",
    "taking into account that the overall band width has to be renormalized by a factor of 2 - 3 , this is consistent with the order of magnitude of the @xmath78 splitting reported for ba(fe@xmath79co@xmath80)@xmath81as@xmath81 .",
    "@xcite this can be compared to an explicit orbital splitting , similar to the mechanism proposed in ref .  .",
    "the splitting can be written as @xmath82 , where @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) is the density in the @xmath11 ( @xmath3 ) orbital , and was set to @xmath85 , which approximately reproduces the energy difference between the @xmath4 and @xmath8 points indicated by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:4b_u0_j04 ] . a momentum - independent splitting large enough to reproduce the energy differences between the @xmath4 and @xmath8 points substantially distorts the features near the @xmath86 point as well .",
    "while the unoccupied states above the chemical potential at @xmath86 are not easily accessible in arpes , available data on the bands defining the hole pockets appear more consistent with the slighter changes caused by momentum - dependent shifts of the nematic scenario , especially for cases with a large splitting between the features near @xmath4/@xmath8 , where the bands near @xmath86 would be very strongly distorted by a rigid shift .",
    "@xcite     +    total orbital densities do not turn out to be a reliable way to characterize the impact of the nematic order on states near the fermi energy .",
    "densities in the @xmath11 and @xmath3 orbitals differ only slightly in the four - orbital model with @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",
    "this value is not strongly affected by @xmath89 hole or electron doping , in contrast to a proposed sign change for hole doping  @xcite and it is broadly consistent with the small orbital polarizations found in mean - field analyses for the sdw state .",
    "@xcite in the three - orbital model , the orbital polarization is even _ opposite _ with @xmath90 , because spectral weight with @xmath3 character is transferred below the fermi level [ see the density of states shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : dos_3b ] ] , and in contrast to the four - orbital model [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_4b ] ] , this weight is not balanced by @xmath11 states further away from @xmath24 . nevertheless , the band reconstruction near the fermi level and the band anisotropy are very similar in the two models .",
    "afm correlations along @xmath12 always bring the @xmath3 states around @xmath4 closer to the fermi level , even when the total orbital densities satisfy @xmath91 , in contrast to a naive expectation that the @xmath3 bands should be lowered in energy in this case . when onsite interactions bring the three - orbital model closer to the sdw transition ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : results_u ] below ) , the orbital densities become almost equal with @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "total orbital densities can determine magnetic properties via the goodenough - kanamori rules in mott insulators , which do not have a fs .",
    "on the other hand , since the pnictides are more metallic with strongly hybridized orbitals , a more consistent and clearer picture can here be obtained if one concentrates on spectral weight near the fermi level as will be discussed below .",

    "( [ eq : hcoul ] ) including spin - flip and pair - hopping terms can easily be included in the vca .",
    "interaction strengths were chosen below the critical values for the onset of long - range order because we want to focus on short - range correlations here . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ak_janis_withu ] for the two models considered here , lower values of @xmath94 is now sufficient to induce substantial asymmetries , in contrast to the larger @xmath95 to @xmath96 needed for the noninteracting models .",
    "onsite interactions favor local magnetic moments , even in the absence of long - range order , that can then be coupled even by weaker @xmath57 .",
    "finally , we study the three - orbital model very close to the sdw transition by setting @xmath97 . in a mean - field treatment as used in ref .",
    ", one finds an sdw with long - range magnetic order , but the optimal vca solution does not yet show long - range order due to the presence of quantum fluctuations .",
    "however , the system is so close to a magnetically ordered state that very small @xmath98 already introduces strong short - range order and corresponding band anisotropies .",
    "several occupied low - energy bands [ e.g. between @xmath74 and @xmath73 as well as around @xmath99 in the spectral density , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3b_u12_janis ] , have energies reduced by a factor of @xmath5 , consistent with the renormalization factor @xmath5 - @xmath100 needed to reconcile density - functional bands with arpes .",
    "bands above the fermi level do not have reduced widths .",
    "this asymmetric impact of correlations is in agreement with dynamical mean - field studies .",
    "@xcite in addition to the renormalization , @xmath101 induces an energy splitting of @xmath9 between the @xmath4 and @xmath8 points .",
    "in fact , the band at @xmath4 has moved slightly _ above the chemical potential _ , as expected for the sdw phase . the fact , that this happens even in the absence of long - range order , is in excellent agreement with recent arpes data for nafeas , where it was likewise found that the overall band positions at @xmath4 and @xmath8 nearly reach their `` sdw values '' above the nel temperature .  @xcite    nevertheless , the corresponding fs , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fs_3b_u12_janis ] , clearly shows important differences to that of the sdw state : as the @xmath3 states cross the chemical potential here with a rather low fermi velocity ( leading to an elongation of the hole pocket at @xmath86 along the @xmath12-direction ) , they contribute substantial weight to the fs .",
    "in fact , both of the strong features along the @xmath86-@xmath4 line are of @xmath3 character . in the sdw phase , in contrast , the @xmath3 orbital dominates the afm order parameter and is thus mostly gapped out .",
    "@xcite related effects have likewise been observed in arpes , where these @xmath3 bands open gaps at the nel temperature .",
    "the variational cluster approach was used to study the spectral density of a nematic phase in three- and four - orbital models for iron - based superconductors .",
    "we found that the method is well suited for problems involving short - range correlations without long - range ( magnetic ) order .",
    "the correlations considered in this study were extremely short - range , going only over nn sites , the minimum to break rotational invariance . while this is a somewhat extreme scenario ,",
    "it has been argued that magnetic correlations that are effective only on a very short range lead to the linear temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility at high temperatures .",
    "@xcite nuclear quadrupole resonance  @xcite indicates that there are as ions seeing different electronic surroundings in the `` underdoped regime '' , which would be in agreement with the present scenario of as ions involved in `` magnetic '' vs. `` non - magnetic '' bonds .",
    "when symmetry between the @xmath12- and @xmath13 directions is broken by a phenomenological magnetic interaction that is afm in the @xmath12 direction , the bands with @xmath3 character around momentum @xmath72 move to higher energies , i.e. , closer to the fermi level .",
    "this is in agreement with arpes on detwinned samples above the magnetic transition temperature , in both the `` 122 '' compound ba(fe@xmath79co@xmath80)@xmath81as@xmath81 ,  @xcite and the `` 111 '' compound nafeas .",
    "@xcite the latter is not expected to have surface states@xcite that might complicate the analysis of arpes in 122 compounds.@xcite the changes in the band structure due to the nematic order not only depend on the orbital , but also on momentum .",
    "changes around the @xmath74 point are far less pronounced than differences between @xmath4 and @xmath8 , again in agreement with arpes .",
    "@xcite total orbital densities and their difference are model dependent and not a reliable predictor of reconstructions of low - energy states . however , the orbital - resolved spectral weight and the bands near the fermi level are affected in the same way both in a three- and a four - orbital model , with and without onsite interactions indicating that they are more universal and less dependent on details of the model hamiltonian . in agreement with previous findings on the orbital polarization of the fs in the sdw phase  @xcite and on transport properties ,",
    "@xcite this suggests that total ( orbital ) densities are here less important than in mott insulators , as the metallic character of the pnictides makes states near the fermi level far more important than those further away .",
    "when onsite interactions are strong enough to bring the system close to the sdw transition , very small anisotropic couplings can deform the bands until their broad features resemble bands in the sdw regime , i.e. , bands are renormalized by a factor of @xmath5 and the @xmath3 states at @xmath4 move above the chemical potential , as seen in arpes on nafeas just above the nel temperature .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , the fermi surface still differs from that of a state with full long - range magnetic order , where the @xmath3 states are mostly gapped out ,  @xcite again in agreement with arpes .",

    "<S> using cluster - perturbation theory , we calculate the spectral density @xmath0 for a nematic phase of models describing pnictide superconductors , where very short - range magnetic correlations choose the ordering vector @xmath1 over the equivalent @xmath2 and thus , break the fourfold rotation symmetry of the underlying lattice without inducing long - range magnetic order . in excellent agreement with angle - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the @xmath3 bands at @xmath4 move to higher energies . </S>",
    "<S> when onsite coulomb repulsion brings the system close to a spin  density - wave ( sdw ) and renormalizes the band width by a factor of @xmath5 , even small anisotropic couplings of @xmath6 to @xmath7 strongly distort the bands , splitting the formerly degenerate states at @xmath4 and @xmath8 by @xmath9 and shifting the @xmath3 states at @xmath4 above the chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> this similarity to the sdw bands is in excellent agreement with arpes . </S>",
    "<S> an important difference to the sdw bands is that the @xmath3 bands still cross the fermi level , again in agreement with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we find that orbital weights near the fermi surface provide a better characterization than overall orbital densities and orbital polarization . </S>"
