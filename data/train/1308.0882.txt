    "the development of the research in extra - solar planetary systems has been successful continuously for nearly two decades .",
    "in addition to the steadily increasing number of newly detected systems , many new aspects of discoveries also make this field extremely exciting .",
    "it is the doppler - shift method to make many extra - solar planetary systems known to us .",
    "in addition , the method of transit , micro - lensing , and direct imaging also produce fruitful results . in particular , more than 100 extra - solar planets ( exoplanets ) have been found to transit their host stars .",
    "moreover , kepler space telescope is revealing many interesting results recently .",
    "for example , one of the greatest accomplishment is the discovery of a system with 6 planets .",
    "these results really demonstrate the state - of - art power of the transit technique .    among these detected planetary systems , tres3 ( odonovan et al .",
    "2007 ) attracts many attentions due to its strong transit signal and short period comparing with other known systems detected before 2007 .",
    "for example , sozzetti et al . (",
    "2009 ) presented a nice work which combines both spectroscopic and photometric observations of tres3 to obtain the best models for the host star and planet . with an aim to study the possible transit timing variations , gibson et al .",
    "( 2009 ) did nine transit observations .    on the other hand , fressin et al .",
    "( 2010 ) even use spitzer space telescope to monitor tres3 during its secondary eclipse .",
    "the most important constraint from their results is to show that orbital eccentricity is almost zero , consistent with a circular orbit assumption .",
    "furthermore , the 10.4-m gran telescopio canarias ( currently the world s largest optical telescope ) has obtained extremely high - precision narrow - band transit data for the tres3 system ( colon et al .",
    "there is almost no deviation for data on the light curve , so this data could give a strong constraint on orbital parameters of exoplanet tres3b .",
    "in this project , we monitor the tres3 system by the 0.8 meter telescope of tenagra observatory in arizona , america . in",
    "may and june 2010 , five runs of transit observations were done by our group successfully . by the differential photometry performed through the software iraf , five light curves are obtained .",
    "in addition to these five light curves , many more data are taken from exoplanet transit database ( etd ) , which is an internet site supported by czech astronomical society ( poddany et al .",
    "the tres3b transit data available in colon et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , which employed a 10.4 meter telescope , is also included into our analysis here .",
    "etd classifies their data into 5 classes , from quality 1 to 5 based on the flux deviation of light curves . in this analysis ,",
    "seven quality 1 , fourteen quality 2 , and two quality 3 data are taken to be used .",

    "1 shows our light curves and best fitting models .",
    "2 presents the @xmath0 diagram , in which the differences between the observed mid transit time , @xmath1 , and the calculated mid transit time of a simple star - planet two - body system , @xmath2 , are plotted . to produce this diagram",
    ", we first have to assign the epoch @xmath3 to each transit event .",
    "the one with smallest mid transit time , @xmath4 , would be given epoch @xmath5 , and the epochs of all the rest data can be assigned according to their @xmath4 easily . using a linear function , @xmath6 , where @xmath3 is treated as a variable and @xmath7 , @xmath8 are constants , to do chi - square fitting on all the available observational data set of @xmath9",
    ", we can get the best @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the plot @xmath10 as a function of epoch @xmath3 , in which the best @xmath7 and @xmath8 are used for @xmath11 , is the @xmath0 diagram .    note that we do not allow period @xmath7 to change freely , but only vary slightly around the value given in sozzetti et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and that variation of 0.0002 days is only about 0.3 min . the variation of mid transit times shown in fig .",
    "2 are obviously much larger . in the @xmath0 diagram , the transit timing variation ( ttv ) is about 3 to 4 min .",
    "based on this result , if we use a straight line of zero variation to fit those data in @xmath0 diagram , we obtain a reduced @xmath12 to be 8.77 .",
    "thus , the assumption with no ttv provides a bad fit to the data , and some level of ttv probably exists ."
