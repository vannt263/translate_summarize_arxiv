    "addition of new heavy quarks would require the extension of the flavor mixing in charged current interactions as well as the extension of higgs sector in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "a large number of new heavy quark pairs can be produced through their colour charges at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "however , due to the expected smallness of the mixing between the new heavy quarks and known quarks through charged current interactions , the production and decay modes can be effected by the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) interactions . a new symmetry beyond the sm is expected to explain the smallness of these mixings .",
    "we may anticipate the new physics discovery by observing large anomalous couplings in the heavy quark sector .",
    "the couplings of the new heavy quarks can be enhanced to observable levels within some new physics models . in numerous phenomenological studies ( see @xcite and references therein ) , a lot of extensions of the sm foresee the extra gauge bosons , the @xmath0-boson in particular .",
    "flavor changing neutral currents can be induced by an extra @xmath13 gauge boson @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0 boson in the models using an extra @xmath13 group can have tree - level or an effective @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 and @xmath16 both can be the up - type quarks or down - type quarks ) couplings .",
    "the @xmath9 , @xmath12 and @xmath10 models corresponding to the specific values of the mixing angle in the @xmath17 model with different couplings to the fermions , and the leptophobic @xmath11 model with the couplings to quarks but no couplings to leptons are among the special names of the @xmath0 models @xcite .",
    "the atlas and cms collaborations have performed extensive searches of new vector resonances at the lhc .",
    "we summarize briefly these searches , that exploited data from the @xmath18 run at @xmath19 tev and @xmath20 tev , as well as the corresponding constraints on @xmath0 boson masses .",
    "the most stringent limits come from searches with leptonic final states ( @xmath21 ) : @xmath22 gev @xcite and @xmath23 gev @xcite , @xmath24 gev @xcite ( more recently @xmath25 gev @xcite ) for the @xmath0 boson predicted by the @xmath13 extensions , also extending to the mass limit of @xmath26 gev @xcite for a gauge boson with sequential couplings .",

    "the relevant signal cross sections have been calculated and especially the benefit from flavor tagging to identify the signal has been discussed .",
    "considering an existence of sizeable couplings to the new heavy quarks , the @xmath0 boson decay width and branchings , as well as the production rates , can be quite different from the expectations of usual search scenarios .    in the models of interest",
    "new heavy quarks can have some mixing with the sm quarks .",
    "for example , in composite higgs model @xcite the lightest new heavy quark couples predominantly to the heavier sm quarks ( top and bottom quarks ) . in the models of vector - like",
    "quarks ( vlq ) @xcite they are expected to couple preferentially to third - generation quarks and they can have flavour - changing neutral current couplings , in addition to the charged - current decays characteristic of chiral quarks . within the @xmath17 model the isosinglet quarks @xcite are predicted and they can decay to the quarks of the sm .",
    "the new heavy quarks can be produced dominantly in pairs through strong interactions for masses around 1 tev in the @xmath18 collisions of the lhc with a center of mass energy of @xmath37 tev .",
    "the single production of new heavy quarks would only be dominant over pair production for the large quark masses @xcite , it is model dependent , and it could be suppressed if the mixing with sm quarks is small .",
    "there are searches for pair production and single production of new heavy quarks at the lhc .",
    "the atlas and cms collaborations focused on decay modes of new heavy quarks into a massive vector boson and a third generation quark assuming a @xmath38 branching ratio , based on @xmath39 fb@xmath40 of @xmath18 collision data at @xmath20 tev , and set lower mass limit for up type new heavy quark as @xmath41 gev @xcite and @xmath42 gev @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we investigate the single production of new heavy quarks via fcnc interactions through @xmath0 boson exchange at the lhc .",
    "this paper aims at studying the signal and background in detail within the same mc framework , and the relevant interaction vertices are implemented into the mc software . analyzing the signal observability ( via contour plots ) for different mass values of the @xmath0 boson and new heavy quarks as well as the mixing parameter through fcnc interactions are another feature of the work . in section",
