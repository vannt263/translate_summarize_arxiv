    "a remaining big problem is to explore the origin of inflation or to disclose the identity of a scalar particle called @xmath7inflaton  .",
    "the following requirements can be imposed on the model as clues to a solution .",

    "the inflaton is an ad - hoc particle introduced by hand , and the stability of potential is threatened by radiative corrections and gravitational ones relating non - renormalizable terms suppressed by the power of the planck mass because the inflaton takes a larger value than the planck mass and such corrections can not be controlled without any powerful symmetries and/or mechanisms .    effective field theories on a higher - dimensional space - time provide a possible solution to the problem .",
    "some scalar fields exist inevitably as parts of ingredients in the theory and are massless at the tree level .",
    "the scalar potential can be induced radiatively and stabilized by local symmetries .",
    "typical ones are the extranatural inflation model  @xcite and the radion inflation model  @xcite . in the former model , a scalar field called @xmath7gauge - higgs  appears from the extra - dimensional component(s ) of the gauge field .",
    "it becomes dynamical degrees of freedom called the wilson line phase and its value is fixed by quantum corrections  @xcite . in the latter model , a scalar field called @xmath7radion",
    " originates from the extra - dimensional component(s ) of the graviton , and its vacuum expectation value ( vev ) is related to the size of the extra space .",
    "recently , the effective potential with respect to both the radion and the gauge - higgs has been derived at the one - loop level upon the @xmath8 compactification , from the gravity theory coupled to a @xmath0 gauge boson and matter fermions on a 5-dimensional ( 5d ) space - time  @xcite .",

    "the values of several parameters can be of the order of the planck mass and the field value of the gauge - higgs is above the planck scale .",
