    "motivated by the simplicity and predictability , a number of authors have explored its phenomenology @xcite .",
    "these research works are very helpful for us to understand some more complicated dm models .    in this paper",
    ", we try to give a comprehensive analysis for the real singlet scalar dm model . instead of assuming the fixed higgs mass",
    ", we scan the whole parameter space of the dm and higgs masses . for the resonance case",
    ", one should consider the breit - wigner resonance effect .",
    "once the coupling between dm particle and higgs boson is derived from the observed dm abundance , the dm elastic scattering cross section on a nucleon and the dm annihilation cross section in the galactic halo can be straightly calculated .",
