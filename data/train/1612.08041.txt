    "in 2004 geim _ et al . _ isolated a single layer of graphite , setting off the discovery of a long list of remarkable properties of graphene , such as its great strength , high mobility , and linear electronic energy spectrum.@xcite one additional extraordinary property it displays is a strain - induced pseudo - vector potential.@xcite the deformation of the monolayer graphene lattice introduces strain which alters the phase difference between adjacent sites in a tight - binding model of the system .",
    "this phase difference can be viewed as arising from a `` pseudo - magnetic field.''@xcite such a pseudo - magnetic field does not break time reversal symmetry because it couples with opposite sign to electrons occupying different dirac points in the band structure .",
    "one consequence of this was dramatically demonstrated by the observation of quantized landau levels in strained graphene in the absence of an external magnetic field.@xcite this effect can be substantial : strain - induced vector potentials in static monolayer graphene have produced pseudo magnetic fields of 300 t.@xcite    there has been much theoretical and experimental work done to study the pseudo - magnetic field created by strain applied to a static graphene layer.@xcite in this paper we will discuss the physics of a rapidly oscillating pseudo - magnetic field generated by an acoustically driven graphene ribbon .",
    "if models developed for static lattice distortions are valid for the relatively `` slow '' acoustic oscillations , the system can potentially have pseudo - magnetic fields of several tesla oscillating at a kilohertz .",
    "such a regime is inaccessible for normal magnetic fields and opens up many new possibilities .    in this work",
    "we start with a review of the connection between pseudo - magnetic fields and applied strain .",
    "we then investigate the theory of two physical consequences - the presence of an oscillating pseudo - quantum hall effect phenomena and valley charge polarization in low density graphene nano - ribbons .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of consequences for experiment .",
    "we consider an ideal 2d graphene nano - ribbon suspended between supports .",
    "the ribbon is driven acoustically by a piezoelectric transducer to produce a transverse standing wave .",
    "an atom at the position @xmath0 is displaced by vector @xmath1 ( fig.[fig : expt ] ) @xmath2 producing a standing wave with displacements in the y direction .",
    "the stretching in the graphene layer produced by displacement produces a strain tensor @xmath3 which is given by @xmath4      this strain tensor alters the phase difference between atoms in a tight - binding model of graphene in a fashion equivalent to one induced by a gauge field @xmath5 ( pseudo - magnetic vector potential).@xcite @xmath6}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the lattice constant and @xmath8 and c are dimensionless parameters that are equal to 2 and 1 respectively.@xcite the quantity @xmath9 is the pseudo - spin , taken as @xmath10 at the @xmath11 point in the 2d bandstructure , and @xmath12 at the @xmath13 point .",
    "therefore , even in the absence of a real magnetic field a strong pseudo - field is observed which comes from the curl of @xmath5 , but it is of opposite sign for electrons of opposite `` valley - spin . '' for the displacement of eq.([eqndisplacement ] ) the magnetic field is given by @xmath14 we have introduced a dimensionless strain amplitude f = @xmath15 .",
    "the strain amplitude is expressed as the ratio of the wave amplitude to a half wavelength , so that in terms of wave number , @xmath16 .",
    "we assume a suspended graphene nanoribbon set up for a two - terminal measurement , driven with an acoustic oscillation of a wavelength on the order of several microns .",
    "the oscillation has a wavelength much longer than the coherence length of electrons in the system , and a frequency far less than the characteristic electron - electron scattering rate .",
    "therefore we treat each horizontal slice of the ribbon with displacement @xmath17 as an independent , equilibrium , quantum hall `` sample '' with a longitudinal resistance @xmath18 given by the value it would have in a _ uniform _ magnetic field @xmath19 .",
    "since the longitudinal resistance in quantum hall systems is non - universal , we take a representative value from published experimental         data @xcite on graphene in fig.([fig : janssen ] ) .",
    "the oscillating strain produces a pseudo - magnetic field standing wave with a maximum amplitude that potentially can reach several tesla .",
    "the resistivity obtained from the interpolation of fig.([fig : janssen ] ) will therefore also oscillate in space and time , ( fig.[fig : resistivity1 ] ) .",
    "the oscillations of pseudo - field display more structure as the strain amplitude is increased , as shown in fig.([fig : resistivity1 ] ) .",
    ", as a function of strain amplitude @xmath20 .",
    "the total resistance is calculated by integrating the resistivity of fig.([fig : resistivity1 ] ) across one wavelength .",
    "the wavelength of the oscillation is @xmath21 , and the resistance amplitude is calculated using the experimental data of ref.(@xcite ) . ,",
    "width=307 ]    , where @xmath22 is the strain amplitude of a standing wave of wavenumber @xmath23 .",
    "the resistance oscillates as a function of time because the effective strain amplitude , @xmath24 , oscillates in time .",
    "the resistance at any instant in time corresponds to integrating over a position slice of the resistivity plotted in fig.([fig : resistivity1]b ) for some value of this effective strain amplitude . , width=288 ]    it is important to note that this effect does not break time reversal symmetry .",
    "electrons from different k - points see opposite signs of the pseudo - magnetic field , but the magnetoresistance is independent of the sign of the field , so both pseudo - spins polarizations are gapped ( or not gapped ) at exactly the same value of the strain .",
    "a more experimentally accessible property for a mechanically oscillating ribbon is its total resistance . for the oscillating monolayer",
    "graphene the total resistance at any point in time will be given by numerically integrating the resistivity graph of fig.([fig : resistivity1 ] ) along the length of the ribbon .",
    "if we choose a specific point in the oscillation , say when @xmath25 , we can calculate the expected resistance at that point as a function of strain amplitude .",
    "this calculated resistance varies non - monotonically as a function of strain amplitude as shown in fig.([fig : resistivity2 ] ) .",
    "it oscillates because increasing the strain amplitude may allow the pseudo - magneto - resistance to reach a higher resistance peak in fig.(2 ) , increasing the total resistivity , but increasing the strain further brings it into a regime of lower resistivity while simultaneously reducing the width of the higher resistance region .",
    "the width is reduced because the entire range of the sweep of the pseudo - magnetic field must still fit within one wavelength , and increasing the strain amplitude does not change the wavelength of the oscillation .",
    "the lower minima in the oscillations at larger strain are a reflection of the fact that the experimental data for @xmath18 has deeper minima at larger fields .",
    "alternatively , we may plot the resistance of the ribbon as a function of time as the standing wave goes through one oscillation .",
    "if fig.([fig : resistivity1]a ) represents a slice of fig.([fig : resistivity1]b ) at constant strain amplitude @xmath20 , then the sinusoidal time dependence of the oscillation corresponds in effect to sweeping this slice from @xmath26 to the some maximum value and back . to get the resistance at any time @xmath27 we simply must integrate the corresponding slice along the @xmath28 direction .",
    "an example of a resistance trace as a function of time for a given strain amplitude is given in fig.([fig : rhovtime ] )      finally , we may plot the time average of the resistance of the ribbon as a function of strain amplitude , as shown in fig.([fig : rhoavg ] ) .",
    "as can be seen from above , much detail of the structure will be lost by integrating the resistivity over both space and time . however , this is the simplest and most straighforward measurement that would show this fundamental quantum mechanical effect from an acoustic oscillation .",
    "as discussed above , a strain field can effectively act as a pseudo - magnetic field on a monolayer graphene .",
    "since in our case the strain is oscillating in time , the pseudo - magnetic field is also oscillating in time .",
    "however any time dependence in the pseudo - magnetic field can be turned into a pseudo - electric field by a gauge transformation . in our case",
    "we have gauge transformation gives pseudo - electric field from pseudo - magnetic field as        the pseudo field drives the electrons from k and @xmath13 valleys in opposite directions , producing no net current in the system .",
    "this must be true because time reversal symmetry has not been broken and a total net current is not generated .",
    "however , in a finite sample it might be possible for different pseudo - spin polarizations to `` pile - up '' on the boundary , with electrons at the @xmath11 point driven to one edge , while those at @xmath13 driven to the other .",
    "the result is that electrons of different valley polarization will accumulate on opposite edges of the ribbon leaving positive region on the interior .",
    "the ribbon will have a non - zero quadrupole moment .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate , assuming that all free charge is split into two piles at the edges of the system would give a voltage difference between the center and at the edges to be on the order of a hundred volts .",
    "however , this estimate neglects the @xmath35 scattering rates at the edges .",
    "if the rate is sufficiently high , the charge imbalance may be too small to measure .",
    "we can remove the edge effect by driving the ribbon with a more structured wave .",
    "if the graphene nano - ribbon is driven acoustically with displacement @xmath36 , the pseudo - electric field is @xmath37 \\sin{(\\omega t ) } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the pseudo - electric field has a non - zero divergence in opposite directions for opposite valleys electrons as seen in fig.([fig : electricfield ] ) .",
    "again , the field is in opposite directions for electrons at different @xmath11-points , but in this case it would lead to a square lattice of charge , with the @xmath11 and @xmath13 electrons forming an interlaced checkerboard of charge .",
    "again , the amount of charge imbalance would depend upon the @xmath35 scattering rate , but in this case there is no edge to act as a mechanism for scattering .",
    "experiments have already verified that a static strain in graphene can produce a pseudo - magnetic field of many tesla .",
    "if the static distortion calculation is valid for the `` slow '' distortion of an acoustic wave , then pseudo - magnetic fields of several tesla could be observed to oscillate at high frequency , a previously inaccessible regime of electron dynamics .",
    "we have investigated two resulting phenomena - an oscillation in the resistance due to a quantum hall - like effect , and a faraday - like effect produced from time dependent pseudo - magnetic field .",
    "these phenomena should be observable at experimentally accessible frequencies and temperatures .",
    "if these phenomena are not observed , then the cross - over from the experimentally validated static theory to a time dependent distortion must itself be investigated ."
