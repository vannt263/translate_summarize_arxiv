    "in one - spatial dimension any weak disorder is believed to have the potentiality of converting a good metal to an insulator , as a consequence of the anderson localization.@xcite however , the existence of two counter examples for this common belief has been pointed out recently , both being found in a carbon nanostructure , exhibiting a perfectly conducting channel ( pcc ) .",
    "the two examples are i ) the metallic carbon nanotube ( cnt),@xcite@xcite and ii ) the zigzag graphene nanoribbon ( gnr ) with edge modes of partially flat dispersion.@xcite@xcite a pcc is immune to backward scattering ; its existence allowing the conductance of the system to remain _ finite _ even when its length @xmath0 becomes infinitely long , indicating the _ absence _ of anderson localization .",
    "note also that both cnt and gnr can be regarded as a derivative form of an infinitely large graphene sheet possessing two energy valleys around its dirac points @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "since scattering between these two valleys , i.e. , the inter - valley scattering , usually destroys the perfectly conducting channel , we focus on the case in which the system is subject to only long - ranged scatterers , i.e. , impurities whose potential range is larger than or comparable to the size of the unit cell .",
    "this paper highlights the behavior of such a pcc believed to be existent in the carbon nanostructures .",
    "since a pcc appears within a quantum - mechanical framework , one may think that it is fragile against a loss of the phase coherence due to inter - electronic coulombic interaction , electron - phonon coupling , etc .",
    "this naive speculation , however , turns out to be not necessarily the case , as we further elaborate the description of this phenomenon below .",
    "we have performed extensive numerical study of such carbon - based disordered quasi - one - dimensional systems using the standard tight - binding representation of the graphene s honeycomb lattice structure ( see fig .",
    "[ zigzag ] ) .",
    "our treatment of the dephasing follows that of ref .  .",
    "in the case of gnr with zigzag edge boundaries , the existence of a pcc is originated from its peculiar band structure .",
    "indeed , one can give it a simple interpretation based on the appearance of partially flat - band edge modes.@xcite since these flat bands appear only in a part of the one - dimensional brillouin zone connecting the two valleys , if one counts the number of conducting channels of each propagating direction at a given fermi energy , there always exist an excess right - going channel in one valley and an excess left - going channel in the other valley .",
    "let @xmath3 be the number of conducting channels in each valley in the absence of the edge modes .",
    "the above fact indicates that the number of right - going ( left - going ) channels is @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) in one valley and @xmath4 ( @xmath3 ) in the other valley .",
    "this imbalance leads to the appearance of one pcc which is robust against disorder,@xcite resulting in a noteworthy statement on the scaling of the dimensionless conductance @xmath5 , i.e. , ",
    "@xmath5 scales naturally to a smaller value as the length @xmath0 of the disordered region increases , but in the large-@xmath0 limit , @xmath5 remains to be a finite as @xmath6.@xcite@xcite interested readers may refer to ref .",
    "and references therein for more detailed discussion on the transport characteristics of such a system with an imbalance in the number of right- and left - going channels . in a recent paper,@xcite one of the authors",
    "has shown that this pcc still survives even in the incoherent regime , where information on the phase of the electronic wave function is essentially lost .",
    "this unexpected robustness of the pcc in gnrs in the presence of dephasing ( see also fig . [ plot - g ] ) stems most certainly from the fact that the imbalance in the number of conducting channels is not a consequence of a particular symmetry ( cf .",
    "role of the so - called `` pseudo - time reversal '' symmetry in the cnt case , see the discussion below ) ; it is simply guaranteed by the existence of partially flat - band edge modes .",
    "in contrast to the case of gnr , the existence of a pcc in cnts is a much subtle issue .",
    "it is certainly essential that the system belongs to the symplectic symmetry class , i.e. , the total hamiltonian of the system inclusive of the random potential must , not only be time - reversal symmetric ( trs ) , but also fall on the case of @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the time - reversal operator .",
    "this is typically the case with an effective spin-@xmath9 system of a dirac - type conic dispersion relation though in this case trs is not a real one ( often dubbed as `` pseudo - trs '' ) .",
    "this condition , therefore , will be safely satisfied in cnts under the influence of long - ranged potential disorder",
    ". however , this condition alone turns out to be still not a sufficient one for ensuring the existence of a pcc .",
    "much work on this subtlety , associated with the parity of the number @xmath10 of the conducting channels in each single dirac cone , has been pursued by ando and co - workers in the context of studying the transport characteristics of cnts at a very early stage in the development of this field.@xcite@xcite to the best of our knowledge a clear statement on the condition for the appearance of pcc , i.e. , the idea that _ both _ of the following two conditions : i ) appurtenance to the symplectic symmetric class , ii ) oddness of the number of conducting channels , must be satisfied , has first appeared in ref .  .",
    "notice that in the band structure of metallic cnts , only the single lowest gapless subband ( of quasi - linear dispersion ) is non - degenerate , whereas other quadratic subbands are all two - fold degenerate .",
    "therefore , wherever the fermi level @xmath11 is , the number of conducting channels in each propagating direction in a given valley is necessarily odd .",
    "this ensures the existence of at least one pcc per valley ( cf .",
    "[ plot - c ] ) .",
    "clearly , the dimensionless conductance @xmath12 ( @xmath13 in the clean limit ; here the factor 2 comes from the two valleys ) decreases as disorder increases , but remains finite due to the appearance of two pccs .",
    "this can be rephrased as follows : `` for a fixed strength of disorder , @xmath12 scales down to a smaller value as the system becomes longer ( as @xmath0 increases ) , but it approaches asymptotically to an integral value , which is 2 , in the long-@xmath0 limit '' .",
    "such a behavior of the so - called `` symplectic - odd symmetry class '' has been more profoundly elucidated by the subsequent studies@xcite@xcite in the context of the dmpk equation and the supersymmetric field theory .",
    "the existence of pcc in cnts relies on the presence of pseudo - trs .",
    "therefore , it could be fragile against any disturbances that might cause breaking of the pseudo - trs , e.g. , against trigonal warping of the dirac cone.@xcite it is , therefore , natural to presume that pcc might be fragile against dephasing.@xcite in this paper , we have extended this consideration on the role of dephasing in the robustness of pcc in cnts , primarily for the comparison with the gnr case , but with much care to the dependence on the circumference @xmath14 of the nanotube . is , the more closely are the subbands spaced .",
    "also , the further one goes away from the dirac point , the stronger the trigonal warping becomes in the spectrum of a cnt .",
    "combining these two observations , one immediately realizes that for a fixed value of @xmath11 and a given number of @xmath10 , the warping effects become stronger with decreasing @xmath14 , leading to stronger pseudo - trs breaking . ]",
    "let us consider again the case of a gnr with @xmath15 zigzag lines as shown in fig.[zigzag ] .",
    "the electronic states in this nanostructure is described by a tight - binding hamiltonian , @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent the localized electron state and the impurity potential , respectively , on site @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the transfer integral between sites @xmath19 and @xmath21 with @xmath22 if @xmath19 and @xmath21 are nearest neighbors and @xmath23 otherwise .",
    "we assume that the zigzag lines are infinitely long . instead , we distribute impurities ( randomly ) only in a finite region ( the disordered region , composed of @xmath24 columns ) of this infinitely long ribbon .",
    "what we have been calling the `` system s length @xmath0 '' so far is now identified as the length @xmath24 of this disordered region , i.e. , @xmath25 .    in the actual computation ,",
    "we have numerically estimated the dimensionless conductance @xmath5 using the landauer formula and recursive green s function method .",
    "we assume that the potential profile of the scatterers is gaussian with its characteristic range @xmath26 chosen to be @xmath27 , a value large enough for avoiding the inter - valley scattering .",
    "we then let the amplitude of this gaussian random potential @xmath28 be uniformly ( randomly ) distributed within the range of @xmath29 .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , the effects of dephasing has been taken account of by the approach employed also in ref .",
    ", i.e. , by separating the entire sample into several segments of equal length @xmath30 .",
    "let us now look at fig .",
    "[ plot - g ] .",
    "the main panel shows a linear plot of @xmath31 , indicating that @xmath31 converges to unity irrespective of the presence or absence of dephasing ; a clear signature of the appearance of a pcc .",
    "this partly confirms numerically our earlier prediction based on a boltzmann equation approach , stating that `` the pcc in a gnr is so robust that it may possibly survive even into the incoherent regime.''@xcite in our plots one can also observe that @xmath31 in the presence of dephasing is slightly larger than the case of no dephasing .",
    "this feature is more clearly highlighted in the semilog plot of @xmath32 .",
    "when @xmath33 ( i.e. , @xmath0 is very large ) , the value of @xmath32 without dephasing scales away from a quasi - linear ( stable ) behavior in the presence of dephasing .",
    "this is probably due to residual inter - valley scattering .",
    "notice that here dephasing plays indeed the role of _ stabilizing the pcc _ against weak inter - valley scattering .",
    "let us finally analyze our numerical data for cnts ( fig .",
    "[ plot - c ] ) .",
    "we make a few remarks on our cnt data , which show a number of contrasting features to the case of gnr .",
    "first , the value of @xmath31 is _ smaller _ in the presence of dephasing than in the absence of dephasing , which is consistent with the result of ref .  .",
    "this simply opposes the gnr case . in some cases ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) @xmath31 decreases even below the `` protected '' value of 2 as @xmath36 increases .",
    "as mentioned earlier , trigonal warping of the dirac cone is omnipresent whenever the fermi level is away from the dirac point , and this can possibly come into play in the transport characteristics of a cnt,@xcite when its diameter or @xmath15 is not large enough . this seemingly weak effect associated with the breaking of pseudo - trs is shown to give a destructive influence on the scaling behavior of @xmath31 in the large-@xmath36 limit .",
    "dephasing does not help .",
    "these observations lead us to our second conclusion that a stable existence of the two pccs in a cnt is restricted to the case of a very _ large diameter _ and of a relatively _ small doping_.",
