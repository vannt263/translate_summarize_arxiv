    "lobes of radio sources associated with active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are huge reservoirs of energy so even when fuelling provided by the jets is cut - off , they are still observable , albeit in a relic form , for a substantial amount of time .",
    "@xcite argue that the so - called coasting phase of the lobes may last up to @xmath2yr hence it is quite likely that ignition of a new active episode can still take place during the coasting phase , i.e. before the lobes have faded completely .",
    "the observable effect of this coincidence would be the presence of a new pair of radio lobes straddled with an old , larger , double - lobed relic structure .",
    "if both pairs of lobes are co - linear and if there is a common centre of symmetry located at the galactic nucleus then the whole such structure is labelled a double  double radio source ( ddrs ) . the list of best - known ddrss and the review of their properties has been given by @xcite .",
    "since the outer lobes of ddrss are no longer fuelled , they have steep spectra due to ageing , thus they are best observable at low radio frequencies . to attain high resolution at that part of the spectrum ,",
    "numerous ddrss have been targeted by giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) .",
    "nevertheless , the most comprehensive approach in such investigations is to combine the gmrt low - frequency data with the very large array ( vla ) data obtained at higher frequencies . to date",
    ", only few ddrss , e.g. j1453@xmath03308 ( @xcite ) and pks1545@xmath3321 ( @xcite ) , have been investigated this way .",
    "owing to determination of their spectra over a wide frequency range , many of the astrophysical parameters could be established , including the ages of both inner and outer lobes as well as the length of the quiescence period between two epochs of activity the two pairs of lobes are signatures of .    in this article",
    ", radio data for j1706@xmath04340 gathered in the range from 74 to 8460mhz , predominantly by means of the gmrt and vla observations , are analysed in order to study the dynamics and energetics of this source .",

    "following the earlier work of @xcite and @xcite , the dynamical analysis presented in this study has been carried out using dynage code ( @xcite ) based on the analytic model for the evolution of frii - type radio sources .",
    "it combines the pure dynamical model of @xcite with the model of expected radio emission from a source under the influence of the energy loss processes elaborated by @xcite  the kda model . for a given set of observables , this numerical code allows one to solve the inverse problem , i.e. to determine four free parameters of the kda model : ( 1 ) the initial power - law energy distribution of the relativistic electrons @xmath50 related to the effective injection spectral index @xmath53 ( see table 3 ) , ( 2 ) the jet power @xmath47 , ( 3 ) the density of the external gaseous medium near the radio core @xmath48 , and ( 4 ) the age of the source s radio structure @xmath52 .",

    "the values of the remaining free parameters of the model have to be assumed .",

    "the original kda model assumes a constant and uninterrupted jet flow delivering relativistic gas to the expanding lobes throughout the whole lifetime of a source .",

    "though the radio spectra for each of the inner lobes are derived , it should be pointed out that their unusually high asymmetry in the observed luminosity ( @xmath731:8 ) poses a difficulty for the modelling .",
    "indeed , such asymmetry induces significantly different values of the model parameters of individual lobes , like @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath52 . in this context",
    ", some self - consistent model solutions explaining the case by different ambient density profiles along the opposite jets were proposed by @xcite and @xcite but for the primary ( outer ) lobes in a sample of giant radio sources .",
    "a similar issue related to the secondary ( inner ) lobes of a known ddrs j1548@xmath33216 was discussed by @xcite , however in that case the relevant asymmetry was only about 1:2 .",
    "the same aspect in two other ddrss ",
    "b1430 + 333 and b1843 + 620  was analysed and discussed by @xcite . here",
    ", we confine our analysis to the whole inner structure , i.e. omitting differences between the opposite lobes and using one half of the sum of the flux densities in columns ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of table2 to calculate the radio luminosities at a given observing frequency .",
    "it has been pointed out by e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite that due to a large number of free parameters , the applied analytical model is very flexible hence quite different sets of its parameters may fit the observational data  especially the radio spectrum  with a comparable level of significance . since an independent observational constraint on the model parameters , e.g. on the ambient medium density provided by the x - ray measurements , is not available here , particularly for a density inside the outer lobes of j1706@xmath04340 , searching for a minimum of the jet energy delivered into the source , @xmath74 is included into our procedure .",
    "we investigate two opposing models . in the first one ,",
    "a power - law density distribution of the external gaseous medium with a standard exponent @xmath75 is assumed , while in the other one it is assumed that the inner lobes evolve into a pure uniform medium with @xmath76 inside a cocoon formed and inflated by the material of the primary jet flow . in both models , we assume that the lobes are filled only with magnetic fields and relativistic particles governed by a relativistic equation of state with @xmath77 . columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of table4",
    "show the fitting results for these two models , respectively .",
    "the relevant flux densities resulting from the first model are shown in column ( 5 ) of table2 for a comparison with observations and fig.[fig : spectr_model ] shows the model spectrum compared to the observed data points .",
    "the differences between various physical parameters resulting from these two models are further discussed in sections[age ] and [ su_exp ] .",
    "contrary to the inner structure , the energy density of the outer hence older lobes may contain some contribution from thermal non - radiating particles , i.e. @xmath78 .",
    "we thus set @xmath79 for these lobes .",
    "note that when the jet activity is terminated , the adiabatic expansion of the primary lobes is expected to slow down and faster energy losses of the relativistic electrons are presumed .",
    "therefore , two different phases of their dynamical evolution should be considered , the first one corresponding to the ongoing feeding of the lobes by the active jets ( source ages @xmath80 ) and the second one corresponding to the case when the jet flow has ceased ( ages @xmath81 ) .",
    "importantly , the evaluation of the fading lobes luminosities is done taking into account only those relativistic electrons that were injected into the lobes during the first phase of evolution , i.e. the ongoing jet activity .",
    "the integration over the injection time for the expected radio emission is performed following the prescription given by @xcite for relic radio sources .    as a first step ,",
    "we search for the best model solution with @xmath82 .",
    "the fitted values of the model parameters are shown in column ( 4 ) of table4 .",
    "note that the resultant values of @xmath53 are almost identical in the best solutions for both the inner and outer lobes .",
    "this is in an agreement with the main conclusion drawn by @xcite based on a study of a sample of eight ddrss ( j1706@xmath04340 was not included there ) .",
    "moreover , the values of @xmath53 and @xmath47 we obtained follow the correlation between @xmath53 and @xmath47 found by @xcite  see the bottom panel of their fig.2  even though the method of determination of @xmath53 and @xmath47 they used and the one we adopted here were different . those different approaches and their implications for the @xmath53 and @xmath47 estimates",
    "are further discussed and commented in section[remarks ] .",
    "it should also be noted that the derived jet power during its primary activity is comparable to its fitted value during the recurrent activity .",
    "the above result , obtained with the fitting procedure carried out independently for the outer and inner structures , may indicate that @xmath47 can not vary significantly between the two active phases .",
    "however , the model of the inner lobes with @xmath76 admits slightly higher value of @xmath47 than that for the outer lobes .",
    "it is obvious that a contribution to the energy density of these lobes from possible thermal particles requires an increase of the jet power to explain their observed radio emission .",
    "therefore , we investigate another model for the outer lobes with @xmath83 , finding that @xmath84 already satisfied a condition @xmath85 .",
    "the relevant model parameters are shown in column ( 5 ) of table4 and the flux densities resulting from the model with @xmath82  in column ( 7 ) of table2 .    except for the fitted values of the model parameters defined in section[num_cod ] ,",
    "some derivative physical parameters of the radio structures are also shown in table4 .",
    "these are the following : the longitudinal expansion velocity of the lobe given by differentiation of the formula for the jet length ( cf .",
    "equations(4 ) and ( 5 ) in @xcite ) , the ambient density at the end of the lobe , @xmath86 , the pressure inside the lobe , @xmath87 and @xmath88 for the inner and the outer lobes , respectively , where @xmath89 corresponds to the cocoon s pressure given by equation20 in @xcite and @xmath90 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and a mean value of the magnetic field strength , @xmath91 , where @xmath92 $ ] is the magnetic field energy density .",
    "note that all the models reveal a similar agreement with the observational data .",
    "the last line in table4 presents the @xmath93 values reduced by the degree of freedom .",
    "although these values are rather high , they are overestimated by the large discrepancy between the flux densities measured on the miyun synthesis radio telescope ( msrt ) and gmrt maps at @xmath73240mhz used to determine the radio spectrum of the outer lobes ( cf .",

    "since the spectroscopic redshift of the host galaxy of j1706@xmath04340 is not available , we use its photometric estimate  it has been given in section[opt_data ] .",
    "it is among the highest redshift values of radio galaxies suspected for a recurrent nuclear activity ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . note that only b1843@xmath0620 galaxy ( @xmath94 ) belongs to the group of well - studied ddrss at redshift of @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , the dynamical model parameters of j1706@xmath04340 derived by the fit to its observational data , i.e. the energetics , ages , etc . , can be less certain than those for sources with spectroscopic redshift available , and hence with more certain distance to the observer enabling a better determination of their size , luminosity , and radio spectrum . taking into account possible overestimation of the adopted redshift",
    ", we performed the fitting procedure for the inner and the outer lobes adopting @xmath96 .",
    "such hypothetical much lower value of redshift enables an investigation of its influence on the fitted values of @xmath53 and @xmath47 .",
    "note that at this redshift both pairs of the lobes will appear less luminous and their span shorter compared to the respective values at @xmath97 .",
    "in particular , the span of the inner / outer lobes will be @xmath98 kpc and @xmath99 kpc , respectively , placing j1706@xmath04340 below the lower limit of the size of a grg mentioned in section[structure ] .",
    "likewise a decreased luminosity will imply a lower jet power adequate to provide the observed radio emission .",

    "for example , @xcite have already modelled most of the sources from the sample of @xcite providing a comparison between spectral and dynamical @xmath53 values , and finding @xmath47 values @xmath73(1.22 ) times higher than those in @xcite .",
    "the latter result is easily explained by the fact that their approach accounts for the synchrotron losses only but not for the adiabatic expansion of the lobes .",
    "however , it is worth emphasizing that @xcite have analysed and discussed an interesting problem of whether the injection spectral index and the jet power in the outer and the inner lobes of ddrss are expected to differ or not .",
    "they pointed out that the principal factor determining @xmath53 should be the strength of the jet - termination shock which , in turn , should depend on the external medium density @xmath111 .",
    "since the inner lobes are immersed in the cocoon material of the outer lobes whose @xmath111 is very likely different from the density of the primary environment surrounding the latter ones , one can expect a systematic difference between @xmath112 and @xmath113 , which is not observed . on the other hand ,",
    "there is commonly expected that @xmath114 depends on the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) mass , the accretion disc properties and accretion rate , and perhaps the smbh spin ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the question why a correlation between the spectral index and the jet power ",
    "the quantities that are ruled by quite different physical conditions inside the nucleus of a host galaxy and in the external environment  exists , deserves further study .",
    "the age solutions for the inner and outer lobes collected in table4 suggest that the last renewal of the jet activity took place about 12myr ago , thus its present age is about @xmath115  per cent of the age estimated for the outer lobes structure . on the other hand , the quiescent period time emerging from the model fits , @xmath116 , of about @xmath117myr is not much larger than the age determined for the inner structure",
    ". however , it should be increased by the real time elapsed between the last jet material ejected by the agn and the time it reached the head of the still - expanding lobe which is not taken into account in dynage algorithm . when this is accounted for ,",
    "the age proportions are very similar to those found in other already investigated ddrss .    the first attempt to estimate the time - scales of the interruption of the jet flow was undertaken by @xcite .",
    "they showed that this ` elapsed ' time is comparable to the age of inner lobes in their sample of five very large ddrss including b1450@xmath0333 and b1834@xmath0620 further modelled by @xcite in terms of their dynamical evolution .",
    "also , @xcite found comparable values for the ages of the inner lobes and the time lag @xmath116 , especially in the case of b1834@xmath0620 .",
    "another example of intensively studied ddrs is pksb1545@xmath3321 ( j1548@xmath33216 ) .",
    "its restarted jet activity was analysed and discussed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the inner lobes are deeply immersed into the extended cocoon of the primary radio emission implying a very short time - scale between cessation and renewal of the jet activity estimated as ( @xmath118)myr , while the fitted age of these lobes is @xmath119myr .",
    "duration of the quiescent phase can be also estimated from the curvature of the radio spectrum due to the energy losses caused by the synchrotron and inverse - compton processes . in order to compare such estimate with",
    "that derived using dynage , the spectral jp model has been fitted to the spectrum of the outer lobes of j1706 + 4340 , and the value of @xmath120ghz has been determined using synage package ( @xcite ) adopting the injection spectral index @xmath121 , and the magnetic field strength @xmath122nt ,",
    "i.e. the values found using dynage .",
    "it follows that duration of the period of quiescence is @xmath123myr .",
    "as can be seen , the uncertainty of this period is very unsymmetrical ; its upper limit is a little higher than ( @xmath117)myr estimated with the dynamical analysis , however rather expected as discussed above .      not only lacks j1706@xmath04340 optical spectrum but there are also no x - ray observations available that , in principle , could provide some constraints on the model parameters including density , pressure , and kinetic temperature of the intergalactic medium surrounding the ddrs under investigation",
    ". nevertheless , a crude estimates of the ambient kinetic temperature and the sound speed in the ambient gaseous environment are possible using the derivative physical parameters shown in table4 . from the equation of state ( for a perfect gas ) :    @xmath124    @xmath125^{1/2},\\ ] ]    where the pressure of the jet s head ( working surface of the bow shock ) is taken as @xmath126 , and the ratio @xmath127 is adopted from @xcite . assuming the mean atomic weight @xmath128",
    ", we find @xmath129 kev and @xmath130 for the outer lobes .",
    "since the model with @xmath82 gives @xmath131 , the ratio @xmath132 supports a presumption based on a lack of hot spots and any trace of a bow shock on the radio maps , that the longitudinal expansion of these lobes is subsonic , i.e the mach number @xmath133 .",
    "it is worth noting that the above ambient temperature is fully compatible with the x - ray temperatures in the samples of 20 powerful 3cr radio source ( @xcite ) , and 31 nearby clusters of galaxies ( @xcite ) , fitted to the observed counts made with the _ xmm  newton _ and _ chandra _ observatories .",
    "estimation of the kinetic temperature inside the cocoon surrounding the inner lobes is problematic because their gaseous environment is likely modified by the jet flow during the earlier phase of activity .",
    "thus , using the more conservative value of @xmath134 instead of @xmath135 in calculation of @xmath136 values from the two models investigated in section[inn_lobes ] for these lobes , we find @xmath137 kev , and @xmath138 in the model with @xmath75 , as well as @xmath139 kev and @xmath140 in the model with @xmath76 .",
    "so , dividing the corresponding values of the advance speed of the inner lobes @xmath141 ( inserted in table4 ) by the relevant sound speeds given above , we find the mach number in the range 815 .",
    "the value @xmath142 kev estimated in the frame of the model with @xmath76 perhaps permits to distinguish the model with the uniform external density distribution , because such temperatures were found in the centres of haloes or clouds of x - ray emitting gas surrounding nearby radio galaxies ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . also the @xmath136 value ,",
    "higher for the outer lobes than that for the inner ones , is in line with the electron density and temperature profiles presented in @xcite .",
    "1 .   in this article",
    ", we present a comprehensive study of a newly discovered ddrsj1706@xmath04340 . we carried out radio observations of this object with gmrt and the vla at several frequencies ranging from 152 to 8460mhz and we present images resulting from these observations . the double ",
    "double structure is clearly visible in these images albeit only at frequencies lower than or equal to 1425mhz .",
    "the outer lobes are diffuse and show no traces of hotspots .",
    "it follows that they are in the coasting i.e. the final stage of their evolution .",
    "2 .   we supplemented our data with those in the literature and constructed spectra of different parts of j1706@xmath04340 covering more than two orders of magnitude wide frequency range : from 74 to 8460mhz .",
    "we modelled these spectra with dynage code and determined the ages of both the outer and inner lobes , as well as duration of the quiescent period .",
    "the resulting age of the outer lobes ( @xmath1myr ) appears to be the oldest among relevant age estimates in other well - studied ddrss , e.g. j0041@xmath03224 ( @xcite ) , b0925@xmath0420 ( @xcite ) , and those cited in section[age ] where , unlike in j1706 + 4340 , the majority of them still reveal either weak hotspots or a trace of bow shocks .",
    "3 .   the frequency break , @xmath143 , determined from the fit of the jp model to the outer lobes spectrum with synage , together with the magnetic field strength , @xmath71 , found with dynage , provide independent estimate of the quiescence period , fully compatible with that determined in the dynamical analysis .",
    "it is an order of magnitude shorter than the age of the outer lobes , whereas the age of the inner lobes is only @xmath115 per cent of the outer ones .",
    "all these results fit the well established paradigm ruling the ddrss : they are restarted sources where the two pairs of lobes are pertinent to two consecutive episodes of activity separated by a period of quiescence . because of the appreciable steepness of the spectra of the outer lobes above @xmath143 , combined with their diffuseness , their apparent absence in the vla images at 4860 and 8460mhz may be considered explained .",
    "the highly co - linear axes of both pairs of the lobes imply that the smbh in the central agn has a stable orientation . for the lack of noticeable distortions in the overall radio structure of j1706 + 4340",
    ", it is the spin of smbh rather than e.g. an instability of the accretion disc that is likely to be responsible for the jet production .",
    "therefore , it may be expected that the new jets , formed after disruption of their primary flow , should have the same power as the old jets .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the above condition was almost fulfilled in dynage solution shown in column ( 4 ) of table4 .",
    "however , we show that an admixture of non - radiating particles in the older outer lobes , parametrized by @xmath84 , increases the energy requirement providing satisfactory surplus of the jet power",
    "we show how the pressure conditions in the lobes derived from dynage solutions allow a crude estimation of the kinetic temperatures of the gaseous environment surrounding the outer and the inner lobes as well as the relevant speeds of sound .",
    "we note that the temperature estimate around the outer lobes is fully compatible with the x - ray temperatures measured in the samples of powerful 3cr radio sources and nearby clusters of galaxies .",
    "we also find that the current longitudinal ( very likely adiabatic ) expansion of the outer lobes is already subsonic , thus compatible with presumption that they are in the coasting stage of their evolution .",
    "+ on the other hand , the head expansion of the inner lobes is an order of magnitude faster than the outer ones , and the relevant mach number is around 10 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that these young lobes can substantially modify the surrounding matter by driving strong shocks and heating gaseous content of the old cocoon .",
    "the extreme different values for the exponent of the external density distribution along the inner lobes assumed in the fitting procedure with dynage though providing comparable ages and other model parameters ( except of @xmath48 ) , imply clearly different kinetic temperatures of the ambient medium , @xmath144kev in the model with @xmath75 and @xmath142kev in that with @xmath76 .",
    "it seems that the latter solution is preferred because such temperatures are typical for the x - ray emitting haloes detected around nearby radio galaxies .",
