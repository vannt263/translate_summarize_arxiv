    "over the last few years there has been a lot of interest in the cosmic `` co - evolution '' of supermassive black holes ( smbh ) and the stellar populations of the galaxies that they reside in .",
    "this has been motivated on the one hand by the tight scaling relations that have been established between the masses of the black holes and various parameters of the host galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and on the other by the overall similarities between the evolution of the star - formation rate density of the universe and the luminosity density that is ascribed to smbh accretion ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this paper seeks to link directly the evolution of the galaxy and agn populations via a simple phenomenological model .",
    "+ looking first at galaxies , almost all galaxies can be broadly classified into a few distinct populations .",
    "the majority of star - forming ( sf ) galaxies have a star - formation rate ( sfr ) that is strongly correlated to their existing stellar mass , producing the so - called `` main sequence '' in which the specific sfr ( or ssfr ) varies only weakly with stellar mass .",
    "this characteristic ssfr of the main sequence however increases strongly with look - back time ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and is about a factor of twenty higher at @xmath8 compared with the present day value .",
    "a small percentage of star - forming galaxies have significantly elevated ssfr , above the main sequence .",
    "it appears that the fraction of these `` outliers '' is more or less constant to z @xmath9 2 @xcite and that they represent of order 10% of the integrated star - formation that is occurring at any epoch .",
    "there is also a large population of `` quenched '' galaxies in which the star formation is substantially lower than on the main sequence , producing an ssfr that is much lower than the inverse hubble time .",
    "our understanding of the physical processes that lead to the quenching of star - forming galaxies is still quite limited and a number of plausible physical mechanisms have been proposed ( some of which involve agn directly ) .",
    "however , the main empirical , or phenomenological , features of this quenching process are quite well understood based on the characteristic of the evolving population(s ) of galaxies . + as the available data on the galaxy population at substantial look - back times has improved , new analysis techniques have been introduced that take a purely empirical ( phenomenological ) approach to the data , see e.g @xcite and @xcite",
    ". these are complementary to the semi - analytic models of galaxy evolution ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "+ the approach in @xcite was to identify a few striking simplicities exhibited by the galaxy population(s ) and to explore the consequences of these , where possible analytically , in terms of the most basic continuity equations linking the galaxy population(s ) at different epochs .",
    "the @xcite analysis was based on dividing the galaxy population into two components , the star - forming main sequence ( including the outliers ) and the quenched population of passive galaxies .",
    "much of the @xcite formalism is based on the observation that the characteristic schechter @xmath10 of the mass - function @xmath11 of the star - forming population has been more for less constant back to at least @xmath12 ( and likely to @xmath13 ) despite the substantial increase in stellar mass ( by a factor of 10 - 30 ) of any galaxy that stays on the star - forming main sequence over this same time period ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the @xcite continuity formalism is very successful at reproducing the single and double schechter @xcite shapes of the mass functions of star - forming and passive galaxies in sdss and also explains the quantitative relations between the schechter parameters of these mass functions which constitute a test of the approach .",
    "the formalism allows easy computation of things like the quenching rate of galaxies , the mass function of galaxies that are undergoing quenching at any epoch , and so on .",
    "the alternative phenomenological approach of  abundance matching `` ( @xcite ) provides similar results , in terms of mass functions and star formation histories . with these recent developments",
    ", we now have a self - consistent , empirical ( ' ' phenomenological \" ) description of the evolving galaxy population at least back to z @xmath9 4 in terms of the evolving mass - functions of both the star - forming and quenched populations of galaxies .",
    "+ turning to the agn , the most basic description of the evolving population is the bolometric luminosity function ( i.e. quasar luminosity function , qlf ) , i.e. @xmath14 .",
    "large homogeneous samples of agn have been created , from optical surveys such as sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and deep x - ray surveys , out to redshifts @xmath15 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these qlf studies have found that the qlf @xmath16 is best described by a double power law , i.e. two power - law segments broken at a characteristic luminosity @xmath17 , @xmath18 these studies tend to agree that the increase in the number density of luminous quasars with increasing redshift is mostly driven by an evolution of @xmath17 at redshifts below @xmath8 .",
    "the exact shape of the qlf and need for evolution of other parameters is still debated ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "+ the double power - law shape of the qlf contrasts the galaxy mass function @xmath11 which is clearly better described by one or more schechter functions , i.e. a power - law at low masses ( or luminosities ) and an exponential cut - off at masses above a characteristic mass @xmath19 .",
    "this difference in the shapes of these two most basic descriptions of the two po=10000pulations is interesting in that agn are being harboured in galaxies and one might naively expect similarities between these two functions .",
    "this difference will form an important part of the current analysis .",
    "+ the luminosity of an individual agn can be expressed as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is given in erg s@xmath22 , @xmath23 is the eddington ratio and @xmath24 is the mass of the central black hole in units of solar mass .",
    "the smbh mass is therefore a key quantity in understanding both an individual agn and the agn population .",
    "unfortunately , black hole masses can be measured reliably with dynamical modeling only for small number of nearby sources in which the smbh is generally quiescent ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and references within ) .",
    "objects that are actively accreting and/or that are further away need to be analyzed with different techniques .",
    "for agns that show broad lines in their spectra it is possible to determine @xmath24 by conducting reverberation mapping campaigns ( see review by @xcite and references within ) .",
    "the results of such campaigns makes it possible to construct  single - epoch `` mass estimators , which allow the determination of @xmath24 of agn based on luminosity and line width .",
    "systematic uncertainties in these estimators are calibrated using a sample of local agns for which black hole masses are statistically known from the @xmath25 of local ( inactive ) galaxies .",
    "+ early suggestions that the distribution of specific accretion rates onto black holes has no dependence on black hole or galaxy mass ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , have gained further observational support from analysis of the primus and cosmos survey fields ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we will adopt a similar assumption in this paper .",
    "+ observations in the local universe have revealed several interesting correlations between the mass of the smbh in the center of a given galaxy and various quantities describing the surrounding galaxy .",
    "specifically , quite tight relations have been established with the stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath25 ) and with the stellar mass of the bulge in the galaxy ( @xmath26 ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "canonical values of the ratio between @xmath24 and @xmath27 are between @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the recent extensive review by @xcite has argued for larger values , up to @xmath30 , mainly due to differentiation between bulges and pseudo - bulges , by omitting mergers in progress and by the inclusion of dark matter into dynamical modelling .",
    "other scaling relations have been proposed , such as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is sersic index describing the light profile of the galaxy , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is mass of the dark matter halo and @xmath35 where @xmath36 is integrated stellar mass of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "all these relations tend to show more scatter , but the basic difficulty is that most of these galaxy parameters are strongly correlated with each other .",
    "it has been claimed that the correlation between @xmath35 is more fundamental then @xmath26 relation @xcite , especially in star - forming hosts , which could then help to explain the agn sources in bulgeless , pure disk , galaxies that have been observed @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will base the analysis on @xmath35 simply because the available mass functions of galaxies generally utilise the integrated stellar mass rather than the bulge mass , especially at high redshift .",
    "+ in fact , almost all of the properties of galaxies that host agn are still widely debated .",
    "although there are undoubtedly some active agn found in quenched galaxies , the bulk of radiatively efficient agn seem to reside in star - forming galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , especially in those relatively low luminosity systems where the host galaxy can be most easily discerned .",
    "nevertheless , it is still not entirely clear what fraction of agn are situated in quenched galaxies and whether this fraction changes with agn luminosity .",
    "+ many studies have suggested that there is some redshift evolution in mass scaling relations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but others have found no significant evolution ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or have argued that an observed evolution can be fully explained with selection effects ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . the redshift evolution of the scaling relations is still debated and we will explore different possibilities in the current paper within our model framework .",
    "we will also emphsize the methodological issues associated with the choice of samples .",
    "+ several studies have also attempted to constrain different aspects of black hole evolution with empirical or semi - empirical approaches which model the evolving black hole mass function , accretion rate , qlf , duty cycle , accretion efficiency or some subset of these quantities ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "+ in this work , we aim to apply a similar phenomenological approach that has proved so successful in describing the evolving galaxy population evolution to the evolving agn population .",
    "we will take the simplest observables of the population and try to infer the underlying simplicities of the situation and use straightforward prescriptions to construct a simple model that can both explain the salient observational data and which can be used to make simple testable predictions for other quantities .",
    "a focus of this work is to try to use our improved understanding of the evolving galaxy population , and especially of the evolving mass function @xmath37 of galaxies to high redshifts , to interpret the evolution of the agn population .",
    "we aim thereby to create a simple global model to interpret the evolving agn population and to enable us to evaluate biasses that may arise in observational work , e.g. through the use of luminosity - selected samples .",
    "the model is based on the construction of the agn qlf via a double convolution of the underlying host galaxy mass function with a scatter function representing the black - hole to stellar mass ratio , and with an eddington ratio distribution .",
    "+ @xcite and @xcite have also used the observed galaxy mass functions as a basis for modelling the agn population using agn lightcurves obtained from simulations .",
    "a more similar approach to ours has been used by @xcite with an observationally driven model that connects agn and galaxy evolution out to z @xmath9 1 , based on observational data from the primus survey @xcite .",
    "they have shown that is possible to reproduce the luminosity function measurements with a mass - independent distribution of specific accretion rates , i.e. linking the agn qlf to the galaxy _ mass function_. @xcite has also used a simple phenomenological approach and shown that the main observational trends ( such as qlf and sfr-@xmath38 correlations ) can be recovered by assuming that all star - forming galaxies host an agn and that star formation and black hole accretion are correlated on @xmath9 100 myr time - scales , i.e. in this case they were linking the _ growth _ of the black holes and stellar populations .",
    "a very recent paper of @xcite has , like the current work , explored the links between the evolving galaxy ( and halo ) mass functions and the observed agn qlf via a convolution approach .",
    "@xcite have emphasised the degeneracies between the `` mass function '' and `` mass growth '' approaches when only the agn qlf is considered . in the current work ,",
    "we incorporate other observational data , most notably the distribution of agn in the @xmath39 plane , to move beyond the information in the qlf alone .",
    "+ the layout of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : ansatze ]",
    "we first state the three simple anstze that are used to construct the model .",
    "we then show in section [ sec : originqlf ] how the quasar @xmath16 can be simply constructed from the galaxy @xmath37 and eddington ratio distribution @xmath40 via a convolution , show how the parameters of these distribution functions are connected , and make testable predictions of the mass distribution of the host galaxies of quasars selected at different luminosities . in section [ sec : data ] we review the observed epoch - dependent @xmath41 and @xmath14 functions and then in section [ sec : comparing ] we compare these within the framework of the convolution model to derive interesting conclusions about the duty cycle of agn .",
    "+ up until this point , the model is completely general . in section [ sec : twmd ] , we then consider different possibilities for the evolution of the @xmath2 ratio and show that one particular choice can explain the observed distribution of luminous quasars in the ( @xmath42 plane and local scaling relations of black holes in both star - forming and passive galaxies and the possible differences in evolution of active and passive systems .",
    "section [ sec : dis ] presents a discussion of some further implications of both the general model and the specific @xmath2 implementation , differences between @xmath2 and @xmath25 the appearance of downsizing within the agn population , and the pervasive biasses that enter into luminosity - selected samples .",
    "the paper then concludes with a summary section .",
    "+ throughout the paper , we will assume a @xmath43cdm cosmology , with parameters @xmath44=0.3 , @xmath45=0.7 and @xmath46= 70 km s@xmath22 mpc@xmath22 .",
    "luminosities will be given in units of erg s@xmath22 and will refer to bolometric luminosities , unless specified otherwise .",
    "we use the term ' ' dex \" to denote the antilogarithm , i.e. @xmath32 dex = 10@xmath47 .",
    "we also define all distribution functions , i.e. the star - forming galaxy mass function @xmath48 , the associated star - forming galaxy black hole mass function @xmath49 , the agn luminosity function @xmath16 and the probability distribution of eddington ratio @xmath40 , in log space .",
    "this leads to power - law exponents that differ by unity relative to distribution functions defined in linear space .",
    "therefore , the units of @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath16 are mpc@xmath50 dex@xmath22 . +",
    "the essence of this phenomenological approach is to make a limited number of simple anstze that allow us to construct a model using analytic techniques , or very elementary numerical modeling , based on straightforward representations of the most important features of the observational data .",
    "these anstze are in a sense `` assumptions '' and a decisive observational disproof of any of them would largely invalidate the model .",
    "clearly they are very unlikely to be exactly true . their value ,",
    "as the basis for a simple `` toy model '' , is that we believe they are likely to be _ broadly _ true .",
    "+ the three anstze in the current work are as follows :    * radiatively efficient agns are found in star - forming galaxies , * the probability distribution of the eddington ratio does not depend on the black hole mass of the system , * the mass of the central black hole is linked to the stellar mass ( @xmath51 ) , with some scatter , and we will for simplicity set @xmath52 .",
    "the justification for the first and the third of these has been reviewed in the introduction and the second is closely related to the assumption of @xcite .",
    "we will justify these , and the choice of @xmath52 , further below .",
    "of course , there are a number of other implicit assumptions that are being made : observational data is not wildly wrong , individual black hole and stellar mass measurements are not systematically biased , the cosmological model is more or less correct and so on .",
    "we will not consider these further .",
    "with our anstze , we can use our knowledge of the mass function of galaxies to construct the black hole mass function . to do this ,",
    "we start with the mass function of star - forming galaxies and then impose a black hole to stellar mass ratio @xmath2 , with an additional log - normal scatter of @xmath53 , to create a black hole mass function in star - forming hosts .",
    "this will serve as the basis for the radiatively efficient agn population . in first part of the paper",
    ", we will set the scatter @xmath54 for initial analytic simplicity , before reintroducing it with @xmath55 when we evaluate the model numerically .",
    "+ if radiatively efficient accretion onto central black holes is only occurring in star - forming hosts , the quasar luminosity function can be created from a convolution of the black hole mass function in star - forming galaxies @xmath56 with a probability distribution of the eddington ratio @xmath23 , @xmath57 where @xmath14 is the resulting qlf , and @xmath58 is the probability distribution of the eddington ratio , @xmath23 , as defined in equation ( [ eq : lumwithed ] ) .      as noted above in equation ( [ eq : createqlf ] ) , the qlf will , with our anstze , be a convolution of the black hole mass function @xmath49 ( itself derived from the stellar mass function of star - forming galaxies @xmath59 ) and the distribution of eddington ratios @xmath40 , which gives the distribution of luminosities for black holes of a given mass . in this section",
    "we look at the general features of the @xmath40 distribution that are needed to produce a double power - law qlf from a schechter - like mass function and derive the connections that will exist between the parameters of these different functions .",
    "+        first , we immediately note that in a model with a mass - independent @xmath40 and an input schechter mass function , the only way to produce a power law at the bright end of the qlf ( with slope @xmath60 ) is to have a @xmath40 that is also a power law of the same slope at high values of the eddington ratio .",
    "this power - law will then ensure that there is a high - end power - law in the qlf even as the mass function drops off exponentially .",
    "this is shown in the appendix .",
    "given the limited dynamic range of the data , other representations of the qlf instead of a double power law are possible , e.g. a log - normal bright end or a modified schechter function ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we choose the conventional double power law for analytic simplicity and because it certainly provides a reasonable representation of the available data .",
    "denoting the slope of the high end of eddington ratio distribution by @xmath61 we can thus equate @xmath62 with @xmath63 the bright end slope of the qlf .",
    "+ at the faint end , we may also expect a power - law qlf but now the qlf faint end slope @xmath64 will be given by the steeper of the low end slope of @xmath49 and the low end slope of @xmath40 , which we denote by @xmath65 ( see also discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : createlf ] illustrates what is happening with faint end of qlf ( with slope ) for different eddington ratio assumptions .",
    "we can express this as @xmath66    the natural conclusion of a mass - independent eddington rate distribution is that the faint end of qlf is set up by either the low end slope of underlying black hole mass function or by the low end slope of the eddington ratio function .",
    "if the logarithmic slope of the @xmath24 vs. @xmath36 relation is @xmath67 as above , then the faint end slope of the black hole mass function will be related to that of the star - forming galaxies by @xmath68 .",
    "+ we note at this point that there is good observational evidence that the faint end qlf slope , @xmath64 , is similar to the observed low mass slope of the mass function of star - forming galaxies , @xmath69 , allowing for the reversal of sign in our definition . the qlf faint end slope , @xmath64 is usually observed to be between 0.3 and 0.9 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand the observed values of @xmath69 range from to -0.6 to -0.2",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) with most newer studies converging around @xmath70 .",
    "+ the data are therefore consistent with the idea that @xmath71 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath72 is indeed being set by the low end slope of the black hole mass function ( and not the low end of the eddington ration distribution ) and further that @xmath52 .",
    "we will henceforth assume that this is the case , i.e. that @xmath73 .",
    "this then means that the low end slope @xmath74 of @xmath40 can take any value that is shallower than this , i.e. @xmath75 .",
    "the high and low end power - laws of the eddington ratio distribution will meet in a knee at a characteristic eddington ratio which we denote by @xmath76 at which point the value of @xmath40 has a characteristic value @xmath77 .",
    "+      to further demonstrate our approach we use the simplest function possible for the eddington ratio distribution that reproduces , analytically , the required broken power law shape of qlf .",
    "we use a `` triangular '' distribution in which some fraction , @xmath78 , of objects are active above a certain threshold value @xmath79 with an eddington ratio distribution that is a single power law with slope @xmath61 , while ( 1-@xmath78 ) of objects are completely inactive .",
    "effectively this sets the low end slope @xmath80 .",
    "+ the exact functional form of @xmath40 can then be written as @xmath81 where @xmath82 in constrained by requirement that all of the objects have to be either active or inactive , so @xmath83 in this case has to integrate to a duty cycle @xmath78 .",
    "+ in an appendix we show that the knee of the qlf , @xmath17 , will be related to the parameters of the original distribution functions through a formula describing the _ population _ which is analogous to equation ( [ eq : lumwithed ] ) of _ individual _ black holes , i.e. @xmath84 where the @xmath85 factor denotes a small multiplicative factor that is weakly dependent on @xmath60 and varying by less than 0.15 dex . + in the same appendix , we also show that the @xmath86 normalization of the qlf , i.e. the value of @xmath87 at @xmath88 will be linked to the normalization of the galaxy mass function @xmath89 and the normalization of the eddington ratio distribution , @xmath82 ,    @xmath90    where the @xmath91 denotes once again a small multiplicative factor , weakly dependent on @xmath60 and varying by less then 0.15 dex .",
    "this is not surprising and is stating the fact that the normalization of objects at given luminosity @xmath17 is connected with the normalization of the contributing functions at @xmath92 and @xmath79 .",
    "simply put , if there are more objects at mass @xmath10 and more of them are active at @xmath93 , then we expect also more objects with corresponding luminosity @xmath17 .",
    "+      even though the triangular distribution of @xmath40 is a simple and analytically tractable one , it is unlikely to describe the real agn population . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we will adopt a more realistic broken power law distribution of eddington ratio given by    @xmath94    where we set @xmath65=0 for further analysis .",
    "this function fits both observations and hydrodynamical simulations better , which show no sudden cutoff in the eddington ratio distribution at some single value ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this distribution diverges logarithmically at the low @xmath23 end .",
    "since the integral of @xmath40 will therefore reach unity at some low value of @xmath95 , all black holes are `` active '' at some very low level and we need no longer consider `` inactive '' ones . + as discussed in section [ sec : convofsch ] , this distribution will also reproduce the same shape of the qlf as the `` triangular '' distribution just discussed , provided that @xmath96 .",
    "+ we note that such a distribution , ( with sharp break at @xmath79 , instead of `` smooth '' version above ) , would naturally arise if individual agn are boosted to some initial eddington ratio above @xmath76 ( the distribution of which is given by @xmath63 ) and thereafter decay exponentially with a constant decay time @xmath97 . in this case",
    ", the concept of `` duty cycle '' @xmath98 in the previous section is replaced by the value of @xmath77 . if the `` boost plus decay '' scenario is relevant",
    ", then it is easy to see that , if agn are activated at some fractional rate @xmath53 per star - forming galaxy per unit time ( e.g. @xcite ) , then    @xmath99    so that @xmath82 is the fraction of black holes that are activated in the time interval corresponding to their subsequent decay time .",
    "this is quite a useful definition of duty cycle .",
    "+ of course , other scenarios could also produce this @xmath40 distribution and a more general `` duty cycle '' could be defined as the fraction of black holes accreting above @xmath76 ( as in the triangular distribution above ) . in this particular case ,",
    "as shown in the appendix , this definition of duty cycle would be given by    @xmath100    the point is that the value of @xmath77 is a good indicator of a generalized duty cycle .",
    "+ if @xmath101 , then the exact choice @xmath40 below @xmath76 is of no great importance to the convolution model and the connections between the parameters , which we can derive analytically in the simplified model as in equations ( [ eq : gamma2 ] ) , ( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) , ( [ eq : lstar ] ) and ( [ eq : phi ] ) will still hold . specifically",
    ", we can write    @xmath102    where we have now also explicitly shown a @xmath65 dependence in the @xmath103 factors , because this corrective factor will also depend on our exact choice of low slope of the eddington ratio distribution . now using the @xmath2 relation",
    ", we can also connect the observed @xmath17 of the qlf to the @xmath10 of the star - forming galaxy mass function with @xmath104          if the qlf is indeed produced by the convolution described in the previous two sections , then we can immediately see in general terms how the mass distribution of agn , or host galaxies of agn , selected at a given luminosity will vary with that selection - luminosity .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : mfagn ] where we show the mass functions of galaxies and black holes .",
    "the masses and number densities are normalized respectively by the @xmath10 and @xmath89 of the input schechter mass function of the star - forming galaxies .",
    "these distributions are plotted for different agn luminosities relative to the knee luminosity @xmath1 in the quasar luminosity functions ( see also equation ( [ eq : qlff ] ) ) . to generate this plot we used the model for @xmath40 considered in the previous section , i.e. with a flat @xmath83 below @xmath76 and with 0.5 dex scatter in the black hole to stellar mass relation . with this normalization",
    "the figures applies at all redshifts .",
    "several points should be noted on this figure .",
    "+ first , all of the mass functions ( of both black holes and host galaxies ) always show a peak at some mass .",
    "this is quite unlike the input mass function of star - forming galaxies , and thus also of black holes , which increase monotonically to lower masses .",
    "the peak arises because the low mass end of the input mass function is modulated by the high @xmath23 part of @xmath40 , simply because it is the highest eddington ratios that pull the lowest mass black holes ( and hosts ) into a given luminosity bin .",
    "the low mass end of these mass distributions should therefore have a slope of @xmath105 , i.e. with @xmath70 and @xmath106 ( see below ) , we predict a low mass slope of + 1.6 .",
    "this is a quite generic and robust prediction of the convolution model and is independent of the choice of @xmath65 , the low @xmath23 behavior of @xmath40 discussed above .",
    "this is because for most luminosities , the _ high _ mass end of the mass functions in figure [ fig : mfagn ] is dominated by the exponential fall - off of the input mass function .",
    "+ second , at high luminosities , above @xmath1 , the effect of the agn luminosity on the host galaxy mass function is to change the numbers of hosts , but not to change the peak mass or , to first order , the shape of the mass function .",
    "this is because of the steep exponential fall off in the input mass function of galaxies above @xmath10 . above @xmath1 ,",
    "the peak host galaxy mass is always close to @xmath19 because there are so few more massive galaxies .",
    "the numbers of @xmath10 galaxies at the peak is determined by how high eddington ratios are required to bring these objects into the luminosity range in question . for these high agn luminosities , the shape of the mass function of ( star - forming ) hosts is very similar to that of passive galaxies except that the faint end slope is significantly steeper ( @xmath107 , with @xmath106 ) that of the passive galaxies which is given by @xmath108 ( see @xcite ) . in mathematical form , the mass function of galaxies at any agn luminosity above @xmath17 will have a schechter shape @xmath109    at lower luminosities , well below @xmath1 , the behaviour changes and a region of intermediate slope appears . for black hole masses between @xmath110 and @xmath111 , the mass function will have the slope given by @xmath112 . at very low masses we will again always recover the slope of @xmath113 .",

    "this produces a peak host galaxy mass of    @xmath114    this difference in behaviour can be understood as follows : in the @xmath115 case the dominant contribution to the luminosity function will come from low mass objects accretion at high eddington ratio which are more numerous than high mass objects accreting at low eddington ratios . in the second case , roles are simply reversed and main contributor to the qlf will be high mass agns with low eddington ratios . +",
    "if black hole masses were very tightly correlated with host galaxy masses , then clearly the same behavior would be seen in the black hole mass function(s ) since these would always be a simple ( mass-)scaling of the galaxy mass function(s )",
    ". however , the effect of scatter in the black hole to host galaxy mass relation is quite marked .",
    "this is visible in figure [ fig : mfagn ] .",
    "the reason is clear : the mass function of black holes will now be much smoother than that of the host galaxies since the log normal scatter smooths out the sharp exponential drop of the galaxies at high masses ( recall that figure 2 used a 0.5 dex scatter ) .",
    "of course , it might be argued that the black hole mass is somehow more fundamental , and that the galaxy mass function should be obtained by smoothing it .",
    "however , we know the galaxy mass function quite well , and it has an exponential cutoff ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we do not , at this stage , know the underlying mass function of black holes in star - forming galaxies . with this scatter ,",
    "there is a much smoother variation of the peak mass with agn luminosity .",
    "+ the dashed lines show the variation of the peak mass with luminosity .",
    "the fact that the difference between these dashed curves on the two panels decreases with luminosity illustrates the well known `` lauer effect '' @xcite whereby the typical objects at high agn luminosities will generally have been scattered above the mean black hole host mass relation .",
    "it should be noted , however , that there is no change in the low mass slope of the mass function(s ) due to scatter and this remains a very robust prediction of our model . + it is worth noting in figure [ fig : mfagn ] that the peak of the black hole mass distribution varies quite weakly with luminosity , i.e. a change in luminosity of 1 dex is associated with a smaller increase in the peak @xmath24 .",

    "there is however complete degeneracy between cases ( a ) and ( c ) , i.e. the distribution of specific accretion rates of agn and the black hole to stellar mass ratio .",

    "this degeneracy can only be broken if we have information on the black hole masses of the agn .",

    "we recreate data only up to @xmath168 , as black hole mass estimates for higher redshifts are based on the broad c iv emission line , which was shown to be far less reliable for these purposes ( @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "+ we first show in the topmost panels of the figure [ fig : lm1p2z0 ] the modelled distribution of quasars in the black hole mass - luminosity @xmath169 plane in 3 representative redshift bins if we assume a redshift independent @xmath2 with the standard value of @xmath170 .",

    "systems of lower fwhm will not appear in the samples , e.g. the limit used in @xcite is set at 1200 km / s .",
    "+ we see that , although there is good agreement at low redshifts , a non - evolving @xmath2 relation produces far too many objects with masses that are too small or , equivalently , which have very high eddington ratios , with around 50@xmath172 being super - eddington in the final redshift bin , while only around 2@xmath172 of objects are super - eddington in the data .",
    "this is a simple consequence of the fact that @xmath17 is much higher then locally and is a reflection of the high @xmath76 implied for an unevolving @xmath2 relation shown in figure [ fig : g21pz2 ] .",
    "+ it should be noted that the problem gets worse if we reduce the scatter in the @xmath2 relation as we then have even fewer high mass black holes .",
    "we note that the comparison could not be expected to be perfect because our data is constrained to reproduce the qlf from @xcite ; although sdss data and the optical qlf is the main contributor to the hopkins qlf in this luminosity range , there are small contributions from other surveys as well as slightly different bolometric and obscuration corrections which will induce small differences . nevertheless , the disagreement with a non - evolving @xmath2 ratio is too large to be due to this . +",
    "a much better agreement is obtained ( second row of figure [ fig : lm1p2z0 ] ) if we adopt an evolving @xmath2 relation .",
    "we adopt as a heuristic example the form @xmath173 with @xmath174 . the agreement with the observed",
    "distribution is considerably better and there are now far fewer objects crossing the eddington limit ( @xmath9 3 @xmath175 ) at high redshifts .",
    "this means that the observed @xmath176 increase in @xmath177 back to @xmath8 would be due to an equal split between a @xmath178 change in @xmath2 and a @xmath178 change in characteristic eddington ratio @xmath76 , remembering that these two changes are degenerate in our convolution model without the @xmath2 data of figure [ fig : lm1p2z0 ] .",
    "+ finally we note that , quite independently of any assumptions about @xmath2 , our convolution model naturally recreates the apparent `` sub - eddington boundary '' that has been emphasized by @xcite , by which we mean the flat upper envelope .",
    "this refers to the fact that at all redshifts there seems to be a lack of objects at high masses close to the eddington limit , which can also be seen in the figure 16 of @xcite .",
    "this can be observed on the figure [ fig : lm1p2z0 ] where the upper contours of the red regions have slopes that are noticeably shallower than the 45 degree slope that corresponds to a constant eddington ratio , thereby giving the impression of an absence of high luminosity high @xmath23 sources .",
    "+ this behaviour is quite counter - intuitive , and was interpreted by @xcite as being caused by some new physical effect that somehow limits accretion onto more luminous quasars .",
    "various authors have proposed alterations to the measurement methods in mass - luminosity plane which could reduce or eliminate this effect ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we show instead that this behaviour is actually expected from the convolution model presented in this paper ! + we commented earlier in section [ sec : pred ] that while the typical black hole mass increases with luminosity in our convolution model , it does so sub - linearly , so that the `` typical '' eddington ratio must also increase with luminosity .",
    "this can be seen also in these plots : the ridge line that is defined by the peak in the mass distribution _ at a given @xmath21 _ is indeed _ steeper _ than the 45 degree line of constant eddington ratio , which is why the _ shallower _ slope of the boundary defined by the contours is so counter - intuitive .",
    "however , because the _ number _ of more massive black holes falls very steeply with mass , because of the decline of the galactic mass function above @xmath19 , the contours of _ constant surface density _ , given by the contours in the plots in figure [ fig : lm1p2z0 ] and in the @xcite analysis , are actually _ shallower _ than the 45 degree line .",
    "+ this is more clearly seen in figure [ fig : lm1p2z2full ] were we show the appearance of our full sample , before the application of the sdss luminosity cut . at lower luminosities",
    "the effect gets more and more pronounced and we expect that deeper surveys of a given area would find more super - eddington objects at small masses .",
    "+ we emphasize that the reproduction of the @xcite effect in figure [ fig : lm1p2z0 ] is achieved within our convolution model with an eddington ratio distribution @xmath40 that is completely _ independent _ of black hole mass .",
    "the effect noted by @xcite would not be seen ( in our model ) if the distribution of points in the @xmath169 plane was normalized to the total number of black holes ( in star - forming galaxies ) at a given _ mass _ , which is , of course , unfortunately not observable .",
    "our explanation for the sub - eddington boundary in @xcite is therefore a kind of `` plotting bias '' arising from what is plotted , rather than a `` selection effect '' per se , coming through the construction of the sample via , e.g. , emission line widths .",
    "+          in this section we show how it is possible to reproduce the observed tight correlation between @xmath179 in the local universe even if the black hole to stellar mass relation in the star - forming galaxies is strongly evolving ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) . in what follows",
    ", we loosely equate @xmath27 with the stellar mass of a star - forming galaxy when star - formation quenches , which is also the point at which we assume the black hole ceases growing .",
    "readers uncomfortable with making this association may simply substitute @xmath27 in what follows with @xmath180 .",
    "+        for this analysis , we use results from the simple galaxy evolution model of @xcite to construct a set of evolving star - forming galaxies and their quenched descendants .",
    "the details of the @xcite model are not important for the present purpose since it reproduces well the overall evolution of the galaxy population , which is all that we require here .",
    "+ for each quenched galaxy seen in the model at the present epoch , we know the mass and redshift at which it quenched and can therefore compute the black hole mass from the adopted redshift - dependent @xmath2 relation for ( star - forming ) galaxies , adding also the adopted scatter .",
    "we assume that there is no stellar mass growth after quenching and that there is no central smbh mass growth after quenching + after this procedure we are left with a mock sample of quenched galaxies , with their black hole masses known , after which we can account for sample selection effects .",
    "this is not trivial , as measurements of masses of black holes are from heterogeneous sources and no single luminosity or other cut is possible .",
    "+ we therefore decided to create an empirical selection in galaxy mass so that the distribution of galaxy masses in the mock sample broadly matches that of the passive early type galaxies which have had their smbh mass measured .",
    "we show results for two situations , where we first only consider galaxies that quenched after @xmath181 and then include all galaxies that have quenched since @xmath182 .",
    "we differentiate between these two cases since we expect merging , which is not explicitly accounted for here , to have a larger impact for galaxies that quench earlier , and because the assumed mass ratio scaling , which we think is reasonable approximation ( see above ) at redshift @xmath183 , may break down at higher redshifts .",
    "when we ignore quenching at @xmath184 , we are losing only about 10% of today s quenched population , but the model is on a much firmer footing .",
    "+ we have fitted the simulated data , derived from 40 random realizations of the model , with a relation of the form @xmath185 by regressing the black hole mass on the stellar mass , and compute the scatter of the simulated galaxies around this relation .",
    "we derive values of @xmath186 and a scatter of 0.53 dex for the case of quenching only from z=2 , and values of @xmath187 with scatter of 0.6 dex for the case of quenching from z=5 .",
    "these values should be compared with the observed values of @xmath188 and a intrinsic scatter of 0.29 dex derived in @xcite .",
    "while the predicted scatter appears to be slightly larger than observed , subsequent merging of galaxies , that has not been modelled here , will act to reduce the scatter ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "+ the origin of @xmath179 relation is the underlying @xmath2 relation in star - forming galaxies assumed in the model , with added scatter due to the fact that galaxies of a given stellar mass today have quenched at various redshifts and , for a given stellar mass , the spread in black hole masses is amplified by spread in the quenching redshifts .",
    "the mean of the @xmath179relation is positioned roughly at the value of @xmath2 at the mean redshift of quenching at that mass , which is @xmath189 over a wide range of galaxy masses . + it is interesting to note that objects that have quenched more recently would be expected on average to have a lower @xmath2 value , because of the evolution in @xmath2",
    ". it is possible that these recently quenched galaxies could be associated with pseudo - bulges instead of bulges .",

    ", there could well be other causes for @xmath2 to evolve as @xmath178 , in which case the tight @xmath25 relation would simply be a coincidence . +      finally , we turn to estimates of the @xmath2 relations for agns in the local universe , where it is possible to estimate independently the mass of the galaxy that is hosting an optically active agn .",
    "@xcite made a careful decomposition into nuclear and host contributions of the images of @xmath194 quasars in the sdss stripe 82 .",

    "we discuss this further in section [ subsec : lowredmstar ] below .",
    "in the preceding sections of this paper we have developed a simple generic model for obtaining the evolving agn luminosity function from a convolution of the evolving galaxy mass function .",
    "this generic model makes testable predictions for quantities such as the shape of the mass distribution of host galaxies as a function of agn luminosity and allows us to derive quantitative connections between the parameters describing the galaxy mass function and the agn qlf .",
    "on the basis of these , we can derive powerful statements about the duty cycle of agn .",
    "we then showed , in the framework of this general model , that a redshift - dependent @xmath2 and eddington ratio distribution , @xmath40 , successfully reproduces the observed quasar luminosity function ( by construction ) and also reproduces observations of the distribution of quasars in the ( @xmath200 ) plane , the black hole to bulge mass relation of quenched galaxies and measurements of @xmath2 for low redshift agn . in this discussion section , we develop further some of the astrophysical implications of the preceding results .",
    "it is important to appreciate that a quite rapid evolution in @xmath2 in _ active _ ( star - forming ) agn systems does not imply an equally rapid evolution of @xmath2 in the _ quenched _ systems .",
    "this is because , when we are observing quenched systems , we are effectively observing the integrated history of previous activity . to illustrate this",
    ", we perform a simple heuristic exercise in which we determine @xmath2 in quenched systems at given epoch , assuming as above that quenching started at redshift 2 .",
    "we make the same assumptions as before , namely that there is no stellar or black hole mass growth after quenching . + our results are shown in figure [ fig : bul ] .",
    "even though star - forming galaxies have changed their black - hole to stellar mass ratio by almost a factor of 10 from redshift @xmath8 to today , the evolution in this ratio for _ quenched _ systems is much milder , more like a factor of 3 or even less ( 0.4 dex ) , simply because the quenched population includes galaxies that have quenched much earlier .",
    "this means that the redshift evolution in @xmath2 for quenched systems will always be much milder than the evolution in this quantity in active systems .",
    "+ the distinction between active and passive populations becomes even more important if observational studies compare actively accreting systems at high redshift with data on the quiescent population at low redshift .",

    "it is therefore clear that the mean @xmath2 relation in the quenched systems will reflect the mass ratio in the star - forming galaxies at the much earlier epochs when those galaxies actually quenched ( as already discussed above ) . for the local population",

    "+ clearly , if we compare the @xmath2 of star forming systems at z @xmath9 1 - 1.5 to the @xmath2 ratio of passive galaxies seen today that quenched at z @xmath9 1 - 1.5 , then we would expect to see no change in @xmath2 , even if this ratio had changed a lot within the actively accreting population ! of course ,",
    "if the high redshift active systems are luminosity - selected then their @xmath2 ratio will likely have been biassed to higher values than the underlying population through the `` lauer effect '' discussed in section 3.4 , which goes in the opposite direction ( as shown by the parallel black lines in figure [ fig : bul ] ) .",
    "this figure shows that if nature has an underlying @xmath2 scaling as @xmath178 for active systems , then we would expect to see @xmath201 if we compare comparisons of active systems at @xmath8 with quenched systems at @xmath202 , once we correct for these observational biases .",
    "this is quite similar to the evolution seen in at least some of the observational studies cited above ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . +",
    "we have already commented in section [ sec : quench ] that we would also expect to see little or no evolution in @xmath5 for any population of galaxies , however selected .",

    "the evolution in @xmath2 for the quenched ( inactive nuclei ) galaxies is always shallower than for the population of actively accreting systems , potentially leading to an underestimate of the evolution if the populations are mixed .",
    "on the other hand , the `` lauer effect '' will bias the @xmath2 upwards in luminosity selected active samples , which goes in the opposite direction .",

    "we have shown that it is possible to reproduce the strong observed redshift evolution in the qlf with a model based on the observed mass function of star - forming galaxies coupled with a _ mass - independent _ ( but redshift - dependent ) eddington ratio distribution @xmath167 .",
    "this is shown more explicitly in figure [ fig : hasinger ] where we show the comoving number density of quasars of different luminosity in the qlf which is reproduced by our model .",
    "this emphasizes that the apparent down - sizing signature in the agn population can appear even though the distribution of eddington ratios ( and thus of specific black hole growth rates ) is strictly _ independent _ of black hole mass at all redshifts in our model .",
    "+ it is clear that the apparent `` downsizing '' in our model arises as a natural consequence of two competing effects which are independent of mass .",
    "the first is the redshift evolution of the @xmath1 which shifts the luminosity function _ uniformly _ in luminosity , but which therefore produces a differential change in number density with luminosity .",
    "this shift is produced by the degenerate combination of evolution of the @xmath2 mass ratio and characteristic eddington ratio , @xmath79 .",
    "the second is the redshift evolution of @xmath154 that changes the number densities _ uniformly _ with luminosity .",
    "we have argued in this work that the evolution of @xmath154 is a direct consequence of the evolution of @xmath135 , coupled with a constant duty cycle . the combination of these two produces variation in the number density ( at fixed luminosity ) that changes with luminosity , producing a variation in the redshift of the peak in the number density as well as different rates of evolution at different luminosities .",
    "one of the most striking results of this paper is that the observed evolution of @xmath86 of the qlf tracks the observed evolution of @xmath89 of the star - forming galaxy mass function .",
    "this in turn implies that the @xmath215 knee of the eddington ratio distribution @xmath40 has a more or less constant value , even though the change of the characteristic @xmath76 `` knee '' is dramatic .",
    "we have argued that @xmath215 is a good measure of a generalized `` duty cycle '' of quasars .",
    "indeed , if the luminosity of individual quasars decays with a timescale @xmath97 then ( equation [ fd ] ) @xmath77 will be direct measure of the birth - rate of quasars in star - forming galaxies .",
    "+ by applying simple continuity equations to the observed evolution of the star - forming galaxy mass function , @xcite derived an expression for the rate of the mass - quenching process , @xmath216 , which may be written    @xmath217    where ssfr(z ) is the redshift dependent specific star - formation rate of the star - forming main sequence .",
    "it has been well established that ssfr was much higher in the past and a useful representation is ( @xcite and references therein )    @xmath218    agn activity in `` quasar - mode '' is one of the many processes that have been proposed ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) to drive the mass - quenching of galaxies .",

    "we could well expect the physics of quenching to be more complex .",
    "it is quite plausible that the energy source for quenching is agn activity but that the effectiveness of this energy injection depends on the stellar or halo mass of the system ( the @xcite quenching law can be written in terms of a redshift - independent survival probability that depends only on mass ) .",

    "+ our simple convolution model makes clear and testable predictions for the distribution of host galaxy masses ( relative to the star - forming galaxy schechter @xmath19 ) for different agn luminosities ( relative to @xmath1 ) . at high luminosities ( above the agn @xmath1 )",
    "this is a schechter function with the star - forming m * but a faint end slope given by @xmath222 .",
    "2 .   there is a remarkable consistency in the redshift evolution of @xmath89 normalization of sf mass function and the @xmath86 normalization of qlf .",
    "these two characteristic densities track each other closely out to redshifts of @xmath162 , and possibly to even higher redshifts .",
    "this implies that the generalised `` duty cycle '' of agn is surprisingly constant with redshift .",
    "3 .   in contrast",
    ", the qlf @xmath17 evolves strongly with redshift , with evolution being at least @xmath223 up to @xmath8 .",

    "the qlf evolution is degenerate in changes of these two quantities .",
    "we then explore this degeneracy by comparing predictions of our model , incorporating the relevant selection cuts , for the distribution of systems in the sdss agn mass - luminosity plane(s ) using black hole mass estimates for individual agn .",
    "we find a good match with an evolving @xmath214 in star - forming systems .",
    "this implies that the observed @xmath176 increase in @xmath177 back to @xmath8 would be due to an equal split between a @xmath178 change in @xmath2 and a @xmath178 change in characteristic eddington ratio @xmath76 .",
    "+ we show that this is compatible with the observed @xmath221 relations in both quenched and in star - forming galaxies in the local universe , both in terms of the mean relations and the scatter .",
    "+ we also make the important point that much weaker evolution , more like @xmath224 , would be deduced by observers , after correcting for the `` lauer bias '' , if ( as they usually of necessity do ) they compare black hole masses in active ( star - forming ) systems at high redshift ( @xmath8 ) with those in quiescent systems at low redshift .",
    "similarly , much weaker evolution would also be seen if black hole masses were to be compared solely within the passive population at different redshifts .",
    "+ the inferred @xmath214 evolution in star - forming systems is likely simplistic , and unlikely to hold all the way down to the lowest redshifts simply because there is not enough star - formation to change @xmath36 fast enough , even if black holes are not growing at all .",
    "our use of a @xmath212 evolutionary model should be interpreted more loosely as a way of getting a factor of 2.5 change between @xmath2 in _ active _ systems at @xmath8 when compared with the same relation in _ passive _ systems today , rather than as a precise relation that absolutely holds at all redshifts .",
    "+ we however make the interesting point that an evolution of the form @xmath214 would , when coupled with the observed changes in the sizes of galaxies , which typically scale as roughly @xmath225 , have the feature of producing a @xmath5 relation that would be more or less _ independent _ of redshift .",
    "this could then explain why the present - day @xmath5 relation would have lower scatter than the @xmath2 relation , even if @xmath7 plays no direct role in black hole growth .",
    "alternatively , a fundamental redshift - independent @xmath5 relation could be the physical origin of an apparent @xmath214 evolution .",
    "+ we stress that the most basic features of the model do not depend on the redshift dependence of @xmath226 , which is driven largely by the possibly uncertain observational estimates of black hole masses in high redshift agn . + not least , quite independent of the form of any evolution in @xmath2 , the generic model naturally reproduces the counter - intuitive `` sub - eddington boundary '' in the ( @xmath227 ) plane that has been noted by @xcite without the need to invoke any new physical effects .",
    "the generic model also produces the apparent `` down - sizing '' of the agn population ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "this can again be seen in figure [ fig : doubepowerlawconv2 ] , where we also show results of fitting with eddington ratio distribution which has sharp break at @xmath79 , i.e. @xmath252",
    "in this section we wish to point out one interesting and suggestive fact that arises from fits that were discussed in section [ sec : comparing ] .",

    "we can plot an equivalent diagram in the ( @xmath256 ) plane by converting @xmath254 to @xmath79 using an @xmath221 ratio and equation ( [ eq : masterl ] ) and setting @xmath257 ( equation ( [ eq : gamma2 ] ) ) .",

    "would have to steepen , so as to get down to zero at the limiting @xmath259 .",
    "an interesting question is then whether we can find an evolving ( i.e. redshift - dependent ) @xmath221 ratio that will cause the `` up '' and `` down '' tracks in figure [ fig : g21pz2 ] to lie on top of each other .",
    "we find that introducing @xmath260 produces a good congruence in the ( @xmath256 ) tracks associated with the rise and decline of @xmath1 .",
    "this is shown in the right hand panel , where we show the ( @xmath256 ) tracks obtained by using @xmath261 .",
    "the congruence with this particular @xmath2 evolution is suggestive but can not be taken as a strong indication of this particular evolution of @xmath262 + however , the values of @xmath76 that are implied ( in our convolution model ) at high redshifts by the high @xmath1 are getting uncomfortably high , unless there is a strong increase in @xmath2 relative to the canonical zero redshift value of @xmath198 , as can be seen on the right hand plot of figure [ fig : g21pz2 ] . with @xmath212 evolution , @xmath76 is implied to be -0.8 dex at @xmath8 , but without this evolution , @xmath76 is implied to be + 0.15 dex , i.e. above the eddington limit !",
    "this would mean that the characteristic eddington ratio at this redshift would be above eddington limit , with many of the objects being super - eddington . both observations and theoretical work suggests that the fraction of agns which cross this limit is small ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ."
