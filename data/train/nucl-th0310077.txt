    "the molecular - like picture as well as the single - particle picture are fundamental viewpoints to understand the structure of light nuclei.@xcite it is well known that the structure of many states in light nuclei is described successfully by the microscopic cluster model , where a group of nucleons is assumed to form a localized substructure ( cluster ) , interacting with other clusters and/or nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "the predominant cluster is the @xmath0 nucleus , which plays an important role in the cluster model , because it is the lightest and also smallest shell - closed nucleus with a binding energy as large as 28 mev , reflecting the strong four - nucleon correlation .",
    "molecular - like states in nuclei are expected to appear around the threshold energy of breakup into constituent clusters @xcite , because the intercluster binding is weak in the cluster states .",
    "for example , the ground state of @xmath8be and the second @xmath9 state of @xmath3c are known @xcite to have loosely bound @xmath10 and @xmath11 structures , respectively , which appear around the @xmath10 and @xmath11 thresholds .",
    "special attention has been paid to such four - nucleon correlations corresponding to an @xmath0-type condensation in symmetric nuclear matter , similar to the bose - einstein condensation for finite number of dilute bosonic atoms such as @xmath12rb or @xmath13na at very low temperature  @xcite .",
    "several authors have discussed the possibility of @xmath0-particle condensation in low - density nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "they found that such @xmath0 condensation can occur in the low - density region below a fifth of the saturation density , although the ordinary pairing correlation can prevail at higher density .",
    "the result indicates that @xmath0 condensate states in finite nuclear system may exist in excited states of dilute density composed of weakly interacting gas of @xmath0 particles .",
    "thus , it is an interesting subject to study the structure of light nuclei from the viewpoint of @xmath0-particle condensation .",
    "recently , a new @xmath0-cluster wave function was proposed which is of the @xmath2-particle condensate type @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the @xmath0-particle creation operator , @xmath16 denotes the internal wave function of the @xmath0 cluster , @xmath17 is the center - of - mass coordinate of the _ i_-th @xmath0 cluster , and @xmath18 presents the antisymmetrization operator among the constituent nucleons . the important characteristic in eq .",
    "( [ wf ] ) is that the center - of - mass motion of each @xmath0 cluster is of @xmath19-wave type with the independent size parameter @xmath20 .",
    "applications of the condensate - type wave function to @xmath3c and @xmath21o showed that the second @xmath9 state of @xmath3c ( @xmath22=7.65 mev ) and fifth @xmath9 states of @xmath21o ( @xmath22=14.0 mev ) , located around the @xmath11- and @xmath23-particle thresholds , respectively , are specified by the @xmath2 condensate state , which is quite similar to the bose - einstein condensation of bosonic atoms in magnetic traps where all atoms occupy the lowest @xmath19-orbit.@xcite the calculated root - mean - square ( rms ) radius for those condensate states is about 4 fm , which is much much larger than that for the ground state ( about 2.7 fm ) .",
    "as for @xmath8be , the @xmath0-particle wave function in eqs .",
    "( [ c_dager ] ) and ( [ wf ] ) , taking into account the axially symmetric deformation , was applied to investigate the rotational structure of the ground - band states ( @xmath9-@xmath24-@xmath25 ) @xcite .",
    "it was found that the rotational character of the @xmath8be ground state band is reproduced nicely by this wave function with deformation @xcite .    the above - mentioned theoretical results for @xmath8be , @xmath3c and",
    "@xmath21o lead us to conjecture that such dilute @xmath0-cluster states near the @xmath2 threshold may also occur in other heavier @xmath1 self - conjugate nuclei .",
    "the coulomb potential barrier should play an important role to confine such dilute @xmath2-particle states , as inferred from the analyses of the @xmath8be , @xmath3c and @xmath21o nuclei .",
    "in fact , the ground state of @xmath8be , which appears at @xmath26 kev referring to the @xmath10 threshold , exists as a resonant state with very narrow width , due to the coulomb potential barrier , whose height is estimated to be @xmath27 mev .",
    "this self - trapping of @xmath0-particles by the coulomb barriers is in contrast to the case of the dilute neutral atomic condensate states , where the atoms are trapped by the external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "it is an intriguing problem and of interest to study how many @xmath0 particles can be bound in the dilute nuclear system .",
    "increasing the number of @xmath0 clusters , the rms radius of the system should become gradually larger , because the dilute character must be retained .",
    "then , the total kinetic energy of the @xmath2 system becomes significantly smaller in comparison with the potential energy , similar to the case of bosonic atoms in the condensed state .",
    "in addition , the height of the coulomb potential barrier will become steadily lower .",
    "this is due to the following reasons .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath0 nuclear potential is short - ranged , while the coulomb potential is long - ranged . increasing the number of the @xmath0 particles , the repulsive contribution from the coulomb potentials prevails gradually over the attractive one from the @xmath0-@xmath0 nuclear potentials , because the gas - like @xmath2 system is expanding in such a way that the rms radius between two @xmath0 particles is gradually getting larger .",
    "this means that the height of the potential barrier confining the gas - like @xmath2 particles becomes lower with increasing @xmath7 , and then , there should exist a critical number ( @xmath28 ) beyond which the @xmath2 system can not sustain itself as a bound nuclear state .",
    "thus , it is interesting to estimate the number of @xmath29 as well as to study the structure of the dilute @xmath2 system up to @xmath28 . since the application of the condensate - type wave function in eqs .",
    "( [ c_dager ] ) and ( [ wf ] ) to the general @xmath2 system is not easy and the computational limitation is @xmath30 at most , we need to study them with phenomenological models .    in this paper ,",
    "the gas - like @xmath2 cluster states are studied with the following two approaches : the gross - pitaevskii - equation approach and hill - wheeler - equation approach .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii equation , which is of the nonlinear - schrdinger - type , was proposed about fifty years ago to describe the single - boson motion in the dilute atomic condensate state  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments starting from the middle of 1990 s have succeeded in realizing such a condensate state consisting of @xmath31-@xmath32 neutral atoms trapped by the magnetic field at very low temperature .",
    "many characteristic aspects of the dilute states are described successfully by the gross - pitaevskii equation  @xcite .",
    "thus , its application to the dilute @xmath2 nuclear systems is also very promising , and we expect from such a study useful information on the condensed states . on the other hand , we here propose also a different approach .",
    "although the gross - pitaevskii equation is simple and interesting for the study of the structure of the dilute @xmath2 system , the center - of - mass motion in the @xmath2 system is not completely removed in this framework .",
    "the effect of the center - of - mass motion should be non - negligible to the total energy and rms radius etc .  for small numbers of @xmath0 bosons .",

    "the two different approaches , the gross - pitaevskii - equation approach and the hill - wheeler - equation approach , are complementary to one another , and we will obtain useful understanding of the dilute multi @xmath0-particle states . starting from @xmath8be , the structure of the gas - like @xmath2 boson systems with @xmath5 is investigated and the critical number @xmath29 is estimated with those two different approaches .    the paper is organized as follows . we formulate in sec .",

    "the use of such a soft - core - type @xmath10 potential is suitable in the present study , because we discuss the gas - like @xmath2 states , where the pauli blocking effect between two @xmath0 particles is considerably weakened .",
    "the important point for the determination of the potential parameters , other than the condition of reproducing the experimental resonant energy for the @xmath8be ground state , is that the @xmath0-@xmath0 wave function for the resonant state , should have a loosely - bound structure of the two @xmath0 particles . according to many structure calculations of @xmath8be",

    "this indicates that the thomas - fermi approximation , neglecting the kinetic energy term , is roughly realized in the system .",
    "consequently , there appears the flat potential region in the single @xmath0 potential , whose behavior is similar to the dilute atomic condensate state trapped by the magnetic fields at very low temperature @xcite . on the other hand , the appearance of the coulomb potential barrier plays an important role in confining the @xmath0 bosons in the inside region .",
    "it is noted that the barrier comes out naturally from the self - consistent calculation of the gross - pitaevskii equation . the single @xmath0 particle energy for the @xmath11 and @xmath23 systems are smaller than the coulomb potential barrier .",

    "when the dilute @xmath2 system is inflating with @xmath7 and the distance between two @xmath0 bosons is getting larger , the contribution from the long - range potential should overcome steadily the one from the short - range one .",

    "in such a critical system , the behavior of the wave functions in the outer ( inner ) region is very sensitive ( not very sensitive ) to how to solve the equations and to obtain the wavefunctions .",
    "the value of the rms radius ( total energy ) is generally sensitive ( not very sensitive ) to the behavior of the wave function in the outer region .",

    "let us consider the effective energy of the @xmath131 system in the dilute @xmath2 state , which corresponds to the quantity of the total energy of the @xmath2 state divided by the number of @xmath0 pairs which is given in table  [ tab:4 ] .",
    "since the dilute character allows us to neglect approximately the kinetic energy , the effective energy of the @xmath131 system could be given mainly as the sum of the @xmath10 nuclear potential energy and its coulomb potential energy ( the contribution from the @xmath11 potential may be neglected approximately because of the very small amount ) . figure  [ fig:8 ] shows the @xmath10 potential used in the present study , where we also show the @xmath10 nuclear potential [ see eq .",

    "( [ coulomb_pot ] ) ] .",
    "the attraction of the former is largest around 4 fm and is negligible beyond about 7 fm , while the coulomb potential is long - ranged and its repulsion is substantial even beyond 7 fm .",
    "increasing the number of the @xmath0 particles , the gas - like @xmath2 system is expanding and the rms distance between two @xmath0 particles is also becoming larger ( @xmath132 fm ) in the case of @xmath130 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] .",
    "then , the attractive contribution from the @xmath10 nuclear potential to the effective @xmath131 energy should become noticeably smaller with increasing @xmath7 , reflecting the short - range ( attractive ) behavior of the potential . the repulsive contribution from the coulomb potential , however , should not be much smaller than in the case of the @xmath10 nuclear potential , and dominate over the contribution from the nuclear potential , because of the long - range ( repulsive ) behavior .",
    "these facts explain the raise of the effective @xmath131 energy with @xmath7 , which means that the energy of the dilute @xmath2 states increases with @xmath7 and does not stay around the threshold energy . in table",
    "[ tab:4 ] we can find quantitatively the increase of the effective @xmath10 system with @xmath7 .",
    "the gradual dominance of the total coulomb potential energy over the total @xmath10 nuclear potential energy in the @xmath2 system can be also seen in table  [ tab:4 ] .",
    "it is interesting to see the role of the @xmath11 potentials in the dilute @xmath2 system . from table",
    "[ tab:4 ] , the contribution to the total energy is small in the case of @xmath3c and @xmath21o , while it gives a non - negligible effect with increasing @xmath7 , as seen in table  [ tab:3 ] , because it is proportional to the number of @xmath95 .",
    "in fact , the energy @xmath133 becomes steadily larger with the number of @xmath0 bosons , although the quantity of the energy divided by the number of trios of the @xmath0 bosons is decreasing with @xmath7 , reflecting the fact that the @xmath2 system is expanding with @xmath7 .",
    "it is instructive to study the case of no @xmath11 potentials within the present framework .",
    "the calculated results show that the @xmath2 system gradually falls into a collapsed state with increasing @xmath7 as discussed before ; for example , @xmath134 mev and @xmath135 fm for @xmath136 .",
    "the result tells us that the dilute @xmath0 boson states appear under the cooperative work between the two - body and three - body potentials in the present model .    finally , we estimate the critical number @xmath29 of the dilute @xmath2 state beyond which the system is unbound .",
    "since the critical state should be very unstable , it is difficult to determine it exactly with the present hill - wheeler - equation approach .",
    "however , we can deduce it approximately from studying the stability of the calculated eigen energies and rms radii against changing the model space determined by the gaussian size parameters in eqs .",
    "( [ gs_para_1 ] ) and ( [ gs_para_3 ] ) .",
    "the procedure is as follows .",
    "the present framework is able to describe dilute states trapped by the coulomb barrier under the condition that we choose the range of the gaussian size parameters wide enough to cover a configuration space over the whole rms radius of the states .",
    "if the state is stable or relatively stable , the calculated energies and rms radii are not changed very much against the variation of the gaussian size parameters .",
    "otherwise , those depend sensitively on the choice of the parameters . using the wide model space , however",
    ", a special attention must be paid to investigate the eigen - states obtained from the hill - wheeler equation , because a discretized continuum state , which is unphysical , has a chance to become the lowest state in energy in the present variational calculation .",
    "we can easily identify it by investigating the behavior of its energy and/or rms radius against changing the gaussian size parameters .",
    "the unphysical state usually has an abnormally long rms radius , which is a little smaller than or almost the same as the value of @xmath137 or @xmath138 in eqs .",

    "the calculated energies and rms radii for the dilute @xmath2 states with @xmath139 are almost the same for both the parameter sets a and b , while we see some discrepancies in those with @xmath140 , in particular , in the rms radii , for the two parameter sets .",
    "even if we use other gaussian size parameter sets which cover the configuration space over the rms radius for the dilute states , the results obtained are found to be similar to those mentioned above .",
    "thus , the critical number of the dilute @xmath2 boson systems is estimated roughly to be @xmath6 , namely , @xmath4ca , in the present study .",
    "it is noted that the number is the same as that in the spherical case as well as in the gross - pitaevskii - equation approach .",
    "the dilute @xmath2 cluster condensate states with @xmath5 have been studied with the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gp ) and the hill - wheeler equation ( hw ) , where the @xmath0 cluster is treated as a structureless boson .",
    "two kinds of effective @xmath0-@xmath0 potentials were used : the density - dependent @xmath0-@xmath0 potential ( dd ) and the phenomenological @xmath10 potential plus 3-body @xmath0 potential ( pp ) , and we also included the folded coulomb potential between the @xmath10 bosons . both potentials ( only the latter ) were ( was ) applied to study the structure of the spherical ( spherical and axially deformed ) dilute @xmath2 states with the gross - pitaevskii equation ( hill - wheeler equation ) .",

    "they are common to all of the four different frameworks .",
    "the reason of why the total energy of the gas - like @xmath2 state increases gradually with @xmath7 and do not remain around their @xmath2 threshold values is understood as the competition between the nuclear @xmath0-@xmath0 nuclear potential ( attractive ) and its coulomb potential ( repulsive ) .",
    "in fact , increasing the number of @xmath7 , the @xmath0-@xmath0 distance is becoming larger ( @xmath141 fm for @xmath120 ) , and then the contribution from the @xmath0-@xmath0 nuclear potential per @xmath10 pair in the dilute @xmath2 state is decreasing rapidly because of the short - range character , while that from the coulomb one is decreasing very slowly and remains almost constant for @xmath142 , reflecting the @xmath143 character of the coulomb potential .",

    "the origin of the appearance of the flat region is mainly due to the validity of the thomas - fermi approximation , namely , the neglect of the contribution from kinetic energy because of the dilute character of the @xmath2 system . the result is analogous to the dilute atomic condensate state trapped by the magnetic fields at very low temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "the results for the total energy and rms radius were quite similar for the above - mentioned two frameworks except for @xmath7=3 and 4 .",
    "the result might indicate that the dilute @xmath2 states with @xmath111 are not very sensitive to the details of the effective @xmath0-@xmath0 potential ( dd or pp ) .",
    "3 )  comparing the results from the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gp ) and hill - wheeler equation ( hw ) , we could see the effect of the neglect of the center - of - mass motion in the gross - pitaevskii equation and also the usefulness of the hill - wheeler - equation approach for describing the dilute @xmath2 system . in the small - number @xmath2 systems ,",
    "the effect was found to be non - negligible , in particular , for the rms radius , while there is less than about 10  % deviation for the @xmath118 systems .",

    "in fact , the energy gain and reduction of the rms radius due to the deformation are @xmath144 mev and @xmath145 % , respectively , for the former system . due to the effect , the calculated results of the total energy and rms radius for @xmath7=3 and 4 in the ( hw , pp , d ) framework are improved from those in the ( hw , pp , s ) framework , and give a good correspondence with those for the condensate @xmath0 cluster states discussed by tohsaki et al .  @xcite the present result that the dilute @xmath2 states ( @xmath5 ) may be deformed is natural , taking into account the fact that a gas - like @xmath2 state with relatively small number of @xmath0 s could easily be deformed .    5 )",

    "all of the frameworks indicated that the number is roughly @xmath6 , which is not strongly dependent on the frameworks .",
    "thus , we concluded that the dilute @xmath2 cluster states could exist in the @xmath3c to @xmath4ca systems with @xmath5 , whose energies vary from threshold up to about 20 mev in the present calculation .",
    "the estimate of @xmath6 is of course subject to the validity of our phenomenological approach treating the @xmath0-particles as ideal bosons . we , however , believe , for reasons outlined in the paper , that our estimate for @xmath29 may be correct to within @xmath146  % . in any case",
    "the value for @xmath29 , _ i.e. _ the maximum of @xmath0-particles in the condensate state is relatively modest .",
    "a very interesting question in this context is whether adding a few neutrons may stabilize the condensate and thus allow for much higher numbers of condensed @xmath0 s .",
    "one should remember that @xmath8be is ( slightly ) unbound whereas @xmath147be and @xmath148be are bound .",
    "concerning experimental detection of the @xmath0-condensates , the decay scheme of the dilute @xmath2 state is conjectured to proceed mainly via @xmath0 decay .",
    "this indicates that such systems may be observed through the following sequential @xmath0 decays : [ dilute @xmath2 state ]  @xmath149  [ dilute @xmath150 state]+@xmath0 , [ dilute @xmath150 state ]  @xmath149  [ dilute @xmath151 state]+@xmath0 , @xmath152 .",
