    "a dolphin gliding through water with grace and speed presents both a beautiful performance of nature and a persistent enigma to fluid dynamicists .",
    "traditional models of fluid flow applied to a swimming dolphin suggest this mammal is capable of aberrantly large powers of muscular exertion .",
    "however , studies of dolphin energy expenditure show that a dolphin has a metabolism similar to that of other mammals @xcite , implying that these animals , rather then having unusual muscular capability , may posses some mechanism that allows them to slip through water with unusually little effort .",
    "sir john gray was the first to hypothesize that dolphins may posses an ability to impede the development of turbulence over the skin surface and hence reduce the surface drag of a swimming dolphin @xcite .",
    "a method of reducing boundary layer turbulence and surface drag would be extremely useful if it could be implemented efficiently , and the actualization of such a method has posed a theoretical and experimental challenge to researchers .",
    "some researchers have attempted to reproduce the dolphin s conjectured drag reduction by studying  and attempting to duplicate  the pliable nature of dolphin skin @xcite .",
    "it was thought that the surface drag induced by a turbulent boundary layer could be reduced if the surface was able to yield to the microscopic disturbances produced by turbulent eddies .",
    "unfortunately , this approach was not significantly successful .",
    "more recently , a large effort has been extended towards exploring the possibility that active control of surface shape in response to the forces from the turbulent boundary layer may be able to reduce turbulent development . the proposal that this sort of direct active response is implemented by dolphins",
    "is ostensibly supported by the existence of systems of nerves and cutaneous muscle that appear capable of actively controlling the skin surface .",
    "however , detailed measurement of dolphins skin reaction to microvibratory stimuli indicate a minimum response time on the order of @xmath1 @xcite , whereas the timescale associated with the passage of coherent structures over the skin is on the order of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this indicates that a dolphin s skin is not able to respond to the passage of individual coherent structures .",
    "it is only recently that shoemaker and ridgway documented a feature of odontocete skin that had been virtually unknown previous to their work ; namely , the existence of cutaneous ridges covering most of the body surface @xcite .",
    "these corrugations , with furrows running circumferentially around the whales , are reported to be @xmath3 in height when the animal is at rest , with a separation of @xmath4 , and vary slightly in scale over the dolphin s body .",
    "the ridges are absent from the dolphin s snout and from much of the head ",
    "regions associated with laminar flow , as well as from the flippers and tail , ( figure [ fig : ridges ] ) .",
    "the fact that the corrugations exist only in regions of steady turbulent flow is a strong indication that these ridges are associated with turbulent development .",
    "the absence of the corrugations from the flippers and tail indicates that the ridges may not be useful in these regions which are exposed to large velocity and pressure variations",
    ".    microscopic studies of sections of skin over the dolphin s body show the capillary and muscular structure to be correlated with cutaneous ridge spacing .",
    "this anatomical analysis is consistent with the possibility that a dolphin may actively tune the amplitude of surface corrugations to correspond with swimming velocity .",
    "although the measured surface ridge height is small for a dolphin at rest , producing a ridge height to length ratio of @xmath5 , a photo - micrograph of a section of dolphin skin , ( figure [ fig : skin ] ) , displays a much larger ratio , @xmath6 .",
    "this indicates that a live dolphin may be reducing the ridge height to the smaller value while at rest by using cutaneous muscle , while the `` relaxed '' ridge height ratio , indicative of the available range of ridge heights , is much larger .",
    "this hypothesis is further supported by reports from trainers at sea world that the surface ridges become more pronounced with greater swimming speed @xcite .",
    "the existence of regular corrugations with tunable amplitude covering the bodies of these efficient swimmers , in regions associated with steady turbulent boundary layer flow , presents a challenging new mystery .",
    "this challenge is met in this dissertation , which presents a theoretical model for and an analysis of the effect of such a wavy boundary on turbulent development .",
    "allthough cutaneous ridges were observed and measured by shoemaker and ridgway in seven species of toothed whales ( odontocetes ) , ranging in body length from two to eight meters @xcite , no correlation between body size and corrugation scale is visible in the data . it may be possible , through future study , to establish a correlation between corrugation scale and swimming speed . however , detailed information regarding the swimming speeds of these various species is not currently available .",
    "hence , a correlation between swimming speed and corrugation size is not presently possible to establish .",
    "the best observational data currently exists for the bottlenosed dolphin ( _ tursiops truncatus _ ) , and this species is taken as representative for this analysis .",
    "adult _ tursiops _ vary in size from two to four meters , mass approximately @xmath7 , and have been observed to be capable of bursts of swimming speed up to @xmath8 , though constant cruising speed is reported to be roughly @xmath9 @xcite .    since the boundary layer thickness at the location where the transition to turbulence occurs is small , approximately @xmath10 at cruising speed ,",
    "the circumferential curvature of the dolphin s body is not significant .",
    "thus , a laterally flat dolphin may be assumed for the purpose of studying boundary layer turbulence .",
    "the transition to turbulence occurs for flow over a flat plate at a calculated position of @xmath11 from the edge of the plate . however , transition to turbulence in flow over a dolphin is significantly delayed by the pressure gradient induced by the longitudinal curvature of the dolphin s head , and is observed via bioluminescent excitation to begin approximately @xmath12 from the snout @xcite .    allthough transition to turbulence in flow over a dolphin s curved head",
    "is delayed by the favorable pressure gradient , once initiated , turbulent development and evolution is assumed to be of the same character as turbulent development over a flat plate with no pressure gradient .",
    "a consideration of the effect of surface corrugations on turbulent flow development starts with understanding the evolution of the boundary layer over a flat surface .",
    "the flow of water , with density @xmath13 and viscosity @xmath14 , is described by the navier - stokes equation , @xmath15 in which @xmath16 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath17 is the advective derivative , and the fluid velocity field , @xmath18 , is restricted to be incompressible , @xmath19 incompressibility may be assumed , provided fluid velocities remain much less than the speed of sound in the fluid .",
    "all velocities are described with respect to the rest frame of the boundary surface .",
    "therefore , the skin of a dolphin swimming at speed @xmath20 through stationary fluid is modeled as a stationary flat plate immersed in fluid with background ( free stream ) velocity of @xmath21 in the @xmath22 ( streamwise ) direction .",
    "the plate is oriented such that @xmath23 is normal to the plate surface , which lies in the plane @xmath24 , with the leading edge of the plate located at @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath26 coordinate runs along the span of the plate , with arbitrary origin .",
    "viscosity plays the primary role in boundary layer evolution as the irrotational fluid first encounters the leading edge of the flat plate .",
    "the fluid at the plate surface is attached to the surface via molecular interactions and must satisfy the `` no slip '' boundary condition , @xmath27 the equations of motion , ( [ navierstokes ] ) , for the flow may be solved numerically or approximately to obtain the laminar boundary layer profile , @xmath28 , ( figure [ fig : blas ] ) .",
    "the profile may be characterized by several descriptors of boundary layer thickness .",
    "the @xmath29 thickness , @xmath30 , is the most common descriptor , and is defined arbitrarily as the height at which @xmath31 .",
    "another less arbitrary descriptor , the displacement thickness , @xmath32 , is defined to be equal to the distance the wall would have to be displaced into the fluid such that the mass flux of fluid over the boundary would be the same as that for fluid flowing over the wall `` free slip '' with the free stream velocity @xmath20 , @xmath33 and may be considered the middle of the boundary layer .    the boundary layer fluid induces a shear stress of @xmath34 on the wall in the @xmath22 direction .",
    "this stress produces the drag force per unit area on a body traveling through the fluid .",
    "the shear stress at the surface provides a natural scale for velocities and distances near the wall for both laminar and turbulent flow .",
    "the friction velocity is defined as @xmath35 and the length scale , one `` wall unit , '' is defined as @xmath36    the boundary layer thickness grows as the fluid progresses over the body . for flow over a flat plate , the laminar boundary layer displacement thickness grows as @xmath37 the corresponding boundary layer reynolds number , @xmath38 , increases with the boundary layer thickness until it reaches a critical value of @xmath39 , at which point the laminar flow becomes unstable .",
    "this occurs at the corresponding critical boundary layer thickness of @xmath40 and , for a flat plate , at the position @xmath41 when the boundary layer becomes unstable to the growth of ts waves .",
    "the reynolds number describing the transition point is also often give as @xmath42 , corresponding to the distance from the plate edge at which transition occurs .    because the shear stress , @xmath43 , decreases as the boundary layer thickness , @xmath30 , grows",
    ", the wall units of the laminar boundary layer do not grow as quickly in @xmath44 as the boundary layer thickness .",
    "the wall units for the laminar profile grow as @xmath45 at the transition point these wall units are @xmath46 .      the linear stability analysis of laminar boundary layer flow over a flat plate was first calculated by tollmien in 1929 , schlichting in 1933 , and confirmed experimentally by schubauer and skramstadt in 1947 .",
    "the stability analysis proceeds by considering an infinitesimal , @xmath26 independent perturbation , @xmath47 , to the laminar velocity field , @xmath48 , of the form @xmath49 and solving the resulting eigenvalue problem for the wavenumber , @xmath50 , frequency , @xmath51 , and perturbing profile , @xmath52 . for a laminar velocity profile , @xmath48 , determined from a solution of the navier - stokes equations , the imaginary component of @xmath51 first becomes positive when the boundary layer has grown to the thickness @xmath53 , implying the onset of instability .",
    "the frequency and wavelength of the unstable ts waves at this onset of instability are found to be @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the ts waves grow very rapidly beyond the transition point , and the boundary layer takes on a qualitatively different form .",
    "the new flow , now with large scale periodic variations in @xmath44 , becomes unstable to a three - dimensional instability with periodic variations in @xmath26 .",
    "the three - dimensional instability , best understood through a study of vorticity dynamics , evolves directly to turbulent flow .",
    "the evolution of the boundary layer may be more deeply understood via a description of the dynamics of vorticity .",
    "the vorticity field of the fluid is defined as the curl of the velocity , @xmath56 taking the curl of the navier - stokes equation , ( [ navierstokes ] ) , and using a vector identity produces the vorticity equation for the incompressible fluid , @xmath57 the laminar fluid flow over the flat plate is described simply as the creation of concentrated vorticity at the leading edge and its diffusion , advection , and stretching downstream .",
    "the advected vorticity initially coats the flat plate with a smooth layer of vorticity .",
    "the entire laminar boundary layer may be considered a vortex sheet of constant strength , with sheet thickness increasing with @xmath44 . from this point of view , the ts instability of the boundary layer is seen as similar to the kelvin - helmholtz instability of a shear layer .    with the onset of the ts instability , the smooth vorticity of the sheet condenses into areas of higher vorticity separated periodically in @xmath44 .",
    "these concentrations of vorticity then continue via nonlinear evolution to wrap and condense into spanwise oriented vortex filaments , evolution similar to the nonlinear development of a shear layer @xcite .",
    "this process of nonlinear development into vortex filaments is highly influenced by small irregularities in the initial fluid velocity field which produce significant variations from perfectly uniform vortex filaments .",
    "although the shape and distribution may deviate significantly from the ideal , these filaments and their evolution represent the dominant structure of the boundary layer after the transition point , and play the central role in further boundary layer development .",
    "the initial vortex filaments , evolving from the vortex sheet after the ts instability , are separated by the distance @xmath58 in @xmath44 , and are located at the initial height @xmath59 above the surface .",
    "a calculation of the three dimensional instability will show that this height must be equal to @xmath60 .",
    "since @xmath61 , the effect of initial neighboring filaments on evolution is small and may be ignored @xcite .",
    "a straight vortex filament in the presence of a boundary is unstable due to the velocity field induced by its interaction with the surface .",
    "the filament velocity field is calculated by considering it to arise from an image vortex beneath the flat surface .",
    "a plot of the image induced velocity field surrounding the filament , relative to the motion of the filament , ( figure [ fig : velocity ] ) , shows the nature and direction of the stretching flow .",
    "the filament is linearly unstable to deformations in this stretching plane , oriented at an angle of approximately @xmath62 to the boundary surface .",
    "this three dimensional vortex filament instability is treated in detail in chapter [ sec : flatboundary ] , and the effects of a wavy boundary are considered in chapter [ sec : wavy ] .",
    "the filament over a flat boundary is found to be maximally unstable to deformations of wavelength @xmath63 , and is sketched in figure [ fig : filament ] .",
    "a numerical investigation confirms that a filament with a small initial perturbation rapidly deforms into a sinusoid of wavelength @xmath64 inclined at an angle of approximately @xmath65 .",
    "the expanding sinusoidal filament then leaves the realm of linear evolution as the bottom of the filament nears the surface and adheres to it , forming streamwise oriented vortex `` legs , '' while the top of the filament continues to rise with linear rather then exponential growth as it advects downstream . in this manner a `` horseshoe '' or `` hairpin '' vortex is formed .",
    "although the existence of hairpin vortices was postulated by theodorsen in 1952 @xcite , and has been examined in great detail in experiments by head and bandyopadhyay @xcite and others @xcite , the vortex filament instability mechanism , the crow instability @xcite , leading to the formation of these hairpin vortices , has only now been established @xcite .",
    "the linear crow instability of a vortex filament pair was initially calculated , and confirmed numerically @xcite , for the case of two aircraft trailing vortices .",
    "the same analysis applies for the near wall filament , and is described in chapter [ sec : flatboundary ] , with the second of the vortex pair replaced by the image filament .",
    "recent experimental investigations indicate that autogeneration occurs in the further evolution of these vortex filaments @xcite . in this process , the legs of the hairpin vortex pinch together and",
    "form another filament , which then grows via the same instability , to align itself slightly behind the original .",
    "this process repeats and produces a long chain of hairpin vortices in line behind each original hairpin .",
    "these trains of tightly packed hairpin vortices , `` hairpin packets , '' are the dominant structures in the turbulent boundary layer .",
    "the fully turbulent boundary layer over a flat plate is a tumultuous collection of hairpin vortex packets and filament remnants .",
    "since boundary layer evolution is highly nonlinear and sensitively dependent on initial conditions , any simple model , such as the one described with the idealized vortex filament picture , can only represent the dominant processes of the dynamics and can not capture the fine structure of small scale motions .",
    "rather , a statistical analysis of fluid flow is employed to understand the processes of energy transport and induced surface drag .",
    "the effects of coherent structures , such as collections of hairpin vortices , may then be considered on the basis of how they effect the mean properties of the flow .",
    "the mean velocity field in the turbulent boundary layer is found by taking the infinite time average of the velocity field @xmath66 the reynolds decomposition is performed by decomposing the variables into the time average quantity and the remaining fluctuating quantity , @xmath67 , @xmath68 this decomposition allows the steady , time independent , mean flow to be considered separately from the more complex underlying turbulent flow .",
    "the mean equations of motion are obtained by taking the time average of the incompressibility condition , ( [ incompress ] ) , and navier - stokes equation , ( [ navierstokes ] ) , to get , in component notation , @xmath69 the last term , @xmath70 , the reynolds stress term , represents the effect of the turbulent eddies on the mean flow .",
    "the mean flow of the boundary layer develops a profile similar to the laminar flow profile .",
    "a standard model of the mean velocity profile for turbulent boundary layer flow has emerged from many decades of experimental research .",
    "the profile , @xmath71 , as a function of @xmath72 , breaks into several regions .",
    "the `` inner region '' extends to approximately @xmath73 , and is fitted by the curve @xmath74 , with @xmath75 equal to the non - dimensionalized distance from the surface in wall units as defined by ( [ wu ] ) .",
    "the `` log layer '' begins at approximately @xmath76 , and is fitted by the curve @xmath77 .",
    "these curves are matched to each other in the `` buffer layer '' between @xmath78 and @xmath76 .",
    "the log layer extends out into the `` outer region , '' where it asymptotically approaches the free stream flow , @xmath20 , ( figure [ fig : tprof ] ) .",
    "the mean boundary layer thickness grows linearly with @xmath44 as @xmath79 , faster then the square root dependence of the laminar boundary layer .    unlike the laminar flow case ,",
    "in which the primary energy loss is due to viscosity , the mean flow of the turbulent boundary layer is influenced more strongly by the energy loss to the underlying turbulent flow due to the reynolds stress . in regions far from the boundary the effects of viscosity on the mean equations of motion are negligible , and the viscosity term may be ignored .",
    "the mean energy transport equation is obtained by multiplying ( [ meanmom ] ) by @xmath80 to get @xmath81 in which the mean strain rate is @xmath82 .",
    "this equation is best understood by considering it a description of the mean energy balance of an infinitesimal fluid element .",
    "the change in kinetic energy of the element , @xmath83 , is equal to the energy transported across its boundary ( the divergence term ) , plus the loss to viscosity , @xmath84 , plus the loss to turbulence , @xmath85 .",
    "the most significant mean strain in the boundary layer is @xmath86 .",
    "hence , the dominant energy transport from mean to turbulent motion is due to the term @xmath87 , and large energy losses to turbulence are associated with @xmath88 events in a region of large mean shear .",
    "this may be understood physically as the creation of turbulent flow by the lifting of low speed fluid near the boundary layer up and against the higher speed fluid in the upper boundary layer , a `` low speed streak '' and `` turbulent burst , '' and by the converse , a `` sweep , '' in which high speed fluid descends into the lower boundary layer @xcite .",
    "this intermittent turbulent bursting and sweeping phenomenon is experimentally observed in the turbulent boundary layer , and measured to account for the majority , @xmath89 @xcite@xcite , of the turbulent energy transfer .",
    "these phenomenon are consistent with the hairpin vortex model of turbulent structures , and the large energy transfer may be considered as flowing from the mean shear into the stretching of the inclined hairpin vortex filaments in the boundary layer .",
    "the energy imparted to the turbulent development of the fluid , that is , the growth of hairpin packets , must ultimately arise from the surface via surface drag .",
    "the mean surface stress is @xmath90 . the mean velocity profile , @xmath91 , of turbulent boundary layer flow is strongly affected by the reynolds stress .",
    "the addition of the reynolds stress term with @xmath88 in the mean momentum equation , ( [ meanmom ] ) , generates a much steeper profile than for laminar flow , @xmath92 , and hence much greater surface drag .",
    "it is important to note that the naturally occurring hairpin vortices over a flat surface , inclined at an approximately @xmath62 angle , produce the largest contribution to the reynolds stress .",
    "the legs of such a vortex , oriented in the @xmath93 direction , have large corresponding fluid velocities in the @xmath94 direction , producing @xmath88 .",
    "a plot of @xmath95 along a line threading an example vortex , ( figure [ fig : filuv ] ) , shows this explicitly .",
    "the legs of a hairpin vortex , inclined at an an angle @xmath96 , will produce a reynolds stress , @xmath97 proportional to @xmath98 .",
    "the velocity field around an advecting hairpin vortex , or vortex packet , directly explains the observation of streaks , bursts , and sweeps .",
    "the streak and burst events are described by the upwards and backwards flow beneath the vortex filament heads , while the sweep events are associated with the passing of the vortex legs near the boundary .",
    "furthermore , the well documented spanwise spacing of the streaks , @xmath99 @xcite , is directly explained as the wavelength of the maximally unstable mode of the vortex filament instability that arises from a filament born at @xmath60 , the top of the high shear inner region of the boundary layer profile .    a coherent model of turbulent motions over a flat surface is formed by the consideration of the birth and development of hairpin vortices . the spanwise vortices condense during the ts instability , and rapidly develop into hairpins , via the three dimensional instability , to constitute a turbulent boundary layer .",
    "further spanwise vortices condense in the high shear region , @xmath60 , via autogeneration , and evolve , once again via the three dimensional instability , to form hairpin packets and fill the evolving boundary layer .",
    "the dominant structures in the turbulent boundary layer , the hairpin vortices and hairpin packets , develop via the three dimensional instability of concentrated patches of spanwise oriented vorticity .",
    "the vortex filament model of the developing turbulent boundary layer provides an elegant framework in which to calculate the specifics of this instability .",
    "the mean ambient vorticity at the high shear , inner region of the turbulent boundary layer , @xmath100 accumulates into the thin , spanwise filaments centered at the filament height , @xmath59 , above the wall .",
    "the vorticity of each filament is considered to condense from a square patch of side @xmath59 centered around the filament center , producing a vortex with circulation @xmath101 which propagates in the surrounding , locally constant , mean background flow , @xmath102 , in the @xmath22 direction .    in the region of the turbulent boundary layer dominated by vortical structures , above several wall units ,",
    "the effects of viscosity are small compared to the dynamical interaction of the vortices with the wall and with themselves .",
    "the simplifying assumption is thus made that the filament propagates in an inviscid background , @xmath103 , with the no slip condition at the wall relaxed to the free slip condition , @xmath104 , or , more generally , @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the normal at the boundary , @xmath107 .",
    "consider a single , nearly straight , infinite vortex filament , parallel to the @xmath108-axis , located in space above the flat surface at the position @xmath109 this time , @xmath110 , and spanwise coordinate , @xmath26 , dependent description of the filament position is adequate for the linear stability analysis in which the filament is not allowed to loop back on itself in the @xmath26 direction .",
    "ideally , the filament is represented as an infinitely concentrated region of vorticity , @xmath111 the actual vorticity distribution is not singular , but is characterized by a finite vortex core size .",
    "this must be considered in calculating the self - interaction of the filament . however , the above approximation is valid in the case of small vortex core sizes , and the results of the stability calculation will display only a weak dependence on core size .",
    "the motion of the filament is obtained by using ( [ vortdist ] ) in the vorticity equation , ( [ vorticity ] ) , and dropping the viscous term to get @xmath112 in which the velocity field , @xmath113 , which includes the background flow and the filament induced flow compatible with the vorticity distribution , is being evaluated at the vortex filament position , @xmath114 . inserting ( [ r ] ) into ( [ rmo ] ) gives the equations of motion for the @xmath115 and @xmath116 coordinates of the filament , @xmath117 the flow induced by the vortex filament , @xmath118 , must be calculated at each moment from the geometry of the filament and boundary .",
    "the filament compatible velocity field , @xmath119 , must satisfy @xmath120 , with @xmath121 given by ( [ vortdist ] ) , as well as satisfying the free - slip boundary conditions , ( [ freeslip ] ) .",
    "since the fluid is considered incompressible , the velocity may be written as the curl of a stream function , @xmath122 , with the stream function , @xmath123 , consisting of terms for the filament induced flow and the background flow , and background streamfunction @xmath124 for the current case .",
    "this gives , via a vector identity , the relationship between the vorticity and stream function , @xmath125 the gauge choice @xmath126 may be made without affecting the flow , @xmath119 .",
    "finding the stream function , and hence the induced velocity , is then reduced to the problem of solving the vector poisson s equation , @xmath127 , with the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "this solution may be written as @xmath128 by using the ( dyadic ) green function satisfying @xmath129 and the boundary condition @xmath130 equivalent to @xmath131 .",
    "green s function satisfying ( [ poiss ] ) and ( [ bcg ] ) for a flat boundary at @xmath24 is @xmath132 \\\\   &   & -\\frac{1}{4\\pi \\sqrt{\\left ( x - x'\\right ) ^{2}+\\left ( y+y'\\right ) ^{2}+\\left ( z - z'\\right ) ^{2}}}\\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } 1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & -1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{array}\\right ]   \\end{array}\\ ] ] the construction of this green function may be understood via the method of images . for each vortical element that acts as a vector potential source through the first term in ( [ gflat ] )",
    ", there is a mirror image source beneath the surface that acts through the second term in ( [ gflat ] ) .",
    "the minus sign in @xmath133 arises because the mirrored element points in the opposite direction in @xmath23 .",
    "the image ensures that the boundary conditions , ( [ bcg ] ) , are satisfied , since it cancels out the components of @xmath134 parallel to the surface .    the velocity field induced by the vortex filament and its image , as well as the background flow ,",
    "is found by taking the curl of the stream function to get @xmath135 which is recognizeable as the bio - savart law for the vorticity / current source , with the image vortex position defined as @xmath136 .",
    "the above equations simplify dramatically for the case of a straight filament . in this case , the filament position is independent of @xmath26 , and can be written as @xmath137 the equations of motion , ( [ eomf ] ) , become simply @xmath138 and the induced velocity may be found by integrating ( [ biosavaart ] ) or solving poisson s equation in two dimensions , and differentiating , to get @xmath139 evaluating this induced velocity at the filament in the equations of motion gives @xmath140 which implies that a straight filament travels over the flat surface at a constant height , with a constant velocity of @xmath141 in the @xmath22 direction .",
    "it is interesting and very useful that the dynamics of the vortex filament motion , ( [ eomf ] ) , have a hamiltonian formulation @xcite . taking the dynamical variables to be @xmath115 and",
    "@xmath116 and the canonical , instantaneous , fundamental poisson bracket to be @xmath142 the equations of motion are obtained as @xmath143 in which the hamiltonian is the kinetic energy of the filament induced flow as a functional of @xmath144 and @xmath145 , @xmath146 note the common abuse of notation by which a variational derivative such as @xmath147 is defined implicitly such that @xmath148    the existence of hamiltonian dynamics for the motion of the filament will facilitate the linear stability analysis as well as aid in the calculation of the equations of motion in new variables via canonical transformations .",
    "the equations for the three dimensional motion of the filament , ( [ rmo ] ) , are presently ill defined because the induced velocity , ( [ biosavaart ] ) , diverges at the filament .",
    "this is remedied by using a filament with a finite core size .",
    "rather then make a smoothing correction to the vorticity distribution , ( [ vortdist ] ) , with the associated complication of dealing with core dynamics @xcite@xcite , a cutoff is imposed on the self - induction term for the stream function @xcite @xmath149 } dz'\\ , g_{ij}(\\overrightarrow{x},\\overrightarrow{r}(z'))\\frac{dr_{j}}{dz'}\\ ] ] where the @xmath150   $ ] stands for the region @xmath151 and @xmath152 , @xmath153 is the vortex core radius , and @xmath154 is a numerical factor . the approximate value of @xmath154 is determined by establishing consistency with the known self induced velocity of a solid cored vortex ring , and is found to be @xmath155 .    for small core sizes",

    "it is used in ( [ ham ] ) to form the new , non - singular hamiltonian .",
    "the radius of the vortex cores , @xmath153 , for the initial spanwise filaments must be established by direct experimental observation .",
    "an inspection of slides of turbulent boundary layer flow indicates core sizes on the order of @xmath157 @xcite . for a filament located at an initial height of @xmath60",
    "this corresponds to a relative core radius of @xmath158 although this quantity is only roughly estimated , the filament instability of interest , the instability induced by the filament interaction with the wall , is only weakly dependent on core size .",
    "the equations of motion may be linearized for small perturbations from the straight filament solution .",
    "an analysis of the filament behavior for small perturbations will display the nature of the three dimensional instability , including its angle and growth as a function of spanwise wavelength .",
    "this linear analysis will later be confirmed and extended by a fully nonlinear numerical simulation in section [ sec : numsim ] .",
    "the equations of motion , ( [ eomf ] ) , are linearized around the two dimensional filament motion to get , @xmath159 where @xmath160 is a bookkeeping variable used to keep track of the order in the small perturbative variables , @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",

    "although the method of images is not accurate for a wavy surface , it is a good approximation when the filament height is small compared to the period , @xmath334 , and provides an alternative view of the effects of the wavy surface on the filament instability . as the filament center travels over the surface , following a streamline , ( figure [ fig : fil2d ] ) , it travels periodically closer to and farther from the boundary , with its image filament drawing correspondingly nearer and farther . this rapid , time periodic , change in the most fundamental parameter , the vortex filament height from the surface ,",

    "by altering the dynamics of vortex filaments , dolphin skin reduces the rate of energy transport to turbulence in the evolving turbulent boundary layer .",
    "this results in a net reduction of the drag induced by skin friction .",
    "the effectiveness of this drag reduction technique is limited by the countering influence of increased skin friction due to the form drag of the surface ridges . above a critical ridge height , @xmath402 , the turbulent flow over the ridges separates , forming large eddies behind each ridge , and generates a large drag increase .",
    "the drag reduction at a given velocity will be optimal at ridge heights just below this critical value .",
    "the pondermotive forcing induced by the wavy boundary causes the vortex filaments over the ridges to stretch at a maximally unstable angle , @xmath204 , that is significantly less then the maximally unstable angle for filaments over a flat boundary .",
    "this dynamical effect acts over a range of velocities centered about an optimum velocity determined by the wavelength of the surface corrugations . for a dolphin with surface ridges of wavelength @xmath233 ,",
    "the optimal swimming speed for this dynamic effect is @xmath391 .",
    "although most effective at this velocity , surface ridges of this wavelength produce a significant reduction in the maximally unstable angle for a range of velocities between @xmath403 , ( figures [ fig : stab.2]-[fig : staba.025 ] ) .",
    "this result is in excellent agreement with the reported swimming speed for this species of dolphin .",
    "the boundary layer vortex filaments developing over such ridges grow into hairpin vortices inclined at the reduced angle .",
    "packets of these hairpin vortices , now inclined at an angle lower than the @xmath65 characteristic of hairpins over a flat surface , produce a significantly lower reynolds stress within the turbulent boundary layer .",
    "the reynolds stress contribution from hairpin vortices inclined at an angle @xmath204 , ( [ rstress ] ) , is proportional to @xmath404 .",
    "any deviation in hairpin inclination away from @xmath62 produces a reduction of reynolds stress , with a corresponding reduction in the rate of turbulent energy transport .",
    "since the dominant contribution to turbulent energy transport comes from the hairpin vortices , and the rate of energy transport is directly proportional to the drag force on the surface , the percentage drag reduction due to the altered filament dynamics , @xmath405 , can be roughly equated with the percentage reduction in reynolds stress , @xmath406 the drag reduction obtained using surface ridges is directly proportional to the degree to which the maximally unstable angle of the vortex filament may be lowered .",
    "this angle depends upon the swimming velocity and corrugation wavelength , as well as on the ridge height , @xmath309 . however , for ridge heights that are very large , the turbulent flow over the ridges will separate , and form large stationary eddies behind each ridge that effectively lower the ridge height and significantly increase drag .",
    "the drag reduction is limited by the maximal ridge height allowed before turbulent flow separation is induced . a linear model of turbulent boundary layer flow over a sinusoidal surface gives an estimate for the critical ridge height , @xmath402 , at which separation occurs .",
    "this estimate is calculated , and confirmed by direct measurement , in papers by zilker and hanratty @xcite,@xcite . for low friction velocities , @xmath407 , and",
    "hence for low background velocities , the critical ridge height is calculated to be @xmath408 .",
    "however , the critical ridge height increases with velocity , because of the tendency of turbulent flow to inhibit separation .",
    "for example , at @xmath409 , the critical ridge height becomes @xmath410 . also , because the shape of cutaneous ridges over dolphin skin are not exactly sinusoidal , but have slightly steeper peaks and wider troughs , the critical ridge height for separation to occur over these ridges may vary from the value for perfectly sinusoidal ridges .",
    "it is likely that the shape and distribution of the dolphins cutaneous ridges is adapted to maximize the ridge height , and the dynamical effect on the vortex filaments , without inducing flow separation . given the structure of cutaneous muscle beneath the ridges , it is also very likely that the dolphins adjust the height of their cutaneous ridges to match the swimming velocity  keeping the ridge height slightly below the critical value in order to maximize drag reduction .",
    "the percent drag reduction due to the reduced inclination angle of the vortex instability for a variety of surface ridge heights is plotted in figure [ fig : drag ] .",
    "the drag reduction at the optimum swimming velocity of @xmath411 varies from @xmath412 for very small ridges of height @xmath413 to @xmath0 for ridges of height @xmath375 .",
    "since it is likely that a dolphin increases the ridge height with swimming velocity , the percent drag reduction achieved is likely to increase with swimming velocity as a dolphin adjusts the ridge height to adapt to the higher critical ridge height .",
    "man has long looked to the animal world for inspiration in efficient engineering design .",
    "the discovery and analysis of cutaneous ridges in odontocetes presents another engineering feat of mother nature that may be emulated and put to human use .",
    "the drag reduction obtained through the use of surface corrugations will only be significant if properly matched to the selected application .",
    "the ridge spacing , @xmath227 , must be tuned for a specific velocity range , and the ridge height must not be so great as to induce separated flow between the ridges .",
    "although a dolphin may vary the ridge height to accommodate greater speeds , it is unlikely that an artificial implementation of variable ridge height would be cost effective to manufacture and employ .",
    "therefore , cutaneous ridges may find practical application only when surfaces are expected to move through a fluid at a steady velocity .",
    "the optimal ridge spacing for fluid flowing over a flat plate is calculated to be @xmath414 .",
    "this spacing depends only on the near boundary structure of the turbulent boundary layer , particularly the length of one wall unit , @xmath415 .",
    "the length of a wall unit over a smooth boundary may be determined experimentally by measuring the mean surface stress , @xmath43 , by observing the spanwise wavelength of the coherent structures present , @xmath416 , or , alternatively , by approximating a wall unit as @xmath417 .",
    "for example , an aircraft which regularly travels at a speed of @xmath418 may wish to employ surface corrugations of wavelength @xmath419    the ridge height should be set just below the critical value , to avoid separation .",
    "a ridge height ratio of @xmath420 will always be below the critical value , and produce a surface drag reduction of @xmath412 .",
    "however , the critical value of the ridge height should be determined experimentally , so that the maximal ridge height may be employed and the greatest drag reduction achieved .",
    "it is possible that ridge heights of ratio greater than @xmath421 may be allowed , producing an @xmath0 or higher reduction in surface drag .",
    "although several researchers have investigated the development of a turbulent boundary layer over a wavy wall , through experiment and numerical simulation @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , none have focused on the parameter range relevant to the flow of water over dolphin skin , or given attention to the development and evolution of coherent structures .",
    "however , it should be straightforward to extend these investigations to the relevant parameter range and thus determine the validity of the theoretical predictions .",
    "the optimal ridge height for drag reduction , the critical height at which separation occurs , should be determined experimentally .",
    "it would also be very usefull to determine if a swimming dolphin does increase the cutaneous ridge height with swimming velocity , and to what degree ; although it is not clear how such an experiment would be carried out .",
    "the dolphins have had sixty million years to optimize the reduction of drag through the control of vortex filament dynamics , and there is still a great deal to learn from these fascinating creatures .",
