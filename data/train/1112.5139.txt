    "there are twenty six molibdenum isotopes on the segr chart , studied by means of @xmath6-ray spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "they span a wide region , where a variety of shapes are observed , from the spherical @xmath7mo to one of the most deformed nuclei in the @xmath8 mass region .",
    "of particular interest are the @xmath9mo nuclei , which are placed in a region where an offset of the quadrupole deformation takes place @xcite .",
    "also , the two nuclei are placed in the third oscillator shell in protons and at the beginning of the fourth oscillator shell in neutrons , where high-@xmath10 and low-@xmath10 single particle orbits with @xmath11 enhance the effects of octupole collectivity @xcite .",
    "being on the edge between the single - particle and collective modes , the two nuclei represent an excellent laboratory , where different approaches can be tested . in this respect , of particular interest",
    "are the nuclear lifetimes of excited states which are directly related to transition matrix elements and hence are sensitive to the underlying structure .",
    "fast - timing measurements were performed in @xmath9mo .",
    "the nuclei were produced in fusion - evaporation reactions , performed at the nipne tandem accelerator .",
    "a beam of @xmath12o was accelerated up to 62 mev and focused on a @xmath13se target with a thickness of 5 mg/@xmath14 on a 2 mg/@xmath14 thick au backing .",
    "the cross section for the @xmath13se(@xmath12o , 5n@xmath6)@xmath2mo channel was estimated as 400 mb , while that for the @xmath13se(@xmath12o , 4n@xmath6)@xmath5mo channel as about 100 mb .",
    "the beam intensity was of the order of 20 pna .",
    "[ 0.31]mo.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the gamma - ray detector system consisted of eight labr@xmath15:ce detectors and eight hpge detectors , working in coincidence@xcite .",
    "the labr@xmath16:ce detectors issue positive dynode and negative anode signals .",
    "the dynode signals were used for energy measurements while the anode signals were used for timing .",
    "the time signals were shaped by constant fraction discriminators ( cfds ) and sent to time - to - amplitude - converters ( tacs ) operating in a common stop mode .",
    "the energy and time signals were digitized and the data were stored in event files , collected for approximately two hours each .",
    "the system was triggered by coincidences between two labr@xmath16:ce and one hpge detector .",
    "the data were analyzed with gaspware and radware @xcite packages .",
    "three dimensional matrices were sorted with labr@xmath15:ce energy on two of the axes and a relative time , defined as @xmath17 , on the third axis .",
    "here , @xmath18 is the moment of interaction of the preceding in the time @xmath6-ray and @xmath19 is the moment at which the delayed @xmath6-ray was detected .",
    "@xmath20 is an arbitrary offset .",
    "if the two @xmath6-rays feed and de - excite a particular nuclear level and @xmath21 denotes the energy of the feeding transition , while @xmath22 is the energy of the delayed transition , then for each event two matrix elements @xmath23 and @xmath24 were incremented .",
    "then , from the time projected @xmath25 and @xmath26 two - dimensional gates , two time spectra , symmetric with respect to the arbitrary offset @xmath20 , were obtained .",
    "if the lifetime of the level of interest is of the order of the detectors time resolution , the centroids @xmath27 of the time distributions will be displaced by 2@xmath28 one from the other , where @xmath28 is the lifetime of the level .",
    "this procedure is known as the centroid shift method @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the two centroids will overlap in the cases where @xmath21 and @xmath22 feed and de - excite nuclear level with a lifetime shorter than the binning of the converter , which was of 6 ps / channel . for lifetimes longer than the detector time resolution",
    "the slope method was used to determine level lifetimes . to reduce the background in the labr@xmath16:ce spectra",

    "gamma - ray intensities for the strongest yrast transitions were deduced from a spectrum gated by the 949-kev transition and normalized to the 594-kev transition . in the cases where a particular level decays by more transitions , spectra gated on the feeding transition were used to normalize the intensity of the weaker transition to the intensity of the strongest transition .",
    "energy and intensity balance was performed .    the lowest lying levels in @xmath2mo ( fig .",

    "the centroids of the symetric time distributions constructed for the @xmath37 state ( fig . [ time95]a ) overlap within the time binning , which is consistent with the half - life of 2.58(11 ) ps quoted in nndc @xcite .",

    "the @xmath45 state decays via two branches with energies of 38 kev and 386 kev .",
    "the 38-kev transition is highly converted , and its energy is outside of the detectors range of sensitivity .",
    "hence , the transition was not observed experimentally in the present experiment .",

    "a half - life of 0.11(5 ) ns was obtained using the centroid shift method . the transition strength for the 809-kev transition results as @xmath520.6(3 ) w.u .",
    "the ground state of @xmath2mo is a @xmath53 state , which is consistent with the ordering of the neutron single - particle levels in the @xmath54 mass region @xcite where @xmath55 single - particle orbit appears at the beginning of the fourth oscillator shell .",
    "next to the @xmath55 single - particle orbit is @xmath56 .",
    "indeed , the @xmath57 level , placed at 767 kev in @xmath2mo , decays via a @xmath58 transition to the ground state with @xmath59 w.u @xcite .",
    "the next yrast @xmath60 level in @xmath2mo has an energy of 948 kev , which is close to the @xmath61 level energy of the neighboring even - even nuclei .",
    "also , the @xmath62 state decays via a strong @xmath63 transition with @xmath64 w.u @xcite .",
    "such a state can be interpreted as a @xmath55 single particle state fully aligned with the first @xmath61 phonon of an even - even core @xcite . in this respect",
    "it is interesting to compare the matrix elements , obtained for the @xmath63 transitions in the even - even @xmath5mo , with the @xmath63 matrix elements , obtained from the yrast transitions in the even - odd @xmath2mo nucleus .",
    "the matrix elements , calculated from @xmath65@xmath66 for the yrast transitions in @xmath9mo , are shown on fig .",

    "the experimental matrix elements are also compared to the harmonic vibrator matrix elements , which were parameterized from the first excited state in @xmath5mo .",
    "the @xmath67 matrix element , calculated for @xmath5mo @xcite , remarkably coincides with the harmonic vibrator @xmath67 matrix element .",
    "also , the @xmath68 matrix element , calculated from the @xmath2mo data , is consistent with its interpretation as a fully aligned particle - core coupled state .",
    "further , with the increase of the angular momentum , the experimental matrix elements deviate from the harmonic vibrator description .",
    "in fact , the experimental matrix elements are even smaller than the @xmath69 matrix element . in this spin range ,",
    "the odd- and even- mass molibdenum matrix elements are again in the same range . in order to account for",
