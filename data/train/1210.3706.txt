    "for the best case of bi@xmath0femoo@xmath1 , the half - metallic gap and curie temperature reach to 0.71 ev and 650 k , respectively .",

    "scalar approximation is used for relativistic effect@xcite , and the spin - orbit coupling is neglected because it has little effect on our main conclusion ( to be detailed in the following ) .",
    "we use monkhorst - pack method to generates the k - point mesh@xcite , choosing 6@xmath26@xmath26 ( 6@xmath26@xmath24 ) for structure optimizations and total energy calculations of 10-atom ( 20-atom ) unit cells and 12@xmath212@xmath212 for electronic structure calculations .",

    "there are some induced spin density in the spheres of the bi and o atoms , less than @xmath6 .",
    "because they are very small compared to those in the spheres of the magnetic atoms , we shall consider only the magnetic atoms in the following .",
    "actually , a and b atoms form a lattice of magnetic unit cells ( cubic unit cells of a nacl crystal structure ) @xcite . in these calculations",

    "should be decreased to an small value , 0.1 or smaller . through comparing the total energies",

    "it is well known that curie temperature will be a little underestimated if classical approximation to the heisenberg model ( 2 ) is used in the monte carlo simulation , but it must be much overestimated if the model ( 2 ) is reduced to ising model . for comparison , we do our monte carlo simulations with both of the approximate models .",

    "in contrast , the ising model results are 1010 , 396 , 264 , and 270 k for ab = femo , mnmo , mnos , and cros , respectively .",
    "therefore , the curie temperatures for the four half - metallic ferrimagnets are , at least , 650 , 255 , 174 , and 201 k for bi@xmath0femoo@xmath1 , bi@xmath0mnmoo@xmath1 , bi@xmath0mnoso@xmath1 , and bi@xmath0croso@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "high curie temperature well above room temperature could be realized in bi@xmath0femoo@xmath1 .",
    "our calculated results shows that the spin exchange interaction between the nearest a and b atoms is positive , and the a - a and b - b interactions are either weak or negative depending on specific a and b atoms@xcite . in the case of bi@xmath0femoo@xmath1 ,",
    "our calculations show that the nearest a - b spin exchange energy is 39.2 mev , and the nearest a - a and b - b spin exchange energies are 0.13 and -0.71 mev , respectively .",
    "the main spin interaction is intermediated by the o atom in between the magnetic a and b atoms , with the a - o - b bond angle being almost 180@xmath16 , and therefore , it is an antiferromagnetic superexchange .",
    "the a atom contributes a different magnetic moment from the b atom so that ferrimagnetism is formed in these double perovskite compounds .",
    "possible overlapping of the nearest o wave functions should play some roles in these compounds , but the main mechanism for the ferrimagnetism must be the antiferromagnetic superexchange between the nearest a and b atoms .    in summary ,",
    "our first - principles calculations show that four double perovskite oxides , bi@xmath0abo@xmath1 ( ab = femo , mnmo , mnos , and cros ) , have negative formation energy , from -0.42 to -0.26 ev per formula unit . in the case of bi@xmath0femoo@xmath1",
    ", our calculated results uncover that its half - metallic gap and curie temperature reach to 0.71 ev and 650 k , respectively .",
