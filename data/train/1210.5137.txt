    "because of the rich physical properties in fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) , it has proved to be a vital and exciting subfield of condensed - matter physics to the present day .",
    "the electronic state giving rise to the experimentally @xcite observed fqhe features should be of a many - particle origin , and has been studied intensively with various theoretical  tools @xcite .",
    "at present , most of experiments on this issue are performed in high - mobility gaas - based semiconductor structures .",
    "however , it is a still a challenge to detect the fractional quantum hall state with high filling factors @xcite ( such as @xmath0=@xmath6 ) due to the restrict of carrier mobility and the weak electron interactions in two dimensional semiconductor materials .    fortunately , recently discovered two - dimensional electron systems , including graphene @xcite , two - dimensional hgte quantum wells @xcite , and surface state of three - dimensional topological insulators ( ti ) @xcite , which possess linear dispersion relation near the dirac points with high fermi velocity , may be good platforms to detect the fqhe . the unusual integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe )",
    "@xcite with the @xmath7 separation in the quantized hall conductivity has been found experimentally in graphene , where the landau levels ( lls ) are four - fold degenerate without zeeman effect and weak spin - orbit couplings . soon after this discovery , nomura and macdonald @xcite suggested the interaction - driven quantum hall effects with intermediate integer value of @xmath8 because of the charge gaps due to the electron - electron interaction .",
    "fqhe in graphene was also predicted theoretically @xcite , and the @xmath1`-`fqhe state was later measured @xcite successfully in suspended graphene .    because of the dirac nature of the electrons , many properties of the two - dimensional and three - dimensional tis are similar to those of graphene .",
    "recently , the graphene - like iqhe has been observed in strained bulk hgte @xcite  and the ll spectrum has been measured in bi@xmath9se@xmath10 by using scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite .",
    "features in the hall resistance at fractional filling factors have been speculated to be related to the fqhe of tis @xcite .",
    "however , the finite thickness of ti sample in the growth direction will affect the nature of the fqhe states on ti surfaces @xcite , which is in contrast to the case in graphene .",
    "in addition , there exists an another remarkable difference between graphene and ti , among which topologically protected dirac cones on the surface of three - dimensional ti arise from the real spin - orbit coupling while the dirac cone in graphene results from the pseudospin - orbit coupling . as a consequence ,",
    "the external magnetic field induced zeeman effect in ti and graphene are quite different .",
    "the zeeman effect reforms the lls as @xmath11 in ti ( @xmath12 is the zeeman energy , @xmath2 is the ll index and @xmath13=@xmath14 is the cyclotron frequency ) , while in graphene the lls split as @xmath15 in the presence of zeeman effect . thereby , the influence of zeeman effect on fqhe in ti should be quite different from that in graphene .",
    "furthermore , on one side , the zeeman term can perturb the landau quantization in ti materials for a sufficiently large g - factor , which can reach @xmath1630 in recent experiment performed on the surface of bi@xmath9se@xmath10 @xcite , in contrast , the g - factor in graphene is very small . on the other side , sufficiently strong magnetic field as large as hundreds of tesla , which can also bring on prominent zeeman effect , is achievable in current experimental capabilities .",
    "therefore , because of its importance both from basic point of interest and to the analysis of unconventional properties of ti - based fqhe , in the present paper we address the role of zeeman effect in fqhe of the massless dirac electrons on ti surface by presenting an attempt at the theoretical evaluation of the effective pseudopotentials of the electron - electron interactions and the ground ( excitation ) state nature at @xmath1-fqhe between the @xmath2=@xmath3 lls problems .",
    "we find the following facts : ( i ) the effective pseudopotentials of the coulomb interaction @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the relative angular momentum of two electrons ) are reformed due to the zeeman term . at the first few relative angular momentum @xmath18 , we have @xmath19 for any ll @xmath20 , while by increasing @xmath18 to a moderate value , an inverse of the effective pseudopotentials happens @xmath21 .",
    "( ii ) by taking into account the zeeman effect and exactly diagonalizing the many - body hamiltonian in the sphere geometry , the ground state energies and the excitation gaps at @xmath0=@xmath1 fqhe between the @xmath2=@xmath3 lls exhibit asymmetry .",
    "( iii ) comparing with that at the @xmath2=@xmath5 ll , the fqhe state at the @xmath2=@xmath4 ll is more robust because the excitation gap at @xmath2=@xmath4 ll is larger than that in @xmath2=@xmath5 ll in the presence of the zeeman energy .",
    "these findings obtained can not be observed in graphene within zeeman effect , because the zeeman energies in graphene just translate the lls by @xmath22 , but induce no influence on the the haldane s pseudopotential of electron - electron interactions .",
    "we start from the free electron low - energy effective hamiltonian of ti surface in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field , which is given by@xmath23 where @xmath24 is the fermi velocity and @xmath25=@xmath26 is the two - dimensional canonical momentum .",

    "one can easily find from eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) that the effective pseudopotential at the @xmath2=@xmath42 ll is independent on the zeeman energy .",
    "the effective pseudopotentials at other lls ( @xmath20 ) , however , are dependent on the zeeman energy . because the stability of fqhe phenomenon can only occur at @xmath2=@xmath67 lls on a ti surface @xcite , we only plot in fig .",

    "we notice that on one side , the pseudopotentials @xmath70 and @xmath71 are degenerate in the absence of zeeman term ( @xmath65=@xmath42 ) , which could also be straightforwardly observed from eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) by setting @xmath45=@xmath42 . on the other side ,",
    "the degeneracy between @xmath70 and @xmath71 is removed with increasing the zeeman parameter @xmath65 .",
    "interestingly , one can see in fig .",

    "we also find in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that , for the electrons at ll @xmath2=@xmath3 the pseudopotentials @xmath70@xmath76@xmath71 only for relative angular momentum @xmath18=@xmath42 and @xmath4 , but @xmath77 for higher angular momentum @xmath18 .",
    "these results could also be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , where the red squares ( blue triangles ) correspond to @xmath2=@xmath4 ( @xmath2=@xmath5 ) with @xmath65=@xmath72 .",

[ fig2](b ) .     between two electrons at ( a ) @xmath2=@xmath3 and ( b ) @xmath2=@xmath79 lls as functions of the relative angular momentum @xmath18 with different zeeman parameters @xmath65=@xmath42 and @xmath65=@xmath72 .",
    "the lines are a guide to the eye . ]    based on the pseudopotentials for dirac fermions on the surface of tis , one can further obtain the energy spectra of the many - body states at fractional fillings of the ll by numerically diagonalizing the many - body hamiltonian in the spherical geometry @xcite . in this point of view , thus the external magnetic field perpendicular to the surface of sample is equivalent to a fictitious radial magnetic field produced by a magnetic monopole at the center of sphere of radius @xmath80 , which is related to the magnetic fluxes @xmath81 through the sphere .",
    "it is easy to demonstrate that in the units of flux quanta @xmath80=@xmath82 , and the many - body states could be described by the total angular momentum @xmath83 and its @xmath33 component @xmath84 , while the energy just depends on @xmath83 . in what follows",
    ", we investigate the system with the fractional filling factor @xmath0=@xmath85 , where @xmath86 is an integer , especially the @xmath86=@xmath4 case , i.e. , the @xmath0=@xmath1 fqhe state which is realized at @xmath87=@xmath88 in the spherical geometry , where @xmath89 is the electron number",
    ".    the typical results of exactly diagonalized energy spectra per electron for the @xmath0=@xmath1`-`fqhe state at @xmath2=@xmath3 lls with the same zeeman parameter @xmath65=@xmath72 as well as the degenerate energy spectra for the @xmath0=@xmath1-fqhe state at @xmath2=@xmath3 without zeeman term are shown in fig .",
    "one can clearly observe in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that the degenerate energy spectra ( black ) at @xmath65=@xmath42 split into two - class alike energy spectra when the zeeman term are introduced . the excited energy spectra ( red ) at @xmath2=@xmath4 ll are promoted while those ( blue ) at @xmath2=@xmath5 ll are degraded . from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] one can also find two prominent features brought by the zeeman term as follows : ( i ) the fqhe state at the @xmath2=@xmath4 ll is more robust since the excitation gap at @xmath2=@xmath4 ll is larger than that at @xmath2=@xmath5 ll in the presence of the zeeman term ; ( ii ) however , the promotion ( degradation ) of each excited energy is not same with each other , which indicates that the zeeman term leads to the asymmetry of the lls .",
    "these two properties of the zeeman effect on the fqhe in tis are unique , which can not be observed in the popular studied graphene system because the zeeman energy in graphene hamiltonian @xmath90 does not affect the haldane s pseudopotential but just translate the lls by @xmath91 .     for @xmath89=@xmath92 electrons at @xmath0=@xmath1 fqhe state .",

    "we now turn to study the dependence of the excited gap on the zeeman parameter @xmath65 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the excited energy gap ( in unit of @xmath62 ) versus zeeman parameter @xmath65 for @xmath89=@xmath92 electrons at @xmath1`-`fqhe state , whose corresponding lowest excited state angular momentum is @xmath83=@xmath93 .",
    "one can clearly see that the excited gap for @xmath2=@xmath4 ll is always larger than that for @xmath2=`-`@xmath4 ll , which is consistent with the results in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . besides , the excited gap for @xmath2=`-`@xmath4 ll monotonically decreases with increasing the zeeman parameter ( see the blue line in fig . [ fig4 ] ) . whereas , the variance of the excited gap for @xmath2=@xmath4 ll ( the red line in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) is weak with increasing the zeeman parameter , and it gradually increases to a maximum at @xmath94 and then tends to decrease .",
    "the above discussions focus on the system of @xmath89=@xmath92 electrons , but the properties obtained herein are conserved when the electron number @xmath89 is changed . the results of the excited gap as a function of @xmath89 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . we should point out that , firstly , for the @xmath2=@xmath42 ll , the zeeman term does not affect the fqhe in tis and therefore the excited gaps are same for different values of @xmath65 .",
    "secondly , the case of @xmath2=@xmath42 ll is quite different from that for @xmath20 lls . from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we see that the excited gap is promoted ( degraded ) for @xmath2=@xmath4 ( @xmath2=@xmath5 ) ll due to the zeeman effect .",
    "thirdly , the angular momentum @xmath83 of lowest excited state alters with the electron number @xmath89 , which is indicated by the integers in fig .",
    "for instance , the angular momentum of the lowest excited states for systems of @xmath89=@xmath93 and @xmath95 electrons are @xmath83=@xmath75 , while this becomes @xmath83=@xmath93 for systems of @xmath89=@xmath92 and @xmath96 electrons .",
    "we also studied the fqhe with the fractional filling factor @xmath0=@xmath97 , where @xmath86=@xmath98 , @xmath75,@xmath99 , and obtain the same results as that with @xmath0=@xmath1 .     for the @xmath2=@xmath3 lls with different zeeman parameters @xmath100=@xmath72 and @xmath65=@xmath42 .",
