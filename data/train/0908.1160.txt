    "this paper is concerned with a design of a rather new type of effective interatomic interaction for molecular dynamics and similar applications .",
    "a large body of empirical data is concerned with so called bonded force fields , i.e. models where the structures in question are unbreakable but deformable , with torsion angles in addition to the stretching and compression of the bonds .",
    "the model proposed here is of the non - bonded type of interactions , also called reactive force fields , which allow formation of new geometries and establishing new and breaking existing bonds . during the last about 25 years",
    "several empirical methods were introduced to represent basic interactions between atoms , starting with the three - body interactions of stillinger and weber @xcite , several versions of the tersoff - brenner potentials @xcite , @xcite , the so called environment - dependent interaction potentials ( edip ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the most elaborate reaxff @xcite .",
    "these model interactions can be used in molecular dynamics without performing any quantum mechanical calculations , they are empirical representations in some cases built on the quantum chemical studies , sometimes on models which are fitted to experimental facts .",
    "the term non - bonded models could also cover the so called _ ab initio _ methods based on quantum mechanical approach to electronic structure , but these are generally considered separately , because their requirments and applications differ from the much simpler to implement classical potentials .",
    "a large group of such non - bonded interactions have been extensively discussed in our paper @xcite , which in fact could serve as a first part of this study .",
    "this paper describes a proposal for a rather new approach to modeling the interactions between atoms which is not based on a single potential function but attempts to model explicitly the known geometrical features of bonds and orbitals . in simple terms",
    "it can be described as orbital based interatomic interaction , which means that the dependence of the energy surface on the geometry of atomic configurations is modeled with the help of predefined orbitals .",
    "we thus wish to call the proposed model obmd , orbital - based molecular dynamics .",
    "it will become clear that the model leads to only pair interactions .",
    "we refer also to a recent work of rechtsman , stillinger and torquato @xcite discussing what they called `` synthetic diamond and wurtzite structures '' which are self - assembled using only isotropic pair interactions as an example of special type of interactions .",
    "several of the existing potential models already contain features which are beyond simple potential functions , as e.g. the environmental dependent interaction potentials ( edip ) or the very detailed reactive force fields ( reaxff ) .",
    "this work has been inspired also by these approaches and if the presented framework would become accepted , many empirical data could be imported from these models .",
    "the re - orientation of the orbitals in the presented model in the md applications would lead to the necessity to introduce some model moments of inertia and then the presence of spurious kinetic energy associated with the rotation of the atoms with respect to their axes , which clearly does not have any physical meaning .",
    "thus one part of the model is also a prescription to avoid this problem by introducing an over - damped rotational orientation of the orbitals , much like in the langevin approach , but here the langevin equations are only applied to the spurious energy which is removed by spurious friction .    in the typical potential - based applications",
    "one is using a potential with predefined parameters to simulate a physical situation . from a possible",
    "disagreement the parameters of the potential can be modified , and the aim is to model the chemistry with the basis of the chosen potential functions .",
    "contrary to that , the proposed model aims to include as much as possible of the known chemistry by giving the atoms prototypes or blueprints of the bonds and the basic geometry as close as possible to the chemical bonds , in a way similar to the unbreakable bonds of molecular mechanics but with the built in reactivity feature , i.e. the atoms can break and form old and new bonds . at the same time",
    "the nature of the model is such that the atoms appear to interact only via two - body interactions with complex features .",
    "the described model is not yet implemented in a full width .",
    "the parameters needed can quite directly be derived from existing model potentials , but this should be followed by comparisons and readjustments to ab initio calculations .",
    "we start by a detailed discussion of a simple planar model in order to introduce the idea of the obmd in section [ two - dim - sect ] .",
    "the introduction and discussion of the overdamped angular motion is presented in section [ overdamped ] .",
    "modeling of the carbon sheets in three dimensions relevant for graphene and graphite is the subject of section [ 3dim_sheet ] .",
    "extensions needed for description of carbon structures , including the possible algorithms for implementation of the models of the structural changes are discussed in section [ environment ] .",
    "possible applications of the proposed approach to other elements and compounds are discussed in section [ other_compounds ] .",
    "the interaction is modelled by overlapping orbitals belonging to each atom ( or what we imagine as hybridized atomic orbitals ) .",
    "thus each atom looks more like a little molecule with one `` heavy '' atom - i.e. the actual nucleus , and the centers of the orbitals , which are located at the half length of the known bond , as a sort of additional quasiatoms .",
    "here we think about the graphene sheet modelled by these objects with three arms .     of eq .",
    "[ s_vertexangle].,width=340 ]    the orbitals have maximum overlap when their centers coincide - and when their axes are aligned , that is the same as when the nuclei are at the distance of the bond length and their `` orbital centers '' coincide .",
    "the necessary coordinates are ( in 2 dimensions ) @xmath1 the positions of the axes are rigid inside the atom , since we put in the model that the ideal bond length is the property of the two neighbours .",
    "the deviation of the actual structure from the ideal bond is realized by displacing the two centers and possibly the disalignment of the arms , the arms and vertices can only be rotated .    for characterization of n - atom system",
    "are thus needed n atomic coordinates supplemented by each atom s orientation angle ( in the plane model only ) @xmath2 where we could also use a more general vector notation @xmath3 for the position vectors .        on each atom",
    "the three `` arms '' and vertices are characterized by their positions ( vectors ) @xmath4 or @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the unit vectors of the three arms . for each pair of atoms ,",

    "that is , the nucleus - nucleus repulsion takes the form @xmath12 and the strongly coordinating nine - term potential is @xmath13 this all - vertex - vortex interaction is assumed only in this section , and it was the original idea of the model , which could be written as a potential .    in the present model described below , we postulate an additional saturation feature , i.e. only the pair of nearest vortices interacts , once the nearest neighbour is established , the remaining two on each atom are forgotten , they do not interact .",
    "it is a much more realistic model , only one electron from each atom is forming the covalent bond ( the fact that there are so called double bonds will be discussed below ) .    to assure that the two vertices form a bond of the required bond length ,",
    "the two arms must point against each other , other configurations must lead to higher energy .",
    "the simplest implementation ( and thus perhaps not sufficiently flexible for all future applications ) is a form of @xmath14 containing a sum of an only radial term and one product term @xmath15 where both the radial functions @xmath16 , @xmath17 and the angular function @xmath18 are strongly peaked at @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .    in the discussed simple planar model we find that the angular alignment can be maintained by the natural stretching resulting from the combination of the nuclear repulsion and the attraction @xmath16 of the vertices , i.e. in 2 dimensions it might be enough to consider only the first term of eq .",

    "the repulsive part and the attraction between the arms combine together to give a potential of the same type as all of the known interatomic potentials . for three and more atoms",

    "we leave open the question whether this additional function is always necessary , but clearly its presence will make the fitting of the present model generally possible to most of , if not all , the known interactions .",
    "it is instructive to consider the interaction energy as a function of distance between two nuclei with all the other parameters constant , when the `` arms '' are kept aligned .",
    "this radial form of the potential should have a typical intermolecular potential shape .     with parameters discussed in the text .",
    ", width=264 ]    this radial form is easily obtained , it is given by the sum of the expression for the repulsion potential and the attractive potential of the two aligned arms .",
    "if the distance between the nuclei is denoted @xmath27 and the length of each arm is @xmath28 , then the radial form of @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the repulsion term of eq .",

    "[ w_rho_theta_prod ] .",
    "it is quite interesting that by substituting two gaussian shapes for both @xmath31 and @xmath16 , we always obtain a reasonable shape for this fixed orientation interatomic potential of our model .",

    "these two parameters would be needed in the model to assure a reasonable behaviour of the simulations . a method which avoids this additional complexity is to assume that the angular motion is `` overdamped '' , anologous to the over - damped langevin motion .",
    "this means that @xmath37 where @xmath36 must be adjusted ( as a free parameter ) and instead of the second order equation the angles are updated according to @xmath38",
    "in this section we discuss the extension of the previous model to 3 dimensions .",
    "the model is extended by the rotation axis of each atom , perpendicular to the plane where @xmath39 is measured .",
    "the unit vector is given by the two customary angles @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the model thus consists of atoms which contain three arms as in previous section and in addition a specified direction vector @xmath42 which is perpendicular to the plane of the arms .",
    "the variables describing the atom are thus the arms as in previous section and the additional direction vector , specified by the two angles ( analogy to the euler angles ) .    for characterization of n - atom system",
    "are thus needed n atomic coordinates @xmath43 supplemented by each atom s three orientation angles @xmath40 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath45 as before specifies the rotation of the arms while the angles @xmath40 and @xmath44 specify the normal to the plane of the arms , as well as the rotational axis for the rotation by @xmath45 .",
    "note that we adopt a notation where @xmath47 the interaction between the arms is identical to the previous section , a new element added is the simulation of the @xmath48-bonding by pairwise alignment of the axes of the interacting atoms .",
    "the nature of the @xmath48-bonding does not require the saturation feature discussed above , rather the requirement that the two atoms engaging in this new interaction also already interact via one of the arms - pairs .",
    "there are now three angular variables instead of one and the equations for angular motion become more complex .",
    "the generalized gradient and torque will update the angles again through first order equations , since the model assumption of over - damped motion is also present here .",
    "formally , the interaction can now be written as follows . the atom - atom interaction analogous to eq .",

    "thus the representation of graphite situation can be based on split and re - shaped dipole - dipole type interaction where the transverse term aligns each sheet while the parallel term has such radial dependence with a minimum at the known distance between sheets of graphite .",
    "a group of carbon atoms will interact in many different ways , depending on their mutual relations . up to now",

    "when there are more than two close neighbours , it will become energetically advantageous to have more electron - orbital mixing than just one stark mixture , which can lead to the formation of additional sigma orbitals ( bonds ) with neighbour atoms .",

    "we shall now construct an effective interaction leading to the alignment of structures of the type ( a ) . comparing the two structures ,",
    "it is easy to see ( especially when using a three - dimensional molecular modeling set ) that the chains of figure [ diamond - vs - lonsdale ] are repeated in three planes which have in common the line connecting the two atoms , i.e. one pair of the `` arms '' . in the case ( a ) the three unconnected `` arms '' on each of the neighbor atoms point in exactly opposite directions , it means that in the case ( a ) all four pairs of the arm vectors directionally closest ( lying along the same line , but in opposite sense ) to each other are having scalar products equal to @xmath67 . in case",
    "( b ) , and in any other conformation of carbon or aliphatic hydrocarbons , this is never the case .",
    "the desired effective interaction can be described by a spin - spin type formula @xmath68 where @xmath69 are the unit vectors of the `` arms '' and the summation runs only over the four pairs of the total 16 which are directionally closest , i.e. give the smallest contributions .",
    "this formula will give zero for the diamond arrangement and a positive energy penalty for any other orientation of the two model atoms .",
    "when additional atoms are added to the ends of the discussed `` arms '' , this two - body interaction results in four - body correlations .",
    "an essential feature of the proposed model is the switching of a given atom s behaviour between the @xmath0 to @xmath70 or the @xmath65 regimes . in the edip model",
    "this is implemented by adding a more or less continuous function . here",
    "we propose a sort quantum jump switching behaviour .",
    "however , it does not mean that the structure will change by a jump .",
    "only the relation of the arms ( and in fact their number , only the @xmath60-orbitals are represented by arms ) if an atom can not find and get aligned with two perpendicular @xmath71-vectors , it will switch from the @xmath70-regime of figure [ sigma-sigma-pi-pi.png ] to the @xmath0 regime of figure [ 3-sigma-pi.png ] .",
    "the conditions for the switching and their implementation are the strength of the proposed model , but on the other hand they represent a problem since at present we do not yet have a realistic prescription .",
    "this must be obtained both from chemical observations and from quantum chemical calculations .",
    "when considering the @xmath65-regime , we should mention the representation of hydrogen atoms , which simply are one - armed atoms with a suitable arm length to complement the length of the carbon arm so that their sum becomes the length of the hydrogen to carbon bond .",
    "the situation for silicon which has four valence @xmath72 electrons is quite different from the carbon case of @xmath73 electrons .",
    "si - atoms would not experience the @xmath0-hybridization of atomic orbitals which is so important for carbon , i.e. clearly no @xmath48-bonding in addition to the @xmath65-hybridization of atomic orbitals . on the other hand , groups of si atoms",
    "can arrange themselves in many other geometries ( at higher temperatures ) .",
    "the proposed model could be used in place of the tersoff potential for situations where the diamond - like structure remains the most important feature . for description of these cases",
    "the present model concentrating mainly on the features seen for @xmath73 atomic states should be extended to model also further features of higher atomic states .",
    "oxygen and sulfur are another pair of similarly related elements with @xmath73 and @xmath72 orbitals , respectively .",
    "these elements show even more different behavior than carbon and silicon .",
    "in particular the complex behaviour of sulfur aggregates presents a problem not well studied in the framework of simple models .",
    "extensions of the present model to many such new situations do not seem to be hindered by anything else than suitable representations of further features , derived from known chemical observations .",
    "in particular , the known complexity of sulfur behaviour including the @xmath74 rings ( cf the work of stillinger and weber on liquid sulfur @xcite ) might be well modelled with the help of future extensions to the discussed model .",
    "we have formulated a procedure for a design of a model empirical atomic interaction which has the ability to incorporate many more features than the traditional two- or three - body potentials . these many feature",
    "are directly connected with observed facts , since the interactions are pair interactions only .",
    "this is made possible by basing the model on predefined orbitals , much like the molecular structure models invented by andre dreiding . a natural name for",
    "the model would thus be the dreiding interactions , but unfortunately the dreiding force field already exists and does not have any of the features discussed here .",
    "we have thus chosen the name obmd for the proposed approach .",
    "the model is not yet practically implemented , we hope that we shall attract experts on different aspects to contribute to the fitting and modeling of the details . in concluding ,",
    "we show how powerful the idea is by simply considering the possible shapes of the potentials . in the traditional potentials , there are usually present two different inverse powers with opposite sign ( lennard - jones type ) , or two exponentials of different exponent ( morse type , tersoff etc ) , in our approach we can combine even two gaussians to obtain a nice shape for the potential as shown in figure [ two - gauss - fig ] .",
    "this is naturally made possible by the fact that the two gaussians are not centered at the same point , but one at the atomic center and the other at the orbital center .",
    "we would like to thank dr norbert lmmen at university of bergen for very helpful and enlightening discussions of his work based on the reaxff system , which contributed in a very important way to the formulation of the section on carbon ."
