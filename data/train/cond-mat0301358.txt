    "magnetism and superconductivity are two forms of long - range order that may exist in a material at appropriate low temperatures .",
    "when both are present and the singlet state paring occures , they compete with one another , and many authors have wondered under what conditions they might coexist .",
    "the answer has been emerging in recent years , but the story began many years ago with theoretical works by ginzburg @xcite , abrikosov and gorkov @xcite , and experimental studies by matthias and co - workers that intensively examined the solid solutions la@xmath7re@xmath8 @xcite and reru@xmath9 ( re = magnetic rare earth ions ) . in la@xmath7re@xmath8 ,",
    "superconductivity was destroyed by relatively small amounts of paramagnetic ions ( @xmath10 at.% ) , well before the long - range magnetic order appeared .",
    "these experiments showed that superconductivity was suppressed by the so - called @xmath11-@xmath12 exchange interaction between conduction electrons and localized f - shell spins .",
    "after many years of extensive studies of alloys and disordered compounds with paramagnetic impurities it became clear that long - range magnetic order and singlet state superconductivity may coexist only in weak limit of the @xmath11-@xmath12 exchange interaction @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest ways to fulfil this requirement consists in the spatial separation of conduction and magnetic electrons .",
    "this idea was first realized along with the discovery of ternary compounds like rerh@xmath13b@xmath13 and the remo@xmath14s@xmath15 chevrel phases @xcite .",
    "most of these compounds become superconducting below a temperature @xmath0 despite the presence of a relatively large amount of the rare earth magnetic ions ( @xmath16 at.% for rerh@xmath13b@xmath13 ) . moreover , many of them show long - range magnetic order in the superconducting state . for ferromagnetic ( fm ) order , superconductivity can be preserved only in a very narrow temperature range , just below the curie temperature . however , when the magnetic order is antiferromagnetic ( afm ) , superconductivity remains below the neel temperature , @xmath17 , down to the lowest investigated temperatures . the main reason for the observed coexistence of superconductivity and long - range antiferromagnetism seems to be the particularly weak exchange interaction due to the partial separation of the conduction @xmath18 electrons in @xmath19-space from the localized @xmath20 electrons of the rare earth ions due to the cluster structure of these compounds .    in",
    "layered low-@xmath0 reni@xmath9b@xmath9c superconductors , the spatial separation between conduction electrons , mostly ni 3d , and magnetic electrons , re 4f , is no longer clear .",
    "however , the weakness of the exchange interaction and , therefore , the presence of coexistence may still be understood . in these compounds , where re = dy , ho , er , and tm , the hybridization of 4@xmath12 and conduction electrons is weak and a partial separation between those electrons appears in momentum space . for re = pr ,",
    "nd , pm , sm , eu , gd , and tb , the absence of superconductivity involves several reasons which are beyond the scope of this article and are reviewed elsewhere .    in the case of layered high-@xmath0 reba@xmath9cu@xmath3o@xmath21 ( re123 ) superconductors , the coexistence between long - range antiferromagnetism and superconductivity seems to be more puzzling . in these compounds",
    "the magnetic re ions are located between the double cuo@xmath9 planes that are responsible for superconductivity .",
    "here , as for the layered low-@xmath0 superconductors , the long - range afm order of the re ions is realized via the rkky and/or superexchange interactions @xcite .",
    "for the re123 materials , however , a modified exchange mechanism is necessary because the re magnetic moments and the conduction electrons interact very weakly .",
    "an additional reason that the coexistence of afm order and superconductivity occurs in high-@xmath0 superconductors may be the extremely short coherence length , @xmath22 , about 15  in the ab - plane .    for low-@xmath0 classic and layered magnetic superconductors ,",
    "the unusual behavior of the upper critical field near and below @xmath17 has been widely explored to verify pair - breaking interactions that arise when magnetic and superconducting subsystems coexist . for high-@xmath0 superconductors , the upper critical fields at temperatures where the magnetic order appears are generally unavailable in the laboratory . in this work",
    ", we discuss some low field effects that allow us to study the interaction between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in high-@xmath0 materials .",

    "the most striking feature of the @xmath23 curve is a drastic dip of @xmath24 observed at @xmath17 .",
    "this irregularity is a simple consequence of the pair - braking effect caused by fluctuations enhanced near a phase transition .",

    "this property requires the vortex line to have a special magnetic structure when the field in the vortex core is larger than the sf transition field , @xmath25 . when the density of vortices increases , the spin - flop phase enlarges and the individual vortex may have a magnetic structure as presented in fig .",
