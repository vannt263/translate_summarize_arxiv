    "in recent years , optomechanical cooling of a mechanical resonator close to its quantum mechanical ground state has been an interesting topic for a wide range of fields of physics such as ultrahigh precision measurements @xcite and the detection of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "it has also provided a good approach for fundamental studies of the transition between the quantum and the classical world @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon can be realized in the optomechanical systems consisting of an optical cavity with a movable end mirror or with a membrane in the middle @xcite .",
    "on the other hand an effective optomechanical coupling can be simulated by a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) trapped inside a high finesse optical cavity @xcite . in the dispersive regime where the laser pump is far detuned from the atomic resonance",
    "the excited electronic state of the atoms can be adiabatically eliminated and consequently the only degrees of freedom of atoms will be their mechanical motions @xcite . for low photon numbers or in the weakly interacting regime the dynamics can be restricted to the first motional mode which plays the role of the mechanical oscillator@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study a hybrid optomechanical system consisting of a bec trapped inside an optical cavity with a moving end mirror which is driven through its fixed mirror . it is shown that in the weak coupling regime and under the bogoliubov approximation the side mode of the bec is coupled to the optical field through a radiation pressure term just like what occurs for the vibrational mode of the mirror . besides , we assume that the bec has been isolated from its environment so that its effective temperature is several orders of magnitude smaller than the equilibrium temperature of the mirror .",
    "this system is equivalent to a bare optomechanical system with a moving end mirror whose two vibrational modes are coupled with the radiation pressure of the cavity .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that in such a system the cooling of the main mode depends on the frequency difference between the two modes .",
    "when this difference is equal or larger than the main mode frequency , the secondary mode does not disturb the cooling of the main mode . in the hybrid system considered here , the bogoliubov mode of the bec plays the role of the secondary vibrational mode in the bare optomechanical one .",
    "one of the advantages of the hybrid system with respect to the bare one is that the frequency of the secondary mode ( bogoliubov mode ) depends on the _ s_-wave scattering frequency @xmath0 of the nonlinear atom - atom interaction which is controllable through the transverse trapping frequency @xmath1 @xcite . in this way the frequency difference @xmath2 between the two modes",
    "can be controlled .",
    "furthermore , in the present setup we can introduce an interpretation for the cooling process of the bogoliubov mode through its correspondence with the mirror vibrational mode and the way it gets entangled with the optical field .    on the other hand the nonlinear coupling between the two modes and the optical field ( radiation pressure coupling ) results in the optical bistability of the system where there are two stable mean - field solutions corresponding to different photon numbers and oscillator displacements @xcite .",
    "for an optical cavity containing a bec with no moving mirror this phenomenon is observable even below the single photon level @xcite . here , we also investigate both the effects of _ s_-wave scattering interaction and the mirror - field coupling on the optical bistability of the system .",
    "recently the optical bistability behavior has been investigated for a system consisting of a bec trapped inside a fabry - perot cavity with fixed mirrors which is pumped both along the cavity axis and from the transverse side @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the optical bistability can be controlled by this transverse pumping field . for small values of transverse",
    "pumping , there exists a clear bistability for a particular range of the input pump along the cavity axis while increasing the transverse pumping field , the range of the bistability region is reduced . increasing the transverse pumping above a critical value causes the bistable behavior to be disappeared .",
    "it has been shown that this phenomenon can be exploited for realization an optical switch in which the transverse pump is used as a control parameter to enable or disable the switch .    in this work ,",
    "we introduce another possibility of an optical switch realization in an optomechanical cavity with no necessity of using a transverse pumping field .",
    "it is shown that the bistability of the system can be controlled by the _ s_-wave scattering frequency @xmath0 which itself is controllable by the transverse trapping frequency @xmath1 . here",
    ", the optical bistability of the system does not disappear but it is shifted toward the larger values of the parallel pumping field .    the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",

    "again when @xmath128 , there is a complete overlap between the mirror - field entanglement in the presence of bec ( red line ) and in the absence of bec ( green dashed line ) . besides , when @xmath112 gets near to the neighbourhood of @xmath129 where @xmath122 is minimized , the mirror - field entanglement disappears and instead , the atom - field entanglement appears ( blue line ) .    in figs.[fig :",
    "fig5](b ) and [ fig : fig6](b ) , where @xmath0 has been fixed at @xmath4 , the frequency difference between the two modes is reduced to @xmath130 and therefore @xmath118 . as is seen from fig.[fig : fig5 ] ( b ) the minimum of @xmath122 ( blue line ) gets near to that of @xmath131 ( red line ) and so the two modes can be excited and cooled simultaneously as @xmath132 .",
    "besides , the presence of bec has caused the incoherent number of mirror phonons ( red line ) to be a little different from that in the absence of bec ( green dashed line ) . similarly , the mirror - field entanglement in the presence of bec [ red line in fig.[fig : fig6 ] ( b ) ] has more deviation from that in the absence of bec ( green dashed line ) and has also been diminished compared to its correspondence in fig.[fig : fig6 ] ( a ) while the atom - field entanglement has a noticeable increase .    in figs.[fig :",
    "fig5](c ) and [ fig : fig6](c ) the frequency difference between the two modes has been reduced to @xmath133 by reducing @xmath0 to @xmath134 . in this way",
    "the resonance frequencies of the two modes gets nearer to each other and therefore the presence of bec affects the cooling and entanglement processes more strongly . in fig.[fig : fig5 ] ( c ) , @xmath131 in the presence of bec ( red line ) is completely different from that in the absence of bec ( green dashed line ) . here ,",
    "since the radiation pressure force is exciting the two modes with very close resonance frequencies simultaneously , neither of them could be cooled effectively .",
    "fig.[fig : fig6 ] ( c ) shows that the mirror - field entanglement in the presence of bec ( red line ) reduces and instead the atom - field entanglement ( blue line ) increases and gets near to the red line . therefore , for small values of @xmath0",
    "the frequency difference @xmath2 reduces and the two bipartite entanglements get nearer to each other .",
    "this is similar to the result obtained in ref.@xcite where the mirror - field entanglement can be measured from the the atom - field entanglement .",
    "besides , in the range of parameters considered here the mirror - atom entanglement is zero .     for three different values of the atom - atom interaction strength : @xmath80 ( red thin line ) , @xmath87 ( blue dashed line ) and @xmath83 ( black dashed - dotted line ) .",
    "the green thick line corresponds to the absence of bec.,width=259 ]    the important result obtained from figs.[fig : fig5 ] and [ fig : fig6 ] is the derivation of an interpretation for the concept of cooling of the bogoliubov mode : the bogoliubov mode is cooled when the effective incoherent number of atoms @xmath122 is minimized ( just like what happens for the mirror when @xmath131 is minimized ) . in fact when @xmath112 gets near to the resonance frequency of the bogoliubov mode , @xmath122 is minimized and simultaneously the atom - field entanglement is maximized .",
    "therefore , the bogoliubov mode behaves just like a secondary mechanical mode with the difference that the atoms play the role of phonons .    in order to see the effect of the _ s_-wave scattering interaction on the cooling of the mirror more precisely , in fig.[fig : fig7 ]",
    "we have plotted the incoherent number of mirror phonons versus @xmath108 for three different _ s_-wave scattering frequencies : @xmath80 ( red thin line ) , @xmath87 ( blue dashed line ) , and @xmath83 ( black dashed - dotted line ) .",
    "the green thick line represents the mirror phonon number in the absence of bec . as is seen from fig.[fig : fig7 ] the presence of bec does not help the cooling process of the mirror very much and even increases the mirror phonons when @xmath0 is very small .",
    "the best situation occurs for @xmath83 where the minimum of @xmath131 in the presence and in the absence of bec gets near to each other .",
    "in this case for @xmath135 the cooling process is better than that in the absence of bec .",
    "similar results have very recently been obtained using the bose - hubbard model for simulating the bec by expanding the atomic wave field in terms of the wannier functions @xcite .",
    "based on the results obtained in fig.[fig : fig6 ] and our previous explanations , the _ s_-wave scattering interaction can be used as a control parameter to change the frequency difference @xmath2 between the two modes . the larger @xmath2 the less the effect of bec on the cooling of the mirror and the mirror - field entanglement . as is seen from fig.[fig : fig6 ] the mirror - field entanglement is increased by increasing the _",
    "s_-wave scattering frequency . for @xmath120",
    "it overlaps with the mirror - field entanglement in the absence of bec .",
    "inversely , the atom - field entanglement decreases by increasing the _",
    "s_-wave scattering interaction and its maximum is shifted toward the larger values of @xmath112 .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied a system consisting of a one - dimensional bose - einstein condensate inside a driven optomechanical cavity with a moving end mirror . in the weakly interacting regime , where just the first two symmetric momentum side modes with momenta @xmath25 are excited by fluctuations resulting from the atom - light interaction , the bec can be considered as a one mode oscillator in the bogoliubov approximation . in this way",
    "the bogoliubov mode of the bec is coupled to the optical field through a radiation pressure term which behaves as a secondary mechanical mode relative to the vibrational mode of the mirror ( main mode ) .",
    "we have investigated the effect of _ s_-wave scattering atom - atom interaction as well as the optomechanical coupling of the mirror on the optical bistablity of the cavity and on the cooling and entanglement processes of the two so - called mechanical modes .",
    "firstly , we have shown that increasing _",
    "s_-wave scattering interaction leads to a shift of the bistability region to the higher values along the parallel pump axis while the optomechanical coupling parameter of the mirror behaves inversely . in this way",
    ", one can control the bistability of the system by the _ s_-wave scattering frequency @xmath0 which itself is controllable by the transverse trapping frequency @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , it can be considered as another possibility of an optical switch realization in an optomechanical cavity .",
    "secondly , we have studied the effect of the presence of bec and the _ s_-wave scattering interaction on the cooling of the mirror and the bipartite mirror - field and atom - field entanglements .",
    "it has been shown that if the frequency difference between the two mechanical modes @xmath2 is larger than the band width of the cavity @xmath12 , then the two modes can be cooled down to their ground states at two distinct ranges of effective detuning @xmath112 and the presence of bec does not affect the cooling of the mirror .",
    "based on our results , when @xmath112 gets near to the frequency of the bogoliubov mode the effective incoherent numbers of atoms @xmath122 is minimized and the atom - field entanglement is maximized .",
    "so , minimizing the effective incoherent numbers of atoms can be interpreted as the cooling of the bogoliubov mode . on the other hand when @xmath118 neither the main mode ( mirror ) nor the secondary mode ( bogoliubov mode ) is cooled effectively",
    "this setup has the advantage of controlling @xmath2 through @xmath0 which is controllable by the transverse trapping frequency @xmath1 .",
