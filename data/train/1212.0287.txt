    "two - hop ad hoc wireless networks , where each packet travels at most two hops ( source - relay - destination ) to reach its destination , have been a class of basic and important networking scenarios @xcite .",
    "actually , the analysis of basic two - hop relay networks serves as the foundation for performance study of general multi - hop networks . due to the promising applications of ad hoc wireless networks in many important scenarios ( like battlefield networks , vehicle networks , disaster recovery networks ) ,",
    "the consideration of secrecy ( and also reliability ) in such networks is of great importance for ensuring the high confidentiality requirements of these applications .",
    "traditionally , the information security is provided by adopting the cryptography approach , where a plain message is encrypted through a cryptographic algorithm that is hard to break ( decrypt ) in practice by any adversary without the key .",
    "while the cryptography is acceptable for general applications with standard security requirement , it may not be sufficient for applications with a requirement of strong form of security ( like military networks and emergency networks ) .",
    "this is because that the cryptographic approach can hardly achieve everlasting secrecy , since the adversary can record the transmitted messages and try any way to break them @xcite .",
    "that is why there is an increasing interest in applying signaling scheme in physical layer to provide a strong form of security , where a degraded signal at an eavesdropper is always ensured such that the original data can be hardly recovered regardless of how the signal is processed at the eavesdropper .",
    "we consider applying physical layer method to achieve secure and reliable information transmission in the two - hop wireless networks .    by now , a lot of research works have been dedicated to the study of physical layer security based on cooperative relays and artificial noise , and these works can be roughly classified into two categories depending on whether the information of eavesdroppers channels and locations is known or not ( see section v for related works ) . for the case",
    "that the information of eavesdroppers channels and locations is available , a lot of transmission schemes have been proposed to achieve the maximum secrecy rates while optimizing the artificial noise generation and power control to reduce the total transmission power consumption [ 3 - 19 ] . in practice , however , it is difficult to gain the information of eavesdropper channels and locations , since the eavesdroppers always try to hide their identity information as much as possible . to alleviate such a requirement on eavesdroppers information , some recent works explored the implementation of secure and reliable information transmission in wireless networks without the information of both eavesdropper channels and locations [ 20 - 28 ] .",
    "it is notable , however , that these works mainly focus on exploring the scaling law results in terms of the number of eavesdroppers one network can tolerate as the number of system nodes there tends to infinity .",
    "although the scaling law results are helpful for us to understand the general asymptotic network behavior , they tell us a little about the actual and exact number of eavesdroppers one network can tolerate . in practice , however , such exact results are of great interest for network designers .",
    "this paper focuses on applying the relay cooperation to achieve secure and reliable information transmission in a more practical finite two - hop wireless network without the knowledge of both eavesdropper channels and locations .",
    "the main contributions of this paper as follows .    * for achieving secure and reliable information transmission in a more practical two - hop wireless network with finite number of system nodes and equal path - loss between all pairs of nodes",
    ", we consider the application of the cooperative protocol proposed in @xcite with an optimal and complex relay selection process but less load balance capacity , and also propose to use a new cooperative protocol with a simple and random relay selection process but good load balance capacity .",
    "* rather than exploring the asymptotic behavior and scaling law results , we provide theoretic analysis for above two cooperative protocols to determine the corresponding exact results on the number of eavesdroppers one network can tolerate to meet a specified requirement in terms of the maximum secrecy outage probability and the maximum transmission outage probability allowed .",
    "* we further extend our study to the more general and practical scenario where the path - loss between each pair of nodes also depends on their relative locations , for which we propose a new transmission protocol with both preferable relay selection and good load balance and also present the corresponding theoretical analysis under this new protocol .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents system models and also introduces transmission outage and secrecy outage for the analysis of transmission protocols .",
    "section iii considers two transmission protocols for the scenario of equal path - loss between all pairs of nodes and provides the corresponding theoretical analysis .",
    "section iv further presents a new transmission protocol and its theoretical analysis to address distance - dependent path - loss issue .",
    "section v introduces the related works and section vi concludes this paper .",
    "as illustrated in fig.1 that we consider a network scenario where a source node @xmath0 wishes to communicate securely with its destination node @xmath1 with the help of multiple relay nodes @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "in addition to these normal system nodes , there are also @xmath6 eavesdroppers @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath4 , @xmath9 that are independent and also uniformly distributed in the network .",
    "our goal here is to ensure the secure and reliable information transmission from source @xmath0 to destination @xmath1 under the condition that no real time information is available about both eavesdropper channels and locations .     wishes to communicate securely with destination @xmath1 with the assistance of finite relays @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath10 ( @xmath11=4 in the figure ) in the presence of passive eavesdroppers @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath4 , @xmath12 ( @xmath6=4 in the figure ) .",
    "cooperative relay scheme is used in the two - hop transmission .",
    "a assistant node is selected randomly as relay ( @xmath2 in the figure).,title=\"fig:\",width=192 ] .",
    "consider the transmission from a transmitter @xmath13 to a receiver @xmath14 , and denote by @xmath15 the @xmath16 symbol transmitted by @xmath13 and denote by @xmath17 the @xmath16 signal received by @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that all nodes transmit with the same power @xmath18 , path - loss between all pairs of nodes is independent , and the frequency - nonselective multi - path fading from @xmath13 to @xmath14 is a complex zero - mean gaussian random variable . under the condition that all nodes in a group of nodes , @xmath19 , are generating noises , the @xmath16 signal received at node @xmath14 from node @xmath13 is determined as :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the path - loss exponent .",
    "the noise @xmath22 at receiver @xmath14 is assumed to be i.i.d complex gaussian random variables with @xmath23 } = n_0 $ ] , and @xmath24 is exponentially distributed with mean @xmath25}$ ] . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath25}=1 $ ] .",
    "the sinr @xmath26 from @xmath13 to @xmath14 is then given by    @xmath27    for a legitimate node and an eavesdropper , we use two separate sinr thresholds @xmath28 and @xmath29 to define the minimum sinr required to recover the transmitted messages for legitimate node and eavesdropper , respectively .",
    "therefore , a system node ( relay or destination ) is able to decode a packet if and only if its sinr is greater than @xmath28 , while the transmitted message is secure if and only if the sinr at each eavesdropper is less than @xmath29 .      for a transmission from the source @xmath0 to destination @xmath1 , we call transmission outage happens if @xmath1 can not decode the transmitted packet , i.e. , @xmath1 received the packet with sinr less than the predefined threshold @xmath28 .",
    "the transmission outage probability , denoted as @xmath30 , is then defined as the probability that transmission outage from @xmath0 to @xmath1 happens .",
    "for a predefined upper bound @xmath31 on @xmath30 , we call the communication between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is reliable if @xmath32 . notice that for the transmissions from @xmath0 to the selected relay @xmath33 and from @xmath33 to @xmath1 , the corresponding transmission outage can be defined in the similar way as that of from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "we use @xmath34 and @xmath35 to denote the events that transmission outage from source @xmath0 to @xmath33 happens and transmission outage from relay @xmath33 to @xmath1 happens , respectively . due to the link independence assumption ,",
    "we have    @xmath36    regarding the secrecy outage , we call secrecy outage happens for a transmission from @xmath0 to @xmath1 if at least one eavesdropper can recover the transmitted packets during the process of this two - hop transmission , i.e. , at least one eavesdropper received the packet with sinr larger than the predefined threshold @xmath29 .",
    "the secrecy outage probability , denoted as @xmath37 , is then defined as the probability that secrecy outage happens during the transmission from @xmath0 to @xmath1 . for a predefined upper bound @xmath38 on @xmath37 , we call the communication between @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "is secure if @xmath39 .",
    "notice that for the transmissions from @xmath0 to the selected relay @xmath33 and from @xmath33 to @xmath1 , the corresponding secrecy outage can be defined in the similar way as that of from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "we use @xmath40 and @xmath41 to denote the events that secrecy outage from source @xmath0 to @xmath33 happens and secrecy outage from relay @xmath33 to @xmath1 happens , respectively .",
    "again , due to the link independence assumption , we have    @xmath42",
    "in this section , we consider the case where the path - loss is equal between all pairs of nodes in the system ( i.e. , we set @xmath43 for all @xmath44 ) .",
    "we first introduce two transmission protocols considered for such scenario , and then provide theoretical analysis to determine the numbers of eavesdroppers one network can tolerate under these protocols .",
    "the first protocol we consider ( hereafter called protocol 1 ) is the one proposed in @xcite , in which the optimal relay node with the best link condition to both source and destination is always selected for information relaying . notice that although the protocol 1 can guarantee the optimal relay node selection , it suffers from several problems .",
    "protocol 1 involves a complicated process of optimal relay selection , which is not very suitable for the distributed wireless networks , in particular when the number of possible relay nodes is huge .",
    "more importantly , since the channel state is relatively constant during a fixed time period , some relay nodes with good link conditions are always preferred for information relaying , resulting in a severe load balance problem and a quick node energy depletion in energy - limited wireless environment .",
    "based on above observations , we propose to use a simple and random relay selection rather than the optimal relay selection in protocol 1 to achieve a better load and energy consumption balance among possible relay nodes . by modifying the protocol 1 , the new transmission protocol ( hereafter called protocol 2 ) works as follows .    *",
    "1 ) _ relay selection _ : * a relay node , indexed by @xmath45 , is randomly selected from all candidate relay nodes @xmath46 .    * 2 ) _ channel measurement _ :",
    "* the selected relay @xmath33 broadcasts a pilot signal to allow each of other relays to measure the channel from @xmath33 to itself .",
    "each of the other relays @xmath47 then knows the corresponding value of @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , the destination @xmath1 broadcasts a pilot signal to allow each of other relays to measure the channel from @xmath1 to itself .",
    "each of the other relays @xmath47 then knows the corresponding value of @xmath49 .    *",
    "3 ) _ message transmission _",
    ": * the source @xmath0 transmits the messages to @xmath33 , and concurrently , the relay nodes with indexes in @xmath50 transmit noise to generate interference at eavesdroppers .",
    "the relay @xmath33 then transmits the messages to destination @xmath1 , and concurrently , the relay nodes with indexes in @xmath51 transmit noise to generate interference at eavesdroppers .    _ remark 1 _ : the parameter @xmath52 involved in the protocol 1 and protocol 2 serves as the threshold on path - loss , based on which the set of noise generating relay nodes can be identified .",
    "notice that a too large @xmath52 may disable legitimate transmission , while a too small @xmath52 may not be sufficient for interrupting all eavesdroppers .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath52 should be set properly to ensure both secrecy requirement and reliability requirement .",
    "_ remark 2 _ : the two protocols considered here have their own advantages and disadvantages and thus are suitable for different network scenarios . for the protocol 1 , it can achieve a better performance in terms of the number of eavesdroppers can be tolerated ( see theorem 1 ) .",
    "however , it involves a complex relay selection process , and more importantly , it results in an unbalanced load and energy consumption distribution among systems nodes .",
    "thus , such protocol is suitable for small scale wireless network with sufficient energy supply rather than large and energy - limited wireless networks ( like wireless sensor networks ) . regarding the protocol 2 ,",
    "although it can tolerate less number eavesdroppers in comparison with the protocol 1 ( see theorem 2 ) , it involves a very simple random relay selection process to achieve a good load and energy consumption distribution among system nodes .",
    "thus , this protocol is more suitable for large scale wireless network environment with stringent energy consumption constraint .",
    "we now analyze that under the protocol 1 the number of eavesdroppers one network can tolerate subject to specified requirements on transmission outage and secrecy outage .",
