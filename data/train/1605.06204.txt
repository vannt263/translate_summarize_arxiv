    "one of the simplest and most frequently studied version of the general three - body problem , is the planar circular restricted three - body problem ( henceforth crtbp ) , which can be stated as follows :    * two primaries , @xmath1 and @xmath2 at positions @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , follow a circular orbit around their common center of mass keeping a fixed distance @xmath5 , while moving at constant angular velocity @xmath6 . *",
    "a third body @xmath7 , that is much smaller than either @xmath1 or @xmath2 , remains in the orbital plane of the primaries .",
    "* the equations of motion are derived only for the test particle @xmath7 , whose motion does not affect the primaries .    the basic formulation of the crtbp dates back to euler , who proposed the use of synodical coordinates @xmath8 instead of the inertial coordinate system @xmath9 , in order to simplify this problem @xcite . the transformation between these two systems can be performed by means of the rotation matrix , is understood .",
    "] ,    @xmath10    using this transformation , lagrange proved the existence of five equilibrium points for the system , named lagrangian points .",
    "the subject of equilibrium points in the crtbp has been studied extensively in the literature ( see _ e.g _ @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the discovery of the trojan asteroids around the lagrangian points @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the sun - jupiter system @xcite , and the recent observations of asteroids around @xmath11 for the sun - earth system @xcite , increased theoretical research on the subject ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that , in spite of the fact that the crtbp is much simpler than the general three - body problem , it is non - integrable , which opened the possibility to analyze systematically the orbits @xcite .    under the assumption of weak fields and low velocities , and as a first approximation to the relativistic crtbp , in 1967",
    "@xcite krefetz considered for the first time the post - newtonian equations of motion for the crtbp , using the einstein - infeld - hoffmann ( eih ) formalism @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian for this system was explicitly presented by contopoulos in 1976 @xcite and some typos for the jacobian constant were corrected by maindl @xcite , who also studied the deviations due to the post - newtonian corrections on the lagrangian points @xcite . concerning analytical solutions to the general relativistic three - body problem ,",
    "yamada @xcite obtained a collinear solution by using the eih approximation up to the first order . in a later paper , they studied the post - newtonian triangular solution for three finite masses , showing that such configuration is not always equilateral @xcite . recently , as a first study of chaos in the post - newtonian crtbp , huang and wu @xcite studied the influence of the separation between the primaries , concluding that if it is close enough , the post - newtonian dynamics is qualitatively different .",
    "in particular , some newtonian bounded orbits become unstable .    to avoid the cumbersome equations of motion that take place in the post - newtonian formalism , steklain and letelier used the paczyski ",
    "wiita pseudo - newtonian potential to study the dynamics of the crtbp in the hill s approximation @xcite , finding that some pseudo - newtonian systems are more stable than their newtonian counterparts .",
    "following this idea , and considering that the jacobian constant is not preserved in the post - newtonian approximation ( which limits the dynamical studies ) , in the present paper we shall use an alternative approach to studying the dynamics of the pseudo - newtonian crtbp . to do so",
    ", we derive an approximate potential for the gravitational field of two uncharged spinless particles modeled as sources with multipole moment @xmath13 , by using the fodor - hoenselaers - perjs ( fhp ) procedure @xcite ( taking into account the corrections made by sotiriou and apostolatos @xcite ) . abusing astrophysical terminology ,",
    "we call the new potential pseudo - newtonian , due to the fact that in this kind of approaches the common newtonian formulas are used even when the resulting potentials do not satisfy the laplace equation . unlike other pseudo - newtonian approaches",
    ", the final expressions are not ad - hoc proposals but are derived directly from the multipole structure of the source .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : pnmeem ] , by means of the fhp procedure , we calculate the gravitational pseudo - potential for each primary ; then we write down the lagrangian of the crtbp with their respective equations of motion for a test particle under the influence of this potential . in section",
    "[ sec : apnd ] , we analyze the gradual transition of the dynamics for the fhp pseudo - newtonian approximation to the classical regime .",
    "the analysis is made using poincar surfaces of section and the variational method for the calculation of the largest lyapunov exponent @xcite .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : cr ] we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "the fodor - hoenselaers - perjs procedure is an algorithm to determine the multipole moments of stationary axisymmetric electrovacuum space - times @xcite .",
    "the method can be stated as follows : in the ernst formalism @xcite , einstein field equations are reduced to a pair of complex equations through the introduction of the complex potentials @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which can be defined in terms of the new potentials @xmath16 and @xmath17 , through the definitions @xmath18 satisfying the alternative representation of the einstein - maxwell field equations , @xmath19 the fields @xmath16 and @xmath17 are related to the gravitational and electromagnetic potentials in a very direct way ,    @xmath20    where @xmath21 with @xmath22 , are analogous to the newtonian mass , angular momentum , electrostatic and magnetic potentials , respectively ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "hereafter , for the sake of convenience , we consider @xmath23 , which implies @xmath24 , _",
    "i.e _ the absence of electromagnetic fields .    now , according to geroch and hansen @xcite , the multipole moments of a given space - time are defined by measuring the deviation from flatness at infinity .",
    "following this idea , the initial 3-metric @xmath25 is mapped to a conformal one , that is @xmath26 .",
    "the conformal factor @xmath27 transforms the potential @xmath16 into @xmath28 , with @xmath29 , and @xmath30 on the other hand , the potential @xmath31 can be written in a power series of @xmath32 and @xmath33 as @xmath34 and the coefficients @xmath35 are calculated by the recursive relations @xcite @xmath36,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 , with @xmath38 and @xmath39 even , and @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "finally , the gravitational multipole moments @xmath43 of the source are computed from their values on the symmetry axis @xmath44 , by means of the following relationships @xmath45 where @xmath46 .    from the previous",
    ", it can be inferred that once we know the gravitational multipole moments , and following the inverse procedure , it is possible to determinate approximate expressions for the gravitational potential @xmath16 , in terms of the physical parameters of the source ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "hence , let us apply the outlined procedure to a concrete example , a source whose multipole structure is given by @xmath47 such that @xmath13 denotes the mass of the source . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rra ] ) and the seed @xmath48 , it can be noted that the only non - vanishing coefficients are @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "thus the potential @xmath16 is reconstructed from ( [ eq : xi - q ] ) , ( [ eq : coordtrans ] ) and @xmath51 , and is explicitly given by @xmath52 it is important to note that the infinite sum of terms of the potential @xmath16 corresponds to the schwarzschild solution , while the lower order of approximation , _",
    "i.e _ by taking the first term , corresponds to the newtonian potential . in order to stress that the approximations different to the lower order do not satisfy the laplace equation , we call the potential @xmath53 , pseudo - newtonian",
    ".    on the other hand , aiming to set up the planar circular restricted three - body problem in our model , we made the following assumptions : _",
    "i ) _ the primaries",
    "are sufficiently far apart to keep moving in a circle ; _ ii ) _ the superposition principle holds , such that the total gravitational potential @xmath54 can be expressed as @xmath55 ; _ iii ) _ we consider only the first correction to the newtonian potential , and _",
    "iv ) _ the motion takes place in the plane @xmath56 .",
    "accordingly , the total potential energy of a test particle with mass @xmath57 in the presence of two pseudo - newtonian sources , in cartesian coordinates , can be written as is explicitly presented in the pseudo - newtonian potential in order to show its contributions ; however , we set @xmath58 in the numerical simulations . ]",
    "@xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the masses of each primary at positions @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively , and @xmath64 .",
    "thus , the lagrangian for the test particle moving in a non - inertial rotating frame , whose origin coincides with the center of mass of the system , in the presence of the potential ( [ eq : uf ] ) is expressed as @xmath65 with @xmath66 the position of the test particle with respect to the center of mass , @xmath67 the magnitude of the velocity of the test particle in the rotating frame and @xmath68 .",
    "consequently , the euler - lagrange equations of motion are @xmath69    finally , the jacobian integral of motion , for this approximation , can be calculated as @xmath70 it can be seen that , the equations ( [ eq : lagf])-([eq : jacf ] ) reduce to the newtonian case in the limit @xmath71 . with some straightforward algebra",
    ", it can be easily shown that the jacobian constan is conserved , that is to say , @xmath72 .",
    "in order to simplify the numerical calculations and to nondimensionalise the problem , we use the szebehely convention @xcite , @xmath73 where @xmath74 $ ] , is the only control parameter for the system , and the center of mass always lies at the origin .",
    "the dynamics of the system will be studied through the poincar sections method and the lyapunov exponents . from now on",
    ", we set @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and units of time such that the angular velocity of the primaries around their common center of mass is @xmath77 .",
    "moreover , with the aim of observing the transition from the classical to the pseudo - newtonian regime , we introduce the following transformation @xmath78 where @xmath79 $ ] , taking the value @xmath80 in the classical limit and @xmath81 in the pseudo - newtonian case .      in the case under consideration , we follow the evolution of the system while keeping the jacobian constant fixed to the value @xmath82 , see figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] . given the initial conditions for @xmath83 and @xmath84 , the initial condition for @xmath85 is determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : jacf ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the orbits in the poincar sections must not cross between them , because the integral of motion is the same for the set of initial conditions considered in each phase space .",
    "orbits for the sets 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 have initial values @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and @xmath88 , respectively . the convention in fig . [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ]",
    "is the following : set of initial conditions 1 is plotted in red color , set 2 in blue , set 3 in black and set 4 in green .    as an additional tool to determine the existence of chaos or regularity of the orbits",
    ", we measure the average largest lyapunov exponent @xmath89 , for each trajectory ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . to do so",
    ", we use the variational method ( which is very accurate for many classes of dynamical systems ) instead of the two - particle approach , because it has been previously shown that the last one could lead to inconsistent values of the @xmath90 , in particular when using arbitrary values of the renormalization time and the initial separation between trajectories @xcite .",
    "the lyapunov exponents larger than the threshold ( dashed black line ) can be considered chaotic , while the ones below the threshold are considered regular .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      over an ensemble of @xmath91 nearby trajectories calculated with the aid of the variational method for the set of initial conditions given in figure [ fig1 ] , for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the inset shows the average value of @xmath90 for small @xmath0.,width=283 ]    from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , it can be noted that in the newtonian problem ( @xmath80 ) there exist chaotic orbits ( green and red ) for the set of initial condition 1 and 4 , coexisting with regular orbits for the sets 2 and 3 .",
    "two special cases can be considered in this figure : the orbit for the set 1 ( red ) corresponds to chaos in a very narrow zone ( weakly perturbed kam tori ) and should correspond to a small value of @xmath90 ; the other case corresponds to orbit 3 ( black ) , in which three small regular islands are present ( surviving tori ) .",
    "if the @xmath0-parameter is slightly increased , the main dynamical changes are observed for this two orbits , as is expected . for values of @xmath0",
    "larger than 0.4 , all the sets of orbits become regular . however , in the pseudo - newtonian limit ( @xmath0 = 1 ) , the narrow chaotic zone appears again for the set 1 , while all the other sets keep regular .",
    "the lyapunov exponent gives us a more detailed description of the system dynamics . from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the large chaotic zone , corresponding to the set of initial conditions 4 , gradually reduces its chaoticity and becomes regular for larger values of @xmath0 .",
    "a very different behavior is observed for the set of initial condition 1 . in the classical limit",
    ", the orbit shows a small value of @xmath90 , for the intermediate values of @xmath0 the orbit turns out regular , and in the pseudo - newtonian limit the small value of @xmath90 emerges again . on the other hand ,",
    "some sporadic appearances of chaos occur for the sets of initial conditions 2 and 3 , but in the limits , @xmath80 and @xmath92 , they are regular .",
    "in the present paper , we propose a new pseudo - newtonian formulation of the planar circular restricted three - body problem , by using the fodor - hoenselaers - perjs procedure .",
    "for this new approximation , the jacobian constant is strictly conserved ( unlike the jacobian obtained in the first - order post - newtonian approximation see _",
    "e.g _ @xcite ) , and its equations of motion reduce to its classical counterpart in the limit @xmath71 . through the poincar section method and validated with the largest lyapunov exponent , we have shown that for the set of initial conditions and jacobian constant selected , the newtonian and pseudo - newtonian crtbp exhibit a mixed phase space , _",
    "i.e _ regular and chaotic orbits coexist",
    ".    the introduction of an arbitrary parameter @xmath0 allowed us to explore the transition from the newtonian to the pseudo - newtonian regime .",
    "if we track the evolution of the system keeping the jacobian constant fixed , a chaotic orbit in the newtonian system can be either chaotic or regular in the pseudo - newtonian limit . in the transition ,",
    "the phase space can be filled by periodic orbits even if some of the orbits are chaotic in the limits @xmath93 and @xmath92 . in accordance with previous studies @xcite , in most of the cases we found that a given set of initial conditions , whose phase space is bounded in the classical regime , correspond to unbounded trajectories in the non - newtonian regime , that is",
    ", the system becomes unstable .",
    "the instability of the orbits is a result of the lack of stable fixed points in the system .",
    "in fact , the number of real roots of the system , when @xmath94 in eqs .",
    "( [ ecfhpx ] ) and ( [ ecfhpy ] ) , varies when varying the mass parameter @xmath95 in the interval @xmath96 $ ] .    in conclusion",
    ", we may say that even the smallest corrections to the newtonian circular restricted three - body problem , could drastically change the dynamics of the system .",
    "in addition , it is important to note that the procedure outlined in the present paper can be used to model different kinds of sources , for example , a pair of massive spinning primaries in circular orbits , or a binary system formed by two non - spherical spinning sources , just to name a few .",
