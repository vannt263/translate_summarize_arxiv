    ", @xcite developed a semi - analytical model to interpret the observations .",
    "they concluded that the intense ultraviolet emission of the quasar may be suppressing the star formation in galaxies that are situated close to the quasar .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of @xcite that laes are clustered around a quasar at @xmath17 but avoid it in its immediate vicinity ( @xmath18 comoving mpc ) .",

    "the results were as puzzling as those at lower redshifts .",
    "no unambiguous relation has been found between galaxy overdensities and @xmath24 quasars , mainly due to the difficulty of finding galaxies with accurate redshifts at so far , these efforts were mainly based on studies of continuum @xmath25-dropout galaxies , characterized by a large magnitude difference between the @xmath25 and @xmath26 bands ( i.e. , using the same technique that was used to detect the quasars ) .",
    "this technique probes a redshift range of approximately @xmath27 , which is large enough to identify galaxies that are not physically related to the quasar .",
    "@xcite carried out a survey with gemini of three @xmath28 quasars .",

    "aperture magnitudes were calculated using a @xmath84 diameter aperture ( @xmath88fwhm of the seeing ) .",
    "the chosen aperture was a good balance between optimizing the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) photometry of point sources and minimizing the amount of flux outside the aperture @xcite .",
    "this size assured that at least @xmath89 of the flux of a point source was inside the aperture .",
    "we also tested larger apertures ( e.g. , 18 diameter ) and the results did not change , but the s / n of the objects slightly decreased .",
    "magnitudes of objects not detected or fainter than @xmath90 limiting magnitudes either in @xmath67 or @xmath70 were replaced by the corresponding @xmath90 limiting magnitude . finally , we only considered objects with s / n greater than 4 , objects with @xmath91 , and with sextractor flag @xmath92 in order to eliminate objects flagged as truncated ( too close to an image boundary ) , incomplete or corrupted .",
    "the final catalog contained 2424 objects .    in order to conclude whether or not an overdensity around the quasar was present , we needed a comparison field obtained at similar depth in a region that did not target a @xmath93 quasar .",
    "for laes we were able to use results from the literature ( see section [ ss : laecomp ] ) , whereas for lbgs there were no @xmath94 dropout searches with large spectroscopic follow - up in the literature .",
    "we performed our own selection of @xmath94 dropouts using the public catalogs of the subaru deep field ( sdf ) imaging survey @xcite , which ( after removing low - quality regions ) had an effective area of @xmath95 arcmin@xmath30 .",
    "the sdf had several characteristics that made it a suitable comparison field for our study .",
    "( 1 ) it is a large field , which helps to reduce cosmic variance .",
    "( 2 ) it has @xmath70 and @xmath67 bands covering similar wavelength ranges compared to the ones in fors2 . (",
    "3 ) there are 42 spectroscopically confirmed @xmath25-dropout galaxies discovered in different studies @xcite , which can be directly used to quantify the accuracy of our lbg selection .",
    "the confirmed @xmath25-dropout galaxies in the sdf were originally selected in the @xmath67-band and all of them have a redshift @xmath96 ( with one exception at @xmath97 ) .",
    "for that reason , these galaxies would either not be detected or have negligible flux in our nb filter .",
    "thus , in order to perform a consistent comparison , we created a second catalog for the j0203 field this time using the @xmath67-band frame as the detection image ( see section [ sec : lbgcomp ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : cmd ] shows the two - color diagram of @xmath98 and @xmath99 for the objects detected in the narrow - band filter and summarizes the selection criteria for lae and dropout candidates .",
    "laes are a population of high - redshift galaxies whose spectra are dominated by a strong ly@xmath13 emission line and have a very flat and faint continuum .",
    "the lae candidates were selected according to the following criteria :    * _ narrow - band excess . _",
    "a positive @xmath98 indicates an excess in the narrow - band flux intensity .",
    "we determine a color cut such that the flux in the narrow - band is twice that in the @xmath67 band : @xmath100 .",
    "this cut corresponds to selecting objects with a rest - frame equivalent width greater than @xmath101 @xmath44(see section [ sec : laeprop ] ) . *",
    "_ continuum break .",
    "_ to differentiate between high - redshift laes and low - redshift emission line interlopers , we require a break in the continuum : @xmath102 .",
    "* _ significance of the narrow - band excess .",
    "_ to avoid contamination by objects that satisfy the color criteria only due to photometric errors , we require : @xmath103 .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : cmd ] , there is one object that satisfies our criteria ( lae 1 ) .",
    "there is another one that is not detected in either of the broad - band images ( lae 2 ) .",
    "lae 2 has a lower limit in the narrow - band excess of @xmath104 .",
    "additionally , when visually inspecting the @xmath67-band image of lae 2 a faint source is apparent",
    ". forced photometry in the @xmath67-band image at the position of lae 2 gives a @xmath105 signal , thus , increasing the chances of lae 2 being a real object .",
    "we consider lae 2 to be a tentative lae candidate , although deeper observations and/or spectroscopy are needed to confirm its nature .",
    "dropout galaxies are also known as lbgs , given that they are selected using the lyman break technique @xcite .",
    "the basis of this method is the fact that hydrogen is very effective at absorbing radiation at wavelengths shorter than @xmath106   @xmath44 ( the lyman limit ) .",
    "therefore , radiation with @xmath107 @xmath44 is strongly suppressed by intergalactic and interstellar absorption , so a very small fraction of these photons will reach us , forming the so - called lyman break . at high - redshifts ,",
    "the ly@xmath13 forest becomes so optically thick that a large fraction of the light coming from @xmath108 @xmath44 to @xmath109 @xmath44 is also absorbed . at this point",
    "the lyman break selection becomes , in effect , a selection of objects with a sharp break at @xmath110  .",
    "dropout candidates were selected with the following criteria :    * _ continuum break . _ a prominent break in the continuum is expected for high - redshift galaxies due to the hydrogen absorption .",
    "we require a continuum break of @xmath111 .",
    "additionally , in an attempt to bias our high - redshift candidates toward a redshift closer to the redshift of the quasar , we require a break between the flux in the nb and @xmath70 filters : @xmath112 .",
    "however , this last criterion has a small effect and excludes only one candidate . *",
    "_ significance of the break .",
    "_ to avoid contamination by objects that only satisfy the color criteria due to photometric errors , we require : @xmath113 . * _ faintness .",
    "_ since high - redshift galaxies are expected to be faint , we impose a minimum magnitude of @xmath114 .",

    "figure [ fig : blank_fields ] shows their cumulative number of laes scaled to our area .",
    "the fact that their numbers are lower than the numbers of the @xcite sample , could be explained by the fact that @xcite could not spectroscopically confirm approximately half of their photometric candidates .",
    "nevertheless , our results are still consistent , within the errors , with the number expected from @xcite .",
    "we conclude that there is no overdensity of laes in the quasar field .",

    "we calculate the input parameters for the filters used in this project , taking into account both the filter curves and the quantum efficiency of the ccd : @xmath154  , @xmath155  , and @xmath156  .",
    "the star formation rates and rest - frame equivalent widths for our two lae candidates from section [ ss : laesel ] are and for lae 1 and lae 2 , respectively ( see figures [ fig : field ] and [ fig : stamps ] ) .",
    "the properties derived for lae 1 are within the expected range for typical laes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* sfr = @xmath157for @xmath158 laes at @xmath46 ) , whereas for lae 2 , the sfr is lower than for typical laes and the equivalent width is only a lower limit .",
    "high - redshift quasars hosting black holes with masses @xmath159 are thought to be hosted by supermassive dark matter halos as suggested by their extremely low comoving density and large black hole masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "no black hole measurement exists for j0203 .",
    "typically , black hole masses of high - redshift quasars are estimated using the single - epoch black hole mass estimators based on continuum luminosities and broad emission lines such as mg@xmath44ii and c@xmath44iv ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for a source at @xmath2 , the mg@xmath44ii line appears at 1.88 @xmath160 m , in the middle of the strong telluric absorption band at @xmath161 m .",
    "moreover , since j0203 is a broad absorption line quasar , the c@xmath44iv line is strongly absorbed ( see figure 7 in mortlock et al .",
    "that is why we can not use these lines to measure the black hole mass of j0203 .",
    "instead , we estimate the quasar eddington luminosity in order to determine the black hole mass , assuming that the central black hole accretes at the eddington limit .",
    "we measure the flux at @xmath162 , yielding a monochromatic luminosity of @xmath163 erg s@xmath56 . using the bolometric correction of 3.81 from @xcite",
    ", we obtain a bolometric luminosity of @xmath164 erg s@xmath56 with 0.2 dex of uncertainty .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath165 with a scatter of 0.2 dex for luminous ( @xmath166 erg s@xmath56 ) @xmath167 quasars . assuming this ratio applies to j0203 , our estimate of the black hole mass is @xmath168 @xmath6 with 0.3 dex uncertainty .",
    "this mass is comparable to the typical black hole masses of the brightest sdss quasars , thus it is plausible that j0203 resides in a massive dark matter halo .",
    "we present a deep study of the lae and @xmath94 dropout population centered on the @xmath2 quasar j0203 with an estimated black hole mass of @xmath169 @xmath6 .",
    "the redshift of the quasar enables a lae narrow - band search in its vicinity .",
    "we detect 2 lae and 20 @xmath94 dropout candidates ( the number of dropout candidates decreases to 8 if we use the narrow band for detection and selection ) .",
    "the lae sample spans a very narrow redshift range around the quasar : @xmath170 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath94 dropout sample spans a larger redshift range as is typical for dropout selections : @xmath74 ( @xmath75 , if the narrow - band filter is added to the selection ) .",
    "the number of @xmath94 dropout candidates in the field of j0203 is consistent with the expected number from the sdf blank field .",
    "however , we find that with our depth and using only two broad bands for the selection , it is very likely that our candidates are highly contaminated .",
    "this implies that we can not establish a reliable estimate of the ( over)density of lbgs around j0203 .      1",
    ".   low number statistics may prevent us from detecting a possible overdensity of emission line galaxies .",
    "if there were an overdensity it would be at least a factor of @xmath171@xmath11 , based on environmental studies of radio galaxies . since we are studying only one quasar , it could be that we are targeting a rare source and that other quasars still harbor overdensities in their surroundings .",
    "this is certainly a possibility , but we believe that it is unlikely given the relatively low counts of laes and lbgs toward other @xmath23 quasars studied to date .",
    "2 .   the lack of neighbors in the immediate vicinity could be due to mergers of galaxies in the halo that hosts the quasar .",
    "we believe that such mergers should not prevent us from detecting an overdensity based on the protoclusters found around radio galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and the recently spectroscopically confirmed lbgs in the vicinities of quasars at @xmath22 found by @xcite , which in principle should have been affected in the same manner .",
    "3 .   the strong ionizing radiation from the quasar may prevent galaxy formation in its surroundings .",
    "there are several studies that support this claim ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and therefore it would be important to understand and quantify this effect in order to consider it in simulations .",
    "indeed , our results present evidence to support this idea because none of our candidates are at a distance closer than @xmath18 comoving mpc ( @xmath172 physical mpc ) , as can be seen in figure [ fig : field ] and table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "this is similar to the results presented by @xcite and @xcite , i.e. , that galaxies avoid the vicinity of a quasar within distances of @xmath18 comoving mpc and @xmath37 comoving mpc , respectively .",
    "+ yet , the quasar ionization hypothesis fails to explain why apparent overdensities are found in the vicinities of other high - redshift quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "further , we believe that is hard to reconcile a hypothesis in which the radiation affects the environment isotropically , with the unified agn model where quasars have two collimated beams .",
    "however , contrary to the ionization hypothesis , @xcite suggest that the radiation of the quasar may enhance the number of laes in its surroundings .",
    "they show that gas - rich objects with little or no associated star formation , known as proto - galactic clouds or dark galaxies , can be detected thanks to the ly@xmath13 fluorescence induced by a nearby quasar .",
    "one of the main characteristics of these sources is a high ly@xmath13 equivalent width a detailed comparison with @xcite is challenging because of the different redshifts and because the lyman limit luminosity of our quasar , calculated following @xcite , is about one order of magnitude smaller than the luminosity of the hyperluminous quasar ( hlqso ) observed by @xcite .",
    "additionally , since j0203 is a broad absorption line quasar @xcite , it is possible that the amount of escaping ionizing radiation is lower than expected in typical quasars .",
    "+ nevertheless , in our study , we do not find such fluorescent clouds .",
    "it should be noted that in our work , lae 1 has an @xmath173 @xmath44 which has a 4% probability of having @xmath44based on the uncertainties of the measured fluxes and lae 2 only has a lower limit of 4 .",
    "high - redshift quasars may not reside in the most massive halos .",
    "it is expected that the relation between black hole mass and halo mass that arises from combining the local relations between black hole and bulge mass on the one hand , and the relation between galaxy and halo mass on the other , is significantly different ( both in slope and in scatter ) at high redshift .",
    "evidence for this has been found recently at @xmath174 by @xcite who studied fifteen hlqsos ( @xmath175 ; @xmath176 ) that are associated with galaxy overdensities .",
    "the authors conclude that hlqsos do not require environments very different from their much less luminous quasar counterparts and are not being hosted by rarer dark matter halos .",
    "however , if this applies to the @xmath23 quasars as well , one would have to explain their extremely low space density .",
    "one possibility is that , due to selection effects , the bright quasars thus far discovered are biased toward more average - sized halos that are inhabited by very massive black holes . 5 .",
    "high - redshift quasars may not always reside in highly overdense , large - scale environments .",
    "all observational evidence considered , there appears to be a trend for @xmath23 quasars to sit in low - to - average galaxy environments on megaparsec scales .",
    "@xmath54cdm predictions have shown that the most massive halos at high redshift do not invariably grow into the most massive ones at low redshift . moreover , the most massive present - day structures ( clusters ) originated primarily from regions that were overdense on very large scales ( tens of megaparsec ) at @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "although few studies have probed out to such large radii and with significant sensitivity , the lack of companion galaxies on megaparsec scales may indicate that the quasars do not pinpoint progenitors of the most massive clusters even if the quasars themselves are hosted by very massive halos .",
    "it is also possible that quasars reside in large - scale overdense environments , but just not in the center of them .",
    "studies with larger fields - of - view are required to test this hypothesis .",
    "one question that emerges naturally is why radio - galaxy - based protocluster surveys have been much more successful than any quasar - based protocluster survey . from a theoretical perspective , n. fanidakis & orsi ( 2013 , in preparation ) suggest that radio galaxies and quasars are observational manifestations of different accretion states , which are determined by the accretion and black hole properties and the large scale environment .",
    "quasars accrete vast amounts of gas and form in the gas - rich environments of intermediate mass ( @xmath177 ) dark - matter halos @xcite .",
    "radio galaxies , in comparison , are powered by rapidly spinning black holes that typically inhabit the centers of the most massive ( @xmath178 ) dark matter halos in the universe and accrete low - density gas ( for the properties of their agn model ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the largest concentrations of baryons are expected to be found within these halos and thus , radio galaxies can be used to pinpoint the location of large galaxy overdensities .",
    "the suggestion of a discrete halo environment of quasars and radio galaxies is also supported by clustering analysis of agns in the low - redshift universe ( @xmath179 ; e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more detailed studies of the environment and of the host galaxy of high - redshift quasars are needed to clarify the picture of overdensities around quasars .",
    "future observational campaigns targeting high - redshift quasars either at @xmath46 , @xmath47 , or @xmath180 ( corresponding to the few gaps of oh night - sky emission bands where narrow - band filters can be most effectively targeted to detect ly@xmath13 emission ) will be crucial to increase the sample and to quantify possible object - to - object variations .    based on observations made with eso telescopes at the la silla paranal observatory under program",
