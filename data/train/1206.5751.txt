    "sleep''_. the dormant phase in the evolutionary course of a radio galaxy and fate of the radio - emitting plasma after the cessation of the nuclear activity are among the most intriguing issues in extragalactic astronomy .",
    "the active stage of a powerful radio source , typically associated with an elliptical galaxy , can last several @xmath4 up to few @xmath5 years . during this time",
    ", the radio galaxy is likely fed by mass accretion onto the supermassive black hole of the host galaxy .",
    "once this accretion is interrupted , or becomes insufficient to support radio activity , the radio source enters a dying phase ; the radio emission passively evolves and rapidly fades , even if expansion losses are negligible and the relativistic electrons are subject only to radiative losses .",
    "this is reflected into a pronounced steepening of the integrated radio spectrum whose slope @xmath6 can reach ultra - steep values , @xmath7 , adopting the convention @xmath8 for the synchrotron spectrum , where @xmath9 is the flux density at the frequency @xmath10 .",
    "eventually , the radio emission disappears below the detection limit of present radio telescopes .    during the fading stage of a radio source",
    ", the central nucleus may switch on again and produce new radio activity , thus leading to a restarted radio source .",
    "evidence for episodic radio activities are reported in the literature for a growing number of radio galaxies ( see , for instance , saikia & jamrozy 2009 for a review ) .",
    "double - double radio galaxies @xcite qualify as one of the most unmistakable examples of recurrent nuclear activity ; here a new pair of inner lobes are produced close to the nucleus before the previously generated , more distant ones have completely faded .",
    "another type of restarted radio sources are `` nesting '' radio galaxies @xcite , i.e. , sources characterized by a faint , extended structure , within which a bright radio source , extended on a significantly smaller scale , is embedded .",
    "examples are hercules a @xcite , 3c310 @xcite , and 4c29.30 @xcite . in few well - studied cases , the large",
    " scale emission and inner source appear clearly , and quite sharply , separated in the spectral index distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with much steeper spectral index values measured for the outer emission .",
    "this has been interpreted as evidence for different epochs of jet activity , with the more extended and steeper component being related to an earlier outburst of the central active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .    in this paper , we focus on the complex radio source associated with the elliptical galaxy ngc1407 ( see table [ tab : ngc1407 ] ) , at the center of the poor group of galaxies eridanus  a at z=0.0059 , with a one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath11372 km  s@xmath12 @xcite and 0.3 - 2 kev x - ray luminosity of @xmath13 erg  s@xmath12 @xcite .",

    "the upper limit at 74 mhz suggests a low - frequency flattening of the spectrum , with @xmath61 below 240 mhz .",
    "we fitted the spectrum of the inner double using a continuous injection ( ci ) model ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , in which the source is continuously replenished by a constant flow of fresh relativistic electrons with a power - law energy distribution in a region of constant magnetic field . under these assumptions ,",

    "this model assumes an initial phase of electron injection at a constant rate by the nuclear source ( ci phase ) , followed by a switch - off of the nuclear activity .",
    "a dying phase then begins , with the radio emission rapidly fading subject to the energy losses of the relativistic electrons .",
    "it is assumed that the magnetic field strength is uniform within the source , energy losses are dominant with respect to other processes , and the pitch angle of the radiating electrons has an isotropic distribution with respect to the local direction of the magnetic field .",
    "we imposed an initial spectral index @xmath63=0.7 , similar to the observed @xmath6 of the inner double ( tab .",

    "the two profiles along the large - scale component were fitted separately adopting a ci@xmath69 model ( sect .",

    "@xmath118 mhz and @xmath119 mhz , respectively  and a ratio @xmath120 of 0.6 and 0.5 .",
    "using the average between these values and a magnetic field strength of 2.1 @xmath50 g ( table 5 ) , we estimated a total age of @xmath121 myr .",
    "the ci phase lasted approximately 92 myr and the nuclear engine switched off @xmath3172 myr ago .    the total age derived here is shorter than the lower limit of @xmath3320 myr obtained from the fit of the total spectrum ( table 5 ) .",
    "a reason for such discrepancy may lie in the use of different areas to extract the flux densities in the two cases ; the region used to derive the total spectrum corresponds to the whole area occupied by the diffuse emission at 240 mhz , including the emission which is the most distant from the center and , thus , plausibly the oldest . the circular regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : steep ] sample instead only a part of that region .",
    "another consideration is that the spectral index between 240 mhz and 610 mhz ( @xmath122 ) is slightly flatter than the average slope of the total spectrum , i.e. , @xmath60 between 240 mhz and 1.4 ghz .",
    "this could result in a break frequency from the spectral trend fitting which is higher than that estimated from the total spectrum , thus yielding a shorter age ( for the same magnetic field strength ) .",
    "finally , it is important to bear in mind that both methods rely on the age determination from the break frequency , which has large uncertainties due to the number of underlying assumptions ( see discussion in section [ sec : age ] ) .",

    ", standard aging analyses , based on the position of the break frequency in the synchrotron spectrum , can give incorrect estimates of the age of the radio emitting electrons .",
    "we compared the energy output associated with synchrotron radiation from the two radio outbursts in ngc1407 . using the radio luminosity at 240 mhz and @xmath63 in table 5 , we calculated the total radio luminosity over the frequency range 10 mhz100 ghz adopting the expression in @xcite .",

    "a direct measurement of the mechanical power of the radio jets in either period of activity is therefore not possible . if the mean jet mechanical power to radio power ratio has remained constant over the outburst history , ngc1407 would then be another system in which the total energy output from the agn is decreasing with time",
    "on the other hand , the most recent episode of activity may be still ongoing ( its radiative age is @xmath330 myr ) , and it is possible that the jet power may increase .      assuming energy equipartition arguments",

    "[ fig : press ] does not cover the whole extent of the radio emission , it is clear that the pressure of the x - ray gas is at least one order of magnitude higher than the radio pressure , with values ranging from @xmath145 erg @xmath83 at @xmath310 kpc from the center to @xmath146 erg @xmath83 at @xmath147 kpc .",

    "the x - ray trail visible in the  image ( fig .",

    "the diffuse radio structure also shows a swept - back shape , but on a larger scale , similar to wide - angle tail ( wat ) radio galaxies , although no jets are present .",
    "as discussed above , this emission is found to be the remnant of a former radio outburst of the central galaxy , consistent with the absence of jets .",
    "the x - ray wings seem to be inside the radio emission , and the radio contours appear compressed at the northern edge ( e.g. , fig.[fig : temp ] ) .    the similarities in the radio and x - ray morphologies suggest that the two structures are co - spatial and both affected by the motion of the galaxy . the x - ray wings may then represent a wake of cooler galactic material which has been stripped by the same ram - pressure that bent the diffuse radio emission .",
    "there are several ways in which we can obtain rough estimates of the velocity of ngc1407 relative to the igm .",

    "this gives a very low velocity , only @xmath163 20 km s@xmath12 .",
    "alternatively , we can make a simple calculation assuming that the galaxy is moving north , that the radio outburst was located where we now see the southern boundary of the diffuse structure , and that it has moved at a constant velocity since that time . neglecting projection effects and basing our estimate on the 240  mhz map , the galaxy",
    "would then have traveled 28 - 35  kpc over a period of @xmath3300  myr , suggesting a velocity of 90 - 115 km s@xmath12 .",
    "these velocity estimates conflict to some extent with the x - ray morphology .",
    "if a cold front is present in ngc  1407 , we would expect the galaxy to be moving at a significant fraction of the sound speed .",
    "for a temperature of 1.1  kev , as is found immediately north of the surface brightness edge , the sound speed is @xmath164500 km s@xmath12 , so a velocity of at least 250 km s@xmath12 would be likely .    however , there are large uncertainties on our estimates .",
    "if sloshing is taking place , the most likely cause is perturbation by a tidal encounter with ngc1400 . given the 1100 km",
    "s@xmath12 velocity offset between ngc1400 and the group mean , it is clear that sloshing motions would include a significant line of sight component . since we see signs of a surface brightness edge in the x - ray and compressed contours in the radio , the velocity in the plane of the sky is greater than or comparable to that in the line of sight , but this still leaves an uncertainty of up to a factor @xmath165 in the true velocity of ngc1407",
    ". the velocity could thus be as high as 160 km s@xmath12 , or 0.3@xmath166 .",
    "projection effects could have an impact on our estimate of the ram - pressure timescale .",

    "the lobes would be at a larger radius than we have assumed , and would experience lower external pressures .",
    "mixing of entrained thermal plasma into the lobes would raise their effective density . both of these factors could increase the ram  pressure velocity estimate , though it is difficult to place limits on their impact .    as discussed above ,",
    "the x - ray images of ngc1407 suggest that the group is not relaxed .",

    "we compared the synchrotron energy output associated with the two radio outbursts and found that the energy released during the duration of its current activity is nearly an order of magnitude lower than that from the former outburst .",
    "numerous studies in the literature have shown that the synchrotron luminosity is an underestimate of the total energy output of a radio source , which is dominated by the mechanical work done by the jets on the external medium .",
    "if the mean jet power remained constant over the whole outburst history of ngc1407 , then ngc1407 would be another example of a system in which the energy output is decreasing with time , other examples being hydra a and ngc5813 . on the other hand , the most recent episode of activity may be still ongoing , and it is possible that the jet power may increase .",
    "we analyzed _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observations of the group .",
    "the diffuse emission surrounding ngc  1407 appears swept back to the south , with wings extending to the east and west , and a possible surface brightness discontinuity on the northern side of the galaxy .",
    "temperature mapping shows the emission inside the edge to be cooler than that to the north , but the data are shallow and the smoothing scale is too large to confirm whether a cold front or weak shock is present .",
    "the northern edge coincides with regions of compressed radio contours , and the large  scale radio structure also has a swept ",
    "back morphology , indicating that the radio and x - ray structures are co  spatial and affected by the same forces . in general ,",
    "the radio and x  ray morphology are suggestive of northward motion .",
    "we speculate that the group core may be sloshing on a north  south axis within the larger group potential , having been tidally disturbed by an encounter with the nearby elliptical ngc1400 .",
    "our estimated velocity in the plane of the sky is relatively low ( @xmath3100 km s@xmath12 ) , but given the large uncertainties it seems possible that the true velocity could be a significant fraction of the sound speed , in which case sloshing motions could produce the radio and x - ray features we observe .",
    "comparison of pressure estimates for the large  scale radio structure and the surrounding intra  group medium show the usual order  of  magnitude difference , the x  ray pressure estimate being much higher than that found from the radio data .",
    "this may indicate a large population of non  radiating particles within the radio structure , with a total energy @xmath3100 - 1000 times that of the relativistic electron population .",
    "if , as seems likely , the structure was formed by a previous agn outburst , these particles could be relativistic protons accelerated within the original radio jets , or a thermal plasma component which has been entrained during the propagation and expansion of the jets and lobes .",
    "the latter possibility provides an explanation for the continued presence of the radio structure in the group core , since buoyant forces , which would normally lift the lobes into the outskirts of the group halo , will be suppressed if the lobes contain a large fraction of thermal plasma .",

    "<S> we present deep _ giant metrewave radio telescope _ ( ) radio observations at 240 , 330 and 610 mhz of the complex radio source at the center of the ngc1407 galaxy group . previous   observations at 240 mhz revealed faint , diffuse emission enclosing the central twin - jet radio galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this has been interpreted as an indication of two possible radio outbursts occurring at different times . </S>",

    "<S> data at 1.4 and 4.9 ghz , we derive the total spectrum of both components . </S>",
    "<S> the inner double has a spectral index @xmath0 , typical for active , extended radio galaxies , whereas the spectrum of the large - scale emission is very steep , with @xmath1 between 240 mhz and 1.4 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> the radiative age of the large - scale component is very long , @xmath2 myr , compared to @xmath330 myr estimated for the central double , confirming that the diffuse component was generated during a former cycle of activity of the central galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the current activity have so far released an energy which is nearly one order of magnitude lower than that associated with the former outburst . </S>",
    "<S> the group x - ray emission in the  and -newton images and extended radio emission show a similar swept - back morphology . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that the two structures are both affected by the motion of the group core , perhaps due to the core sloshing in response to a recent encounter with the nearby elliptical galaxy ngc1400 . </S>"
