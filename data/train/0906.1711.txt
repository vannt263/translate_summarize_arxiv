    "<S> the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum compass model in a transverse magnetic field is studied in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> an exact solution is obtained by using an extended jordan and wigner transformation to the pseudo - spin operators . </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity susceptibility , the concurrence , the block - block entanglement entropy , and the pseudo - spin correlation functions are calculated with antiperiodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the qpt driven by the transverse field only emerges at zero field and is of the second - order . </S>",
    "<S> several critical exponents obtained by finite size scaling analysis are the same as those in the 1d transverse field ising model , suggesting the same universality class . a logarithmic divergence of the entanglement entropy of a block at the quantum critical point is also observed . from the calculated coefficient connected to the central charge of the conformal field theory , </S>",
    "<S> it is suggested that the block entanglement depends crucially on the detailed topological structure of a system . </S>"
