    "extreme value statistics ( evs ) , pioneered by the works of @xcite and @xcite , is a branch of statistics that deals with the statistical modelling of extreme events that substantially deviate from the mean behaviour .",
    "the principal characteristics of evs is the fact that , for independently identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) random variables , the distribution of the extrema converges to a member of the generalized extreme value ( gev ) distribution .",
    "while evs being widely spread in the environmental and economic sciences , it has not seen many applications to astrophysics so far . for the first time",
    ", evs was applied to the study of the statistics of the brightest cluster galaxies by @xcite and subsequently to the temperature maxima in the cmb by @xcite .",
    "it has also been applied to the solar cycle @xcite and to solar radio bursts @xcite and in a cosmological context to gaussian random fields @xcite .",
    "recently , mainly triggered by the detection of very massive galaxy clusters at high redshifts like xmmu j2235.32557 at @xmath1 @xcite , act - cl j0102 at @xmath2 @xcite and spt - cl j2106 at @xmath3 @xcite , the application of evs on massive clusters has been studied in several works .",
    "@xcite related for the first time the gev distribution parameters to cosmological quantities and compared the approach to numerical n - body simulations .",
    "the impact of primordial non - gaussianity on the evs of galaxy clusters has been studied by @xcite .",
    "a direct approach , based on the exact rather than the asymptotic form , has been utilized by to study the halo mass function and the possibility to use extreme clusters to test cosmological models .",
    "@xcite proposed to utilise the gev distribution as a cosmological probe by dividing the survey area in small equally sized patches allowing to reconstruct the distribution of the most massive haloes in those patches .",
    "gev was also used in @xcite to show that none of the known massive clusters alone is in conflict with @xmath4cdm and that there is no indication of high-@xmath5 clusters to be rarer than low-@xmath5 ones .    in this work",
    "we study the application of an alternative approach in the framework of evs , which is based on the statistical modelling of the distribution of excesses ( hereafter referred also to as exceedances ) over a high threshold .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that for high thresholds the distribution of exceedances converges to the generalized pareto distribution ( gpd ) which is closely related to the gev distribution .",
    "the gpd distribution function allows to infer the probability that a given observation exceeds a high threshold by a certain amount and hence we utilise this approach to derive the distribution of the exceedances in mass of galaxy clusters over a high - mass threshold .",
    "since surveys based on the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz)-effect @xcite , like the _ south pole telescope _ ( _ spt _ ) survey @xcite for instance , can be considered to be mass - limited , we study as well whether a gpd based approach could be utilized as a cosmological probe .",
    "this paper is structured according to the following scheme . in section  [ sec : evs ] we introduce extreme value statistics by discussing the application of the gnedenko approach to massive galaxy clusters in section  [ sec : gev ] .",
    "this is followed by an introduction to the modelling of exceedances with the pareto approach and its connection to the gnedenko approach in section  [ sec : gpd ] . in section",
    "[ sec : exceed ] , we apply the pareto approach to massive high-@xmath5 clusters in general .",
    "this is followed by an example application to two observed clusters in section  [ sec : example_appl ] , where in section  [ subsec : prep_consid ] we discuss several observational effects that have to be taken into account and in section  [ subsec : single_results ] we present the results of this exercise .",
    "after this analysis , we discuss in section  [ sec : param_estim ] the possible application of exceedance models to sz cluster surveys as a cosmological probe and compare it with a gev based approach .",
    "then , we summarise our findings in the conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",

    "extreme value statistics ( for an introduction see e.g. @xcite ) concerns with the stochastic behaviour of the extremes ( in what follows we consider only maxima ) of i.i.d . random variables . in this sense evs tries to model the unlikely and to give a quantitative answer to the question how frequent unusual observations are .",
    "there are two different approaches that are utilized in the literature and that will be briefly summarized in the following .",
    "the gnedenko approach deals with the modelling of the block maxima @xmath10 of i.i.d .",
    "random variables @xmath11 , which are defined as @xmath12 it has been shown @xcite that for @xmath13 the limiting cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the renormalised block maxima is given by one of the extreme value families : gumbel ( type i ) , frchet ( type ii ) or weibull ( type iii ) .",

    "is given by @xmath22 from now on we will adopt the convention that capital initial letters denote the cdf ( like @xmath23 ) and small initial letters denote the pdf ( like @xmath24 ) .    a formalism for the application of gev to the most massive galaxy clusters has been introduced by @xcite and is briefly summarized in the following . by introducing the random variable @xmath25 , the cdf of the most massive halo reads @xmath26 this probability has to be equal to the one of finding no halo with a mass larger than @xmath27 .",
    "on scales ( @xmath28 ) for which the clustering between galaxy clusters can be neglected , the cdf is given by the poisson distribution for the case of zero occurrence @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the effective comoving number density of halos above mass @xmath25 obtained by averaging and @xmath31 is the comoving volume . by assuming that equation   can be modelled by @xmath32 ,",
    "it is possible to relate the gev parameters to cosmological quantities by taylor - expanding both @xmath32 and @xmath33 around the peaks of the corresponding pdfs . by comparing the individual first two expansion terms with each other",

    "exceedance theory spreads , originating mainly from hydrological literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) , into many fields of applied statistics .",
    "the basic notion is that , instead of studying the distribution of the maxima in blocks of random variables as in equation  , an alternative view is to consider realisations @xmath11 drawn from an underlying distribution @xmath42 as extreme , if they exceed a very high threshold @xmath43 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "thus , one is interested in the conditional probability @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the exceedance over the threshold @xmath43 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that , for very high thresholds , if the block maxima have an approximative distribution @xmath23 , the distribution of the exceedances can be approximated by the _ generalized pareto distribution _ ( gpd ) , given by @xmath46^{-1/\\kappa } , & \\quad { \\rm for}\\quad\\kappa\\neq 0,\\\\      1- { \\mathrm{e}}^{-y/ \\tilde{\\beta } } , & \\quad { \\rm for}\\quad\\kappa = 0,\\\\    \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where the gpd parameters are related to the gev parameters via @xmath47 and the exceedance @xmath45 is given by @xmath48 here all the parameters @xmath18 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are identical to the gev parameters introduced before .",
    "for @xmath49 the gpd and the gev distribution are related by @xmath50 if @xmath51 . in this way , once the gev parameters from equation   are determined , also the gpd is fully determined . for small existence probabilities",
    "( @xmath23 close to @xmath52 ) , both distributions will coincide according to equation  .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gpdvsgev ] , from which it can be inferred that for clusters with an existence probability of less than @xmath53 per cent the two distributions differ by less than @xmath52 per cent . for galaxy clusters that are more likely to be found ,",
    "the cdfs of both distribution start to significantly deviate from each other , such that , for a cluster with a @xmath54 per cent existence probability , the deviation is larger than @xmath55 per cent .",
    "it is important at this point to note that both cdfs are correct in the sense that they just give answers to different statistical questions .",
    "the gev distribution is the distribution of the most massive cluster to be found in a given cosmic volume , whereas the gpd is the distribution of the exceedance of all clusters above a high - mass threshold under the condition that the threshold is exceeded . in the case of rare clusters",
    "both distributions give identical answers , but for less rare clusters they can significantly differ .",
    "usually , when dealing with data based on an unknown underlying distribution and if the gpd parameters have to be determined from the data , then an appropriate choice of the threshold becomes crucial .",
    "when chosen too low , the limit law of the gpd is violated resulting in a bias ; if it is chosen too high , data are so sparse that the variance in the parameter estimation is large . since we will determine the gpd parameters via the formalism introduced in sect .",

    ", the limit law of the gpd can be assumed to be valid .",
    "this choice of the threshold is conservative and we do not attempt in this work to estimate the lowest possible threshold , which is usually done in an empirical way from the data . in principle",
    "there are two ways for the threshold estimation ( see e.g. @xcite ) : the first one is based on the notion that the mean excess should approximately be a linear function of @xmath43 if the limit law is fulfilled and the second method is based on the expected stability of the estimated shape parameter for high enough thresholds . to assess",

    "it is very difficult to test cosmological models based on a single survey patch and thus on a single observation of the most massive cluster in the survey area .",
    "one solution to this problem is either to use many patches and to try to reconstruct the cdf of the most massive systems for a given patch - size and redshift range , or to take a single patch , provided the survey is deep enough , and to apply the exceedance approach introduced in sect .",
    "[ sec : gpd ] . in doing so , instead of dividing the survey area into small patches",
    ", one uses all the information from objects above a given mass threshold , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] . at this point",
    "the survey selection function comes into play , which can cause a big problem to this approach since the limiting mass is usually an increasing function with redshift , which makes it difficult to define a threshold above which all clusters can be detected .",
    "an exception to this are surveys based on the sz effect @xcite , since those exhibit an almost constant limiting survey - mass ( see e.g. @xcite ) which would make them in principle ideally suited to an application of the exceedance theory .    as a case study we decided to consider a _",

    "we are modelling thresholds @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is given in @xmath70 , with @xmath71 and compute the gpd distributions of the exceedances above a given threshold from the individual gev analysis , as discussed in sect .",

    "both the cdfs and the pdfs show , as expected , that the higher the threshold is the less probable high exceedances are .",
    "similarly the same holds for increasing the lower redshift , as can be seen by inspecting the panels from left to right .",
    "+ apart from the exceedance distributions themselves , it is also possible to calculate the mean exceedance @xmath73 and the variance @xmath74 , which are simply given by @xmath75 for both relations the choice of the threshold enters via @xmath76 , defined in equation  , and the second moment exists only if the condition @xmath77 is fulfilled .",
    "this requirement is met for all cases of interest of this work .",

    "the red dotted line illustrates the mean exceedance for the _ spt _ survey area of @xmath80 .",
    "as expected , the mean exceedance is a decreasing function of the threshold , since the larger the threshold is the smaller the expected exceedances are .",
    "of course , for a fixed threshold the larger survey area yields larger exceedances . like the mean also the variance is a decreasing function of the threshold .",
    "after having introduced the basic theory in the previous sections , we present now an example application of the exceedance theory to two single sz clusters in the _ atacama cosmology telescope _ ( _ act _ ) @xcite and _ spt _ @xcite fields .",

    "due to the fact that act - cl j0102 lies in the overlap region of the _ act _ and _ spt _ survey areas , we conservatively assign the combined survey area of @xmath84 to this system .",

    "this extraordinary system is the most massive cluster at redshifts @xmath86 .      before performing a statistical analysis of single galaxy clusters ,",
    "one has in general to account for two different effects that can substantially change the results .    1 .",
    "the correction for the eddington bias @xcite : due to the steepness of the mass function at the high - mass end , it is more likely that lower mass systems scatter up than higher mass systems scatter down , resulting in a systematic shift to higher masses . due to this effect , clusters appear to be rarer than they actually are .",
    "the bias discussed in @xcite that stems from the a posteriori choice of the redshift interval for the statistical analysis .",
    "if the lower redshift boundary is set to the cluster redshift , one pushes the rareness of a given cluster to the maximum .",
    "however , a cluster of a given mass could have easily shown up at another redshift .",
    "if not accounted for , this bias , like the eddington bias , lets clusters appear to be rarer than they are .",
    "the strategies for correcting for these effects have been already discussed in @xcite , thus we will only briefly summarise them at this point .",
    "we correct for the eddington bias , following @xcite , by shifting the observed mass , @xmath87 , to a corrected mass , @xmath88 , by @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the local slope of the mass function ( @xmath91 ) and @xmath92 is the uncertainty in the mass measurement ( for more details see @xcite )",
    ". we account for the bias discussed in @xcite by a priori choosing the redshift ranges @xmath93 $ ] . in order to compare theory with observations on the same grounds , it is usually necessary to unify the mass definitions .",
    "the observationally reported masses are frequently defined considering an overdensity computed with respect to the critical one @xmath94 , whereas in the mass function of @xcite for instance , the mean background density @xmath95 ) is assumed . for the clusters we discuss in this work , no correction is necessary because the observed masses are already given in @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , we adopt from @xcite for the mass of act - cl j0102 a value of @xmath97 and for spt - cl j2106 a value of @xmath98 that we will use hereafter .      the results of our gpd analysis are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : single_clust ] , in which we present the cdfs ( upper panels ) and pdfs ( lower panels ) of the exceedance over different thresholds @xmath99 ( from left to right ) based on a combined survey area of @xmath84 and for different lower redshift limits comprising @xmath100 .",
    "the upper redshift limit is kept fixed at @xmath101 , since it has only a weak impact on the distribution functions .",
    "the grey shaded areas denote the uncertainties in the observed masses .",
    "as expected , act - cl j0102 sits further in the tail of the distributions than spt - cl j2106 , because its mass is higher and thus the exceedance is larger . with increasing the threshold",
    "the clusters move to smaller exceedances and become thus more likely to be found .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the distributions are sensitive to the choice of @xmath102 in the sense that for smaller @xmath102 the clusters are more likely to be found .",
    "we also calculated the probability to find @xmath103 for a fixed observed mass , @xmath104 , as a function of threshold and present the results in fig .",

    "we use @xmath105 and the redshift interval @xmath106 . for the latter , we use @xmath107 and the redshift interval @xmath79 .",
    "we chose these specific redshift intervals a priori in order to avoid the previously mentioned bias and to be directly comparable with the study in @xcite .",
    "the black solid line denotes @xmath108 and the black dashed lines denoted the upper ( lower ) allowed mass limits @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "we also added a red arrow together with a red dotted line in order to denote the probability for the particular choice of the threshold , @xmath49 , and for comparison we added a small black arrow pointing to the probability obtained from a gev analysis @xcite . from the position of the black arrow with respect to the red dotted line , one can infer that the gpd delivers lower probabilities of existence than the gev analysis .",
    "the reason and nature of this difference has already been discussed in section  [ sec : gpd ] . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gpdvsgev ] , the two approaches give similar results for very rare clusters only .",
    "this is also the reason why the difference between the arrow and the red dotted line is smaller for spt - cl j2106 in the right - hand panel compared to act - cl j0102 in the left - hand panel . since the redshift intervals have been chosen a priori , the former cluster appears to be rarer than the latter . at this point",
    "it should be repeated that both probabilities from the gev and the gpd approach are correct , since they are not the answer to the same statistical question .",
    "apart from theoretically modelling exceedances for a given cosmological model , the gpd - based approach could be advantageous for the estimation of the gev parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . instead of only using block - maxima ( the most massive clusters observed in smaller patches ) as suggested in @xcite , a gpd approach would use the information from all observed systems above a given high - mass threshold",

    "we calculate the probability distributions of the exceedances for a range of thresholds and redshift bins .",
    "as expected , the pdfs fall steeper to zero the larger the threshold is chosen for a fixed survey area and redshift range .",
    "the same applies if the threshold is kept fixed but one considers the volume of interest to be placed at higher redshifts .    with the possibility to analytically derive the distribution of the threshold excesses , we apply the gpd approach to two sz clusters , namely act - cl j0102 and spt - cl j2106 , that have been observed in the combined survey area of act and spt . for our calculations we assigned to each individual system a priori a redshift range for which we perform the analysis",
    "this is done in order to avoid the bias that arises from the a posteriori choice of the volume , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "none of the two clusters is in tension with the @xmath140cdm cosmology , as discussed in @xcite , and also the gpd - based approach leads to the same conclusion .",
    "this result is in agreement with the conclusions drawn in the recent works of @xcite , and @xcite who find no tension with @xmath4cdm for individual clusters .",
    "since spt - cl j2106 , due to its position in the redshift interval , appears to be rarer than act - cl j0102 , the gev and gpd approach deliver very similar probabilities , as it has been discussed above .",
    "so far we summarized the results for the potential application to single systems . in the second part of this work",
    ", we discussed whether the gpd might potentially be used as a cosmological probe or not . in @xcite",
    ", we proposed to utilise gev as a cosmological probe by means of dividing the survey area in equally sized patches and to measure the mass of the most massive cluster in the patch . in this way it would be possible to reconstruct the distribution of the maxima and to compare it with the theoretical expectations .",
    "we could show that the position of the peak of the pdf is the most promising gev parameter due to its strong dependence on the underlying cosmology .    for a survey like the _ spt _ one",
    ", the determination of the distribution parameters via maximum likelihood methods should be superior in the gpd case with respect to the gev one , since we expect more clusters to be found above a threshold than block maxima by dividing the survey into smaller patches .",
    "the increased amount of information should in principle reduce the variance in the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters and therefore result in tighter constraints on deviations from the @xmath4cdm model . in order to test this naive assumption",
    "we performed a sampling experiment for which we created random realisations of the gpd and the gev distributions and calculated the mle - estimates for different sample sizes .",
    "we found that the location parameter @xmath141 , which is tightly related to the most likely maximum mass that should be found in a given volume , can be estimated with the highest precision with respect to the two other gev parameters @xmath142 and @xmath143 in both approaches .",
    "however , in the gpd approach a much larger number of realisations ( clusters ) is needed with respect to the patch - based gev approach . for the latter",
    "already @xmath0 patches are sufficient to reach a percent level accuracy on @xmath141 . from this point of view",
    ", it seems that the gev based approach is far superior to the gpd based one .",
    "the remaining challenge , however , will be to get observational biases stemming from uncertainties in the mass measurements and the resulting confusion of less massive clusters as the most massive one .",
    "thus , the main conclusions of this work can be summarized as follows .    1",
    ".   the excess of very massive high - mass clusters can be analytically modelled with the generalized pareto distribution .",
    "2 .   for rare clusters , the gpd and the gev based modelling lead to identical existence probabilities for extreme galaxy clusters . 3 .   modelling of exceedances by means of the gpd approach seems to be disfavoured as a cosmological probe when compared to the patch - based gev approach .",
    "4 .   utilising a mle approach , the location parameter , @xmath141 , can be estimated under idealised circumstances on the percent level for less than @xmath0 patches .",
    "the last point indicates that , from a statistical point of view , the patch - based method can be easily applied to relatively small survey areas , particularly if the focus lies on high-@xmath5 systems .",
    "the gpd approach , however , seems only to be usefully applicable for studies of single objects but not as a cosmological probe . in order to observe the large number of clusters required to get an accurate estimate of @xmath141",
    ", the threshold would have to be substantially lowered and this would violate the assumption on which the gpd is based .",
    "in addition very large survey areas would be required as well , which makes the gev based approach more appealing for a real application of the method .",
