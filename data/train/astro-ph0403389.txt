    "we are interested in understanding how the dynamics of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies determines how the energy and matter released by stars are redistributed . in a previous paper @xcite , hereafter denoted paper  i , we investigated theoretical models of the ionization ratios of li - like absorbers , n5 , o6 , c4 , in the galactic halo .",
    "these ions are believed to form in nonequilibrium in shocks , evaporative interfaces , or rapidly cooling gas , all of which trace the dynamics of the interstellar medium . as a useful new diagnostic , in that paper we focused on _ velocity - resolved _ signatures of several common physical structures : ( 1 ) a cooling galactic fountain flow that rises , cools , and recombines as it returns to the disk ; ( 2 ) shocks moving toward the observer ; ( 3 ) a conductive interface with the observer located in the hotter gas .    in this paper , we present a survey of 34 sightlines observed through the galactic halo by the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) and the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) in the li - like absorption lines of o6 , n5 , and sometimes c4 . we report the integrated column densities of these three ions and their ratios .",
    "we also focus , as in paper  i , on the new , and potentially useful diagnostic provided by the velocity dependence of these ion ratios .",
    "the observable velocity - ionization trends are weak , because even strong trends are washed out by the large thermal width of the gas at different parts of the flow .",
    "additional confusion results since the long sightlines almost definitely pass through multiple structures .",
    "we report an indication of a weak trend of decreasing n()/n( ) at more positive velocities .",
    "the distribution of this slope is broad , with a mean value , @xmath4(r ) @xmath5(sys )  dex  ( km  s-1)-1 , displaced somewhat from zero .    in this paper ,   [ data ] describes the data calibration and analysis .",
    "the basic observational results are described in   [ results ] .",
    "section [ interpretation ] describes models of the dynamical signatures of the li - like ions , and interpretation .",
    "we observe the relative distribution of li - like ions in the interstellar medium using the fuse satellite and the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) and goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) on hst .",
    "the fuse satellite consists of four coaligned rowland circle spectrographs which redundantly cover the spectral range 910 - 1189    at @xmath620,000 resolution @xcite .",
    "the stis instrument offers far - ultraviolet spectroscopy in first - order and echelle modes .",
    "spectroscopic modes used in this study are the g140 m first - order grating ( 55    in the range 1140 - 1740   , @xmath615,000 ) and the e140 m echelle ( 1150 - 1710   , @xmath650,000 ) @xcite .",
    "the ghrs was the precursor uv spectrograph to stis on the hst , and offered similar capabilities without the imaging capability of stis .",
    "data used here were obtained with the g160 m first - order grating @xcite .",
    "the data analysis consists of instrument - dependent calibration , followed by a common continuum and wavelength verification process .",
    "the corrections which are unique to a given bandpass are made ( e.g. , assessment of h@xmath7 contamination which is only relevant to the   band ) , and finally the two or three bandpasses are combined to study the velocity - resolved //  column density ratios .",
    "table [ datasets ] shows the sightlines , with the instrument and dataset name for each ( multi - exposure ) observation , the total ( nighttime for fuse ) exposure time , observation date , the principal investigator , and for hst instruments , the proposal i d number .",
    "all of the fuse data are guaranteed time observations ( gto ) , and the gto project can be identified by the first 3 numbers of the dataset name .",
    "stis and ghrs first - order spectra only cover the  or the  line ; for those datasets the relevant ion is identified in the instrument column of the table . as described below , the ghrs wavelength scale can be improved using auxiliary datasets , and the ones used in this project are also listed .",
    "most fuse data issues are adequately resolved by the fuse data pipeline ( version 1.1 is described in * ? ? ?",
    "* all data used here were re - reduced using version 1.8.7 and spot checked against 2.0.5 ) .",
    "the pipeline screens for basic satellite location and orientation problems  south atlantic anomaly avoidance , earth avoidance , etc .",
    "( see * ? ? ?",
    "particular to fuse are the thermal motions of the grating and telescope with orbital phase and spacecraft orientation with respect to the satellite orbit plane and the sun .",
    "thermally induced grating motion is well understood and removed by the pipeline .",
    "telescope motion is removed in the lif1 channel because the spacecraft points using that optical path .",
    "a point source can move in the large apertures of the second lithium fluoride channel lif2 and both silicon carbide channels sic1 and sic2 , and the spectral resolution and instrument throughput can be degraded .",
    "the detector characteristics are sufficiently different that it is inadvisable to directly combine data from different segments .",
    "therefore , for  , the lif1a segment are used for quantitative measurements , and the lif2b data used for feature confirmation in cases of low signal - to - noise .",
    "the fuse data for each target were obtained from the archive in raw form , re - reduced and combined into single spectrum for each detector segment , with the following steps . a target",
    "may be observed several times , resulting in several _ datasets _ , each consisting of multiple _",
    "exposures_. all exposures were screened for bursts , and the remaining data were recalibrated using the fuse pipeline ( calibrated data was available from the archive but from earlier versions of the pipeline ) .",
    "the pipeline removes the time - dependent spectral motion from the grating motion and the orbital doppler shift , removes detector background , extracts a 1-dimensional spectrum , and provides a flux calibration and wavelength solution .",
    "this recalibration also allows us to select only photons received during spacecraft night .",
    "although not absolutely necessary for analysis of the   line in isolation , there are known artifacts in daytime data . for simplicity in this study ,",
    "only nighttime data were used .",
    "the fuse pipeline wavelength solution at the time of this analysis was questionable , especially in its total offset ( the relative scale is somewhat more trustworthy ) .",
    "for example , the heliocentric - to - lsr conversion was applied with incorrect sign in v1.8.7 .",
    "multiple datasets were cross - correlated to find their relative wavelength offsets before combining , and the absolute wavelength scale was corrected using low - ionization interstellar lines as described below .",
    "several datasets were recalibrated with v2.0.5 , and no significant differences were found in the spectral region considered here , aside from the overall velocity offset , which had been corrected anyway .",
    "stis echelle data suffer from cross - order scatter , which degrades the spectral purity and increases the background in the extracted spectra .",
    "in fact , the standard stis pipeline uses a linear interpolation of the count rate between orders to subtract the background when extracting a one - dimensional spectrum from the two - dimensional image . a better background algorithm , which models the two - dimensional scatter iteratively with the science spectrum , can be included in the stis pipeline .",
    "all stis echelle datasets were recalibrated through the pipeline with this additional algorithm .",
    "the pipeline performs doppler correction , flat and dark fielding , flux calibration , and wavelength solution .",
    "first - order stis data were deemed acceptable in post - pipeline calibrated form from the archive .",
    "all data were recalibrated using the most recent version of the ghrs pipeline and calibration files .",
    "changes especially in the latter make this recalibration preferable to using archived calibrated data . during the recalibration process",
    ", the ghrs wavelength scale was improved using calibration lamp and spybal exposures taken immediately before or after the science exposure .",
    "the pipeline combines substepped exposures , performs flat and dark fielding , and provides flux calibration and a wavelength solution .",
    "much of the data used here were taken as part of surveys for low - redshift ly@xmath8 absorption @xcite .",
    "the basic data reduction steps were repeated here , but following the same procedure described in these papers , to which the reader is referred for further discussion of the data characteristics .",

    "continuum placement is often the dominant error in absorption - line measurements , and it is especially important in the case of broad weak lines such as those expected from interstellar civ , nv , and  .",
    "the continuum in these data was fitted in a region @xmath1720    wide around the line of interest ( the actual width was set by the wavelength coverage of the observation and the desire to omit strong emission features in the background source ) .",
    "the continuum was fitted as a fourth - order polynomial simultaneously with gaussians for all absorption lines in the region . as demonstrated in figure [ continuum ] ,",
    "the inclusion or exclusion of neighboring absorption features to the line of interest , especially weak features , was explored and the variation which this caused in the equivalent width of the line of interest was included in the experimental error .",
    "we also tried different order polynomials in the continuum fit and varied the size of the fitting region .",

    "the h@xmath7 absorption is removed from the absorption where relevant , and the error bars of those points increased accordingly . the strength of the h@xmath7 lines or their upper limits are reported in table [ targets ] .",
    "this process is more precise for the p(3 ) line , as it is not a particularly strong @xmath24=3 line compared to other measurable lines in the bandpass .",
    "the r(4 ) line is one of the stronger @xmath24=4 lines available in the fuse long - wavelength segments , so the error in the column measured from weaker lines is larger .",
    "the r(4 ) line is much weaker than the p(3 ) line , however , and usually does not confuse the analysis .",

    "incorrect subtraction of h@xmath7 in this study is most likely to err towards underestimating the   column , because conservative determinations were made in situations where the h@xmath7 absorption is complex .",
    "the presence of undersubtracted h@xmath7 in the stronger line , at a velocity of @xmath25  km  s-1 relative to  , would decrease any trend of decreasing n(nv)/n( ) , so if there is such a systematic error , the correction of that error would only strengthen the trend .",

    "the column density was measured along each line of sight using other isolated lines in the fuse bandpass .",
    "only upper limits were obtained for this contamination , and no subtraction was performed .",
    "unresolved saturated absorption components can be washed out in an absorption line , leading to an underestimate of the absorbing column density .",
    "this problem has been discussed in detail by various authors including @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the absorption lines of civ  and   can suffer from this effect , especially if these species are present in overionized gas .",
    "( in such cases , the gas is cooler than the temperatures at which these species dominate in collisional ionization equilibrium , so that the thermal widths are smaller or comparable to the fuse resolution of @xmath1715  km  s-1 ) .",
    "absorption features of nv  are less susceptible , owing to the intrinsic weakness of the nv@xmath271240 doublet .",
    "as described in @xcite , unresolved saturated absorption can be detected and corrected for by comparing two absorption lines of different oscillator strengths . in the case of the three doublets in this study ,",
    "the apparent velocity - resolved column density can be compared in the two lines of the doublet , whose strengths differ by a factor of two .",
    "figure [ saturate ] shows the velocity - resolved apparent column density @xmath28 for the sightline that shows most clear evidence of unresolved saturated absorption , eso 141-g55 .",
    "the weaker line of the doublet yields higher apparent column densities @xmath28 than the stronger line , by @xmath150.1 dex ( 0.06@xmath140.15 dex for nv  and 0.1@xmath140.1 dex for civ ) . by the method of @xcite ,",
    "the civ  and nv  total column densities should be corrected by approximately 0.1 dex .",
    "however ,   probably also suffers from unresolved saturated components resulting in a similar correction . in almost all sightlines",
    ", the   1038 line is confused by h@xmath7 and c2 absorption , so the correction can not be reliably made .",
    "no corrections for unresolved saturation are applied to the data in this study , because the variation of column density ratio with velocity is of primary interest , and because the correction for   can not be made in most cases with only a single absorption line .",
    "we explore the effects of unresolved saturated components below , and find it to be small .",
    "figure [ satmodel ] shows the effect of unresolved absorption , in an analysis similar to @xcite ; the optical depth for   at the ( probably unrealistically ) lower limit temperature of 25,000  k is moderately underestimated by being underresolved by fuse . at 10",
    "times lower concentration , nv  is accurately measured . in this worst - case scenario ,",
    "the velocity - resolved column density can be off by quite a bit ( more than the total apparent column density , because of the effects of instrumental smearing ) , but the effect is symmetric across the line .",
    "this effect can not account for the large scatter in observed nv /   ratios ( figure  [ rat - color ] ) .",
    "most sightlines have lower quality data , and more realistic temperatures for the absorbing gas result in column density ratio corrections that , if they could be calculated for  , would be within the error bars .",
    "@xcite estimate that , for a set of sightlines that includes this one , fewer than 20% of the sightlines should require saturation correction in  , and the correction would be less than 0.1  dex in those cases .    in the context of velocity - resolved data",
    ", it is more interesting to investigate the effect of saturation and instrumental smoothing on the observed line ratio .",
    "the fourth panel of figure  [ satmodel ] shows that for symmetric line profiles , this effect will decrease any trend of ion ratio as a function of velocity or wavelength .",
    "if the line profile is not symmetric , then saturation and instrumental smearing can affect the stronger   line more than the nv  line , resulting in a small gradient in the observed ion ratio which is not present in the true ratio .",
    "figure  [ sat3 ] illustrates this effect ; we model a line with a sawtooth shape in @xmath29 , with typical   and nv  column densities per km  s-1 ( see table  [ averages ] ) .",
    "smearing has a small effect on the measured column , as seen in the top two panels , but the effect is similar between nv  and   lines .",
    "the observed line ratio in the lower left panel shows a gradient not present in the true column density distribution , but that gradient is only @xmath17 - 0.0001  dex  ( km  s-1)-1 , smaller than the gradient measured in many of the sightlines in this study .",
    "visual inspection of the data shows that @xmath171/3 of the sightlines have an asymmetric   line profile with more column at more positive velocities , which in combination with instrumental smearing , could produce a small negative slope in the observed nv /   ratio . as for symmetric lines",
    ", the lower right panel shows that asymmetric lines offset in velocity also cause gradients in the line ratio , and that instrumental smearing can decrease that gradient . in conclusion , the reader should be aware of this effect in velocity - resolved data , but we do not feel that it produces the entire trend seen in this dataset .",
    "a potentially critical systematic effect is the wavelength or velocity calibration , since we combine data from different instruments .",
    "the fuse wavelength calibration in older versions of the data pipeline in particular was uncertain at the 510  km  s-1 level .",
    "however , the alignment of low - ionization interstellar absorption lines with h1 21  cm emission can be used to correct the wavelength solution , at least in the neighborhood of the li - like ions .",
    "the wavelength offset for all data was corrected in the same way .",
    "the wavelength offset was measured in low - ionization , narrow interstellar absorption lines expected to be present predominantly in neutral atomic gas : , o1 , c2 , , , n1 , and s2 .",
    "these were aligned with the lsr velocity of the neutral hydrogen emission measured in the 21  cm line , either with the leiden - dwingeloo survey @xcite or the parkes multibeam survey @xcite .",
    "we found the accuracy of this standard method of absolute wavelength calibration to be @xmath15510  km  s-1 .",
    "@xcite made extensive tests of this calibration and found a similar accuracy .",
    "they also noted that version 1.8.7 of the fuse pipeline led to a 10  km  s-1 offset between   1032 and   1038 .",
    "further investigation by scientists involved with fuse pipeline development ( kruk & sembach 2002 , private communication ) found that the earlier software did indeed introduce a stretch in the wavelength scale corresponding to 8  km  s-1 over the range spanned by the low - ionization lines used ( post - pipeline ) to correct the wavelength .",
    "( there was also an incorrect minus sign in the conversion from spacecraft to lsr velocity . ) the correction as applied here did take into account that wavelength `` stretch '' when data quality allowed it to be measured .",
    "further , several sample sightlines were re - reduced using version 2.0.5 of the fuse pipeline , which has improved the `` stretch '' and wavelength calibration issues ; no significantly different offsets between   and nv  were discovered .",
    "although these tests show no evidence of systematic wavelength calibration issues , we estimate the maximum systematic effect ( due to remaining issues in the new pipeline or perverseness of the data ) to be 5  km  s-1 , which would introduce an n5/o6 slope of 0.0014  dex  ( km  s-1)-1 , less than half of the mean effect seen in figure  [ histo - slope ] .",
    "thus , we believe it unlikely that the entire trend seen here is due to systematic problems in the fuse calibration process , though we can only rule this out with 80% confidence .",
    "( there is a 20% chance that so many of our ion slopes would be negative if the true mean slope in the galactic halo was zero . )",
    "the li - like ions civ , nv , and   are produced in nonequilibrium physical situations , such as shocks , conductive interfaces and rapidly cooling gas ( paper  i ) .",
    "the different ions are generally produced at different flow velocities in the structure , so a viewer looking through such a structure will see trends in the ion column density ratios as a function of line - of - sight velocity .",
    "the ratio - velocity signature in all possibly relevant physical situations must be considered to properly interpret trends in the data .",
    "trends in the column density ratios , and those ratios as a function of line - of - sight velocity , could also reflect differences in the spatial distributions of the different ions in the galactic halo . in the following sections we interpret our dataset in terms of the large - scale distribution of hot gas in the halo .",
    "we attempt ( unsuccessfully ) to model the observed trends in ion ratio with such a purely _ kinematic _ model , as opposed to the more physical models ( shocks , conductive interfaces , etc ) discussed in paper  i.      as a reasonable starting point , one can imagine a smooth halo of ionized gas distributed in an exponential distribution in galactic altitude , corotating on cylinders with the disk gas , without postulating a physical mechanism for producing this distribution .",
    "a smooth density distribution requires fewer assumptions than a patchy or clumpy one .",
    "there is observational evidence of such patchiness ( for example the scatter in total column density and column density ratio found in this study , and the extensive investigation of @xcite showing large variations in   towards the magellanic clouds ) , but a smoothly distributed model may capture the averaged global characteristics of the gas . as for the second assumption ,",
    "a rotation rate independent of galactic altitude is the simplest starting point , although observational evidence for such corotation is ambiguous .",
    "for example , @xcite argue that civ  corotates with the disk up to galactic altitudes @xmath30 5  kpc , based on the lack of strong secondary absorption peaks .",
    "this is a well - known phenomenon in which strong velocity gradients along the line of sight can create discrete features in an absorption spectrum .",
    "these look like density enhancements , even if the true space density of the gas is smooth or constant .",
    "it it not clear that the lack of secondary features can be used in this manner to argue for corotating gas , or at least a small velocity gradient , if the halo gas distribution is extremely patchy .",
    "it is notable that there is significant civ  absorption visible in their figures outside of the velocity range allowed by corotation , and that there is somewhat more of this gas at negative than positive velocities .",
    "( the authors also note that 7/9 sightlines show negative civ  velocities , with similar results for nv ) .",
    "significant forbidden - velocity gas was also detected near the galactic center by @xcite .",
    "even a fairly smooth halo in a rising fountain flow may not corotate with the disk ; @xcite notes that the rotation speed decreases with altitude , mostly because the radial gradient in the galactic gravitational potential decreases with altitude .    despite the probable incompleteness of this model , it is instructive both to attempt to determine the scale height of the hot gas , and to model the ion - ratio signature that such a structure would have in velocity space .",
    "the scale height of the halo gas can be determined by fitting @xmath31 versus galactic altitude @xmath32 ( * ? ? ? * for nv , civ , and ) .",
    "one obtains a scale height and midplane density from the fit . naturally , when only extragalactic targets are observed , one takes the mean @xmath31 and divides by a given midplane density to obtain the scale height , instead of obtaining the midplane density directly from the data .",
    "figure [ scaleht ] shows @xmath31 for nv  and  and the derived scale heights using midplane densities of @xmath33=1.7@xmath1610 - 8  cm-3 @xcite for   and @xmath33=2.6@xmath1610 - 9  cm-3 @xcite for nv .",
    "the scale heights agree with previous work , confirming that the vertical extent of gas increases with decreasing ionization stage , from   to nv  to civ  to .",
    "such trends were predicted by @xcite .",
    "the large variations in @xmath31 result from the extreme patchiness of the gas in even large scales .",
    "@xcite used a patchiness parameter in their fits to the scale height , and found that almost all of the scatter is from intrinsic patchiness rather than observational random error .",
    "this is further confirmed by @xcite , who saw a hint that the distribution can not be fitted by a plane - parallel structure ( or that there is large variation above different parts of the galactic disk ) , and by @xcite , in which patchiness is the clear cause of the data being consistent with scale heights 25 kpc .",
    "the extreme patchiness of interstellar hot gas is also confirmed by measurement of   emission ",
    "the ratio of emission ( proportional to @xmath34 ) to absorption ( proportional to @xmath35 ) gives the space density @xmath35 , and shows that the gas is contained in small , dense structures , not a diffuse smooth distribution @xcite .",
    "this is expected since this gas is commonly produced in thin interfaces or highly disturbed cooling gas .",
    "if one assumes that the hot halo gas corotates on cylinders with the disk , line - of - sight velocity can be mapped onto galactic altitude @xmath32 and galactocentric radius @xmath36 .",
    "this mapping does not reveal any trend of ion column density ratio with @xmath32 in this dataset .",
    "this does not rule out a change in ionization as a function of galactic altitude .",
    "it merely demonstrates that a simple mapping based on smoothly distributed gas corotating on cylinders above the disk is of limited use at high latitudes .",
    "similarly , there is no clear trend in ion column density ratio as a function of implied galactocentric radius @xmath36 .",
    "this is even less surprising , as the sample here consists of mostly high - latitude sightlines .",
    "it is known that there is a gradient in galactic metallicity , with a factor of 10 drop from galactic center to the outer galaxy , resulting from the gradient in star formation activity .",
    "there are suggestions , but no incontrovertible evidence , that the gradient might be steeper for nitrogen ( @xmath37 dex  kpc-1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or carbon @xcite than for oxygen ( @xmath38 dex  kpc-1 , * ? ? ?",
    "the dataset presented here may show hints of decreasing n(civ)/n( ) at larger @xmath36 , consistent with a steeper gradient of carbon than oxygen , but the trend is not statistically significant .",
    "( the mean n(civ)/n( ) decreases by less than 0.2 dex from @xmath36 of 5 to 100 kpc while the variation along and between lines of sight is an order of magnitude ) .",
    "even if this trend exists , it could indicate a change in ionization and not metallicity as a function of @xmath36 . in this dataset , it is probably an artifact of trying to extract information from high - latitude sightlines with weak assumptions about corotation .",
    "mapping the data to galactic altitude using corotation on cylinders is questionable and does not produce illuminating plots .",
    "it is more instructive to model what the velocity - ionization signature of a smoothly corotating halo would be , to better understand what observations could show .",
    "figure [ smooth ] shows the modeled trend in log[n(nv)/n( ) ] as a function of line - of - sight velocity for sightlines at @xmath21=+40@xmath39  through a smooth , corotating halo in which the scale height of nv  is larger than (  [ height ] , * ? ? ?",

    "the thickness of the line scales with the density of nv  and   at that point along the line of sight .",
    "this figure also shows the distribution of sightlines in this study .",
    "there is an excess of sightlines in the northern sky near @xmath40120@xmath39 , and this direction would display decreasing n(nv)/n( ) at more positive velocities in such a smooth halo .",
    "it should be recalled that these sightlines also pass through hvc complex c , and might be expected to have special characteristics for that reason .",
    "however , no difference was detected in the column density ratio along these sightlines compared to the general sample ( figure [ lbslopes ] ) .",

    "there is no correlation between the observed and predicted slopes .",
    "@xcite explore the possibility of fitting high velocity with a corotating halo model and find that the data do not support ( but also do not rule out ) such an arrangement .",
    "we consider the diagnostic power of velocity - resolved column density ratios in understanding the galactic halo",
    ". column density ratios of li - like ions in the galaxy are useful to diagnose the physical formation mechanism of the gas and to study the interstellar gas cycle , and a survey of these ions can reveal general trends .",
    "we find , in a survey of sightlines observed with fuse and hst , that the distribution of n(nv ) and n( ) in the halo does not appear to favor a dominant physical production mechanism .",
    "we find a possible weak trend of decreasing n(nv)/n( ) at more positive velocities ( @xmath430.0032@xmath140.0022(r)@xmath140.0014(sys )  dex  ( km  s-1)-1 , figure [ histo - slope ] ) .",
    "the weakness of this trend also argues against halo sightlines dominated by a single structure , e.g. the local bubble interface .    in paper",

    "observable velocity - ionization trends are weak , because even very strong trends are washed out by the large thermal width of the gas at different parts of the flow . additional confusion results because the long sightlines almost definitely pass through multiple structures .",
    "in fact , the dispersion of n(nv)/n( ) , both integrated and velocity - resolved , clearly indicates that no single production scenario known to date can completely explain the galactic halo .",
