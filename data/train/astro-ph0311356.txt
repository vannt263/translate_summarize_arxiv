    "due to its large intrinsic luminosity , an agn ( active galactic nucleus ) can be observed up to very high redshifts , and agns can therefore be used to probe the early epochs of the universe when the formation of large structures began .",
    "recent observations have found a considerable number of quasars at high redshift @xcite , with some of them at redshift @xmath3 @xcite , when the universe was about 1 gyr old .    while agns were first noticed to be a class of objects worthy of detailed follow - up in other bands on the basis of their radio emission , e.g. @xcite , more recent work has focused on surveys at shorter wavelengths . due to their low spatial density , most agns at high redshift ( defined here to be @xmath4 ) were discovered by large area , shallow optical surveys .",
    "an example of this is the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) , which in its first data release @xcite presented 238 high redshift quasars",
    ". however , these quasars were selected based on their optical properties , and optical surveys are subject to bias against the discovery of quasars which are either intrinsically dim at these wavelengths or are obscured by dust like the type 2 agn that are believed to comprise most of the agn background @xcite .",
    "the other main agn selection technique is x - ray detection , as x - ray emission appears to be a universal characteristic of agns at all observed redshifts @xcite .",
    "however , given the relative faintness of the majority of the sources , x - ray surveys need to rely on optical spectroscopy for most of the identifications . with new x - ray missions like the chandra x - ray observatory and its superb angular resolution ,",
    "the identification of x - ray sources at other wavelengths has become much easier , allowing for successful multiwavelength follow - up of x - ray sources .",
    "the nature of the x - ray emission also ensures that the optical selection bias due to obscuration is strongly reduced ( although the x - ray selection may introduce other biases ) .",
    "this is especially true at high redshift , where the observed x - ray photons were emitted at higher energies and can penetrate even considerable amounts of obscuring material .",
    "according to a recent review by @xcite only seven of the high redshift agns known were discovered by their x - ray emission .",
    "three of them were found with rosat @xcite , while the other four were detected by chandra @xcite .",
    "one of them was detected in the radio and classified as radio loud @xcite . in this paper , we present the discovery of the eighth high redshift x - ray selected agn , and the second discovered by the calan yale deep extragalactic research ( cyder ) survey , at a redshift @xmath0 . the cyder survey is a collaborative effort between universidad de chile and yale university to study faint stellar and extragalactic populations in detail .",
    "one of the key aims is the characterization of the population of faint x - ray sources . in order to do this ,",
    "some of the fields of the survey were selected to overlap with moderately deep ( @xmath5 50 ks ) chandra pointings .",
    "multiwavelength follow - up in these fields includes optical imaging using the ctio 4 m telescope , near ir images obtained using the dupont telescope at las campanas observatory ( lco ) and optical spectroscopy from vlt at cerro paranal and magellan at lco .",
    "a more complete review of the optical and spectroscopic properties of the x - ray sources in the first two fields can be found in @xcite .    in  2",
    "we describe the x - ray , optical and near - ir observations that led to the discovery of the agn presented here . in  3 we discuss its observed properties and compare it with other high redshift quasars , both optical and x - ray selected .",
    "we present our conclusions in  4 . throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath6 km s @xmath7 mpc@xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "these cosmological parameters are consistent with the recent findings by @xcite .",
    "we define the photon index @xmath10 as the exponent giving a photon flux density x - ray spectrum @xmath11 in photons @xmath12 s@xmath7 kev@xmath7 .",
    "as part of the cyder survey , five fields observed by chandra and currently available in the archive were downloaded and analyzed using standard techniques with the ciao package . in this paper",
    "we discuss the results for the source cxocy j033716.7 - 050153 found in the sbs 0335 - 05 field .",
    "this field was observed by chandra on september 7th , 2000 for 60.51 ks ( pi : thuan ) and retrieved from the archive by our group .",
    "a detailed analysis of the whole sample of x - ray sources detected in these fields will be presented in @xcite .",
    "reduction of the data included the removal of bad columns and pixels using the guidelines specified on the `` acis recipes : clean the data '' web page and the removal of flaring pixels using the flagflare routine .",
    "we used the full set of standard event grades ( 0,2,3,4,6 ) and created two images , one from 0.5 to 2.0 kev and one from 2.0 to 8.0 kev .",
    "then , we used the wavdetect routine from the ciao package to identify the point sources within these images , checking wavelet scales 1,2,4,8 and 16 .",
    "cxocy j033716.7 - 050153 was detected in the i2 acis ccd .",
    "we extract an x - ray spectrum using a minimum of 5 counts per channel from 0.5 to 3.5 kev ( i.e. the 20 lowest energy photons ) , using the psextract script .",
    "we then fitted the spectrum within xspec 11.0 , with a power law model and absorption constrained to the galactic value of @xmath13 from the @xmath14 tool .",
    "this is relatively unconstraining , yielding a spectral index of @xmath15 , and observed fluxes of @xmath16 ergs / sec/@xmath17 and @xmath18 ergs / sec/@xmath17 , from 0.5 - 2 and 0.5 - 8 kev , respectively .",
    "the fit to the x - ray spectrum did not depend on whether the @xmath19 or the c - statistic was used , so it is unlikely that large errors were induced by fitting with an insufficient number of photons per bin .",
    "the unabsorbed fluxes are approximately @xmath20 and @xmath21 ergs / sec/@xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the errors should be about 30% due to the statistical error in the count rate and the uncertainties in the best - fitting spectral models .",
    "the cumulative histogram of detected x - ray photons is presented on figure 1 .",
    "the field of the agn was observed with the ctio 4 meter blanco telescope , using the mosaic - ii camera , that provides a field of view of 36@xmath22x36@xmath22 .",
    "images were taken using the @xmath23,@xmath24,@xmath25 and @xmath26 filters on the nights of october 8th and 10th , 2002 , centered on the chandra archival image central coordinates .",
    "exposure times were 2 hours under 1.3@xmath27 seeing conditions in the @xmath23 filter , 50 minutes under 1.1@xmath27 seeing in @xmath24 , 50 minutes under 1.1@xmath27 seeing in @xmath25 and 20 minutes under 1.0@xmath27 seeing in @xmath26 .",
    "a second image in the @xmath26 band was taken with the ut4 vlt telescope at cerro paranal , chile using the fors2 instrument .",
    "this image was taken on the night of september 19 2003 in service mode .",
    "total exposure time was 14 minutes under 0.7@xmath27 seeing conditions .",
    "images were reduced using standard techniques with the iraf / mscred package .",
    "identification of the optical counterpart of the x - ray source was straightforward given the superb spatial resolution of the chandra observatory .",
    "indeed , only one optical source can be found in a 3@xmath27 circle around the x - ray emission centroid .",
    "the offset between the x - ray and optical positions was @xmath28 in ra and @xmath29 in dec . in order to calculate the received flux in each band , we performed aperture photometry using an aperture of @xmath30fwhm of each image , centered on the centroid of the @xmath25 band source , the band in which the signal to noise is highest .",
    "the observed magnitudes in each band can be found in table 1 .",
    "figure 2 shows the optical finding chart , based on the @xmath25 band image .",
    "multislit spectroscopy of x - ray sources detected by chandra in the field of the agn was obtained at las campanas observatory with the magellan i ( baade ) telescope , using the ldss-2 instrument .",
    "the observations were taken on the night of october 4th , 2002 .",
    "the field of the high redshift agn cxocy j033716.7 - 050153 was observed for 2 hours in 0.75@xmath27 seeing conditions .",
    "the med / blue grism was used , giving a dispersion of 5.3   per pixel at a central wavelength of 5500 .",
    "the obtained spectrum was reduced using standard iraf tasks called by a customized version of the bogus codestern / homepage / bogus.html ] .we calibrated the wavelength of the spectrum using the he - ar comparison lamp and the night sky lines .",
    "rough flux calibration of the spectrum was performed using the spectrum of the ltt9239 spectrophotometric standard .",
    "figure 3 shows the final , reduced spectrum together with the mean spectrum of quasars at @xmath4 observed by the sdss .",
    "ly@xmath31 and nv are clearly distinguishable in the spectrum .",
    "the measured redshift using these emission lines is @xmath32 .",
    "with an absolute magnitude of @xmath33 ( vega ) , calculated extrapolating the @xmath26 band magnitude using the sdss qso composite spectrum @xcite , cxocy j033716.7 - 050153 is a faint agn .",
    "indeed , there are only two agns known at high redshift that are fainter in the optical , vla j1236 + 6213 at @xmath34 @xcite and cxohdfn j123719.0 + 621025 at @xmath35 @xcite , both located in the hdf - n / cdf - n . in x - rays , this quasar shows a luminosity in the [ 0.5 - 2.0 ] kev band of @xmath36 ergs s@xmath7 .",
    "this is a large x - ray luminosity for an agn that is faint in the optical bands . in order to quantify this statement",
    ", we can calculate the effective optical to x - ray power - law spectral slope which is given by @xmath37}{\\log [ \\nu ( 2\\textnormal { kev})/\\nu ( 2500\\textnormal { \\aa})]}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the flux density per unit of frequency and @xmath39 is the frequency of the given wavelength or energy . for this agn",
    ", we measure a value of @xmath40 .",
    "the average value for the known sample of @xmath4 agns detected in x - rays is @xmath41 from a total of 71 sources , so this new agn is a @xmath42 deviation . with the data available",
    "now we can not calculate the contribution from the host galaxy to the optical luminosity , but it can only be significant if its luminosity is @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore , a significant contribution from the host galaxy will only make the optical luminosity of the agn to be smaller , therefore increasing the value of @xmath44 and making the deviation from a typical agn at this redshift to be even larger .",
    "a plot of @xmath44 as a function of redshift for all the high redshift agns detected in x - rays can be found in figure 4 and the @xmath45 relation for these objects is presented in figure 5 . in figure 4",
    "we can see that the x - ray selected sources have systematically higher values of @xmath44 than optically selected agns .",
    "this correlation is expected from selection effects ; however , it should be noted that the optical luminosities of all the x - ray selected sources are fainter than that of the least luminous optically - selected quasar ( with the exception of the one x - ray selected blazar ) , see figure 5 .",
    "recents results presented by @xcite show that there is a good correlation between the uv flux characterized by the flux density at 2500   and the soft x - ray flux measured at 2 kev .",
    "this correlation can be expressed as @xmath46 .",
    "a similar result was reported in @xcite , in this case @xmath47 .",
    "this relation implies that @xmath44 should also be correlated with the uv flux ( or luminosity ) .",
    "figure 5 shows that optically selected agns are more luminous , both in the optical and the x - ray , than the x - ray selected ones . the @xmath44 value of optically selected agn are therefore expected to be lower as can be seen in figure 4 .    in figure 5",
    ", we can also see that without correcting for the possible optical obscuration cxocy j033716.7 - 050153 is a significant deviant from the @xmath48 relation .",
    "there are two possible explanations for this deviation : either there is significant obscuration of the optical light by dust or this a radio loud agn with @xmath44 enhanced by a second component , probably coronal , contributing to the x - ray emission . strong optical variability can be ruled out using the two optical observations separated by @xmath49 year in the observed frame , in which the @xmath26 band magnitude remained almost unchanged given the error bars .    if this agn is relatively unobscured , then its anomalous value of @xmath44 , as well is its relative optical faintess compared with other high redshift agn may be explained if the source is at the bright end of the low luminosity agn ( llagn ) category .",
    "such sources are typically seen to have x - ray luminosities below about 1% of the eddington limit , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the mass of the central black hole would then have to be at least about @xmath50 .",
    "applying the black hole fundamental plane relation from @xcite , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the radio luminosity at 5 ghz , @xmath53 is the 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosity and m is the mass of the black hole in units of @xmath54 , we find that the radio power is expected to be at least @xmath55jy . now , if we assume instead that this is a typical agn radiating at about 10% of its eddington luminosity then using the merloni relation we get a radio flux of @xmath56jy .",
    "moreover it seems that the radio emission is quenched in agn accreting at about 10% of the eddington rate @xcite , so an even lower radio flux would be expected .    following the standard definition of radio to optical flux ratio @xmath57 given by @xcite , where optical flux is defined as the flux at 4400   in the rest frame and radio flux",
    "is calculated at a rest frame frequency of 5 ghz ( 6 cm ) , radio loud sources have @xmath57 values in the range 10 - 1000 , while for radio quiet agns 0.1@xmath581 . with the assumption that the eddington ratio is 1% for this agn we get that @xmath59 , making it a radio loud agn .",
    "however , given the low optical luminosity , we can not neglect the contribution of star light from the host galaxy , in which case the value of @xmath57 computed is simply the lower limit of the radio to optical flux ratio for the agn emission alone . assuming an eddington ratio of 10% then @xmath60 , which makes it a radio quiet agn .    according to an alternate definition of radio loudness often used for high redshift quasars @xcite , to be considered radio loud",
    "an agn has to have a minimum 1.4 ghz specific luminosity of @xmath61 ergs s@xmath7 hz@xmath7 @xcite , which at @xmath0 corresponds to a specific flux of @xmath62 mjy , very close to the detection limit of the vla first survey .",
    "unfortunately , the field of cxocy j033716.7 - 050153 was not observed by the first survey . using the nvss survey @xcite catalog",
    ", there were no detectable sources within a 1 arcminute radius .",
    "considering that the completeness limit is 2.5 mjy , we can use this as an upper limit to the 1.4 ghz continuum emission . then",
    ", this agn could be at most marginally classified as radio loud .    in order to determine the amount of obscuration affecting the optical spectrum of this agn we can compare its optical colors with a typical agn spectrum at this redshift .",
    "the optical colors of this agn are : @xmath63 and @xmath64 . using the composite sdss qso spectrum @xcite and redshifting it to @xmath0 we",
    "obtain the following colors : @xmath65 and @xmath66 accounting for the igm absorption using the description given in @xcite .",
    "if instead we use an average of all sdss qsos at @xmath4 the results are very similar , finding differences @xmath67 . the fact that cxocy j033716.7 - 050153 is slightly redder than the average qso at that redshift suggests that the optical spectrum is subject to some obscuration in the line of sight . in order to investigate this hypothesis , we added dust obscuration to the average spectrum following the prescription given in @xcite .",
    "given that the observed @xmath25 band flux is affected by the ly@xmath31 emission line , whose strength is highly variable from agn to agn , we will base our reddening estimate only on the @xmath68 color . if order to obtain a @xmath68 color of 2.1 for the redshifted composite sdss quasar , similar to the observed value we need to add an extinction contribution of @xmath69 in the rest frame .",
    "therefore , we will adopt this value to correct the observed optical fluxes for intrinsic dust extinction .",
    "it is also worth noting that the accretion disk may become cooler at lower luminosities , which would also yield redder colors .    another typical way to calculate the amount of obscuration in the line of sight is using the x - ray spectrum . in this case",
    ", however , we do not have enough counts in the x - ray spectrum to calculate absorption directly .",
    "also , since the observed soft x - ray band [ 0.5 - 2.0 ] kev translates into [ 2.8 - 11.22 ] kev in the rest frame , the observed x - ray spectrum is insensitive to moderate amounts of neutral hydrogen absorption ( @xmath70 @xmath12 ) . using the standard dust to gas ratio , we can convert the optical extinction to a neutral hydrogen column density , given by @xmath71 @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "then , we obtain in this case that @xmath72 @xmath12 , implying that the x - ray spectrum is not affected by absorption in the observed energy range .",
    "now , correcting for the optical obscuration we compute an unobscured @xmath26 magnitude of 22.52@xmath73 . using this value",
    ", we calculate the unobscured optical to x - ray power law slope @xmath74 , which is now similar to the average value found for high redshift agn .",
    "as we can see in figure 5 and already presented in @xcite , @xmath75 is a better fit to the data if the low uv luminosity x - ray selected agns are included .",
    "the values for cxocy j033716.7 - 050153 are consistent with this correlation if optical obscuration is taken into account .",
    "we present the discovery of the cxocy j033716.7 - 050153 , the second high redshift x - ray selected agn discovered by the cyder survey .",
    "this is a faint object in the optical .",
    "in fact there are only two agns fainter at these high redshifts .",
    "the x - ray flux relative to its optical emission is unusual , having a larger value of @xmath44 than the typical agn at high redshift .",
    "there are two effects that could bring this object into better accordance with the observed correlations for the general high redshift population :    the first possibility is that this is a radio loud low luminosity agn with a black hole of @xmath76 , emitting at @xmath77 of its eddington luminosity . in this case",
    "the accretion disk is cooler than a typical agn at high redshift , making the optical colors look redder . also , the high value of @xmath44 , even taking into account the correlation with optical luminosity , can be explained by the presence of second emission component , probably coronal , which contributes to the x - ray flux measurement .",
    "a second possibility is that this is a radio quiet agn emitting at an eddington ratio of @xmath78 , in which the optical emisssion is obscured by a moderate amount of dust which would imply a neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath79 @xmath12 , causing the observed optical colors to be redder than the normal agn .",
    "if this is the case , the observed value of @xmath44 is affected by the obscuration of the optical light , and after correcting for it , the corrected value agrees very well with the measurements for other high redshift agns , including the observed correlation between @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "detection of a flat radio spectrum in this source above about 10 @xmath82jy would confirm the low luminosity agn hypothesis , while a non - detection in the radio with a sensitivity limit of a few @xmath82jy would strongly support the radio quiet , mildly obscured agn hypothesis .",
