    "nevertheless , there are lessons to be learned here that will be useful in the next section .",
    "@xmath15particle accelerators have large turning radii of the order of kilometers so that charged orbiting particles can have low acceleration and energy loss from bremsstrahlung is therefore minimized . from the point of view of the formalism developed in this paper , this has the unfortunate implication that meson bremsstrahlung is strongly suppressed . to test our ideas we shall now turn to the ultraperipheral high - energy collision ( upc ) of two heavy ions . in an upc",
    "the two ions interact electromagnetically rather than hadronically , requiring that the impact parameter @xmath128 . after colliding and producing a @xmath129  the colliding nuclei can remain in the ground state , or perhaps transit to an excited state . for either case ,",
    "the star collaboration has recently measured @xmath129 and direct @xmath130 production in au - au collisions at @xmath131/nucleon collisions at rhic@xcite .",
    "upcs are part of the heavy ion program at alice , atlas , and cms at cern . for a review ,",
    "the reader is referred to refs@xcite,@xcite .    in the normal qcd analysis ,",
    "the colliding nuclei in a upc are the source of an intense pulse of photons , the equivalent photon flux being determined from the fourier transform of the electromagnetic field of the moving charges .",
    "these photons produce various mesons from elementary photon - photon and photon - pomeron vertices . rather than individual nucleons",
    ", the entire nucleus produces the photon and pomeron flux , i.e. the nucleons act coherently and cooperatively without betraying the internal nuclear structure .",
    "our picture of meson production will be apparently very different , but in fact it will be fairly similar .",
    "each nucleus is the means for providing acceleration to the other through coulomb repulsion .",
    "moreover , since the entire nucleus turns without breaking up or excitation , it can be considered as a point particle . because the `` turning radii '' are over nuclear length scales rather than the macroscopic scales , the accelerations can be sufficiently large to cause copious meson emission .",
    "consider , therefore , two identical ultrarelativistic point charges moving towards each other and then scattering through a small angle @xmath132 . both have charge @xmath133 mass @xmath134 and four - velocities v@xmath135and v@xmath136 .",
    "the transverse separation between the charges ( impact parameter ) is @xmath137 the classical trajectory for non - relativistic charges is , of course , hyperbolic .",
    "this undergoes modification in the relativistic case .",
    "however , even for non - releativistic motion , the integrals needed for calculating the @xmath36-space current are formidably difficult .",
    "we shall , therefore , use a caricature of the actual classical path by demanding that the charges collide at proper time @xmath138 after which they suddenly change their ( constant ) four - velocities from v@xmath135 and v@xmath139  to v@xmath140and v@xmath141 respectively , @xmath142 the current in fourier space follows from eq.[cur],@xmath143 only the square of the 3-vector @xmath144 needs to be computed .",
    "this has direct terms corresponding to vector meson emission from each nucleus separately , as well as an interference term corresponding to simultaneous emission from both nuclei,@xmath145 with @xmath146and @xmath147denoting unit vectors as usual , we now make a definite choice of velocity vectors : @xmath148 @xmath149for ultrarelativistic nuclei , @xmath150 as before,@xmath151 with @xmath152 and @xmath153 .  for an upc ,",
    "the nuclei undergo scattering through very small angles only . with @xmath154",
    "a compact form results for @xmath155 the direct term is,@xmath156 and the interference term is,@xmath157 expressed in terms of the rapidity variable @xmath158,@xmath159@xmath160    from eq.[j ] or the subsequent results , we see that @xmath161 and hence the total crossection is logarithmically divergent at the upper momentum limit .",
    "this is a consequence of the discontinuous change in the velocity ; a continuous hyperbolic path would not suffer from this problem .",
    "indeed , we can see that the circular motion case would lead to finite crossections .",
    "the scattering angle @xmath132 is determined by the impact parameter @xmath162 , as can be seen from a simple calculation using the retarded electric field of a relativistic charge that passes by a second similar charge@xcite . assuming that neither trajectory deviates appreciably from a straight line , the transverse momentum impulse is , @xmath163 and hence the scattering angle is,@xmath164 the kinetic energy of the non - relativistic transverse motion is,@xmath165 which , for small enough @xmath162 , could provide sufficient energy for particle production .",
    "the crossection for meson production is easily computed because , having started from the premise that there is no back - reaction on the emitting source , it is clear that there are no complicated phase space factors .",
    "this limits the validity of our approach to low meson momenta .",
    "in fact , application to pion production would be more justifiable than to vector meson production .",
    "however , as we shall soon see , there seems to be fair agreement with data even for @xmath129 production .    since @xmath166  i.e. the coupling of vector mesons to the source , is unknown , it is sufficient to write proportionality relations . as a first step , note that the number of nuclei scattered per unit time ( v@xmath167 ) around angle @xmath132  is , @xmath168 this is identical to the rutherford ( or mott ) crossection behaviour in the forward direction .",
    "multiplication by the emission probability yields,@xmath169 integrating over @xmath132 or , equivalently , over @xmath170 yields the crossection in the rapidity variable @xmath158 and the transverse momentum @xmath171,@xmath172 an easy integration gives ,    @xmath173{c}% \\left [   \\cosh2y+\\frac{k_{\\perp}^{2}}{m_{p}^{2}}(\\cosh4y+\\cosh2y)\\right ] \\\\ \\times\\log\\frac{b_{\\max}}{b_{\\min}}-\\operatorname{ci}(k_{\\perp}b_{\\max } ) + \\operatorname{ci}(k_{\\perp}b_{\\min } ) \\end{array } \\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath174 is the standard cosine integral .",
    "the lower limit , @xmath175 @xmath176 corresponds to the nuclei just touching each other , while the upper limit is determined by requiring that the scattering be sufficiently hard so as to produce at least one meson , @xmath177the values of @xmath178  ( see eq.[beta])decrease steadily with @xmath93 : @xmath179 @xmath180 @xmath181 showing that higher resonances will be produced in lesser amounts .        in fig.1",
    "the crossection , arbitrarily normalized , is plotted for @xmath129 production in au - au upcs as a function of transverse momentum for @xmath182 and compared against an existing calculation based on photon - pomeron fusion @xcite .",
    "also shown are data points from the star collaboration@xcite for the number of @xmath129 counts , binned in 25 mev intervals . since @xmath183 is not known , absolute magnitudes can not be predicted in the ads model .",
    "however , the shape of the momentum distribution is not dissimilar from either experiment or conventional theory .",
    "the interference term is crucial , as was found earlier in ref @xcite .    in summary , we have calculated the quantum fluctuations induced in the 5-d bulk when a point source coupled to vector fields in 4-d space - time is transported along a classical trajectory .",
    "the quantum fluctuations amount to the production of different mesons with different momenta in 4-d .",
    "meson crossections are calculable as a function of the point source s motion . in principle",
    ", the motion of a heavy nucleus in an accelerator could lead to the emission of massive particles similar to photon bremsstrahlung but , in practice , the rate is extremely small unless the nuclei have extremely large gamma - factors . on the other hand , for the ultraperipheral collisions of heavy ions ,",
    "the rates are appreciable .",
    "the ads formalism allows for the prediction of the transverse momentum spectrum .",
    "the comparison with existing conventional calculations is fairly satisfactory , and broad features of the existing data are reproduced reasonably well .",
    "emission rates for various excited meson states can be predicted with no additional parameters .",
