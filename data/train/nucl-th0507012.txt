    "since the conjecture of witten [ 1 ] that strange quark matter(sqm ) , would be more stable than the normal nuclear matter , much theoretical effort has been made on the investigation of its properties and applications [ 2 - 13 ] .",
    "because of the well - known difficulty of qcd in the non - perturbative domain , many effective models reflecting the characteristics of the strong interaction are used to study the sqm .",
    "they include the mit bag model [ 2 - 4 ] , the quark - meson coupling(qmc ) model [ 5 ] , the friedberg - lee(fl ) soliton bag model [ 6 ] , the chiral su(3 ) quark model [ 7 ] , the quark mass density - dependent(qmdd ) model [ 8 - 11 ] and the quark mass density- and temperature- dependent model [ 12 , 13 ] , etc . in this paper",
    ", we will focus our attention on the qmdd model .",
    "the qmdd model was first suggested by g. n. fowler , s. raha , and r. m. weiner . according to this model ,",
    "the masses of @xmath1 quarks and strange quarks ( and the corresponding anti - quarks ) are given by @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the current mass of the strange quark , @xmath5 is the vacuum energy density inside the bag , and @xmath6 is the baryon number density , with @xmath7 representing the density of @xmath8 quark , @xmath9 quark , and @xmath10 quark . the basic hypothesis eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in qmdd model can easily be understand from the quark confinement mechanism . a confinement potential kr ( r@xmath11 ) must be added to a quark system in the phenomenological effective models because the the perturbative qcd can not give us the confinement solutions of quarks .",
    "the confinement potential prevents the quark from going to infinite or to the very large regions .",
    "the large volume means that the density is small .",
    "this mechanism of confinement can be mimicked through the requirement that the mass of an isolated quark becomes infinitely large so that the vacuum is unable to support it [ 11 , 12 ] .",
    "this is just the physical picture given by eqs ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "in fact , this confinement mechanism is very similar to that of mit bag model .",
    "but the advantage of qmdd model is that it does not need to introduce a quark confined boundary condition as that of the mit bag model .",
    "although the qmdd model is successful for describing the properties of sqm [ 8 - 11 ] , but it is still an ideal quark gas model . compared to the usual ideal quark gas model , the basic improvement of the qmdd model is that the quark masses depend on density and the quark confinement mechanism is mimicked .",
    "obviously , if we hope to investigate the physical properties of nucleons and hyperons by means of the qmdd model , the quark - quark interactions must be considered .",
    "following the line of qmc model , we will introduce quark and scalar @xmath12 field nonlinear coupling self - consistently to improve the qmdd model in this paper . as a first step",
    ", we ignore the s - quark and consider the coupling of @xmath8 and @xmath9 quarks to a non - linear scalar field only .",
    "we hope to emphasize there are two basic differences between our improved quark mass density- dependent ( iqmdd ) model and the usual qmc model suggested first by guichon [ 14 ] and developed by thomas , saito [ 15 ] and jennings .",
    "jin [ 16 ] .",
    "firstly , instead of a mit bag for nucleon in qmc model , we do not need a mit bag for nucleon in iqmdd model .",
    "the constraint of mit bag boundary condition disappears in our formulae because the quark confinement mechanism has been established in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "this is very important because it should provide a reasonable starting point for many - body calculations .",
    "secondly , the interaction between quark and scalar meson is limited in the bag regions for qmc model , bur for iqmdd model , this interaction is extended to the whole free space .",
    "in fact , our model is similar to that of the f - l model , but instead of massless quarks in the f - l model , the masses of @xmath8 and @xmath9 quarks in our model are given by eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the main formulae of iqmdd will be given in the next section .",
    "the numerical results for the ground state and a number of physical quantities , namely , the root - mean - squared ( rms ) charge radius @xmath13 , the magnetic moment @xmath14 , the ratio between the axial - vector and the vector @xmath0-decay coupling constants of the nucleon @xmath15 will be presented in the third section . in the fourth section",
    "we will study the lowest one particle excited states with even or odd parity .",
    "the last section is a summary and discussion .",
    "we now briefly outline the model and its pertinent features below .",

    "3 and sec . 4",
    "we discuss the ground state solution of the system now .",
    "define @xmath40 as the lowest positive energy wave function .",
    "it can be expressed as : @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the pauli matrices , @xmath43 or @xmath44 . the radial functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 satisfy : @xmath47v(r),\\ ] ] @xmath48u(r),\\ ] ] the normalized condition reads : @xmath49r^2dr=1,\\ ] ] and the equation of motion of @xmath12 field eq .",
    "( 13 ) becomes : @xmath50,\\ ] ] equations ( 15 ) , ( 16 ) and ( 18 ) can be solved with the boundary conditions : @xmath51 before numerical calculation , we address the parameters of the model first .",
    "there are four free parameters , namely , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath21 in iqmdd model .",
    "the parameters @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 fix the interaction potential @xmath55 , while @xmath21 measures the coupling between the quark and the scalar field .",
    "the set of equations ( 15 ) , ( 16 ) and ( 18 ) should be solved alternately until consistency was obtained using the iterative method [ 17 ] .",
    "once the solutions of the above equations are obtained , one can calculate a number of physical quantities pertaining to the three - quark system which have been measured from experiments .",
    "let @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 be , respectively , the rms charge radius , the magnetic moment , and the ratio between the axial - vector and the vector @xmath0-decay coupling constants of the nucleon .",
    "they satisfy [ 18 ] : @xmath59 @xmath60 and @xmath61 by using eq .",
    "( 14 ) , we find : @xmath62 @xmath63 and @xmath64    since in the present form the model is flavor independent , the charge radius of the neutron in the model is @xmath65 and the neutron magnetic moment is @xmath66 as given by the @xmath67 algebra .",
    "corrections to these relations arise only when qcd effects are included .",
    "for comparison let us remind ourselves that the experimental values of proton mass @xmath68 @xmath69 , the proton magnetic moment @xmath70 nuclear magnetons , @xmath71 , and the charge radius of proton @xmath72 fm . to do numerical calculation , we follow ref . [ 17 , 18 ] .",
    "we fix @xmath73 fm first .",
    "once the value is chosen , there are only three free parameters .",
    "we have studied mostly two families of parameters for ground system state .",
    "these are the @xmath74 and the @xmath75 mev cases respectively .",
    "each choice fixes one other parameter by a specific requirement for the shape of the potential .",
    "therefore it is sufficient to label our results by the coupling constant @xmath21 and constant @xmath76 .    our results for the two families @xmath77 mev )",
    "are summarized in three tables . through these tables",
    ", we use the units @xmath78 and use fm as the fundamental unit for length .",
    "we consider the case @xmath79 mev first .",

    "the variation of bag properties with the coupling constant @xmath21 for several values of @xmath54 is given in table .",
    "several features emerge from these calculations .",
    "firstly , we note that an increase of the coupling constant produces a continuous change from a volume quark distribution for small @xmath21 to a surface quark distribution for large @xmath21 .",
    "this change is illustrated in fig . 1 where we plot the quark density @xmath80 for three values of @xmath21 .",
    "it should be noted that shape of the soliton field does not change significantly with @xmath21 for given @xmath54 .",
    "the variations of the quark charge density as a function of the radius with increasing @xmath54 are plotted in fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 . when @xmath54 decreases , with a fixed value of @xmath21 , the quark charge distribution @xmath80 change slowly from surface to volume .",
    "this is illustrated in fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 for @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "the change from volume to surface quark charge density is also evident in the variations of the values of the magnetic moment @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "for instance from table .",
    "2 , when @xmath54 = @xmath83 , the magnetic moment varies with increasing @xmath21 from @xmath84 to @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the bohr magneton of the proton .",
    "similarly , @xmath15 varies from 1.21 for small @xmath21 to 0.618 for large @xmath21 .",
    "it is also found from the tables that for some @xmath54 and @xmath21 cases we can not found a solution for @xmath87 fm .",
    "the variation of the scalar field @xmath12 as a function of the radius for @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath79 mev is presented in fig .",
    "the value of @xmath12 inside the hadron is very different from that of outside : inside @xmath12 is less than zero , but outside @xmath12 approaches @xmath90 .",
