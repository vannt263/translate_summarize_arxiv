    "for any @xmath125 , we have @xmath126 where the integrals and are well defined by rellich s lemma  [ lem : rellich ] . since for almost every @xmath69 in @xmath43 , either @xmath127 or @xmath95 , the solutions of the system - can be written also in the form @xmath128 which is the weak formulation of @xmath129 next , since @xmath130 is bounded , thanks to rellich s lemma  [ lem : rellich ] , @xmath95 in @xmath131 , for @xmath132 large enough .",
    "in particular , @xmath116 and @xmath117 vanish in a ball contained in @xmath43 , which is open and connected , and the conclusion follows from theorem  [ thm : unicont ] , applied with @xmath127 , which in this case reduces to a well known result concerning the helmholtz equation .",
    "[ pro : step-2 ] let @xmath133 then @xmath134 .",

    "then , by assumption  [ assumption ] there exists @xmath50 such that @xmath51 for some @xmath47 and @xmath52 . to simplify notation , set @xmath135 .",
    "let us show that there exist a point @xmath136 on @xmath137 and a radius @xmath138 such that @xmath139 figure  [ fig : step2 ] sketches the configuration we have at hand around @xmath136 .",
    "[ fig : step2 ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    since @xmath140 has a @xmath4 boundary , for some ( smaller ) @xmath52 there exists a continuous map @xmath141 and a suitable orientation of axes such that @xmath142 and @xmath143 this alone does not prove our claim , since @xmath144 could still intersect @xmath145 when @xmath146 .",
    "since @xmath147 , there exists a sequence @xmath148 such that @xmath149 tends to @xmath99 .",
    "consider for a fixed and sufficiently large @xmath150 the line segment @xmath151 , and let @xmath152 be the least value of @xmath153 such that @xmath154 .",

    "we have established that there exists a ball @xmath165 such that @xmath166 , which is .",
    "now , thanks to proposition  [ prop : step1 ] , and noting that ( by fubini s theorem ) each @xmath167 is of measure zero , @xmath95 almost everywhere in @xmath168 .",
    "thus , for almost every @xmath169 , either @xmath95 or @xmath170 , and @xmath171 .",
    "considering the weak formulation of maxwell s equations , and arguing as in the proof of proposition  [ prop : step1 ] , we note that @xmath116 and @xmath117 are weak solutions of @xmath172 and vanish on the connected non - empty open set @xmath173 .",
    "since @xmath174 and @xmath175 satisfy , that is , @xmath176 theorem  [ thm : unicont ] shows that @xmath95 in @xmath177 .",
    "this in turn shows that @xmath116 and @xmath117 vanish on a ball inside @xmath178 , and applying theorem  [ thm : unicont ] in @xmath178 we obtain @xmath95 almost everywhere in @xmath178 .",
    "this contradiction concludes the proof .",

    "we have obtained that @xmath95 almost everywhere in @xmath29 , and therefore either @xmath95 or @xmath127 almost everywhere in @xmath78 .",
    "arguing as above , we deduce that @xmath179 is a weak solution of with @xmath127 everywhere and the conclusion of theorem  [ thm : no - defect ] follows from rellich s lemma .",
    "we extend our result to the case when defects of small measure are allowed in the medium .",
    "one application is to liquid crystals ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "namely , we assume that the permittivity and permeability are of the form @xmath180 where @xmath1 and @xmath0 satisfy - , @xmath181 is the indicator function of a measurable bounded set @xmath182 , such that @xmath183 and @xmath184 and @xmath185 are real symmetric positive definite matrices in @xmath20 satisfying - .",
    "[ thm : defect ] suppose that the electric and magnetic fields @xmath186 and @xmath187 are solutions of @xmath188 together with the silver - mller radiation condition , and that @xmath189 and @xmath190 are given by , with @xmath182 satisfying .",
    "suppose assumption  [ assumption ] holds",
    ". then , there exists a constant @xmath191 depending only on the measure @xmath192 of @xmath105 , @xmath193 and the lower and upper bounds @xmath194 and @xmath195 given in - such that if the measure of @xmath182 satisfies @xmath196 , then @xmath197 almost everywhere .    to prove theorem  [ thm : defect ] , we use the following variant of theorem  [ thm : no - defect ] .    [ pro : def-1 ] under the same assumptions as theorem[thm : no - defect ] , and assuming that holds , @xmath198    the proof follows from that of theorem[thm : no - defect ] , since by assumption for each @xmath37 , @xmath199 , and the boundary of @xmath200 is unaltered by the defects .    since admits a weak formulation , arguing as before we see using proposition[pro : def-1 ] that @xmath201 and @xmath202 have compact support in @xmath203 and are also solutions of @xmath204 where @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",
    "note that @xmath207 has compact support and is divergence free .",
    "thus the helmholtz decomposition ( see e.g. @xcite ) of @xmath207 shows there exists a unique @xmath208 such that @xmath209 on @xmath210 , @xmath211 and such that @xmath212 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath213 satisfies @xmath214 where @xmath215 is a universal constant .",
    "altogether this yields @xmath216 since @xmath217 is curl free , we deduce that there exists @xmath218 such that @xmath219 , and @xmath220 is uniquely defined by setting @xmath221 .",
    "noticing that @xmath222 is divergence free , and @xmath223 is compactly supported in @xmath105 we have that @xmath220 is the solution of @xmath224 since @xmath225 is divergence free , the right - hand side becomes @xmath226 to proceed , we compute using the cauchy - schwarz inequality the following bound @xmath227 and we have obtained that @xmath228 next note using proposition[pro : def-1 ] that @xmath229 the sobolev - gagliardo - nirenberg inequality in @xmath203 shows that @xmath230 where @xmath215 is a universal constant . therefore ,",
    "using hlder s inequality , together with the poincar - friedrichs estimate , we have @xmath231 altogether we have obtained @xmath232 repeating the same argument , but starting with @xmath233 , we obtain also @xmath234 the inequalities and imply that @xmath235 when @xmath236 where @xmath215 is a universal constant .",
    "the dependence of the threshold constant @xmath237 given by on @xmath193 and @xmath238 shows that for a permeability @xmath0 and a permittivity @xmath1 satisfying , and only , uniqueness for maxwell s equations holds provided , if @xmath106 is fixed , the domain @xmath29 is of small measure and bounded diameter , or , for a given @xmath29 , when the absolute value of the frequency @xmath193 is sufficiently small . in such cases",
    ", the whole domain @xmath29 can be taken as a defect @xmath182 ( and a fictitious ball containing @xmath182 plays the role of @xmath29 ) .",
    "we do not claim that the dependence of @xmath237 in terms of @xmath193 or @xmath192 in is optimal .",
