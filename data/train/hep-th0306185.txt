    "however , despite the uniqueness of @xmath4 supersymmetry , the low  energy actions crucially differ in the choice of the manifest `` duality symmetries '' of the lagrangian , since different sets of fields survive the orientifold projection , and therefore different symmetries are manifestly preserved . leaving the brane degrees of freedom aside ,",
    "these duality symmetries are specified by their action on the ( twelve ) bulk vectors .",

    "we do not address either the question of unbroken supersymmetries or the question of moduli stabilisation , which would require the knowledge of the scalar potential and a study of the fermionic sector .",
    "however , we can anticipate that certain moduli are indeed stabilised in all these models , since a higgs effect is taking place as suggested by the presence of charged axion couplings .",

    ", we give a preliminary description of gauged supergravity , for the particular case of type iib orientifolds with some three  form fluxes turned on . in section 5",
    "some conclusions are drawn .",
    "finally , in appendix some useful formulae needed to compute the quadratic part of the vector field strengths in the lagrangian , are given .",
    "in this section we review the construction of orientifold models preserving @xmath52 supersymmetries in @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this is the simplest setting for orientifold constructions , and consists of modding out type ii superstrings by the world ",
    "sheet parity @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , the orientifold projection can be given a suggestive geometrical interpretation in terms of non  dynamical defects , the orientifold @xmath54planes , that reflect the left  handed and right  handed modes of the closed string .",
    "actually , one can combine world  sheet parity with other ( geometrical ) operations .",
    "in general , this can affect the nature of the orientifold planes , that , in the simplest instance of a bare @xmath53 have negative tension and r  r charge , and are @xmath55dimensional ( @xmath56 planes ) since they have to respect the full lorentz symmetry preserved by @xmath53 .",
    "in the present paper , we are interested in the class of models generated by the @xmath57 generator , where @xmath1 denotes the inversion on @xmath2 coordinates . of course",
    ", @xmath58 must be a symmetry of the parent theory , and this is the case of type iib for @xmath59 odd , and of type iia for @xmath59 even .",
    "actually , @xmath57 reflects the action of t - duality in orientifold models .",
    "indeed , t - duality itself can be thought of as a chiral parity transformation @xmath60 and conjugates @xmath53 so to get @xmath61 as a result , the full ten  dimensional lorentz symmetry is now broken to the subgroup @xmath62 , and the closed ",
    "string sector involves @xmath63 planes sitting at the fixed points of the orbifold @xmath64 .",
    "the associated open - string sector will then correspond to open strings with dirichlet boundary conditions along @xmath65 , i.e. open strings ending on d@xmath66 branes . as usual",
    ", tadpole conditions will fix the rank of the chan ",
    "paton gauge group , i.e. the total number of d - branes . in the present paper , however , we shall not be concerned with open  string degrees of freedom and we shall concentrate our analysis solely on the closed - string degrees of freedom .    before we turn to the description of specific models ,",
    "a general comment is in order .",
    "an important requirement in the construction is that the orientifold group be @xmath67 , i.e. its generator @xmath57 must square to the identity .",
    "although @xmath53 has always @xmath68 eigenvalues , and thus @xmath69 , this is not the case for @xmath1 . for example , for @xmath40 @xmath70 would correspond to a @xmath71 rotation on a two  plane and , although its action on the bosonic degrees of freedom is real and assigns to them a plus or minus sign according to the number of indices along the two  plane , its eigenvalue on spinors is @xmath72 , where @xmath73 are the two helicities .",
    "thus , it does not square to the identity , but rather to @xmath74 , with @xmath37 the ( total ) space  time fermion number",
    ". therefore , in this case the orientifold projection needs be modified by the inclusion of @xmath75 , with @xmath76 the left - handed space ",
    "time fermion number @xcite .",
    "we are thus dealing with the four - dimensional orientifolds @xmath77^{\\left[{9-p \\over 2}\\right ] } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath78 $ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath79 . here",
    "we have decomposed the six - torus as @xmath80 since @xmath1 only acts on the coordinates of @xmath65 , while leaves invariant those along @xmath81 .",
    "as we shall see , this is a natural decomposition since , in the orientifold , we are left with the perturbative symmetry @xmath82 of the compactification torus . to fix the notation , in this paper we shall label coordinates on the @xmath0 with a pair of indices @xmath83 , where @xmath84 counts the coordinates not affected by the space parity ( those coordinates that would be longitudinal to the branes ) , while @xmath85 runs over the coordinates of @xmath65 ( orthogonal to the branes ) . as usual ,",
    "greek indices @xmath86 will label coordinates on the four  dimensional minkowski space  time .    at this point",
    ", it is better to consider the cases @xmath59 odd or @xmath59 even separately . in the first case ,",
    "@xmath87^{\\left[{9-p \\over 2}\\right]}$ ] is a symmetry in type iib , while in the latter case it is properly defined within type iia .      in type iib superstring",
    "we have to consider four cases , corresponding to the allowed choices @xmath88 .",
    "the massless ten - dimensional fields have a well defined parity with respect to @xmath53 : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the metric tensor , @xmath91 the dilaton , @xmath92 the kalb  ramond two - form , and @xmath93 are the r ",
    "r @xmath94-forms is constrained to have a self  dual field strength , a peculiarity of type iib ] .",
    "henceforth , it is straightforward to select the four - dimensional excitations that survive the orientifold projection .",
    "in fact , after splitting the ten - dimensional index @xmath95 in the triple @xmath96 labelling @xmath97 , it is evident that the fields with an odd ( even ) number of @xmath98type indices are odd ( even ) under the action of @xmath1 . on the other hand , when present , @xmath75 assigns a plus sign to the ns - ns states ( which originate from the decomposition of the product of two bosonic representations of @xmath99 ) and a minus sign to the r ",
    "r states ( which originate from the decomposition of the product of two spinorial representations of @xmath99 ) . at the end , aside from the four  dimensional metric tensor , one is left with the massless ( bosonic ) degrees of freedom listed in table 1 .",

    "in the present section we consider the deformation of @xmath4 supergravity induced by the presence of fluxes .",
    "we shall restrict our analysis , here , only to iib orientifolds with some ( three  form ) fluxes turned on , while we shall defer the study of more general fluxes and of the gauge structure of other models elsewhere .    differently to what happened in the well  studied @xmath103 orientifolds , non  abelian gauged supergravities ( for the bulk sector ) now emerge , due to the presence of gauge fields originating from the ten  dimensional metric , and of axionic scalars associated to the ns  ns two  form @xmath26 .      in this model ,",
