    "about a decade ago , galactic plane surveys revealed large numbers of infrared dark clouds ( irdcs , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these are identified as dark patches against the diffuse galactic mid - infrared background .",
    "first studies of very opaque irdcs suggested that these have very high densities , column densities , and masses ( @xmath2\\gtrsim{}10 ^ 5~\\rm{}cm^{-3}$ ] , @xmath3\\gtrsim{}10^{23}~\\rm{}cm^{-2}$ ] , @xmath4 ; @xcite ) . since they are dark , they are likely to be in an early evolutionary phase . embedded in irdcs are `` cores '' of a few dozen solar masses @xcite .",
    "it has therefore been suggested that many irdcs are the long - sought examples of clouds just at the onset of the formation of massive stars and ( proto-)clusters .",
    "this notion was corroborated by observations of young massive stars in a few individual irdcs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such views also form the framework of schemes for irdc evolution ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) and reviews ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "irdc samples are usually compared to regions of massive star formation ( msf ) , such as orion and m17 ( e.g. , @xcite).[sec : introduction ]    this picture can not be complete , though .",
    "the above studies ( and @xcite ) acknowledge that regions forming low and intermediate mass stars can also appear as shadows in images at mid - infrared wavelength @xcite .",
    "such irdcs will not form massive stars .",
    "unfortunately , the number of irdcs evolving towards msf is presently not known .",
    "fractions up to 100% have been considered in the past ( section [ sec : most - stars - irdc ] ) .    in this letter",

    "figure [ fig : msf - limit ] illustrates why clouds bound for msf must exceed eq.([eq : mass - size - limit ] ) . since star formation necessitates an appropriate mass reservoir , msf requires that a large mass is concentrated in a relatively small volume . based on more detailed theoretical considerations , section [ sec : msf - limits ]",

    "this suggests to use eq.([eq : mass - size - limit ] ) to roughly separate irdcs with ( future ) msf from those without .",

    "very clearly , they do not reside in the mass - size space unambiguously associated with the formation of massive stars .",
    "however , before drawing final conclusions , let us consider some biases affecting our analysis .",
    "first , @xcite derive masses using clumpfind , while @xcite use gaussclumps . for the former ,",
    "paper i showed explicitly that the derived masses are , for given radius , just @xmath39 of those derived using our dendrogram approach .",
    "for the latter , the same is expected , since the gaussian fits only describe a fraction of the emission .",
    "in a given map , our characterization scheme from papers i and ii would thus find larger masses .",
    "these biases are countered by other factors , though .",
    "we use the ` case a ' masses ( assuming bright ir foregrounds ) provided by @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , their ` case b ' ( fainter foregrounds ) appears to be more realistic .",
    "the masses could thus be lower by a factor @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite suggests @xmath14-to - mass conversion factors lower than used by @xcite . in any case",
    ", similar biases affect the data for msf regions .",
    "differences between these and irdcs are not likely to only come from observational uncertainties",
    ".    finally , none of the irdcs in the @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite samples are `` typical '' for the general galactic population . @xcite and @xcite select clouds which are unusually dark in @xmath19 images .",
    "@xcite only characterize irdcs which are relatively large and dark , and are clearly detected in @xmath14 emission .",
    "all this excludes irdcs of low mass and density from the samples .",
    "less biased irdc samples should thus be less compact than derived here .",
    "the @xcite catalogue lists irdc angular sizes and column densities for the entire galactic plane covered by spitzer .",

    "second , the compact clouds contain most of the mass ( more accurately : most of the area - integrated column density ) seen in these irdcs , even for small irdc distances .",
    "unfortunately , the @xcite survey is ( like most extinction studies ) uncertain in the sense that it assumes that the diffuse galactic emission can be reliably modelled in its spatial distribution .",
    "this may not be true .",
    "in this spirit , the results from this section should be taken as an indication , not as a final result .",

    "[ fig : msf - limit ] ) .",
    "the global structure of these clouds can usually be described by power laws , @xmath66 , with @xmath67 ( paper ii ) .",
    "such power laws imply that msf clouds violate @xmath68 ( eq .  [ eq : mass - size - limit ] ) . depending on slope ( @xmath7 ) , intercept ( @xmath8 ) , and their interplay , such excesses are expected for radii @xmath69 ( fig.[fig : msf - limit ] ) .",
    "this is just what we find for msf clouds ( fig.[fig : mass - size - comparison][b ] ) .",
    "msf is thus only possible if a clouds slopes are shallow , intercepts are large , or both , when compared to eq.([eq : mass - size - limit ] ) .",

    "pure differences in @xmath8 imply that msf and non - msf clouds only differ in their absolute properties .",
    "differences in slopes @xmath7 , however , imply _ relative _ differences in the structure , such as deviations in the hierarchical cloud structure .",
    "the irdc properties mentioned in the introduction ( @xmath2\\gtrsim{}10 ^ 5~\\rm{}cm^{-3}$ ] , @xmath3\\gtrsim{}10^{23}~\\rm{}cm^{-2}$ ] , @xmath4 ) only seem to characterize the densest patches in very large and massive irdcs .",
