    "according to the standard quantum mechanics ( sqm ) , the complete description of a system of particles is provided by its wavefunction .",
    "the empirical predictions of sqm follow from a mathematical formalism which makes no use of the assumption that matter consists of particles pursuing definite tracks in space - time .",
    "it follows that the results of the experiments designed to test the predictions of the theory , do not permit us to infer any statement regarding the particle  not even its independent existence .",
    "but , in the bohmian quantum mechanics ( bqm ) , the additional element that is introduced apart from the wavefunction is the particle position , conceived in the classical sense as pursuing a definite continuous track in space - time [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "the detailed predictions made by this causal interpretation explains how the results of quantum experiments come about but it is claimed that they are not tested by them . in fact",
    "when bohm @xcite presented his theory in 1952 , experiments could be done with an almost continuous beam of particles , but not with individual particles .",
    "thus , bohm constructed his theory in such a fashion that it would be impossible to distinguish observable predictions of his theory from sqm .",
    "this can be seen from bell s comment about empirical equivalence of the two theories when he said:_it _ [ the de broglie - bohm version of non - relativistic quantum mechanics ] _ is experimentally equivalent to the usual version insofar as the latter is unambiguous_\"@xcite .",
    "however , could it be that a certain class of phenomena might correspond to a well - posed problem in one theory but to none in the other ? or might the additional particles and definite trajectories of bohm s theory lead to a prediction of an observable where sqm would just have no definite prediction to make ? to draw discrepancy from experiments involving the particle track , we have to argue in such a way that the observable predictions of the modified theory are in some way functions of the trajectory assumption . the question raised here",
    "is whether the de broglie - bohm particle law of motion can be made relevant to experiment . at first",
    ", it seems that definition of time spent by a particle within a classically forbidden barrier provides a good evidence for the preference of bqm .",
    "but , there are difficult technical questions , both theoretically and experimentally , that are still unsolved about this tunnelling times @xcite .",
    "a recent work indicates that it is not practically feasible to use tunnelling effect to distinguish between the two theories @xcite .    on the other hand , englert _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and scully @xcite have claimed that in some cases bohm s approach gives results that disagree with those obtained from sqm and , in consequence , with experiment .",
    "again , at first dewdney _",
    "_ @xcite and then hiley _",
    "@xcite showed that the specific objections raised by englert _ et al . _ and scully can not be sustained .",
    "furthermore , hiley believes that no experiment can decide between the standard interpretation and bohm s interpretation .",
    "however , vigier @xcite , in his recent work , has given a brief list of new experiments which suggest that the u(1 ) invariant massless photon assumed properties of light within the standard interpretation , are too restrictive and that the o(3 ) invariant massive photon causal de broglie - bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics , is now supported by experiments .",
    "furthermore , in some of the recent investigation , some feasible experiments have been suggested to distinguish between sqm and bqm @xcite . in one work ,",
    "ghose indicated that although bqm is equivalent to sqm when averages of dynamical variables are taken over a gibbs ensemble of bohmian trajectories , the equivalence breaks down for ensembles built over clearly separated short intervals of time in specially entangled two - bosonic particle systems @xcite .",
    "another one @xcite is an extension of ghose s work to show disagreement between sqm and bqm in a two - particle system with an unentangled wavefunction , particularly at the statistical level .",
    "further discussion of this subject can be found in [ 13 - 15 ] . in that experiment , to obtain a different interference pattern from sqm , we must deviate the source from its geometrically symmetric location .    in this investigation , we are offering a new thought experiment which can decide between sqm and bqm . here , the deviation of the source from its geometrical symmetric location is not necessary and we have used a system consisting two correlated particles with an entangled wavefunction .    in the following section ,",
    "we have introduced a two double - slit experimental set - up . in section 3 ,",
    "bohm s interpretation is used to find some observable results about our suggested experiment .",
    "predictions of the standard interpretation and their comparison with bohmian predictions is examined in section 4 . in section 5 , we have used selective detection and have compared sqm and bqm with our thought experiment at the ensemble level of particles , and we state our conclusion in section 6 .",
    "and then they pass through slits @xmath0 and @xmath1 or @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "finally , they are detected on @xmath4 and @xmath5 screens , simultaneously .",
    "it is necessary to note that dotted lines are not real trajectories.,width=566,height=302 ]",
    "to distinguish between sqm and bqm we consider the following experimental set - up .",
    "a pair of identical non - relativistic particles with total momentum zero labelled by 1 and 2 , originate from a point source s that is placed exactly in the middle of a two double - slit screens as shown in fig .",
    "we assume that the intensity of the beam is so low that during any individual experiment we have only a single pair of particles passing through the slits and the detectors have the opportunity to relate together for performing selective detection process .",
    "in addition , we assume that the detection screens @xmath4 and @xmath5 register only those pairs of particles that reach the two screens simultaneously .",
    "thus , we are sure that the registration of single particles is eliminated from final interference pattern . the detection process at the screens @xmath4 and @xmath5 may be nontrivial but they play no causal role in the basic phenomenon of the interference of particles waves @xcite",
    ". in the two - dimensional system of coordinates @xmath6 whose origin @xmath7 is shown , the center of slits lie at the points @xmath8 .",
    "the wave incident on the slits will be taken as a plane of the form @xmath9}e^{-iet/\\hbar}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is a constant and @xmath11 is the total energy of the system of the two particles .",
    "the plane wave assumption comes from large distance between source @xmath7 and double - slit screens . to avoid the mathematical complexity of fresnel diffraction at a sharp - edge slit",
    ", we suppose the slits have soft edges that generate waves having identical gaussian profiles in the @xmath12-direction while the plane wave in the @xmath13-direction is unaffected @xcite .",
    "the instant at which the packets are formed will be taken as our zero of time . therefore , the four waves emerging from the slits @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath1 are initially @xmath14}\\ ] ] @xmath15}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the half - width of each slit . at time",
    "@xmath17 the general total wavefunction at a space point @xmath6 of our considered system for bosonic and fermionic particles is given by @xmath18\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath19}\\ ] ] @xmath20}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is a reparametrization constant that its value is unimportant in this paper and @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 , according to bqm , are initial group velocities corresponding to each particle in the @xmath13- and @xmath12-directions , respectively .",
    "in addition , the upper and lower sings in the total wavefunction refer to symmetric and anti - symmetric wavefunction under exchange of particle 1 to particle 2 , corresponding to bosonic and fermionic property , while in the equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) they refer to upper and lower slits , respectively . in the next section ,",
    "we have used bqm to drive some results of this experiment .",
    "in bqm , the complete description of a system is given by specifying the position of the particles in addition to their wavefunction which has the role of guiding the particles according to following guidance condition for @xmath25 particles , with masses @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is a solution of schr@xmath30dinger s wave equation .",
    "thus , instead of sqm with indistinguishable particles , in bqm the path of particles or their individual histories distinguishes them and each one of them can be studied separately @xcite .",
    "in addition , belousek @xcite in his recent work , concluded that the problem of bohmian mechanical particles being statistically ( in)distinguishable is a matter of theory choice underdetermined by logic and experiment , and that such particles are in any case physically distinguishable . for our considered experiment ,",
    "the speed of the particles 1 and 2 in the @xmath12-direction is given , respectively , by @xmath31 @xmath32 with the replacement of @xmath33 from ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , we have @xmath34\\psi_{a_{1}}\\psi_{b^{'}_{2}}\\cr             & \\pm&[-2(y_{1}+y+u_{y}t)/4\\sigma_{0}\\sigma_{t}-ik_{y}]\\psi_{a_{2}}\\psi_{b^{'}_{1}}\\cr             & + & [ -2(y_{1}+y+u_{y}t)/4\\sigma_{0}\\sigma_{t}-ik_{y}]\\psi_{b_{1}}\\psi_{a^{'}_{2}}\\cr             & \\pm&[-2(y_{1}-y - u_{y}t)/4\\sigma_{0}\\sigma_{t}+ik_{y}]\\psi_{b_{2}}\\psi_{a^{'}_{1}}]\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath35\\psi_{a_{1}}\\psi_{b^{'}_{2}}\\cr             & \\pm&[-2(y_{2}-y - u_{y}t)/4\\sigma_{0}\\sigma_{t}+ik_{y}]\\psi_{a_{2}}\\psi_{b^{'}_{1}}\\cr             & + & [ -2(y_{2}-y - u_{y}t)/4\\sigma_{0}\\sigma_{t}+ik_{y}]\\psi_{b_{1}}\\psi_{a^{'}_{2}}\\cr             & \\pm&[-2(y_{2}+y+u_{y}t)/4\\sigma_{0}\\sigma_{t}-ik_{y}]\\psi_{b_{2}}\\psi_{a^{'}_{1}}]\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , for example , the short notation @xmath36 is used .",
    "furthermore , from ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) it is clear that @xmath37 which indicates the reflection symmetry of @xmath33 with respect to the @xmath13axis . utilizing this symmetry in ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) , we can see that @xmath38 which are valid for both bosonic and fermionic particles .",
    "relations ( 16 ) show that if @xmath39 , then the speed of each particles in the @xmath12-direction is zero along the symmetry axis @xmath13 .",
    "this means that none of the particles can cross the @xmath13-axis nor are they tangent to it , provided both of them are simultaneously on this axis .",
    "similar conclusions can be found in some other works [ for example , 8 , 9 , 11 - 13 ] .",
    "it can be seen that there is the same symmetry of the velocity about the @xmath13-axis as for an ordinary double - slit experiment @xcite .",
    "if we consider @xmath40 to be the vertical coordinate of the center of mass of the two particles , then we can write @xmath41 solving the equation of motion ( 17 ) , we obtain the path of the @xmath12-coordinate of the center of mass @xmath42 if at @xmath43 the center of mass of the two particles is exactly on the @xmath13-axis , then @xmath44 , and the center of mass of the particles will always remain on the @xmath13-axis . thus , according to bqm , the two particles will be detected at points symmetric with respect to the @xmath13-axis , as shown in fig",
    "it seems that calculation of quantum potential can give us another perspective of this experiment . as we know",
    ", to see the connection between the wave and particle , the schr@xmath30dinger equation can be rewritten in the form of a generalized hamilton - jacobi equation that has the form of the classical equation , apart from the extra term @xmath45 where function q has been called the quantum potential @xcite .",
    "but , it is clear that the calculation and analysis of q , by using our total wavefunction ( 4 ) , is not very simple . on the other hand",
    ", we can use the form of newton s second law , in which the particle is subject to a quantum force @xmath46 in addition to the classical force @xmath47 @xcite , namely @xmath48 now , if we utilize the equation of motion of the center of mass @xmath12-coordinate ( 18 ) and the equation ( 20 ) , we shall obtain the quantum potential for the center of mass motion @xmath49 .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath50 @xmath51 where the result of equation ( 21 ) is clearly due to motion of plane wave in the @xmath13-direction .",
    "in addition , we assume that @xmath52 in our experiment . thus , our effective quantum potential is only a function of @xmath12-variable and it has the form @xmath53 if @xmath44 , the quantum potential for the center of mass of the two particles is zero at all times and it remains on the @xmath13-axis .",
    "however , if @xmath54 , then the center of mass can not touch or cross the @xmath13-axis .",
    "these conclusions are consistent with our earlier result ( eq .",
    "so far , we have been studying the results obtained from bqm at the individual level .",
    "but it is well known from sqm that the probability of simultaneous detection of two particles at @xmath55 and @xmath56 , at the screen @xmath4 and @xmath5 is equal to @xmath57 the parameter @xmath58 , which is taken to be small , is a measure of the size of the detectors .",
    "it is clear that the probabilistic prediction of sqm is in disagreement with the symmetrical prediction of bqm , because sqm predicts that probability of asymmetrical detection at the individual level of pair of particles can be different from zero , in opposition to bqm s symmetrical predictions .",
    "in addition , based on sqm s prediction , the probability of finding two particles at one side of the @xmath13-axis can be nonzero while we showed that bqm s prediction forbids such events in our experiment . in other words",
    ", its probability must be exactly zero .",
    "thus , if we provide necessary arrangements to perform this experiment , we must abandon one of the two theories or even both as a complete description of the universe .",
    "now the question arises as to whether this difference persists if we deal with an ensemble of pair of particles ? to answer this question , we consider an ensemble of pair of particles that have arrived at the detection screens @xmath4 and @xmath5 at different times @xmath59 .",
    "it is well known that , in order to ensure the compatibility between sqm and bqm for ensemble of particles , bohm added a further postulate to his three basic and consistent postulates @xcite .",
    "based on this further postulate , the probability that a particle in the ensemble lies between @xmath60 and @xmath61 at time @xmath17 is given by @xmath62 thus , using bqm , the probability of simultaneous detection for all pairs of particles of the ensemble arriving at the two screens at different instant of time @xmath59 , with @xmath44 , is @xmath63 where every term in the sum shows only one pair arriving on the screens @xmath4 and @xmath5 at the point @xmath64 and time @xmath59 , weighted by the corresponding density @xmath65 .",
    "if all times of @xmath59 are taken to be @xmath17 , then the summation on @xmath66 can be changed to an integral over all paths that cross the screens @xmath4 and @xmath5 at that time .",
    "now , we can consider the joint probability of two points @xmath55 and @xmath56 on the two screens at time @xmath17 that are not symmetric about the @xmath13-axis , but we know that they are not detected simultaneously .",
    "then , one can obtain the probability of detecting two particles at two arbitrary points @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xmath67 which is similar to the prediction of sqm ( eq .",
    "( 24 ) ) but obtained in a bohmian way @xcite .",
    "thus , it appears that for a geometrically symmetric arrangement , the possibility of distinguishing the two theories at the statistical level is impossible , as was expected [ 1 - 3 , 9 , 17 ] .",
    "in the previous section , we have shown that sqm and bqm have different predictions for our suggested experiment , at the individual level . since sqm talks about individual events in probabilistic terms , the existence of different predictions by the two theories at the individual level is not a strange result .",
    "on the other hand , we have seen that the two theories , for a geometrically symmetric arrangement , are consistent at the ensemble level . here , one can ask whether the individual level is the only area to distinguish between the two theories and whether the disagreement between them can not appear at the ensemble level . in this section",
    ", we answer this question in negative , and we shall provide conditions under which sqm can be interpreted as a vague theory at the ensemble level .      we have seen that the assumption of @xmath44 is not in contradiction with the statistically results of sqm and , in consequence , with experiment .",
    "thus , we can assume that initially each particle in the source is statistically distributed according to the absolute square of the wavefunction , but , this distribution is completely symmetric so that the @xmath12-coordinate of the center of mass is on the @xmath13-axis .",
    "if we can prepare such a special source with two correlated particles , we can try to do our experiment in the following fashion : particles emitted from the source @xmath7 into the right hand side of the experimental set - up can pass through slits @xmath0 or @xmath2 .",
    "since we have assumed that the total momentum of the pair of particles is zero , if one of the particles goes through the slit @xmath0 for instance , the other particle must go through the slit @xmath1 on the left hand side of the experimental set - up .",
    "based on bqm and using equation ( 16 ) , we infer that the particle passing through the slit @xmath0 must be detected on the upper half plane of the @xmath13-axis on the screen @xmath4 .",
    "the same thing must occur for the other particle that passes through @xmath1 , but in the lower half plane of the @xmath13-axis on the @xmath5 screen . using this prediction , we assume that only those particles arriving at @xmath5 are recorded for which there is a simultaneous detection of the other particle at the upper side on @xmath4 .",
    "we called this special detection , in which some of the selected particles are recorded , a selective detection .",
    "thus , based on the prediction power of bqm , we will record two particles symmetric with respect to the @xmath13-axis , for each emitted pairs of particles .",
    "if we wait to record an ensemble of particles , we will see an interference pattern of particles on the lower half plane of the @xmath5 screen . on the other hand , based on sqm , the probability of finding a particle at any point on the @xmath5 screen , even at the upper side , is nonzero and",
    "there is no compulsion to detect pairs of particles symmetrically on the two sides of the @xmath13-axis , as it can be seen from equation ( 24 ) and is depicted in fig .",
    "1 . therefore ,",
    "if we accept that sqm is still efficient and unambiguous for the selective detection , the interference pattern will be seen on the whole screen @xmath5 , particularly at the upper side of it , at the ensemble level .",
    "consequently , we shall have observable results to distinguish the two theories , sqm and bqm .",
    "one can argue that @xmath68 can not have a well - defined position and it must be distributed according to born s principle . however , we will show that this objection can not alter our obtained results .",
    "assume that , @xmath69 but @xmath70 . if we provide conditions in which @xmath71 is very small and @xmath72 , we can still detect particles symmetrically with respect to the @xmath13-axis , with a good approximation . to obtain symmetrical detection about the @xmath13-axis with reasonable approximation , the center of mass variation from the @xmath13-axis must be smaller than the distance between any two neighboring maxima , that is @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the de broglie wavelength .",
    "for conditions @xmath72 , @xmath75 and using equation ( 18 ) , one can obtain @xmath76 therefore , if we use a source with @xmath77 , we shall obtain @xmath78 for each individual observation , and our symmetrical detection can be maintained with a good approximation . it is evident that , if one considers @xmath79 , as was done in @xcite , the incompatibility between the two theories will be disappeared .",
    "but , we believe that , instead of the usual one - particle two - slit experiment with @xmath80 , our correlated two - particle system provides a new situation in which we can adjust @xmath68 independent of @xmath16 , so that @xmath81 although it is obvious that @xmath82 , but position correlation between the two entangled particles cause that they always satisfy equation ( 30 ) .",
    "furthermore , if it is assumed that @xmath68 is statistically distributed , another problem can be raised , which is mentioned by marchildon @xcite .",
    "we have shown that , if both particles are simultaneously on the @xmath13-axis , both velocities in the @xmath12-direction vanish , and neither particle could cross or be tangent to the @xmath13-axis . however , under @xmath70 condition , pairs of particles can not be simultaneously on the @xmath13-axis and we have not the aforementioned constraint on the motion of particles ( relations ( 16 ) ) . however , using our selective detection , we can still obtain our last result , because the center of mass of the two particles are on the @xmath13-axis with reasonable approximation .",
    "it is clear that , under such a condition , one can not claim that the particle detected at the upper ( lower ) side must have passed through upper ( lower ) slit , in spite of @xmath44 condition . to confirm these results ,",
    "it is worth noting that , durr _ et al . _",
    "@xcite argue that the selective detection can alter the statistical predictions of the two theories:_note that by selectively forgetting results we can dramatically alter the statistics of those that we have not forgotten .",
    "this is a striking illustration of the way in which bohmian mechanics does not merely agree with the quantum formalism , but , eliminating ambiguities , clarifies , and sharpens it . _ \" . elsewhere",
    "@xcite , we have utilized another kind of selective detection by which we could alter statistical prediction of sqm , using bqm for an interference device that contains two unentangled particles .",
    "in this investigation , we have suggested an experiment to distinguish between sqm and bqm .",
    "in fact , we believe that some particular experiments that for one reason or another have not yet been performed can decide between them . thus , it has been shown that a two double - slit experiment set - up , along with a source of two identical non - relativistic particles with total momentum of zero , emitted at suitable time intervals , has the following characteristics : + 1 ) the suggested experiment will yield different observable predictions for sqm and bqm , at the individual level . + 2 ) the two theories yield the same interference pattern at the ensemble level without using a selective detection , as is expected .",
    "+ 3 ) since in bqm the particles are distinguishable and their past history are known , using selective detection , it has been shown that either the two theories will predict different results at the statistical level , or that bqm has more predictive power than sqm .",
    "it is shown that selective detection can be considered as a tool for arriving to a new realm in which trajectory interpretation is sharply formulated , while the standard interpretation is ambiguous and silent even at the ensemble level .",
