    "the study of knots and links was invigorated in 1984 by the introduction of the jones polynomial @xcite .",
    "it allowed solution of many long standing problems in knot theory including the tate conjectures .",
    "one drawback was that the jones polynomial is hard to compute for complicated knots and links .",
    "then in 1987 kauffman introduced the kauffman bracket polynomial @xcite .",
    "easier to compute than the jones polynomial , it carries essentially the same information ( modulo framing and orientation ) . the fact that the kauffman bracket takes framings into account makes it an ideal tool for studying links in arbitrary 3-manifolds , which need not have a canonical framing .",
    "a major question at this time was how to consturct something similar to the jones polynomial for links in any 3-manifold .",
    "one approach was via topological quantum field theory .",
