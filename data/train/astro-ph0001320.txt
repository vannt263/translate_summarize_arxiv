    "in a bottom - up scenario of structure formation massive galaxy clusters form from rare , extreme overdensities in the primordial density fluctuation field . at what redshift clusters of a given mass collapse and",
    "virialize depends sensitively on the chosen structure formation theory .",
    "the comoving number density of clusters as a function of redshift ( and , ideally , also of mass ) is thus an important statistic that is well suited to constrain cosmological and physical parameters of structure formation models .",
    "the tightest constraints can be obtained from observations of very distant , very massive clusters which are the rarest in all cosmological models .    since clusters are bright x - ray sources , wide angle x - ray surveys are an excellent way of compiling sizeable cluster samples out to cosmological redshifts ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "several such samples have been compiled ( and/or published ) in the past decade ; an overview of the solid angles and flux limits of these surveys is presented in figure  1 .",
    "two kinds of surveys can be distinguished : serendipitous cluster surveys ( bright sharc , cfa 160 deg@xmath8 survey , emss , rdcs , sharc - s , warps ) and contiguous area surveys ( bcs , bcs - e , nep , rass - bs , reflex ) .",
    "the former surveys use data from pointed x - ray observations , whereas the latter are all based on the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) . with the exception of the nep survey @xcite , all contiguous cluster surveys cover close to , or more than , 10,000 square degrees but are limited to the x - ray brightest clusters . this fundamental difference in depth and sky coverage",
    "has important consequences . as shown in fig .  1 ,",
    "the nep survey as well as all serendipitous cluster surveys ( with the possible exception of the emss ) cover too small a solid angle to detect a significant number of x - ray luminous clusters .",
    "the rass large - area surveys , on the other hand , are capable of finding these rarest systems , but are too shallow to detect them in large numbers at @xmath9 .",
    "we are thus in the unfortunate situation that the cosmologically most important systems , the massive , distant clusters , are poorly sampled by all existing x - ray cluster surveys . at low to moderate x - ray luminosities where the number statistics have greatly improved most of the above surveys find little , if any , evolution out to redshifts of @xmath10 @xcite . at higher luminosities , however , the emss and cfa cluster surveys find evidence of strong negative evolution already at @xmath9 .",
    "it is worth bearing in mind though that the latter results are based on very small samples or , in fact , non - detections .",
    "macs ( massive cluster survey ) was designed to find the population of ( possibly ) strongly evolving clusters , i.e. , the most x - ray luminous systems at @xmath9 . by doing so , macs will re - measure the rate of evolution and test the results obtained by the emss and cfa cluster surveys .",
    "unless negative evolution is very rapid indeed , macs will find a sizeable number of these systems and thus provide us with targets for in - depth studies of the physical mechanisms driving cluster evolution and structure formation .    as indicated in fig .  1 , macs aims to achieve these goals by combining the largest solid angle of any rass cluster survey with the lowest possible x - ray flux limit .",
    "drawing from the list of 18,000 x - ray sources listed in the rass bright source catalog ( bsc ) macs applies the following selection criteria : @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( to ensure observability from mauna kea ; the resulting solid angle is 22,735 deg@xmath8 ) , x - ray hardness ratio greater than a limiting ( @xmath13 dependent ) value derived from the bcs sample @xcite , and @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the detect cell flux in the 0.12.4 kev band in units of @xmath16 erg @xmath17 s@xmath3 .",
    "cluster candidates are tentatively identified from digitized sky survey images , and are confirmed or discarded by r band imaging observations with the university of hawaii s 2.2 m telescope .",
    "this process has , so far , resulted in the identification of more than 700 clusters of galaxies at all redshifts ; fig .",
    "2 shows the redshift distribution of the 602 systems with spectroscopic redshifts . as a by - product , macs has thus already delivered the by far largest x - ray selected cluster catalogue to emerge from the rass to date .",
    "our spectroscopic follow - up observations focus exclusively on the most distant of these clusters .",
    "redshifts are estimated from the imaging data , and spectroscopic observations with the uh2.2 m and keck 10 m telescopes are performed of all systems with @xmath18 .",
    "a prediction for the size of the final macs sample can be obtained from the macs selection function and the local cluster x - ray luminosity function . in a no - evolution scenario",
    "we expect to find 57 clusters at @xmath9 and @xmath19 , and 151 at @xmath20 and @xmath14 .",
    "more than 20 macs clusters are predicted to lie at @xmath21 .",
    "this constitutes an improvement of a factor of about 50 over existing samples in the same redshift and luminosity range .",
    "the macs cluster sample currently comprises 41 systems with spectroscopic redshifts in the range @xmath1 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "an additional 85 macs sources with photometric redshifts @xmath0 are scheduled for spectroscopic observation .",
    "the completeness of this preliminary sample can not be easily quantified . however , the bright part of the macs / bsc source list ( @xmath19 ) has been mostly identified , and the completeness of the sample of ( presently ) 25 clusters found above this higher flux limit can be estimated .",
    "we thus use this subsample to attempt to constrain cluster evolution at the very highest x - ray luminosities ( @xmath5 erg s@xmath3 ) .",
    "even if we knew nothing about the completeness of this subsample , the observed 25 clusters ( where 57 are expected ) already limit any negative evolution to about a factor of two . if the estimated incompleteness of this subsample is taken into account ( r.a .",
    "range not yet fully covered , softer x - ray sources not yet screened , etc ) , we expect to eventually find 43 of the predicted 57 clusters .",
    "when the statistical and systematic errors of measurement and prediction are taken into account , the difference of about 15 clusters is statistically not significant .",
    "our tentative conclusion is that there is no significant evolution of the x - ray cluster luminosity function out to @xmath6 at any luminosity .",
