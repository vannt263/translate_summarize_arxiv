    "the inferred surface magnetic field is @xmath9  g derived under the assumption of a dipolar magnetic field .",
    "the measurement of the pulsar braking index @xmath10 shows that this assumption is reasonable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we confirm that the @xmath0-ray emission from the pwn is dominated by the inverse compton scattering of the ir photons from interstellar dust grains with a radiation density fixed at 1.4  ev  @xmath16 , which is the nominal value of the galprop isrf . here , the contribution of the optical photon field is negligible because of the klein - nishina effect @xcite .",
    "the nature of the break energy @xmath27 remains unclear .",
    "a radiation cooling break which is dominated by the synchrotron loss in this leptonic scenario is a primary candidate . with the assumed magnetic field ( @xmath28 g ) and",
    "system age ( @xmath29  kyr ) , the break energy can be calculated using standard formulae in @xcite as @xmath30 24  tev leading to a break in the photon spectrum at @xmath31 0.2  kev . even considering the limit of the one - zone approximation and potential uncertainty in the parameters obtained ,",
    "the fitted value of 460  gev , which predicts a break in the photon spectrum at @xmath32  ev , is much lower than the expected value .",
    "however , the photon index change @xmath33 is compatible with the prediction by the usual synchrotron cooling @xmath34 .",
    "one should note that the synchrotron break in this pulsar wind nebula is expected to occur just below the x - ray band and no hints of a break have yet been observed .",
    "more likely , this break energy could be an intrinsic characteristic of the electron spectrum injected in the pwn as suggested by @xcite , though @xmath35 is expected .",
    "another possibility would be that the spectral break of electrons may correspond to the energy scale where the electron acceleration mechanism switches , for instance , from magnetic reconnection @xcite to the usual first - order fermi acceleration .",
    "however , while @xcite indeed predict an index of unity , the production of an index harder than 2 is explained with difficulty by fermi acceleration .",
    "the total energy psr  b1509@xmath158 can supply to its pwn is strongly dependent on its initial spin period @xmath36 , which is generally unknown , as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the moment of inertia of the neutron star .",
    "@xmath36 can be analytically calculated for an ideal case , assuming that @xmath39 and @xmath40 are constant in the braking equation @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "using the standard parameters of the pulsar psr  b1509@xmath158 ( period of 150 ms , period derivative of @xmath42 and braking index @xmath43  @xcite ) , we obtain @xmath44 16  ms and @xmath45  ergs . knowing that the fit requires a total injected energy ( i.e. integrated electron energies above 1  gev ) of @xmath46  ergs , @xmath47 of @xmath48 should be converted into the current kinetic energy of electrons .",
    "the equipartition magnetic field strength can be estimated as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a volume of the emission region .",
    "assuming a spherical region of radius @xmath51 , we obtain @xmath52@xmath17 g . in the case of the considered source where @xmath51  @xmath18 10  pc , the pwn is particle dominated as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the extension of the he @xmath0-ray emission is of particular interest to better estimate the boundary of the pwn .",
    "we also consider a @xmath53 decay model , assuming a proton spectrum described by a power - law with a cut - off to fit the data points , though there are few theoretical indications supporting an injection of such hard protons .",
    "we obtain an index of protons of 1.9 with a cut - off energy of of 60  tev , which yields the accumulated energy of protons above 1  gev of @xmath54 ergs , where @xmath40 is a number density of target nuclei .",
    "this scenario is highly disfavoured from the energetics : even with a very high density of @xmath55  @xmath16 as mentioned by @xcite for the northwest limb of msh 15@xmath152 , the energy required would significantly exceed the total energy that the pulsar can supply to its nebula ( @xmath56  ergs ) .",
    "we report the detection of pulsed high energy @xmath0-rays from psr  b1509@xmath158 below 1  gev and extended emission from its pwn in msh  15@xmath152 up to 100  gev using 1 year of survey data with _ fermi_-lat .",

    "the @xmath0-ray pulse located at phase 0.33  @xmath2  0.02 is coincident with the main peak observed in x- and soft @xmath0-rays @xcite .",
    "the second peak detected at phase 0.96  @xmath2  0.01 may correspond to the marginal detection reported by @xcite in the 10  30  mev energy range covered by egret .",
    "the high - altitude emission models have problems explaining the peak separation measured with _",
    "fermi _ and the radio peak lagging the first @xmath0-peak . a confirmation of a possible precursor in the 1351 mhz radio profile",
    "@xcite might change this interpretation .",
    "the 2  @xmath14 upper limits derived below 1  gev confirm the spectral break of psr  b1509@xmath158 in the 10  30  mev energy range .",
    "more data are needed to measure the pulsar spectrum in the lat energy range .",
    "such estimates can help constrain the shape of the spectrum from x- to @xmath0-rays and disentangle between the emission models in the magnetosphere of psr  b1509@xmath158 . both the high - altitude models",
    "@xcite and the polar cap model @xcite can accommodate the severe spectral break and the low _ fermi _ limits .",
    "details such as the break energy and/or x - ray spectral shape are not exactly met .",
    "the extended @xmath0-ray emission observed by the lat above 1  gev is spatially coincident with the pwn powered by psr  b1509@xmath158 .",
    "its morphology is well modeled by a uniform disk or a gaussian distribution .",
    "the lat spectrum of the pwn above 1 gev is well described by a power - law with a photon index of ( 1.57 @xmath2 0.17 @xmath2 0.13 ) and a flux above 1 gev of ( 2.91 @xmath2 0.79 @xmath2 1.35 ) @xmath3  @xmath57  s@xmath5 .",
    "lat analyses of the pwn in msh  15@xmath152 bring new elements to the discussion on the emission models responsible for the high to very high emission from this source . the hadronic @xmath0-ray scenario is highly disfavoured by the new lat observations , as suggested by previous tev observations @xcite .",
    "the multi - wavelength spectrum can be explained by synchrotron and inverse compton processes , assuming a broken power - law spectrum for the electrons .",
    "the spectral break , constrained by multi - wavelength observations , is likely due to an intrinsic break of electrons injected from the pulsar wind .",
    "about 4  % of the pulsar s loss of rotational energy would be required to power the @xmath0-rays detected by the lat , well in the range observed for other pulsar wind nebulae .",
    "more data are required to estimate the detailed morphology of the high energy @xmath0-ray emission and better constrain the spectral break in the inverse compton component .",

    "<S> we report the detection of high energy @xmath0-ray emission from the young and energetic pulsar psr  b1509@xmath158 and its pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) in the composite supernova remnant snr  g320.4@xmath11.2 ( aka msh  15@xmath152 ) . using 1 year of survey data with the _ fermi_-large area telescope ( lat ) , we detected pulsations from psr  b1509@xmath158 up to 1 gev and extended @xmath0-ray emission above 1 gev spatially coincident with the pwn . </S>",
    "<S> the pulsar light curve presents two peaks offset from the radio peak by phases 0.96 @xmath2 0.01 and 0.33 @xmath2 0.02 . </S>",
    "<S> new constraining upper limits on the pulsar emission are derived below 1 gev and confirm a severe spectral break at a few tens of mev . the nebular spectrum in the 1  100 gev energy range is well described by a power - law with a spectral index of ( 1.57 @xmath2 0.17 @xmath2 0.13 ) and a flux above 1 gev of ( 2.91 @xmath2 0.79 @xmath2 1.35 ) @xmath3  @xmath4  s@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the first errors represent the statistical errors on the fit parameters , while the second ones are the systematic uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> the lat spectrum of the nebula connects nicely with cherenkov observations , and indicates a spectral break between gev and tev energies . </S>"
