    "the measurement of weak gravitational lensing produced by the large - scale structures in the universe ( hereafter , the cosmic shear ) is potentially the most effective , albeit challenging , step toward a direct mapping of the dark matter distribution in the universe at intermediate and low redshift . unlike several popular probes of large - scale structures , lensing maps the dark matter directly , regardless of the distribution of light emitted by gas and galaxies or the dynamical stage of the structures analysed .",
    "a decade of theoretical and technical studies has shown that the gravitational distortion produced by the structures along the lines - of - sight contains important clues on structure formation models ( see @xcite , @xcite for reviews and references therein ) . from these studies , we know that weak lensing can provide measurements of cosmological parameters and the shape of the projected density power spectrum ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is also clear that the most challenging issues are observationals , because the measurement of extremely weak gravitational distortions is severely affected by various sources of noise and systematics such as the photon noise , the optical distortion of astronomical telescopes and the atmospheric distortion .",
    "therefore , the problem of reliable shape measurement has also received much attention in the last few years ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    despite considerable difficulties in recovering weak lensing signals",
    ", the potential cosmological impact of the cosmic shear analysis has motivated several teams to devote efforts on imaging surveys designed for the measurement of the galaxy distortion produced by gravitational lensing , either by observing many independent small fields , like the vlt / fors - i ( maoli et al in preparation ) , the hst / stis ( @xcite ) , the wht ( @xcite ) , or by observing few intermediate to large fields , like the cfht / cfh12k - uh8k ( this work and @xcite ) , the sdss ( @xcite ) and other ongoing surveys . in this paper",
    "we present the results of the analysis based on 2 square degrees obtained during previous independent observing runs at the cfht with mixed i and v colors .",
    "this study is part of a our weak lensing survey carried out at cfht ( hereafter the descart project ) which will cover 16 square degrees in four colors with the cfh12k camera .",
    "though the survey is far from completion , data obtained during previous runs have been used jointly with the first observations of the descart survey that we did in may 1999 and in november 1999 in order to demonstrate that the technical issues can be overcome and to better prepare the next observations .",
    "this set of data permits us already to report on the detection of a cosmic shear signal .",
    "+ in the following , we discuss the technique used to extract the cosmological signal and to measure its amplitude and show that systematic effects are well under control .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes our data sets .",
    "section 3 discusses the details of our psf correction procedure and section 4 presents the final results .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the discussion of the residual systematics and their correction .",
    "section 6 presents a preliminary quantitative comparison of our signal with numerical expectations of cosmological scenarios as derived from ray - tracing simulations .",
    "conclusions are given in section 7 .",
    "the difficulty to get a wide angle coverage of the sky in good conditions is the reason why there is not yet a clear detection of cosmic shear . for this work",
    ", we decided to get the widest angular field possible , which was done at the expense of homogeneity of the data set .",
    "however this does not impact our primary goals which are the detection of a weak lensing signal and the test of the control of systematics .",
    "+ we use in total eight different pointings mixing cfh12k and uh8k data sets ( see table [ fields ] ) .",
    "they are spread over five statistically independent areas , each separated by more than 10 degrees .",
    "the total field covers about @xmath11 , and contains @xmath12 galaxies ( with a number density @xmath13 gal / arcmin@xmath4 ) .",
    "note that the galaxies are weighted as discussed in section 2.2 , and parts of the fields are masked , so the effective number density of galaxies is about half .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ simul ] shows the two simulations we used . the @xmath14cdm model with @xmath10",
    "is not an independent simulation , but was constructed from the @xmath14cdm model with @xmath15 simply by dividing @xmath16 by @xmath17 .",
    "this should empirically mimic a model with both @xmath18 and @xmath19 equal to one .",
    "the redshift of the sources is equal to @xmath20 , which is not appropriate for our data .",
    "however , for the depth of the survey , we believe that it represents fairly well the mean redshift of the galaxies , which is the dominant factor in determining the second moment .",
    "figure [ 9700.f10.ps ] shows the amplitude and the scale dependence of the variance of the shear for the three cosmological models , compared to our signal .",
    "it is remarkable that models ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) can be marginally rejected ( we did not plot the error bars due to the intrinsic ellipticity for clarity : they can be obtained from figure [ 9700.f8.ps ] ) .",
    "our measurements are in agreement with the cluster normalized model ( 2 ) . also plotted is the theoretical prediction of a @xmath21cdm model , with @xmath7 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and a redshift of the sources @xmath24 .",
    "it shows that the low-@xmath25 model is also in good agreement with the data , which means that weak gravitational lensing provides cosmological constraints similar to the cluster abundance results ( @xcite,@xcite ) : the second moment of the shear measures a combination of @xmath19 and @xmath18 ( see equation [ vartheo ] ) .",
    "a measure of the third moment of the convergence would break the @xmath25-@xmath19 degeneracy , but this requires more data ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it should also be noted that for the simulations , we have considered cold dark matter models with shape parameter @xmath26 ; higher values of @xmath27 increase the theoretical predictions on scales of interest , e.g. the @xmath28 , @xmath10 model would be ruled out even more strongly .",
    "we conclude that our analysis is consistent with the current favored cosmological models , although we can not yet reject other models with high significance . since we have only analyzed 2 square degrees of the survey , with forthcoming larger surveys we should be able to set strong constraints on the cosmological models as discussed below .    due to the imprecise knowledge of the redshift distribution in our data",
    ", the interpretation might still be subject to modifications .",
    "the final state of our survey in 4 colors will however permit the measurement of this distribution by estimating photometric redshifts for the source galaxies .",
    "we have demonstrated the existence of a significant correlation between galaxy ellipticities from 0.5 to 3.5 arc - minutes scales .",
    "the signal has the amplitude and the angular dependence expected from theoretical predictions of weak lensing produced by large - scale structures in the universe .",
    "we have tested the possible contribution of systematic errors to the measured signal ; in particular we discussed three potential sources of spurious alignment of galaxies : overlapping isophotes of very close galaxies , star anisotropy and ccd line / column alignment .",
    "the first of these systematics is easy to deal with , simply by removing close pairs , although we may have decreased the signal slightly by removing them .",
    "the star anisotropy seems to be very well controlled , in part due to the fact that the bias adds quadratically with the signal .",
    "moreover , in the absolute sense , the bias does not exceed a fraction of 1 percent , which is adequate to accurately measure a variance of the shear of few percent .",
    "the only important bias we found seems to be associated with the ccd columns , and it is constant over the survey , it is therefore easy to correct for .",
    "the origin of this ccd bias is still unclear .    as an objective test of the reality of the gravitational shear signal , we measured the ellipticity correlation functions @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "while the measurement is noisy , the general behavior is fully consistent with the lensing origin of the signal .",
    "the tests for systematic errors and the three ellipticity correlation function measurements described above have led us to conclude with confidence that we have measured a cosmic shear signal .    with larger survey area",
    ", we expect to be able to measure other lensing statistics , like the aperture mass statistic ( @xmath32 ; see @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath32 statistic is still very noisy for our survey size because its signal - to - noise is lower than the top - hat smoothing statistic , due to higher sample variance ( we verified this statement using the ray tracing simulation data of @xcite ) .",
    "our survey will increase in size in the near future ( quickly up to @xmath33 square degrees ) , leading to a factor of 2 improvement in the signal - to - noise of the results presented here . according to our estimates",
    ", this will be enough to measure @xmath32 at the arc - minute scale with a signal - to - noise of @xmath34 .",
    "the detection of the skewness of the convergence should also be possible with the increased survey area",
    ". this will be important in breaking the degeneracy between the amplitude of the power spectrum and @xmath25 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these measures should also provide nearly independent confirmations of the weak gravitational lensing effect as well as additional constraints on cosmology .",
    "thus by combining different measures of lensing by large - scale structure ( top - hat smoothing statistics , @xmath32 statistics , correlation function analysis , power spectrum measurements ) , higher order moments , and peak statistics ( @xcite ) , from forthcoming survey data , we hope to make significant progress in measuring dark matter clustering and cosmological parameters with weak lensing .",
    "we also hope to do a detailed analysis with a more sophisticated psf correction algorithm .",
    "for instance , the mass reconstruction is linear with the amplitude of the residual bias , and a fraction of percent bias is still enough to prevent a definitive detection of filaments or to map the details of large scale structures .",
    "since we show elsewhere ( @xcite ) that such a bias is unavoidable with the present day correction techniques and image quality , there is still room to improve the analysis prior to obtaining accurate large - scale mass maps .",
    "recent efforts to improve the psf correction are very encouraging ( @xcite ) .",
    "we plan to explore such approaches once we get an essentially homogeneous data set on a larger field .",
