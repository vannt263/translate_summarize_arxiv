    "for instance , viscosity reduces the growth rate of the rayleigh - plateau instability in liquid jets @xcite and alters the size , number and speed of capillary waves in between interacting solitary waves on falling liquid films @xcite . due to the significantly higher dissipation of capillary waves compared to gravity waves , capillary waves occurring on the forward facing slope of gravity waves",

    "( [ eq : criticalwavenumberhoshino ] ) , which is derived from the weak damping assumption , to be in good agreement with their experimental measurements at water - air and glycerol - air interfaces .    the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : gammanorm ] suggest that , assuming the same cumulative properties @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 of the two - phase system , systems with high ratios of kinematic viscosity or density ( @xmath206 ) impose a smaller effective viscous damping than two - phase systems in which the ratios of kinematic viscosity and density are unity ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "hence , two - phase systems with @xmath200 , _ e.g. _  case d , require a higher wavenumber to oscillate with a certain dimensionless frequency @xmath165 or to exhibit critical damping .",
    "this explains the observed shift to higher wavenumbers in eq .",
    "( [ eq : criticalwavenumber ] ) for critical damping for two - phase systems with smaller @xmath138 .",
    "in order to characterize the frequency dispersion of capillary waves in viscous fluids , a rational parametrization based on a harmonic oscillator model has been proposed , from which a formulation for the critical wavenumber has been derived .",
    "this critical wavenumber has been shown to be a characteristic value of the frequency dispersion of capillary waves , as demonstrated by the consistent scaling of the undamped frequency @xmath188 as well as the damping rate computed with aivs and dns for representative two - phase systems .",
    "critical damping occurs when capillary and viscous timescales are in balance , a finding which may also apply to other damped oscillators , such as elastic membranes , in that critical damping occurs when suitably defined dispersive ( or restoring ) and dissipative timescales are in balance .",
    "the proposed scaling of capillary waves together with the critical wavenumber obtained from the proposed harmonic oscillator model has been shown to lead to a self - similar characterization of the frequency dispersion of capillary waves , irrespective of the fluid properties and throughout the entire underdamped regime .",
    "the identified similarity of the frequency dispersion allows to take , for instance , experimental measurements or results obtained with the aivs of @xcite for certain fluid properties and translating these results to any other two - phase system using the proposed scaling . since analytical solutions for simple reference cases are readily available , this similarity , thus , enables an accurate _ a priori _ evaluation of the frequency of a capillary wave in viscous fluids for any wavenumber .",
    "also , this similarity yields the conclusion that the wavenumber is a function of the viscocapillary lengthscale and the property ratio , @xmath208 , and the frequency is a function of the viscocapillary timescale , @xmath209 .",
    "the inviscid and weak damping assumptions , which are commonly used to describe the dispersion of capillary waves , have been shown to be inaccurate for high wavenumbers , close but below the critical wavenumber .",
    "with respect to the assumption of inviscid fluids , the presented results suggest this to be valid for wavenumbers @xmath210 .",
    "interestingly , the weak damping assumption provides a considerably more accurate description of two - phase systems in which the bulk phases have large density and viscosity ratios than for systems with similar bulk phases .",
    "a new definition of the damping rate based on the aivs and dns results has been proposed , which has been shown to yield a more accurate prediction of the frequency of capillary waves at high wavenumbers than estimates based on the inviscid and weak damping assumptions .",
