    "soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) are associated with supernova remnants and have multiple bursts of gamma - rays which distinguish them from gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) e.g. @xcite .",

    "several sgrs and anomalous x - ray pulsars have been found to be x - ray pulsars that have unusually high spin down rates .",
    "the rapid reduction in spin is usually attributed to magnetic breaking caused by the super - strong magnetic fields with values above 10@xmath4 g. in the magnetar model the magnetic field provides the burst energy @xcite .",
    "a common scenario is that stresses build up in the magnetic field and cause a quake in the crust of the neutron star which ejects plasma alfvn waves through the magnetosphere .",
    "grbs are non - recurrent catastrophic events that radiate @xmath110@xmath5 ergs in @xmath3-rays .",
    "there is substantial evidence that grbs are linked to supernova explosions e.g. @xcite .",
    "they are often modelled as accretion onto a newly formed black hole e.g. @xcite .",
    "recent measurements suggest that the @xmath3-rays are highly polarised by the magnetic field which may originate in the central engine with values of b above 10@xmath6 g @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to compare the pulse properties of sgrs and grbs .",
    "it has been noted that the lognormal distributions apply to the pulse properties of sgrs @xcite and grbs @xcite .",

    "the behaviour of bursting sources can be usefully compared with relaxation systems @xcite .",
    "a relaxation system is taken to be one that continuously accumulates energy from some process and discontinuously releases it .",
    "the energy in the reservoir at any time @xmath10 is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the energy stored in the reservoir that accumulates energy at a rate @xmath13 and discontinuously releases events of size @xmath14 .",
    "the simplest system is referred to as a relaxation oscillator where there is a fixed level or trip - point that triggers a release of the energy when e = e@xmath15 .",
    "the sgr and grb pulses are not consistent with this type of oscillator .",
    "more complicated behaviour occurs when the accumulation rate , trigger rate or release strength are not constant @xcite .",
    "if the system starts from a minimum level e = e@xmath16 , accumulates energy at a constant rate r = r , the sum of the releases is approximately a linear function of time i.e. @xmath17 .",
    "this model can account for the approximately linear increase in cumulative counts .",
    "the output from grbs and sgrs has a tendency to keep the cumulative count close to a linear function and maintain a steady state situation in a minority of bright grbs with many pulses it was found that the cumulative output increases with time as t@xmath18 in @xmath1 10% of bursts and as ( 1-t)@xmath18 in @xmath15% .",
    "this behaviour was attributed to a change in spin of the newly formed black hole @xcite .",
