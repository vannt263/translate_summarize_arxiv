    "the vortex state of cuprate superconductors is of central importance in understanding high-@xmath1 superconductivity ( htsc ) .",
    "one the most well studied quantities is the internal magnetic field distribution @xmath7 associated with the vortex lattice ( vl).@xcite as discussed below , several methods can be used to measure @xmath7 , which depends on the london penetration depth @xmath8 , the coherence length @xmath9,@xcite and , to a lesser extent , the internal structure of the vortices,@xcite and non - linear and non - local effects.@xcite the form of @xmath7 has a distinctive asymmetric shape due to the spatial magnetic inhomogeneity characteristic of an ordered two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattice of vortices .",
    "one basic feature in @xmath7 is a prominent high field tail associated with the vortex cores , which depends on the magnitude of @xmath9 .",
    "there is also a saddle point in the local field profile located between two vortices .",
    "this gives rise to a van hove singularity or sharp peak in @xmath7 below the average field .",
    "the overall width or second moment of @xmath7 depends primarily on the london penetration depth @xmath8 , the lengthscale over which the magnetic field is screened .",
    "anisotropy of the fermi surface or the superconducting order parameter can result in a different vl but the main features are similar for any ordered lattice.@xcite    another general feature associated with any real vl is disorder arising from vortex pinning at structural defects and impurities.@xcite structural defects are present in all superconductors to some degree , but may be more prevalent in structurally complex compounds such as ybco .",
    "for example , ybco s slightly orthorhombic structure facilitates crystal twinning , i.e. in a single crystal , there are generally domains with the nearly equal @xmath10 and @xmath11 directions interchanged . separating such twin domains",
    "are well defined 45@xmath12 grain boundaries or twin boundaries which have been shown to be effective extended vortex pinning sites.@xcite scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) imaging of a twinned ybco crystal show that the areal vortex density is strongly modified by the twin boundaries.@xcite small - angle neutron scattering ( sans ) studies of ybco confirm that the twin boundaries strongly deform the vl.@xcite understanding the influence of such structural defects on the vl has been the subject of intense theoretical work,@xcite and is important for two main reasons .",
    "firstly , it affects @xmath7 and thus adds uncertainty to measurements of fundamental quantities like @xmath8 and @xmath9 , since it can be difficult to isolate such extrinsic effects from changes in fundamental quantities of interest .",
    "secondly , the degree of pinning of vortices determines the critical current density which is important for many applications.@xcite    measurements of the vortex state field distribution @xmath7 are most often done using sans,@xcite nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr),@xcite and conventional muon - spin rotation ( @xmath13sr).@xcite all these methods probe the vl in the bulk and can be applied over a wide range of magnetic fields .",
    "it is also possible to probe the magnetic field distribution @xmath7 near the surface of the sample using low energy-@xmath13sr(le-@xmath13sr ) in low magnetic fields.@xcite recently we have demonstrated that similar information on @xmath7 near a surface can be obtained using @xmath0-nmr.@xcite this has the advantage that it can be applied over a wide range of magnetic fields .    in this paper , we report measurements of the vl above the surface of the cuprate superconductor yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4   using @xmath0-nmr.@xcite the @xmath14li@xmath6  beam was implanted into a thin silver overlayer evaporated onto several ybco samples . measuring in the ag allows one to isolate the contribution to @xmath7 from _ long wavelength disorder _ , i.e. disorder that occurs on length scales much longer than the vortex spacing and @xmath8 due to structural defects such as twin and grain boundaries .",
    "this is possible because the field distribution broadening just outside the superconductor due to the vl inside has a very distinctive field dependence . in particular",
    ", it vanishes in high magnetic fields where the vl spacing becomes less than the characteristic distance of the probe from the superconductor . on the other hand ,",
    "long wavelength disorder has a much weaker dependence on magnetic field and dominates the observed @xmath7 in the high field limit .",
    "our results show evidence for significant broadening of @xmath7 from such long wavelength disorder on the scale of @xmath15 , which is attributed to pinning at twin or other grain boundaries .",
    "the magnitude of the broadening is similar to that observed in bulk @xmath13sr  measurements , suggesting that the same broadening contributes to @xmath7 in bulk @xmath13sr  measurements .",
    "there is a crossover such that near @xmath1 , where @xmath16 , the broadening scales with the superfluid density , whereas at lower temperatures , where @xmath17 , the broadening does not track the superfluid density .",
    "we discuss the consequences of this for the inference of @xmath18 from measurements of @xmath7 in polycrystalline superconductors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii reviews the theory for the field distribution , and its second moment near the surface of a superconductor .",
    "section iii contains all the experimental details . in section iv , we present the results . finally in section v we discuss the results and draw conclusions .",
    "in a type ii superconductor , above the lower critical field @xmath19 , the magnetic field penetrates the sample _ inhomogeneously _ forming a lattice of magnetic vortices , each carrying a flux quantum , @xmath20 . in a perfect crystal ,",
    "intervortex interactions lead to a long - range ordered 2d lattice of vortices , usually of triangular ( hexadic ) symmetry.@xcite at the core of each vortex ( a cylinder of radius approximately the superconductor s coherence length @xmath9 ) , the local magnetic field is maximal . outside the core",
    ", concentric circulating supercurrents partially screen the field which thus falls exponentially with a lengthscale @xmath8 .",
    "the average magnetic field in the vl is the applied field @xmath21 for flat samples , where demagnetization effects are negligible.@xcite at a given field , the average vortex spacing , i.e. the lattice constant of the vl , @xmath10 is fixed . for the triangular lattice",
    "this is @xmath22 if one considers the profile of the magnetic field along a line in the lattice ( perpendicular to the direction of the applied field ) , it is thus _ corrugated _ with a period determined by @xmath10 .",
    "this inhomogeneity in the magnetic field causes a characteristic broadening in local magnetic resonance probes such as the muons in @xmath13sr or the host nuclei in nmr . since the muon ( or host nuclear spin ) is at a well - defined lattice site(s )",
    ", it samples the vl with a grid spacing given by the lattice constant of the crystal .",
    "since this is much smaller than the vl constant , the resulting field distribution @xmath7 provides a random sampling of the spatially inhomogeneous field @xmath23 over the vl unit cell : @xmath24 where the integral is over a unit cell of the vl of area @xmath25 . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the @xmath26-component of the magnetic field @xmath27 ( parallel to the @xmath28-axis of ybco samples ) , and refer to it simply as @xmath29 .",

[ simfig](a ) for @xmath73 0.3 and 0.6 mt , together with the ideally ordered vl ( @xmath64 ) .",

    "the vortices are spaced so closely ( @xmath151 nm ) , that there should be no detectable broadening from a regular vl for our stopping depths .",
    "this can be seen clearly from the simulation in fig .",
    "[ simfig](b ) , where the vl broadening approaches zero at high fields .",
    "in contrast , the data at 3.33 t shows significant broadening below @xmath1 which is therefore solely attributed to vortex disorder on a long length scale .",
    "the temperature dependence of the broadening is also much weaker than expected from a regular vl in ybco , where @xmath103 has a strong linear term due to the @xmath60-wave order parameter.@xcite the observed temperature dependence fits well to our model of disorder , where @xmath147 is compared to an estimate of the fwhm given by @xmath152 , where @xmath51 is given in eq .",
    "( [ scm - dvl ] ) .",
    "this leads to an estimate of @xmath54 of the order of a micron , consistent with the the separation between twin boundaries or grain boundaries.@xcite in the detwinned crystal , @xmath54 is found to be larger but not infinite since the detwinning is not complete .",
    "the fraction of vortices @xmath92 pinned by structural defects in the twinned crystal is about @xmath153 at low field ( 52 mt ) and decreases considerably at high field ( 3.33 t ) .",
    "thus , the amplitude of the enhanced vortex density at the defects , @xmath154 , varies between 2 - 4 mt at all fields . in the detwinned crystal , @xmath155 ,",
    "is an order of magnitude smaller than in the twinned crystal at the same field , with small variation in the vortex density ( 0.5 mt ) compared to the twinned crystal .",
    "these results are consistent with expectations from pinning at twin boundaries . in particular",
    ", one expects the fraction of vortices pinned will decrease in the partially detwinned crystals .",
    "also , it is reasonable to expect that in a high magnetic fields the fraction of vortices pinned will decrease due to the smaller separation between vortices and resulting increase in the repulsive interaction .    in fig .",
    "[ ybcosfig ] , the spectra in all three samples above and below @xmath1 are compared with the corresponding simulated field distributions .",
    "the observed lineshapes are all symmetric , and significantly broader than expected , showing little or no sign of the characteristic vl field distribution .",
    "simulation of the vl lineshapes ( dashed lines ) was done using eqs .",
    "( [ fourierb ] ) , ( [ bzr_eq ] ) , and ( [ pb ] ) , for @xmath62 nm , and was convoluted with a lorentzian representing the normal state spectra with @xmath156 mt . the theoretical lineshape for the film is broader and asymmetric because it is weighted by the @xmath14li@xmath6  stopping distribution which was on average closer to the superconductor .",
    "the lineshapes for the crystals are almost symmetric as the ideal vl lineshape at the depths of an average 90 nm away from the superconductor are narrower than the lorentzian they are convoluted with .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the superconducting linewidth @xmath147 at low temperatures @xmath142 4.5 - 10 k is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fwhmbfig ] . in all samples ,",
    "we find that the broadening is largest at low field and decreases gradually with increasing field .",
    "also , in all cases the broadening remains large and well above the prediction from a regular vl , approximated by @xmath157 where @xmath51 of an ideal vl is given in eq .",
    "( [ scm - vl ] ) and weighted by the @xmath14li@xmath6  profile given in fig .",
    "[ trimfig ] .",
    "the broadening is substantially smaller in the detwinned crystal compared to the other samples .",
    "one can account for all of the data using a linewidth due to a disordered vl , @xmath158 , where @xmath51 is now given in eq .",
    "( [ scm - dvl ] ) ) and weighted by the @xmath14li@xmath6  profile plotted in fig .",
    "[ trimfig ] .",
    "the data is well fitted ( see fig . [ fwhmbfig ] ) by assuming that the twin / grain boundaries spacing @xmath54 is sample dependent of the order of a few microns , and by assuming a phenomenological form for the fraction of pinned vortices @xmath98 with @xmath159 and @xmath99 sample dependent .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath0-nmr  lineshapes in the ag overlayer differ substantially from that expected from a well - ordered vl field distribution .",
    "this has little to do with the method of observation .",
    "for example , in the conventional superconductor nbse@xmath111 , @xmath0-nmr  shows the expected vl lineshape.@xcite the lineshapes reported here in the ybco film are also qualitatively different than that seen with le-@xmath13sr in a ybco film coated with a 60 nm thick ag layer.@xcite in that experiment the authors found a more asymmetric lineshape in the ag overlayer which was closer to that of a regular vl",
    ". some of this difference may be due to the different pinning characteristics of the samples , although the ybco film used by niedermayer _ et al . _",
    "was from the same source as sample iii .",
    "also , the le-@xmath13sr   experiment was probing the vl closer to the interface and in a lower applied field where the disorder is less important compared to the contribution from the ordered vl .",
    "the symmetry and large broadening of the lineshape at low fields can not be accounted for by vl melting ( at a reentrant vortex liquid state near @xmath19 ) which would instead yield a motional narrowing of the field distribution.@xcite    the observed resonances in the current experiment are dominated by long range variations of the vortex density across the face of the sample.@xcite such disorder in the vl can produce a symmetric lineshape,@xcite and can broaden the field distribution significantly compared to that of the corresponding ordered state.@xcite weak random pinning or point - like disorder due to oxygen deficiency may slightly distort the vl , and may also broaden the lineshape.@xcite however , the correlated disorder due to the twin and grain boundaries is dominant at long wavelengths , @xcite and therefore we are mostly sensitive to the twin / grain boundaries .",
    "indeed , the position of the probe outside the superconductor enhances its sensitivity to long wavelength disorder , as the proximal fields fall off with distance as @xmath160 where @xmath54 is the wavelength of the inhomogeneity of the field.@xcite the broadening is reduced in a detwinned crystal where the twin boundaries are more sparse as shown in fig .",
    "[ ybcosfig ] , thus the vortex density variation across the face of the sample is smaller than in the twinned crystals as @xmath92 is largely reduced .",
    "the extrinsic broadening due to disorder at low temperature , @xmath161 , reported here is between 0.5 mt and 2.5 mt .",
    "this is remarkably close to the additional gaussian broadening required to explain lineshapes in bulk @xmath13sr  measurements on crystals.@xcite in the bulk , this extrinsic broadening is small compared to the intrinsic vl broadening , whereas outside the sample the reverse is true .",
    "it is important to note the @xmath104-dependence of the extrinsic broadening in fig .",
    "[ fwhmfig ] _ does not follow the superfluid density _ ( @xmath162 ) which varies linearly at low-@xmath104 because of the @xmath60-wave order parameter.@xcite instead , we observe a much weaker @xmath104-dependence .",
    "this is expected from our model of disorder which occurs on a long length scale @xmath54 .",
    "for example , at low-@xmath104 where @xmath8 is short compared to @xmath54 , the flux density outside the sample is determined solely by inhomogeneities in the vortex density , and is independent of the superfluid density as the vortices are static and well - pinned in the twin boundaries .",
    "the current results may also explain early @xmath13sr   work on htsc powders and sintered samples which mistakenly indicated an @xmath105-wave @xmath104-dependence of @xmath103.@xcite it is likely in these cases the linewidth was dominated by extrinsic vl disorder on a long length scale .",
    "this tends to flatten the @xmath104-dependence of the linewidth and the effective @xmath8 obtained from the analysis.@xcite therefore we conclude that although the linewidth obtained from powders can be useful in making rough estimates of @xmath8 , one can not extract accurate measurements of @xmath8 or its @xmath104-dependence without additional information about the source of broadening and in particular vl disorder .    in conclusion , we have measured the magnetic field distributions due to the vortex state of ybco using @xmath0-nmr .",
    "we find a significant inhomogeneous broadening of the nmr attributed to the underlying vl in ybco .",
    "however , the observed resonances have several unexpected properties .",
    "in particular , they are broader and more symmetric than for an ideal vl .",
    "the anomalous broadening is most evident in high field where there is no significant contribution from the regular vl .",
    "these effects are attributed to long wavelength disorder from pinning at twin or grain boundaries .",
    "the temperature dependence of the disorder - related broadening does not scale with @xmath103 , suggesting there is a contribution to the linewidth in the bulk of the vortex state that does not track the superfluid density .",
    "this is likely to have only a minor effect on the interpretation of data on crystals where the observed lineshape is close to that expected from a well ordered vl .",
    "however , it can be significant in powders or crystals where there is substantial disorder in the vl .",
    "in particular , when the broadening is dominated by vl disorder on a long length scale ( i.e. much bigger than @xmath8 ) the temperature dependence of the linewidth does not scale with @xmath103 and therefore can not be used to determine the symmetry of the superconducting gap .",
