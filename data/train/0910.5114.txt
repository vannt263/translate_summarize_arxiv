    "the future optical / near - infrared european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ; see , e.g. , gilmozzi & spyromilio @xcite ) , which is designed with a 42-metre aperture , will offer a substantial improvement in angular resolution compared to existing facilities . at wavelengths @xmath3 m , diffraction - limited resolutions of @xmath4mas will be achieved . in terms of angular resolution in the near infrared",
    ", the e - elt will outperform existing 810m - class telescopes like the vlt or keck by factors of @xmath245 and the future james webb space telescope ( jwst ) by factors of @xmath27 .",
    "this increase in angular resolution should translate into a corresponding improvement in astrometric accuracy .    in order to exploit the e - elt s resolution , a german - dutch - italian - french consortium proposed the multi - ao imaging camera for deep observations ( micado ) in february 2008 .",
    "as the spatial resolution of any ground - based observatory is initially limited by the atmospheric seeing , micado will be equipped with a multi - conjugate adaptive optics ( mcao ) system for achieving the diffraction limit of the 42m - telescope .",
    "this system uses three natural and six laser guide stars for correcting the atmospheric turbulence in a wide ( @xmath5 ) field of view ( diolaiti et al .",

    "@xcite ) is foreseen .    in order to achieve its science goals ( see sect .  2 for details ) , micado needs to reach a stable ( time scales of years ) astrometric accuracy of approximately 50@xmath1as . at present 810 m class telescopes , accuracies of @xmath20.5% of a resolution element",
    "can be reached regularly ( e.g. fritz et al .",
    "therefore from simple scaling of results our goal _ a priori _ appears reasonable .",
    "however , at levels of the order of 100@xmath1as there are several sources of statistical and systematic errors which need to be taken into account carefully . in this article",
    "we discuss those effects and analyse strategies to bypass them .",
    "we conclude that reaching an astrometric accuracy of better than 50@xmath1as is highly challenging in terms of instrument design and data calibration but feasible .",
    "micado s astrometric performance should be of the same magnitude as that of the future astrometry space mission gaia ( e.g. jordan @xcite ) .",

    "the improvement in detail and depth is obvious.,title=\"fig:\",height=332 ]    although this study is set up for the specific case of micado , most of its results are valid in general and therefore of interest beyond the e - elt community .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "we discuss the science cases identified for micado . in section  3 , we review the concepts and techniques of accurate astrometry . in section  4 ,",
    "we identify and analyse sources of systematic errors one by one and describe methods for minimizing those errors .",
    "we provide a summary of our results and an overall error budget in section  5 and present our conclusions in section  6 .",
    "as part of the instrument design study , the micado collaboration has identified and analysed ( renzini et al .",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) several science cases for which the high astrometric accuracy of e - elt / micado is crucial and promises major discoveries .",
    "we discuss them in the following one - by - one .      located at a distance of @xmath28  kpc , the nuclear region of the milky way is the closest galactic nucleus , hosting the supermassive black hole ( @xmath10 ) sgr  a * ( e.g. gillessen et al .",
    "it is therefore a unique laboratory for exploring the regime of strong gravity , accretion onto black holes , and the co - evolution of dense star clusters and active galactic nuclei .",
    "present - day nir instrumentation , e.g. vlt / naco , provides astrometric accuracies down to @xmath20.3  mas and angular resolutions down to @xmath250  mas ( e.g. fritz et al .",
    "@xcite ) . this allowed to identify several stars on keplerian orbits around sgr  a * with orbital periods down to @xmath215 years and pericenter distances as small as @xmath2100  au ( @xmath212  mas on sky ; e.g. gillessen et al .",
    "it made possible to study in detail the kinematics and the composition of the nuclear star cluster in the gravitational potential of the central black hole . with e - elt / micado",
    "one can expect to achieve sensitivities that are more than five magnitudes fainter than for vlt / naco .",
    "angular resolutions and astrometric accuracies should also improve by factors of about five , meaning that proper motions of order 10@xmath1as / yr ( 400  m / s ) can be detected within few years of observations .",
    "such instrumental performance is necessary in order to adress several new questions ( e.g. gillessen et al .",
    "@xcite ) :    * identification of stars on closeby keplerian orbits with periods of few years .",
    "* measuring the _ prograde _ relativistic orbit precession and testing other effects of general relativity . *",
    "probing possible _ retrograde _ orbit precession due to an extended mass component built from compact stellar remnants .",
    "* analyzing the various separate kinematic structures of the nuclear star cluster , and searching for new ones . * quantifying the binary star fraction in the nuclear cluster .",
    "with micado , this type of analysis can be extended to other nearby galaxies .",
    "one obvious example is the core of m31 which hosts a @xmath11 black hole .",
    "similar to the case of the milky way , m31 s nucleus shows several distinct stellar populations : a triple nucleus and two nested star disks around the central black hole have been identified ( bender et al .",
    "although m31 is more distant from earth by a factor @xmath2100 compared to the galactic center , the larger mass of its black hole ( by a factor of @xmath235 ) causes stellar proper motions of about 6% compared to those in the nuclear cluster of the milky way . therefore kinematic analyses analoguous to the galactic center experiment will require capabilities as predicted for e - elt / micado .",
    "another example is centaurus  a which hosts a @xmath12 black hole ( neumayer et al .",
    "@xcite ) . given its distance of @xmath25  mpc , proper motions of @xmath210@xmath1as / yr correspond to @xmath2200  km / s .",
    "thus measuring the motions of stars in the vicinity of the black hole is possible .",
    "other galaxies might be interesting targets as well .",
    "the expected high astrometric accuracy of micado opens a new window in the search for and analysis of intermediate mass black holes ( imbh ) , objects with masses of few thousand solar masses . in the last years , the detection of those objects in the arches cluster ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the star association gcirs13 in the galactic center ( e.g. maillard et al .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath13  cen ( noyola et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and other locations has been claimed .",
    "most of these analyses are based on radial velocity dispersion profiles .",
    "this introduces systematic ambiguities as anisotropic velocity dispersions can mimick the presence of central point masses ; this one can see for example in the anisotropy term in the jeans equation .",
    "therefore reliable ( non)detections of imbhs require measurements of stellar proper motions ( e.g. anderson & van der marel @xcite ) .",
    "typical velocity dispersions @xmath14 of star clusters are of the order 10  km / s .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath250@xmath1as / yr at a distance of 40  kpc , meaning that for most of the galactic star clusters a proper motion analysis is feasible with micado only .",
    "this allows    * contraining black hole masses in galactic star clusters within few years , * probing the low - mass end of the @xmath15 relation , * testing the dynamical evolution of star clusters .",
    "as discussed above , the astrometric accuracy of micado should allow measuring stellar proper motions of few km / s for most galactic globular clusters .",
    "additionally , direct measurements of cluster parallaxes become possible : for a distance of 40  kpc , the full parallax displacement is 50@xmath1as , corresponding to micado s predicted astrometric accuracy .",
    "this allows adressing several topics :    * the spatial distribution of globular clusters . *",
    "cluster proper motions and their orbits around the milky way ( e.g. bedin et al .",
    "* internal cluster kinematics , including rotation . * separating cluster members from field stars , thus making analyses of cluster star populations more reliable ( see also anderson et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "cold dark matter models predict high mass densities and cuspy density profiles for the central regions of galaxy halos .",
    "in contrast , warm dark matter models predict substantially lower central densities and constant density cores at small radii .",
    "the dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies of the milky way provide a unique laboratory to test those models .",
    "their proximity of @xmath2100  kpc makes it possible to resolve individual stars and analyze their dynamics in the gravitational potentials of their galaxies .",
    "present day studies are usually based on line - of - sight velocity dispersion profiles . however , there are degeneracies of velocity dispersion anisotropies with mass density profiles",
    ". therefore any conclusive analysis requires measuring all three components of the velocity vectors of the tracer stars ( e.g. strigari et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "this type of studies requires accurate proper motion measurements with uncertainties of few km / s or better .",
    "micado will be able to provide accuracies of @xmath25  km / s within few years of observations for targets about 100  kpc away .",
    "this makes micado a decisive tool for testing the validity of present - day dark matter models .",
    "throughout this paper , we use the term `` astrometry '' the following way .",
    "we discuss time - resolved _ relative _ positions , meaning the positions of a science target with respect to a set of reference sources .",
    "science target and reference sources are located in the field of view ( fov ) of the camera , i.e. they are recorded simultaneously in the same science image .    _",
    "_ intra-__epoch measurements cover timelines that are so short that intrinsic motions of science targets or reference sources can not be detected . this can be a set of images taken within the same night or a few adjacent nights .",
    "any variations in measured positions are due to measurement errors and can be used to determine the position accuracies .",
    "all information obtained from this data set ( i.e. images , coordinates , ... ) can be combined , e.g. for improving the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .    _",
    "_ inter-__epoch measurements cover timelines sufficient for detecting source motions .",
    "those data can not be combined in a straight forward manner .",
    "intrinsic source motions and measurement errors interfere and need to be disentangled , usually meaning that calculating errors requires additional information . given micado s proper motion accuracies of @xmath250@xmath1as / yr or better ( depending on the duration of the experiments ) ,",
    "corresponding to @xmath210  km / s at 40  kpc distance , intrinsic motion of galactic stars is detected easily .",
    "therefore it will be necessary to use extragalactic sources , including high redshift objects like qsos , as references for some science cases .",
    "if a set of science images is at hand , the general analysis recipe is as follows .",
    "_ step 1_. from each image @xmath16 , one extracts the detector positions @xmath17 of all sources of interest ( science targets and reference sources ) .",
    "detector positions need to be measured with high accuracies of order few milli - pixels ( mpix ) .",
    "existing centroiding , source profile fitting , and point spread function ( psf ) correlation algorithms provide such accuracies ( e.g. diolaiti et al .",
    "@xcite ; berry & burnell @xcite ; trippe @xcite ) .",
    "_ step 2_. for each image @xmath16 , the detector positions @xmath17 need to be converted into global astrometric coordinates @xmath18 .",
    "the reference frame can be the detector coordinates of a selected zero - point image or any more general astrometric coordinate system . using the detector positions of the reference sources @xmath19 and their astrometric positions @xmath20 ,",
    "one calculates a transformation    @xmath21    obtaining the positions @xmath20 requires some prior knowledge on the reference sources .",
    "one powerful approach is cross - calibration with other datasets , maybe from other wavelength regimes .",
    "a nice example is given by reid et al .",
    "they use precise vlbi astrometry of sio maser stars in order to define an astrometric reference frame in k - band images of the galactic center .",
    "if the reference sources are known to be not moving ( e.g. extragalactic objects ) , one can set @xmath22 ; the index 0 indicates the selected zero - point in time .",
    "the same can be done if the reference source ensemble is ( or is defined as being ) at rest _ in average _ ,",
    "i.e. @xmath23 ( e.g. a sufficiently large set of stars in a star cluster ) . in this case",
    "however , one will loose information on a global motion ( drift , rotation , contraction , etc . ) of the combined system `` science target @xmath24 reference sources '' . in any case",
    ", the transformation @xmath25 is used to compute global astrometric coordinates for the science targets like    @xmath26    commonly , low - order ( @xmath85 ) 2-dimensional polynomial coordinate transformations    @xmath27    are used . in case prior knowledge on the geometry of the required transformation is available , one can use models with smaller numbers of free parameters ( e.g. montenbruck & pfleger @xcite ; anderson et al .",
    "@xcite ; trippe et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the number of available reference sources governs the maximum order of coordinate transformations ( see step 2 ) .",
    "a 1st order polynomial transform with six parameters requires three reference sources , i.e. @xmath28 coordinates . a 2nd - order transform ( 12 parameters ) requires six reference sources , and so on . throughout this paper",
    "we assume that _ any two science images need to be connected via full astrometric transformations_. this means that we regard more simple methods of data combination like stacking , simple - shift - and - add etc .",
    "as non - astrometric and thus not usable for our purpose .    in order to judge the astrometric accuracy achievable with a system like micado",
    ", one has to distinguish statistical and systematic influences .",
    "the _ statistical _ measurement accuracy is given by    @xmath29    here @xmath30 is the wavelength , @xmath31 the telescope aperture , and @xmath32 the signal - to - noise ratio ( lindegren @xcite ) . to give an example for the case of the e - elt : with @xmath33 m ( k - band ) , @xmath34 m , and @xmath35 , one obtains a statistical astrometric accuracy @xmath36as . from this",
    "we see that  in principle ",
    "astrometric accuracies of @xmath010@xmath1as can be obtained with the e - elt .",
    "this means that any source of additional , especially _",
    "systematic _ error needs to be compensated down to this level if one actually wants to fully exploit the e - elt s capabilities .",
    "in total , we have identified ten effects that might have the potential to reduce the expected astrometric accuracy of micado substantially .",
    "we will discuss these `` terrible ten '' in the following subsections .",
    "the first three phenomena we analyze are instrumental , the next five are atmospheric , and the last two are astronomical .      the detector position of a point source can be computed only if the source psf is sufficiently sampled .",
    "if the pixel scale  expressed in angular units per pixel  is too large ( undersampling ) , position information is lost because there is no unique mathematical description for the psf profile anymore .",
    "especially , a psf can then be modelled by profiles with different centers of light ( i.e. different detector positions ) .",
    "this effect is known as the _ pixel phase error_. it can reach magnitudes of several tenths of a pixel , thus providing an important boundary condition for the instrument design .",
    "a detailed description of this phenomenon is provided by anderson & king @xcite .    in order to identify the critical pixel scale of micado ,",
    "we first created artificial psfs for each of the bands i , j , h , and k. we modelled each psf @xmath37 as a superposition of a 2-dimensional airy function @xmath38 and a 2d moffat profile @xmath39 like    @xmath40    for each psf , a stochastic optimization routineott/ + dpuser / history.html ] adjusted the parameter @xmath41 $ ] such that the resulting psf profile showed the proper strehl ratio .",
    "we took strehl ratio estimates for micado from preliminary e - elt adaptive optics ( ao ) system simulations ( liske @xcite ; m. kissler - patig _ priv .",
    "_ ) , the values are shown in table  [ tab_strehls ] .",
    ".strehl ratio estimates as obtained from preliminary simulations ( liske 2008 ; m. kissler - patig _ priv .",
    "the @xmath42 are the central wavelengths of the filters . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab_highz ]    from our analysis we conclude that the use of high-@xmath43 galaxies as astrometric calibrators is feasible at the level of @xmath220@xmath1as at integration times of about 10h .",
    "this number assumes the use of several thousand point - like star clusters as reference sources ( also assuming that such exist at intermediate to high redshift ) .",
    "cross - correlation of images might provide even better accuracies , but would require a sophisticated computational scheme that can actually provide full coordinate transforms .    in some cases , one might consider separating the intra - epoch and the inter - epoch calibration steps .",
    "firstly , one can use a small number of stars ( as discussed earlier , six may be sufficient ) for _ intra_-epoch ( frame - to - frame ) calibration .",
    "proper adding of images allows building up snr sufficient for detection of and position measurements on faint galaxies .",
    "secondly , one can use these galaxies for _ inter_-epoch calibration .      in section  3",
    "we have outlined the concepts of relative astrometry and coordinate transforms .",
    "these schemes make use of sets of reference positions @xmath20 in order to compute transformation matrices for the @xmath16-th dataset .",
    "however , all transformation and calibration steps we have discussed up to now are executed in image space , i.e. in units of pixels . after removing non - linear distortions from the data",
    ", one needs to calibrate the pixel scale _ as projected on sky _ in order to accurately convert measured positions and motions into angular units .",
    "we note that the projected pixel scales for the two coordinates @xmath44 may be different if the detector plane is tilted with respect to the focal plane .",
    "calculating the scaling factors requires astrometric reference points with known positions located in the target fov .",
    "the number of reference sources should be at least three in order to allow for a full linear transformation .",
    "fortunately , this calibration step needs to be executed only once for a selected `` master '' ( or `` zero '' ) image .",
    "all other images can be connected to the master image reference frame via coordinate transforms , including the proper scaling ( e.g. trippe et al .",
    "errors on the reference positions propagate into the positions and motions calculated from the data . for the fov of micado , reference position accuracies of order 1  mas translate into a _ relative _ scaling accuracy of    @xmath45    as discussed in section  2 , the science cases for e - elt / micado demand accurate measurements of positions and proper motions over spatial scales from few ten @xmath1as ( e.g. parallaxes of globular clusters ; see sect .",
    "2.3 ) to few hundred mas ( e.g. stellar orbits around sgr  a * ; see sect .",
    "a relative pixel scale accuracy of @xmath46 corresponds to an error of 10  @xmath1as over an angular distance of 500  mas . from this",
    "we take the message that the accuracies of the reference positions should not exceed @xmath21  mas substantially .",
    "there are several possibilities for obtaining very accurate reference source positions .",
    "one of them is the use of sources located in the micado fov and visible in both nir and radio , e.g. qsos or maser stars . if radio - interferometric positions ( e.g. vlbi )  which are accurate on the sub - mas level  are at hand , the uncertainty on the pixel scale can be very low ( see , e.g. , reid et al .",
    "@xcite for the case of the galactic center ) .",
    "another option might be the use of stars from the hipparcos catalogue ( perryman et al .",
    "however , the uncertainties in stellar proper motions , which are @xmath20.8  mas / yr , will propagate into position uncertainties of @xmath220  mas over a timeline of 25 years ( given that the hipparcos catalogue reference epoch is j1991.25 ; perryman et al .",
    "this means that the astrometric uncertainties will exceed 10  @xmath1as if the spatial scale of the experiment is larger than @xmath225  mas .",
    "a more promising approach is the use of data from the future gaia astrometry space mission that will provide absolute astrometric accuracies well below 1  mas ( jordan @xcite ) .",
    "the main advantage of the gaia catalogue ( its high accuracies aside ) is the large number of stars included ",
    "@xmath210@xmath47  meaning that for any arbitrary field in the sky a sufficient number of reference points should be available .",
    "we conclude from our discussion that for micado sufficient numbers of calibration sources with absolute position accuracies better than 1  mas will be available .",
    "we therefore expect that the calibration of the projected pixel scale introduces errors of @xmath210@xmath1as at most .",
    "we have identified and discussed ten effects that might limit the expected astrometric accuracy of e - elt / micado observations systematically .",
    "we have been able to quantify each of these sources of error . from this",
    ", we can calculate a prediction for the error budget of micado .    1 .   for isolated point sources , _ detector sampling / binning _ does not introduce noticable ( @xmath21@xmath1as ) errors as long as the pixel scale does not exceed 3  mas / pix . for sources affected by crowding , using a smaller scale of 1.5  mas / pix can improve the accuracy by factors of about two compared to the 3  mas / pix case .",
    "therefore micado will use a pixel scale of 3  mas / pix as standard and a reduced scale of 1.5  mas / pix for mapping crowded fields . for the error budget",
    ", we can thus assume a sampling error + @xmath48 2 .",
    "instrumental _ geometric distortion _ needs to be taken into account by dedicated calibration procedures .",
    "we propose to implement a calibration mask into micado that illuminates the detectors with a well - defined image .",
    "such a mask would have to be mapped with accuracies of @xmath240 nm . based on our results in combination with published works using hubble space telescope data , we estimate that distortion can be corrected down to levels of @xmath21030@xmath1as . for the error budget , we therefore use + @xmath49 3 .   _ telescope instabilities _ , notably plate scale instabilities and instrumental rotations , are linear effects that can be absorbed by coordinate transforms .",
    "therefore they do not contribute to the error budget .",
    "atmospheric _ achromatic differential refraction _ is important ( order 10  mas ) only in linear terms which can absorbed by coordinate tranforms .",
    "higher - order contributions are of order 1@xmath1as , meaning for the error budget + @xmath50 5 .",
    "_ chromatic differential refraction _ introduces position errors of the order @xmath21  mas in nir observations depending on relative source colours .",
    "a tuneable zns / znse atmospheric dispersion corrector can reduce this effect to @xmath21020@xmath1as for `` typical '' science cases .",
    "extreme relative source colours might require the additional use of narrowband filters and/or analytic a posteriori correction schemes .",
    "for the error budget , we thus set + @xmath51 6 .",
    "ao _ guide star measurement errors _ for n natural guide stars can introduce distortions up to order n@xmath521 into images , meaning 2nd order distortions for the three ngs of micado . this effect can be absorbed by coordinate transforms ( of order n@xmath521 ) .",
    "it therefore does not contribute to the error budget .",
    "atmospheric _ differential tilt jitter _ can introduce errors of @xmath2100@xmath1as into diffraction - limited e - elt observations .",
    "it integrates out with @xmath53 . for micado which uses an mcao system ,",
    "the tilt jitter error can be integrated down to @xmath210@xmath1as within about 30 minutes of observation .",
    "using dedicated coordinate transform allows reaching this accuracy in shorter times . for the error budget , we thus set + @xmath54 8 .",
    "the _ anisoplanatism _ of the maory ao system introduces uncertainties of up to @xmath28@xmath1as .",
    "there appears to be no correlation of this error with the position of a psf in the fov ; it therefore can not be calibrated out in a straight forward manner",
    ". therefore we add it to the error budget : + @xmath55 9 .   depending on target field and science case , the use of _ galaxies as astrometric calibrators _ may be necessary . from a simulated micado deep field",
    "we find that we can use several thousand non - resolved galactic star clusters as point - like reference sources .",
    "however , good accuracies of @xmath220@xmath1as require long intra - epoch integration times of about 10 hours ; we consider this to be a somewhat large but realistic timescale .",
    "we therefore use for the error budget + @xmath56 10 . the accuracy of the _ sky - projected pixel scale _ is limited by the accuracy of astrometric positions of reference sources in the fov . given the typical accuracies of present - day radiointerferometric data and the future gaia catalogue , which are better than @xmath21  mas , we add to the error budget + @xmath57    from the individual uncertainties listed above we can calculate a total intrinsic astrometric accuracy for micado as    @xmath58    this number provides a systematic limit for astrometric accuracies to be expected from micado data .",
    "of course , this result corresponds to a somewhat arbitrary `` typical '' case . as many parameters like integration times , source colours , numbers and types of reference sources , etc . can vary over wide ranges , the actual @xmath59 for a specific observation can be quite different  in both directions  from the one we quote here .",
    "nevertheless , we conclude that we are able to quantify the mean systematic astrometric accuracy achievable with micado which is @xmath240@xmath1as .",
    "when discussing the accuracy of the measurement for a given target , one of course needs to add the statistical measurement error @xmath60 ( eq .  [ eq_accuracy ] ) which scales with the snr . for snr@xmath61100 , @xmath62as , and",
    "thus the combined error is @xmath63 .",
    "snrs different from 100 modify this number accordingly .",
    "in this article we have studied the capabilities expected for the nir imager micado for the future 42-m european extremely large telescope with respect to accurate astrometry .",
    "a variety of science cases requires long - term astrometric accuracies of @xmath250@xmath1as .",
    "we discuss and quantify ten effects that potentially limit the astrometric accuracy of micado .",

    "we find that astrometry at this accuracy level with micado requires the fulfillment of several conditions :    * all images , regardless of their distance in time , need to be combined via full coordinate transforms of second order or higher .",
    "* micado needs to be equipped with an astrometric calibration mask for monitoring the instrumental distortion .",
    "the pixel scale of the camera should not exceed the 3  mas / pix used in the current design .",
    "* astrometric observations require decent integration times of at least 30 minutes per epoch .",
    "this is unavoidable in order to average out atmospheric tilt jitter .",
    "when using high - z galaxies as astrometric reference points , integration times up to about 10 hours can be necessary .",
    "it is noteworthy that the effects discussed in this article already affect observations collected with present 8m - class telescopes . in his exhaustive analysis of nir images obtained with vlt / naco",
    ", fritz @xcite has been able to detect signatures of chromatic differential refraction and differential tilt jitter in his astrometric dataset .",
    "he concludes that taking into account these effects can improve the accuracies down to few hundred @xmath1as .",
    "this agrees with the findings of lazorenko @xcite and lazorenko et al .",
    "@xcite who analyze seeing - limited optical r - band ( @xmath65 nm ) images taken with vlt / fors1 + 2 .",
    "they conclude that they are able to achieve astrometric precisions ( but not accuracies ) of @xmath2100@xmath1as by using a special scheme for scheduling observations and dedicated coordinate transforms ( although they neglect instrumental geometric distortion ) .",
    "the analysis we provide here is set up for the specific case of e - elt / micado , but parts of our results are valid in general .",
    "this study should thus contain valuable information for other future 3040 m telescopes . as some of the effects we discuss",
    "are actually observed in present day 8m - class telescope data , our analysis might also be helpful for the calibration of data already taken .",
    "we therefore expect that our work is of interest well beyond the e - elt community .",
    "we are grateful to the members of the maory consortium for providing us with simulated mcao psfs .",
    "gratefully acknowledges support from the minerva program of the max - planck - gesellschaft .",
    "last but not least , we thank the anonymous reviewer whose comments were helpful to improve the quality of this article .",
