    "this paper continues a series of papers@xcite-@xcite investigating the connection between quantum entanglement and conditional information transmission ( a.k.a conditional mutual information , abbreviated cmi ) . in the last paper of that series",
    ", we expressed the entanglement of formation as a minimum of the quantum cmi . eureka ! in classical information theory , one of the preferred methods for numerically calculating extrema of mutual information is the arimoto - blahut algorithm @xcite-@xcite .",
    "one wonders whether something akin to that algorithm can be used to calculate entanglement .",
    "after much huffing and puffing , we have found the answer to be yes . in this paper",
    "we present our first results .",
    "more specifically , we present a new algorithm that yields the entanglement of formation of any bi - partite density matrix and a corresponding optimum decomposition of that density matrix . generalization of the algorithm to n - partite systems appears straightforward but we do not address it here .",
    "we also describe a c++ computer program called causa comn that implements the ideas of this paper .",
    "finally , we present some examples computed with causa comn .    prior to us , as far as we know , only one group of researchers@xcite has ever used a quantum version of the arimoto - blahut algorithm .",
