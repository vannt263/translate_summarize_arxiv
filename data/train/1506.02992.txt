    "granular materials behave differently from usual solids or fluids and show peculiar mechanical properties like dilatancy , history dependence , ratcheting and anisotropy @xcite .",

    "approaches that neglect the effect of elastic stored energy , i.e. ,  all the work done by the internal forces is dissipated , are also questionable . features visible in experiments , like wave propagation , can hardly be described without considering an elastic regime . in a general picture , both the deformations at contact and the irrecoverable rearrangements of the grains",

    "the former represents the elastic , reversible contribution to the behavior of the material .",
    "that is , for very small strain the response of a finite granular system in static equilibrium can be assumed to be linearly elastic @xcite , as long as no irreversible rearrangements take place . despite these arguments and the long - standing debate , basic features of the physics of granular elasticity are currently unresolved , like the determination of a proper set of state variables to describe the effective moduli .",
    "physical experiments carried out on sand and glass beads show that wave propagation in the aggregate depends upon the stress state and the volume fraction @xcite .",
    "recent works @xcite show that along with the macroscopic properties ( stress and volume fraction ) @xcite , also the fabric @xcite plays a crucial role , as it characterizes , on average , the geometric arrangement of contacts . due to preparation and loading path , the microstructure of granular aggregates is often far from isotropic and this is at the origin of interesting features in those materials .",
    "the mechanical behavior of anisotropic soils is a topic of current interest for both experimental and theoretical investigations .",
    "as one example , extensive experimental work of anisotropy has been carried out on laboratory - prepared ( by careful ` raining ' or bedding ) sand specimens @xcite .",
    "these and other studies show that the sample deformation characteristics depends highly on the orientation of the bedding plane with respect to the principal stress and strain axes @xcite on the other hand , when the material is sheared , anisotropy in the contact network develops , as related to the opening and closing of contacts , restructuring , and the creation and destruction of force - chains , affecting the material response . @xcite .",
    "most standard constitutive models , involving elasticity and/or plasticity have been applied to describe the incremental behavior of ( an)isotropic granular solids - sometimes with success , but typically only in a limited range of parameters . in the majority of the models ,",
    "the stress increment is related to the actual stress state of the granular system and its density .",
    "this is the case for hypoplasticity @xcite , where a single non - linear tensorial equation relates the jaumann stress - rate with strain - rate and stress tensors .",
    "only few theories after the pioneer work by cowin @xcite , consider explicitly the influence of the micro - mechanic structure on the elastic stiffness , plastic flow - rule or noncoaxiality of stress and strain , see @xcite and references therein . the evolution of microstructure due to deformations is an essential part of a constitutive model for granular matter because it stores the information how different paths have affected the mechanical state of the system . in this sense , fabric is a tensorial history variable .",
    "when included in the formulation , the effect of structure is often described by a fixed fabric tensor normal to the bedding plane of deposited sands @xcite .",

    "the anisotropy model proposed in @xcite postulates the split of isotropic and deviatoric stress , strain and fabric and includes the microstructure as a variable , whose behavior is described by an evolution equation independent of stress .",
    "@xcite predicts uniaxial simulation results under this assumption ( independent evolution of stress and structure ) , where the simplified model well captures the qualitative behavior .    in this work we use the discrete element method ( dem ) to study granular assemblies made of polydisperse frictionless particles and",

    "we aim to distinguish the kinematics at the microscale that lead to either macroscopic elasticity or plasticity .",
    "we analyze the role of microstructure , stress state and volume fraction on the evolution of the elastic moduli , with the goal to characterize them in terms of a unique , limited set of variables . in order to calculate the stiffness tensor",
    ", we apply small - strain probes to various equilibrium states along a volume conserving ( undrained ) shear deformation path . in the case of a finite assembly of particles , in simulations ,",
    "an elastic regime can always be detected and the elastic stiffnesses can be measured by means of an actual , very small , strain perturbation @xcite . the purpose is to improve the understanding of elasticity in particle systems and to guide further developments for new constitutive models . as an example , the relation between moduli and fabric here is used in the anisotropic constitutive model , as proposed in @xcite , to predict the macroscopic behavior during a more general deformation path , involving also strain reversal .",

    "both drop with a soft response from their respective saturation value and decrease with unloading strain , crossing their zero values at different strain levels , and finally reach their steady state with negative signs .",
    "this supports the need of independent descriptions for the evolution of stress and fabric .",
    "finally , re - loading is applied to reach the initial box configuration .",
    "the qualitative behavior of pressure @xmath125 is similar in simulations and model , going from a finite initial value to saturation with much less pronounced variations , since the deformation path is volume conserving .",
    "it is also interesting that the final state after the complete cycle , which corresponds to the initial box configuration , is highly anisotropic ( non - zero stress @xmath126 and deviatoric fabric @xmath108 ) .",

    "@xmath125 increases during loading @xmath106 by @xmath260 and saturates at large strains .",
    "after reversal , @xmath125 drops because of opening and release of contacts and then increases again with unloading strain .",
    "although @xmath125 is not quantitatively predicted by eqs .",
    "( [ eqnarray : delevolutionprop ] ) , the qualitative behavior is captured by the model , which requires a correction as proposed by krijgsman and luding @xcite .",
    "the concept of a history dependent jamming point , introduced by kumar _ _ et al .  _ _",
    "@xcite , is capable of capturing the behavior of @xmath125 quantitatively , however , this goes beyond the scope of this study .",
    "( [ eqnarray : delevolutionprop ] ) provide a set of equations able to describe the volumetric / deviatoric behavior of a granular assembly , in terms of stress and fabric .",
    "once the initial state and the deformation path are defined , the evolution of isotropic fabric can be determined ( using the coordination number and the fraction of rattlers ) along the deformation path .",
    "the knowledge of isotropic and deviatoric fabric and the incremental relations in eqs .",
    "( [ eqnarray : delevolutionprop ] ) allow for the definitions of the moduli at each incremental step .",
    "given also the probabilities for the plastic events ( @xmath261 and @xmath262 ) , the coupled system can be solved .",
    "that is , the characterization of the initial state is the information needed to fully describe the behavior of the material along a general deformation path , defined in terms of strain , since the incremental evolution equations for both stress and structure are given .    in the case of granular matter",
    ", the concept of a ( homogeneous ) material point in a continuum model is debated and many studies have been devoted to the introduction of a length scale in the constitutive model , starting from the cosserat brothers , see @xcite among others . here",
    "we limit ourselves and state that a finite - size system is always needed , in order to calibrate any continuum model .",
    "that is , any model interpretation works only between the upper / lower bounds of infinite system and particle scale . when a finite - size system is considered an elastic range",
    "can always be detected , such that rearrangements happen ( see section  [ sec : howsmall ] ) with negligible(tiny ) probability for very small strain , and an elasto - plastic framework could then make sense . here , we introduce a local rate - type model in eqs .",
    "( [ eqnarray : delevolutionprop ] ) , and identify elasticity as the unique initial , static , configuration , from which the ( incrementally irreversible ) evolution of stress and structure follows .",
    "our choice is to reduce elasticity to a `` punctual range '' , as plastic deformations ( which include irreversible opening / closing of contacts by large scale rearrangements ) will dominate for large deformations .",
    "dynamics and kinetic fluctuations , leading to relaxation , are not considered here , but also needs to be taken into account , see e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "in a triaxial box , the four elastic moduli that describe the incremental , elastic constitutive behavior of an anisotropic granular material in terms of volumetric / deviatoric components , namely the bulk modulus @xmath149 , the two anisotropic moduli @xmath236 and the octahedral shear modulus @xmath150 , can be measured by applying small strain perturbations to relaxed states that previously experienced a large strain , volume conserving ( undrained ) shear path .",
    "a connection between the macroscopic elastic response and the micromechanics is established , by considering both stress and fabric tensors , @xmath110 and @xmath263 , respectively .",
    "while the bulk modulus @xmath149 depends on the isotropic contact network @xmath138 , the deviatoric component of the fabric tensor @xmath108 is the fundamental state variable needed to properly model the ratios between the ( cross - coupling ) anisotropic and bulk moduli .",
    "when the deviatoric stress and strain are appropriately scaled ( normalized ) , we find that the moduli reduce to three relevant ones , i.e. @xmath264 . the anisotropy moduli are related to both deviatoric and isotropic fabric , as the whole contact network determines how the system will react to a perturbation .",
    "surprisingly , when the shear resistance @xmath150 is considered , both the contact network and the deviatoric stress determine the incremental behavior of the assembly .",
    "when the initial response is subtracted , the residual ratio @xmath265 scales with the deviatoric state of the system , through the product @xmath235 . for strain amplitude",
    "larger than @xmath266 , rearrangements in the sample take place and the behavior deviates from elastic ( reversible ) .",
    "the effect of increasing amplitude of isotropic / deviatoric strain perturbations on isotropic / deviatoric stress and fabric is investigated , in the case of nearly isotropic states and steady states at various different densities .",
    "for very small strain , the initial ( linear ) elastic regime , visible in the stress response , is associated to zero change in fabric . for higher strain amplitude applied to nearly isotropic state",
    ", plasticity comes into the play , and the incremental stress - strain relation deviates from linear as soon as the contact network changes . in the case of steady state , deviatoric strain",
    "can only induce fluctuations around the saturation value for both stress and fabric .",
    "large volumetric strain induce substantial modifications , as the sample previously subjected only to volume - conserving deformation , experiences now large volume changes . in the limit of large strain , the tangential moduli of the stress - strain and fabric - strain curves ( see fig .",
    "[ schematic ] ) are recovered .",
    "the relation between particle rearrangements and macro - scale plasticity is a present object of investigation , as well as the transition between local / global plastic regimes .",
    "as first important result , thanks to the independent study on elasticity , our study provides a new way to indirectly characterize the granular structure .",
    "once the moduli in a given isotropic / anisotropic configuration , have been measured through wave propagation experiments , they can be uniquely associated with the internal fabric .",
    "however , we do not expect the proportionality to remain constant for different materials .    as further step",
    ", a simple constitutive model is introduced that involves anisotropy , as proposed in refs .",
    "the non - linear elastic behavior is established and the irreversible/ plastic contribution is introduced via empirical probabilities for plastic events , that require more research and theoretical support .",
    "the dependence of the model parameters on volume fraction and polydispersity has been analyzed in previous extensive work @xcite . here , by using the new relations for the elastic moduli , we are able to integrate the increments at each state along a generic deformation path .",
    "hence we can predict the evolution of pressure , shear stress and fabric for large strain , and also at and after reversal . the method is first calibrated and then applied to a volume conserving ( undrained ) shear cycle .",
    "when the prediction is compared with numerical simulations , quantitative agreement is found for the deviatoric field variables .",
    "the most notable feature of soft but different reversal responses of shear stress and fabric is well captured ; the pressure response amplitude is underestimated by the present model .",
    "this study concerns a seemingly unrealistic material of spheres without friction and interacting with linear contact forces to exclude effects that are due to contact non - linearity , friction and/or non - sphericity .",
    "this allows to unravel the peculiar interplay of stress with microstructure .",
    "however , the work should be extended to more realistic cases involving particle shape , friction , and non - linear contact behavior .",
    "we expect that friction will not completely change qualitatively the observed relations between stiffness and fabric state , but possibly will add new effects to be explored in the future ; the deviatoric fabric and the moduli are expected to change quantitatively when tangential forces are included . on the other hand , non - linearity at contacts will introduce an extra pressure - dependence for the moduli , as already shown by many authors ( see e.g. @xcite in the case of hertzian interactions ) .",
    "speculating about the effects of shape goes beyond the scope of this study .",
    "a similar analysis is already in progress to check the influence of polydispersity on the relation between elastic stiffness and microstructure , as polydispersity affects the contact network , the structure , and the orientation of contacts @xcite .",
    "future work will focus on the extension of our small perturbation approach to elasto - plasticity , by using concepts like e.g.  the gudehus response envelope @xcite .",
    "other theoretical approaches involve ideas proposed by einav @xcite , or by jiang and liu @xcite , for which our results can provide a microscopically based calibration of parameters , but details are not discussed here .",
    "the information obtained for the pure elastic range can then be used to decouple the plastic contribution , associated with rearrangements , and to study the flow rule .",
    "the validation of the present analysis with experimental data is another important goal .",
    "nevertheless the issue of measuring fabric from laboratory experiments is far from solved , even though big advances have been made in recent years using photoelasticity , and microtomography ct - scans @xcite .",
    "a partial validation is anyway possible when measuring the residual dependence of the elastic response from variables other than stress and porosity @xcite , by means of acoustic measurements @xcite .",
    "the behavior after more than one cycle deserves further investigation , from both simulational and theoretical points of view , to detect features like creep , liquefaction and ratcheting , analyzed in preliminary works @xcite with constant elastic moduli and for many cycles @xcite . finally , a general tensor formulation that allows for highly different orientations of strain rate , stress and fabric is an open issue but can be inspired by the works of thornton @xcite and zhao & guo @xcite .",
