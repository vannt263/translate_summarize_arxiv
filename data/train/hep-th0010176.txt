    "in discussions of the heisenberg minimal uncertainty relation special attention has been focused on coherent states and squeezed states of the light field @xcite .",
    "the idea of squeezing has both fundamental and practical interests .",
    "a special physical proposal for obtaining squeezed state is based on the superposition of coherent states along a straight line on the plane of @xmath7 , the eigenvalues of the annihilation operators @xcite , which is easy to generalize to the @xmath0-deformed case .",
    "heisenberg s uncertainty relation is a direct result of the heisenberg commutation relation , which is the basis of quantum mechanics .    according to present tests of quantum electrodynamics , quantum theories based on heisenberg s commutation relation are correct at least down to @xmath8  cm .",
    "the question arises whether there is a possible generalization of heisenberg s commutation relation at shorter distances . in searching for such a possibility at short distances considerations of the space structure",
    "is a useful guide .",
    "if the space structure at such short distances exhibits a non - commutative property , and thus is governed by a quantum group symmetry , it has been shown that @xmath0-deformed quantum mechanics is a candidate for a possible pre - quantum theory at short distances . in the literature",
    "different frameworks of @xmath0-deformed quantum mechanics were established .    at the level of the uncertainty relation",
    "there are two kinds of modifications of heisenberg s uncertainty relation @xcite , implying under- or over - cutting of heisenberg s minimal uncertainty relation . because the framework of @xmath0-deformed heisenberg algebra developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which is associated with the under - cutting phenomenon @xcite shows clear physical contents : its relation to the corresponding @xmath0-deformed boson commutation relation and the limiting process of the @xmath0-deformed harmonic oscillator to the undeformed one are clear , in this paper our attention is focused on this framework .",
    "we investigate a special @xmath0-deformed squeezed state , which is a @xmath0-deformation of the squeezed state proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "first we need to clarify consistent representations of @xmath0-occupation number states and @xmath0-coherent states , which are consistent with the @xmath0-deformed heisenberg algebra .",
    "then we construct @xmath0-generalization of the squeezed states proposed in @xcite .    for such a @xmath0-deformed squeezed state",
    "there is a similar local maximum of squeezing as in the undeformed case , but the state shows an interesting new characteristic : as the amplitude of the related coherent state increases beyond the value corresponding to the local maximum of squeezing , the variance of one quadrature component of the light field shows a clear tendency of a second squeezing , whereas the corresponding variance for the undeformed case increases to the heisenberg minimal uncertainty .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0-deformed one exhibits a critical phenomenon : when the amplitude of the related coherent state increases to a critical point the variance of one component of the quadrature of the light field approaches zero ; meanwhile the variance of the corresponding conjugate operator remains finite .",
    "this is a surprising deviation from heisenberg s uncertainty relation .",
    "the qualitative character exposed by this @xmath0-squeezed state is a clear indication of deviation from the heisenberg uncertainty relation and may provide some evidence about @xmath0-deformed effects to present experiments .    in order to demonstrate the critical phenomenon of",

    "it is important to make distinctions for different realizations of the @xmath0-algebra by different ranges of @xmath0 values . following refs .",
    "@xcite we only consider the case @xmath16 in this paper .",
    "the operator @xmath12 is called the scaling operator , it closely relates to properties of the dynamics and plays an essential role in @xmath0-deformed quantum mechanics . the definition of the algebra ( [ eq : q - algebra ] )",
    "is based on the definition of the hermitian momentum operator @xmath10 . however",
    ", if @xmath9 is assumed to be a hermitian operator in a hilbert space the usual quantization rule @xmath17 does not yield a hermitian momentum operator . ref .",
    "@xcite showed that a hermitian momentum operator @xmath10 is related to @xmath18 and @xmath9 in a nonlinear way by introducing a scaling operator @xmath12 @xmath19 , \\qquad \\bar\\partial_x =- q^{-1/2}u\\partial_x , \\qquad p=-\\frac{i}{2}(\\partial_x-\\bar\\partial_x).\\ ] ]    such defined hermitian momentum @xmath10 leads to @xmath0-deformed effects , which are exhibited by the dynamical equation .",
    "for example , the perturbative expansion of the @xmath0-deformed schrdinger equation possesses a complex structure , which amounts to some additional momentum - dependent interaction , @xcite , .",
