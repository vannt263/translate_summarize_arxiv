    "topological phases of condensed matter have attracted increasing attention in recent years .",
    "examples include spin liquids , fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states , and topological insulators , which exhibit fractionalized excitations and statistics @xcite .",
    "a particularly novel application has been the proposal of utilizing non - abelian elementary excitations of topological phases to achieve fault - tolerant topological quantum computation @xcite . to this end , kitaev , in a seminal paper @xcite ,",
    "introduced a model of interacting spins on a honeycomb lattice which reduces to the problem of majorana fermions coupled to a static @xmath2 gauge field .",
    "the ground state is topologically nontrivial and breaks time reversal ( tr ) symmetry , and the elementary excitations are anyonic , with non - abelian statistics .",
    "much progress has been made toward understanding the nature of this phase @xcite , and in generalizing the model to other lattices @xcite and to three dimensions @xcite .",
    "very recently , a generalization to a decorated honeycomb lattice exhibiting a chiral spin liquid ground state was made by yao _",

    "the solvability of the kitaev model depends crucially on the property of the pauli - matrices , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which are the simplest example of a clifford algebra .",
    "this gives rise to the constraint that all the above models are defined in lattices with the coordination number three , and thus most of them are on lattices of dimension two .",
    "extending the kitaev model to more general lattices , three dimensions , and large spin systems enriches this class of solvable topological models .",
    "these extensions naturally involve higher ranked clifford algebras , with @xmath8-dimensional matrices , which can be interpreted as high spin multipole operators . some early work on exactly solvable models in the @xmath0-matrix representation of the clifford algebra has been done in refs .",
    "[ ] .    in this article , we generalize the kitaev model from the pauli matrices to the clifford algebra of @xmath0-matrices . for the @xmath9 representation ,",

    "it is interesting that although each spin - quadrapole operator is tr invariant , the ground state spontaneously breaks tr symmetry .",
    "such a state is a topologically nontrivial chiral spin liquid state with extremely short ranged spin correlation functions .",

    "is also discussed , wherein a topologically non - trivial spin - liquid state appears along which manifests a suitable defined `` time - reversal - like '' symmetry .",
    "before elucidating the details of our model , it will prove useful to reflect on why the kitaev model is equivalent to noninteracting fermions in a static @xmath2 gauge field .",

    "the combination of these triangles yields the square @xmath75 .",
    "one then has @xmath76 since the single link @xmath77 is held in common , but is traversed in opposite directions .",
    "a second point regarding the fluxes @xmath66 is that if @xmath78 is the number of links contained in @xmath56 , then traversing @xmath56 clockwise rather than counterclockwise results in a flux of @xmath79 .",
