    "global population explosion is viewed by many as a major threat to the well - being and stability of the human race .",
    "consequently , various population control policies were proposed , with the goal of curbing the growth of the human population on earth . some of those policies were even implemented in different countries , the chinese one - child policy being the most well - known instance .",
    "this paper is concerned with a less well - studied side - effect of such policies , namely , the potential risk to the fabric structure of society , in the form of _ societal fragmentation_. our main contribution is to demonstrate the potential occurrence of this effect , by viewing society as a _ social network _ and employing tools of social network theory .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate that different population control policies may yield radically different outcomes in terms of fragmentation , even if they yield essentially the same outcome in terms of the resulting population size .",
    "a social network represents society as a graph , in which vertices represent individual members of society and a link connecting two vertices represents a social connection between the two individuals . by `` societal fragmentation '' we refer to the situation where the social network becomes disconnected , and breaks into a large number of separate ( medium to large ) connected components .",
    "in contrast , the network is considered to be connected , or non - fragmented , if it consists of essentially one large connected component ( a so - called `` giant '' component ) , possibly along with some additional vanishingly small components .",
    "let us stress at the outset that a complete analysis of fragmentation as a function of population control policy in real networks requires a very precise and careful modeling , taking into account multiple parameters , and is outside the scope of the current paper .",
    "rather , our purpose is to illustrate the fragmentation effect and demonstrate its crucial dependence on the particular population control policies being utilized .",
    "we therefore adopt a simplistic societal model , stripping away many of the complicating parameters and focusing only on the pertinent features .",
    "societal connections are often classified into `` strong '' and `` weak '' ties , see @xcite .",
    "we employ a _ strong - ties _ network model of connectivity , namely , one that focuses only on strong ties , and ignores weak ties .",
    "hence , we consider the social network as fragmented into separate connected components if there are no strong ties connecting those components , even if there exist some weak ties that connect them .    in particular , our model assumes that family ties are strong ties , namely , there is a link connecting a person to his or her parents and siblings , as well as between spouses .",
    "in contrast , weaker types of social links ( e.g. , based on work / school relationships etc . ) are ignored .",
    "viewing the recent chinese history as a key example central to understanding the phenomena of population reduction and societal fragmentation , we seek to model social interconnections between the part of society that was directly affected by the population control policy , somewhat arbitrarily defined to be the generation born after 1980 , see @xcite .",
    "therefore , we view the social network as _ layered _ into generations , and focus on analyzing the connectivity properties within a single generation ( particularly , the latest ) . in view of this",
    ", we ignore parent - child links and include in our _ strong - ties _ network model only links between siblings and spouses .",
    "hence in our model , a _",
    "strong - ties social network _ is a social network where edges indicate sibling or marriage relations .",
    "the size and fabric structure of society are largely determined by two central parameters , collectively referred to hereafter as the _ family parameters _ , namely , the _ distribution of family sizes _ and the _ marriage ratio_.    the _ distribution of family sizes _ is described by a real vector @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the fraction of families with @xmath2 children , and @xmath3    the _ marriage ratio _ @xmath4 is defined as the parentage of married couples in the population .",
    "clearly , there could be a difference between men and women .",
    "since we are interested in population control , and assuming monogamy , we will measure the marriage ratio as the ratio between the total number of married women and the total number of women .    in order to be able to analyze strong - ties social networks , we distinguish between the two different types of links based on family ties , namely , _",
    "sibling _ links and _ marital _ links . in our graphical illustrations ,",
    "these two types of links are drawn in _",
    "blue _ and _ red _ , respectively .    as a first illustration of the effects of the family parameters on societal fragmentation ,",
    "let us consider two relevant examples , namely , the societal structure of the populations of current - day china and india .    based on the national statistics of china , see @xcite , the family size distribution @xmath5 in urban society in china ( with the vector truncated after the first six positions , i.e. , taking the last entry @xmath6 to represent the fraction of families with 5 or more children ) is @xmath7 the marriage ratio in china is @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : china ] depicts a social network denoted @xmath9 , generated by a simulation over a population of 157 individuals based on the above family parameters .",
    "node network @xmath9 , where the number of siblings simulates the distribution of siblings in large cities in china .",
    "blue edges connect siblings , while red edges connect married couples . as can be seen , the network consists of a few large families , represented by the blue cliques in the graph .",
    "there are six relatively large connected components , and 16 smaller connected components , 8 singletons and 8 connected components , with 3 or fewer edges . ]",
    "similarly , based on recent data on family size in india , see @xcite , the family size distribution vector @xmath10 in india ( again truncated after the first six positions , so that @xmath6 represents the fraction of families with 5 or more children ) is @xmath11 figure [ fig : india ] depicts a social network denoted @xmath12 , generated by a simulation over a population of 130 individuals based on this family size distribution and an estimated marriage ratio of @xmath13 .",
    "node network @xmath12 , where the number of siblings simulates the distribution of siblings in india .",
    "the blue edges connect siblings .",
    "the average number of siblings is @xmath14 , which is less than the real number in india , since the probability of having more than 7 siblings is assumed to be @xmath15 .",
    "the red edges connect married couples .",
    "as can be seen , the network contains a single giant component . ]    as can be clearly seen , these two simulations exhibit strikingly different behavior between the resulting strong - ties social networks in terms of connectivity . whereas the strong - ties social network @xmath9 is fragmented",
    ", the network @xmath12 remains connected and forms a giant component .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to try to explain and quantify the dependence of network fragmentation on the family parameters , in the hope of gaining a better understanding of the role and effects of population control policies .",
    "we begin ( in section [ sec : pcp ] ) by formally defining a class of population control policies and introducing a number of typical examples .",
    "we then study the implications of these policies on societal fragmentation , by simulating the implementation of these policies on a population of 200 individuals , and inspecting the resulting strong - ties social networks .",
    "our simulations indicate that the family size distribution resulting from the employed population control policy directly affects fragmentation .",
    "more interestingly , it turns out that different policies may exhibit very different fragmentation effects , even when their effects on the population size are very similar .",
    "we then turn to analyzing the probability that a given population control policy of the type described above will yield a fragmented society . in order to carry out this analysis we turn to studying infinite populations .",
    "this may appear odd , as clearly , population control deals with finite groups of people .",
    "however , mathematical analysis of percolation systems tends to be easier on infinite graphs .",
    "moreover , there is a standard way to transform the result from infinite graphs to finite graphs . basically , when dealing with infinite graphs the main question in percolation theory is the appearance of an infinite size connected component . in the context of a finite graph",
    ", this transforms into the existence of a linear sized `` giant '' connected component .",
    "therefore , we prove our results on an infinite size population .",
    "it follows from our results that strict policies , such as the 1-child policy employed in china until recently , effectively reduces population size , but are likely to result in a highly fragmented society , composed of many separate components . in fact , we prove that in order to avoid societal fragmentation , the population control policy must allow ( at least a small fraction of ) families of 3 or more children .",
    "in this section we introduce a simple class of population control policies , characterized as follows . a _ population control policy _",
    "is defined as a real vector @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the target fraction of families with @xmath2 children ( or the desired probability that a random family will have @xmath2 children ) .",
    "these values should satisfy @xmath18    the condition imposed by the population control policy @xmath19 is that at any given time , the family size distribution @xmath20 must satisfy the following condition : @xmath21 a possible method that can be applied in order to implement such a policy would be as follows . for every family @xmath22 , draw a target integer @xmath23 at random with the distribution @xmath19 , i.e. , setting @xmath24 with probability @xmath25 for every @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , the maximum number of children allowed for the family @xmath22 will be @xmath23 .    in order to demonstrate the sensitivity of the strong - ties social network to the population control policy used , we focus on a number of specific population control policies , to be described next .",
    "we begin by comparing two basic policies , named hereafter the _",
    "1-child policy _ and the _ @xmath26-children policy_. generally , these policies aim at reducing the population size by 50% in each generation , by attempting to impose an average of one child per family .    the 1-child policy ( @xmath27 ) : under this policy , each family is allowed at most one child .",
    "this policy can be described by the vector @xmath28 if imposed , such a policy ensures that at any given time , @xmath29 ( or necessarily @xmath30 ) , i.e. , there are no families with two or more children .    in the context of our discussion",
    ", this policy may be viewed as representing ( a simplified version of ) the original chinese population control policy .",
    "the main effect of the 1-child policy is that it strongly curbs the population size .",
    "for example , consider a generation consisting of a hundred men and a hundred women , where the marriage ratio is @xmath31 .",
    "the ( approximately ) 90 couples of this generation will have ( at most ) one child per family .",
    "this means that the population size was reduced to well below 50% of the size of the previous generation .    what interests us about this policy , however , is the fact that it completely eliminates sibling ties from the network of the new generation .",
    "hence the network breaks down into about 45 ( disconnected ) couples and a few unmarried individuals .",
    "figure [ fig:1c ] depicts the resulting strong - ties social network @xmath32 of the new generation under policy @xmath27 .",
    "obtained by simulating the 1-child policy @xmath27 starting with a generation of 200 individuals , with marriage ratio @xmath31 .",
    "the network has no sibling edges ( the only strong ties are marriage links ) , hence it is totally fragmented into pairs . ]",
    "the @xmath26-children policy ( @xmath33 ) : this policy also attempts to maintain the average family size at one child .",
    "it is described by the vector @xmath34 namely , @xmath35 and all other probabilities are zero . as discussed earlier , such a policy",
    "can be implemented by flipping an unbiased coin for each family and , depending on the outcome , allowing the family either zero or two children .",
    "observe that the outcome of applying the @xmath26-children policy is essentially almost identical to that of the 1-child policy in terms of controlling population size . on the other hand ,",
    "we claim that it does a better job maintaining sibling ties and thus keeping society connected .",
    "indeed , consider again the scenario of a generation consisting of a hundred men and a hundred women , with a marriage ratio of @xmath31 .",
    "figure [ fig:02c ] depicts the resulting strong - ties social network @xmath36 of the next generation when applying policy @xmath33 in this scenario .",
    "note that of the married couples of the first generation , about half will have ( at most ) two children per family , and the other half will have no children at all ( hence these families will not be represented in the network of the next generation ) .",
    "this means that the goal of reducing the population size by 50% is achieved by the 0/2-child policy just as effectively as by the 1-child policy .",
    "however , the 0/2-child policy produces a next generation that still has sibling links , although perhaps not enough to maintain complete connectivity , as implied by the simulated network appearing in figure [ fig:02c ] .",
    "obtained by simulating the 0/2-child policy @xmath33 starting with 200 individuals and @xmath31 . ]",
    "next , we similarly compare two population control policies that aim at maintaining the population size at steady state , i.e. , attempt to impose an average of two children per family .",
    "the 2-children policy ( @xmath37 ) : under this policy , each family is allowed at most two children .",
    "this policy can be described by the vector @xmath38 if imposed , such a policy ensures that at any given time , @xmath39 i.e. , there are no families with three or more children .    in the context of our discussion , this policy may represent ( a simplified version of ) the new chinese population control policy .",
    "again , this policy keeps population size more or less stable , but it also limits the number of sibling ties in the network . returning to the scenario examined with the previous two policies , of 200 individuals with marriage ratio @xmath31 , under the 2-children policy the married couples of the first generation will have two children per family , so the population size in the next generation will remain similar to ( or slightly smaller than ) that of the previous generation . note , hhowever , that sibling ties will occur in the resulting network of the new generation with the same frequency as in the @xmath33 policy .",
    "figure [ fig:2c ] depicts the strong - ties social network @xmath40 of the new generation resulting in the above scenario under policy @xmath37 .",
    "observe that this network is similar in structure to the network @xmath36 of figure [ fig:02c ] , but is about twice its size .",
    "obtained by simulating the 2-child policy @xmath37 starting with 200 individuals and @xmath31 . ]    the @xmath41-children policy ( @xmath42 ) : this policy also attempts to maintain the average family size at two children .",
    "it is described by the vector @xmath43 namely , @xmath44 and @xmath45 and all other probabilities are zero .",
    "such a policy can be implemented by flipping an biased @xmath46 coin for each family and , depending on the outcome , allowing the family either zero or three children .",
    "the outcome of applying this policy is essentially almost identical to that of the 2-child policy in terms of controlling population size , but again , its impact on societal fragmentation is rather different .",
    "this can be realized by inspecting figure [ fig:03c ] , which depicts the resulting strong - ties social network @xmath47 of the new generation when applying policy @xmath42 in the scenario discussed above .",
    "obtained by simulating the 0/3-child policy @xmath42 starting with 200 individuals and @xmath31 . ]",
    "it should be realized that of the approximately 90 married couples of the original generation , about 30 families have no children , hence these families are not represented in the network .",
    "the other 60 families , however , have 3 children each , which yields a next generation with a population of about 180 .",
    "most significantly , observe that in this network , the effect of the higher fraction of families with three children already suffices to ensure rather solid connectivity .",
    "in this section we analyze the likelihood that the strong - ties social network becomes fragmented , and show that this is dependent on the two family parameters discussed above , namely , the family size distribution @xmath20 and the marriage ratio @xmath4 , hence in turn it depends also on the population control policy @xmath19 that s being used .",
    "one of the interesting implications of our analysis is that under the studied model , any population control policy that disallows families of 3 or more children incurs the possible risk of societal fragmentation .",
    "specifically , for the @xmath41-children population control policy @xmath42 , our results imply that there is a critical value for the marriage ratio @xmath4 , such that the network becomes fragmented for @xmath4 values below this threshold , and is connected for higher @xmath4 values .",
    "as discussed earlier , we perform this analysis on an infinite size population , and hence our definition for societal fragmentation changes with respect to the simulation based observations presented in the previous section . we say that society is non - fragmented if an infinite size connected component emerges ( with positive probability ) .      the _ galton - watson branching process _",

    "this selection may be done randomly ( thus ensuring at least some minimal degree of fairness ) , or alternatively by applying a variety of social and economic criteria .    such a policy ( or one designed along similar principles ) may succeed in curbing population size , keeping in mind the fact that the marriage ratio is below 1 . specifically , assuming @xmath119 , the expected population reduction in one generation when using policy @xmath117 is 3.4% , even assuming each family utilizes its quota of allowed children in full .",
    "at the same time , the @xmath117 policy succeeds also in preventing societal fragmentation .",
    "note that the expected value of @xmath50 when using policy @xmath117 is @xmath120 so assuming specifically @xmath119 , we get @xmath121 hence by theorem [ thm : durrett](c ) , an infinite size connected component will emerge ( in an infinite population ) with nonzero probability .",
