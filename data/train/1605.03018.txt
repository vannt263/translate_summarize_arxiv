    "the non - additivity parameter @xmath16 can in general be either positive or negative .",
    "recent primitive model simulations@xcite of the mean force between charged colloids have identified surprisingly large non - zero values of non - additivity , although to - date experimental evidence for non - additivity in charged systems is absent .",
    "accordingly , an important open question is to what extent are the pair interactions between charged micro- and nano - particles in real systems non - additive ?",
    "the deryaguin - landau - verwey - overbeek ( dlvo ) theory , developed almost 70 years ago@xcite , has been used extensively to calculate the effective pair potential between charged colloids immersed in a solution of ions .",
    "the potential contains three elements : a hard core excluded volume interaction preventing overlap of the particles , attractive terms arising from dispersion forces , and an electrostatic screened yukawa pair potential which was derived by linearizing the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) equation in the debye - hckel ( dh ) limit .",
    "the repulsive part of the potential between two colloids @xmath4 and @xmath5 at a pair separation @xmath7 is assumed to be @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the surface charge and radius of species @xmath4 , and @xmath20 is the enhancement in the yukawa point charge@xcite as the ionic atmosphere is excluded from the hard core of each particle so @xmath21 . for clarity , we label the large particle as species 1 , so the size ratio @xmath22 . inspection of eqs .",
    "[ equyukawa][eqdlvobinary ] reveals that the non - additivity parameter @xmath16 is zero in the dlvo theory , since the surface charge is a constant independent of its neighbours .",
    "indeed inspired by dlvo , it is generally accepted wisdom that non - additivity effects in charged systems are either zero@xcite or else too small to be significant@xcite .",
    "so additive pair potentials , for instance , have been widely employed to rationalize the rich electrostatic self assembly seen in experiments on binary charged nanoparticle and colloidal systems@xcite .    for _ symmetric _ ( equal - sized ) mixtures , the dlvo expression for the repulsive pair potential has , in the main , been amply verified both by direct force measurements@xcite ( using techniques such as optical tweezers , video microscopy , or colloidal probe atomic force microscopy ) as well as first - principles primitive model computer simulations@xcite .",

    "furthermore , the only comprehensive study@xcite has focussed on the highly - screened limit ( @xmath23 ) , where the thickness of the ionic double layer ( @xmath24 ) is thin by comparison with the particle radius @xmath25 and the effect of curvature is expected to be small .    in this work",

    "blinking optical tweezers ( bot ) and digital video microscopy we probe directly _ in - situ _ the forces acting on spherical poly(ionic - liquid ) colloids immersed in a nonpolar electrolyte solution .",
    "our strategy is to use optical tweezers to select four individual colloidal microspheres - two particles of species 1 and two of species 2 - suspended in the same fluid environment .",
    "we then measure the symmetric interactions @xmath27 between a pair of particles of type ( 11 ) , by temporarily relocating the particles of type 2 far away in a distant pair of traps .",
    "the positions of the particle pairs are then swapped over and the measurements repeated to determine @xmath28 .",
    "finally , by exchanging one particle from the ( 11 ) pair with one from the ( 22 ) pair we determine the asymmetric two - body interactions @xmath29 and so evaluate the non - additivity parameter @xmath16 in - situ in a fixed environment .",

    "the dependence of the measured non - additivity on the screening length is seen to follow reasonably well the same trend as the dh expression which suggests that the origin of the non - additivity is indeed the doubly - screened ion exclusion terms .",

    "consequently , we suspect that the positive non - additivity predicted for equal - sized mixtures with different charge levels may be strong enough to drive a fluid - fluid phase separation .",
    "interestingly , such a phase separation has been reported in charge asymmetric mixtures@xcite , precisely under conditions where we predict a small positive non - additivity .",
    "in addition , non - additivity effects are expected to have a particularly pronounced effect on the stability of mixed crystalline phases@xcite .",
    "indeed it is possible that assuming @xmath199 might account for the puzzling observation of non - close - packed phase formation in binary nanocrystal mixtures@xcite , which is inconsistent@xcite with calculations where the non - additivity parameter has been set to zero .",
