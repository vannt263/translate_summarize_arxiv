    "understanding the baryon spectrum and the search for the missing baryon resonances are hot topics in hadron physics . for the scarcity of high quality antikaon beams and the small production rate for the @xmath0 resonances via an electromagnetic probe , the @xmath0 spectrum is still far from being established .",
    "there are only a few data on the @xmath0 resonances from the old bubble chamber experiments with small statistics . among the eleven @xmath0 baryons listed in the review of the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite , only the ground octet and decuplet , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , are well established with four - star ratings .",
    "although the resonances @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath8 and @xmath20 are three - star states in pdg , only @xmath3 has a determined spin - parity @xmath6 .",
    "a few theoretical studies of the @xmath0 baryon spectrum can be found in the literature  @xcite .",
    "all of the phenomenological models can well explain the two ground states @xmath26 and @xmath27 , however , their predictions for the excitations are very different . for example , there is a lot of controversy about the spin - parity of @xmath2 .",
    "it might be the first radial excitation of @xmath0 with @xmath15 according to the mass calculations with a nonrelativistic quark model by chao _",
    "et al . _",
    "this classification was also supported by the recent quark model study of melde _ et al . _",
    "however , with a relativized quark model capstick and isgur predicted that the first radial excitation of @xmath0 should have a larger mass of @xmath28 mev  @xcite .",
    "recently , pervin and roberts suggested that @xmath2 could be assigned to the first orbital excitation of @xmath0 with @xmath4 , although their quark model predicted mass is about 35 mev heavier than the mass of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "they believed that a more microscopic treatment of spin - orbit interactions , can be expected to drive this state to slightly lower mass .",
    "the calculations from the skyrme model also indicated that @xmath2 should have @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath2 was discussed to be a dynamically generated state with @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that _ babar _ collaboration , in a study of @xmath29 , recently found some evidence that @xmath2 has @xmath4  @xcite .    even for the @xmath3 with",
    "well determined spin - parity quantum numbers , @xmath6 , there still exist many puzzles in the explanations of its nature . considering @xmath3 as a @xmath6 orbital excitation , its mass and decay properties could be well explained in the nonrelativistic quark model  @xcite and algebraic model  @xcite . however , considering @xmath3 as a @xmath6 excitation , the mass of @xmath3 is obviously underestimated by the relativized quark model  @xcite and one - boson exchange model  @xcite . in the unitary chiral approaches , @xmath3",
    "was even suggested to be a dynamically generated state from the @xmath30 decuplet - pion octet chiral interaction  @xcite .",
    "although @xmath8 is a three - star state listed in pdg , not much can be said about its properties  @xcite .",
    "according to various phenomenological model predictions  @xcite , many states with spin - parity quantum numbers , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , could be candidates for @xmath8 , because their predicted masses are close to 1950 mev .",
    "_ suggested that the broad @xmath0 resonance ( @xmath34 mev ) with a mass of @xmath35 mev observed by them could be classified as the pure @xmath11 octet state  @xcite . with this assignment",
    ", the mass and total and partial decay widths seemed to be reasonably understood .",
    "however , the observations of biagi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite do not satisfy this classification .",
    "although they observed a @xmath0 resonance around 1950 mev in the @xmath19 invariant mass distribution , its favorable spin - parity should be @xmath36 or its spin should be greater than @xmath37 in the natural spin - parity series @xmath38 , @xmath39 , etc  @xcite .",
    "in fact , there might be more than one @xmath0 near 1950 mev  @xcite .",
    "recently , valderrama , xie and nieves proposed the existence of three @xmath8 states : one of these states would be part of a spin - parity @xmath40 decuplet and the other two probably would belong to the @xmath36 and @xmath41 octets  @xcite .    about @xmath20 , not many discussions can be found in the literature .",
    "a moment analysis of  @xcite suggested that the spin of @xmath20 should be @xmath42 . according to the su(3 ) symmetry of hadrons , samios _ et al .",
    "_ predicted that @xmath20 was most likely to be the partner of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 with @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "the quark model mass calculations indicated that the second @xmath22 state and @xmath21 state might be candidates for @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "however , the recent strong decay analysis of  @xcite did not support the classification of  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the situation of the poor knowledge about these hyperon resonances is to be changed completely with the running of the japan proton accelerator research complex ( j - parc ) facility , where high quality antikaon beams will be available very soon  @xcite .",
    "then , the @xmath0 baryons can be directly produced on the nucleons by the process @xmath46 with large production cross sections .",
    "furthermore , the investigation of @xmath0 baryons is also one of the major parts of the physics programs at @xmath47 via the process @xmath48",
    "@xcite , at jlab via the photo - production processes , @xmath49 and @xmath50  @xcite , and at besiii via the process @xmath51",
    "@xcite , etc .",
    "thus , these new facilities provide us with good chances to study the @xmath0 spectrum .    stimulated by the great progress achieved in experiments , more and more theoretical interests have begun to focus on the @xmath0 physics . for example , some theoretical studies of the production of @xmath0 via @xmath46  @xcite and @xmath49  @xcite , and the determination of the parity of @xmath0 resonances in these reactions were started recently  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we make a systematic study of the strong decays of the @xmath0 resonances in a chiral quark model , which has been developed and successfully used to deal with the strong decays of charmed baryons and heavy - light mesons  @xcite . here",
    ", we mainly focus on the three - star @xmath0 resonances @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath8 and @xmath20 .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in the subsequent section ,",
    "baryons in the constituent quark model are outlined .",
    "then a brief review of the strong decays described within a chiral quark model approach is given in sec .",
    "the numerical results are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "finally , a summary is given in sec .",
    "a baryon containing three quarks may be described by an oscillator potential hamiltonian @xcite in a nonrelativistic form : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the coordinate and momentum for the @xmath55th quark in the baryon rest frame , respectively .",
