    "divisibility is an essential property between elements of algebraic structures . as we know , the concept of congruence originates from that of divisibility and it is not only a convenient notation but also a very helpful method to prove many theorems in number theory . for this reason , almost every textbook for number theory treats this topic extensively ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "there are very close relationships between the congruences and the exponential sums . in general",
    ", we may frequently use the properties of congruences to estimate any exponential sum ( see @xcite ) .",
    "discrepancy is also an important concept ( or quantity ) of number theory .",
    "it measures the deviation of the sequence from an ideal distribution and can be applied to problems in numerical analysis .",
    "we can easily calculate , e.g. , by the inequality of erds  turn , the upper bound of the discrepancy if the related exponential sum has been estimated .",
    "so , the estimations of the exponential sums are very interesting .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath5 be relatively prime integers .",
    "the ( multiplicative ) _ order _ of @xmath1 modulo @xmath6 is defined as the least positive exponent @xmath7 such that @xmath8 , and we will denote it by @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath10 in this paper , we investigate the solutions of a congruence related to the order of an odd integer modulo @xmath4 .",
    "these results will be applied to the study of an estimation of exponential sums .",
    "for a positive integer @xmath2 and an odd integer @xmath1 , we recall that the order of @xmath1 modulo @xmath4 is defined by @xmath12    given an @xmath13 , assume that @xmath1 is an odd integer such that @xmath14 .",
    "then @xmath15    by the definition , we have @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17 for some @xmath18 .",
    "thus , for @xmath19 , we obtain @xmath20 since @xmath21 is odd and @xmath22 .",
    "( if @xmath23 , then there is an integer @xmath24 with @xmath25 and hence @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath27 , a contradiction . )",
    "however , it holds that @xmath28 therefore , it holds that @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath30 is an integer and @xmath1 is an odd integer with @xmath31 , then the previous lemma implies that @xmath32 . if @xmath33 then @xmath34 .",
    "thus , for @xmath30 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 is a positive integer .",
    "the following lemma reveals that the congruence @xmath37 has at most three distinct solutions ( modulo @xmath4 ) .",
    "however , as we see in lemmas 3 and 4 below , the congruence can have only two distinct solutions , @xmath38 and @xmath39 modulo @xmath4 , indeed .",
    "assume that @xmath2 is an integer @xmath40 and @xmath1 is an odd integer with @xmath41 .",
    "every solution of the following congruence @xmath42 is congruent to one of @xmath43 modulo @xmath4 .",
    "since @xmath1 is odd , so is @xmath44 . set @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath7 are some integers with @xmath47 .",
    "it then follows from the definition of @xmath48 that @xmath49 therefore , we get @xmath50 , i.e. , @xmath51 .    1 .",
    "suppose @xmath7 is odd .",
    "then , @xmath52 is even .",
    "hence , it follows that @xmath53 . as @xmath54",
    ", we conclude that @xmath55 .",
    "due to ( [ eq : sm1 ] ) , we have @xmath56 if we square both sides of the last equality , then @xmath57 as @xmath58 , it follows from the last equality that @xmath59 , i.e. , @xmath60 . by ( [ eq : sm1 ] ) and the last congruence , we have @xmath61 , i.e. , there exists an integer @xmath24 such that @xmath62 .",
    "if @xmath63 is even , it then follows from ( [ eq : sm1 ] ) that @xmath64 . if @xmath63 is odd , we get @xmath65 .",

    "2 .   if @xmath33 , then @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , the given congruence reduces to @xmath95 . altogether",
    ", it follows that @xmath96 , which is a contradiction .    in the following theorem",
    ", we will summarize all the results of lemmas  2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "let @xmath2 be a given integer larger than @xmath97 and let @xmath1 be a given odd integer .    1 .",

    "for any non - zero integer @xmath100 , we denote by @xmath101 the _ greatest exponent _ @xmath7 of @xmath97 satisfying @xmath102 , i.e. , @xmath103 , and we use the notation @xmath104 for thiscase .    every non - zero integer @xmath100 can be represented by @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is an odd integer .    for an odd integer @xmath107",
