    "subordination is a powerful tool in the study of random processes . in the present work ,",
    "we investigate subordination of random trees , and we apply our results to properties of the random metric space called the brownian map , which has been proved to be the universal scaling limit of many different classes of random planar maps ( see in particular @xcite ) .",
    "these applications have been motivated by the work of miller and sheffield @xcite , which is part of a program aiming at the construction of a conformal structure on the brownian map ( see @xcite for recent developments in this direction ) .    to explain our starting point ,",
    "let us consider a compact @xmath0-tree @xmath2 .",
    "this means that @xmath2 is a compact metric space such that , for every @xmath3 , there exists a unique ( continuous injective ) path from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , up to reparameterization , and the range of this path , which is called the geodesic segment between @xmath4 and @xmath5 and denoted by @xmath6 , is isometric to a compact interval of the real line .",
    "we assume that @xmath2 is rooted , so that there is a distinguished point @xmath7 in @xmath2 .",
    "this allows us to define a generalogical order on @xmath2 , by saying that @xmath8 if and only if @xmath9 .",
    "consider then a continuous function @xmath10 , such that @xmath11 and @xmath12 is nondecreasing for the genealogical order .",
    "the basic idea of subordination is to identify @xmath4 and @xmath5 if @xmath12 is constant on the geodesic segment @xmath6 .",
    "so , for every @xmath13 , the set of all points that are identified with @xmath4 is a closed connected subset of @xmath2 .",
    "this glueing operation yields another compact @xmath0-tree @xmath14 , which is equipped with a metric such that the distance between @xmath7 and @xmath4 is @xmath15 and is called the subordinate tree of @xmath2 with respect to @xmath12 ( see fig.[subordina - tree ] for an illustration ) .",
    "furthermore , if our initial tree @xmath2 was given as the tree coded by a continuous function @xmath16\\la\\r_+$ ] ( see @xcite or section [ sec : determin ] below ) , the subordinate tree @xmath14 is coded by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the canonical projection from @xmath19 $ ] onto @xmath2 .     on the left side , the tree @xmath2 , with segments where @xmath12 is constant pictured in thin blue lines . on the right side ,",
    "the subordinate tree , where each connected component of @xmath2 made of thin segments has been glued into a single point.,width=529 ]    our main interest is in the case where @xmath2 is random , and more precisely @xmath20 is the `` brownian tree '' coded by a positive brownian excursion @xmath21 under the it excursion measure .",
    "one may view @xmath22 as a variant of aldous brownian crt , for which the total mass is not finite , but is distributed according to an infinite measure on @xmath23 . as previously , we write @xmath24 for the canonical projection from @xmath19 $ ] onto @xmath22 .",
    "next , to define the subordination function , we let @xmath25 be ( linear ) brownian motion indexed by @xmath22 , starting from @xmath26 at the root @xmath7 .",
    "a simple way to construct this process is to use the brownian snake approach , letting @xmath27 if @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the `` tip '' of the random path @xmath30 , which is the value at time @xmath31 of the brownian snake driven by @xmath32 .",
    "since @xmath32 is distributed according to the it measure , @xmath33 follows the brownian snake excursion measure away from @xmath26 , which we denote by @xmath34 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter iv ) ) .",
    "we then set @xmath35 . in terms of the brownian snake , we have @xmath36 whenever @xmath28 .",
    "we also use the notation @xmath37 .",
    "[ subor - brown ] let @xmath38 stand for the subordinate tree of @xmath22 with respect to the ( continuous nondecreasing ) function @xmath39 . under the brownian snake excursion measure @xmath34 , the tree @xmath40 is a lvy tree with branching mechanism @xmath41    recall that lvy trees represent the genealogy of continuous - state branching processes @xcite , and can be characterized by a regenerative property analogous to the branching property of galton  watson trees @xcite .",
    "our identification of the distribution of @xmath38 is reminiscent of the classical result stating that the right - continuous inverse of the maximum process of a standard linear brownian motion is a stable subordinator with index @xmath42 .    in view of our applications , it turns out that it is important to have more information than the mere identification of @xmath38 as a random compact @xmath0-tree .",
    "as mentioned above , @xmath38 can be viewed as the tree coded by the random function @xmath43 .",
    "this coding induces a `` lexicographical '' order structure on @xmath22 ( see @xcite for a thorough discussion of order structures on @xmath0-trees ) .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , it is not immediately clear that the order structure on @xmath38 induced by the coding from the function @xmath44 coincides with the usual order structure on lvy trees , corresponding to the uniform random shuffling at every node in the terminology of @xcite . to obtain this property ,",
    "we relate the function @xmath44 to the height process of @xcite .",
    "we recall that , from a lvy process with laplace exponent @xmath45 , we can construct a continuous random process @xmath46 called the height process , which codes the @xmath45-lvy tree ( here and below we say @xmath45-lvy tree rather than lvy tree with branching mechanism @xmath45 for simplicity ) .",
    "see section [ sec : levy - tree ] below for more details .",
    "[ subordi - coding ] there exists a process @xmath47 , which is distributed under @xmath34 as the height process of a lvy tree with branching mechanism @xmath48 , and a continuous random process @xmath49 with nondecreasing sample paths , such that we have , @xmath34 a.e . for every @xmath50 ,",
    "@xmath51    both @xmath47 and @xmath49 will be constructed in the proof of theorem [ subordi - coding ] , and are measurable functions of @xmath52 .",
    "it is possible to identify the random process @xmath49 as a continuous additive functional of the brownian snake , but we do not need this fact in the subsequent applications , and we do not discuss this matter in the present work .",
    "theorem [ subordi - coding ] implies that the tree coded by @xmath53 is isometric to the tree coded by @xmath54 , and we recover theorem [ subor - brown ] .",
    "but theorem [ subordi - coding ] gives much more , namely that the order structure induced by the coding via @xmath55 is the same as the order structure induced by the usual height function of the lvy tree .",
    "order structures are crucial for our applications to the brownian map .",
    "similarly as in @xcite , we deal with a version of the brownian map with randomized volume , which is constructed as a quotient space of the tree @xmath22 : two points @xmath4 and @xmath5 of @xmath22 are identified if @xmath56 and if @xmath57 for every @xmath58 $ ] , where @xmath59 $ ] is the set of all points that are visited when going from @xmath4 to @xmath5 around the tree in `` clockwise '' order ( for this to make sense , it is essential that @xmath22 has been equipped with a lexicographical order structure ) .",
    "we write @xmath60 for the resulting quotient space ( the brownian map ) and @xmath61 for the metric on the brownian map ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the space @xmath60 comes with two distinguished points , namely the root @xmath7 of @xmath22 and the unique point @xmath62 where @xmath63 attains its minimal value  in a sense that can be made precise , these two points are independent and uniformly distributed over @xmath60 .",
    "let @xmath64 be the closed ball of radius @xmath65 centered at @xmath62 in @xmath60 .",
    "for every @xmath66 , define the _ hull _ @xmath67 as the complement of the connected component of the complement of @xmath64 that contains @xmath7 ( informally , @xmath67 is obtained by filling in all holes of @xmath64 except for the one containing @xmath7 ) .",
    "following @xcite , we define the metric net @xmath68 as the closure of @xmath69 ( this definition is in fact a little different from @xcite which does not take the closure of the union in the last display . ) we can equip the set @xmath70 with an `` intrinsic '' metric @xmath71 derived from the brownian map metric @xmath61 .",
    "it is not hard to verify that , in the construction of @xmath60 as a quotient space of @xmath22 , points of @xmath68 exactly correspond to vertices @xmath4 of @xmath22 such that @xmath72 ( proposition [ descri - net ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the metric net @xmath68 is closely related to the subordinate tree of @xmath22 with respect to the function @xmath73 , which is a @xmath45-lvy tree by the preceding results . to make this relation precise ,",
    "we need the notion of the looptree introduced by curien and kortchemski @xcite in a more general setting . informally , the looptree associated with a lvy tree is constructed by replacing each point @xmath4 of infinite multiplicity by a loop of `` length '' equal to the `` weight '' of @xmath4 , in such a way that the subtrees that are the connected components of the complement of @xmath4 branch along this loop in an order determined by the coding function ( see fig.[looptree ] below for an illustration ) . to give a more precise definition , first note that theorem [ subordi - coding ] and an obvious symmetry argument allow us to find a process @xmath74 distributed as the height process of a @xmath45-lvy tree , and a continuous random process @xmath75 with nondecreasing sample paths such that @xmath76 .",
    "then let @xmath77 , and let @xmath78 be the equivalence relation on @xmath79 $ ] whose graph is the smallest closed symmetric subset of @xmath79 ^ 2 $ ] that contains all pairs @xmath80 with @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 for every @xmath84 .",
    "the looptree @xmath85 is defined as the quotient space @xmath79/\\sim$ ] equipped with an appropriate metric ( see @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , @xmath86 makes sense for any @xmath87 and is interpreted as the height of @xmath88 .",
    "the metric on @xmath85 is in fact not relevant for us , since we consider instead the pseudo - metric @xmath89 defined for @xmath90 by @xmath91 } h'_\\gamma ,   \\max_{\\gamma\\in[\\beta,\\alpha ] } h'_\\gamma\\bigg ) - h'_\\alpha -h'_\\beta,\\ ] ] where @xmath92 $ ] corresponds to the subset of @xmath85 visited when going from @xmath88 to @xmath93 `` around '' @xmath85 in `` clockwise order '' ( see section [ sec : br - map ] for a more formal definition ) .",
    "we write @xmath94 if @xmath95 ( informally this means that @xmath88 and @xmath93 `` face each other '' in the tree , in the sense that they are at the same height , and that points `` between '' @xmath88 and @xmath93 are at a smaller height ) .",
    "it turns out that this defines an equivalence relation on @xmath85 . finally , we let @xmath96 be the largest symmetric function on @xmath97 that is bounded above by @xmath89 and satisfies the triangle inequality .",
    "[ identi - net ] the metric net @xmath98 is a.s .",
    "isometric to the quotient space @xmath99 equipped with the metric induced by @xmath96 .",
    "see theorem [ identi - metricnet ] in section [ sec : br - map ] for a more precise formulation .",
    "theorem [ identi - net ] is closely related to proposition 4.4 in @xcite , where , however , the metric net is not identified as a metric space .",
    "the description of the metric net is an important ingredient of the axiomatic characterization of the brownian map discussed in @xcite .",
    "let us briefly comment on the motivations for studying the metric net .",
    "roughly speaking , the brownian map @xmath60 can be recovered from the metric net @xmath68 by filling in the `` holes '' . to make this precise , we observe that the connected components of @xmath100 are bounded by jordan curves ( proposition [ connec - compo ] ) and that these components are in one - to - one correspondence with connected components of @xmath101 , where @xmath102 .",
    "each of the latter components is associated with an excursion of the brownian snake above its minimum , in the terminology of @xcite , and the distribution of such an excursion only depends on its boundary size as defined in @xcite ( this boundary size can be interpreted as a generalized length of the jordan curve bounding the corresponding component of @xmath100 ) .",
    "theorem 40 in @xcite shows that , conditionally on their boundary sizes , these excursions are independent and distributed according to a certain `` excursion measure '' . in the brownian map setting , this means that the holes in the metric net are filled in independently , conditionally on the lengths of their boundaries .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 gives a brief discussion of subordination for deterministic trees , and section 3 recalls the basic facts about lvy trees that we need .",
    "after a short presentation of the brownian snake , section 4 gives the distribution of the subordinate tree @xmath38 ( theorem [ subor - brown ] ) . in view of identifying the order structure of this subordinate tree , section 5 provides a technical result showing that the height process coding a lvy tree is the limit in a strong sense of the discrete height functions coding embedded galton  watson trees .",
    "this result is related to the general limit theorems of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 2 ) proving that lvy trees are weak limits of galton  watson trees , but the fact that we get a strong approximation is crucial for our applications . in section 6 , we prove that the brownian snake maximum process @xmath103 is a time change of the height process associated with a @xmath45-lvy tree ( theorem [ subordi - coding ] ) .",
    "this result is a key ingredient of the developments of section 7 , where we identify the metric net of the brownian map ( theorem [ identi - net ] ) .",
    "section 8 discusses the connected components of the complement of the metric net , showing in particular that they are in one - to - one correspondence with the points of infinite multiplicity of the associated lvy tree , and that the boundary of each component is a jordan curve .",
    "section 9 , which is mostly independent of the preceding sections , discusses more general subordinations of the brownian tree @xmath22 , which lead to stable lvy trees with an arbirary index .",
    "this section is related to our previous article @xcite , which dealt with subordination for spatial branching processes , but the latter work did not consider the associated genealogical structures as we do here , and the subordination method , based on the so - called residual lifetime process , was also different .",
    "finally , the appendix presents a more general and more precise version of the special markov property of the brownian snake ( first established in @xcite ) , which plays an important role in several proofs .",
    "in this short section , we present a few elementary considerations about deterministic @xmath0-trees .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the basic facts about @xmath0-trees that we will need , and to @xcite for a thorough study of the coding of compact @xmath0-trees by functions .",
