    "in 1917 , einstein put forward an important exact spacetime which is recognized as the first relativistic cosmological model , i.e. , the es universe ; a static friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model with positive spatial curvature sourced by a perfect fluid and a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "it was static because it seemed natural to assume that the real universe is static at that time , i.e. , qualitatively unchanging in its large scale structure .",
    "however , though this initially appeared to be a reasonable model of a static universe , it was latter shown that es universe was unstable under small homogeneous and isotropic perturbations around equilibrium state @xcite . since then , es model has been widely realized to be unstable with respect to gravitational collapse or expansion .",
    "it has been also shown that es universe is always neutrally stable under small inhomogeneous vector and tensor perturbations and also against adiabatic scalar density inhomogeneities as long as the sound speed satisfies @xmath2 , and unstable otherwise @xcite .",
    "moreover , stability of es universe against the bianchi type - ix spatially homogeneous perturbations has been studied for various types of matter fields @xcite and it is found that the es universe is unstable against such perturbations .",
    "one of the most fundamental and ancient questions in standard cosmology is whether the universe has begun from a definite origin or whether it is past - eternal . in the past decades",
    ", this question has led to serious discussions based upon the knowledge of general theory of relativity ( gr ) and modern cosmology .",
    "recent accumulation of high resolution cosmological observations is compatible with the so called standard model of cosmology which includes number of interesting features .",
    "in addition to predicting that the universe is passing through an accelerated phase of expansion @xcite , this model also admits an initial singularity that most of the physicists refer to it as the big - bang singularity .",
    "indeed , under general physical circumstances on the matter content of the universe , gr equations imply that the present expanding phase must be preceded by a singular state of the universe where the physical quantities such as energy density and spacetime curvature diverge and the classical framework of gr breaks down @xcite . in order to remedy this shortcoming ,",
    "a huge amount of work and effort have been recently devoted to construct cosmological models which are non - singular and/or past - eternal .",
    "work along the former model has revealed that non - singular bouncing cosmologies could appear in various scenarios with matter fields violating positive energy conditions like in the quintom bounce @xcite , the ghost condensate bounce @xcite and the galileon bounce @xcite models or in the modified gravity theories such as string inspired gravity @xcite , horava gravity @xcite , non - relativistic gravity @xcite , gravity in the presence of torsion @xcite , nonlocal gravity @xcite , brane world scenarios @xcite and loop quantum cosmology @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent review ) . based on the latter model ,",
    "the search for singularity free cosmological models within the framework of gr has led to development of the so - called eu scenario @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the universe is initially in a past - eternal es state with spatially positive curvature and then eventually evolves to a subsequent inflationary phase .",
    "this cosmological model has several remarkable features : there is no initial singularity or beginning of time ; the universe is ever existing and it tends to a static universe in the past infinity rather than originating from a big bang singularity .",
    "the universe is isotropic and homogeneous at large scales and may contain exotic matter @xcite .",
    "there is also no horizon problem , nor is there a quantum gravity regime ( as the model claims ) since the scale of curvature always considerably exceeds the planck scale , so that the space - time may be treated as a classical entity .",
    "though the main component for constructing emergent scenarios is the es solution , the original model does not appear to be successful in solving the singularity problem since there is no stable es solution in classical gr .",
    "in other words , owing to the existence of perturbations , such as quantum fluctuations @xcite , it is too difficult for the universe to settle down for a long time in such an initial static state @xcite .",
    "however , it is a general belief that in its earliest stages , the universe is presumably under extreme physical conditions so that new effects , such as those coming from quantization of gravity , modifications of gr theory or even other new physics , may become significant . as a matter of fact , dealing with cosmological equations of modified gravity theories may leave us with many new static solutions , whose stability properties would crucially depend on the details of the theory .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the outcomes are substantially different from those of the classical es solution within the gr framework .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to extend the study of es universe beyond the einstein gravity . in this",
    "regard , stability of the es universe has been examined in various cosmological settings among which we quote : static cosmological models constructed in brane world models @xcite , modified gravity theories @xcite , scalar - fluid theories @xcite and loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "work along this line has been carried out by considering different types of matter such as , the effects of vacuum energy @xcite , non - constant pressure @xcite and a non - interacting mixture of isotropic radiation and a ghost scalar field @xcite .",
    "the first study of es universe and its stability in @xmath1 theory of gravity can be found in @xcite . in the latter work",
    ", it is shown that in contrast to classical gr , the modified es universe can be stabilized against homogeneous perturbations in the context of two well - known forms of @xmath1 with a positive cosmological constant and matter content described by a barotropic perfect fluid with equation of state ( eos ) @xmath3 .",
    "however , subsequent work on the es universe within the context of generic @xmath1 models has shown that einstein static solutions are always unstable against homogeneous or inhomogeneous perturbations @xcite .",
    "recently , a kind of modified theory of gravity has been developed as @xmath0 gravity which was first introduced in @xcite .",
    "this new proposal for modifying the gravity has been widely studied within various contexts such as thermodynamics  @xcite , energy conditions  @xcite , cosmological solutions from dynamical system point of view  @xcite , anisotropic cosmology  @xcite , wormhole solution  @xcite , scalar perturbations  @xcite , cosmology of non - interacting chaplygin gas  @xcite and some other studies such as , @xmath0 gravity in higher dimensions  @xcite , the effects of matter - curvature coupling on the distribution of matter configuration for a self - gravitating spherical body  @xcite and dark matter effects in spiral galaxies  @xcite .",
    "this theory extends @xmath1 gravity by including the trace of energy - momentum tensor ( emt ) , in addition to the ricci curvature scalar .",
    "the motivation of including the trace of emt may come from the effects of some exotic fluid , consequences of some unknown gravitational interactions or even quantum effects ( conformal anomaly )  @xcite .",
    "motivated by the above discussion , in the present work we investigate the existence of static solutions and their stability in the framework of @xmath0 theory of gravity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ field eqs ] we present the field equations of @xmath0 gravity and some related definitions and also give a few discussions on the conservation of emt . in sec  [ es sol ] , the es solution and its stability is investigated under two class of models : class i , which belongs to the @xmath0 models that respect to the conservation of emt and will be studied in subsection  [ sub1 ] .",
    "the second class introduces the models in which the conservation of emt is relaxed and will be presented in subsections  [ sub2 ] for a pressure - less matter and  [ sub3 ] for a barotropic perfect fluid . for the latter case ,",
    "we find that depending on the eos parameter and other model parameters , an eu scenario could arise from the es universe . in section  [ pert ] , we investigate the stability of es universe against homogeneous scalar perturbations and show that the results are consistent with those we shall find in subsections  [ sub1 ] and [ sub2 ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ con ] , we summarize our results .",
    "for later applications , we investigate two situations .",
    "we first consider the case(s ) in which the conservation of emt is respected and then proceed with studying those cases for which the conservation of emt does not hold . in the first one ,",
    "the following constraint for multi perfect fluids can be calculated by applying the bianchi identity to the field equation ( [ frt field equations ] ) as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of perfect fluids .",
    "the satisfaction of this constraint guaranties the conservation of emt .",
    "the above constraint equation for a pressure - less matter gives @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the hubble parameter .",
    "substituting expression ( [ choice ] ) into the constraint ( [ constraint2 ] ) and after a straightforward algebra , we get a specific form for @xmath36 as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are constants of integration .    from another side ,",
    "if we set the conservation of emt to be relaxed , the bianchi identity would lead to the following covariant equation between the function @xmath40 , the emt and its trace as @xmath41 where we have dropped the argument of @xmath40 .",
    "notice that in the last fourth terms of equation ( [ relation ] ) , only @xmath23 would appear since the function @xmath42 and its derivative are non - zero only for the cold dark matter .",
    "however , in the first term we still have the term @xmath43 for the radiation part . therefore , equation ( [ relation ] ) can be considered as the sum of two terms ; those that are related to the radiation and other terms which are related to the cold dark matter ( for @xmath44 ) , which totally must be set to zero .",
    "nevertheless , a simple choice is @xmath45 which means that , the radiation and the cold dark matter would evolve independently such that the radiation does follow the conservation of emt .",
    "it can then be easily seen that the radiation density would depend on the scale factor as @xmath46 .",
    "however , the evolution of the cold dark matter density would follow the solution of equation ( [ relation-1 ] ) rather than the usual case in the standard cosmology i.e. , @xmath47 . for the line element ( [ metricfrw ] ) ,",
    "equation ( [ relation-1 ] ) takes the following form @xmath48 thus , having determined the functionality of @xmath36 in the non - conserved case , it is the above equation that governs the behavior of the cold dark matter density in terms of the scale factor .",
    "for example ,",
    "if we set @xmath49 we obtain @xmath50",
    "our attempt here is to bring forward three classes of solutions that can be served as the es universe models .",
    "we deal with the solution ( [ specific ] ) in subsection ( [ sub1 ] ) as the only conserved case .",
    "we then proceed to investigate the non - conserved case ( [ case - non ] ) in subsection ( [ sub2 ] ) . in these two subsections ,",
    "radiation and cold dark matter are taken as the whole matter content of universe .",
    "finally , subsection ( [ sub3 ] ) is devoted to es solution for a perfect fluid with linear eos parameter @xmath51 and thus some required equations will be rewritten from section  [ field eqs ] . to illustrate the obtained results we shall present some diagrams .      in this case , equations ( [ form-1 ] ) , ( [ form-2 ] ) and ( [ constraint2 ] ) lead to the following equations @xmath54 and @xmath55 combining equations ( [ con-1 ] ) and ( [ con-2 ] )",
    "leaves us with the following equation for the acceleration of the universe as @xmath56 where for this case we have @xmath57 .",
    "the es solution is given by the conditions @xmath58 ,  @xmath59 and  @xmath60 .",
    "using these conditions , equation ( [ acceleration ] ) gives @xmath61 now , given the functionality of @xmath62 and @xmath63 in terms of the scale factor together with determining @xmath36 , equation ( [ radius ] ) can be solved for the scale factor of the es universe . substituting for @xmath64 ( here",
    ", we set @xmath65 as a cosmological constant ) and @xmath62 into equation ( [ radius ] ) , we get @xmath66 where we have set @xmath67 . rewriting equation ( [ radius-1 ] ) in terms of the cosmological parameters we have @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the hubble constant and @xmath70 and @xmath71 ,",
    "are present values for density parameters of radiation and cold dark matter , respectively .",
    "since @xmath72 at the present moment , equation ( [ radius-12 ] ) can be approximately solved for the radius of curvature of es universe , as @xmath73 where the superscript con is used for the related parameters of the conserved case and the solution is valid only for @xmath74 .",
    "next , we proceed to examine the stability of the solution ( [ sol - radius-1 ] ) . to this aim , using the raychaudhuri equation ( [ acceleration ] ) , we introduce phase space variables @xmath75 and @xmath76 to establish the autonomous system of equations as @xmath77 in terms of these variables , the es solution corresponds to critical point of the above dynamical system which is given as @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the stability analysis of the solution can be easily performed by finding the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix @xmath80 evaluated at the critical point .",
    "we then get , after some calculations @xmath81 this means that the fixed point @xmath82 is a saddle point which is referred to as an unstable one .",
    "in such cases , depending on the initial values of the system , some trajectories in the phase space would approach the fixed point and some others would get away from it . the phase space portrait for two different values @xmath83 and @xmath84 is drawn in fig  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the red solid circle denotes the equilibrium point @xmath82 .",
    "it is seen that , the smaller values for @xmath85 leads to smaller radius for es universe .",
    "note that , in order to show the behavior of trajectories in the phase space more accurately , we have set @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , this class of solutions does not admit a stable es universe .      in @xmath87 plane .",
    "the red solid circle represents the unstable static solution given at the point @xmath88 . ]      in this case , using equations ( [ form-1 ] ) and ( [ form-2 ] ) for the non - conserved case and setting @xmath90 , ( where @xmath91 is a dimensionless parameter ) we obtain the following raychaudhuri equation in terms of the hubble constant and matter density parameters as @xmath92 using the fact that @xmath93 together with setting @xmath94 , the above equation can be easily solved for the scale factor .",
    "the solution is given as @xmath95 where the superscript denotes the non - conserved case .",
    "note that this solution is only valid for @xmath96 . introducing the dynamical system variables @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the raychaudhuri equation ( [ radius-21 ] ) can be recast as @xmath97 this equation together with equation @xmath98 construct a dynamical system with the following eigenvalues @xmath99 this solution shows that the fixed point @xmath100 is a center equilibrium point .",
    "the trajectories of the system are closed curves or cycles winding around the fixed point ( see fig  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the evolution of the scale factor versus time has been also depicted in the left panel of fig  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the scale factor shows an oscillatory behavior which directly pictures the imaginary nature of the eigenvalues of the dynamical system ( [ auto-2 ] ) .",
    "the right panel indicates the trajectory in the @xmath101 plane .",
    "the plots of fig  [ fig3 ] are drawn for the initial values @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "this study shows that when , the condition on conservation of emt is relaxed , @xmath0 gravity can contain a stable es solution .              for a single barotropic perfect fluid with @xmath3 and choosing @xmath106 , the constraint equation ( [ relation ] ) reduces to @xmath107 in this case the friedmann equations",
    "can be obtained as follows @xmath108}\\frac{t}{3w-1}-\\frac{\\alpha h}{2}\\bigg{\\}}-\\frac{3}{a^{2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath109 eliminating the spatial curvature term , we arrive at an equation in terms of the hubble parameter and the trace terms @xmath110 note that in equations ( [ relation - w])-([h - t ] ) , the prime denotes derivative with respect to the trace and the argument of the function @xmath36 has been dropped . by determining the function @xmath36 , equations ( [ relation - w ] ) and ( [ h - t ] )",
    "make an autonomous system of differential equations for which applying the conditions @xmath111 , gives the related critical points .",
    "taking the power law form @xmath112 , yields the following values for the scale factor and emt trace at equilibrium point @xmath113 where denotes the barotropic perfect fluid .",
    "the eigenvalues of the system ( [ relation - w ] ) and ( [ h - t ] ) are obtained as @xmath114}\\big{(}1+w(2\\beta-3)\\big{)}\\mathfrak{t}^{1/(1-\\beta)}\\bigg{\\}}^{1/2},\\nn & y=(3w-1)\\big{[}2(1 - 3w)-\\big{(}1 + 2w+9w^{2}\\big{)}\\beta+2 ( 1 + w ) ( 1 + 3 w)\\beta^{2}\\big{]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath115 . the eigenvalues ( [ eig - w ] )",
    "imply that the critical point corresponding to ( [ criticals ] ) and ( [ criticals1 ] ) is a saddle one which is an unstable equilibrium point",
    ". however , if the expression under curly brackets is set to be negative , the numerator @xmath116 would be pure imaginary and as a result we have a center equilibrium point . in fig  [ fig4 ] , we have sketched the region in the parameter space @xmath117 that satisfies the condition @xmath118 ( see the shaded zone ) , for two values @xmath119 . hence , for specific values of @xmath120 and eos parameters , a stable es solution could exist .",
    "it is now interesting to examine whether the es universe presented above could give rise to an eu scenario . to achieve this , we need to check the solutions we have found for case iii with more scrutiny .",
    "in each model.,title=\"fig : \" ]   in each model.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "in this work we have studied the existence and stability of the es universe in @xmath0 modified gravity theories . in these theories ,",
    "the lagrangian of @xmath1 gravity is extended to include the trace of emt which in turn would allow for remarkable outcomes in the gravitational interactions .",
    "having employed a homogeneous and isotropic frlw metric with spatially positive curvature , we examined the stability of the es solution with the help of dynamical system approach .",
    "the @xmath0 function has been chosen as a linear combination of the ricci curvature scalar and an arbitrary function of emt trace , denoted as @xmath36 .",
    "two main classes of models we have established here , include : @xmath0 gravity models which respect the conservation of emt and those that do not . in the former class , the conservation of emt results in @xmath162 , for a pressure - less fluid . for this case , considering as the matter contents , a mixture of radiation and cold dark matter",
    ", an es solution can be found .",
    "however , the study of the trajectories of the related dynamical system near the critical point suggests that the es solution is unstable ( of the saddle type ) for all valid values of the coefficient @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , this class of models can not be served as a stable es solution , so that like in the gr case @xcite , a fine - tuning is required if the es state is to be the initial state of the universe for a past - eternal inflationary cosmology . in the latter class , by relaxing the condition on emt conservation and applying bianchi identity , we have obtained a covariant relation between derivatives of @xmath36 , emt and its trace .",
    "this case has been investigated under two subclasses . in the first one ,",
    "choosing @xmath163 , we obtained an es solution which is stable for @xmath96 in the sense that its dynamical behavior corresponds to a center equilibrium point . in the second one , we have considered a perfect fluid with linear eos ( @xmath51 ) as the matter content .",
    "choosing the function @xmath164 , we showed that a stable es universe could indeed exist , in the same sense as the previous case , depending on the values of the parameters @xmath133 , @xmath165 and @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , the second class of solutions suggest that the universe in @xmath0 modified gravity can remain at a stable state past - eternally , and may go through a series of infinite non - singular oscillations around this state .",
    "we then conclude that , in contrast to @xmath1 gravity in which , unstable es solutions do generally exist  @xcite , @xmath0 modified gravity could potentially admit stable es solutions for some specific forms of @xmath0 function .",
    "finally , as we near to close this paper , there remain two points that beg some additional elucidation .",
    "firstly , the stable es solutions we have found raise this question that , in order to have a successful cosmological scenario , the regime of infinite cycles around the center equilibrium points must be able to eventually break and then enters the current expanding phase of the universe @xcite .",
    "this purpose can be achieved by varying one of the model parameters , namely the eos parameter @xmath133 and the dimensionless parameter @xmath91 , so that the system could undergo a bifurcation which results in changing the topological structure of the phase space ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . in the current study",
    ", we observed that the equilibrium point for case iii could be stable or unstable depending on the value of @xmath133 parameter .",
    "we then assumed that this parameter changes for a short period of time during which , the center equilibrium point converts to an unstable point or correspondingly the phase of the universe changes from an infinite number of oscillations about the es state to an inflationary regime .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 models presented here can provide a setting in which an es universe is connected to an asymptotic eu scenario .",
    "secondly , in order to be sure that the universe can stay at the static state past - eternally , therefore allowing for a successful implementation of the emergent scenario , the es solution must be stable against all types of perturbations . in this",
    "regard , we have performed homogeneous and linear scalar perturbations in the scale factor and energy density and it is found that the es universe is stable against these type of perturbations under a variety of the obtained conditions .",
    "it is also of interest to extend our results to include the inhomogeneous perturbations around the es state which indeed could provide a richer structure for stability / instability analysis of einstein cosmos in @xmath0 modified gravity theory .",

    "<S> , we study the existence and stability of es universe in the context of @xmath0 modified theories of gravity . considering specific forms of @xmath0 function , we seek for the existence of solutions representing es state . using dynamical system techniques along with numerical analysis , we find two classes of solutions : the first one is always unstable of the saddle type while the second is always stable so that its dynamical behavior corresponds to a center equilibrium point . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of the second class of solutions is due to the significant duty they have in constructing non - singular emergent models in which the universe could have experienced past - eternally , a series of infinite oscillations about such an initial static state after which , it enters through a suitable physical mechanism , to an inflationary era . considering specific forms for the functionality of @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> we show that this theory is capable of providing cosmological solutions which admit emergent universe ( eu ) scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate homogeneous scalar perturbations for the mentioned models . </S>",
    "<S> the stability regions of the solutions are parametrized by a linear equation of state ( eos ) parameter and other free parameters that will be introduced for the models . </S>",
