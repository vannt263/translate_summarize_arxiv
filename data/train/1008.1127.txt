    "providing an explicit definition of time is an extremely difficult endeavor , although it does seem to be intimately related to change , an idea reflected in aristotle s famous metaphor : _ time is the moving image of eternity _ @xcite . in fact , one may encounter many reflections and philosophical considerations on time over the ages , culminating in newton s notion of absolute time .",
    "newton stated that time flowed at the same rate for all observers in the universe .",
    "but , in 1905 , einstein changed altogether our notion of time .",
    "time flowed at different rates for different observers , and minkowski , three years later , formally united the parameters of time and space , giving rise to the notion of a four - dimensional entity , spacetime . adopting a pragmatic point of view , this assumption seems reasonable , as to measure time a changing configuration of matter is needed , i.e. , a swinging pendulum , etc .",
    "change seems to be imperative to have an emergent notion of time .",
    "therefore , time is empirically related to change . but change can be considered as a variation or sequence of occurrences @xcite .",
    "thus , intuitively , a sequence of successive occurrences provides us with a notion of something that flows , i.e. , it provides us with the notion of _ time_. time flows and everything relentlessly moves along this stream . in relativity , we can substitute the above empirical notion of a sequence of occurrences by a sequence of _",
    "we idealize the concept of an event to become a point in space and an instant in time . following this reasoning of thought , a sequence of events has a determined _ temporal order_. we experimentally verify that specific events occur before others and not vice - versa .",
    "certain events ( effects ) are triggered off by others ( causes ) , providing us with the notion of _",
    "causality_.    thus , the conceptual definition and understanding of time , both quantitatively and qualitatively is of the utmost difficulty and importance .",
    "special relativity provides us with important quantitative elucidations of the fundamental processes related to time dilation effects .",
    "the general theory of relativity ( gtr ) provides a deep analysis to effects of time flow in the presence of strong and weak gravitational fields @xcite . as time",
    "is incorporated into the proper structure of the fabric of spacetime , it is interesting to note that gtr is contaminated with non - trivial geometries which generate _ closed timelike curves _",
    "a closed timelike curve ( ctc ) allows time travel , in the sense that an observer which travels on a trajectory in spacetime along this curve , returns to an event which coincides with the departure .",
    "the arrow of time leads forward , as measured locally by the observer , but globally he / she may return to an event in the past .",
    "this fact apparently violates causality , opening pandora s box and producing time travel paradoxes @xcite , throwing a veil over our understanding of the fundamental nature of time .",
    "the notion of causality is fundamental in the construction of physical theories , therefore time travel and it s associated paradoxes have to be treated with great caution .",
    "the paradoxes fall into two broad groups , namely the _ consistency paradoxes _ and the _ causal loops_.    the consistency paradoxes include the classical grandfather paradox .",
    "imagine traveling into the past and meeting one s grandfather . nurturing homicidal tendencies , the time traveler murders his grandfather , impeding the birth of his father , therefore making his own birth impossible .",
    "in fact , there are many versions of the grandfather paradox , limited only by one s imagination .",
    "the consistency paradoxes occur whenever possibilities of changing events in the past arise .",
    "the paradoxes associated to causal loops are related to self - existing information or objects , trapped in spacetime .",
    "imagine a time traveler going back to his past , handing his younger self a manual for the construction of a time machine .",
    "the younger version then constructs the time machine over the years , and eventually goes back to the past to give the manual to his younger self .",
    "the time machine exists in the future because it was constructed in the past by the younger version of the time traveler .",
    "the construction of the time machine was possible because the manual was received from the future .",
    "both parts considered by themselves are consistent , and the paradox appears when considered as a whole .",
    "one is liable to ask , what is the origin of the manual , for it apparently surges out of nowhere .",
    "there is a manual never created , nevertheless existing in spacetime , although there are no causality violations .",
    "an interesting variety of these causal loops was explored by gott and li  @xcite , where they analyzed the idea of whether there is anything in the laws of physics that would prevent the universe from creating itself .",
    "thus , tracing backwards in time through the original inflationary state a region of ctcs may be encountered , giving _ no _ first - cause .",
    "a great variety of solutions to the einstein field equations ( efes ) containing ctcs exist , but , two particularly notorious features seem to stand out .",
    "solutions with a tipping over of the light cones due to a rotation about a cylindrically symmetric axis ; and solutions that violate the energy conditions of gtr , which are fundamental in the singularity theorems and theorems of classical black hole thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "a great deal of attention has also been paid to the quantum aspects of closed timelike curves @xcite .    throughout this paper , we use the notation @xmath0 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the tipping over of light cones seems to be a generic feature of some solutions with a rotating cylindrical symmetry .",
    "the general metric for a stationary , axisymmetric solution with rotation is given by @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the distance along the axis of rotation ; @xmath3 is the angular coordinate ; @xmath4 is the radial coordinate ; and @xmath5 is the temporal coordinate .",
    "the metric components are only functions of the radial coordinate @xmath4 .",
    "note that the determinant , @xmath6 , is lorentzian provided that @xmath7 .    due to the periodic nature of the angular coordinate , @xmath3 , an azimuthal curve with @xmath8 is a closed curve of invariant length @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath10 is negative then the integral curve with @xmath11 fixed is a ctc . if @xmath12 , then the azimuthal curve is a closed null curve .",
    "now , consider a null azimuthal curve , not necessarily a geodesic nor closed , in the @xmath13 plane with @xmath14 fixed .",
    "the null condition , @xmath15 , implies @xmath16 with @xmath17 . solving the quadratic , we have @xmath18    due to the lorentzian signature constraint , @xmath19 , the roots are real .",
    "if @xmath20 then the light cones are tipped over sufficiently far to permit a trip to the past . by going once around the azimuthal direction ,",
    "the total backward time - jump for a null curve is @xmath21 if @xmath20 for even a single value of @xmath4 , the chronology - violation region covers the entire spacetime @xcite .",
    "thus , the tilting of light cones are generic features of spacetimes which contain ctcs , as depicted in fig . [ tipcones ] .",
    "the present section is far from making an exhaustive search of all the efe solutions generating ctcs with these features , but the best known spacetimes will be briefly analyzed , namely , the van stockum spacetime , the gdel universe , the spinning cosmic strings and the gott two - string time machine , which is a variation on the theme of the spinning cosmic string .      the earliest solution to the efes containing ctcs , is probably that of the van stockum spacetime , which describes a stationary , cylindrically symmetric solution of a rapidly rotating infinite cylinder of dust , surrounded by vacuum .",

    "nevertheless , li has shown given an example of a spacetime containing a time machine that might be stable against vacuum fluctuations of matter fields  @xcite , implying that hawking s suggestion that the vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields acting as a chronology protection might break down .",
    "there is no convincing demonstration of the chronology protection conjecture , but the hope exists that a future theory of quantum gravity may prohibit ctcs .",
    "visser still considers the possibility of two other conjectures @xcite .",
    "the first is the radical reformulation of physics conjecture , in which one abandons the causal structure of the laws of physics and allows , without restriction , time travel , reformulating physics from the ground up .",
    "the second is the boring physics conjecture , in which one simply ceases to consider the solutions to the efes generating ctcs .",
    "perhaps an eventual quantum gravity theory will provide us with the answers .",

    "<S> the conceptual definition and understanding of time , both quantitatively and qualitatively is of the utmost difficulty and importance . as time </S>",
    "<S> is incorporated into the proper structure of the fabric of spacetime , it is interesting to note that general relativity is contaminated with non - trivial geometries which generate _ closed timelike curves_. a closed timelike curve ( ctc ) allows time travel , in the sense that an observer that travels on a trajectory in spacetime along this curve , may return to an event before his departure . </S>",
    "<S> this fact apparently violates causality , therefore time travel and it s associated paradoxes have to be treated with great caution . </S>",
    "<S> the paradoxes fall into two broad groups , namely the _ consistency paradoxes _ and the _ causal loops_. a great variety of solutions to the einstein field equations containing ctcs exist and it seems that two particularly notorious features stand out . </S>",
    "<S> solutions with a tipping over of the light cones due to a rotation about a cylindrically symmetric axis and solutions that violate the energy conditions . </S>",
    "<S> all these aspects are analyzed in this review paper . </S>"
