    "transition - metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) have been investigated for the last five decades , mostly for applications in catalysis and as lubricants.@xcite tmds form a class of materials with the formula tx@xmath0 , where t is a transition metal from groups iv  vi ( e.g.  mo , ti , nb ) , and x is a chalcogen atom ( s , se , or te ) .",

    "x , with a plane of metal atoms covalently bound to two planes of chalcogen atoms .",
    "adjacent layers are held together by weak interlayer interactions , what allows exfoliation of individual tx@xmath0 slabs .",
    "the electronic properties of bulk tmds range from metallic to semiconducting , depending on the metal type .    in 2011 , tmd materials have gained renewed interest after the successful production of two - dimensional ( 2d ) large - area single layers ( 1@xmath1 ) using liquid exfoliation.@xcite semiconducting tmd monolayers offer properties that are distinct from those of their parental bulk forms .",
    "such layer - dependent properties have recently attracted great attention for possible applications in nano- and optoelectronics .",
    "several semiconducting tmds undergo a transition from the indirect band gap 2@xmath1 forms to the direct band gap 1@xmath1-monolayers , as e.g.  in the case of mos@xmath0 , the prototypical tmd material.@xcite quantum confinement to single layers increases the electronic band gap by about 0.51.0  ev , shifting the light absorption from the near - infrared to the visible - light range .",
    "recently , these novel 2d systems have been used to fabricate first 1@xmath1-mos@xmath0 field - effect transistors ( fets ) , logical circuits and amplifiers.@xcite further studies have revealed that tmds are highly flexible under tensile strain and exhibit excellent pliability,@xcite which could be used together with elastic - polymer substrates for development of flexible electronic devices .    similar to carbon , tmds form tubular and fullerene - like nanostructures.@xcite though less than their carbon counterparts , in particular mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 nanoonions and nanotubes have been investigated both theoretically and experimentally.@xcite single - walled tmd nanotubes ( swtmd nts ) have interesting electronic properties that depend on their diameter and chirality . while zigzag ( @xmath2,0 ) nts",
    "are direct band gap semiconductors resembling 1@xmath1 forms , the armchair ( @xmath2,@xmath2 ) nts are closer to the 2@xmath1 structures.@xcite increasing the tube diameter , the band gap increases and for diameters larger than 40    it approaches the single - layer limit .",
    "tmd nts have been investigated for their mechanical properties under tensile strain using atomic force microscopy.@xcite linear strain - stress relation until fracture suggests plastic deformations , and fracture is directly related to the formation of local defects.@xcite while the change of electronic properties under strain has been investigated theoretically for tmd monolayers@xcite , they remain to be explored for the associated tubular structures . as the experimental setup for direct tensile tests of nanotubes is state - of - the - art,@xcite the application of tensile stress on 2d tmd systems is rather difficult due to the excellent lubricating properties of these materials .    here",
    ", we estimate the electronic , vibrational and electromechanical properties of large - diameter mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 nts , using a simple structural model assuming the walls to be planar ( see fig .",

    "we approximate the single - walled nt ( swnt ) by the 1@xmath1-monolayer , the outer wall of the multi - walled nts ( mwnts ) , as well as a hypothetical double - walled nt ( dwnt ) , by the 2@xmath1 bilayer , and the inner walls of the mwnts by the 2@xmath1 bulk structure .",
    "these calculations are relevant for typical experimental mwnt , and the limit for small tubes we have reported earlier.@xcite     structure models of tmd nts : ( a ) monolayer represents single - walled nanotubes , ( b ) bulk and bilayer represent inner and outer walls of multi - walled nts , respectively .",

    "we employ density - functional theory ( dft ) for all vibrational and electronic structure calculations and the density - functional based tight - binding ( dftb ) method for quantum transport calculations ( see methods ) .",
    "the systems are subject to tensile strain up to an elongation of 16  % , that is before first structural defects occur",
    ". we will demonstrate that the individual walls of mwnts contribute equally , proportional to their diameter , to the electronic transport , and that strain has a homogeneous effect on the structures .",
    "we further demonstrate that raman spectroscopy is an ideal tool to monitor the tensile tests in experiment , as the wavenumber reduces almost linearly by about 3  @xmath3 per percent of strain for the e@xmath4 mode .",
    "in the rectangular representation , the @xmath5 and @xmath6 lattice vectors are independent ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bz ] ) and refer to tensile strain along armchair and zigzag directions , respectively .",
    "since we work with rectangular models , the first brillouin zone ( bz ) changes comparing with the hexagonal symmetry ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bz ] ) .",
    "the bz of our models is constructed by a proper folding of the hexagonal bz to the rectangular one,@xcite where the @xmath7 point in the hexagonal bz is folded into the middle of the line that connects it to the @xmath8 point . in the rectangular bz ,",
    "this point is located at 2/3 of the symmetry line between @xmath8 and @xmath9 points , and the @xmath9 and @xmath10 points indicate the zone edges .",

    "for the ( @xmath2,0 ) nts these @xmath13-paths are reversed .",
    "since the fundamental band gap is positioned along the @xmath8@xmath7 line for the 1@xmath1- and 2@xmath1-tmds , @xmath18 of ( @xmath2,@xmath2 ) nts is obtained by sampling along the tube axis , while for the ( @xmath2,0 ) nts we need to sample the circumference .",

    "the amount of applied strain is indicated as percentage relative to the lattice vectors . ]    as in the planar structures , @xmath18 increases with reducing the number of layers , reaching about 2.0  ev for single - layers , while the indirect band gap transforms into a direct one.@xcite thus , only hypothetical swnts , and possibly mwnts with alternating layer compositions , may show direct band gaps .",
    "slight mechanical deformation of the swnts would result in a change of the direct band gap back to the indirect one , located between @xmath8 and @xmath7 high - symmetry points , similarly to the monolayers.@xcite a general property is that tensile strain ( @xmath19 ) linearly reduces @xmath18 . at 9.0  % elongation , @xmath18 accounts for less than 50  % of its original value .",
    "this result is independent of chirality and number of layers , and is thus a global property of mwnts . further stretching results in a semiconductor - metal transition , with the valence band maximum ( vbm ) crossing the fermi level at the @xmath8 point and the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) around the @xmath7 point . while isotropic stretching of monolayers results in the metallic character of the materials for @xmath20  % , @xcite for the tubular systems this transition is observed at much larger elongations of ( @xmath2116  % ) .",
    "such large @xmath19 values are at the limit of rupture . in our simulations ,",
    "the bonding network is still intact at these values .",
    "interestingly , the dw- and mwnts behave alike under high tensile strain .",
    "the band gap evolution under tensile strain shows almost linear behavior up to about 12  % elongation ( see fig .",

    "the lattice dynamics of 2@xmath1-mos@xmath0 , and more recently also of 1@xmath1-mos@xmath0 , has been studied both experimentally and theoretically.@xcite 2@xmath1-mos@xmath0 and 2@xmath1-ws@xmath0 have five active modes , among which @xmath22 and @xmath23 are infra - red ( ir ) active , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are raman active ( see fig .

    "this results in the four corresponding active modes @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",

    "causes slight changes in the lattice dynamics ( see tab .",

    "the @xmath26 mode near 409  @xmath3 becomes softer , transforming into the @xmath31 mode near 406  @xmath3 , whereas the @xmath25 mode near 382  @xmath3 hardens , transforming into the @xmath30 mode near 383  @xmath3 .",
    "ws@xmath0 systems show very similar behavior ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : phonons_equ ] ) .",
    "in contrast to quantum confinement , mechanical deformations strongly alter the lattice dynamics . for a series of strains we have calculated the raman - active @xmath25 ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath26 ( @xmath31 ) modes and compared them with those of the equilibrium structures ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : phonons ] ) .",
    "as expected , for both types of active modes , the frequencies reduce with applied strain , whereas they increase under compression .",
    "the frequency change is almost linear over a long range of elongations and similar for different chiralities up to a strain of @xmath218  % .",
    "the slope of this frequency change is about -3 @xmath3 per percent of strain for the @xmath25 ( @xmath30 ) modes and -1 @xmath3 per percent of strain for the @xmath33 ( @xmath31 ) modes ( see table s1 in the supporting information ) .",

    "while for the isotropic stretching of 1@xmath1-tmds the transport channels are available already at @xmath19 = 1011  % , @xcite for nanotubes these numbers shift to @xmath211516  % .",

    "intrinsic quantum conductance of mos@xmath0 ( a ) and ws@xmath0 ( b ) of nts and layered materials under tensile strain . ]",
    "the intensity of the quantum conductance below the fermi level reduces with applied strain .",
    "the average @xmath14 values at @xmath34 -1.0  ev for 15.8  % of elongation are nearly half of those of the equilibrium systems ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : conduct ] ) .",
    "however , for the energies above the fermi level , chirality matters and @xmath14 is higher in the case of ( @xmath2,@xmath2 ) tubes .",
    "for large tubes , quantum confinement will not alter the electronic properties due to the different tube diameters,@xcite but it plays a role for the outermost walls of mwnts . quantum confinement to the monolayer would be present in swnts , and possibly also for recently reported mwnts with alternating layer compositions that are available for some stoichiometries,@xcite but , so far , not for pure ts@xmath0 nts . as for 2d materials , quantum confinement to single - walled tubes would result in direct band - gap semiconductors with @xmath18 occurring at the @xmath7 point.@xcite for smaller tubes , the band gap type depends on the tube chirality , i.e. the ( @xmath2,0 ) tmd swnts are direct - band gap materials , while the ( @xmath2,@xmath2 ) ones exhibit indirect @xmath18 between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which changes slowly to direct - band gap for larger tube diameters.@xcite this supports the choice of our layered models to represent the large - diameter tmd nts .",
    "tensile strain along the tube axis reduces @xmath18 almost linearly and , for @xmath35 16  % , it closes and a semiconductor - metal transition occurs .",
    "the phonon dispersion is only slightly affected by the position of the individual tube within the mwnts , as similarly found for the small but apparent quantum confinement effect for layered tmds .",
    "single - walled tubes exhibit slightly softer out - of - plane @xmath31 and stronger in - plane @xmath30 modes .",
    "those results are in very good agreement with a large number of available experimental data on layered tmds , e.g.  for the in - plane mode it agrees within @xmath213  @xmath3 of difference for mos@xmath0 and @xmath215  @xmath3 for ws@xmath0.@xcite the results are likely to be general for the other chalcogenides , for example tongay et al.@xcite observed a similarly small increased frequency of the @xmath25 and decrease of the @xmath26 modes for mose@xmath0 layers from raman measurements .",
    "those results indicate that the weak interlayer interactions in tx@xmath0 materials can not be associated with the van der waals interactions only , but most probably with coulomb electrostatic interactions as well.@xcite    most theoretical results reported in the literature agree that the quantum confinement effect on the phonon dispersion is rather small .",
    "for example , molina - sanchez et al.@xcite reported the softening of @xmath26 ( from 412.0 to 410.3  @xmath3 ) and hardening of @xmath25 ( from 387.8 to 391.7  @xmath3 ) modes , based on lda - dft calculations .",
    "ataca et al.@xcite obtained rather different results on the basis of london dispersion corrected dft ( pw91 functional ) , and attributed this discrepancy to a rather poor description of the lattice geometry at this level of theory .",
    "the phonon dispersion results for the unstrained structures imply that the thermal properties , such as heat capacity and transport along the tubes , scale linearly with the amount of tube material .",
    "they also imply that vibrational spectra of bulk tmd material and mwnt would be very similar , with slight broadening of the signals for the mwnt .",
    "tensile strain does have a strong effect on the phonon dispersion .",
    "it causes softening of the in - plane @xmath27 modes by @xmath213  @xmath3 per percent of strain , and of the out - of - plane @xmath28 modes by @xmath211  @xmath3 per percent of strain .",
    "after about @xmath355  % , the phonon frequency become dependent on the chirality .",
    "both , the @xmath36 and @xmath37 modes are raman active .",
    "hence , raman spectroscopy qualifies as an excellent tool to monitor tensile tests of tmds , both in 2d and in tubular forms . for 2d materials",
    ", strain may be induced by elongation of an appropriate substrate , e.g. by uniform mechanical strain , or by using a material with high thermal expansion coefficient and varying the temperature .",
    "for tmd mwnt , tensile tests have been reported by various groups . however , to date , it is not perfectly clear whether inner and outer walls are stretched simultaneously , or rather the outer walls slide on the inner ones . the latter hypothesis would result in a broadening of the raman signals , while the first one would leave the signal widths rather unaffected . in any case",
    ", there would be a shift of the raman signals that can serve as precise scale for determining the strain .",
    "we have observed exactly the same trends for mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 nanotubes , both for interlayer interactions and tube stretching . comparing the influence of the two different transition metals , the phonon frequencies of ws@xmath0",
    "are generally lower compared to the corresponding mos@xmath0 values , what we rationalize with the larger mass of tungsten atoms and their resulting lower vibrations .",
    "the notable exception is the @xmath26 mode ( @xmath31 in 2d ) , where only the sulfur atoms are vibrating and the frequency is , therefore , affected just by the strength of the t  s covalent bond.@xcite significant lowering of the frequency ( by 5060  @xmath3 ) of the @xmath22 , @xmath25 , and @xmath23 modes in ws@xmath0 is due to the fact that these modes include both vibrations of the metal and chalcogen atoms .",
    "the difference between the @xmath25 ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath26 ( @xmath31 ) is now 3 - 4 times larger than in the case of mos@xmath0 .",
    "our quantum transport calculations aim to describe the intrinsic conductance of the entire tubes along their principal symmetry axis .",
    "conductance normal to the tube axis has not been studied in this work .",
    "our results show that the transport channels are completely delocalized within the individual walls that compose the mwnt , both for the equilibrium structures and for the strained tubes , even for those strongly strained ones that show zero electronic band gap .",
    "thus , tmd nts exhibit a truly metallic character if strained by @xmath2116  % .",
    "it should be noted that band structures , densities of states and phonon dispersion relations have been calculated at the pbe - dft level , while the quantum conductance calculations employ the dftb method , an approximation to dft . while - though somewhat surprisingly - the pbe results give very accurate band gaps for tmd materials,@xcite thorough testing of the dftb parameters@xcite show an overestimation of the band gap , expressed by a uniform shift of the conduction band to higher levels , while the band forms and thus all other electronic properties are in excellent agreement with dft .",
    "so , the dftb values for the conduction band should be shifted to lower values , leading to an open transport channel and hence to a truly metallic character in the unbiased @xmath2116% stretched mwnts .",
    "the quantum conductance per individual nanotube is about twice higher in mwnts compared to the corresponding swnt .",
    "only slight differences in conductivity are observed between the outer and the inner tube walls , provided that they are subject to the same strain .",
    "thus , the entire cross section of the strained or biased mwnts may serve as conductor if contacted appropriately .",
    "the quantum conductance results agree very well with our electronic structure calculations ( cf .",
    "[ fig : bs ] ) and with recent experimental data : indeed , the mobility and conductivity of mos@xmath0 thin films increase from mono- to bilayer.@xcite the electric double layer transistors ( edlt ) , fabricated by zhang and co - workers , showed an electron mobility of 86  @xmath38 v@xmath39 s@xmath39 and a high electron density of 10@xmath40  @xmath38 , which leads to effective electron transport in the edlt .@xcite kim et al.@xcite have pointed out that a multi - layer mos@xmath0 shows a notably higher current flow in the ballistic regime compared to a single layer device .",
    "this can be attributed to the larger number of transport channels available for the electron flow in the multi - layered mos@xmath0 based junctions .",
    "we estimate that the above results should be transferable to the tubular models , where the mwnts will reveal better transport properties than the swnts .    in conclusion",
    ", we have investigated the electronic and lattice response to the tensile strain of tmd nanotubes with different number of layers .",
    "large - diameter nanotubes can be approximated with layered systems as their properties should be nearly the same at the scale .",
    "our findings suggest that we can control electronic properties of tmd nts and layers by an external tensile strain for nanoelectromechanical applications .",
    "raman spectroscopy is an excellent tool to monitor the effect of strain in the samples .",
    "for large - diameter nanotubes , three structural models are needed to describe the individual walls : a swnt corresponds to a monolayer , a dwnt to a bilayer . for a mwnt",
    ", we distinguish the outermost wall , represented by a bilayer and the inner walls , that are modeled by the bulk material .",

    "<S> the transition - metal dichalcogenides ( tmd ) mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 show remarkable electromechanical properties . </S>",
    "<S> strain modifies the direct band gap into an indirect one , and substantial strain even induces an semiconductor - metal transition . providing strain through mechanical contacts is difficult for tmd monolayers , but state - of - the - art for tmd nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> we show using density - functional theory that similar electromechanical properties as in monolayer and bulk tmds are found for large diameter tmd single- ( swnt ) and multi - walled nanotubes ( mwnts ) . </S>",
    "<S> the semiconductor - metal transition occurs at elongations of 16  % . </S>",
    "<S> we show that raman spectroscopy is an excellent tool to determine the strain of the nanotubes and hence monitor the progress of that nanoelectromechanical experiment _ in situ_. tmd mwnts show twice the electric conductance compared to swnts , and each wall of the mwnts contributes to the conductance proportional to its diameter . </S>"
