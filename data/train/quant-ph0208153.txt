    "various tasks of quantum information processing require the use of quantum networks which realise desired quantum operations on a chosen input state .",
    "the networks may be formed by arrays of elementary gates , realising single or two particle operations . with increasing complexity",
    ", it will become important to locate a possible error that can cause the malfunctioning of the whole network .",
    "the error , or erroneous gate , could be found by measuring its properties using some estimation strategy @xcite .",
    "the estimation of a whole set of gates , however , might be rather time consuming .",
    "moreover , we may not be interested in what the error is , only if there is an error or not .",
    "therefore , it will be better to perform a simpler check only to see whether the gate performs correctly or not .",
    "this leads us to consider testing whether two gates are the same or different by _ comparing _ them to each other .",
    "similarly it might be favorable to test gates on a production line when a master gate is available .",
    "the produced gates could then simply be compared to the master gate , and if a deviation in the behaviour of the gate is found , it will be discarded .",
    "transformation comparison is closely related to state comparison @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will discuss strategies for comparing unitary transforms .",
    "the choice of comparison strategy will naturally depend on what is already known about the transforms , and also on the resources available for the test . in the present work , a restriction is made to when each transform may be used only once , and to when the transforms are completely unknown .",
    "other situations will be commented upon at the end .",
    "the focus will also be on unambiguous transformation comparison , meaning that whenever a result `` different '' or `` same '' is obtained , the result is also correct . in general ,",
    "this forces us to accept inconclusive comparison outcomes , giving no information @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to compare unitary transformations using other types of strategies , such as minimum - error comparison strategies .",
    "we will return to this possibility at the end .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that any unambiguous , minimum - error , or any other type of comparison strategy , would have to involve the action of the transforms to be compared upon some test state , followed by a measurement ( or measurements ) of the changed test state . to be more specific",
    ", we have to build a network where each transform occurs once , feed a test quantum state through the network , and then measure the output state .",
    "the transforms may be used in any way inside the network ; in parallel , acting on different qubits or particles , in series , acting on a particle one transform after the other , or possibly even in the form of controlled - u operations .",
    "this picture includes the possibility of entanglement with an environment , for example , the case where two transforms u and v act in some way on two particles , which may be entangled with other particles ( or with each other ) . to be general , one should also allow for sequential measurements , with actions conditional on previous measurement results .",
    "as we allow each transform to be used only once , sequential measurements will be of limited use .    to be able to say anything definite and unambiguous about whether the transforms are the same or different",
    ", we have to choose the test state and the network in such a way that certain output results are _ unambiguously _ associated with the transforms being the same or different . from this point of view , it is clear that , if the unitary transforms are completely unknown , a comparison can never give the definite answer that the transforms ( two or more ) are identical . to obtain this information",
    ", we would have to reliably distinguish between the case when the transforms are exactly the same , and when they are arbitrarily close , but still not identical .",
    "that this is not possible can be seen by a continuity argument similar to the one for state comparison @xcite .",
    "the transforms being the same would have to be associated with the output state lying in a certain known subspace @xmath0 of the total allowed state space .",
    "when the transforms are almost , but not completely identical , the output state @xmath1 will lie almost , but not completely , in this subspace : @xmath2 where @xmath3 lies in the subspace @xmath0 , and @xmath4 lies in the complementary subspace . by making the transformations arbitrarily close",
    ", @xmath5 can be made arbitrarily small , and there is no measurement that would distinguish unambiguously between @xmath6 and @xmath1 for any arbitrarily small @xmath5 .",
    "such a measurement would have to contain a measurement operator @xmath7 for which , with a finite success probability @xmath8 to detect the transforms as `` same '' ,",
    "@xmath9 this forces the probability @xmath8 to be zero , meaning that we can never unambiguously determine a set of transformations to be identical , unless we have additional information about the transforms , for example , that they belong to a certain given set of transforms .",
    "in contrast , it is possible to obtain the unambiguous knowledge that the transformations are different . to treat",
    "the problem in its full generality , with the transforms to be compared appearing in an arbitrary network as described above , is difficult .",
    "we will limit the discussion to the case when the transforms appear in parallel , as shown for two transforms @xmath10 and @xmath11 in fig .",
    "( [ fig : uvnet ] ) .",
    "an input state is sent through a preparation network , then acted upon by @xmath10 and @xmath11 as shown , and finally measured .",
    "we have to be able to associate certain outcomes unambiguously with the transforms being different .",
    "we will first concentrate on comparing two single qubit transformations .",
    "these represent the simplest elements of quantum networks , and the ideas involved are demonstrated in a clear way . here",
    "we present different comparison strategies , one using only a single qubit as a test state , and another strategy involving two qubits in a singlet state .",
    "these are shown to succeed more often than a third strategy using two nonentangled qubits .",
    "the strategies will then be generalised to comparison of more than two transforms , and to transforms of higher dimension .",
    "we end with conclusions .",
    "we will start with comparing two unknown single qubit transformations @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "a general way of parametrising @xmath12 unitary transforms is to write them as @xmath13-transforms with a global phase , @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "we see that four real parameters suffice to determine each transform .",
    "the global phase will matter whenever a unitary transform may or may not be applied to a physical system , such as in an interferometric setup , or in a controlled - u gate . for this reason , we can not regard transforms which have different global phases , but otherwise are identical , as equivalent . surprisingly enough",
    ", it is found that a single particle test state is enough to test , in a single run , for differences in three of these four degrees of freedom .",
    "we will also consider the effect of entanglement using a two particle singlet test state , contrasting this method to a two particle non - entangled strategy .",
    "assume that , apart from two single copies of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , only one test qubit is available .",
    "let us for the moment think about photons , with the two qubit basis states being horizontal and vertical polarisation , although the discussion applies to any two - level system .",
    "a strong reason for considering what may be done with only one test particle is that any unitary transform , acting on one photon , may be achieved with linear optical elements .",
    "this means that it will be possible to realise in an experiment any single - qubit test strategy .",
    "we will start by considering one intuitive example strategy , then generalising the argument to obtain an optimal single particle comparison strategy . as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : onephot ] ) , we may for example split the photon with a beam splitter , not necessarily 50/50 , let @xmath10 and @xmath11 act in one path each , recombine the two paths with another beam splitter , not necessarily identical to the first , and detect in which path and with what polarisation the photon exits .",
    "phase shifts , not included in the figure , may be added at any point in the network .",
    "the first beam splitter can be thought of merely as a state preparation device .",
    "a general single photon test state is @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the basis states of the photon in the paths going through @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and latexmath:[$|c|^2+|d|^2+|e|^2 +    preparation network built with polarising and non - polarising beam splitters , phase shifts and polarisation rotations .",

    "the detection can be effected by recombining the two paths by a second non - polarising beam splitter with the matrix @xmath27 written in the ( @xmath28 ) basis , meaning that if @xmath20 , the output state is @xmath29 whenever the photon is exiting in the @xmath30 path , @xmath10 and @xmath11 must have been different .",
    "note that even if @xmath10 and @xmath11 are not identical , the photon may be found in path @xmath31 .",
    "we can calculate the success rate for detecting the two transformations as different .",

    "is due to the fact that the dimension of the subspace spanned by the states ( [ eq : diffstates ] ) is two out of a total of four dimensions .",
    "integrating over all possible @xmath10 and @xmath11 corresponds to integrating over all possible output states ( [ eq : genstate ] ) in the four - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "projecting onto two of these four dimensions obviously restricts the integration to these two dimensions , yielding @xmath49 .",
    "the result obtained is not dependent on the polarisation of the state @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : inex ] ) .",
    "any other basis is equally suited .",
    "in general , what we have to find is measurement states @xmath51 orthogonal to the state @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : samestate ] ) .",
    "the fact that the orthogonality has to hold for all possible @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath39 leads to the condition @xmath55 giving @xmath56 this means that the polarisation in the two paths has to be the same , but any polarisation will do .",
    "the measurement states have to be adjusted according to ( [ eq : ortcond ] ) to match the polarisation of the test state .",
    "the probability to detect a difference will be optimal when the probabilities for the photon to be in each path are equal , both equal to 1/2 .",
    "thus our intuitive first example of strategy with the test state ( [ eq : inex ] ) proved to be one of the optimal one - photon test strategies with a test state of the form ( [ eq : in ] ) .",
    "let us note that the single photon strategy fails to detect a difference in @xmath10 and @xmath11 whenever @xmath57 without the transforms being identical .",
    "if we write @xmath58 and @xmath59 , with @xmath60 , the strategy fails to distinguish the transforms characterized by @xmath61 and @xmath62 , for any @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , it effectively detects differences in three parameters out of the four necessary to parametrize a general single qubit unitary transformation .",
    "it is of course possible to apply a mixed strategy , using two or more different polarisations for the test state , for example , a choice of two different polarisations with probability 1/2 each .",
    "one will then have a nonzero probability of detecting any kind of difference in @xmath10 and @xmath11 , even if the overall difference detection probability does not increase .",
    "it is possible to further generalise the argument to any strategy where at most one particle passes through @xmath10 or @xmath11 , but allowing for example entanglement with an environment .",
    "the general input state then reads @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 refer to single photons in the @xmath31 or @xmath30 path .",
    "the vacuum state @xmath67 denotes that no photons are present in the @xmath31 or @xmath30 path .",
    "the states @xmath68 are arbitrary but fixed environment states , describing the state of any particles which @xmath10 and @xmath11 will not explicitly act on , and may be selected so as to optimise the strategy .",
    "the constants @xmath69 and @xmath70 , whose absolute values sum to 1 , are also chosen to optimise the strategy .    the transforms @xmath10 and @xmath11 are then allowed to act in their respective paths , giving an output state @xmath71 exactly as before . by measuring @xmath71",
    ", we now have to judge whether @xmath10 and @xmath11 are different or not . any generalised measurement strategy may be described as a projective measurement in a higher - dimensional hilbert space @xcite .",
    "a requirement for an unambiguous comparison strategy is therefore that there exists at least one measurement state @xmath72 which is orthogonal to the output state @xmath52 whenever @xmath10 and @xmath11 are identical . here ,",
    "@xmath73 denote environment states , and @xmath74 and @xmath75 are constants .",
    "there may exist several linearly independent measurement states , as in the explicit example above .",
    "as for the vacuum part of the general input state ( [ eq : geninp ] ) , the fact that the orthogonality condition has to hold for all @xmath35 leads to the requirement @xmath76 and although it is possible to have @xmath77 , after a quick consideration one realises that @xmath78 is optimal : due to condition ( [ eq : gcond ] ) , a nonzero @xmath70 will not contribute to the success probability , but can only decrease it , since a nonzero @xmath70 forces the absolute values of @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 to be smaller .    to investigate whether entanglement with the environment may be useful or not , let us not embark on any lengthy algebraic calculation , but instead use an intuitive argument .",
    "in the general input state ( [ eq : geninp ] ) , if @xmath83 or @xmath84 , then it is possible to obtain which - path information , that is , knowledge about whether the single photon passed through @xmath10 or @xmath11 , by a measurement on the environment .",
    "this inevitably degrades the success rate of the comparison , which relies on our inability to determine whether the photon passed through @xmath10 or @xmath11 in the same way which - path information degrades the visibility in an interferometer .",
    "we are thus led to @xmath85 and @xmath86 . on the other hand , if @xmath87 or @xmath88 with desired probabilities .",
    "if @xmath89 , the selection is made by a detection of the environment state in the latexmath:[$\\{|\\phi_c\\rangle_e ,    probability , as it is independent of the polarisation of the test state .    in applications such as dense coding @xcite , entanglement may be used to enhance the distinguishability of a set of unitary transforms .",
    "this is partly due to the enlarged hilbert space arising from having two qubits instead of one .",
    "here we have effectively enlarged the dimension of the avaliable hilbert space from two to four by introducing and extra degree of freedom  a choice of two paths  to a single qubit ( photon ) , without the explicit use of entanglement . as another option ,",
    "entanglement between two photons , one passing through @xmath10 , the other through @xmath11 , may enhance the comparison success rate , not always , but in certain cases .",
    "this will be considered next .",
    "let us consider a strategy which involves the use of a singlet state .",
    "experimentally , a singlet state of two photons may be prepared using parametric down - conversion .",

    "this requires a projection onto the antisymmetric versus the symmetric subspace , and may be implemented with a non - polarising beam splitter @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : oneave ] ) , is found to be 3/4 .",
    "this is because the measurement space , spanned by the three bell states other than the singlet , is now three - dimensional .",
    "we should note that it is also possible to start with any @xmath99 in the subspace @xmath100 indicates that the transforms were different .",
    "in this case , however , the comparison success rate will be only 1/4 , since the measurement space now has only one dimension out of four .",
    "the singlet strategy can discriminate between all possible @xmath13 transformations , but can not detect global phase differences @xmath101 .",
    "this means that , like the single photon strategy , it can detect differences in three of the four parameters .",
    "two runs of the single photon strategy with average success rate 1/2 each will have the same overall success rate , 3/4 , as one run of the singlet strategy . thus it would seem as if the use of entanglement carries limited advantage .",
    "however , in the strictest sense of the requirement `` only one use of @xmath10 and @xmath11 are allowed '' , two runs of the single photon strategy would not be permitted , even if the average number of photons passing through @xmath10 and @xmath11 is one each . also , the singlet strategy is more efficient when it comes to detecting small differences in the @xmath13 part of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "for a difference @xmath102 , the single photon and singlet strategies have difference detection probabilities of @xmath103 and @xmath104 respectively , meaning that for a small difference @xmath105 , the singlet strategy is a factor of four better than the one - photon strategy , or a factor of two better than two single photon runs . on the other hand ,",
    "the single - photon interferometric scheme is capable of detecting overall phase differences , where the singlet strategy fails .",
    "the choice of strategy depends on the type of difference to be detected .",
    "as already noted above , the single photon strategy introduces extra degrees of freedom to a single photon in allowing two different paths , so that the dimensionality of the test space for in the single photon strategy ( four ) equals that of the singlet strategy ( four ) .",
    "we may also compare the singlet strategy to a non - entangled two particle strategy based on state comparison @xcite .",
    "starting with two particles in the same state @xmath106 , apply @xmath10 to one of them and @xmath11 to the other , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonent ] .",
    "there exists no unambiguous test telling us whether the particles are still the same state , but if they are found to be different , then we can infer that @xmath10 and @xmath11 must have been different .",
    "the probability for this strategy to succeed in detecting a difference in @xmath107 and @xmath108 is @xcite @xmath109 choosing @xmath110 ( the integrated overall success probability can not depend on the state chosen if the transforms are completely unknown ) , and using the facts that @xmath111 and @xmath112 , this can be seen to be less than or equal to the success probability of the singlet strategy .",
    "the difference in comparison with the singlet strategy is a manifestation of gain due to entanglement .",
    "the overall averaged success probability for one run of the non - entangled two - photon strategy is 1/4 .",
    "this may be realised by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : pdiffnonent ] ) directly , or by noting that detecting @xmath107 and @xmath108 as different corresponds to finding them in an antisymmetric state , in other words , in @xmath113 , which is one of four orthogonal basis states .",
    "an advantage of the single photon and non - entangled strategies is that they are easily generalised to comparison of many transforms and transforms of higher dimension , as will be seen below .",
    "it is straightforward to generalise the single photon comparison strategy to the case when @xmath114 @xmath12 unitary transformations are to be compared .",

    "this test state may be obtained using a non - polarising beam splitter , which is a linear device splitting an incident particle into @xmath114 different paths with equal probability @xmath121 each , independent of the polarisation @xcite .",

    "a non - entangled strategy based on state comparison succeeds with a probability 1-@xmath163 , where @xmath141 is the dimension of the totally symmetric subspace .",
    "if the number of transforms to be compared is not equal to their dimensionality , then we still have to look for the lowest dimensional invariant subspaces .",
    "we may choose a test state lying in the lowest dimensional invariant subspace available , apply the transforms to be compared , and then check whether the output state remains in the same subspace or not .",
    "strictly speaking the subspace does not even have to be invariant , it will suffice if we are able to unambiguously predict in which subspace @xmath0 the output state will lie if the transforms are identical .",
    "an output state in the space complementary to @xmath0 will then indicate a difference in the transforms .",
    "the comparison of two two - qubit transformations , for instance , would require us to work with the following four - particle states : @xmath164 these states span the non - totally symmetric subspace ( @xmath144 and @xmath145 are the qubit basis states ) .",
    "its complementary subspace is the symmetric subspace , which is ten - dimensional .",
    "a test state lying either in the subspace spanned by the states ( [ eq : nonsym ] ) or in the totally symmetric subspace will remain in the same subspace whenever the two transforms are identical .",
    "a detection of the output state in the complementary subspace therefore unambiguously implies that the transforms were different .",
    "starting in the lower dimensional non - totally symmetric subspace , however , will yield a higher comparison success probability , @xmath165 , as opposed to @xmath166 when starting in the ten - dimensional symmetric subspace .",
    "the non - entangled strategy based on state comparison makes use of the totally symmetric subspace as a starting space .",
    "we may use it for comparing any number of unitary transforms of any dimension , by acting with the transforms to be compared upon copies of a test state , and then comparing all the test states .",
    "although an entangled strategy may perform better , because it can use an invariant subspace with a lower dimension , a non - entangled strategy may be easier to implement experimentally .",
    "the single particle strategy is clearly the easiest to realise .",
    "its success probability also scales favorably as @xmath159 with the number of transforms .",
    "if we have additional information about the transforms , then we may use this knowledge in selecting the test state and the way in which to use the ( single ) copies of the transforms available , and in how to detect differences and similarities from the output state .",
    "this is possible whatever strategy chosen , using a single particle or a many particle test state , for unambiguous and minimum - error strategies , or for any other type of comparison strategy .",
    "the same freedom to select for example entangled test states applies .    it will always be possible to use the universal comparison strategies considered above , but it may be possible to improve on the success probability @xmath36 , and also to obtain an unambiguous answer that the transformations are identical",
    "this is the case if the two transforms are known to be members of a given set , e.g. @xmath167 .",
    "there are then four possibilities for the output state , depending on whether @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , or @xmath171 , and we have to distinguish the two former ones from the two latter ones . in other words , we have to distinguish the subspace spanned by the two output states when @xmath20 from the subspace spanned by the output states when @xmath172 . in general , these two subspaces are nonorthogonal , and can not be perfectly discriminated .",
    "but in analogy with state discrimination , it will be possible to unambiguously distinguish these two possibilities , allowing for inconclusive results",
    ". it will be possible to obtain an unambiguous answer not only that @xmath10 and @xmath11 are different , but also that they are identical . we could also choose to make a minimum - error measurement .    if we are given the information that @xmath10 and @xmath11 are both controlled - not gates , but not in which basis , then , if they have the same basis , @xmath173 will be the identity operator .",
    "this implies that if @xmath173 applied to a state changes the state , the bases of the two controlled - not gates @xmath10 and @xmath11 must have been different , and this can be used for comparison .",
    "this same argument may be useful when any cyclic transformations are to be compared .",
    "in this paper we have considered the situation where one is interested in whether two or more unitary transforms are the same or different . no knowledge about the individual transforms",
    "is desired , only whether there is a difference or not .",
    "it is indeed possible to _ compare _ the transforms without first estimating them . a `` trial '' copy of a transform",
    "may also be compared to a master copy .",
    "this can be used to test for defects in the `` trial '' copy , and may , in this sense , be used as a way of transformation estimation .",
    "we have considered unambiguous comparison strategies , which allows us to make confident statements about the transforms . when the transforms are completely unknown , it is not possible to obtain an unambiguous result that the transforms are identical , but it is possible to detect them as different .    we have treated the case of comparing two @xmath12 unitary transforms in depth , and made some generalisations .",
    "three types of unambiguous comparison strategies were derived : a single particle strategy , a singlet strategy employing the concept of invariant subspaces , and a non - entangled two particle strategy .",
    "success probabilities are calculated for these strategies .",
    "obvious extensions to the present work include a deeper treatment of transformation comparison when there is knowledge about the transforms .",
    "the conceptual connection to state comparison is obvious @xcite .",
    "one may also draw an analogy to the deutsch - jozsa algorithm for determining whether a function is balanced or constant with a single application of the function @xcite . here , the function values are not interesting , only whether the function is balanced or equal .",
    "similarly , we have devised strategies for determining whether unitary transforms are different or not , without obtaining information about what the transforms actually are .",
    "the feature that collective information may be obtained without knowledge of the parts of a system is characteristic of many quantum algorithms vs. their classical counterparts .",
    "it is connected to the possibility of choosing the measurement basis for a quantum system more freely than for a classical system .",
