    "the discovery and confirmation of terrestrial bodies orbiting other stars ( e.g. @xcite ) has generated enormous public as well as scientific interest .",
    "it has shown that after a mere two decades of exoplanetary research finding potentially habitable worlds around other stars seems to be almost within our grasp .",
    "close - by stars and stellar systems are thereby premium targets , as they tend to offer reasonable signal to noise ratios ( snrs ) for photometry and radial velocity as well as comparatively large astrometric amplitudes @xcite . as more than half of the stars in the solar neighborhood are members of binary or multiple systems @xcite , it is not surprising that more than 70 planets in or around binary - stars have been discovered @xcite despite the current observational focus on single star systems . even - though nasa s _ kepler _ mission has been quite successful in finding circumbinary planets ( e.g. @xcite ) we will focus on binary - star systems with potential _",
    "habitable zones ( hzs ) in this study .",
    "in fact , most of the planets discovered in double stars are in these so - called s - type configurations @xcite , where the planet orbits one star only .",
    "the telluric companion of @xmath0 cen b is such an example @xcite .",
    "an interesting question in this regard is doubtlessly : can s - type binary stars harbor habitable worlds ?",
    "already @xcite and @xcite and more recently @xcite investigated the effects such configurations have on the insolation hypothetical planets would receive .",
    "@xcite ( in the following referred to as eg12 ) were able to derive analytic expressions to find hzs in binary star systems unifying dynamical and radiative balance models for s - type binary star - planet systems .",
    "while the exact manner in which planets form in tight binary star systems is still hotly debated in astrophysical literature - see for instance @xcite and references therein , the discovery of has made the existence of terrestrial planets in s - type binary star systems an observational fact .",
    "opinions still differ on whether it is theoretically possible that planets in @xmath0 centauri s hzs can form on stable orbits . even though classical n - body simulations with best case accretion scenarios seem to be able to produce terrestrial planets near the hzs of the @xmath0 centauri system @xcite",
    ", @xcite concluded that even when gas drag is included the encounter velocities between kilometer sized planetesimals would lead to erosive collisions , thus making constant accretion unlikely .",
    "however , in their model they did not include a self - consistent evolution of the gas disc , nor did they consider planetesimal self gravitation or re - accretion of collisional debris .",
    "@xcite used a self consistent disc model with planetesimals .",
    "they were able produced accretion friendly scenarios when the collision frequency was sufficiently high to prevent orbital dephasing .",
    "other possible solutions to the problem of high encounter velocities range from including planetesimal and embryo migration @xcite over mild inclination of planetesimal discs with respect to the binary s orbit @xcite to more realistic radiative modeling of the system s gaseous disc @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that even if additional earth - like planets in @xmath0 centauri do exist , it is not an easy task to find them given current observational limitations in radial velocity resolution .",
    "the rv signal semi amplitude of @xmath0 cen b b was near the current edge of feasibility with , whereas accuracies lower than @xmath2 cm / s would be necessary to discover telluric planets in @xmath0 cen b s hzs .",
    "astrometry is not much more helpful in this case , as the necessary astrometric amplitudes to detect habitable worlds in @xmath0 centauri will only be available near the end of the gaia mission s lifetime @xcite .    in this study",
    "we tackle the question whether there are s - type systems in the solar neighborhood that might make for easier targets . for this purpose",
    "we select 19 s - type binary systems from `` the washington visual double star catalog '' ( wdc ) @xcite with well determined stellar parameters that lie within a distance of 31 pc from the solar system , and calculate hzs for each stellar component using the analytic method presented in @xcite .",
    "we provide estimates on the rv and astrometric ( am ) root mean square ( rms ) signal strengths expected for an earth - like planet orbiting at the borders of a system s hzs .",
    "furthermore , we present likely transit depths for potentially transiting habitable planets in co - planar s - type double star systems .    this article is structured as follows : first , we will discuss the selection criteria for the 19 systems investigated ( section [ sec : sel ] ) . after a brief summary of the main factors that determine habitability for terrestrial planets in binary star systems ( section [",
    "sec : hz ] ) , the issue of dynamical stability of planets in such configurations is addressed in section [ sec : stab ] .",
    "our results - tables with hz borders and signal strength estimates - are presented and discussed in sections [ sec : res ] and [ sec : trans ] .",
    "current problems in modeling tidal locking of planets in binary systems are mentioned in section [ sec : tides ] .",
    "a summary ( section [ sec : sum ] ) concludes this study .",
    "we preselected all detached binaries with semimajor axes @xmath3 au using the stellar orbital parameters provided in the wdc , in order to find suitable s - type systems in the solar neighborhood where earth - like planets in hzs could be detectable . hereby , we only considered systems within a distance of @xmath1 pc from our solar system as determined by the hipparchos mission @xcite . together with the prerequisite that the binaries orbital elements had to be available",
    ", the afore mentioned restrictions reduced the number of admissible double star systems to 313 .",
    "furthermore , only double star configurations with known spectal types of both components were used .",
    "peculiar spectra that might have been classified incorrectly by hipparchos like hip 17544 & 73695 were also excluded , narrowing the set of candidate systems from 313 to 35 .",
    "the ultimate selection criterion consisted of calculating the binaries periods using bolometric luminosity derived masses together with the semimajor axes given in wds and comparing them to the observed binary periods . the stellar bolometric luminosities and masses required for this purpose were derived as follows : with the distances available through hipparchos data the systems absolute visual magnitudes could be calculated . in order to assess the bolometric luminosities of the binary sample , we performed bolometric corrections ( bc ) of the absolute visual magnitudes using the polynomial fits by @xcite .",
    "the required effective temperatures were estimated via spectral type and luminosity using the catalog of stellar model atmospheres @xcite .",
    "we then calculated the binaries periods using the masses derived via the mass - luminosity relations given in @xcite . only those systems who s derived periods",
    "did not deviate more than 11% from the observed periods were selected for the final sample .",
    "stellar and orbital parameters for the final set of 19 s - type binary systems are presented in table [ tab1 ] .    in the next section",
    "we will briefly discuss the main points on how to determine hzs for these s - type binary systems .",
