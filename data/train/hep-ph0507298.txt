    "in elementary particle physics , susy @xcite was proposed for stabilizing the electroweak ( ew ) energy scale @xcite which is otherwise unnaturally small compared to the grand unification scale @xmath12 gev @xcite .",
    "the study of the cosmological constant @xcite , however , suggests that unnaturalness of @xmath13 fine tuning might be just so from the anthropic point of view .",
    "it was argued that the string theory even supports the emergence of the anthropic landscape @xcite .",
    "this led to a consideration of giving up naturalness of the ew scale @xcite . to keep gauge coupling constant unification and the dark matter ,",
    "the so - called split susy @xcite was invented which has new features phenomenologically @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was asked that if susy is not for stabilizing the ew scale , what else job does this beautifully mathematical physics do in particle physics , other than gauge coupling unification and the dark matter ?",
    "we proposed to make use of susy to understand the lepton mass hierarchies .",
    "the flavor puzzle , namely the fermion masses , mixing and cp violation , in the standard model ( sm ) needs new physics to be understood @xcite .",
    "the empirical fermion mass pattern is that the third generation is much heavier than the second generation which is also much heavier than the first .",
    "this may imply a family symmetry @xcite .",
    "we first considered the charged leptons . by assuming a @xmath14 cyclic symmetry among the @xmath1 doublets @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) of the three generations @xcite , only the tau lepton gets mass , the muon and electron are still massless .",
    "the essential point is how the family symmetry breaks .",
    "naively the symmetry breaking can be achieved by introducing family - dependent higgs fields .",
    "we observed that susy naturally provides such higgs - like fields , which are the scalar neutrinos .",
    "if the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the sneutrinos are non - vanishing , @xmath17 , the r - parity violating interactions @xmath18 @xcite , with @xmath19 denoting the anti - particle superfields of the su(2 ) singlet leptons , contribute to the fermion masses , in addition to the yukawa interactions .",
    "this is the origin of family symmetry breaking .",
    "the above idea has been proposed for some time @xcite . because susy had been used to stabilize the ew scale , that idea suffered from severe constraints .",
    "for example , the @xmath5-neutrino should be @xmath20 mev heavy @xcite .",
    "it is a liberation if susy has nothing to do with the ew scale . because the susy breaking scale",
    "is very high , the neutrinos are light . furthermore , there is no need to introduce the r - parity or the baryon number as a symmetry .    in this paper , after refining the lepton sector , we include discussion of the quark masses . to understand the large ratio of the top quark mass and the bottom quark mass , we assume that @xmath21 is large . numerically we make modification correspondingly .",
    "while the @xmath5-lepton mass is from the down - type higgs vev @xmath22 gev , the muon mass is due to @xmath23 , @xmath24 with @xmath25 standing for the trilinear r - parity violation couplings .",
    "it is natural @xmath26 like the yukawa couplings for the @xmath5 mass .",
    "the muon mass tells us then @xmath27 gev .",
    "@xmath28 gev @xmath23 s could induce a large lepton number violating effect , namely a large neutrino majorana mass if the neutralinos are not heavy , due to @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the @xmath31 gauge coupling constant , and @xmath32 is the gaugino mass .",
    "when we take @xmath33 gev , the above formula can produce a neutrino mass needed to explain the solar neutrino problem .    this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii , we will review , improve and expand the discussion of the lepton sector @xcite .",

    "unnaturalness is understood by the anthropic principle .",
    "one meaningful question is then that why are not the sm yukawa couplings anthropically determined ?",
    "we answer this question from the following aspects .",
    "one is that although the electron mass might be understood from the anthropic point of view , it is hard to say all the yukawa couplings including the neutrino masses being anthropically determined . theoretically we have given up naturalness in the thooft sense .",
    "rather , dirac naturalness has been emphasized in considering the fermion mass hierarchies .",
    "whether such an effort can be justified should be studied in the more fundamental theory .",
    "finally we make a remark on the possibility of lowering the susy breaking scale from @xmath309 gev to @xmath28 tev .",
    "this work essentially has made use of susy to understand fermion masses .",
    "the susy breaking scale is fixed by the neutrino masses implied by the neutrino oscillations .",
    "it would be much more interesting if susy also plays the role of stabilizing the ew scale @xcite .",
    "we note that it is still possible that the @xmath5-neutrino mass is about @xmath20 mev @xcite ( in this case the atmospheric neutrino problem is due to @xmath310 oscillation which is also yet ruled out experimentally ) , then the susy breaking scale will be about a few tev .",
    "in that case the ew energy scale will be marginally natural .",
    "if susy is not for stabilizing the ew energy scale , what is it used for in particle physics ? in this paper , motivated by our previous works @xcite , we have proposed that susy is for flavor problems . a family symmetry @xmath0 , which is the cyclic symmetry among the three generation @xmath31 doublets , is introduced .",

    "this family symmetry is broken by soft susy breaking terms .",
    "these terms contribute masses via loops to the second generation quarks and the electron .",

    "<S> it turns out that for the charged leptons , the @xmath5 mass is from the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) and the sneutrino vevs , the muon mass is due to the sneutrino vevs , and the electron gains its mass due to both @xmath0 and susy breaking . </S>",
