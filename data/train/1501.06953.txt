    "[ introduction ] the first generation of stars so - called , population  iii ( pop  iii ) stars were predicted to form about several hundred million years after the big bang [ ] .",
    "the pop  iii stars were born in the gravitational - potential wells constructed by the dark matter halos of masses about @xmath4 solar masses ( @xmath0 ) , that allowed the primordial gas ( mass content : 76 % hydrogen , 24% helium ) to form stars . because no heavy elements ( metals ) were present at that time , molecular hydrogen served as the most efficient coolant , but it could not cool the gas temperature efficiently .",
    "thus , the jeans mass of the pop  iii star - forming cloud was expected to be much larger than the one of the current star formation regions ; consequently the pop  iii stars could be more massive than the present - day stars .",
    "modern cosmology simulations suggested that the mass scale of the pop  iii stars would fall between tens to hundreds of @xmath0 .",
    "the exact mass scale is still under debate . without initial metals such as carbon and oxygen , the pop  iii stars needed to reach higher core temperatures to burn hydrogen effectively [ ] , that also resulted in higher surface temperatures .",
    "so these stars could produce large amounts of uv photons and extensively ionized primordial hydrogen , and helium inside the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) leading to the cosmic reionization [ ] .",
    "after their short life time of several million years , many massive pop  iii stars might have died as supernovae and dispersed the first metal to the primordial igm .",
    "such chemical enrichment might have changed the later star formation mode from pop  iii to pop  ii and profoundly reshaped the simple early universe into a state of ever - increasing complexity .",
    "thus , understanding the first stars and their supernovae has become one of the frontiers of modern cosmology .",
    "fate of a massive star strongly correlate to its final mass before its death . because there is no initial metal inside the envelope of pop  iii stars , the mass loss rates due to the metal line - driven wind can be strongly suppressed .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to assume that pop  iii stars losses very little or no mass during their stellar evolution . based on stellar physics [ ] ,",
    "the pop  iii stars with initial masses of @xmath5 eventually forge an iron core about one solar mass .",
    "when the iron core mass exceeds its chandrasekhar mass [ ] , the degenerate pressure of electrons is no longer able to support its own gravity .",
    "the iron core catastrophically collapses into a black hole or neutron star .",
    "the energy released from the gravity allows an energetic explosion so - called a core - collapse supernova",
    ". however , such explosions may fail and the entire star may collapses directly into a black hole .",
    "the nature of core - collapse supernovae is complicated by several hurdles such as neutrino physics , multi - scale , and multi - dimension [ ] .",
    "the explosion mechanisms remain subject to investigation . if pop  iii stars are more massive than @xmath6 . after the central carbon burning , their cores encounter the electron / positron production instability",
    ", the core reaches sufficiently high temperatures ( @xmath7 ) and low densities ( @xmath8 ) to favor the creation of electron - positron pairs .",
    "it reduces the adiabatic index @xmath9 below 4/3 and causes a dynamical instability of the core .",
    "the core is now at quasi hydrodynamical equilibrium and its temperatures begin to oscillate for a period of its dynamic time scale of several hundred seconds .",
    "the variations in temperature do not cause a significant impact to its evolution and the star later dies as a core - collapse supernova . however , if the stars are more than 100 @xmath0 , the oscillation of temperatures becomes very violent .",
    "several large temperature spikes produce shocks with energy of @xmath10 .",
    "these shocks can not disperse the entire star , but eject its outer envelopes instead .",
    "due to different amount of mass and energetics , these ejected shells are likely to run into each other .",
    "the colliding shells effectively convert the kinetic energy of ejecta into the internal energy of gas .",
    "the collision sites usually happen at optically thin regions and thermal radiation escape immediately and produce very luminous optical transits known as pulsational pair - instability supernovae [ ] .",
    "once the mass of stars reaches between 150 and 260 @xmath0 . at this point ,",
    "pair - instabilities become so violent and trigger a runaway collapse of core .",
    "the core temperature and density rise swiftly and ignite the explosive oxygen / silicon burning .",
    "the energy released from the burning converts the contraction of the core into an energetic explosion that completely disrupts the entire star .",
    "this thermonuclear explosion , known as a pair - instability supernova ( psn ) , that has explosion energies up to @xmath11 and yield up to 50 @xmath12 of @xmath2 [ ] .",
    "most of stars are 300 @xmath0are believed to simply die as a black hole .",
    "a new type of supernova caused by the general - relativity instability in supermassive stars at @xmath13 @xmath0 , which may have formed in the early universe , has now also been found [ ] .    because the pop  iii stars were predicted to very massive",
    ", many of them tended to die as psne .",
    "the 1d psn models have been extensively studied by several authors [ ] .",
    "the extensive yields , explosion energies , and radiation properties of psne are calculated in their models . unlike core - collapse supernovae ,",
    "the thermonuclear explosions of psne are not very sensitive to the dimensionality of simulations . however , simulating the mixing of the fluid instabilities in psne still requires multidimensional simulations that recently become accessible and studied by [ ] .",
    "the simulations of [ ] found the mixing of psn from the both burning and hydrodynamics instabilities .",
    "in the red super - giant progenitors , the mixing driven by the rayleigh - taylor instabilities can be very significant .",
    "one of the important physical quantities in the stellar evolution is rotation . in the real world , the process of star formation usually endows a certain amount of angular momentum to the star and makes it rotate . due to the technical difficulty of the study",
    ", the rotational rates of massive stars are still poorly understood in both theoretical and observational studies .",
    "rotation can affect the stellar evolution as well as the resulting supernova explosions .",
    "the nucleosynthesis inside the stars changes due to the rotational mixing , so that the chemical composition of the star changes .",
    "if metal from the inner part is mixed out to the envelope , the stellar wind can be enhanced due to metal - driven lines .",
    "strong winds reduce the stellar mass dramatically and affect the fate of the stars .",
    "studies of the stellar evolution of very massive stars with rotation have been performed by [ ] .",
    "recent results from [ ] show that rotation can lower the mass criterion for psne progenitors because mixing facilitates helium burning , resulting in a more massive oxygen core .",
    "recent simulations [ ] suggested that the pop  iii stars could rotate very fast , up to @xmath14 of keplerian rate at the surface .",
    "if such a high rotation does exist , it can affect the evolution of the stars and their supernovae .",
    "so we perform 2d simulations of psne with rotation and investigate how the strong rotation impacts the explosive burning .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the energetics and nucleosynthesis of psne during the explosion phase .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : we first describe the numerical approaches and setup of our simulations in   [ rot_methodology ] .",
    "then we present the results in   [ rot_results ] and",
    "conclude our findings in ",
    "[ rot_discussion ] .",
    "[ rot_methodology ] the 3d stellar evolution models followed from the main sequence star to supernovae are still unavailable due to the limitations of current computational power . alternatively , we start simulating the stars with ` kepler ` [ ] , a 1d spherically - symmetric lagrangian code , and follow the evolution of stars up to @xmath15 seconds before the supernova explosions .",
    "then we map the resulting 1d stellar evolution models from ` kepler ` onto 2d grids of ` castro ` as the initial conditions .",
    "we then apply our differential rotation scheme to ` castro ` and follow the simulations until the explosive burning ceases when the shock has successfully launched .",
    "this setup is designed to model the most critical phases of the supernova explosion in 2d with practical computational resources . in this section",
    ", we introduce our progenitor models , problem setup , and numerical methods .",
    "we use progenitor pop  iii stars of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 with very little overshooting at the late - time evolution .",
    "these stars eventually become blue supergiants which have smaller radii than those of red supergiants .",
    "the 1d stellar models are evolved until most of the explosive burning is about to happen .",
    "physical properties of these stars are listed in table 1 .",
    "the resulting 1d profiles are then mapped onto 2d cylindrical grids of ` castro ` using a new mapping algorithm [ ] .",
    "this initialization scheme conservatively maps the physical quantities such as mass and energy during mapping from 1d to multi - d .",
    "the initial perturbations are seeded in the form of velocities based on the stellar convection physics .",
    "@xmath19 : initial stellar mass ; @xmath20 : helium core mass at collapse ; @xmath21 : central density at collapse ; @xmath22 : central temperature at collapse ; and @xmath23 : stellar radius .",
    "we run 2d simulations using ` castro ` [ ] , a massively parallel , multidimensional eulerian , adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) , hydrodynamics code for astrophysical applications . `",
    "castro ` was originally developed at the lawrence berkeley lab , and it is designed to run effectively on supercomputers over 10,000 cpus . `",
    "castro ` provides a powerful platform for simulating hydrodynamics and gravity for astrophysical gas dynamics .",
    "modeling thermonuclear supernovae requires calculating the energy generation rates from nuclear burning , which occurs over an extensive range of temperatures , densities , and compositions of isotopes .",
    "we have implemented the approx 19-isotope reaction network [ ] into ` castro ` .",
    "it is capable of efficiently calculating accurate energy generation rates for major nuclear reactions from hydrogen to silicon burning . in `",
    "castro ` , we use a realistic equation of state ( eos ) [ ] for stellar matter .",
    "this eos considers the ( non)degenerate and ( non)relativistic electrons , electron - positron pair production , as well as ideal gas with radiation . it is a tabular eos that reads in @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 of gas and yields its derivative thermodynamics quantities . `",
    "castro ` offers different types of calculation for gravity , including constant , poisson , and monopole . for supernova simulations , spherical symmetry",
    "is still a good approximation for the mass distribution of gas at the early phase of evolution .",
    "using this approximation saves lot of computational time in the gravity solver . for 2d or 3d",
    "` castro ` simulations , we first calculate a 1d radial average profile of density , then compute the 1d profile of @xmath27 field and use it to calculate the gravity of the multidimensional grid cells .",
    "care is taken to resolve the important scales of the explosions such as catching the shock front and mixing driven by fluid instabilities .",
    "the grid structure for 2d simulations uses base grids , @xmath28 with additional three levels of amr to resolve a domain of @xmath29 .",
    "this setup yields the size of the finest patch about @xmath30 which fully resolves the nuclear burning and the structures of fluid instabilities of rotating psne .",
    "the amr criteria are set for gradients of density , velocity , and pressure .",
    "finer zones are automatically created on the top of over - gradient regions .",
    "2d ` castro ` uses a cylindrical coordinate @xmath31 . the axis @xmath32 serves as the rotational axis .",
    "since we simulate only half of the star in 2d . the lower boundary of @xmath33 uses reflect conditions to prohibit fluid from entering ; the other three boundaries use outflow conditions that allow the fluid to freely cross over .",
    "we also constructed nested zones to ensure that the inner region of the star constantly receives a higher spatial resolution .",
    "we develop a differential rotational model motivated by the stellar structure .",
    "it yields non - uniform rotational rates inside different regions of stars . because the oxygen core of the star is a dense and compact object , we assume it behaves like a rigid body with a constant rotational rate , @xmath34 . outside the oxygen core",
    ", the structure of the helium and hydrogen envelope is relatively puffy and unlikely to keep the constant @xmath34 .",
    "instead , we assume a constant specific angular moment extending from the edge of oxygen core to its surface and @xmath34 monotonically decreases from the rotational axis , as shown in figure  [ rot_model ] . to determine the radius of oxygen core and its rotational rate , we plot the oxygen abundance as a function of radius in figure  [ osize ] .",
    "the most abundant oxygen is located at the radius between @xmath35 , and its outer boundaries of the oxygen core is at @xmath36 .",
    "based on the size and mass of the oxygen core , we determine its keplerian rotational rates , @xmath37 which is about @xmath38 . to examine whether the model is viable , we calculate @xmath37 as a function of radius in figure  [ somega ] .",
    "it shows a nice trend of constant @xmath34 in the the oxygen core and slowly decrease from the core boundary .",
    "our assumption of oxygen rotating as a rigid body seems to be very suitable for the model .",
    "is the rotational rate and @xmath33 is the distance to the rotational axis .",
    "@xmath34 inside the oxygen core ( @xmath39 ) is assumed as a constant . beyond the core ( @xmath40 ) , we assume a specific angular @xmath41 constant and result in @xmath42 .",
    "[ rot_model ] ]    we therefore assume a constant rotational rate inside the oxygen core and this rate is based on the keplerian rate of the oxygen core . in ` castro ` , the rotation is calculated by the angular momentum , @xmath41 which provides a force term in the euler equation for fluids and itself is evolved by advect equations : @xmath43 here @xmath44 are the density , pressure , velocity vector , and gravitational vector , respectively .",
    "@xmath45 is the centrifugal force calculated by @xmath24 , the angular momentum per unit mass @xmath41 , and the distance to the rotational axis @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath41 is only initialized at the beginning of the simulations , then it evolves with fluid elements following the equations as above .",
    "[ rot_results ] we first present the results from the representative model of the @xmath17 rotating pop  iii star with @xmath47 .",
    "after the onset of the 2d ` castro ` simulation , the core of the star starts to collapse due to its dynamical instabilities caused by pair - production instabilities .",
    "similar to the case of non - rotating stars , explosive oxygen and silicon burning proceed as the core contracts .",
    "after about @xmath48 seconds , the energy released from the nuclear burning launches a shock and the core of star has successfully exploded . for a non - rotating case , collapse of the core is perfectly anisotropic and homogeneous .",
    "thus , the resulting explosion appears to have spherical symmetry .",
    "however , for a rotating star , rotation provides a centrifugal force to resist the in - falling gas during the collapse . because the centrifugal force follows as @xmath49",
    ", for the given distance from the center of star , the core receives the strongest @xmath45 along the equatorial direction and no force in the polar direction .",
    "it automatically leads to anisotropic compression of the core and reflects in the explosion .",
    "the maximum compression happens along the polar direction and yields more explosion energy and releases a more powerful shock wave than other directions .",
    "the core is blew up in an elliptical shape with a long axis along the rotational axis .",
    "figure  [ rot_2d_a ] shows the post - explosion of @xmath17 progenitor star , @xmath50 in the left - half panel and @xmath47 in the right - half panel .",
    "both snapshots are taken at the same time after the explosions occur . in comparison of both results ,",
    "the non - rotating model shows a stronger shock wave , and demonstrates some mixing at the inner part of the oxygen - burning shells .",
    "the rotating model , however , shows a relatively less energetic explosion due to a weaker compression ; the ejected oxygen - burning shell is shaped into an ellipse and shows very little mixing .",
    "psne of non - rotating stars usually produce a large amount of radioactive isotope , @xmath2  which is made inside psne mainly by the explosive @xmath51 burning right before the core bounces .",
    "because the decay energy from @xmath2 powers the psn light curves , it becomes one of the key isotopes for observations .",
    "the amount of @xmath2 production can determine whether the psne become bright or faint sne .",
    "we show the corresponding @xmath2 abundance and gas density in figure  [ rot_2d_b ] .",
    "the non - rotating star demonstrate a visual @xmath2  abundance , which is missing in the rotating model .",
    "it suggests that @xmath2 production has been significantly suppressed due to rotation . only about @xmath52 @xmath2",
    "is made in the rotational model .",
    "however , the non - rotating model has synthesized about @xmath53 of @xmath2 .",
    "this suggests that a strong rotation can significantly affect the energetic and @xmath2 production in psne .",
    "pop  iii star .",
    "the left - half sphere is the non - rotating model , and the right - half is the rotating model of @xmath54 .",
    "the gray colors show the radial velocities @xmath55 , and the colorful contours are the @xmath56 mass fraction .",

    "both snapshots are taken at the same time , about @xmath57 after the onset of the explosion .",
    "[ rot_2d_b ] ]    .",
    "strong fluid instabilities occur during the explosion along the equatorial plane shown in the red box of the left panel ; its close - up appears in the right panel .",
    "[ overshooting ] ]    what happens if @xmath59 ?",
    "this is an extreme rotational rate which can almost break out of the star s core . to answer this question",
    ", we simulate a @xmath17 of @xmath59 .",
    "the anisotropic compression becomes even more stronger than that of the @xmath47 case .",
    "the ellipse shape of the ejected core has an larger eccentricity .",
    "one interesting fluid instability has been found in the carbon - burning shell , which is shown in figure  [ overshooting ] . the carbon shell breaks along the equatorial plane and overshoots some carbon into the oxygen core .",
    "this overshooting develops strong fluid instabilities . because the explosion is anisotropic , the shocks of different directions are initialized at different times : the pole comes first , and the equator comes last .",
    "in this fast - rotating model , the shock from the pole has been sent out , but the gas along the equator is still collapsing .",
    "once the shock runs into the collapsing gas , the richtmyer@xmath60meshkov ( rm ) instability [ ] starts to develop and the resulting mixing makes carbon penetrate into the oxygen - rich envelope .",
    "[ rot_discussion ] stellar rotation plays a key role in both stellar evolution and the fate of the very massive pop  iii stars .",
    "the nature of the rotation can be traced back to the phase of star formation , when they are endowed with angular momentum .",
    "the definite rotational rates for the massive pop  iii stars are still unknown . results of these star formation suggest that a high rotational rate is @xmath1 of its keplerian rotational rate .",
    "we present the results of the impact of rotation on a @xmath17 star .",
    "the @xmath1 keplerian rotational rate case demonstrates the onset of an anisotropic explosion and strongly suppresses @xmath2 .",
    "if this does apply for psn progenitors , @xmath2 production shown in previous psn models may change and the corresponding psne luminosity will be attenuated .",
    "an extreme case of a @xmath3 keplerian rate shows an interesting feature of overshooting along the equatorial plane caused by non - synchronized explosions that send shocks into the infilling gas .",
    "finally , we conclude that psne of fast rotating stars would look much fainter than we originally expect because of the limited @xmath2  production .",
