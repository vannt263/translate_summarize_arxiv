    "studies of the chemical composition of galaxy disks typically assume that the orbital radii of stars are essentially static .",
    "only a small diffusion in radial distance , increasing with age , is expected due to dynamical heating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the metallicity of stars of similar age and galactic distance should be comparable , as they are born from the remnants of previous stellar generations that orbited at the same radius .",
    "however , observations of local f and g dwarfs have found little evidence for such coexistent evolution , instead revealing a large scatter in the age  metallicity distribution @xcite .",
    "theoretical work has suggested that this scatter may be due to resonant interactions between stars and spiral arms , which enable stars to migrate across many kpc @xcite .",
    "indeed , using a high - resolution hydrodynamical simulation , @xcite found that such migration naturally led to the high degree of variation observed in the age ",
    "metallicity relation of local milky way ( mw ) stars .",
    "these events , in which the guiding center of the star shifts , differ from general diffusion where the epicyclic motion increases by only a few kpc due to an increase in velocity dispersion .",
    "testing such models of stellar migration may be possible using studies of stellar populations beyond the classical disk break of late - type galaxies .",
    "the cause of this break is still debated ( see the review by * ? ? ?",

    "using a study of 85 late - type galaxies , @xcite found that the surface brightness profile of approximately 60% of disk galaxies steepens beyond the disk break .",
    "hence , the outskirts of disk galaxies are often associated with a dearth of star formation . using _",
    "n_-body simulations of disk galaxy formation , @xcite found that if star formation is sufficiently suppressed beyond the break , then that region may form almost entirely from stars migrated from the inner disk .",
    "this would leave a clear signal on radial surface brightness profiles , with older stars ( i.e. , those that have been subject to scattering for longer ) exhibiting shallower profiles .",

    "ghosts observations of 4244 revealed the location of the disk break to be independent of stellar age , thus constraining several mechanisms for the formation of this feature @xcite .",
    "however , lack of data beyond the break prevented further analysis . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the spiral galaxy 7793 .",
    "this flocculent galaxy is ( 1 ) relatively nearby ( 3.70.1mpc , r - s11 ) , ( 2 ) situated at high galactic latitude ( 77.2 ) and hence relatively uncontaminated by foreground stars , and ( 3 ) an isolated loosely bound member of the sculptor group .",
    "7793 was recently studied by @xcite , who found no sign of a break in the red giant branch ( rgb ) population , but did find evidence for an upturn in the radial metallicity distribution beyond the disk break . in this paper , we expand on this work by using data from the ghosts survey together with a new @xmath0 wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) image of the inner disk to measure fainter stars and to recover stellar densities in this crowded region .",
    "we compare these observations with predictions from the radial migration simulations of @xcite and discuss alternate explanations .",
    "figure  [ fig : cmds ] plots the location of the two ghosts fields discussed in this paper ( fields 2 and 3 ) .",
    "each field was observed with dithered 740s exposures in both the f606w and f814w filters .",
    "r - s11 described the data reduction and photometry of the resolved stars in these fields using the  code @xcite . a further field ( field 1 )",
    "was observed with the wfc3 camera to characterize the disk truncation ( _ hst _ go program 12196 ) .",
    "this observation was made using the same filters as the acs fields , with dithered exposures of 980s in f606w and 1488s in f814w .",
    "we use the same  parameters and the same crowded - field stellar selection criteria for the wfc3 field as used by r - s11 for the acs photometry . despite minor differences between the cameras , namely , pixel scale and quantum efficiency in the f814w filter , we found little discrepancy in the resulting photometry between the cameras in overlapping regions .",
    "the resulting color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for each of the fields are presented in figure  [ fig : cmds ] . by analyzing synthetic cmds generated with a constant sfr of 0.01@xmath2 yr@xmath3 , an appropriate metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath4 , and photometric errors matching the observations",
    ", we identified three regions of the cmd corresponding to three discrete age ranges .",
    "the area marked as `` young '' consists of bright main sequence and helium - burning ( heb ) stars , which are collectively 10100myr old ; the `` intermediate '' region is composed of @xmath51gyr old heb stars ; and the `` old '' region consists of @xmath6gyr old rgb stars .",
    "we subsequently use these regions , which suffer little cross contamination , to select stellar populations by age .",
    "r - s11 generated artificial stars for the acs fields , which were subsequently used to assess errors and correct for completeness due to stellar crowding .",
    "we generated an additional 1.8 million artificial stars for the wfc3 image .",
    "figure  [ fig : cmds ] plots the 50% recovery limit of these artificial stars , which we set as our limiting magnitude .",
    "we found good agreement between detection rates and photometry in the overlapping region of fields 1 and 2 .",
    "the wfc3 observation from field 1 yielded 3474 detections brighter than f814w = 25.75mag after culling , while acs ( field 2 ) found 3631 , despite the shorter exposure time .",
    "approximately 82% of the acs detections were coincident between fields .",
    "after correcting for completeness with the artificial star tests , this increased to 95% .",
    "the remainder can be attributed to incompleteness at the magnitude limit of the survey .",
    "the median photometric differences between coincident detections are and 0.03mag in f606w and f814w , respectively .",
    "the mean error of these detections , when combined in quadrature , is @xmath70.10 in both filters .",
    "hence , although the offsets are systematic , they are significantly less than the  uncertainties .",
    "we thus found our photometry from the two different cameras to be consistent and complete to @xmath8mag .",
    "in the left panel of figure  [ fig : radial ] , we plot the radial star counts of 7793 within the shaded region of panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig : cmds ] for our key stellar populations .",
    "these profiles are all normalized to the radial break observed in the youngest population .",
    "in addition to masking foreground stars and background galaxies , a region of significant star formation , located at @xmath91 , @xmath10373 was masked out of fields 1 and 2 to provide a better estimate of the mean surface brightness .",
    "we assigned an equivalent surface brightness to the star count profiles by multiplying the logarithm of the older rgb counts by 2.5 and linearly offsetting the result to match a _",
    "infrared array camera ( irac ) 3.6@xmath11 m surface brightness profile extracted from the same region .",
    "consequently , we find the star count profiles reach a limiting magnitude equivalent to @xmath12ab mag arcsec@xmath13 at 3.6@xmath11 m .    each of the stellar population bins denoted in panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig : cmds ] are substantially brighter than the completeness limits",
    "they are thus less susceptible to spurious detections from cosmic rays and ccd noise that become significant at a lower signal - to - noise ratio . instead",
    ", contamination is expected from unresolved background galaxies , which far outnumber any foreground mw stars . to account for this",
    ", we followed the same analysis used by r - s11 and ran the photometry code on acs images of high-@xmath14 sources with exposure lengths longer than our observations . as these fields are free of any resolvable stars outside of the mw , any detections will thus be contaminants , primarily from background galaxies .",
    "for each of the denoted stellar populations in panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig : cmds ] , we measured contamination from the number density of remaining detections in these `` empty '' archival fields after imposing the selection criteria used by r - s11 .",
    "for the `` old '' , `` intermediate '' , and `` young '' bins we recovered @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 detections per arcsec@xmath18 , respectively .",
    "each of these contaminant measurements are lower than any of the detection rates in the corresponding 7793 populations . averaging the outermost radial bins of each population in 7793 , we , respectively , measured @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 detections per arcsec@xmath18 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , these can be treated as upper limits on the true level of contaminants in each bin .",
    "moreover , using the galaxycount software described in @xcite , we can infer uncertainties on these values due to cosmic variance and poisson noise .",
    "these equate to upper limits on the total number of background galaxies in an acs / wfc field of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 for the respective age bins .",
    "these uncertainties are incorporated into the final error we assign to the profiles .",
    "the lower bound on the profiles due to removing this higher level of contamination , as well as an upper bound resulting from not subtracting any contaminants , are indicated by the shaded regions in the left panel of figure  [ fig : radial ] .",
    "we are able to probe the outskirts of 7793 much deeper than previous integrated light studies , whose profiles do not cover these radii or reach this surface brightness limit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we consequently found that the disk break , @xmath25 , occurs at approximately the same location regardless of the age of the underlying stars , in agreement with observations of the edge - on disk galaxy 4244 @xcite .",
    "this break occurs at 280(5.1kpc ) , internal to the regions covered by @xcite and external to the integrated light profiles of @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that a constant break location calls for a dynamical interpretation , given that a break radius due solely to a star formation threshold is unlikely to remain at the same radius over the lifetime of the galaxy , due to disk growth .",
    "we note that the break is weakest in the oldest population , which also shows a possible second break to a shallower profile around @xmath26 .",
    "this may correspond to a transition in the number counts from a disk - dominated population to one composed primarily of stellar halo stars ( see section  [ sec : thickdisk ] ) .",
    "although the disk break appears at a constant radius for all stellar ages , the profiles in figure  [ fig : radial ] suggest that the slope of the profile does depend on age , both within and beyond the break .",
    "we characterize this slope by fitting the inner and outer profiles to an exponential surface brightness function of the form @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the central surface brightness and @xmath29 is the exponential - disk scale length .",
    "the resulting fits , shown in figure  [ fig : radial ] and table  [ table : fits ] , reveal a smooth increase in the steepness of the outer profile with decreasing age , together with a corresponding flattening of the inner profile .",

    "accounting for different levels of contamination has little effect on the fits .",
    "in isolated simulations of a mw - type galaxy , @xcite found significant migration of stars over several kpc , such that @xmath190% of the outer disk was predominantly formed from migrated stars .",
    "older populations exhibited larger scale lengths than younger populations , because the former were subject to migration for longer .",
    "we can compare our measured profiles to those of @xcite , which are plotted in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : radial ] for the same age ranges used in our cmd analysis .",
    "these profiles were extracted from the simulation at the same inclination as 7793 ( @xmath153 ) , and for comparison with the observations are similarly scaled to the break radius of the youngest stellar population .",
    "the behavior of the profiles in the simulation is qualitatively similar to what is observed in the data .",
    "however , the simulation is not necessarily the best analog for 7793 .",
    "the mass of the simulation contained within 10kpc is approximately @xmath30 , larger than the mass of 7793 , which @xcite measure within 7.35kpc as @xmath31 .",
    "similarly , the radius of the disk break is also larger in the simulation ( 10.2kpc cf .",
    "5.1kpc in 7793 ) .",
    "a potentially better analog to 7793 is the equivalent simulation generated to model 300 in @xcite .",
    "this galaxy is another member of the sculptor group with mass similar to 7793 , although the star formation history ( sfh ) of the system and the lack of a disk break indicate a quiescent formation .",
    "@xcite found little evidence of migration in @xmath0 observations of 300 , and less migration in the 300 simulation than the @xcite model .",
    "this led the authors to suggest that both mass and environment may be factors in radial migration .",
    "as the formation of transient spiral structure is linked to gas accretion and star formation @xcite , such a dependence on environment is to be expected .",
    "this was further demonstrated by @xcite , who note that the comparably massive m33 , which is interacting with m31 , does show signs of radial diffusion @xcite .",
    "we extend this analysis by observing that the @xmath32-band absolute surface brightness of 7793 is on average @xmath11.0mag arcsec@xmath13 brighter than 300 ( see panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig : comparison ] )",
    ". the surface density of the 300 disk may thus be too low to support the transient spiral structures required to drive substantial migration . to better match the properties of",
    "7793 we resimulated the 300 model with a smaller spin parameter to yield a disk with a smaller scale length ( figure  [ fig : comparison ] , panel ( b ) ) , larger rotational velocity ( figure  [ fig : comparison ] , panel ( d ) ) , and higher surface density within the central 4kpc .",
    "these changes resulted in a more concentrated system , with @xmath33 contained within the disk break ( located at 7.7kpc ) .",
    "the stellar disk in this model was also subject to significant radial migration , leading to a similar increase in disk scale length with stellar age as in the @xcite model ( see right panel of figure  [ fig : radial ] and table  [ table : fits ] ) .",
    "the effect is , however , weaker .",
    "we partly attribute this difference to a relative increase in the level of in situ formation beyond the disk break in the 7793 model .",
    "this is manifest in figure  [ fig : radial ] and table  [ table : fits ] by exponential - disk fits to the formation radii of stars located beyond the break .",
    "specifically , the normalized scale lengths are greater in the 7793 model than in the mw simulation .",
    "the 300 model generated by @xcite shows a further increase in this in situ population , which resulted in an even softer disk break .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfh ] compares the cumulative sfh of the main disk of 7793 to the @xcite mw simulation and the new 7793 simulation , both of which show signs of radial migration . to extract the sfh from the @xmath0/acs photometry",
    ", we used the software package match @xcite .",
    "this program uses a maximum likelihood analysis to fit the observed cmd with stars generated from the stellar evolution models of ( * ? ? ? * with updated agb models from @xcite and @xcite , and assuming a @xcite imf and a binary fraction of 40% ) .",
    "the artificial cmd was calculated using a 36@xmath3425 grid in @xmath35 ",
    "@xmath36 $ ] space with bin widths of 0.1dex .",
    "we left the distance modulus and extinction free to be fitted by match , which converged on a distance modulus of @xmath37 and an extinction of @xmath38 .",
    "these are consistent with the literature values of @xmath39 ( r - s11 ) and @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "we constrained the chemical enrichment history to an increasing metallicity .",
    "the overall uncertainty in the sfh , denoted in figure  [ fig : sfh ] by the shaded region , is a combination of both random and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the former are measured from the 1@xmath41 spread in 300 monte carlo realizations of the best - fit solution .",
    "the systematic uncertainties in the isochrones are calculated by varying the @xmath42 and @xmath43 values of the underlying models ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "as the simulations are only evolved for 10gyr , we tie their initial cumulative star formation to the equivalent value measured in 7793 10 gyr ago .",
    "the resulting sfhs of the models show a relatively smooth build up of mass .",
    "this is to be expected , as the simulations are not set in a full cosmological environment .",
    "the sfh of 7793 , as reconstructed from the observations , is consistent with a similar steady sfr for the life of the system",
    ".    even though the sfhs of the two simulations are similar , they exhibit markedly different inner - disk profiles ( see figure  [ fig : radial ] ) .",
    "this suggests dynamical processes dominate the construction of the disk profiles , whether internally by secular processes ( as in * ? ? ? * ) or by externally driven merger processes related to the formation of the host halo ( e.g. , the two controlled simulations presented by * ? ? ?",
    "outer - disk profiles are likely similarly affected , and in the case of the simulations presented here , they predominantly arise from radial diffusion .",
    "figure  [ fig : gradients ] presents a direct comparison of these normalized outer - disk gradients as a function of age .",
    "there is remarkable agreement between the simulations and the 7793 observations , which thus strongly attests to significant migration in 7793 .",
    "@xcite have also addressed radial migration in their cosmological simulations .",
    "they argue that the upturn in the age profile beyond the disk break is principally due to an extended and constant sfr in the outer disk .",
    "however , they do find evidence for some migration , and moreover have studied the outer regions of their cosmological simulations without the effects of such migration ( see their figure  17 ) .",
    "specifically , they found a break still formed in the radial surface brightness profiles , but without migration , the decrease in gradient of the outer - disk profile with increasing stellar age was lost .",
    "stellar radial migration may also be driven by other mechanisms , such as resonances between spiral structures and central bars @xcite , or interactions with satellites @xcite .",
    "these processes may operate in addition to the resonant scattering from transient spiral arms , and so serve to amplify the effect .",
    "however , as 7793 is not host to a significant bar , and as such features are believed to be robust @xcite , the disk is unlikely to have been affected by a central bar .",
    "conversely , as detailed in section  [ sec : harass ] , 7793 may have undergone a recent merger .",
    "such an event could enhance spiral structure in the disk and so increase the level of stellar migration .",
    "the increase in the outer - disk scale length with stellar age , as seen in figure  [ fig : gradients ] , corresponds to an increase in the average age of the outer disk with radius .",
    "this trend , although not ubiquitous , has been confirmed using spectroscopic stellar ages in several nearby disk galaxies @xcite . to assess whether radial migration is the only viable mechanism for setting this trend",
    ", we consider alternate explanations below .",
    "the thick disk typically extends farther radially than the thin disk by a factor of 1.25 , and in low - mass galaxies can account for nearly half the total mass and luminosity @xcite .",
    "as the thick and thin disks can only be separated in high inclination systems , a significant portion of the older outer - disk stars may actually lie in an extended thick disk component .",
    "the smooth change in gradient of the outer radial profile with age argues against a simple two component model .",
    "however , if true , the coincident break radius of both old and young populations suggests that the mechanism propagating the break , and thus setting the outer - disk gradients , applies equally to both components .",
    "furthermore , the thick disk itself may have formed from a migrated population @xcite .",
    "hence , contamination from a thick disk is unlikely to affect the inference of migration .    in the `` old '' rgb population of 7793 plotted in figure  [ fig : radial ] ,",
    "a gradual departure from the outer exponential is seen below 29mag arcsec@xmath13 .",
    "this may indicate a transition to either a thick disk or old stellar halo component . at @xmath44kpc ( @xmath45 ) , this extra component accounts for some @xmath46starsarcsec@xmath13 .",
    "this is approximately a factor of 10 greater than the number of predicted contaminants , and similar to the surface densities attributed to the stellar halos of isolated simulations of disk  satellite interactions from @xcite .",
    "however , such low numbers will have minimal impact on the exponential fits summarized in figure  [ fig : gradients ] .",
    "star formation in outer disks has been characterized by @xcite , who find evidence for spatial correlation between far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) emission , which traces recent star formation , and emission from atomic hydrogen gas ( ) , which comprises most of the interstellar medium in the outer disk .",
    "although @xcite find the overall star formation efficiency to be extremely low in these regions , they observe that this efficiency scales with  gas density .",
    "hence , as the gas disk of 7793 extends beyond the disk break , we expect some of the stars in this region to have formed in situ .",
    "this may partly account for the vertical offset seen in figure  [ fig : gradients ] between the 7793 observations and the @xcite simulation .    to explore this possibility , figure  [ fig : profiles ] plots the surface densities of  gas mass from the things survey @xcite , and the sfr inferred from the _ galex _ ultraviolet atlas of nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "the fuv emission does indeed extend slightly beyond the truncation .",
    "however , using match with this inferred sfr to generate artificial cmds underestimates the number of `` young '' stars observed by almost an order of magnitude ( although this calculation does carry significant uncertainties ) .",
    "the stars may instead have formed in previous episodes of formation not probed by the fuv flux .",
    "indeed , the gas disk extends further still , although , as noted by @xcite , the  disk of 7793 is unusually small .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : profiles ] , the radial extent of the gas is significantly smaller than the rgb distribution . thus , the bulk of the old rgb stars were not likely formed in situ from the  gas reservoir now present in the region , unless the  disk was substantially larger in the past .",
    "many interacting systems are evident in the local group .",
    "our own galaxy is tidally disrupting the small and large magellanic clouds , producing a number of phenomena such as the magellanic stream @xcite .",
    "such interactions strongly affect the distribution of material in outer disks @xcite . in the optical",
    ", 7793 does not appear to be undergoing such a major merger , which would likely disrupt the outer - disk profiles .",
    "however , the  disk of this relatively isolated galaxy is warped , and studies have revealed non - circular motions on the north side , indicative of harassment @xcite , or of an advanced stage of merging ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such minor interactions may explain the lack of gas in the outskirts , and may lead to an extended and heated component @xcite .",
    "moreover , such interactions are also likely to induce the transient spiral features that drive stellar radial migration @xcite . as these transient spiral",
    "arms can last for a couple of gyr ( and potentially much longer in star - forming galaxies due to swing amplification processes involving giant molecular clouds , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the level of stellar radial migration we infer in 7793 may be a direct consequence of a completed past merger .",
    "we have measured the radial surface brightness profiles of three distinct stellar populations across both the inner and outer disk of 7793 .",
    "breaks in the radial profiles are found at the same location regardless of age .",
    "however , older stars show a steeper profile internal to the break and a shallower profile beyond the break in comparison to younger stars .",
    "the observed smooth increase in the outer - disk scale length with age suggests a formation mechanism that continually operates over a significant fraction of the lifetime of the galaxy .    we have compared the surface brightness profiles to _",
    "n_-body simulations that exhibit significant radial stellar diffusion , including a new simulation of a system comparable in mass to 7793 .",
    "the gradients of the outer - disk profiles in these simulations are set almost entirely by migration due to resonant scattering .",
    "the new simulation shows a slightly higher level of in situ formation beyond the disk break relative to @xcite , which corresponds to a flattening of the profiles .",
    "however , the gradients overall match extremely well to the outer disk of 7793 .",
    "we thus argue that the observations presented here are indicative of high levels of stellar radial migration in 7793 .",
