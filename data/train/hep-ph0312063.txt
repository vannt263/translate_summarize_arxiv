    "it is well - known that various observables associated with inclusive rare @xmath19-decays like @xmath20 and @xmath21 sensitively depend on potential new physics contributions .",
    "but even in the absence of new physics these observables are important , because they provide checks on the one - loop structure of the standard model ( sm ) theory and can be used to gain information on the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which are difficult to measure directly .    at present , a lot of data already exists on @xmath24 @xcite and on @xmath25 @xcite and it is expected that in the future also data on the ckm suppressed counterparts , i.e. on @xmath26 and on @xmath27 will become available .",
    "the same holds for experimental information on additional observables , like cp - rate asymmetries or forward - backward asymmetries in the decays @xmath21 .    in order to fully exploit and interpret the experimental data , it is obvious that precise calculations in the sm ( or certain extensions thereof ) are needed . the main problem in the theoretical description of the decay @xmath28 is due to the long - distance contributions induced by @xmath29 resonant states and in principle also by @xmath30 resonant states",
    "the latter are , however , strongly ckm suppressed .",
    "this suppression is not present in the case of @xmath7 , as the ckm factors involved in the contributions from @xmath29 and @xmath30 resonant states are of the same order . when the invariant mass @xmath31 of the lepton pair is close to the mass of a resonance , only model dependent predictions for such long distance contributions are available at present .",
    "it is therefore unclear whether the theoretical uncertainty can be reduced to less than @xmath32 when integrating over these domains @xcite .",
    "however , restricting @xmath31 to a region below the @xmath29 resonances , the long distance effects in @xmath3 are under control .",
    "the same is true for @xmath7 when choosing a region of @xmath31 which is below the @xmath14- and above the @xmath33-resonance regions .",
    "it turns out that in those ranges of @xmath31 the corrections to the pure perturbative picture can be analyzed within the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) .",
    "in particular , all available studies indicate that for the region @xmath34 the non - perturbative effects are below 10@xmath35 @xcite .",
    "consequently , observables like differential decay rates , forward - backward asymmetries and cp - rate asymmetries for @xmath36 can be precisely predicted in this region of @xmath31 using renormalization group improved perturbation theory .",
    "it was pointed out in the literature that the differential decay rate and the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath3 are particularly sensitive to new physics in this kinematical window @xcite .    in the context of the sm there",

    "the aim of the present paper is to close this gap .",
    "the main difference between the calculations for @xmath3 and @xmath40 lies in the contributions of the current - current operators . in the existing nnll calculations of @xmath3",

    "for @xmath7 the contributions generated by @xmath4 and @xmath5 are no longer ckm suppressed and have to be taken into account as well . at first sight",
    ", it seems that the two - loop matrix elements of @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be straightforwardly obtained from those of @xmath41 and @xmath42 by simply taking the limit @xmath44 .",

    "obviously , the analogous quantity for the @xmath6-quark contribution , @xmath47 , can not be used as an expansion parameter , which implies that genuinely new calculations for the @xmath6-quark contributions are needed . as discussed in section  [ section : o1o2 ] , the calculations of certain diagrams associated with @xmath48 are even more involved than those associated with @xmath49 . to derive the new results , we used dimension - shifting techniques in order to reduce certain tensor integrals to scalar ones and integration - by - parts techniques to further simplify the scalar integrals @xcite .    as the main emphasis of this paper is the derivation of the matrix elements @xmath50 at order @xmath51 , we keep the phenomenological analysis relatively short . in particular , we do not take into account power corrections , but merely illustrate how the nnll contributions modify the scale dependences of the branching ratio , the forward - backward asymmetry and the cp - rate asymmetry .",
