    "the broadcasting models and the closely related reconstruction problems on trees were originally studied in statistical physics . since then they have found applications in other areas including biology ( in phylogenetic reconstruction @xcite ) , communication theory ( in the study of noisy computation @xcite ) .",
    "very impressively , these models arise in the study of random constraints satisfaction problems such as random @xmath2-sat , random graph colouring etc .",
    "that is , these models on trees seem to capture some of the most fundamental properties of the corresponding models on random ( hyper)graphs ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the most basic problem in the study of broadcasting models is determining the reconstruction / non - reconstruction threshold .",
    "i.e. whether the configuration of the root affects the distribution of the configuration of the leaves of the tree .",
    "the transition from non - reconstruction to reconstruction can be achieved by adjusting appropriately the parameters of the model .",
    "typically , this transition exhibits threshold behaviour .",
    "so far , the main focus of the study was to determine the precise location of the reconstruction / non - reconstruction threshold in various models .    in this work we focus on the colouring model , for which the reconstruction / non - reconstruction threshold is known @xcite .",
    "we investigate further the phenomenon searching for a natural , i.e. combinatorial , explanation of why the information decays in the non - reconstruction regime .",
    "an explanation which has been , somehow , elusive for a number of colours @xmath2 smaller than the number of children per non - leaf vertex , @xmath0 .",
    "as far as the reconstruction regime is regarded a satisfactory , combinatorial , explanation is already known @xcite . here",
    "we provide a combinatorial view of the problem by providing a coupling between two broadcasting processes which work for @xmath2 well below @xmath0 , i.e. for @xmath9 .",
    "that is , it implies non - reconstruction for @xmath9 . even though the coupling is not optimal , it reveals a great deal of why we have non - reconstruction on trees .",
    "interestingly enough , the decisions that it makes are based on _ local rules _ , i.e. it considers only two successive levels of the tree .",
    "the reader should not take for granted that such a coupling is fairly local for every @xmath2 down to @xmath5 .",
    "finally , recent advances in sampling colouring algorithms ( see @xcite ) allow to relate such a coupling to sampling @xmath2-colourings of random graphs and regular graph for @xmath2 smaller than the expected degree @xmath0 .",
    "see further discussion in section [ sec : furthermot ] .",
    "the broadcasting models on a tree @xmath1 are models in which information is sent from the root over the edges to the leaves .",
    "we assume that the edges represent noisy channels .",
    "for some finite set of spins @xmath11 , a configuration on @xmath1 is an element of @xmath12 , i.e. it is an assignment of a spins of @xmath13 to each vertex of @xmath1 .",
    "the spin of the root @xmath14 is chosen according to some initial distribution over @xmath13 .",
    "the information propagates along the edges of the tree as follows : there is a @xmath15 stochastic matrix @xmath16 such that if the vertex @xmath3 is assigned spin @xmath17 , then its child @xmath18 is assigned spin @xmath19 with probability @xmath20 .    here",
    "we focus on the model which is known as the ( proper ) @xmath2-colouring model ( or @xmath2-state potts model at zero temperature ) .",
    "in particular , we assume that the underlying tree @xmath1 is a complete @xmath0-ary tree , it is finite with height @xmath21 and we let @xmath22 denote the leaves of @xmath1 . also , for the matrix @xmath16 it holds that @xmath23 broadcasting models and more specifically colouring can be considered as gibbs measures on trees . that is , assuming that the broadcasting process over @xmath1 starts with root @xmath14 coloured @xmath17 , then the @xmath2-colouring after the processes has finished is a random @xmath2-colouring of @xmath1 conditional the colouring of @xmath14 .",
    "we let @xmath24 denote the uniform distribution over the configurations of @xmath1 conditional that @xmath14 is assigned @xmath17 .",
    "[ def : reconstuction ] we say that a model is _ reconstructible _ on a tree @xmath1 if there exists @xmath25 for which @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the total variation distance of the projections of @xmath24 and @xmath28 on @xmath29 .",
    "when the above limit is zero for every @xmath30 , then we say that the model has _",
    "non - reconstruction_.    ( non)-reconstructibility expresses how information decays along the tree . as a matter of fact , non - reconstruction is equivalent to the mutual information between the colouring of root @xmath14 and that of @xmath22 going to zero as @xmath21 grows ( see @xcite ) .",
    "also , non - reconstruction is equivalent to gibbs distribution being _ extremal _ ( see @xcite ) .",
    "that is , _ typical _ colourings of the leaves do not provide information for the colouring of the root .",
    "the notion of extremality is weaker than the well - known _ gibbs uniqueness _ where we require that _ every _ configuration of the leaves should not provide information for the colouring of the root .",
    "an early work about reconstruction / non - reconstruction problems on tree is that of kesten and stigum in @xcite .",
    "the authors there present a general result for reconstruction , the so called `` kesten - stigum bound '' that states that reconstruction holds when @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the second largest eigenvalue of @xmath16 in absolute value .",
    "this bound is sharp for a lot of models , e.g. ising model ( see @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that there are models where the kesten - stigum bound is not sharp , e.g. the binary models where @xmath16 is sufficiently asymmetric or ferromagnetic @xmath33-state potts model with @xmath33 large . as far as the ( proper ) @xmath2-colouring model is regarded",
    "the kesten - stigum bound is not tight but we know the reconstruction / non reconstruction threshold quite precisely .",
    "from @xcite we derive the following theorem :    [ thrm : nonrecon ] for fixed @xmath34 and sufficiently large @xmath0 , the following is true for the @xmath2-colouring model on a @xmath0-ary tree @xmath1 :    * if @xmath35 , then the model is non - reconstructible . * if @xmath36 , then the model is reconstructible .",
    "_ we should remark that reconstruction bound is from @xcite and is based on analysing a simple reconstruction algorithm . as a matter of fact the reconstruction condition",
    "there is more precise than thar in theorem [ thrm : nonrecon ] , i.e. it should hold @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "_ the non - reconstruction bound is from @xcite .",
    "the result in @xcite provides a very precise condition for non - reconstruction , i.e. @xmath38 $ ] . in @xcite",
    "the reader can find further interesting results about the problem . _    unfortunately , neither of @xcite give explicit evidence on why do we have the phenomenon of information decay on the trees .",
    "what is the natural ( combinatorial ) reason why such a result should be true .",
    "searching for an explanation for the non - reconstruction we observe that theorem [ thrm : nonrecon ] with coupling lemma ( see @xcite ) imply the following corollary .",
    "[ cor : thecoupling ] for any fixed @xmath34 , sufficiently large @xmath0 and @xmath39 the following is true for the @xmath2-colourings of the @xmath0-ary tree @xmath1 : any two broadcasting processes which assign the root different colours can be coupled such that the probability of having vertices that take different colour assignments in the two processes reduces as we move away from the root .",
    "that is , somehow there is a rule which specifies how someone should correspond the choices of colourings in the first broadcasting process to the choices of the other process such that the probability of having a set of vertices that take different colours reduces as the distance of the set from the root increases .",
    "the reader should note that the construction of such a coupling is far from trivial for any @xmath8 .    here",
    "we address the problem of constructing a coupling as specified in corollary [ cor : thecoupling ] , based on _ local combinatorial _ rules . by local we mean",
    "that once the first process decides on colouring a _ fairly small _ set of vertices , then we should be able to know how the other process should colour the same set of vertices .",
    "such a construction is an interplay among the combinatorial structure of the tree , its colourings and the gibbs distribution of the colourings . in this work",
    "we provide the following result : +    * main result : * we construct a coupling for two broadcasting processes on a @xmath0-ary tree @xmath1 that is combinatorial , local and has the properties specified in corollary [ cor : thecoupling ] for @xmath40 , for fixed @xmath34 and sufficiently large @xmath0 .",
    "it is believed that the non - reconstruction / reconstruction phenomenon determines the dynamic phase transition in the random graph @xmath41 @xcite . where @xmath41 denotes the random graph on @xmath42 vertices and @xmath43 edges while we let @xmath0 be the expected degree , i.e. @xmath44 .",
    "in this context we take @xmath0 to be fixed .",
    "the _ dynamic phase transition _ is related to the geometry of @xmath2-colourings of @xmath41 and it was predicted by statistical physicists in @xcite , based on ingenious however mathematically non - rigorous arguments .",
    "let us be more specific . for typical instances of @xmath45",
    ", it is well known that the chromatic number @xmath46 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the 1-step replica symmetry breaking hypothesis ( see @xcite ) suggests that considering the space of @xmath2-colourings of @xmath41 as @xmath2 varies from large to small , we will observe the following phenomenon : for @xmath47 ( i.e. greater than @xmath48 ) all but a vanishing fraction of @xmath2-colourings form a giant connected ball .",
    "the notion of connectedness suggests that starting from any colouring we can traverse the whole set of solutions by moving in steps .",
    "each steps involves changing only a very small -constant- number of colour assignments .",
    "however , for @xmath49 the set of @xmath2-colouring shatters into exponentially many connected balls with each ball containing an exponentially small fraction of all @xmath2-colourings .",
    "any two colourings in different balls are separated with linear hamming distance . for a rigorous description of the shattering phenomenon see @xcite .",
    "we should remark that the dynamic phase transition in @xmath41 ( roughly ) coincides with the extremality /non - extremality transition of the colourings in a @xmath0-ary tree .",
    "further investigation into this coincidence yield the authors in @xcite to developed a sufficient condition for the tree and random graph reconstruction problem to coincide . in @xcite",
    "this condition was verified for symmetric models like colouring .",
    "it is believed we can have approximate random colouring of @xmath41 in the whole regime of non - reconstruction . recently , the author of this paper in @xcite suggested a new algorithm for sampling colourings of @xmath41 with constant expected degree .",
    "interestingly enough the accuracy of the algorithm depends directly on non - reconstruction conditions .",
    "the idea there is that we first remove edges of @xmath41 until it becomes so simple that we can take a random colouring in polynomial time .",
    "then , we _ rebuild _ the graph by adding the deleted edges one by one while at the same time we _ update the colouring _ of some vertices so as the colouring of the graph with the added edge to remain random .",
    "this algorithm requires at least @xmath50 colours .",
    "however , since its accuracy depends on non - reconstruction conditions it is reasonable to expect that we can have an improvement by requiring even less colours.the algorithm does not exploit fully its dependency on non - reconstruction due to its colouring _ update rule_. a new , improved , update rule is needed .",
    "such an improvement could possibly reduce the minimum number of colours that the algorithm requires down to @xmath51 .",
    "very good candidates for improved updating rules are couplings as the one we present here .",
    "of course so as to use it for sampling it requires solving non - trivial technical issues ( which go beyond @xcite ) .",
    "the close relation between random colourings of @xmath0-regular trees and the random colourings of @xmath41 with expected degree @xmath0 suggests that such an extension is a reasonable thing to ask .",
    "the situation is very similar if someone considers sampling colourings of random @xmath0-regular graphs .",
    "_ of course , there are other approaches for sampling colouring that vary from combinatorial ones ( e.g. markov chain monte carlo @xcite ) to numerical ones ( e.g. belief propagation @xcite ) .",
    "however , it seems that the setting in @xcite is substantially easier to analyse for @xmath2 being a small function of @xmath0 .",
    "_      assume that we have the @xmath0-ary tree @xmath1 and two broadcasting processes .",
    "the first one @xmath2-colours @xmath1 as @xmath52 and the other as @xmath53 .",
    "assume that the root @xmath14 of @xmath1 is coloured as @xmath54 and @xmath55 while @xmath56 .",
    "consider first the following recursive _ naive coupling _ of the two processes .",
    "start from the root @xmath14 down to the leaves . for each vertex",
    "@xmath57 such that @xmath58 couple every @xmath59 , descendant of @xmath18 , by using identical coupling , i.e. @xmath60 . on the other hand , if @xmath61 , then couple the colourings of the children of @xmath18 according to an optimal coupling for each child .    the above coupling has the property that for any vertex @xmath59 such that @xmath62 , under both @xmath52 and @xmath53 , there is a path which includes @xmath14 and @xmath59 and its vertices are coloured using only @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "that is the _ paths of disagreement _ in both colourings propagates as bicolored paths that use the colours @xmath65 . for a number of colours @xmath8",
    ", we expect that the above coupling generates an ever increasing number of disagreeing vertices as it moves from the root down to the leaves . as a matter of fact the number of disagreeing vertices at each level grows as a _ supercritical _",
    "branching process , i.e. the probability of having disagreement at the leaves is strictly positive , regardless of their distance from the root .",
    "our coupling improves on the naive one .",
    "consider the root @xmath14 and let @xmath66 be the set of vertices which contain the @xmath17-th child of @xmath14 and the children of @xmath17 ( i.e. two levels below the root ) .",
    "we call `` bad '' the colouring @xmath67 if @xmath68 and @xmath17 has a child @xmath19 such that @xmath69 .",
    "similarly , @xmath70 is bad if @xmath71 and @xmath17 has a child @xmath19 such that @xmath72 .",
    "it turns out that the challenge is to deal with these bad colourings .",
    "the problem reveals by just considering the naive coupling .",
    "there , if @xmath67 is bad , then @xmath70 should be bad too .",
    "for such a pair the identity coupling is precluded and the creation of disagreements is inevitable . for @xmath8 , the naive coupling fails due to the fact that it generates _ too many _ bad pairs @xmath73 .    it is direct to see that for @xmath8 it is unavoidable that there are a lot of bad colouring among @xmath67s and @xmath70s . the basic idea , here , is to avoid coupling them together . to this end",
    "we use the following fact which is true as long as @xmath74 : consider @xmath75 conditional that a ) it is a bad and b ) there is at least one colour that is not used by @xmath75 . for such @xmath75",
    "it is highly likely that there is another child of @xmath14 , e.g. vertex @xmath76 , such that the joint distribution of the colouring of the children of @xmath76 under @xmath77 is identical to the joint distribution of the children of @xmath19 under the colouring @xmath75 . for convenience , we call @xmath77 @xmath19-good , since @xmath75 is bad.s we can find good colourings among @xmath67s , as well . ]",
    "based on the above observation , the target now is to couple the colourings @xmath67s and @xmath70s such that if @xmath67 satisfies the conditions a ) and b ) , stated above , then @xmath70 is a @xmath17-good colouring and vice versa satisfies the conditions a ) and b ) , then @xmath75 is a @xmath19-good colouring . ] .",
    "then we can have identical coupling for the colourings of the children of the vertex @xmath17 . on the other hand , for @xmath67 ( or @xmath70 ) a bad colouring that either uses all of the @xmath2 colours or there is not any @xmath17-good colouring , it is inevitable that disagreements are generated .",
    "for all the rest colourings , i.e. neither bad nor good we have identical coupling .",
    "in the next section we provide further details about our coupling on a more technical basis .    working",
    "as described in the previous paragraph , the number of disagreements drops dramatically , compared to naive coupling . as a matter of fact the number of disagreeing vertices grows as a _ subcritical _ branching process , i.e. the probability of having disagreement at the leaves drops exponentially with the distance of the leaves from the root .",
    "_ one could hope that employing directly the ideas of this improved coupling to larger neighbourhoods could reduce the bound for @xmath2 down to @xmath78 . however , technical reasons suggest that a non - trivial improvement is required for getting @xmath2 below @xmath79 , rather than only considering larger neighbourhoods . _    _ the update rule in the sampling algorithm in @xcite is , somehow , an extension to @xmath41 of what we call here as _",

    "<S> interestingly enough , the decisions that it makes are based on _ local rules _ , i.e. it considers only two successive levels of the tree . </S>",
    "<S> it should not be taken for granted that such a coupling is local for any @xmath2 down to @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we relate the existence of such a coupling to sampling @xmath2-colourings of sparse random graphs , with expected degree @xmath0 , for @xmath10 . </S>"
