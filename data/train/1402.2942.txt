    "in the last 15 years , since its inception in the context of linear quantum mechanics  @xcite , the study of systems with @xmath1 symmetry has gained tremendous momentum .",
    "while it was originally proposed as a modification / extension of quantum mechanics , its purview has gradually become substantially wider .",
    "this stemmed to a considerable degree from the realization that other areas such as optics might be ideally suited not only for its theoretical study  @xcite , but also for its experimental realization  @xcite .",
    "hence , this effort has motivated a wide range of explorations focusing , among others , on the study of solitary waves and breathers in lattice and continuum systems  @xcite , as well as on the complementary aspect of low - dimensional ( oligomer or plaquette ) settings  @xcite .",
    "most of the above developments , however , have focused on the realm of schrdinger type operators . however , other classes of hamiltonian wave - bearing systems are of considerable interest in their own right , with a notable example being klein - gordon equations .",
    "this arises not only in the context of field theories ( as e.g. in high energy / particle physics )  @xcite , but also in that of discrete ( lattice nonlinear dynamical ) systems with applications both to mechanics ( e.g. , arrays of coupled pendula ; see e.g. for a recent example  @xcite ) and to electrical systems ( such as circuits consisting of e.g. capacitive and inductive elements  @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to note here that both at the mechanical level  @xcite and at the electrical one  @xcite realizations of @xmath1 symmetry and its breaking have been recently implemented , while a klein - gordon setting has also been explored theoretically for so - called @xmath1 symmetric nonlinear metamaterials and the formation of gain - driven discrete breathers therein  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to formulate a prototypical field theoretic setting where gain and loss coexist in a balanced @xmath1 symmetric form in a klein - gordon model , around a central point which , without loss of generality , will be assumed to be at @xmath2 .",
    "this addition to the standard klein - gordon model @xmath3 will come into the form of a `` dashpot '' term @xmath4 .",
    "however , contrary to the usual setting where it has a negative definite prefactor incorporating dissipation ( see e.g. the relevant local dissipation term in  @xcite ) , here this term will have a non - definite sign .",
    "in fact , to preserve the @xmath1 symmetry , @xmath5 will be anti - symmetric so that the transformation @xmath6 will leave the equation invariant .",
    "this suggests that there is a region where @xmath7 , representing ( without loss of generality ) the `` lossy '' side of the medium , and a region where @xmath8 , representing the `` gain '' side of the medium . for definiteness , in our numerical simulations we will assume that @xmath9 for @xmath10 ( lossy side ) and @xmath8 for @xmath11 ( gain side ) .",
    "our principal aim is to explore the impact of this term on the stability properties of the coherent structures of this equation .",
    "arguably , the most important among these are the ubiquitous kinks ( heteroclinic connections in the ode phase space which connect two distinct fixed points ) . of substantial interest",
    "are also the relatively fragile breathers that exist in a time periodic exponentially localized form for some models ( such as the sine - gordon equation with @xmath12 ) , but do not exist as such for others ( such as the @xmath13 model with @xmath14 ) . here , given the fragility of the latter ( breathers ) , we will focus solely on the former ( kinks ) .",
    "moreover , even for the kinks we will consider the simpler stationary problem , as the presence of @xmath5 and its breaking of translational invariance destroys the lorentz invariance which produces traveling solutions out of static ones .",
    "hence , it is not at all clear that traveling solutions exist in the model in the presence of the @xmath1 symmetric perturbation considered herein .",
    "nevertheless , as the static problem @xmath15 is _ unaffected _ by our unusual antisymmetric dashpot , the steady state ( kink ) solutions persist in the proposed model and are , in fact , still available in explicit analytical form . for the sine - gordon model they read @xmath16 ,",
    "while for @xmath13 , they are @xmath17 . in each case , they can be centered at any @xmath18 along the real line .",
    "the fundamental question is therefore one of their spectral stability and it is that which we will try to resolve herein .",
    "in particular , our mathematical analysis and numerical computations lead to the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "if @xmath19 , i.e. , the kink is centered at the interface between gain and loss , then the spectrum is unaffected ( with the exception of a possible shift of point spectrum imaginary eigenvalues which can move along the imaginary spectral axis ) and the kink is spectrally stable ; 2 .",
    "if the kink is centered on the `` lossy '' side of the medium , the kink will be spectrally stable ( excluding the possibility of an eigenvalue with a very small real part ) , with one of the formerly neutral eigenvalues ( associated with translation ) moving to the left half plane ; 3 .",
    "if the kink is centered on the `` gain '' side of the medium , it will be spectrally unstable with one of the formerly neutral eigenvalues ( associated with translation ) moving to the right half plane .",
    "our presentation is structured as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the models and their solutions , and we set up the relevant spectral problem . in section 3",
    "we prove a general result about the spectrum of a quadratic eigenvalue problem which can be considered to be a generalization of the problem associated with our two case examples . in section 4",
    "we present some numerical computations which illustrate the theory .",
    "we conclude in section 5 with a brief discussion of our conclusions , and provide a possible list of future questions to be addressed .",
    "we consider the following basic pde @xmath20 here @xmath21 is a smooth nonlinear function that depends on the field @xmath22 , and @xmath5 is a function accounting for the presence of gain / loss in the system . for @xmath23 , and for some class of nonlinearities , there exist static kink solutions @xmath24 , which will be the main object of consideration here .",
    "these will satisfy the following ode @xmath25 as mentioned in the introduction , we will be particularly interested in the following examples :    * the sine - gordon field theory , @xmath26 , and the kink solution will be @xmath27 * the @xmath13 field theory , @xmath28 , and the kink assumes the form @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath1 symmetry requires that the equation be invariant under the mapping @xmath6 ( spatial reflection and time reversal ) .",
    "clearly , the operator @xmath30 preserves the symmetry . in order for the operator @xmath31 to also have this property ,",
    "we need @xmath5 to be an odd function .",
    "this will be assumed throughout the rest of this paper .",
    "perturbing about the kink solution via the substitution @xmath32 , we obtain the linearized pde @xmath33 in our examples we have that @xmath34 so that @xmath35 is an effective potential which decays exponentially fast as @xmath36 .",
    "we will henceforth assume that @xmath5 is also exponentially localized .",
    "introducing the schrdinger operator @xmath37 with domain @xmath38 in the form @xmath39 we can rewrite the linearized problem as @xmath40 upon making the transformation @xmath41 we have the spectral problem @xmath42 if the real part of the eigenvalue is positive , the wave will be spectrally unstable ; otherwise , the wave is spectrally stable .",
    "the schrdinger operator @xmath37 is self - adjoint , and by weyl s theorem its essential spectrum is given by @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , since solutions to the existence problem ( [ 7 ] ) are invariant under spatial translation , it will be the case that the operator has a nontrivial kernel with @xmath44 .",
    "alternatively , this fact follows immediately upon differentiating with respect to @xmath45 . in the next section",
    "we will stay away from the concrete @xmath37 that arises in our application , and instead we will work with a general schrdinger operator which satisfies relevant properties .",
    "we have properly motivated our study of the following spectral problem : @xmath46 here @xmath47 represents a self - adjoint schrdinger operator on @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 is a smooth function which decays exponentially fast , @xmath51 we assume that @xmath5 is a smooth _ odd _ function which satisfies a similar exponential decay estimate as @xmath50 .",
    "the exponential decay assumption on the potential @xmath50 means that @xmath47 is a relatively compact perturbation of the constant coefficient operator @xmath52 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  3.1 ) for the details ) .",
    "the essential spectrum of @xmath47 is the spectrum of @xmath53 , and is given by @xmath54 since @xmath47 is a relatively compact perturbation of an operator of fredholm index zero , the rest of the spectrum will be comprised of point eigenvalues , and each of these will have finite algebraic multiplicity .",
    "moreover , basic sturm - liouville theory tells us that the point eigenvalues will be real and simple ( e.g. , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  2.3 ) ) .",
    "regarding the point spectrum of the schrdinger operator @xmath47 , we make the following spectral assumptions :    [ ass:31 ] the point spectrum of @xmath47 , say @xmath55 , is nonnegative and is ordered as @xmath56 the associated eigenfunctions are labelled as @xmath57 .",
    "quadratic eigenvalue problems are well - studied , and we refer to @xcite for some relevant results and references .",
    "one important result that we will use is that the quadratic problem ( [ e:31 ] ) is equivalent to the linear eigenvalue problem @xmath58 as a consequence of this equivalence and the decay assumptions on @xmath50 and @xmath5 , the operator @xmath59 is fredholm of index zero for all @xmath60 which is not in the essential spectrum , @xmath61 .",
    "the essential spectrum is found by considering the spectrum of the asymptotic operator @xmath62 ( the asymptotic operator is found by taking the limit @xmath63 for @xmath64 ) .",
    "the essential spectrum is straightforward to compute , and we find it is purely imaginary , @xmath65\\cup[{\\mathrm{i}}\\sigma,+{\\mathrm{i}}\\infty).\\ ] ] regarding the point spectrum , @xmath66 , because @xmath64 is a relatively compact perturbation of @xmath67 it will be the case that there are only a finite number of such eigenvalues , and each has finite algebraic multiplicity .",
    "moreover , we have the symmetries as detailed below :    [ le:31 ] suppose that @xmath68 . if @xmath50 is even , then the point spectrum satisfies the hamiltonian symmetry , @xmath69 . if @xmath50 is not even , then all that can be said is the point spectrum is symmetric with respect to the real axis , @xmath70 .    setting @xmath71",
    ", the fact that @xmath64 has only real - valued entries implies that @xmath72 thus , the spectral symmetry with respect to the real axis is established .",
    "now suppose that @xmath50 is even .",
    "setting @xmath73 gives @xmath74 so that the quadratic problem becomes @xmath75 the schrdinger operator @xmath47 is invariant under the spatial reflection . upon setting @xmath76 we recover the original eigenvalue problem , i.e. , @xmath77",
    "thus , under the assumption that @xmath50 is even we see that if @xmath60 is an eigenvalue with associated eigenfunction @xmath78 , then @xmath79 is an eigenvalue with associated eigenfunction @xmath80 .",
    "since the origin is an eigenvalue for @xmath47 with eigenfunction @xmath81 , it will be an eigenvalue for @xmath64 with associated eigenfunction @xmath82 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath47 is a schrdinger operator , it is clear that the geometric multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue is one . regarding the algebraic structure of this eigenvalue we have :    [ le:5 ]",
    "suppose that @xmath83 is sufficiently small .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath84 has algebraic multiplicity two if @xmath85 otherwise , it has algebraic multiplicity one .",

    "now that we understand the spectral structure at the origin , we consider the question of whether or not there can be eigenvalues which are arbitrarily large in magnitude with nonzero real part . before doing so , let us consider the structure of the spectrum when @xmath98 .",
    "the eigenvalue problem becomes @xmath100 so that the eigenvalues for @xmath64 are intimately related to those for @xmath47 .",
    "indeed , as a consequence of the spectral assumption on @xmath47 , we see that there are precisely @xmath101 purely imaginary simple eigenvalues with positive imaginary part @xmath102 the spectral symmetry of lemma [ le:31 ] guarantees that there are @xmath101 purely imaginary eigenvalues with negative imaginary part . an associated eigenfunction for each eigenvalue with positive imaginary part is @xmath103 .",
    "thus , arbitrarily large eigenvalues with nonzero real part for @xmath83 can exist only if they are somehow ejected from the essential spectrum .    before continuing",
    ", we shall need the following technical result , which is sometimes called _ limited absorption principle_. the limited absorption principle is a standard result , whose proof is based on appropriate estimates for the jost solutions of the corresponding operator @xmath104 .",

    "we now consider the problem of whether or not _ any _ eigenvalues can be ejected from the essential spectrum when @xmath83 .",
    "alternatively , one can think of the following as a discussion on the resonances of a schrdinger operator . here",
    "we rely on the discussion of _ edge bifurcations _ for schrdinger operators as presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  9.5 ) .",
    "recalling the spectral symmetry about the real axis , assume that the imaginary part of @xmath60 is positive .",
    "upon setting @xmath131 the eigenvalue problem @xmath132 can be rewritten as @xmath133 an important point here is that the branch point @xmath134 has been transformed to @xmath135 .",
    "the transformation defines a two - sheeted riemann surface in a neighborhood of the branch point .",
    "the physical sheet of this transformation , @xmath136 , corresponds to eigenvalues for the original problem , while the resonance sheet , @xmath137 , corresponds to resonance poles for the original problem . in a neighborhood of this branch point",
    "one can construct an analytic evans function , @xmath138 , which has the property @xmath139 if @xmath140 is an eigenvalue ( physical sheet ) , or if @xmath140 is a resonance pole ( resonance sheet ) .",

    "reflectionless _ potential ,",

    "since the evans function is analytic , in a neighborhood of the branch point it will have no other possible zeros .",
    "now suppose that @xmath83 is small .",
    "the zero at the branch point will move to either the physical sheet or the resonance sheet , and in either case it will be of @xmath146 .",

    "it is shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  9.5.1 ) that the expansion for this zero as applied to this problem is given by @xmath149 here @xmath141 is given in .",
    "note that to leading order this zero is purely imaginary on the riemann surface , and is consequently on the boundary between the physical sheet and the resonance sheet .",
    "if it moves onto the physical sheet , it will create an eigenvalue given by @xmath150 the eigenvalue created by the edge bifurcation will be @xmath151 close to the branch point . because the leading order term in the expansion of @xmath152 is purely imaginary , the @xmath151 term in the expansion is purely real .",
    "thus , if the eigenvalue has a nonzero real part it will necessarily be of @xmath153 . if the zero moves onto the resonance sheet , no eigenvalue is created . on the other hand ,",
    "if the potential is not reflectionless , then no zeros will come out of the branch point .",

    "each of the nonzero eigenvalues will move a distance of @xmath146 . indeed , upon writing @xmath156 and using the fact an eigenfunction associated to the eigenvalue @xmath157 is @xmath103 , we see that after using standard perturbation theory ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "in this work , we have introduced a @xmath1-symmetric variant of the widely relevant ( in mechanical , electrical and other physical systems as e.g. in particle physics ) klein - gordon field theory .",
    "we have done so by incorporating an anti - symmetric dashpot term featuring gain on one side of the domain and loss symmetrically on the other side . while such @xmath201-symmetric klein - gordon settings are starting to be analyzed even experimentally at the discrete level ( especially in the case of few nodes ) , the case of the continuum limit is virtually unexplored .",
    "we have seen that for such systems , the stationary kink states of the model persist ; however , their spectral stability is dramatically affected .",
    "if the kinks of interest are centered at the exact interface between the gain and loss , then they preserve their spectral stability , a feature that our theorem [ thm:31 ] allows us to establish rigorously .",
    "if they are centered on the lossy side , they become further stabilized with parts of the point spectrum moving to the left half plane ( either on the real axis or as complex eigenvalue pairs ) . in this case , if there is a spectral instability , it is weak , for the real part of the unstable eigenvalue will be @xmath153 .",
    "on the other hand , by means of the symmetries of the model , it is evident that when they are centered on the gain side of the medium , then the relevant eigenvalues bifurcate to the right half plane , giving rise to instability .    while the above lay some of the foundations of the subject of @xmath201-symmetric klein - gordon field theories ,",
    "there are numerous questions that remain open both as regards the existence and in connection to the stability properties of coherent structures in such models .",
    "a feature that we did not touch upon , which our preliminary observations suggest that it is even numerically quite technically challenging is the fate of the resonance in the case of @xmath202 .",
    "understanding whether this edge bifurcation from the continuous spectrum may contribute to an instability in such a setting would be a topic of theoretical and numerical interest in its own right .",
    "in addition , it would be interesting to develop an instability index theory for such quadratic polynomials in which the linear coefficient is not definite . as was seen in @xcite in the case of quadratic matrix polynomials , if the linear coefficient is definite , then the total number of eigenvalues with positive real part is bounded above by the total number of negative eigenvalues for the schrdinger operator @xmath47 .",
    "unfortunately , the proof of this result heavily depended upon the definiteness of the linear term , and consequently it is not clear as to how it can be extended to the problem considered in this paper .    as noted earlier there are states which are genuinely time - dependent in klein - gordon models , and these states include the traveling kinks and the breathers . while one may be inclined to doubt the existence of genuinely traveling kinks given the spatial inhomogeneity imposed by the gain - loss profile , it would be interesting to explore the dynamics of such waves . for the breathers",
    "it is unclear whether the @xmath1-symmetric extension will preserve their structure ( and if so , under which conditions this may occur ) .",
