    "artificial neural network and its application has been a hot topic in recent decades , including the cellular neural networks , hopfield neural networks , and cohen - grossberg neural networks , etc .",
    "especially , as a great progress in the history of neural networks , hinton et al . in 2006 proposed the deep learning algorithm @xcite by using the generalized back - propagation algorithm for training multi - layer neural networks , which has been shown a powerful role in many practical fields , such as natural language processing , image recognition , bioinformatics , recommendation systems , and so on .",
    "generally , the investigated neural network models are mainly defined by ordinary differential equations ( odes ) ; however , partial differential equations ( pdes ) can describe the real things or events more exactly .",
    "for example , diffusion effect can not be avoided in the neural networks model when electrons are moving in asymmetric electromagnetic field , and in the chemical reactions many complex patterns are generated by the reaction - diffusion effects @xcite .",
    "there have been many results about the dynamical behaviors of neural networks with reaction - diffusion terms , for example , the existence , uniqueness and global exponential stability of the equilibrium point of delayed reaction - diffusion recurrent neural networks were investigated in @xcite ; a better result on stability analysis was given by analyzing the role of the reaction - diffusion terms in @xcite-@xcite ; @xcite investigated the exponential stability of impulsive neural networks with time - varying delays and reaction - diffusion terms ; @xcite studied the global @xmath0-stability of reaction - diffusion neural networks with unbounded time - varying delays and dirichlet boundary conditions ; and @xcite discussed the existence and global exponential stability of anti - periodic mild solution for reaction - diffusion hopfield neural networks systems with time - varying delays .    neural network can be categorized into the scope of complex networks , while synchronization and its control problem @xcite-@xcite has been an important issue for complex networks , which has attracted many researcher interests from various disciplines , like mathematics , computer science , physics , biology , etc .",
    "synchronization means that all the nodes have the same dynamical behavior under some local protocols between the communication with each node s neighbours , therefore , synchronization is the collective behavior of the whole network while the communication protocol is distributed .",
    "many synchronization patterns have been investigated , like complete synchronization , cluster synchronization , finite - time ( or fixed - time ) synchronization , and so on .    in this paper , we will study the complete synchronization and its control problem for linearly coupled neural networks with reaction - diffusion terms .",
    "hitherto , many works have been presented on this problem , see @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite , the authors discussed the asymptotic and exponential synchronization for a class of neural networks with time - varying and distributed delays and reaction - diffusion terms ; @xcite-@xcite investigated the adaptive synchronization problem for coupled neural networks with reaction - diffusion terms ; @xcite studied the @xmath0-synchronization problem for coupled neural networks with reaction - diffusion terms and unbounded time - varying delays ; @xcite-@xcite discussed the synchronization for fuzzy or stochastic neural networks with reaction - diffusion terms and unbounded time delays ; @xcite proposed a general array model of coupled reaction - diffusion neural networks with hybrid coupling , which was composed of spatial diffusion coupling and state coupling ; @xcite-@xcite discussed the synchronization problems of reaction - diffusion neural networks based on the output strict passivity property in which the input and output variables varied with the time and space variables ; and @xcite investigated the pinning control problem for two types of coupled neural networks with reaction - diffusion terms : the state coupling and the spatial diffusion coupling .",
    "as for the control technique , except for the continuous strategy , discontinuous control strategies are more economic and have better application value , including impulsive control , sample - data control , intermittent control , etc .",
    "for example , @xcite-@xcite discussed the impulsive control and synchronization for delayed neural networks with reaction - diffusion terms ; @xcite investigated the synchronization problem of reaction - diffusion neural networks with time - varying delays via stochastic sampled - data controller ; @xcite-@xcite studied the synchronization for neural networks with reaction - diffusion terms under periodically intermittent control technique . in the real world , the periodically intermittent control @xcite is rare , and a more general intermittent control technique , called the aperiodically intermittent control , is proposed to realize synchronization of complex networks , see @xcite .",
    "moreover , the authors in @xcite and @xcite also consider the complete synchronization and the cluster synchronization for complex networks with time - varying delays and constant time delay respectively .",
    "based on the above discussions , in this paper , we will investigate _ the complete synchronization problem for linearly coupled neural networks with time - varying delay and reaction - diffusion terms and hybrid coupling via aperiodically intermittent control_.    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ pre ] , some necessary definitions , lemmas and notations are given . in section",
    "[ main ] , the network model with constant aperiodically intermittent control gain is first proposed and the criteria for complete synchronization are obtained .",
    "then , we apply the adaptive approach on the aperiodically intermittent control gain by designing a useful adaptive rule , and its validity is also rigorously proved . in section [ nu ] ,",
    "numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the correctness of theoretical results .",
    "finally , this paper is concluded in section [ conclude ] .",

    "of course , only the state diffusion ( the first term in ( [ controlnew ] ) ) or the spatial diffusion ( the second term in ( [ controlnew ] ) ) can also be used as the pinning control technique , see @xcite , but in order to consider them together , we adopt the form of ( [ controlnew ] ) . as for the negative sign for the spatial diffusion coupling term",

    ", we assume that the outer coupling matrices are the same for state coupling term and spatial diffusion coupling term .",

    "[ red ] from the process of proof , one can find that the diffusive term @xmath137 is beneficial for the complete synchronization , whose role can be expressed by the parameter @xmath138 .",

    "especially , when the diffusive term @xmath137 vanishes , the synchronization speed is the smallest .",
    "the spatial diffusion coupling term @xmath95 is helpful for the synchronization from the proof , this is the reason why we design the spatial diffusion coupling term as this form . on the other hand ,",
    "the normal coupling form @xmath142 may play a negative role for synchronization .",
    "the concept of spatial diffusion coupling was first proposed by works @xcite . in these papers ,",
    "the coupling term is chosen as the normal coupling form as @xmath142 .",
    "therefore , in their handling with the spatial diffusion coupling term , they used the original reaction - diffusion term @xmath137 discussed in remark [ red ] to suppress the negative effect of the spatial diffusion coupling term ( see ( 38 ) in @xcite ) , while in this paper the spatial diffusion coupling term can help to facilitate the synchronization , this can be regarded as the main difference between this paper with previous works .    in some cases , the parameters in the network model are unknown , or the real required coupling strength is smaller than the calculated value by theorem [ thm1 ] .",
