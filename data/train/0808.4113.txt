    "the model requires a total dust mass of @xmath44.27@xmath65 and results in a vertical visible optical depth of @xmath66 at @xmath44 and a mid - plane radial optical depth of @xmath67 .",

    "debes et al .

    "but the scattering spectra of these minerals and ice are too neutral at @xmath25@xmath790.51.6@xmath7 to match the steep red spectral slope of the reflectance spectrum of the @xmath0 disk",
    ". debes et al .",
    "( 2008 ) therefore resorted to organic materials .",
    "they found that tholin or its mixture with other dust species ( e.g. water ice or olivine ) are able to reproduce the observed red spectral slope .",
    "this led them to suggest that `` _ the presence of organic material is the most plausible explanation for the observations _ '' , with a cautionary note that `` ... _ longer wavelength scattered light observations will further constrain the ( tholin - based ) grain models , particularly around 3.84@xmath7 , where a large absorption feature is seen for different grain sizes of tholins .",
    "this would help to directly confirm whether titan tholins are an adequate proxy for the material in orbit around hr4796a .",
    "_ ''    however , as shown in figure [ fig : kml_refl ] , simple porous dust models consisting of dust species ( amorphous silicate , amorphous carbon , water ice ) which are commonly considered to dominate in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , envelopes around evolved stars , and dust disks around young stars closely reproduce the observed reflectance spectrum of the @xmath0 disk .",
    "our model provides at least a viable alternative to the tholin - based models of debes et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . while the tholin organic dust model predicts a strong feature around 3.84@xmath7 characteristic of tholin ( debes et al .",
    "2008 ) , the porous dust model presented here predicts a strong band at @xmath43.1@xmath7 , attributed to the o ",

    "( 2008 ) were made from dc discharge of 90% n@xmath77 and 10% ch@xmath80 gas mixture ( khare et al .",
    "they are extremely n - rich and optically very different from amorphous carbon .",
    "the dust in the hr4796a disk should be continuously replenished .",
    "this is indicated by the low size cutoff @xmath36 ( of a few micrometers ) of the dust required to reproduce the reflectance spectrum ( see  2 and table [ tab : para ] ) combined with considerations of dust lifetimes based on the radiation pressure and poynting - robertson effects ( see fig.9 of li & lunine 2003a ) . the replenishing source would likely arise from collisional cascades of larger bodies like planetesimals , asteroid - like and comet - like bodies .",
    "we suggest , with interstellar dust as the building blocks of the parent bodies , it is more reasonable to assume that the dust in the hr4796a disk is composed of amorphous silicate , amorphous carbon , and water ice .",
    "disk originates from the surface layers of planetesimals , possibly through excavating collisions ( j.h .",
    "debes , private coomunication ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the entire planetesimal need not be composed of tholins ; they might reside only on the surface where they are created and then be released .",
    "due to significant processing and possible alteration through planetesimal formation , the surface compositions of planetesimals in the @xmath0 disk may not resemble the ism composition .",
    "based on what we know from our own solar system , methane ice and water ice may reside on the surfaces of large planetesimals .",
    "these ices are exposed to the stellar uv flux and may ultimately produce tholin - like organic residues . ]    the model which best fits both the observed reflectance spectrum and the ir emission requires highly porous dust ( with @xmath62 which corresponds to @xmath55 if ice is sublimated ; see  2 ) . while it is natural to recognize that cold conglomeration of dust grains in molecular clouds can lead to highly porous dust structures , is expected for dust aggregates formed through coagulation as shown both theoretically ( cameron & schneck 1965 ; wada et al .",
    "2008 ) and experimentally ( blum et al .  2006 ) . ] at a first glance , it is harder to accept that comparatively more violent collisions between larger bodies would result in such a morphology in the resulting debris .",
    "to address this concern , we take the interplanetary dust particles ( idps ) as an analog for the dust in debris disks . the anhydrous chondritic idps collected in the stratosphere possibly of cometary origin",
    "show a highly porous structure ( brownlee 1987 ) . love et al .",
    "( 1994 ) have measured the densities of @xmath4150 unmelted chondritic idps with diameters of @xmath4515@xmath7 , using grain masses determined from an absolute x - ray analysis technique with a transmission electron microscope and grain volumes determined from scanning electron microscope imaging .",
    "they found that these particles have an average density of @xmath42.0@xmath81 , corresponding to a moderate porosity of @xmath40.4 .",
    "more recently , joswiak et al .  ( 2007 ) identified 12 porous cometary idps ( based on their atmospheric entry velocities ) with an average density of @xmath41.0@xmath81 , corresponding to @xmath82 .",
    "much higher porosities ( @xmath830.9 ) have been reported for some very fluffy idps ( e.g. mackinnon et al .  1987 , rietmeijer 1993 ) , despite that highly porous idps are probably too fragile to survive atmospheric entry heating .",
    "low densities are also derived for different groups of meteoroids@xmath84@xmath85 , which orbit the sun in interplanetary space .",
    "the atmospheric trajectories of meteors , i.e. the brightness generated by meteoroids passing through atmosphere , contain information about meteoroid orbits and densities .",
    "meteoroids are accordingly classified into groups with different orbits , structure and composition .",
    "the densities given above are valid for between @xmath450% and 73% of cometary meteor observations , depending on the observation method .",
    "the same studies show densities of @xmath42@xmath81 for the remaining cometary meteoroids , as well as for a significant part of the meteoroids ascribed to asteroids , which is also moderately porous ( see mann 2008 ) . ]",
    "ascribed to comets : the densities are @xmath41.0 , 0.75 , and 0.27@xmath81 , respectively ( ceplecha et al .  1998 ) , corresponding to a porosity of @xmath40.7 , 0.8 , and @xmath830.9 .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that the dust in the @xmath0 disk has a high porosity ( at least for those originated from cometary bodies ) .",
    "we are not sure about the relative contributions to the @xmath0 disk from asteroid collisions and cometary activity .",
    "note that this is a long - standing problem even for our own solar system ( e.g. see lisse 2002 ) .    to conclude",
    ", we argue that the presence of tholin - like complex organic materials in the @xmath0 disk is still not conclusive since the observed red spectral shape of the disk can be closely reproduced by models of porous dust comprised of common cosmic dust species .",
    "a more thorough study of the scattered light over a range of scattering angles would further constrain the optical properties of the dust .",
