    "through the note , we work over a ground field @xmath0 of characteristic zero . the moduli space @xmath1 of canonically polarized manifolds as well as its natural geometric compactification have attracted considerable interest over the past few decades .",

    "however , applying the git methods to construct a natural compactification is considerably more challenging in higher dimension than in dimension 1 ( see @xcite for some new difficulties arising ) . on the other hand , an alternative approach which uses the minimal model program ( mmp ) theory was first outlined in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "based on the recent progress in mmp , this strategy turns out to give a satisfying compacitification @xmath2 .",
    "although the coarse moduli space @xmath2 first only exists as an algebraic space , @xcite has developed a strategy to verify its projectivity , which was later completed in @xcite for the case of varieties and in @xcite for pairs .",
    "we can apply the knudson - mumford s determinant construction to the sequence of ample line bundles on @xmath3 constructed by kollr .",
    "the coefficient of the leading term is the cm line bundle ( see section [ ss - cm ] ) , which was first introduced in @xcite and later formulated in this way in @xcite .",
    "the curvature calculation on the weil - petersson metric of the cm line bundle suggests that it is ample .",
    "however , due to the presence of possibly singular fibers , this is only completely worked out for @xmath1 ( see @xcite ) .    in this note",
    "we give a purely algebraic proof of the fact that the cm line bundle is ample on @xmath3 .",
    "our approach is inspired by the recent interplay of studying @xmath3 from both the algebraic and differential geometry view points , especially the equivalence of ksba stability and k - stability for canonically polarized varieties ( see @xcite ) .",
    "[ thm - main ] the cm line bundle is ample on the ksba moduli space .    using the nakai - moishezon criterion and the formula of the cm line bundle for a family of ksba stable varieties",

    ", we want to remark that the positivity of the cm line bundle is expected for spaces parametrizing khler - einstein varieties or even polarized varieties with constant scalar curvature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "but in general , not much is known . in the case of the moduli space of khler - einstein fano varieties , it is still not known how to show the positivity of the cm line bundle with only algebro - geometric tools . using the fact that the curvature of the cm line bundle is the weil - petersson metric for a smooth family and some deep results in analysis , one can verify that it induces an embedding when restricting to the locus which parametrizes khler - einstein fano manfolds ( see @xcite ) .",
