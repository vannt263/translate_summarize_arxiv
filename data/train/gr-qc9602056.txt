    "<S> some recently discovered nonperturbative strong - field effects in tensor  scalar theories of gravitation are interpreted as a scalar analog of ferromagnetism : `` spontaneous scalarization '' . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon leads to very significant deviations from general relativity in conditions involving strong gravitational fields , notably binary - pulsar experiments . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to solar - system experiments , these deviations do not necessarily vanish when the weak - field scalar coupling tends to zero . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the scalar `` form factors '' measuring these deviations , and notably a parameter entering the pulsar timing observable @xmath0 through scalar - field - induced variations of the inertia moment of the pulsar . </S>",

    "<S> scalar theories and binary - pulsar experiments shows that nonperturbative scalar field effects are already very tightly constrained by published data on three binary - pulsar systems . </S>",
    "<S> we contrast the probing power of pulsar experiments with that of solar - system ones by plotting the regions they exclude in a generic two - dimensional plane of tensor  scalar theories .    </S>"
