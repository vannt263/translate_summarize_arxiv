    "the theory for first order hyperbolic systems , which was developed with fluid problems in mind , is by now rather well understood .",
    "it turned out that energy estimates via ` integration by parts ' and characteristics are the most important ingrediencies in the theory .",
    "second order hyperbolic systems often describe problems where wave propagation is dominant . in bounded domains this leads to a large number of boundary phenomena like glancing waves and surface waves .",
    "attempts have previously been made to write a second order system consisting of @xmath0 equations as a larger first order system .",
    "however , boundary phenomena such as glancing and surface waves correspond to generalized eigenvalues which are not handled by the theory for first order systems .",
    "furthermore , the resulting first order system often consists of more than @xmath1 equations which leads to many complications .",
    "in particular , the first order system must in general be augmented by side conditions to guarentee that solutions of the first order system satisfy the original second order system .    in this paper",
    "we describe a theory for second order hyperbolic systems based on laplace and fourier transform , with particular emphasis on boundary processes corresponding to generalized eigenvalues .",
    "our theory uses pseudo - differential operators combined with mode analysis , and builds upon the theory for first order systems developed in  @xcite .",
    "this approach has many desirable properties : 1 ) once a second order system has been laplace and fourier transformed it can always be written as a system of @xmath1 first order pseudo - differential equations .",
    "therefore , the theory of @xcite also applies here .",
    "2 ) we can localize the problem , i.e. , it is only necessary to study the cauchy problem and halfplane problems with constant coefficients .",
    "3 ) the class of problems we can treat is much larger than previous approaches based on `` integration by parts '' .",
    "4 ) the relation between boundary conditions and boundary phenomena becomes transparent .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_2 ] we state the general problem and provide some basic definitions . in section [ sec_3 ]",
    "we treat in detail the fundamental problem of a single wave equation in a half - plane subject to different types of boundary conditions . in section [ sec_4 ]",
    "we first study two wave equations coupled through the boundary conditions and then outline a theory for the general case of @xmath0 second order wave equations .",
    "this theory proves that all essential difficulties already occur for scalar wave equations coupled through the boundary conditions .",
    "numerical experiments are presented in section  [ sec_5 ] , where we study the different classes of boundary phenomena for two wave equations coupled through the boundary conditions .",
    "in this paper we want to consider second order systems which are of the form @xmath2 in the halfspace @xmath3 here @xmath4 where @xmath5 are @xmath6 constant matrices , @xmath7 is a vector valued function with @xmath0 components and we are using the notation @xmath8 at @xmath9 we give initial conditions by @xmath10 we are interested in smooth solutions which belong to @xmath11 and satisfy , at the boundary @xmath12 @xmath0 linearly independent boundary conditions . @xmath13 here @xmath14 are constant @xmath6 matrices , @xmath15 is non - sigular and , without loss of generality , we assume it to be normalised    [ assumption2.1.1 ] @xmath16    to facilitate the use of laplace transformation in time , we frequently assume that the initial data are homogeneous , i.e. , @xmath17 this is however no restriction , since it is always possible to change variables in a problem with general initial data such that the initial data becomes homogeneous in the new variable . since the cauchy problem is well posed ( see section [ sec_5 - 1 ] ) we can extend the definition of the forcing and the initial data smoothly to the whole of @xmath18 and determine its solution .",
    "then we subtract this solution from the halfplane problem and obtain a new halfplane problem where only the boundary data do not vanish .",
    "this is a very natural procedure because all the difficulties and many physical phenomena arise at the boundary .",
    "we now introduce some key definitions that classify the problems according to estimates one can achieve .",
