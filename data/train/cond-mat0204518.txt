    "a large number of proteins perform their biological activity under the shape of dimers ( or oligomers ) .",
    "a dimer is a protein whose native conformation is a globule build out of two disjoint chains .",
    "depending whether the two chains have the same sequence or not , they are referred to as homodimers or heterodimers .",
    "notwithstdanding this difference , they have been observed to fold through two major paradigms @xcite .",
    "some of the known dimers fold according to a three  state mechanism ( d@xmath0i@xmath0n ) , where first the denaturated chains of the monomers ( d ) assume conformations rich of native structures independently of each other ( i : folding intermediate ) , and subsequently the two parts come together to form the dimer ( n : native ) .",
    "this is the case , for example , of aspartate aminotransfease @xcite , where one can observe three populated species , namely unfolded monomers ( d ) , partially folded monomers ( i ) and folded dimers ( n ) .",
    "a different behaviour is displayed by , for example , p22 arc repressor @xcite , whose chains dimerize without populating any monomeric native  like intermediate ( two  state process , d@xmath0n ) . in this case",
    "one can only identify the unfolded monomers ( d ) and the native dimers ( n ) .",
    "the aim of the present work is to achieve , using model calculations , a basic understanding of the folding mechanism of dimers based solely on energetic arguments , as was already done in the case of small , single domain proteins ( monomers ) . in this case",
    ", it was found that good folders are those sequences whose total energy in the ground state conformation lies below a threshold value @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this threshold energy is solely determined by the number of amino acids forming the chain , the standard deviation of the contact energies used in designing the sequences and by their composition .",
    "it is equal to the lowest energy that random heteropolymers of the same length and composition can achieve when they compact into the ensemble of conformations structurally dissimilar ) of the similarity parameter ( order parameter ) @xmath2 , defined as the ratio between the number of native contacts present in the structure to which the sequence has compacted , and the total number of contacts of the native structure used to design the sequence . in the case of dimers , it is convenient to introduce two similarity ( order ) parameters for any given conformation , namely @xmath3 and @xmath4 which correspond to the relative value of native contacts within each chain and across the two chains , respectively . ] to the native conformation .    aside from being responsible for the thermodynamical uniqueness and stability of the ground state , the low  energy character of single domain good folders is also essential for their dynamics . the only way a small",
    ", single domain lattice designed protein can display an energy below @xmath1 is by positioning ( few ) strongly interacting amino acids in some key sites of the protein @xcite .",
    "these sites , called `` hot '' sites in ref . @xcite participate in the formation of local elementary structures ( les ) , which bias the chain to its native conformation @xcite and which build the ( post  critical ) folding nucleus when they get together , responsible not only for the stability of the protein@xcite , but also of its fast folding ability .",
    "amino acids in these sites are highly conserved in evolution @xcite and determine the topology of the space of folding sequences @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will characterize the dynamic behaviour of model homodimers with respect to the energetic properties of their ground state conformation . since a reliable potential function for residue ",
    "residue interaction is not available , we can compare the results of model calculations to real proteins only through the analysis of conservation patterns in families of analogous , measured as percentage of matching residues , are likely to be analogous @xcite . ]",
    "such an analysis has been performed for the analogs of aspartate aminotransfease and of p22 arc repressor , representative examples of a three  state and a two  state folding homodimer , respectively .",
    "the corresponding results are displayed in figs .",
    "[ arc ] and [ asp ] , and discussed in section v , where they are compared with the conservation patterns found in lattice model proteins .",
    "the model we use to study homodimers has been largely employed with success @xcite in the study of monomers .",
    "this is because , in spite of the strong simplifications introduced in the description of the proteins , aimed at making feasible dynamical simulations of the folding process , the model still contains the two main ingredients which are at the basis of the distinctive properties of proteins : polymeric structure and disordered interactions among the amino acids@xcite .",
    "the model is used to study the general thermodynamical and kinetical properties of notional dimers , independently on details concerning secondary structures , side chains , etc . of course , all these details may prove of relevance when addressing specific questions , as was e.g. done in refs .",
    "@xcite concerning the oligomerization equilibrium properties of leucine zippers .",
    "according to the model , a protein is a chain of beads on a cubic lattice , each bead representing an amino acid ( selected from twenty different types ) which interacts with its nearest neighbours through a contact potential with numbers taken from the statistical analisys of real proteins carried out by miyazawa and jernigan in ref .",
    "@xcite ( for details about the model see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the case of single domain proteins",
    "it is , in principle , simple to design sequences which fold to a given target conformation . due to the fact that the thermodynamical and kinetical behaviour of a protein are essentially determined by its total energy",
    ", it is possible to design folding sequences by searching in the space of sequences for those having energy lower than @xmath1 . using a monte carlo algorithm",
    ", a sequence with energy @xmath5 in the target conformation has a probability to be selected proportional to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is an intensive variable which plays the role of temperature and gives the degree of bias towards low  energy sequences . in the evolutionary context",
    ", @xmath7 has the meaning of selective pressure with respect to the protein ability to fold @xcite : the lower is the value of @xmath7 , the stronger is this pressure and the better are the folding properties of the selected sequences . in particular , for values of @xmath7 lower than the temperature @xmath8 ( which is the temperature at which the mean energy is exactly @xmath1 ) , the average energy of the selected sequences is lower than @xmath1 .",
    "consequently one obtains in this way sequences with a unique and stable native conformation and able to find it rapidly . in other words ,",
    "the designed sequences display a unique ground state ( native conformation ) with energy @xmath9 into which they fold fast @xcite .    in order to design homodimers",
    ", we first set a target conformation built out of two identical parts ( chosen equal to the native structure of a 36mer widely used in the literature in studies of small , single domain proteins @xcite ) , having a face in contact ( see fig .",
    "[ native ] ) . in the present model",
    "the monomers have been chosen to be mirror images of each other , consequently the overall structure is symmetrical with respect to the interface , a feature which simplifies the computational handling of the protein .",
    "the second step in the homodimer design is to choose a realistic ratio between the different kinds of amino acids@xcite and two evolutionary temperatures , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which control the amino acids in the bulk and at the interface , respectively .",
    "we then use a multicanonical sampling algorithm ( see appendix a ) to select a set of sequences @xmath12 , according to the distribution of probability @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the energies associated with the contacts between residues belonging to the same monomer and between residues across the interface , respectively , and @xmath16 is the partition function . during the sampling process , couples of residues belonging to one of the two monomers are swapped , the same swap being repeated on the other monomer , in such a way that the sequence remains identical in the two parts of the dimer . moreover , in this way the overall concentration of the different kinds of residues is kept constant .    starting from a random sequence displaying a realistic composition ( i.e. the average ratio of different kinds of amino acids as found in natural proteins @xcite ) , we make @xmath17 swappings , sufficient to ensure a stationary distribution of energy , before selecting a sequence , repeating this process @xmath18 times , to obtain a statistically representative set of designed sequences @xmath12 . consequently , in constructing this set we sample only @xmath19 sequences of the total of @xmath20 sequences . in keeping with the fact that each of the @xmath18 selected sequences are separated from each other by @xmath17 swappings , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath12 is a set of evolutionary uncorrelated sequences whose properties ( e.g. , conservation patterns ) can be compared to those of non  homologous sequences ( analogous ) families of real proteins .",
    "the use of two different temperatures @xmath10 and @xmath11 to select residues in the bulk and at the interface respectively , corresponding to two different evolutive pressures , allows one to control how the energy , and the amino acid conservation pattern , is distributed inside the dimer .",
    "details and caveats concerning the details and limitations of the design procedure are given in appendix b. examples of sequences selected at different evolutionary temperatures to fold to the structure displayed in fig .",
    "[ native ] are listed in table i.",
    "in the present and in the next sections we shall study the properties and the behaviour of the designed sequences in conformation space , making use of long monte carlo runs . in what follows we shall ( mainly ) concentrate on the thermodynamical properties of these sequences , while in sect .",
    "iv we dwell primarily on their dynamical behaviour .",
    "we first proceed to the calculation of the ground state energy of the designed sequences .",
    "because a complete enumeration of all possible homodimer conformations is out of question , the thermodynamical properties of the sequences selected at different values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( see e.g. table i ) are analyzed through a standard metropolis algorithm @xcite in the conformational space at fixed temperature @xmath21 ( temperature in `` real '' conformational space , not to be confused with the `` evolutionary '' temperatures @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the space of sequences ) .",
    "the simulations were performed with periodic boundary conditions , i.e. in a cubic wigner cell of dimension @xmath22 ( cf .",
    "the need for using a finite volume arises from the fact that , in an infinite volume each conformation with disjoint chains have an infinitely negative free energy , due to its infinite translational entropy , while that of the dimer is proportional to @xmath23 , @xmath24 being the volume allowed to the protein to move in . ] .",
    "long monte carlo simulations ( @xmath25 mc steps ) were performed for each pair of ( identical ) designed chains .",
    "two outcomes were observed : ( a ) folding into the dimeric native state , ( b ) aggregation into a set of disordered clumps . in what follows",
    "we shall only analyze the outcome ( a ) , while outcome ( b ) will be discussed in a forthcoming paper @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ dyn_phases ] we show the results obtained by carrying out the mc simulation at @xmath26 , for which the fractional population of the native state is @xmath27 .",
    "full simbols correspond to sequences displaying the behaviour ( a ) , while empty symbols correspond to sequences displaying the behaviour ( b ) .",
    "the solid line indicates the loci where the values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 correspond to the energy @xmath28 .",
    "we note that this line delimits the area in which the corresponding designed sequences display the behaviour of type ( a ) .",
    "this is not surprising , considering the fact that the lowest energy of a random conformation with the same number @xmath29 of contacts as the target conformation is @xmath30 ( evaluated in the approximation of the random energy model @xcite , @xmath31 being the standard deviation of the interaction matrix elements and @xmath32 the effective coordination number @xcite ) .",
    "as in the case of single domain proteins , conformations with energy lower than @xmath1 have not to compete with the sea of random structures , and consequently are good native conformations ( unique and stable ) in the native conformation ( i.e. @xmath33 , quantity closely connected with the z  score @xcite , and where @xmath34 is the standard deviation of the interaction matrix ) is actually more general @xcite . in fact , because these monomers fold through local elementary structures ( les ) stabilized by few ( hot ) , strongly interacting amino acids , and because these amino acids are conserved for all sequences with @xmath35 , one can restate the large energy gap paradigm of good folders as follows : sequences which display a very small number of hot amino acids and which conserve , in any way , the energy gap @xcite . ] .    in what follows",
    "we shall discuss , making again use of the results of long monte carlo runs and periodic boundary conditions because this was found the most appropriate from numerical considerations ( cf .",
    "c ) . ] , the properties of two of the sequences shown in table i , namely sequences @xmath36 and @xmath37 , chosen as representative examples of chains building homodimers which fold according to a two and to a three - state mechanism , respectively .",
    "they were both designed at low @xmath11 and @xmath10 , in the first case with @xmath38 and in the second case with @xmath39 . in both cases ,",
    "the designed sequences display a first ",
    "order transition in conformational space from the denaturated state into the native dimeric structure , as in the case of single domain proteins , as testified by the discontinuous behaviour of the similarity ( order ) parameters at the critical temperature @xmath40 .",
    "in other words , the order parameters @xmath2 display at @xmath41 a double peak behaviour .    as a rule , the critical temperatures @xmath42 and @xmath43 in conformational space will be different .",
    "in particular , in the case of sequence @xmath36 of table i , @xmath44 , in keeping with the fact that this sequence was designed setting @xmath10 larger than @xmath11 .",
    "this property has the consequence that the native state is stable at temperatures @xmath45 , @xmath42 being the critical temperature , at which the area of the peak associated to the unfolded state ( @xmath3 small ) is equal to that associated to the native state ( @xmath46 ) , and that dimerization happens already at @xmath47 .",
    "the fact that @xmath44 indicates that while it is possible to find a situation ( at @xmath21 such that @xmath48 ) in which the two chains build the native interface but the monomers are not folded ( cf .",
    "5(b ) ) , there is not a temperature at which the monomers are folded and separated ( cf .",
    "5(a ) ) .",
    "also sequence @xmath37 undergoes a first order transition , but in this case the critical temperature @xmath42 associated with the bulk is larger than that associated with the interface ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "this indicates that for sequences selected at comparatively high selective temperature @xmath11 ( @xmath50 , cf .",
    "table i ) , there exists a phase where the two chains are folded but separated ( cf .",
    "another interesting thermodynamical property of a dimer is the localization of the sites which are mostly responsible for the stabilization of the native state .",
    "these sites can be identified by the change in energy @xmath51 that mutations induce in the native conformation @xcite . for a given site @xmath52 ,",
    "19 mutations can be carried out . because @xmath53 may change markedly depending on the point mutation introduced in the protein , it is useful to define the average value @xmath54 taken over all possible substitutions . in keeping with the result of studies of single domain protein @xcite , in particular of the sequence @xmath55 of table i , `` hot '' sites ( sites which are most sensitive to point mutations , which as a rule , if mutated , denaturate the protein ) are those sites for which @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the average value of @xmath54 ( @xmath58 ) taken over all the sites of the chain , while @xmath34 is the associated standard deviation .",
    "`` cold '' and `` warm '' sites in the nomenclature of ref .",
    "@xcite are those sites for which @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively for the case of s@xmath61 , i.e. @xmath62 ( cold ) , @xmath63 ( warm ) , @xmath64 ( hot ) , in keeping with the fact that , in this case , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . ] .    in fig .",
    "7 we display the values of @xmath54 associated with sequence @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath67 and @xmath55 ( s@xmath61 monomer ) of table i. a marked difference in the pattern distribution of hot and warm sites associated with sequence @xmath36 ( two  state folding ) and @xmath37 ( three - state folding ) is observed .",
    "in fact , sequence @xmath36 ( fig .",
    "7(a ) ) displays no hot sites and double as many warm sites than sequence @xmath37 ( fig .",
    "7(b ) ) , the properties of the sites of this last chain in the native conformation being essentially those found in the study of the isolated monomer s@xmath61 ( fig .",
    "7(d ) , cf . also @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the amino acids occupying the warm sites of chain @xmath36 are , in average , more strongly interacting ( 2.4 ) than those associated with the warm sites of chain @xmath37 ( 1.9 ) , althoug still much less than hot sites of this chain ( 3.1 ) .",
    "in other words , in sequence @xmath37 most of the binding energy is concentrated in few `` hot '' sites , while in the case of sequence @xmath36 the stabilization energy is spread more homogeneously throughout the monomers .",
    "we now concentrate our attention , making again use of the results of the monte carlo simulations already discussed in the last section , on the dynamics of the process that leads the system from a random conformation to the native dimer ( for details and caveats see appendix b ) . the first issue to assess",
    "is whether the dimeric native state is accessible on a short time scale ( short with respect to the random search time , @xmath68 mc steps ) . for each of the sequences selected at various evolutionary temperatures ( some of them being listed in table i ) ,",
    "20 simulations of @xmath69 mc steps have been performed , recording the first passage time , i.e. the folding time @xmath70 ( cf . table",
    "ii ) into the dimeric native conformation .",
    "each set of simulations has been repeated at three temperatures , @xmath26 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we shall first discuss the case of sequences optimized at very low values of both @xmath10 and @xmath11 and with @xmath38 , so that the interface energy is close to its global minimum ( solid squares in fig .",
    "[ dyn_phases ] ) .",
    "this design procedure was followed in the expectation to obtain sequences which fold through a two  state process , namely first dimerization and then folding . to check this scenario , we have determined through dynamical mc simulations the distribution of @xmath3 ( and @xmath4 ) associated with sequence of type @xmath36 ( cf .",
    "table i ) , and calculated at the instant in which @xmath4 ( or @xmath3 ) reach , for the first time , a value of the order of one and @xmath4 vary discontinuously as a function of the number of mc steps , we have used the mc step at which a value of @xmath3 or @xmath4 larger than @xmath73 is reached for the first time to define the instant at which to calculate the value of the other order parameter ( and thus the associated distribution ) @xmath74 or @xmath75 respectively . ] .",
    "the results displayed in fig .",
    "8(a ) show that , by the time the bulk of the two chains fold , @xmath4 is essentially equal to 1 , indicating that the interface between the two chains is already in place . on the other hand , at the time in which @xmath4 acquires for the first time a value @xmath76 , @xmath3 displays a rather flat distribution , its average value being @xmath77 .",
    "one can conclude that sequence @xmath78 of table i first dimerizes and then folds .    the fact that in the present case the folding time @xmath79 increases with temperature ( cf .",
    "table ii ) indicates that the dimerization process is not diffusion limited .",
    "that is , @xmath79 is determined not only by the time needed by the two interfaces to come in contact , but also by the stability of the interface structure . in first approximation ,",
    "the diffusion time @xmath80 for the interfaces to meet , in the approximation that two interfaces search for each other randomly in the space of configurations , is @xmath81 steps , where 6 is the number of faces of an ideal cubic conformation , 4 takes into account the rotational symmetries of the faces and @xmath82 is the volume of the system .",
    "this time is much shorter than the folding time . on the other hand , at @xmath71",
    "the relative population of an isolated fragment containing the 12 interface residues in place ( forming the surface of one of the two monomers ) has been calculated to be @xmath83 ( determined through a mc simulation ) , so that the probability to have the two interfaces structured at the same time is @xmath84 .",
    "consequently , in this simple model , the folding time is predicted to be @xmath85 , which agrees well with the value found in detailed mc simulations and displayed in table ii .",
    "this picture explains also the increase of aggregation probability with temperature .",
    "in fact , the higher is the temperature , the longer is the time that partially structured surfaces which eventually dimerize move around in configurational space and can bind to wrong partners , causing aggregation .",
    "also the behaviour of unfolding times agrees with the picture of folding  after ",
    "in fact , starting from the native conformation , the average decay of @xmath4 with respect to time is ( cf .",
    "[ unfold ] ) @xmath86 at @xmath71 ( the values for other temperatures are listed in table ii ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath3 is best fitted by a stretched exponential in the form @xmath87 , with @xmath88 and @xmath89 , the average time being @xmath90 .",
    "the fact that @xmath91 does not follow an exponential law indicates that the unfolding of each of the two chains is not a process which depends only on its internal ( intra monomer ) contacts , like e.g. in the case of single domain proteins , cf .",
    "@xcite , but is subordinated to an external event . in keeping with this fact , and because the detaching time @xmath92 ( the characteristic decay time of @xmath4 ) is shorter than @xmath93 , one can conclude that the breaking of the native bonds associated with the internal structure of the two chains is a consequence of their detaching or , in other words , that the stability of the monomer structures relies on the presence of the interface .",
    "we now turn our attention to the sequences selected at @xmath94 in order to be close to the global minimum of the bulk energy ( @xmath95 ) and corresponding to the solid triangles in fig . [ dyn_phases ] .",
    "sequence @xmath96 of table i is an example of this class of designed homodimers .",
    "the dynamical behaviour of this sequence is quite different from that of sequence @xmath36 , although at @xmath71 it folds with probability @xmath77 to its native conformation , in an average time ( first passage time ( fpt ) ) of @xmath97 ( cf .",
    "table iii ) mc steps , quantities which is quite similar to those associated with sequence @xmath78 ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 mc steps , respectively ) .",
    "the analysis of the time dependence of @xmath91 and @xmath100 shows ( cf .",
    "8(b ) ) that for sequence @xmath37 @xmath4 is very small at the time in which @xmath101 , while at the time at which @xmath102 , @xmath3 is already essentially equal to 1 , indicating a three  state scenario and the esistence of an intermediate state where the two monomers are folded and not dimerized .",
    "that is , sequence @xmath96 first fold to its monomeric native conformation and then forms the dimer .    in the folding process , this sequence follows the hierarchical path typical of monomeric model proteins @xcite , building first local elementary structures ( les ) , then the ( postcritical ) folding nucleus , finding the monomeric native conformation shortly after .",
    "in addition , in the present case , there is a further step which consists in the association of the two monomers to build the dimer ( to be noted that sequence @xmath96 has the same local elementary structures and folding core than the monomeric protein studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , as testified by the fact that the hot sites are essentially the same ( cf . figs .",
    "7(b ) and ( d ) ) ) .    the same sequence , when studied as an isolated chain at the same temperature , folds in an average time of @xmath103 steps , indicating that the time limiting step is the association ( it takes @xmath104 steps ) .",
    "as temperature increases , the folding time decreases slightly ( see table iii ) .",
    "this decrease is much less pronounced than the decrease in the diffusion time as measured by the inverse of the diffusion coefficient @xmath105 ( which is exponential with temperature , see third column in table iii ) , indicating that the dimerization time is not purely diffusion limited . on the contrary",
    ", the stability of the interface ( which depends exponentially on temperature as well ) plays an important role in the dimerization time .    to check the generality of the results discussed above",
    ", we have repeated the design and the folding for another three dimensional conformation , where the native structure of each of the monomers is the same , but the interface involves the opposite face than in the case of the dimeric conformation shown in fig .",
    "while the folding time of sequences which first fold and then aggregate is similar to that of sequence @xmath37 , the folding time for sequences behaving according to a two  state mechanism is substantially higher ( of the order of @xmath106 mc steps ) .",
    "this is due to the much lower stability of the interface built out of the two , rather unspecific surfaces stabilized by the contacts between residues lying rather distant from each other along the chain ( e.g. 1932 , 1732 ) , while in the previous case the surfaces were pieces of incipient @xmath107sheets stabilized by quartets of residues ( e.g. 36 , 710 ) .",
    "nonetheless , also in this case it is possible to find sequences which fold according to the two paradigms discussed above .",
    "summing up , it is found that if the folding of the homodimer is controlled by stable les ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) stabilized by few hot , strongly interacting amino acids , the folding time decreases with temperatures , as the folding of the protein is ( post  critical ) folding  nucleus ",
    "formation controlled . in fact , the folding nucleus is the result of the docking of the les in the appropriate way , and thus controlled by the diffusion time of the les , a process which is speed up by increasing the temperature .",
    "this happens until one reaches a temperature at which the stability of les is affected , beyond which the folding time rises again .",
    "since the stabilization energy of les is much larger than the interaction energy between pairs of amino acids @xcite , there exists a large window of temperatures at which folding time is short .",
    "this scenario reflects , to a large extent , the temperature dependence of the folding time of monomers of which the homodimer is made of ( cf .",
    "the situation is quite different in the case of a dimer built out of two sequences of type @xmath36 , which first dimerize and then fold ( two  state process ) . in this case , the folding of the system is not controlled by les .",
    "this is because , were one to put `` hot '' amino acids ( needed to stabilize the les ) on the surfaces which dimerize , these surfaces will be so reactive that the system will aggregate with high probability ( open circles in the low@xmath11 region of fig .",
    "but if the dimerizing surfaces do not contain `` hot '' amino acids , the folding of the remaining amino acids ( `` volume '' ) can not depend on les either , otherwise the system will behave more like sequences of type @xmath37 . consequently ,",
    "if both the dimerizing surfaces and the remaining part of the ( `` volume '' ) system are marginally stable , the binding energy being essentially uniformly distributed among all the pairs of nearest neighbours amino acids ( low @xmath108values associated essentially with all sites ) , the fast folding temperature window is expected to be much narrower than in the case of homodimer based on sequence of type @xmath37 .",
    "in fact , already at low temperature ( @xmath26 ) , the system based on sequences of type @xmath36 is found to be passed the minimum of the curve shown in fig .",
    "10 , and one observes an increase of the folding time as a function of @xmath21 ( cf . table ii ) .",
    "a possible connection between the model of homodimer folding discussed above and real proteins can be achieved by studying the degree of amino acid conservation in each site of analogous dimers .",
    "this can be done by calculating the entropy in the space of sequences in each site , given by @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the probability of finding the amino acid of kind @xmath34 at site @xmath52 , a probability to be calculated over a large number of sequences folding to the same conformation .    within the present model ,",
    "the calculation of @xmath111 is straightforward . given a dimeric native conformation ( fig .",
    "[ native ] ) , and a couple of evolutionary temperatures @xmath10 and @xmath11 , one selects from the corresponding set of designed sequences a representative sample ( e.g. @xmath18 ) of them . since these sequences are aligned , it is possible to calculate the associated values of @xmath110 and , consequently , @xmath111 .",
    "the entropy at each site ranges from @xmath112 , if only one kind of amino acids occupies that site in all sequences selected , to @xmath113 , if each kind of amino acid is equiprobable , the latter being the case at large values of the design temperature .",
    "we have shown elsewhere @xcite that , for monomeric proteins , low ",
    "entropy sites are those where most of the stabilization energy is concentrated .",
    "the search of low ",
    "entropy sites rather than of strongly  interacting sites has the advantage that it can be easily performed for real proteins , for which a reliable energy function is not available .    in figs .",
    "11 and 12 we display the entropy per site and the associated distribution of entropy for : ( a ) sequences displaying the folding behaviour of sequence @xmath36 ( solid squares in fig .",
    "4 ) , ( b ) for sequences displaying the folding behaviour of sequence @xmath37 ( solid triangles in fig .",

    "3 ( sequence @xmath55 of table i ) .    one observes a marked difference between the entropy per site shown in fig .",
    "11(a ) and that displayed in fig .",
    "in fact , sequences of type @xmath36 have many more conserved sites than sequences of type @xmath37 ( the ratio between these two numbers being 3.3 ) , the average entropy being a factor of 1.6 larger than that associated with sequences of type @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , in the case of sequence @xmath37 only @xmath114 of the conserved sites lie on the surface , while in the case of sequence @xmath36 this ratio is @xmath115 . on the other hand , cases ( a ) and ( b ) can not be distinguished by looking at the interface / bulk average entropy , being 1.42 and 1.43 respectively in the case of sequence of type @xmath36 and 1.17 and 1.24 in the case of sequences of type @xmath37",
    "the situation is similar if one looks at the values of the average entropy associated with conserved sites lying on the interface ( @xmath116 ) as compared to the average entropy @xmath117 associated with all conserved sites ( cf .",
    "table iv ) .    for aggregating sequences ( empty circles in fig .",
    "4 , see fig .",
    "11(c ) ) , there is an evident difference between the entropy of the interface ( sites 112 ) , whose average entropy is 1.18 , and the bulk , whose average entropy is 1.71 .",
    "aggregation arises due to the fact that the surface , which essentially contains all of the `` hot '' sites of the protein ( @xmath118 of them ) , is too reactive .    summing up",
    ", sequences of type @xmath36 give rise to a dimer where the conservation pattern is distributed much more uniformly among all sites and where there are quite a large number of important sites although much less conserved than the few hot sites of sequences of type @xmath37 .",
    "these results indicate that , from the conservation patterns of lattice designed sequences , it is possible to recognize sequences which aggregate from those which dimerize . among these we can recognize sequences which dimerize through a three  state scenario or through a two  state mechanism by looking at the overall distribution of entropy , but not at the difference between the entropy of the interface and of the bulk .",
    "these results agree with the findings by grishin and phillips , which analyze the conservation of residues on the surface of five oligomeric enzymes and find no signal of any larger conservationism on the interface with respect to the bulk @xcite .",
    "we suggest that one has to analyze the distribution of entropy , not the bulk / interface partition , to derive the behaviour of a family of sequences .    to test the predictions of the model",
    ", we have calculated the entropy at each site for two dimeric proteins , i.e. p22 arc repressor and aspartate aminotransfease ( cf . figs .",
    "[ arc ] and [ asp ] ) . the former folds according to the paradigm of sequence @xmath36 of table i ( first dimerize and then fold ) , while the latter follows the opposite scenario ( the monomers first fold and then dimerize ) . from the fssp database",
    "we have selected , for each of the two proteins , a family of non  homologous aligned sequences which have the same fold and the same interface ( z  score larger than 2 ) , and from them we have calculated @xmath111 . the entropy was calculated in three different ways , in order to take care of the gaps in the alignment .",
    "the results indicated in figs .",
    "1 and 2 in terms of solid lines were obtained considering the positions in the gaps as filled by a kind of amino acid which is , by definition , different from all others ( including the other `` fake '' amino acids put in the gaps of the other sequences ) .",
    "dots indicate a calculations where amino acids are grouped into six classes ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite ) , while the dotted line is calculated ignoring sequences which , at a given site , display a gap . below the x ",
    "axis it is displayed , with a black stripe , the interface region .",
    "the relative number of conserved sites is considerably larger ( a factor 2.7 , cf .",
    "table iv ) in the case of p22 arc repressor than in the case of aspartate aminotransfease . of them , only @xmath114 lie on the interface of aspartate aminotransfease while @xmath119 does in the case of the two  state p22 arc repressor .",
    "further confrontation between the results of lattice model calculations and real proteins can be carried out through the entropy distributions associated with fig .",
    "11 ( designed proteins ) and figs . 1 and 2 ( p22 arc repressor and aspartate aminotransfease ) , as displayed in figs . 12 and 13 , respectively .",
    "the arc repressor distribution displays an abrupt increase of the entropy at a value somewhat larger than 1 which is the edge of a well defined peak , a behaviour which is very similar to that of sequences of kind @xmath36 shown in fig .",
    "12(a ) . on the other hand , aspartate aminotransfease displays a gradual increase in the distribution of entropy , and a two peak structure , which resembles the corresponding quantity associated with sequences of type @xmath37 ( cf .",
    "12(b ) ) , having few sites which are highly conserved . these results , as well as those displayed in table iv ,",
    "thus seem to confirm the overall picture emerging from lattice model calculations .",
    "we conclude this section by recalling the fact that the data used to derive the numbers displayed in figs . 1 and 2 ( 6 and 11 sequences respectively )",
    "have rather poor statistics , because not many analogous sequences with the same interface are available in the pdb .",
    "another caveat to be used in comparing the data with the model calculations is the fact that real proteins aside from structural features , display functional properties ( not present in model calculations ) , which can have conditioned the conservation of amino acids at precise sites , in particular surface and interface sites .",
    "in the present paper we have designed , with the help of a lattice model , sequences which either first dimerize and then fold or , conversely , first fold and then dimerize .",
    "they were obtained by minimizing their energy in a given ( dimeric ) conformation with respect to amino acid sequence at constant composition .",
    "the swapping of amino acids was carried out making use of monte carlo techniques .",
    "two design temperatures have been used to carry out the minimization process , one controlling the evolutionary pressure on the interface amino acids , the other controlling the pressure on the amino acids occupying the bulk of the dimer .",
    "we know that the way evolution solves the protein folding problem of small monoglobular systems , at least within lattice models , is by asigning the commanding role of the process to few , hot , highly conserved amino acids ( low entropy `` bump '' of fig .",
    "12(d ) ) . for the remaining amino acids one can essentially choose anyone among the twenty different types .",
    "in fact , we know @xcite that there are @xmath120 sequences sharing the same `` hot '' amino acids which fold to the native structure on which the monomeric sequence s@xmath61 ( sequence @xmath55 , table i ) was designed ( high entropy peak of fig .",
    "12(d ) ) .    the further requirement of dimerization after folding",
    ", typical of sequences of type @xmath37 , seems to be solved by evolution through an increase in the number of commanding amino acids , that is , by increasing the number of highly conserved , low entropy monomers . in other words , by shifting amino acid ( sites ) from the high  s peak of fig .",
    "12(d ) into the low  s peak of the same figure , as testified by the entropy distribution associated with sequences of type @xmath37 shown in fig .",
    "12(b ) ( cf . also figs .",
    "7(b ) and 7(d ) ) .",
    "this change in the strategy of evolution is complete in the case of sequences of type @xmath36 , which first dimerize and then fold . in this case , all amino acids become essentially equally conserved , the small high  s peak of fig .",
    "12(b ) being absorbed in the long tail of the single peak of fig .",
    "this is consistent with the low @xmath108values observed for the transition state of p22 arc repressor @xcite .    from these results",
    "one can conclude that sequences which first dimerize and then fold must be much more difficult to come about than sequences that first fold and then dimerize , in keeping with the fact that the first type of sequences are dependent on a significantly larger set of conserved amino acids to reach the protein native structure in the folding process , than the second type of proteins .",
    "the unusual feature of the present design process is the fact that it requires different average energies for the bulk and for the interface . as a consequence ,",
    "it is not possible to apply standard equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "anyway , one can still proceed in parallel with the canonical ensemble picture and regard the system as composed of two interacting parts , each of them in contact with its own thermal bath . of",
    "course we are not interested in the true equilibrium of the system , which would require the two baths to reach the same temperature and the same average energy , but in a stationary state in which the average energies are constant .",
    "if we call @xmath121 a generic distribution of states of the system , we can define the average energy functional @xmath122=\\sum h_1 p$ ] and @xmath123=\\sum h_2 p$ ] of the two parts of the system and the entropy functional @xmath124=-\\sum p\\log p$ ] , which indicates the information we have about the system .    among all possible distributions @xmath121",
    ", we are interested in the stationary distribution @xmath125 which minimizes the information ( maximizing @xmath126 ) at fixed @xmath122=e_1^*$ ] and @xmath123=e_2^*$ ] . in keeping also with the constrain @xmath127",
    ", one finds the distribution @xmath128 where @xmath129 normalizes the probability to unity and @xmath130 and @xmath107 are the lagrange multipliers which set the average energies . to evaluate them ,",
    "we can write the entropy @xmath131 $ ] as a function of the energies @xmath132 .",
    "its derivatives in @xmath133 and @xmath134 give @xmath135 in parallel with equilibrium thermodynamics , we call temperatures the inverse of the two lagrange multipliers , @xmath136 and @xmath137 .    to select sequences @xmath12 distributed according to @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are the bulk and the interface energy of the sequence , respectively , and @xmath141 , we use a multicanonical technique ( see appendix b ) .    the multicanonical method @xcite is an extension of the usual monte carlo sampling method . in the latter the phase space of a generic system kept at temperature @xmath21 is sampled making trial random moves ( here , amino acid swappings ) and accepting the move with a probability @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the equilibrium statistical weight of a given state of the system , which is of course the boltzman distribution @xmath144 .",
    "this works efficiently at high temperatures , but becomes problematic when @xmath21 is decresed , due to the fact that the system can get trapped in local energy minima . to overcome this problem",
    ", the multicanonical method samples the phase space using unconventional statistical weigths , namely @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the energetic degeneracy of that state .",
    "coarse graining the description of the system , each state can be labelled with its energy and the statistical weight associated with a given energy is @xmath147 . in other words",
    ", we are sampling a phase space which ( using these artificial weights ) is flat , so that the system can not get trapped in metastable states .",
    "the problem is that @xmath148 , which defines the weights , is not known _",
    "a priori_. the algorithm has to be , accordingly , self  consistent : a trial @xmath148 is guessed , the phase space is sampled with weights @xmath149 , from the results of the sampling a new distribution @xmath148 , and so on .",
    "when @xmath148 has converged , one has found the distribution of energies of the system ( which does not depend on the weights used to find it ! ) and from this derive all the other thermodynamical quantities of the system .",
    "the algorithm is computationally requiring , also because at each autoconsistent step the information found in the preceding steps , save the last , is discareded . to solve this problem a very efficient method , which combines the informations found during the whole calculation , has be developed by borg and described extensively in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the sampling of the space of sequences",
    "we have used the multicanonical algorithm and checked the results with the extension of ref .",
    "strictly speaking , the monte carlo algorithm was designed to study equilibrium properties of systems with many degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it has been shown @xcite that , being equivalent to solving the fokker ",
    "planck equation for diffusion in a potential , it can be helpful also in studying the kinetical properties of complex systems , provided that the fokker ",
    "planck approximation is valid ( i.e. , moves are local and the potential changes smoothly on the diffusionlenght scale ) .",
    "furthermore , rey and skolnick have shown @xcite that the folding trajectories obtained for single domain proteins with monte carlo simulations are consistent with those obtained with real molecular dynamics calculations .    in the study of dimers",
    "there is an additional problem .",
    "since the monte carlo moves are local , it is not evident that this algorithm describes properly the diffusion of one chain with respect to the other . to make sure that the present algorithm is suitable to deal with diffusion , we have simulated the displacement of the center of mass of single monomer heteropolymers . in fig . [ com1 ]",
    "it is displayed the mean square displacement of the center of mass @xmath150 as a function of time for five sequences designed , to different degrees , to fold to the same conformation .",
    "it is also displayed the behaviour of a random sequence ( the first to the left ) .",
    "the calculations are performed at the temperature @xmath71 and the average is done over 50 independent runs , each time starting from a random conformation .",
    "all these sequences move in a diffusive regime , characterized by @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is time ( measured as number of mc steps ) and @xmath153 is the diffusion coefficient .    in the inset",
    "we show the diffusion coefficient @xmath153 of each sequence ( in units of @xmath154 lattice units over number of mc steps ) with respect to its native energy ( on the horizontal axis is the energy @xmath155 ) .",
    "it is clear from this plot that the diffusion coefficient depends on the stability of the protein , a feature which is rather unphysical since it should only depend on the shape of the polymer and on the properties of the solvent . on the other hand",
    ", one can notice that for optimized sequences ( @xmath156 ) @xmath153 decreases linearly with the energy , spanning a range @xmath157 per unit energy .",
    "consequently , we expect that the effects of this dependence on the folding mechanism of optimized sequences are negligible .",
    "the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on temperature for a fixed sequence ( e.g. @xmath78 of table i ) is displayed in fig .",
    "[ com2 ] . except for low temperatures ( @xmath158 )",
    "it satisfies einstein s equation @xmath159 , where @xmath57 is the mobility of the chain , indicating that that chain undergoes brownian motion .",
    "the choice of the linear dimension @xmath22 of the wigner cell where the monte carlo simulations were carried out was found to be important in determining the dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "this quantity is the model parameter which reflects the density @xmath160 of sequences in real systems , either the cell or a test tube , which eventually fold in the native conformation of the designed homodimer .",
    "if @xmath161 , we found that the chains get entangled in some non  native conformations , since there is not enough room for them to assume the native conformation ( which is a parallelepiped of @xmath162 ) . if @xmath163 the translational entropy of the disjoint chains is so large that the conformation corresponding to the two chains folded and separated becomes the equilibrium state .",
    "in other words , although the two chain system is able to reach the native homodimer conformation , it is very unstable ( e.g. , the relative population of the homodimer native conformation is , for sequence @xmath36 at @xmath71 and @xmath164 , less than @xmath165 ) . in what follows we shall set ] @xmath164 , even if with this choice , the system experiences some difficulties in reaching the native conformation , due to the narrowness of the space available .",
    "for example , in 20 long mc runs ( @xmath25 mc steps ) , sequence @xmath36 can find its correct dimeric native state in 16 times out of 20 .",
    "in fact , in 4 cases it finds a conformation with energy @xmath166 , corresponding to a situation in which one of the two chains ( let us call them a and b ) is folded ( say , chain a ) , the monomers of chain b at the interface being in their native position , while chain b is in a ( well defined ) conformation which has only @xmath115 similarity with its native structure ( similarity parameter @xmath167 ) .",
    "the reason for this result is to be found in the fact that chain b builds some contacts with the `` back '' of chain a , taking advantage of the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "these contacts are mostly between residues of chain b and partners which are of the right kind but belong to the wrong chain ( contacts 17a32b , 23a18b , 24a17b , 25a36b , 26a35b , 35a26b ) , while two of them are between monomers which can not be in contact if they belong to the same chain ( 31a32b , 32a33b ) .",
    "while these processes may be of relevance , for example , in connection with the formation of amyloid aggregates , it arises in the present work due to an artifact of the model .",
    "in fact , it is connected with the fact that we are simulating a system of many chains by considering explicitely only two of them with periodic boundary conditions . as a consequence , a domain  swapping  like mechanism @xcite is likely to take place .",
    "in fact , if after the two chains have built the native interface , a subdomain of one of the two sequences is not in place but moves around , it can find itself in the vicinity of its complement , but belonging to the other chain . we shall come back to phenomena of domain  swapping @xcite in a future publication , where we shall consider more than two chains @xcite .    .in",
    "rows 25 we display examples of one of the two identical sequences designed , making use of the dimer native conformation displayed in fig .",
    "3 and of the 20@xmath16820 contact energy matrix of ref .",
    "[ 24 ] ( table vi ) , at different evolutionary temperatures @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the energy @xmath169 is associated with the bulk contacts of one of the two monomers , so that the total energy in the native conformation is @xmath170 , @xmath171 being the energy associated with the contacts across the interface .",
    "as indicated , sequences @xmath36 and @xmath172 display a two  state dimerization , while sequences @xmath37 and @xmath173 fold through a three - state mechanism . on the other hand , sequence @xmath67 aggregates . also displayed",
    "is the threshold energy @xmath1 , as well as the normalized gap @xmath174 , where @xmath34 ( @xmath175 ) is the standared deviation of the contact energies ( cf . also footnote number 6 ) . in the last row ( number 6 )",
