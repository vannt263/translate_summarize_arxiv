    "contact structures arise in the context of hamiltonian dynamics via the notion of _ convexity _ : a convex hypersurface in a symplectic manifold naturally inherits a contact structure , and the orbits of its reeb vector field then match the hamiltonian orbits defined by any hamiltonian function that has the hypersurface as a regular level set . in this paper , we consider contact structures that are induced on convex and concave _ boundaries _ of symplectic manifolds , i.e.  symplectic cobordisms .",

    "the prototype for theorems  [ thm : main ] and  [ thm : nonprime ] is a 20-year - old result of hofer - wysocki - zehnder @xcite , which amounts to the case @xmath19 of theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "the result in @xcite was in some sense far ahead of its time , as it required ideas from both the compactness theory @xcite and the intersection theory @xcite of punctured holomorphic curves , but it appeared several years before either of those theories were developed in earnest . in the mean time",

    "recently , murphy and siegel @xcite have also found examples of nonflexible weinstein subdomains in the standard ball , whose boundaries therefore also satisfy the hypothesis of theorem  [ thm : alldimensions ] .",
    "it is not known whether any contact @xmath0-manifolds satisfy the hypothesis of theorem  [ thm : nonprime ] without being overtwisted , though andy wand @xcite has proved that the answer is no under the stronger condition that the cobordism is stein .",
    "theorem  [ thm : nonprime ] may thus be interpreted as a small measure of support for the conjecture that wand s theorem extends to liouville cobordisms ( cf .",
    "@xcite*question  5 ) .",
    "we remark that the word `` liouville '' definitely can not be dropped from the statements of any of the above theorems : for instance , any lagrangian torus in the standard symplectic @xmath45 gives rise to a strong symplectic cobordism from the unit cotangent bundle of the torus to @xmath21 , but one can easily find contact forms on the former that have no contractible reeb orbits , corresponding to metrics on the torus with no contractible geodesics .",
    "the cobordism of course can not be liouville because , by a well - known theorem of gromov @xcite , the lagrangian torus can not be exact .",
    "similarly , @xcite and @xcite show that every contact @xmath0-manifold with positive giroux torsion is symplectically cobordant to something overtwisted , including e.g.  the nonfillable tight @xmath0-tori , which admit contact forms without contractible orbits .",
    "here is a specific situation in which theorem  [ thm : main ] can be used to rule out the existence of exact symplectic cobordisms .",
    "good candidates for manifolds that fail to satisfy the conclusion of the theorem are furnished by the universally tight lens spaces @xmath46 for @xmath47 . recall that @xmath46 is defined as the quotient @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the cyclic group of matrices @xmath50 for @xmath51 , acting on the unit sphere @xmath52 by unitary transformations .",
    "this action preserves the standard contact form @xmath53 on  @xmath23 , written here in coordinates @xmath54 , so the standard contact structure @xmath55 on @xmath46 is defined via this quotient .",
    "[ prop : lens ] for every relatively prime pair of integers @xmath56 , @xmath46 admits a nondegenerate contact form with only two simple closed reeb orbits , both of them nondegenerate and noncontractible .",
    "we present @xmath57 as a quotient of the so - called _ irrational ellipsoid_. let @xmath58 on @xmath23 , where @xmath59 is the restriction to the unit sphere @xmath52 of the function @xmath60 for some @xmath61 .",
    "the closed orbits for the reeb flow on @xmath23 determined by @xmath62 are then in bijective correspondence with the closed orbits on the ellipsoid @xmath63 for the hamiltonian flow of @xmath59 on the standard symplectic  @xmath64 . in particular , if @xmath65 is irrational , then the only simple closed orbits of this flow are ( up to parametrization ) the embedded loops @xmath66 defined by @xmath67 for @xmath68 , and moreover , these orbits and their multiple covers are all nondegenerate .",
    "now since @xmath69 and @xmath59 are both invariant under the action of @xmath70 , which contains @xmath71 , @xmath62 descends to a well - defined contact form on @xmath46 , and this contact form is nondegenerate .",
    "but the orbits @xmath72 and @xmath73 project to orbits in @xmath46 that are @xmath74-fold covered , so their underlying simple orbits lift to the universal cover @xmath75 as non - closed paths since @xmath76 , hence they are noncontractible .    for every pair of relatively prime integers @xmath56 , @xmath77 admits no exact cobordism to @xmath6 .",
    "the reeb flow on any universally tight @xmath46 admits a contractible reeb orbit since @xmath78 is torsion , so previously known criteria for excluding such cobordisms do not apply .",
    "while the lens space example is relatively easy to work with , the nondegeneracy of a contact form is usually a rather difficult condition to check , and for this reason one might sometimes want to have the following technical enhancement of theorems  [ thm : main ] and  [ thm : nonprime ] .",
    "it will be an immediate consequence of our proofs , requiring only that one pay closer attention to the relationship between periods of orbits and energies of holomorphic curves .",
    "[ thm : technical ] assume @xmath5 satisfies the hypotheses of either theorem  [ thm : main ] or theorem  [ thm : nonprime ] , and fix a contact form @xmath79 for @xmath5 .",
    "there exists a constant @xmath80 , dependent on  @xmath79 , such that the following holds : suppose @xmath81 is a contact form on @xmath5 such that    1 .",
    "@xmath82 satisfies @xmath83 , and 2 .",
    "all closed reeb orbits for @xmath7 with period less than @xmath84 are nondegenerate .",
    "then the reeb flow of @xmath7 satisfies the conclusions of theorems  [ thm : main ] or  [ thm : nonprime ] respectively , and the unknotted orbit can be assumed to have period less than  @xmath84 .",
    "one could apply this in practice if e.g.  @xmath79 is morse - bott and admits no unknotted reeb orbits , as then one can define perturbations of @xmath79 as in @xcite whose orbits up to some arbitrarily large period are nondegenerate and still knotted  the topology of orbits with large period may be harder to control , but for theorem  [ thm : technical ] this does not matter .",
    "we have chosen to adopt a mainly contact topological perspective on the main theorems of this paper , but for other purposes ( e.g.  quantitative reeb dynamics , cf .",
    "@xcite*3.23 ) , one could also state more quantitatively precise versions of theorem  [ thm : technical ] .",
    "note that no such enhancement is necessary for theorem  [ thm : alldimensions ] , which does not require nondegeneracy , see remark  [ remark : degenerate ] .",
    "all proofs of theorems in this paper follow a similar scheme , which in the case of theorems  [ thm : main ] and  [ thm : alldimensions ] can be described as follows .",
    "suppose @xmath85 is a liouville cobordism from @xmath5 to a standard contact sphere @xmath21 , and let @xmath86 denote the completion obtained by attaching cylindrical ends in the standard way ( see  [ sec : curves ] ) .",
    "then the positive end of @xmath87 can be assumed to match the top half of the symplectization @xmath88 where @xmath69 is the standard contact form , defined by restricting the liouville form @xmath89 to the unit sphere .",
    "we will assume also that the negative end matches @xmath90 \\times m , d(e^r \\alpha)\\right)$ ] where @xmath7 is ( after a positive rescaling ) an arbitrary nondegenerate contact form for @xmath5 .",
    "( the nondegeneracy assumption was not included in theorem  [ thm : alldimensions ] , but this assumption will be easy to remove in the final step , see remark  [ remark : degenerate ] below . )",
    "the first step in the proof is then to choose a suitable almost complex structure @xmath91 on this symplectization that admits a foliation by a @xmath92-dimensional family of @xmath91-holomorphic planes , so - called `` seed curves , '' which are asymptotic to a fixed reeb orbit @xmath9 for @xmath69 that has the smallest possible period",
    ". we will be able to verify explicitly that these planes are _",
    "fredholm regular _ for the moduli problem with fixed asymptotic orbit , hence the moduli space is cut out transversely , and moreover , there exist no other curves in @xmath93 with a single positive end approaching  @xmath9 .",
    "once these curves are understood , we can regard them as living in the cylindrical end @xmath94 , so after extending @xmath91 to a compatible almost complex structure on the rest of @xmath86 , they generate a nonempty moduli space @xmath95 of unparametrized @xmath91-holomorphic planes in @xmath87 , all asymptotic to the same simply covered reeb orbit in the sphere , and this moduli space is a smooth @xmath92-dimensional manifold for generic extensions of @xmath91 since all curves in @xmath95 are somewhere injective .",
    "our main task is then to understand the natural compactification @xmath96 of  @xmath95 , that is to say , the closure of @xmath95 in the space of @xmath91-holomorphic buildings in the sense of @xcite .",
    "the uniqueness of the seed curves in the positive end implies the following :    [ lemma : noupperlevel ] if @xmath97 is a holomorphic building with a nontrivial upper level , then it has exactly one upper level , which consists of one of the seed curves in @xmath93 , and all its other levels are empty .",
    "the lemma means that the only way for a sequence of planes in @xmath95 to `` degenerate '' with something nontrivial happening at the positive end is if the planes simply escape into the positive end and become seed curves ; in particular , this can not happen to any sequence of planes that have points falling into the negative end .",
    "theorem  [ thm : alldimensions ] can now be proved as follows .",
    "let @xmath98 denote the smooth @xmath99-dimensional moduli space consisting of curves in @xmath95 with the additional data of a marked point , hence there is a well - defined evaluation map @xmath100 choose a smooth properly embedded @xmath25-dimensional submanifold @xmath101 with one end in @xmath102 and the other in @xmath103 \\times m$ ] , and perturb it to be transverse to the evaluation map .",
    "then @xmath104 is a smooth @xmath25-dimensional manifold , and it has a unique connected component @xmath105 that contains seed curves in the positive end .",
    "this component has a noncompact end consisting of a family of seed curves that escape to @xmath106 , thus it is manifestly noncompact and therefore diffeomorphic to  @xmath107 .",
    "we claim now that @xmath108 must also contain curves with points that descend arbitrarily far into the negative end . indeed",
    ", the sft compactness theorem would otherwise imply that every sequence in @xmath108 has a subsequence convergent to either an element of @xmath108 or a holomorphic building of the type described in lemma  [ lemma : noupperlevel ] .",
    "but the latter can only happen if the sequence escapes through the neighbourhood of @xmath106 in which all curves are seed curves .",
    "in particular , we obtain a contradiction by considering a noncompact sequence escaping to the _ opposite _ end of @xmath109 from the one consisting of seed curves , and this proves the claim .",
    "it follows that one can find a sequence @xmath110 of curves converging to a holomorphic building @xmath111 with a nontrivial lower level ( see figure  [ fig : planes ] ) .",
    "since the cobordism is exact , every component curve in @xmath112 must have exactly one positive end , and it follows that at least one of the curves in a lower level of @xmath112 is a plane , whose asymptotic orbit is the contractible reeb orbit promised by theorem  [ thm : alldimensions ] .",
    "when holomorphic planes in an exact cobordism converge to a holomorphic building with nontrivial lower levels , at least one of them must include a plane.,width=480 ]    [ remark : degenerate ] to remove the nondegeneracy assumption from theorem  [ thm : alldimensions ] , one can take advantage of the fact that due to the exactness of the cobordism , the contractible orbit found in the above argument comes with an a priori bound on its period",
    ". then if @xmath7 is a degenerate contact form on @xmath5 approximated by a sequence @xmath113 of nondegenerate contact forms , the above argument gives a sequence @xmath114 of contractible reeb orbits with respect to @xmath113 whose periods are uniformly bounded , so by arzel - ascoli , these have a subsequence convergent to a contractible reeb orbit with respect to  @xmath7 .",
    "note that if the orbits @xmath114 are also unknotted , it is not so clear whether the limiting orbit will also be unknotted , hence the need for the more technical theorem  [ thm : technical ] .",
    "the argument described thus far is quite standard and , as mentioned earlier , is largely attributable to hofer @xcite ( though the use of the path @xmath101 to define a @xmath25-dimensional submanifold of the moduli space is borrowed from niederkrger @xcite ) .",
    "the arguments required for finding an orbit that is not only contractible but also _ unknotted _ are significantly subtler , and here we must make liberal use of siefring s intersection theory @xcite in the low - dimensional setting .",
    "to explain the idea , we briefly recall the notion of nicely embedded holomorphic curves , introduced by the second author in @xcite .",
    "the precise definition will be reviewed in ",
    "[ sec : intersection ] , but in essence , a holomorphic curve @xmath115 in a completed @xmath26-dimensional symplectic cobordism @xmath87 is nicely embedded if it has the necessary intersection - theoretic properties to guarantee that it _ does not intersect its neighbors _ in the moduli space .",
    "this condition implies that the moduli space near  @xmath116 can be at most @xmath14-dimensional , and in the @xmath14-dimensional case the curves near @xmath116 form the leaves of a foliation on a neighbourhood of @xmath117 in  @xmath87 .",
    "if @xmath87 is a symplectization @xmath118 or the image of @xmath116 is confined to a cylindrical end , then being nicely embedded has the additional implication that @xmath116 projects to an embedding into  @xmath13 , i.e.  @xmath116 can be written as @xmath119 where the map @xmath120 is also an embedding .",
    "it is easy to show that the seed curves we find in the symplectization of @xmath6 are nicely embedded , and the homotopy invariance of the intersection theory then implies that the same is true for all curves in  @xmath95 .",
    "the fundamental principle behind the proof of theorems  [ thm : main ] and  [ thm : nonprime ] is then the notion that `` nice curves degenerate nicely , '' i.e.  if a sequence @xmath121 converges to a holomorphic building @xmath111 , then we should expect the component curves in levels of @xmath112 to be nicely embedded .",
    "this statement as such is false in full generality ( see @xcite*example  4.22 and remark  4.23 for counterexamples ) , but we will show that it is true in the present situation . as a consequence ,",
    "the plane we find in a lower level of @xmath112 has the form @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is an embedding asymptotic to a contractible reeb orbit .",
    "there remains one complication : the fact that @xmath124 is nicely embedded does not guarantee that its asymptotic orbit must be simply covered , i.e.  the image of @xmath123 might look like an immersed disk that is embedded on the interior but multiply covered on its boundary .",
    "we will show in fact that this can happen , but only in very specific ways , and to prove it , we develop a `` local adjunction formula '' for holomorphic annuli breaking along a reeb orbit .",
    "we now briefly interrupt the outline of the proof to describe a tool of more general applicability . to set the stage ,",
    "suppose that @xmath125 is a @xmath126-convergent sequence of contact forms on a @xmath0-manifold  @xmath13 , and @xmath127 is a corresponding sequence with each @xmath128 belonging to the usual space ( see  [ sec : definitions ] ) of admissible translation - invariant almost complex structures on the symplectization @xmath129 .",
