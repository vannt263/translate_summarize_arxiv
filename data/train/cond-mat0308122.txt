    "in ideal two - dimensional systems the kinetic energy of electrons is completely quenched by perpendicular magnetic field and the macroscopic degeneracy in the partially filled landau level is lifted only by coulomb interaction .",

    ", however , the electrons are equivalent to classical point particles and the ground state is wigner crystal",
    ". there exists competition between the quantum liquid and wigner crystal , and the determination of the phase diagram with respect to the filling factor @xmath3 has been an interesting subject . on the other hand , in higher landau levels , the short range repulsion is reduced because one - particle eigenstates of the electrons extend over space .",
    "the laughlin state is no longer realized in high landau levels . instead",
    ", cdw states called stripe and bubble are predicted in the hartree - fock theory@xcite .",
    "indeed , anisotropic resistivity consistent with the formation of the stripe state has been observed experimentally@xcite .",
    "thus there is another interesting evolution of the ground state when we increase the landau level index @xmath4 .    in the present study",
    ", we investigate the ground state of 2d electrons for wide range of filling by using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method , and determine the phase diagram for landau levels of @xmath0 .",
    "part of the results has already been published@xcite .",
    "here we further investigate the stability of the stripe state in the lowest landau level around @xmath5@xcite , whose period of the stripes is much shorter than that obtained in the composite fermion theory@xcite , and show that a transition to a liquid state takes place when the width of two - dimensional system becomes several times larger than the magnetic length .",
    "we use the hamiltonian of the ideal two - dimensional system in a perpendicular magnetic field , which contains only coulomb interaction , @xmath6 ^2 v(q )   e^{i{\\bf q } \\cdot ( { \\bf r}_i-{\\bf r}_j ) } , \\label{coulomb}\\ ] ] where the coulomb interaction is projected onto the landau level of index @xmath4 , and @xmath7 is the guiding center coordinate of the @xmath8th electron , which satisfies the commutation relation , @xmath9=i\\ell^2\\delta_{jk}$ ] .",
    "@xmath10 are the laguerre polynomials and the magnetic length @xmath11 is set to be 1 .",
    "we assume completely spin polarized ground state and neglect the electrons in fully occupied landau levels .    in order to determine the ground state phase diagram , we need to systematically calculate the ground state at various fillings @xmath3 without any artificial biases . for this purpose",
    "we employ the dmrg method@xcite , which enables us to obtain essentially the exact ground state for large size of systems extending the limitation of the exact diagonalization method . in the dmrg method",
    "we iteratively expand the size of system by adding new local orbitals with restricting the number of basis states using the density matrix calculated from the ground state wave function . the truncation error in the dmrg calculation",
    "is estimated from the eigenvalues of the density matrix and accuracy of the results is systematically improved by increasing the number of basis states retained in the system .    in the present study",
    "we calculate the ground state for various size of systems with up to 25 electrons in the unit cell of @xmath12 with periodic boundary conditions in both @xmath13 and @xmath14 directions .",
    "we choose the aspect ratio @xmath15 by searching an energy minimum with respect to @xmath15 to avoid artificial determination of cdw structure .",
    "the truncation error in the dmrg calculation is typically @xmath16 for 25 electrons with 180 states in each block .",
    "the existing results of exact diagonalizations are completely reproduced within the truncation error .",
    "since the present hamiltonian has the particle - hole symmetry , we only consider the case of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the filling factor of partially filled landau level of index @xmath4 .",
    "we identify the ground state by analyzing the low energy excitations and the pair correlation functions defined by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the ground state .",
    "in the lowest landau level , the pair correlation functions and the size dependence of the excitation gap show the existence of fractional quantum hall states at various @xmath3@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "we have calculated low energy excitations of various systems with up to 25 electrons and confirmed that the excitation gap at @xmath21 decreases with increasing @xmath22 . at @xmath23",
    "the size dependence of the excitation gap is different from that observed at @xmath21 , and the gap seems to vanish in the limit of large system@xcite .",
    "the pair correlation function at @xmath23 confirms liquid ground state as shown in fig .",
    "[ n0gr ] ( a ) .",
    "the effective mass @xmath24 of composite fermions estimated from the size dependence of the excitation gap is about @xmath25 in units of @xmath26 , which is almost consistent with the previous study of the exact diagonalizations on sphere geometry@xcite .",
    "below @xmath27 , we find cdw states between the incompressible states at @xmath21 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ n0gr ] ( b ) , the pair correlation function has stripe structure@xcite but it shows clear oscillations from the origin along the stripe .",
    "this structure is different from the stripes in higher landau levels near half filling , and we refer this new state as type ii stripe state ( stripe ii ) @xcite . in order to investigate the stability of this stripe state",
    ", we slightly decrease the short range components of the effective interaction represented by the haldane s pseudo potentials , @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite . the obtained ground state around @xmath5 is summarized in fig .",

    ", we find a transition to a liquid state .",
    "such decrease in the short range pseudo potentials is realized in real systems , which have finite width perpendicular to the two - dimensional plane .",
    "since a few percent decrease @xmath30 corresponds to a width of several times the magnetic length @xcite , the stripes in the lowest landau level are not realized in wide quantum wells and under high magnetic fields .",
    "this stripe state may be related to the reentrant insulating phase above @xmath31 recently observed in a narrow quantum well@xcite .    with further decreasing @xmath3 ,",
    "the cdw structure is enhanced , and the first order transition to wigner crystal takes place at @xmath32@xcite . at @xmath33",
    "the short range pair correlation function is similar to that of the cdw state around @xmath33 but the ground state continuously connects to the laughlin state , which is an exact ground state in the limit of large @xmath28 and @xmath29@xcite .    in the second lowest landau level ,",

    "the correlation function is similar to that observed in higher landau levels , which we call type i stripe state , but the amplitude of the stripes is 50% smaller and the period is 30% shorter than those observed in @xmath41 landau level .",
    "below @xmath42 , the ground state correlation functions become similar to the type ii stripe state obtained in the lowest landau level . at @xmath43",
    "the ground state correlation function seems to be quite different from that of the laughlin state in the lowest landau level .",
    "however the ground state continuously connects to the laughlin state@xcite .",
    "the excitation gap is very small and the pair correlation function near the origin is enhanced from that of the laughlin state .",
    "this is due to the large reduction of the short range repulsion @xmath28 in the second lowest landau level . on the other hand ,",
    "the ground state at @xmath44 is almost identical to that in the lowest landau level , because @xmath29 in the second lowest landau level is slightly larger than that of the lowest landau level .",
    "the ground state at low fillings is almost the same to that in the lowest landau level , and the first order transition to wigner crystal is expected at @xmath45@xcite .",
    "the ground state phase diagram in the third lowest landau level is presented in fig .",

    "the type i stripe state shown in fig .",

    "[ cdw ] ( b ) is found .",
    "since the correlation function sharply changes at the phase boundary , the transition between the stripe state and the bubble state is expected to be first order . with further decreasing @xmath18 ,",
    "the bubble state becomes unstable and different ground state characterized by wigner crystal is realized@xcite .",
    "in the present paper we have studied the ground state of 2d electrons in landau levels of @xmath0 by using the dmrg method . from the analysis of the pair correlation functions and low energy excitations , we have determined the phase diagram consisting of various quantum liquids and cdw states . in particular we have found the stripe state in the lowest landau level , which is realized only when the width of two - dimensional system is smaller than several times the magnetic length",
