    "one of the major goals of contemporary theoretical hypernuclear physics is to calculate the properties of hypernuclei starting from the bare interactions between nucleons and hyperons .",
    "however , the @xmath2 interaction is not well understood due to the very limited @xmath2 scattering database .",
    "hypernuclei therefore provide an important source of constraints on and serve as a testing ground for the @xmath2 interaction , as well as the @xmath6 interaction where no scattering data are available .",
    "chiral perturbation theory seems to be a promising bridge which allows us to connect qcd in the strangeness sector with low - energy hypernuclear physics @xcite .",
    "moreover , lattice qcd simulations are approaching a level where they can provide additional constraints on the baryon ",
    "baryon interaction @xcite . in the near future ,",
    "a significant part of the research program in new facilities , like j - parc in japan and fair in germany , will be devoted to strangeness physics .",
    "the proposed experiments will , in part , focus on accurate measurements of energy spectra of @xmath7 and @xmath8 hypernuclei @xcite . to properly connect the characteristics of hypernuclei with the underlying @xmath2 and @xmath6 interactions reliable calculations with realistic interactions are necessary .",
    "nevertheless , only very few _ ab initio _ or _ exact _ calculations of hypernuclei are available for 3- and 4-body systems @xcite . for @xmath9 only a handful of _ ab initio _ approaches are applicable",
    ".    in section [ sec : methodology ] , the methodology used in our calculations is briefly introduced , and in section [ sec : results ] we present first demonstrative results .",
    "brief summary with outlook is given in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "our approach is based on the no - core shell model technique @xcite which we have extended to incorporate strangeness degrees of freedom .",
    "the no - core shell model technique is one of the most powerful and universal _ ab initio _ methods in nuclear structure calculations . in the ncsm",
    ", the total hamiltonian of the system is diagonalized in a _ finite _",
    "@xmath10-body ho basis which is truncated by a maximal ho excitation energy @xmath11 with respect to the unperturbed ground state of the @xmath10-body system . in the present calculations we utilize the relative jacobi - coordinate ho basis , which enable us to perform calculations in larger model spaces compared to calculations in a conventional slater - determinant ho basis since",
    "the center - of - mass degrees of freedom are explicitly removed and a basis coupled to a total angular momentum and isospin is used .",
    "unlike standard shell model calculations , in the ncsm all particles are treated as active .",
    "this allows us to employ realistic @xmath1 and @xmath2 interactions . in this work",
    "we use the chiral n@xmath12lo @xmath1 interaction @xcite and the chiral lo @xmath2 interaction with cutoff @xmath13  mev @xcite . in the following calculations",
    "the potentials are used in a `` bare '' form without constructing any effective interaction tailored to a specific model space .",
    "the results of calculations are thus variational with respect to the model space truncation .",
    "as a function of the size of the model space @xmath14 calculated with the chiral @xmath1 and @xmath2 forces . results of calculations in the presence ( absence ) of the explicit @xmath15 hyperon mixing in the hypernuclear state are denoted by full ( open ) circles for the optimal ho frequencies . the measured value of the hypertriton ground state energy is shown by straight line.,scaledwidth=77.0% ]    our aim is to develop an _ ab initio _ method for heavier @xmath16- and @xmath17-shell hypernuclei . in our initial calculations we focus primarily on the applicability of the ncsm to nuclear systems with nonzero strangeness , particularly on the convergence properties and their dependence on the size of the model space .",
    "we performed calculations of hypertriton @xmath18h , @xmath19h and @xmath19he with realistic chiral @xmath1 and @xmath2 potentials .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , the hypertriton ground state energy is shown as a function of the size of the model space , calculated using the chiral @xmath1 and @xmath2 interactions . the results of calculations with the explicit @xmath20 hyperon mixing in the hypertriton state ( full circles ) are compared to those calculated in the absence of explicit @xmath21 mixing ( open circles ) .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath21 hyperon mixing is essential in light hypernuclear systems @xcite . due to the extremely weak binding of the hypertriton , @xmath22  mev @xcite ,",
    "the convergence with @xmath23 is very slow , as illustrated in the figure .",
    "preliminary extrapolation of the hypertriton ground state energy to the infinite model space limit gives @xmath24  mev .",
    "fortunately , in case of heavier and more bound and compact systems , such as @xmath5h and @xmath5he , the convergence with the size of the model space is much faster , as shown in figures [ fig:2 ] and [ fig:3 ] . here",
    "the @xmath0 hyperon separation energies , @xmath25 , in the @xmath26 and @xmath27 states of @xmath5h and @xmath5he are shown as functions of the size of the model space , calculated with the chiral @xmath1 and @xmath2 interactions .",
    "the results of calculations approach the measured @xmath0 hyperon separation energies in the @xmath26(@xmath27 ) state of @xmath5h and @xmath5he , @xmath28  mev and @xmath29  mev @xcite .",
    "the results of our calculations demonstrate that the ncsm formalism presents a powerful and promising tool to study nuclear systems with nonzero strangeness .",
    "it is rather straightforward , and currently under development , to extend the ncsm methodology to heavier , @xmath9 , hypernuclei .",
    "nevertheless , more work is needed to carry out systematic studies of the underlying interactions , perform calculations in larger model spaces or employ effective interactions , and include ( possibly ) @xmath30 forces .",

    "our first results for @xmath32h , @xmath5h and @xmath5he using chiral @xmath1 and @xmath2 forces look promising and give reasonable description of experimental data .",
    "the ncsm approach seems to be a viable candidate for the _ ab initio _ description of hypernuclei in the @xmath33 mass region . in case of @xmath32h the convergence with the size of the model space",
