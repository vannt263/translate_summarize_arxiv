    "the white dashed curves superimposed on the density plot show the adiabatic thomas - fermi radius , which would mark the approximate edge of the condensate cloud , if the ramping of the interaction strength were infinitely slow .",
    "as observed in the main text , the condensate does expand when the repulsive interaction increases ; but as the interaction increases more and more rapidly , the increasing pressure which it supplies can not expand the gas fast enough to maintain the even more rapidly increasing equilibrium size .",
    "the actual condensate size therefore falls below the instantaneous equilibrium thomas - fermi radius ( at least within gross - pitaevskii mean - field theory ) .",
    "we can quantify this breakdown in adiabaticity of the condensate cloud size by fitting the actual condensate density profile to a thomas - fermi - like parabola , @xmath110 and @xmath111 independently at each instant @xmath5 .",
    "these fits are quite good  the actual density envelope remains quite parabolic , even though the width of the parabola lags behind the adiabatic thomas - fermi value . from this time - dependent parabolic fit ,",
    "we obtain the fitted instantaneous interaction strength @xmath111 for which that parabolic density profile would be the thomas - fermi ground state .",
    "the resulting @xmath111 is shown as the dotted curve in fig .",
    "s-2 , along with the actual interaction strength @xmath112 , shown as a solid curve .",
    "since the initial state has been well relaxed ( by imaginary time evolution with fixed normalization ) , at an initial interaction @xmath113 large enough for the thomas - fermi approximation to gross - pitaevskii density envelope to be quite accurate , the initial fit value @xmath114 coincides closely with the actual interaction strength @xmath113 .",
    "as the time - dependent condensate fails to sustain the rapidly increasing thomas - fermi radius of instantaneous equilibrium , the thomas - fermi - fitted effective interaction strength @xmath111 fails to rise as fast as the actual @xmath115 : the dashed curve falls away from the solid curve significantly from about half - way through the plotted time interval .",
    "the initial state used for both a and b plots was prepared by relaxation ( gross - pitaevskii evolution in imaginary time ) while maintaining @xmath116 , with interaction @xmath76 . by including a zero in the trial wave function before relaxation , however , and stopping relaxation before the zero filled in",
    ", the initial state was prepared with a dark soliton at @xmath117 . in the subsequent real time evolution shown in the plots ,",
    "this soliton moves and changes width , while the whole cloud expands ; in experiment b , the soliton narrows as the repulsive interaction strengthens .",
    "such a narrowing would be expected adiabatically , if the interaction were increased very slowly ; when the interaction strengthens too quickly , however , the soliton may not have time to become as narrow as it would in the adiabatic limit .",
    "the adiabatic soliton width is determined by three factors : the ` grayness ' of the soliton ( which increases when the soliton moves ) ; the local gas density near the soliton , which is well described by the instantaneous thomas - fermi envelope described above ; and the interaction strength @xmath118 . to quantify",
    "how closely the soliton narrowing adapts to the changing interaction strength , independently of the soliton grayness and ambient density , we can approximate the harmonic potential as constant over the width of the soliton , and then approximate the gross - pitaevskii evolution of @xmath119 near the soliton with the integrable nonlinear schrdinger equation @xmath120\\tilde{\\psi}(x , t)\\;\\ ] ] where the effective trap potential at the soliton @xmath121 , and the effective interaction @xmath122 which is ` felt ' by the soliton , are considered as constants . moving grey soliton solutions to ( [ gpad ] )",
    "are given by the ansatz         of the actual contact interaction strength @xmath81 ( solid curve ) and of two effective interaction strengths @xmath127 ( dash - dotted curve ) and @xmath111 ( dotted curve ) , obtained by fitting small- and large - scale features of the density profile , respectively , as explained in the supplementary text .",
    "the effective interaction @xmath111 represents the constant interaction strength for which the instantaneous parabolic envelope of the density profile would be a thomas - fermi ground state of the form ( [ parabola ] ) . the effective interaction @xmath127 represents the constant interaction strength for which the part of @xmath119 near the soliton would be a gray soliton solution to the integrable nonlinear schrdinger equation obtained by approximating the harmonic potential as constant . the fact that @xmath127 follows @xmath115 more closely",
    "than @xmath111 shows that the condensate remains locally adiabatic on short length scales for longer than it remains adiabatic globally.,width=288 ]    for each time @xmath5 , then , we fit the actual density profile @xmath74 to the ansatz @xmath128 near the soliton , by tuning @xmath125 , @xmath124 , @xmath126 and @xmath122 .",
    "the fits remain good , near the soliton , at all times .",
    "the resulting fitted @xmath127 then represents the effective interaction strength ` felt ' by the soliton at time @xmath5 : it is the constant interaction strength for which the instantaneous @xmath119 would be a gray soliton solution locally , given the instantaneous grayness parameter @xmath124 and local envelope density @xmath129 .",
    "this fitted @xmath127 is shown as the dash - dotted curve in fig .",
    "s-2 . like the analogous effective interaction strength @xmath111 implied by the overall condensate radius , the effective interaction strength @xmath127 implied by the instantaneous soliton width also lags behind the actual interaction strength @xmath115 as it increases .",
    "( it seems to follow a power law : @xmath130^{0.89}$ ] . )",
    "we can note , however , that @xmath127 follows the actual @xmath115 much more closely than @xmath111 does ( which does not appear to obey any comparable power law ) .",
    "the soliton width behaves more adiabatically , for longer , than the overall condensate cloud size .",
    "this differential adiabaticity , depending on length scale , is physically intuitive .",
    "the dynamical time scale for large - scale changes of the overall density profile is that of low - frequency collective modes of the condensate : it is on the order of the harmonic trap period .",
    "the soliton , however , is a structure on the scale of the local healing length ; the characteristic time scale for evolution on this shorter length scale is correspondingly shorter .",
    "we therefore expect that the more rapidly responding soliton width will be better able to follow the changing @xmath115 than the more slowly reacting thomas - fermi radius .",
    "adiabaticity breaks down on large scales ( globally ) before it breaks down on small scales ( locally ) .",
    "the evolution in experiment b is therefore quite interesting , because for initial conditions which feature structures on different length scales , it can reveal how adiabaticity and equilibration occur at different rates on those different length scales , so that a quantum gas may be both in and out of equilibrium , in different respects , at the same time . the failure of mean - field theory at stronger interactions , or even initially because of quantum or thermal depletion",
    ", will invalidate our plotted mean - field evolution ; but it will only make the real experiment b even more interesting .",
    "this non - trivial experiment may nonetheless be simulated exactly in every respect , with all possible quantum and thermal and non - equilibrium corrections fully included , by the standard expansion of experiment a  when the exact spacetime mapping is applied ."

    "<S> the spacetime transformation maps the two plots onto each other . </S>",
    "<S> even when mean - field theory is not valid , the quantum field mapping remains exact ; this figure illustrates how it can relate non - trivial experiments . here </S>",
    "<S> the initial state contains a dark soliton , which moves and changes in width while the whole cloud expands , and demonstrates how adiabaticity can break down at different times on different length scales . </S>",

    "<S> we can not plot a quantum field , but it is straightforward to show that the spacetime transformation ( [ dual ] ) also serves to map between the classical field equations that are obtained by replacing the operator fields with complex c - number fields . </S>",
    "<S> these classical field theories are only mean - field approximations to quantum many - body dynamics , but they obey the same spacetime mapping identity , and thus serve to illustrate it .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figs ] shows @xmath83 and @xmath74 corresponding to the gross - pitaevskii mean - field approximation to the gas density in experiments a and b , respectively , for a quasi - one - dimensional single - component bose - einstein condensate with a repulsive contact interaction @xmath84 whose initial state features a single dark soliton , slightly displaced from the center of the trap . </S>",
    "<S> experiment a is the familiar scenario of free expansion with @xmath80 . in experiment b , however , we see non - equilibrium response of the trapped gas to a temporally nonlinear ramping of the interaction strength @xmath81 . as the dashed lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b show , the gas cloud at first expands adiabatically to follow the instantaneous thomas - fermi ground state , but when the equilibrium thomas - fermi radius increases too rapidly , the actual expansion of the gas fails to keep up . with increasingly strong nonlinearity , </S>",
    "<S> the soliton also narrows , but eventually it fails to shrink fast enough to maintain an equilibrium shape . </S>",
    "<S> we show in the supplementary material that the soliton width tracks its equilibrium value for a longer time than the thomas - fermi radius follows its equilibrium value , indicating that the gas loses equilibrium globally before losing it locally .    even just in mean - field theory </S>",
    "<S> , therefore , experiment b is non - trivial ; and yet it is related exactly to free expansion by the spacetime mapping ( [ dual ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the mean - field initial state is only accurate for a gas whose thermal excitation and quantum depletion are both negligible ; and mean - field theory will eventually break down in any case , in both experiments , as the one - dimensional density becomes low ( in a ) or the interaction becomes strong ( in b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of our mapping for the quantum field operators , however , means that whatever the actual quantum evolution of the gas may be , the observations in a and b scenarios will still be related by ( [ identity ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> time - dependent potentials and interactions are well - established experimental tools in today s quantum gas labs , and the mapping between an isotropic harmonic trap and no trap was just one special case of @xmath85 and @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> since our exact spacetime mapping is so general , allowing arbitrary @xmath86 and applying to arbitrary measurements on arbitrary mixtures of multi - component bose and fermi gases with many realistically possible interactions , prepared in any initial states , it is a strong prediction from quantum field theory which can be tested in a wide range of real quantum gas systems . </S>",
    "<S> if the mapping is experimentally confirmed , it can become a tool to expand experimental technique , by allowing time - dependent traps to mimic time - dependent interactions , or vice versa ; or it may be used to test for experimental errors . </S>",
    "<S> the mapping identity may also be a useful benchmark for theoretical approximations : failure to fulfill it will mark limits of validity .    </S>",
