    "thermodynamics of trajectories proposes a set of powerful tools that fully characterises the dynamics of open systems  @xcite .",
    "the formalism was only recently extended from classical to quantum systems  @xcite , promising to shed a new light on the behaviour of even well - known quantum systems . through the determination of the scaled cumulant generating function ,",
    "also known as the large - deviation function , the full counting statistics of the exchange of excitations taking place between a system and its environment can be studied .",
    "this approach allows one to spot dynamical phase transitions directly through the determination of the large - deviation function , promising it a bright future  @xcite .    despite the fact that this large - deviation approach is founded on simple principles , however ,",
    "severe difficulties are generally encountered when applying it to physical systems .",
    "chief amongst these is the difficulty in determining the large - deviation function ; indeed , only a few analytical results are known from a handful of classical and quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "naturally , this dramatically restricts the usefulness of applying thermodynamics of trajectories and makes the use of dedicated numerical methods essential  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present an alternative route towards accessing the same information that is encoded in the large - deviation function , by exploiting the fact that the first few cumulants of the probability distribution of the exchange statistics already contain a wealth of information about this distribution .",
    "we obtain an efficient iterative approach that allows one to determine successive cumulants , giving access to characteristics of the dynamics that are usually not easily accessible or calculated .",
    "furthermore , this method allows one to gain a deeper understanding of certain features in the dynamics of open quantum systems , such as dynamical phase transitions .",
    "it also allows one to reinterpret well - known phenomena in open quantum systems , as we illustrate here by studying an optical system that presents bistability .",
    "the method we propose here has the added benefit of being conceptually similar to approaches used previously that were tailored for specific phenomena , such as resonance fluorescence  @xcite and electronic transport statistics  @xcite .    in what follows ,",
    "we begin by introducing thermodynamics of trajectories of open quantum systems and detailing the iterative method we propose .",
    "next , we start exploring the application of our method by using it to study a small , two - qubit , quantum system ; this reveals the usefulness of our approach even in the case where alternative approaches are available . finally , we study a system associated with an infinite liouville space , i.e. , a quantum harmonic oscillator , for which the usual non - numerical approaches to determining the large - deviation function fail .",
    "we devote this section to a formal development of the proposed method .",
    "first , we briefly introduce thermodynamics of trajectories as a formalism that helps to analyse the dynamics of open quantum systems , and as developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . following this",

    "we consider a single one of these channels , with which we associate a counting process @xmath9 ; more details regarding this can be found in ref .",
    "we can now define the moment generating function , which gives access to all the moments ( equivalently , cumulants ) of the probability distribution associated with the statistics of @xmath10 . to this end",
    ", we apply large - deviation theory  @xcite and write @xmath11 where @xmath12 , with @xmath13 being the projector over the subspace corresponding to a count @xmath10 , is called the _ biased density matrix_. it can be decomposed into sets of trajectories named _",

    "we restrict ourselves in this article to counting processes associated with a single channel .",
    "nevertheless , the very same framework described here and in the next section can be derived for other , more general , counting processes .    the @xmath14-biased ensemble , which is unnormalised and therefore can not be interpreted as a density matrix , undergoes a dynamics governed by the equation @xmath17+\\mathcal{l}_{s}[\\varrho_{s}],\\label{eq : master - biased}\\ ] ] where the biasing superoperator @xmath18 is given by @xmath19=\\gamma_i(e^{-s}-1)\\hat{l}_i\\bullet\\hat{l}_i^\\dagger.\\label{eq : b - superop}\\ ] ]    taking the time derivative of the cumulant generating function @xmath20 we find that @xmath21 \\right\\}/{\\mathrm{tr}}\\left\\ { \\varrho_{s } \\right\\}$ ] , because the superoperator @xmath2 is trace - preserving .",

    "we will first consider one or more systems that present only a single dynamical phase , using this to illustrate how the method proposed here gives analytical results that are not accessible through the numerical determination of @xmath16 .",
    "following this , we will discuss an example of a dynamical phase transition , where the dynamics converges to two distinct steady states .",
    "spin systems , especially ones composed of spins-@xmath78 , have the strong advantage in the present context of residing on a rather small liouville space : the dynamics of such a system may easily be resolved through analytic or numerical methods . for what concerns us ,",

    "( [ eq : master - biased ] ) . for cases where the long - time dynamics of the density matrix @xmath32 can not be directly resolved in matrix form , it is still possible to vectorise the biased master equation and to obtain @xmath16 directly as the slowest - decaying eigenvalue of the matrix corresponding to @xmath80 , i.e. , the eigenvalue with the most positive real part .",
    "both approaches are equivalent and give direct access to the large - deviation function , thereby permitting a full characterisation of the dynamics of the system through the counting process @xmath10 .",
    "on the one hand , for any but the simplest of systems , this very powerful method reduces to numerical diagonalisation of matrices , and therefore can not be used to derive analytic expressions of the cumulants of the counting process . on the other hand , the iterative method we propose here does give access to these analytical expressions .",

    "by contrast , the method we propose gives access to analytical expressions to be obtained for successive cumulants of the spin - flip statistics .",

    "consequently direct resolution of the biased master equation does not , in general , allow to capture the origin of the existing dual dynamics and its dependence on the initial conditions , even if this is obvious in the present case .",

    "+ in this section we focused exclusively on small spin systems which evolve within a relatively small liouville space . for these systems we saw",
    "some of the main advantages of the iterative method proposed here , namely ( i )  allowing analytical determination of the first cumulants of the exchange statistics , and ( ii )  revealing the origin of dynamical phase transitions . in the following section we will consider systems residing in an infinite liouville space , which consequently can not be resolved exactly through direct analysis of the biased density matrix and its dynamics as given in eq .  (",
    "[ eq : ldf - integral ] ) .",
    "in this section we will move away from systems residing in small liouville spaces to ones residing in infinite spaces .",
    "such systems pose challenges to traditional analyses , numerical or analytical , for obtaining the large - deviation function from the biased master equation . in previous work",
    "we showed how an exact analytical solution may be found in the case of a single harmonic oscillator  @xcite and made steps towards obtaining efficient numerical solutions that may be used for generic networks of harmonic oscillators  @xcite .",
    "we stress once again that it is only in a few exceptional cases that the large - deviation function may be obtained analytically .",
    "in contrast , the present technique will allow to access not the large - deviation function itself , but analytical formulations for the first few cumulants .",
    "as a first example in an infinite liouville space , let us consider a system composed of two squeezed thermal harmonic oscillators .      a system composed of two thermal squeezed harmonic oscillator modes is well - studied in the context of quantum optics , providing a simple paradigmatic system to study bipartite continuous variable states  @xcite .",
    "such a system is also easily experimentally realised , corresponding as it does to spontaneous parametric down - conversion  @xcite .",
    "most work done on this system so far has , however , focused on its internal dynamics .",
    "what we are interested in here , on the other hand , is the statistics of the output of the system , in a similar manner as our earlier work  @xcite .",
    "we start by considering two quantum harmonic oscillators coupled through a squeezing - like interaction as described by the hamiltonian @xmath118 where @xmath119 ( @xmath83 ) corresponds to the creation ( annihilation ) operator associated to the oscillator @xmath8 .",
    "the two oscillators are assumed to have the same frequency and are damped independently by means of the liouville operators @xmath120 and damping rates @xmath121 .",
    "we shall consider a counting process that keeps track of the number of excitations leaving the oscillator @xmath97 to its bath .",
    "solving the biased master equation is not possible due to the infinite size of the liouville space involved .",
    "nonetheless , we showed in earlier work  @xcite that by taking into account the linear nature of the dynamics , originating from a hamiltonian that is quadratic in the operators , making a gaussian ansatz for the state of the system , and moving to a phase space representation , the exchange statistics can be explored in detail . in a nutshell",
    ", this framework reduces the problem to numerically solving an algebraic riccati equation , for which efficient algorithms are available .",
    "however , here we are interested in accessing the analytical formulation of the first cumulants of the statistics . to this end , and as detailed in [ sec : a2 ] , we develop the same iterative method as before but this time in terms of gaussian parameters that correspond to a phase space representation of the situation .",
    "there is one key difference between the method we apply here , specialised to gaussian states , and the more general one in previous sections . whereas before we proceeded by determining the long - time behaviour of a given order of the biased density matrix @xmath48 related to the master equation given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ccdcd ] ) , in this context it is the biased covariance matrix of the same order , @xmath122 , that lies at the centre of our method .",
    "this biased covariance matrix is associated with a lyapunov equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : dddf ] ) .",
    "indeed , one computational advantage of this iterative method is that it requires the solution of a set of lyapunov equations , one for each order of the biased covariance matrix , @xmath123 , rather than an algebraic riccati equation for @xmath124 .",
    "this reduces significantly the complexity of the problem .    in the present case we have for the drift matrix @xmath125",
    "the noise matrix is diagonal and has the form @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the @xmath128 identity matrix .",
    "taking @xmath86 for simplicity , we obtain the first and second cumulants @xmath129 we see that deriving exact analytic definition of the mean and variance of the number of excitations exchanged between mode @xmath97 and the environment becomes here a simple task , and may for example lead to estimation of key parameters such as @xmath130 . having access to such relations also allows connections to be made between the output statistics of a system and its state . for example , the degree of squeezing of the modes of such a system is a key parameter that is of prime importance . for the minimal quadrature of the mode s degrees of freedom",
    "we find in this case that  @xcite @xmath131 which may be rewritten using the definition of the first cumulant as @xmath132 this connects the degree of squeezing directly to experimentally - measurable statistics .",
    "this example again illustrates the possible advantage that one can get from the iterative method we have described , as applied to a harmonic oscillator network .",
    "the method itself is not restricted to linear dynamics as presented here , however .",
    "indeed , it may also allow to draw rather fundamental statements about the behaviour of systems undergoing non - linear dynamics , based on the language of thermodynamics of trajectories .",
    "to illustrate this point , we shall now consider the dynamics of a harmonic oscillator with a kerr non - linearity .      for this final example , we consider a quasi - resonantly driven oscillator possessing a kerr non - linearity  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of this system corresponds to various experiments , especially those conducted in the context of non - linear optical devices  @xcite , and evolves under the hamiltonian @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 correspond respectively to the driving strength and frequency , and @xmath130 to the non - linear coupling .",
    "the operator @xmath136 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an excitation in the oscillator .",
    "we consider dissipation to take place to a single thermal bath , as described by the liouville operator @xmath137 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) and considering as a counting process the net number of excitations leaving the system to the environment , we solve for the stationary regime and find the first cumulant @xmath138 where @xmath139 . in the heisenberg picture",

    "( [ eq : la ] ) links the number @xmath28 to the driving intensity , and corresponds to the hysteresis curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kerr ] .",
    "we can refine our study by considering the stability of the mean field with respect to small fluctuations using the hurwitz criterion  @xcite , which guarantees stability for @xmath147 and @xmath148 , where @xmath149 the unstable region , @xmath150 , corresponds to the dashed part of the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : kerr ] . from this plot",
    "we clearly see the rich dynamical behaviour of the system : for low enough driving the system remains in a linear phase , while for strong enough driving it will be in a non - linear phase . in between , due to the balance between non - linearity and dissipation",
    ", we find a bistable region where both solutions corresponding to the linear and non - linear phase are stable solution of the mean - field stationary state .",
    "more refined approaches can be used to extract more accurately the system behaviour , however the mean field already captures the main dynamical characteristics of the system .    ,",
    "due to non - linearity as a function of the driving intensity @xmath151 for @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "the vertical red lines indicate the limit of the bistable region.[fig : kerr ] ]    as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 - 1 ] ) , the first cumulant of the output statistics is derived directly from the density of excitation of the system , @xmath154 , which behaves differently in the three regimes previously mentioned , and which therefore depends strongly on the intensity of excitation @xmath151 .",
    "the intermediate regime , corresponding to the bistable case , will consequently yield a situation where the first cumulant of the output of the system can take two distinct values @xmath155 where @xmath156 correspond to the density on the upper ( @xmath157 ) and lower ( @xmath158 ) curve in the bistable region .",
    "this is the signature of a first - order dynamical phase transition as explained in sec .",
    "[ sub : multi - stability - and - dynamical ] . based only on the first moment of the exchange statistics , we are able here to spot a dynamical phase transition in a well - known system .",
    "the link between between the thermodynamics of phase transitions and non - linear optical systems was previously considered  @xcite , but we see here how taking the point of view of thermodynamics of trajectories allows it to pass from a simple analogy to a correspondence .",
    "in this article we proposed an efficient method to determine the statistics of the exchange of excitations between an open quantum system and its environment .",
    "this method is based on the formalism of thermodynamics of trajectories and has the key advantage of giving access to the cumulants , or moments , of these statistics with much less mathematical effort than that required to obtain the large - deviation function .",
    "the method we present is iterative , giving access to successive cumulants , and may be compared straightforwardly with experiment , where only the first few moments are usually accessible .",
    "we have shown that this method reveals more information on the nature of the dynamics undergone by the system than numerical evaluation of the large - deviation function , especially in scenarios where the system dynamics presents a dynamical phase transition .",

    "in sec .  [ sub : iterative ] we presented an iterative method to obtain the first cumulants of the exchange statistics , formulated in terms of expectation values of the different orders of the biased density matrix @xmath159 .",
    "depending on the situation considered , and as summarised in table  [ tab : ssxs ] , this formulation may be more efficient since it only consists of finding the long - time evolution of a number of expectation values . in the following ,",
