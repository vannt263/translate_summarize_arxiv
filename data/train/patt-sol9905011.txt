    "the propagation of solitons in the presence of inhomogeneities concerns a wide variety of condensed matter systems .",
    "the traditional approach considers structureless solitons and delta - function - like impurities .",
    "real scenarios involve finite - width impurities and under certain circunstances , the extended character of the soliton must be considered@xcite .",
    "for instance , the lenght scale competition between the width of inhomogeneities , the distance between them and the width of the kink - soliton leads to interesting phenomena like soliton explosions@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we take into account the extended character of both the soliton and the impurity and show that these considerations lead to the existence of a finite number of soliton internal modes that underlies a rich spatiotemporal dynamics .",
    "we present a model for which the exact stationary soliton solution in the presence of inhomogeneities can be obtained and the stability problem can be solved exactly .",
    "we use the karhunen - love ( kl ) decomposition to relate the excitation of soliton internal modes with the sequence of bifurcations obtained as the amplitude of a space - time - dependent driving force ( fitted to the shape of the translational mode ) is increased .",
    "the topological solitons studied in the present paper possess important applications in condensed matter physics . for instance , in solid state physics , they describe domain walls in ferromagnets or ferroelectric materials , dislocations in crystals , charge - density waves , interphase boundaries in metal alloys , fluxons in long josephson junctions and josephson transmission lines , etc.@xcite    although some of the above mentioned systems are described by the @xmath0-model and others by the sine - gordon equation ( and these equations , in their unperturbed versions , present differences like the fact that the sine - gordon equation is completely integrable whereas the @xmath0-model is not ) the properties of the solitons supported by sine - gordon and @xmath0 equations are very similar .",
    "in fact , these equations are _ topologically equivalent _ and very often the result obtained for one of them can be applied to the other@xcite .    here",
    "we consider the @xmath0 equation in the presence of inhomogeneities and damping :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is a function with ( at least ) one zero and @xmath3 is a bell - shaped function that rapidly decays to zero for @xmath4 .",
    "an impurity of the kind @xmath5 , but using delta functions , has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in ferroelectric materials",
    "@xmath6 is the displacement of the ions from their equilibrium position in the lattice , @xmath7 is the force due to the anharmonic crystalline potential , @xmath2 is an applied electric field , and @xmath3 describes an impurity in one of the anharmonic oscillators of the lattice@xcite . in josephson junctions",
    ", @xmath8 is the phase difference of the superconducting electrons across the junction , @xmath2 is the external current , and @xmath3 can describe a microshort or a microresistor@xcite . in a josephson transmission line it is possible to apply nonuniformly distributed current sources ( @xmath2 ) and to create inhomogeneities of type @xmath3 using different electronic circuits in some specific elements of the chain@xcite .    in the present paper the functions @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "will be defined as ,    @xmath9    @xmath10    the case @xmath11 has been studied in many papers ( see e.g. @xcite ) . here",
    "( [ aa:1 ] ) represents an external field ( or a source current in a josephson junction ) that is almost constant in most part of the chain but changes its sign in @xmath12 ( this is very important in order to have soliton pinning@xcite ) .",
    "microshorts , microresistors or impurities in atomic chains@xcite are usually described by dirac s delta functions ( @xmath13 ) where the width of the impurity is neglected .",
    "the function @xmath14 is topologically equivalent to a @xmath15 but it allows us to consider the influence of the width of the impurity .",
    "suppose the existence of a static kink solution @xmath16 corresponding to a soliton placed in a stable equilibrium state created by the inhomogeneities of eq .",
    "( [ a:1 ] ) .",
    "we analyze the small amplitude oscillations around the kink solution @xmath17 .",
    "we get for the function @xmath18 the following equation :    @xmath19    the study of the stability of the equilibrium solution @xmath16 leads to the following eigenvalue problem ( we introduce @xmath20 into eq .",
    "( [ a:3 ] ) ) :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 .    for the functions",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 ( defined as eqs.([aa:1]-[aa:2 ] ) ) the exact solution describing the static soliton can be written : @xmath23 . the spectral problem ( eq .",
    "( [ a:4 ] ) ) brings the following eigenvalues for the discrete spectrum : @xmath24 ; here @xmath25 is defined as , @xmath26 .",
    "the integer part of @xmath25 ( @xmath27 $ ] ) defines the number of modes of the discrete spectrum .",
    "the stability condition for the translational mode is , @xmath28 .",
    "when this condition is not fulfilled ( thus the equilibrium point @xmath12 is unstable ) and @xmath29 , then there will exist three equilibrium points for the soliton : two stable ( at points @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) and one unstable at point @xmath12 .",
    "this is because for huge values of @xmath32 the leading inhomogeneity is @xmath2 , which is non - local and not zero at infinity .",
    "this inhomogeneity acts as a restoring force that pushes the soliton towards the point @xmath12 . as a result of the competition between the local instability induced by @xmath5 at point @xmath33 and the non - local inhomogeneity @xmath2 ,",
    "an effective double - well potential is created .",
    "this is equivalent to a pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "we should make some remarks about the stability investigation .",
    "writing down eq .",
    "( [ a:3 ] ) we are making an approximation because the terms @xmath34 and @xmath35 are considered zero . under this assumption the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ a:3 ] ) can be used as an approximation for the kink dynamics only for small perturbation of the static soliton solution .",
    "however , the stability conditions obtained for the different modes are exact . in fact , when we say that the traslational mode is stable for some set of values of the parameters , this means that in a neighborhood of this equilibrium point the effective potential for the soliton center of mass is a well ( a minimum ) . on the contrary ,",
    "when the parameters are changed such that the stability condition does not hold anymore , then a small deviation in the initial condition of the soliton center of mass will cause the soliton to move away from the equilibrium position .",
    "the same is valid for the stability of the shape modes .",
    "for example , if the stability condition for the first shape mode is not satisfied , then small perturbation of the soliton profile will cause the soliton to explode .",
    "this has been checked numerically@xcite .",
    "in general , the stability problems for perturbed soliton equations are very hard@xcite .",
    "this is because in order to solve it , we first should have an exact solution of the equilibrium problem ( which is rarely the case ) , and then one should solve the eigenvalue problem which usually has no solution in terms of elementary functions .",
    "the investigation we have performed includes several steps .",
    "first , we have to solve an inverse problem in order to have external perturbations with the `` shapes '' that are relevant to the physical situations we want to discuss ; second , we assure that the exact solutions will be known to us , and third , we should be able to solve exactly the stability problem",
    ". this last condition is fulfilled because eq .",
    "( [ a:4 ] ) is a schrdinger equation with a pschl - teller potential@xcite .",
    "the solution of this spectral problem can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in our case we were lucky enough to obtain exact solutions to perturbations that are generic and topologically equivalent to well - known perturbation models ( e.g. the pitchfork bifurcation ) .",
    "let us consider a space - time - dependent force @xmath36 beside the space - dependent forces @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",
    "in a previous work @xcite , gonzlez and hoyst found that if @xmath36 has a spatial shape such that it coincides with one of the eigenfunctions of the stability operator of the soliton , then it is possible to get resonance if the frequency of the force also coincides with the resonant frequency of the considered mode .",
    "therefore we can pump energy only into the traslational mode of the kink selecting a space - time - dependent force of the form @xmath37    in fig .",
    "[ fig.1](a ) we present a sequence of bifurcations of the soliton center - of - mass coordinate @xmath38 ( sampled at times equal to multiples of the period of the driving force ) as the driving amplitude @xmath39 is increased and other parameters remain fixed ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . for these values of @xmath45 and",
    "@xmath46 the stability condition for the translational mode is fulfilled , the soliton moves in a single - well potential and the system is in a regime with three discrete modes ( @xmath27 = 3 $ ] ) .",
    "previous articles have studied the bistable case as well as the single - well case created by inhomogeneities of the type @xmath2@xcite . in this article",
    "we want to stress the complexity of the internal dynamics of the soliton when , besides @xmath2 , there is an impurity of the type @xmath5 .",
    "we have integrated the equation using a standard implicit finite difference method with open boundary conditions @xmath47 and a system length @xmath48 .",
    "we use a kink - soliton with zero velocity as initial condition .",
    "poincar maps for the soliton center - of - mass coordinate have revealed quasiperiodic and chaotic attractors for the non - periodic solutions of fig .",
    "[ fig.1](a ) : period one solutions precede a window of quasiperiodic bifurcations ( the torus entangles as the amplitude of the time - dependent driving force increases ) . at a certain value a period two window appears and is followed by quasiperiodic ( two - tori ) bifurcations . for @xmath49 the poincar maps reveal high - dimensional chaotic motion followed by period one solutions .",
    "the kl decomposition@xcite allows to describe the dynamics in terms of an adequate basis of orthonormal functions or modes .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath50 can be regarded as the weight of the mode @xmath51 .",
    "figure [ fig.1](b ) presents the the greater eigenvalue normalized by the weight , @xmath52 , whereas fig .",
    "[ fig.1](c ) presents the number of modes that contains @xmath53 of the weight .",
    "figure [ fig.2 ] reveals the increasing excitation of the kl modes as the amplitude of the space - time - dependent force increases .",
    "note the sudden changes of the spectra when periodic motion is regained ( period - two for @xmath54 and period - one for @xmath55 ) .",
    "for these solutions the amplitude of the oscillations around the point @xmath12 diminishes even though the amplitude of the driving force has increased .",
    "this agrees with the higher contribution to the dynamics of the few modes of shape whereas all the rest of the modes decreased their contribution .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath55 the first shape mode replaces the translational mode as the leading mode of the dynamics .",
    "the inset of the figure [ fig.2 ] presents the leading kl eigenmodes for the period - one solutions that initiates and ends the sequence of bifurcations considered in this section .",
    "the eigenmode for @xmath56 appears to be the superposition of a pair of translational modes centered at the equilibrium points for the soliton .",
    "similar situation occurs for @xmath57 but the eigenvalue appears to be the superposition of a pair of shape modes ."
