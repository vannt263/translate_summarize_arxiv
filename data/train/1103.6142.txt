    "the experimental and theoretical investigations of reaction dynamics connected with the formation of composed system is nowadays the main subject of the nuclear reactions . at the first stage of reaction of heavy ion collisions the full momentum transfer can occur ( this event is defined as capture ) if there is a well in the nucleus - nucleus potential in dependence on the values of relative kinetic energy and friction coefficients @xcite . at capture , the two reacting nuclei form a rotating nuclear system at near coulomb barrier energies . during its evolution",
    "this system can be transformed into compound nucleus or it re - separates into two fragments which may differ from the initial nuclei in the entrance channel @xcite . during the evolution of dns",
    "its two nuclei may change their masses @xmath3 , @xmath4 and charges @xmath5 , @xmath6 but with constant total mass @xmath7 and charge @xmath8 . the dns should overcome the intrinsic fusion barrier @xmath9 ( it is equal to the difference between the maximum value of the driving potential and its value corresponding to the initial charge asymmetry ) to reach the compound nucleus state through more mass asymmetric configurations .",
    "the intense of the break up of dns into two nuclei ( quasifission channel ) in competition with the complete fusion is characterized by the value of the quasifission barrier @xmath10 ( the depth of the pocket in the nucleus - nucleus potential ) @xcite .",
    "the mass asymmetry parameter of quasifission fragments may be larger or smaller than that of nuclei in the entrance channel .",
    "it is well known the case of the quasifission with small mass asymmetry in comparison with one of initial nuclei . in this case",
    "the maximum of the mass distribution of quasifission fragments places between the masses of projectile ( or target ) and symmetric fission fragments .",
    "on the other hand , due to the exchange with neutrons and protons between the nuclei constituting the dns the mass asymmetry parameter increases being larger than the mass asymmetry in the entrance channel ( evolution to complete fusion direction ) and at the same time there is also a relevant probability of dns to decay into two nuclei .",
    "the decay probability depends on the excitation energy and quasifission barrier @xmath10 of dns at a given configuration .",
    "of course , the mass distribution of quasifission products are related to the characteristics of the entrance channel ( beam energy and orientation angles of the axial symmetry axis of reacting nuclei ) .",
    "the capture events surviving quasifission populate the complete fusion channel .",
    "consequently , the deformed mononucleus may reach the fully equilibrated statistical shape of the compound nucleus ( cn ) , or if there is no the fission barrier @xmath11 the system immediately decays into two fragments ( fast fission process ) .",
    "the latter phenomenon occurs only at high angular momentum @xmath12 for which the fission barrier of the complete fusion system disappears ( @xmath13= 0 ) .",
    "therefore , the fast fission process takes place only in the reactions at high angular momentum values ( @xmath14 ) while the quasifission process takes place at all values of @xmath12 contributing to the capture reaction .",
    "finally , in the last stage of nuclear reaction , the formed cn may de - excite by emission of light particles or undergoes to fission ( producing fusion - fission fragments ) .",
    "the reaction products that survive fission are the evaporation residues ( er)@xcite . the registration of er is clear evidence of the compound nucleus formation , but generally the determination of er s only it is not enough to determine the complete fusion cross section and to understand the dynamics of the de - excitation cascade of cn if the fission fragments are not included into consideration . on the other hands ,",
    "it is difficult for sure correct determination of the fusion - fission rate in the cases of overlapping of the mass and angle distributions of the products of different processes ( quasifission , fast fission and fusion - fission ) because sorting out the registered fissionlike fragments according to the mechanism of its origin is connected with some assumptions .",
    "moreover , by observing the fission products of fissile nuclei formed in the in neutron ( or very light particles)-induced reactions with the heavy targets one can conclude that the low excited compound nucleus ( at about @xmath15 10 mev ) decays into very asymmetric fission fragments ( near to the shell closure ) , while the compound nuclei formed in heavy ion collisions at intermediate or high excitation energy ( @xmath16 20 mev ) undergo fission forming the mass symmetric fragments . starting from these general observations some researchers put forward the idea that the complete fusion process of two colliding nuclei may be considered as the inverse process to fission .",
    "the authors of the papers @xcite argued that since the fission of a compound nucleus in heavy ion collisions produces just symmetric fragments , then in the collisions of two symmetric ( or almost symmetric ) nuclei complete fusion has to be a very probable process . but , unfortunately this is not true . for systems of colliding nuclei heavier than @xmath17pd+@xmath17pd",
    "the fusion does not occur absolutely , while for the reactions like @xmath18mo+@xmath18mo , @xmath19zr+@xmath19zr , @xmath19zr+@xmath18mo , @xmath18mo+@xmath17pa or induced by projectiles higher than zn , ge , kr there is a strong hindrance to fusion .",
    "following the previous reasons one can affirm that the hypothetical @xmath20sn+@xmath21cd reaction should lead to the @xmath22cf cn since @xmath21cd ( with @xmath23=48 near the shell closure 50 ) and @xmath20sn ( with double shell closure @xmath23=50 and @xmath24=82 ) are produced with highest yields in spontaneous fission of @xmath22cf .",
    "but our estimation for this reaction does not give meaningful fusion probability ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the simple reason resides in the peculiarities of the reaction dynamics . in the spontaneous fission of @xmath22cf the average value of angular momentum distribution of the fragments",
    "is close to zero , but if we want to reach the @xmath22cf compound nucleus , by the hypothetical @xmath20sn+@xmath21cd reaction ( or by the realistic @xmath20sn+@xmath26cd reaction leading to the @xmath27cf cn ) , the average value of angular momentum distribution of dns in the entrance channel may be about @xmath28 or higher by increasing the beam energy .",
    "the @xmath29 value is calculated as    @xmath30    in the fusion reaction mechanism , at the first stage , dns which is formed after capture of projectile by the target nuclei should survive quasifission ( re - separation of nuclei of dns ) . due to the hindrance connected with quasifission for these system",
    "the fusion probability @xmath31 should be lower than 10@xmath32 for small values of angular momentum .",
    "this low probability of complete fusion becomes more lower for the excited and fast rotating deformed mononucleus which undergoes fast fission before the system can reach the compact shape of compound nucleus .    also in the cases of the explored @xmath33ne+@xmath34cf ( more mass asymmetric system ) , @xmath35mg+@xmath27 cm , @xmath36si+@xmath37pu , @xmath38s+@xmath39u , and @xmath40ar+@xmath41th ( less mass asymmetric system ) reactions ,",
    "the compound nucleus @xmath42hs is formed with different angular momentum distributions in dependence on entrance channels even the defined excitation energy @xmath43 has been achieved .",
    "therefore , such compound nuclei decay by different yields of reaction products .",
    "the fusion - fission fragment mass distributions are peaked at around the @xmath44xe nucleus with different dispersions and average angular momentum distributions in connection with the various entrance channels .",
    "if we calculate the formation probability of the @xmath42hs compound nucleus in the mass symmetric @xmath44xe+@xmath44xe reaction at the same fixed excitation energy @xmath45 as in the considered @xmath33ne+@xmath34cf reaction ( where @xmath46 1 ) , we do not meaningfully reach such a compound nucleus(@xmath4710@xmath48 ) .",
    "the angular momentum distribution for the @xmath44xe+@xmath44xe collision at the capture stage is completely different and all conditions of reaction dynamics lead to deep inelastic and quasifission products .    in this context , for the @xmath44xe+@xmath20sn ( @xmath4710@xmath49 ) and @xmath20sn+@xmath50yb ( @xmath475@xmath5110@xmath52 ) reactions , one can observe the same above - described hindrance to complete fusion .",
    "our theoretical capture cross section @xmath53 includes all damped reactions , excluding deep inelastic collisions ( dic ) .",
    "the partial capture cross sections are contributed by the full momentum transfer events corresponding to the trapping into a pocket in the nucleus - nucleus potential after dissipation of the relative kinetic energy .",
    "differently , the dic events are not characterized by the full momentum transfer and collision paths are not trapped in the pocket of the nucleus - nucleus potential .",
    "the dic events are not connected with any pocket of a potential ; for example at large values of @xmath12 there is no pocket but the dic events take place .",
    "the partial capture cross section is calculated by the following formula    @xmath54    with the capture probability @xmath55 which is found by the solution of the motion equations @xcite .",

    "[ seconda ] we present an example of capture events with different potential wells and its dependencies on the angular momentum and orientation angles of axes of reacting nuclei ; moreover , in figures we also present the cases of capture and dic events by changing the beam energies and angular momentum values .",
    "the lifetime of an excited dns for a given reaction depends on the initial collision energy @xmath61 and angular momentum distribution values ( see formulae ( 6)-(8 ) and fig.4 of our paper ) .",
    "the mass and charge , as well as shapes of nuclei constituting the dns are changed during interaction time .",
    "the evolution of dns depends on its excitation energy , orientation angles of the axial symmetry axes and shell structures of reacting nuclei . during its evolution dns",
    "can evolve to complete fusion or can decay into two fragments ( quasifission process ) .",
    "the competition between these two processes is related to the values of intrinsic fusion barrier @xmath9 and quasifission barrier @xmath10@xcite depending on the peculiarities of reacting nuclei , beam energy and angular momentum distribution .    in many cases and conditions",
    "the mass and angular momentum distributions of quasifission fragments can overlap with the mass and angular distributions of fusion - fission fragments , or / and with the ones of the fast fission fragments@xcite , leading to the real difficulties in the experimental analysis in order to sort out the true yields of fragments belonged to various reaction mechanisms ( see for example @xcite and fig .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "[ figjpcs3 ]    usually , in reactions with actinides the maximum of the yield of the quasifission products is observed in the mass region between masses of the projectile - like products and symmetric masses . in the @xmath0ca + @xmath62pb reaction ,",
    "the maximum of the quasifission products is very close to the region of projectilelike and targetlike fragments ( see fig . 3 of ref .",

    "i.e. _ projectile has been trapped into potential well ( see fig .",
    "[ prima ] ) .",
    "it is difficult to separate without uncertainty products of these two processes in experimental data . to demonstrate the importance of this circumstance",
    ", the mass distributions of the deep - inelastic and capture reactions were calculated by the method developed on the basis of the dns concept @xcite .",
    "the results for the @xmath0ca+@xmath27pb reaction are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4mpla ] .",
    "the reason of this result can be seen from the driving potential which has a deep valley around initial charge asymmetry due to the nuclear shell effects .",
    "therefore , the sufficient part of the yields of quasifission and deep - inelastic products are mixed in the mass and charge distributions .",
    "the difference between them is in their angular distributions which are connected with the lifetime of the formed rotated dns .",
    "the overlap of the maximum of the mass distribution of quasifission with that of the deep inelastic collisions can lead to conclusion that there is no the contribution of the quasifission process in the total reaction cross section .",
    "this explains the strong deviation of the theoretical values of the capture cross section at low energies from the experimental capture cross section which was determined by the symmetric fragmentation only .",
    "so , the mixing of the mass distributions of the deep inelastic collisions and quasifission processes causes an ambiguous determination of the capture cross section from the experimental mass distributions in case of reactions with magic or double magic nuclei , like to the case of the reaction under discussion . as well as the mixing of the mass distributions of the quasifission , fast fission and fusion - fission reactions makes difficult the estimation of the complete fusion cross section leading to the genuine compound nucleus .",
    "due to the strong dependence of the mass distribution on the peculiarities of nuclear shell structure , the proportion of mixing is changed from one reaction to another reaction .",
    "the theoretical study of this problem is useful to establish the reactions and beam energies which are favorable to obtain the maximum cross section of formation of the compound nucleus with the relatively low angular momentum and excitation energy .",
    "we can state that , at the low energies , the products of the symmetric fragmentation in the @xmath0ca+@xmath62pb reaction are generally formed at usual fission of cn , and therefore they are related to the fusion cross section . at energies",
    "@xmath63 mev the contribution of the fast fission appears and it increases by the beam energy .",
    "that will be shown in fig .",

    "[ figjpcs2 ] shows the mass distribution of the quasifission products of the @xmath0ca+@xmath64sm reaction as a function of the dns lifetime , following the capture reaction at two @xmath61 energies of 140 mev ( panel ( a ) ) and 160 mev ( panel ( b ) ) . at lower energies ( panel ( a ) ) the mass distribution of quasifission fragments are asymmetric ; at higher beam energy ( panel ( b ) ) , also appear mass symmetric quasifission fragments .",
    "the latter mass distribution of quasifission fragments overlap to the fusion - fission mass distribution leading to a relevant uncertainty in experimental determination of the fusion cross section .    in fig .",
    "[ figjpcs3 ] we present the results of the @xmath0ca+@xmath64sm reaction regarding the determination of the rotational angle @xmath65 of the dinuclear system at two @xmath61 beam energies of 138 and 154 mev ( see panels ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively ) versus the angular momentum @xmath66 values of dns , and the angular distributions of the quasifission @xmath67cr and @xmath68ce fragments at decay of dns for the energies @xmath61=138 and 154 mev , ( see panels ( c ) and ( d ) , respectively ) .",
    "as one can see , at @xmath61=138 mev the decay of dns into the two mentioned fragments lead to large rotational angle @xmath65 at intermediate and high angular momentum components ( panel ( a ) ) as well as a wide angular distributions of the quasifission @xmath67cr and @xmath68ce fragments at all dns rotational angles ( panel ( c ) ) ; while , at high energy @xmath61=154 mev , the rotational angle @xmath65 is small up to large angular momentum values ( panel ( b ) ) , and the angular distribution of the quasifission fragments is strongly peaked to low rotational angle values of dns ( panel(d ) ) .",
    "this means that at @xmath61=138 mev for @xmath69 35@xmath70 the rotation angle is enough large and the angular distribution of the quasifission fragments may be nearly isotropic .",
    "the maximum of the angular distribution moves to small angles at larger energies : @xmath61=154 mev the most part of fragments is distributed to the forward angles and to backward angles for the relative fragment - partner ( see panel ( d ) ) , and the maximum of the angular distribution are concentrated around @xmath65 = 15@xmath71 in the center - of - mass system .",
    "therefore the large part of quasifission fragments passes beside the nearest to the beam detector .",
    "this phenomenon caused the conclusions of the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite about decreasing of quasifission events at energies @xmath72154 mev .",
    "the reason of decreasing in the experimental events of quasifission at low energies @xmath73138 mev is the isotropic angular distribution of some part of quasifission fragments which were considered as the compound nucleus fission fragments .",
    "the composite system formed at capture stage evolves by exchanging nucleons between the two nuclei constituting the dns . during its evolution",
    "the dns can reach the shape of a deformed mononucleus ( complete fusion ) or it can break up into two fragments ( quasifission ) without reaching the complete fusion stage . in the first case",
    "the nuclear system has to reach the statistical equilibrate shape of the cn with the angular momentum @xmath74 .",
    "the equilibrium shape of compound nucleus depends on the value of @xmath75 which determines the fission barrier @xmath11 providing its stability against to fission .",
    "it is well known that @xmath11=0 if the value of @xmath75 is larger than its critical value @xmath76 for the compound nucleus with the given mass and charge number @xcite .",
    "therefore , the events of complete fusion for @xmath76 can not reach the equilibrium shape of cn because the mononucleus immediately decays into two fragments . this fissionlike process is called fast fission because compound nucleus is not formed .",
    "competition between complete fusion and quasifission occurs at all values of the orbital angular momentum .",
    "therefore , the partial capture cross section is contributed by the following terms : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the partial fusion cross section and @xmath79 is fusion probability as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "it is clear that the fusion cross section in formula ( [ s_fus ] ) includes the cross sections of evaporation residue and fusion - fission products .",
    "the fusion cross section , for each orientation angles of the symmetry axes of the deformed reacting nuclei , is obtained by formula @xmath80 therefore , taking into account the contributions of all configurations with the orientation angles of the symmetry axes of the deformed reacting nuclei we can calculate the averaged value of the fusion cross section by formula : @xmath81 when both nuclei are deformed nuclei , or by formula : @xmath82 for the spherical projectile and deformed target .",
    "obviously , the quasifission cross section is obtained as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the maximum value of @xmath12 at which the capture events occur .",
    "another binary process which leads to the formation of two fragments similar to the ones of fusion - fission or quasifission is the fast fission .",

    "the analysis of the dependence of the compound nucleus and evaporation residue formation cross sections on @xmath188 shows that the observed yield of evaporation residues in the @xmath0ca+@xmath64sm reaction at the low energies ( @xmath73137 mev ) is formed in the collisions @xmath189 . because the initial beam energy is enough to overcome the corresponding coulomb barrier for the collisions with these orientation angles @xmath188 . only in this case",
    "it is possible formation of dinuclear system which evolves to compound nucleus or breaks up into two fragments after multinucleon exchange without formation of the compound nucleus . at larger energies ( about @xmath190140180 mev )",
    "all orientation angles of the target - nucleus can contribute to @xmath191 and its values are in the 10100 mb range .",
    "at the larger collision energies ( @xmath192158 mev ) the complete fusion still increases but the evaporation residue cross section @xmath191 goes down and its values are in the 10.1 mb range due to the strong decrease of the survival probability of the heated compound nucleus along de - excitation cascade .",
    "this is connected by the decrease of the fission barrier for a compound nucleus by increasing its excitation energy @xcite and angular momentum @xcite .",
    "another phenomenon leading to decrease of @xmath191 at higher energy is the fast fission process which is the splitting of the mononucleus into two fragments due to absence of the fission barrier at very high the angular momentum @xmath193 .",
    "to show the importance of the overlap of mass distribution of quasifission and fusion - fission products in the unambiguous sorting out of events belonging to true fusion - fission process from the ones of quasifission process , we compare theoretical and experimental results of capture and fusion cross section for the @xmath0ca+@xmath27 cm reaction in fig .",

    "the calculated capture cross section ( solid line in fig.[116cf ] ) is in good agreement with the experimental data @xcite for the production of all fragments ( full squares ) , while the theoretical fusion cross section ( dashed line ) is not in agreement with the experimental data obtained assuming the masses of the fusion - fission fragments belong in the ranges @xmath194 or ( @xmath195 .",
    "the presence of the quasifission contribution into measured fusion - fission cross section in the ranges under discussion causes disagreement with the theoretical results . if it is assumed that the experimental fusion - fission events are in the @xmath194 amu interval ( almost close to the @xmath196 value ) , the calculated fusion cross sections ( the dashed line ) will be closer to the new set of the experimental data ( open triangles @xcite in fig.[116cf ] )",
    "indeed , in this case there is an appreciable contribution of the quasifission process ( or a contribution which can not be neglected ) , in addition to the fusion - fission fragment formation .",
    "therefore , the estimated experimental fusion cross section , connected with the new set of the experimental events of fission fragments , still appears to be a little larger than the calculated fusion excitation function at higher excitation energies .",
    "a preliminary calculation of the mass distribution of quasifission fragments for a fixed reaction time @xmath197 of a dns performed in the framework of the model developed on the basis of the dinuclear system concept @xcite , indicates that the fragments of the quasifission process also appear in the mass - symmetric region and are mixed with the fragments coming from the fusion - fission process .",
    "there are three main processes causing hindrances to er formation in reactions with massive nuclei : quasifission , fusion - fission , and fast fission @xcite .",
    "all of these processes produce binary fragments in different stages of reaction .",
    "moreover , the angular and mass distributions of some parts of their products can overlap @xcite .",
    "ignoring this mixing may lead to ambiguity at analysis of the experimental data connected with the binary fragments .",
    "this problem should be studied carefully .",
    "the er formation process is often considered as the third stage of the three - stage process . the first stage is capture  formation of the dns after full momentum transfer into the deformation energy of nuclei , their excitation energy , and rotational energy from the initial relative motion of the colliding heavy ions in the center - of - mass system .",
    "capture takes place if the initial energy of the projectile in the center - of - mass system is enough to overcome the interaction barrier ( coulomb barrier + rotational energy of the entrance channel ) @xcite .",
    "the study of the dynamics of heavy ion collisions at energies near the coulomb barrier shows that complete fusion does not occur immediately in collisions of massive nuclei @xcite .",
    "after formation of the dns , the quasifission process competes with the formation of cn .",
    "quasifission occurs when the dns prefers to break down into fragments instead of being transformed into a fully equilibrated cn .",
    "the number of events contributing to quasifission increases drastically by increasing the sum of the coulomb interaction and rotational energy in the entrance channel @xcite .",
    "another reason for the decreasing yield of er with increasing excitation energies is the usual fission of a heated and rotating cn that was formed in competition with quasifission . the stability of a massive cn decreases due to the decrease in the fission barrier by increasing its excitation energy @xmath198 and angular momentum @xmath12 @xcite .",

    "it is seen from these figures that the quasifission takes place at all values of @xmath12 leading to capture .",
    "the angular momentum distributions of cn formed in these reactions at the excitation energies @xmath20272 and 91 mev are presented in the right panels of fig .",
    "the spin distributions of cn formed in each of these reactions differ mainly by the probability but not by the values of the angular momentum ranges .",
    "this means that the number of cn formed in both reactions under discussion are different , but they have a similar range of the angular momentum @xmath12 .",
    "the vertical dotted lines at @xmath203 in these panels separates the complete fusion ( @xmath204 ) and fast fission ( @xmath205 ) regions of the angular momentum .",
    "the quasifission and fast fission processes produce binary fragments which can overlap with those of the fusion - fission channel and the amount of mixed detected fragments depends on the mass asymmetry of entrance channel , as well as on the shell structure of the reaction fragments being formed .",
    "the suggestion for the experimental studies of the difference between characteristics of the fusion - fission , quasifission and fast fission products can be made when their mass ( charge ) , kinetic energy and angular distributions are explored in detail by dynamical calculations allowing to obtain the relaxation times of these processes .",
    "therefore , the correct estimation of the cn formation probability in the reactions with massive nuclei is a difficult task for both experimentalists and theorists .",
    "different assumptions about the fusion process are used in different theoretical models which can give different cross sections .",
    "the experimental methods used to estimate the fusion probability depend on an unambiguous identification of the complete fusion products among the quasifission products .",

    "@xcite , the complete fusion cross sections are obtained by adding fission cross sections @xcite to the measured data of the evaporation residue cross sections@xcite .",
    "therefore , we can state that the definition of the experimental fusion cross section is similar with the definition of capture @xcite : @xmath214 .    in ref .",

    "this argument is confirmed by our results obtained in the framework of the dns model .",
    "we calculate the total er and fusion - fission excitation functions in the framework of the advanced statistical model @xcite .",
    "by using the above - mentioned method we calculated the capture , quasifission , fast fission and fusion ( formation of cn ) cross sections for the @xmath0ca induced reaction on the @xmath1bk target ( see fig .",

    "therefore , it is necessary to estimate the quasifission , fast fission and complete fusion cross sections by a hopeful analysis of the reaction dynamics before to plan new long beam - time and expensive experiments . because only the fusion - fission and fusion - evaporation yields contribute to the complete fusion cross section . only in the two above - mentioned reactions ( @xmath222zr+@xmath20sn , @xmath223kr+@xmath44xe ) it is possible to observe evaporation residues . for all other reactions listed in table [ tab2 ]",
