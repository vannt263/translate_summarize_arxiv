    "the discovery of several peculiar type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) has drawn the attention both to the photometric and spectroscopic diversity among this class of otherwise homogeneous transients .",
    "the dispersion of the luminosity  decline rate relation @xcite can be explained by an additional correlation between the decline rate and the colour at maximum light @xcite .",
    "hence sne  ia can be arranged into a photometric sequence extending from luminous , blue , slowly declining sn  ia , like sn  1991 t , to normal events @xcite , and finally to sub - luminous , red , quickly declining objects , like sn  1991bg @xcite .",
    "sne ia also appear to form a spectroscopic sequence based on the systematic variations in the flux ratios of several spectral features near maximum light ( e.g. si  ii @xmath65972 , 6355 , see * ? ? ?",
    "the common view is , despite their diversity , peculiar events such as the luminous 1991t - like and sub - luminous 1991bg - like sne  ia , just like the normal population of sne  ia , originate from the thermonuclear explosion of a c / o white dwarf ( wd ) that exceeds the chandrasekhar mass after accreting mass from a companion star in a binary system .    however , there is a group of peculiar sne  ia that challenges the canonical chandrasekhar - mass explosion channel .",
    "the prototype of this class is sn  2002cx @xcite , which shows a peak luminosity significantly lower than that of normal sne  ia , even though its light curve decline - rate parameter is comparable to normal events .",
    "spectra obtained near maximum light resemble those of over - luminous 1991t - like objects ( with a blue continuum and absorption from higher - ionisation species ) , even if a low ejecta velocity ( @xmath7  km  s@xmath3 at the epoch of @xmath8-band maximum light ) points towards a moderate kinetic energy from the explosion @xcite .",
    "the late - time spectra show narrow iron and cobalt lines @xcite , in stark contrast to normal sne  ia at similar epochs .",
    "after the pioneering studies by @xcite and @xcite on sn  2002cx , both new and old sn discoveries have been classified or reclassified as 2002cx - like events , and it has become clear these transients are not so rare .",
    "this class was labelled type  iax supernovae ( sne  iax ) by @xcite , who presented a review on the entire group and defined clear observational criteria to classify a type  iax event .",
    "a variety of explosion scenarios and potential progenitors or progenitor systems have been proposed to explain each event ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein for a recent review ) .",
    "although the leading models for sne  iax are thermonuclear explosion of a c / o wd @xcite , a core - collapse scenario has been proposed at least for sn  2008 ha @xcite , which is the most extreme member of sn  iax class to date .",
    "the latter however is controversial because of the detection of c / o burning products in the maximum - light spectrum of sn  2008 ha @xcite , providing a link to thermonuclear explosions . in principle , the best way to shed light on this issue would be the detection of a progenitor in pre - explosion images .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the detection of a luminous blue source coincident ( at the 0.8@xmath9 level ) with the location of type  iax sn  2012z in _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) pre - explosion images .",
    "although the photometric properties of this object suggest a c / o wd primary plus a he - star companion progenitor system , the explosion of a single massive star has not definitely been ruled out . in this case , post - explosion imaging , obtained after the sn fades away , should help to distinguish between the two models .",
    "for two other sne  iax , no sources were detected in pre - explosion images , but limits were obtained that exclude massive stars as potential progenitors ( sne  2008ge and 2014dt , see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    given the diversity of this sn class",
    ", one may consider the possibility that multiple progenitor channels may lead to the production of sne  iax .",
    "in fact , the forty - some objects classified as sne  iax have a number of similarities , but also noteworthy differences .",
    "in particular , they show a large range in luminosity at maximum , from @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath1214.2  mag of the faint sn  2008 ha @xcite to @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath1218.5  mag of sne  2009ku @xcite and 2012z @xcite .",
    "the ejecta velocities near maximum brightness also exhibit a large spread , ranging from @xmath13 to @xmath14  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "for the majority of sne  iax , there appears to be a correlation between ejecta velocity and peak luminosity , with the higher - velocity objects being also the brighter ones @xcite .",
    "however , sn  2009ku , a low - velocity , high - luminosity sn studied by @xcite , does not follow the trend ( note however that the first spectrum was taken long after maximum and so the inferred ejecta velocity is uncertain , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper",
    ", we present the results of a comprehensive observational campaign of sn  2014ck , which started well before maximum light .",
    "it turns out that sn  2014ck is an outlier among sne  iax , as it mirrors sn  2002cx from a photometric point of view , while the early spectra exhibit extremely narrow spectral lines , indicating very low expansion velocities of the ejecta .",

    "this limit allows us to rule out only the most - luminous wolf - rayet stars as a potential progenitor .",
    "overall , the optical and nir observational features summarised above favour a thermonuclear explosion of a c / o wd for sn  2014ck . a failed deflagration model",
    "@xcite might explain most of its observed properties , from the low peak luminosity and energetics ( see section  [ bolometric ] ) to the spectral characteristics ( see section  [ spec_evol ] ) .",
    "in particular , the moderate @xmath63 production derived for this event and the low expansion velocities are well matched in this scenario .",
    "the failed deflagration is too weak to unbind the wd , leaving behind a gravitationally bound , compact remnant around @xmath64 .",
    "the low ejecta mass of sn  2014ck is partially consistent with that prediction .",
    "the rise time predicted by these models ( see table  4 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is too fast compared to the rise time derived for sn  2014ck ( @xmath65  days , see section  6.2 ) . above all , the modelled burning of a c / o wd via a turbulent deflagration flame produces a homogeneous mixing of elements in the ejecta , with unburned material , partially burned material and fully burned ( to the iron peak ) material throughout the ejecta .",
    "significant mixing in the ejecta was suggested for sn  2005hk by @xcite .",
    "the failed deflagration model was also considered the most probable scenario for sn  2012z by @xcite . on the contrary , for the same event , @xcite pointed out evidence of a layered structure for calcium , silicon and magnesium , which is instead the signature of a detonation .",
    "thus , they suggested that these elements are produced in a detonation phase after the mixing has already occurred and the majority of the iron peak elements have been produced in a previous deflagration phase , i.e. a pulsational delayed detonation ( pdd ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "looking at the velocity distribution of elements in sn  2014ck ( figure  12 ) , the presence of fe  ii features up to high velocities , as reported by @xcite for sn  2012z ( and also for few normal sne  ia ) , seems to suggest a layered structure in the ejecta , arguing in favour of a detonation phase , which might have followed a deflagration . on the other hand , c+o elements and",
    "si  ii are moderately mixed , and one could argue that they would be identified at higher velocities if earlier spectra were available .",
    "moreover , explaining iron - group material in the outer layers is still a challenge for explosion models , even if some results have been obtained within a delayed - detonation scenario ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "so far , several questions are still open , among them the mechanism of transition from deflagration to detonation . to be thorough , it is difficult to explain within pdd models the extremely low photospheric velocity at maximum of sn  2014ck .",
    "we also underline , once again , that the severe blending across the spectra of sne  iax , might prevent secure line identifications , as was detailed by @xcite .",
    "consequently , the derived expansion velocities of the elements is ill constrained , as well as the distinction between a layered or a mixed structure of the ejecta .",
    "the analysis of our extended data set of sn  2014ck can not exclude either the failed deflagration or the pdd models for this event .",
    "in addition , the comparison with other sne  iax highlights that the diversity within this class of transients can not be reduced to a one - parameter description .",
    "this may also imply that distinct progenitors and/or explosion mechanisms are involved , despite the overall similarity of the main observables .",
