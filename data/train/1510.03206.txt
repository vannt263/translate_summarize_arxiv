    "_ internet of bio - nanothings ( iobnt ) _ describes the vision of connecting the networks of biological - nanoscale functional entities , e.g. , bacterial colonies , synthetic and natural cells , artificial implants , with each other and with cyber - networks , e.g. , the internet @xcite @xcite .",
    "the iobnt is expected to significantly extend the coverage of internet of things ( iot ) and enable promising applications such as continuous health monitoring and bacterial sensor - actor networks inside human body .",
    "biological entities naturally communicate with each other by using molecules to encode , transmit and receive information .",
    "this _ molecular communication ( mc ) _ paradigm has been extensively studied in the literature from a communication theoretical perspective to enable the use of the method also by synthetic cells and nanoscale devices and to develop future nanonetwork applications @xcite .",
    "to connect these networks with conventional macroscale networks , thus , to realize iobnt , requires the implementation of seamless interfaces between the molecular and cyber domain @xcite .",
    "this points out the need for micro / nanoscale bio - cyber gateways which can decode the molecular messages , encoded into concentration or type of molecules , process and send the decoded information to a macroscale network node through a wireless link .        in @xcite",
    ", we have comprehensively reviewed the state - of - the - art electrical biosensing approaches in the literature to determine the most promising approaches for designing a molecular communication receiver at nanoscale . based on that study , in this paper ,",
    "we take the first step towards realizing the bio - cyber interfaces and propose the use of silicon nanowire ( sinw ) field effect transistor ( fet ) based biosensors , i.e. , sinw biofets , as molecular antennas which can detect the concentration of received molecules and transduce the molecular signals into electrical form .",
    "the transduction of biochemical signals into electrical signals , with a molecular antenna conceptually depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcreceiver](a ) , would provide the gateway with the capabilities of fast signal processing , and connecting to the cyber - networks through electromagnetic wireless communications , probably operating in the thz - band .",
    "biofets are similar to the conventional fets with the exception of an additional biorecognition layer that is capable of selectively binding the target molecules @xcite .",
    "this layer consists of receptor molecules tethered on the surface of the fet channel , and replaces the gate electrode of conventional fets , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcreceiver](b ) .",
    "binding of ligands with intrinsic charges to the surface receptors results in accumulation or depletion of the carriers on the semiconductor channel , and modulates the channel conductance and current .",
    "hence , the output current becomes a function of the ligand density and the amount of ligand charges .",
    "label - free , continuous and in situ sensing of molecules by not requiring any complicated processes , such as the use of macroscale equipments for readout and processing operations , makes biofets a natural candidate for the molecular antenna unit of a bio - cyber interface gateway .",
    "several ligand - receptor pairs , e.g. , antibody - antigen , aptamer - natural ligand , natural ligand / receptors , have proven suitable for the operation of biofets @xcite .",
    "various types of semiconductors , such as sinw , carbon nanotube ( cnt ) and graphene , can be used as the fet channel , i.e. , transducer channel @xcite . however , the literature is currently dominated by the sinw biofets due to easier and controllable construction of sinws , leading us to focus on sinw biofets @xcite .",
    "although , there is a vast number of experimental works on sinw biofets and a few theoretical studies focusing on the noise sources effective on biofets @xcite @xcite , the literature is lack of a comprehensive model that can enable the theoretical analysis and optimization of these devices from communication perspective . in this study , we develop a deterministic and noise models for the biorecognition and transduction operations of sinw biofets when utilized as molecular antennas exposing to concentration - encoded molecular messages .",
    "the model enables us to analytically derive the snr of the electrical signal at the antenna output , and analyze the effect of various system parameters on the antenna s performance .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the deterministic and noise models for the antenna .",
    "the results of performance evaluation are given in section iii .",
    "finally , section iv concludes the paper .",
    "in this section , we develop a deterministic model for the signal flow from the capture of molecules by the biorecognition layer to the output current in the transducer channel . we also provide models for the main noise sources to derive the snr of the antenna s output current .",
    "we assume that the molecular messages are represented by different levels of ligand concentration .",
    "we begin with the dynamics between the information - carrying ligand molecules and the receptor molecules tethered on the surface of the nw transducer channel . in order to derive analytical expressions",
    ", we make the following assumptions :    * diffusion of ligands are assumed to be fast enough such that the reception is not mass transport limited .",
    "this implies that the ligands are homogenously distributed in the reception space , i.e. , in the vicinity of surface receptors , and each of the receptors is exposed to the same concentration of ligands .",
    "* ligand concentration is assumed to be much higher than the surface receptor concentration such that the ligand concentration in the reception space remains almost constant despite the ligand - receptor reactions taking place .",
    "these assumptions are prevalent in molecular communications studies @xcite , and lead to a pseudo - first order ligand - receptor dynamics , where the first time derivative of the number of bound receptors @xmath0 can be expressed through the following differential equation : @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the intrinsic association and dissociation rate constants of the receptor - ligand complex , respectively .",
    "@xmath4 is the total number of receptors on the biofet surface , and @xmath5 is the ligand concentration in the reception space .",
    "since the mass transport effects on the reaction dynamics are neglected , we can assume that a concentration change in the bulk due to successively transmitted messages from the information source is immediately reflected to the concentration in the reception space .",
    "therefore , we can neglect the transient phase between different levels of ligand concentration such that @xmath6 for @xmath7 $ ] , where @xmath8 is the ligand concentration level in the reception space corresponding to the @xmath9th message , @xmath10 is the transition time from the @xmath11th message to the @xmath9th message in the reception space , and @xmath12 is the symbol duration with @xmath13 being the symbol transmission rate . in other words ,",
    "the biorecognition layer is assumed to be exposed to a constant concentration @xmath8 representing the @xmath9th symbol for @xmath7 $ ] .    given the initial condition @xmath14 with @xmath15 , the solution of the differential equation can be given as @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of receptors at steady - state , i.e. , when @xmath18 .",
    "we infer from this equation that although the ligand concentration level immediately changes in the reception space , it takes a certain time for the receptors to adapt the concentration level of the new message . the time to reach steady - state",
    "is governed by the reaction timescale @xmath19 ; thus , for higher ligand concentrations , the adaptation time of the recognition layer decreases .",
    "the number of occupied receptors at steady - state is given by @xmath20    we assume that the gateway samples the receptor states at steady - state ; thus , the number of occupied receptors corresponding to the @xmath9th message can be given as @xmath21 .",
    "the charged ligands bound to the surface receptors induce opposite charges on the gate of biofet .",
    "the mean amount of charge generated for the @xmath9th message is given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the number of free electrons per ligand molecule .",
    "@xmath24 is the mean effective charge that can be reflected to the gate by a single electron of a ligand molecule in the presence of debye screening .",
    "the mean effective charge of a free ligand electron as observed by the transducer is degraded as the distance between the ligand electron and the transducer increases .",
    "the relation is given by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the elementary charge , and @xmath27 is the average distance of ligand electrons in the bound state to the transducer s surface @xcite , which is assumed to be equal to the average length of receptor molecules , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is the debye length which quantizes the ionic strength of the solution according to the following relation @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the dielectric permittivity of the fluidic medium , @xmath32 is the boltzmann s constant , @xmath33 is the temperature , and @xmath34 is avogadro s number , @xmath35 is the ionic concentration of the medium @xcite .",
    "the induced charges on the gate are translated into the gate voltage through the equivalent circuit of the transducer @xcite @xcite , which is demonstrated in fig .",

    "the induced gate voltage is reflected into a variation in the current flowing through the transducer channel @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the bias current which is assumed to be constant and independent of the gate voltage @xmath57 @xcite ; and @xmath58 is the current resultant from the bound ligands during the reception of @xmath9th message .",

    "the number of occupied receptors fluctuates at any time , even at the steady - state , due to the stochastic receptor - ligand binding dynamics . to derive the resultant current noise associated with the binding fluctuations , we need to express the dynamics with a stochastic model .",
    "the pseudo - first order stochastic dynamics is well described by the following markov chain ( mc ) : @xmath65[\\beta_1 ] 1 < = > [ \\alpha_1][\\beta_2 ] 2\\ , \\ , \\ , \\ldots \\ , \\ , \\,n_r - 1 < = > [ \\alpha_{n_r-1}][\\beta_n ] n_r},\\ ] ] where the states of the mc are denoting the number of occupied receptors .",

    "the corresponding forward equations can be written as @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the probability of being in state @xmath70 at time @xmath71 .",
    "since the receiver samples the receptor states at steady - state , we are interested in the steady - state distribution @xmath72 , which can be calculated by setting all time derivatives to zero : @xmath73 the mean and variance of the number of occupied receptors at steady - state are then given by @xcite @xmath74 @xmath75 equation is exactly the same as the steady - state solution of the deterministic differential equation . the autocorrelation function for the stationary fluctuations at the steady - state can be approximated with a single exponential @xcite : @xmath76 where the characteristic timescale of ligand - receptor binding @xmath19 is also being the correlation time of binding noise .",
    "the fourier transform of gives the power spectral density ( psd ) of the fluctuations : @xmath77    given the noise psd for number of bound receptors , the psd of fluctuations in voltage @xmath78 can be written as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the mean deviation in the gate voltage resulting from binding of a single ligand .",
    "as can be inferred from equations and , the gate voltage noise psd associated with the binding fluctuations is lorentzian with a critical frequency of @xmath81 .",
    "random diffusion of free electrons results in thermal noise on the resistive layer of bound ligands . since the extent of the field effect strongly depends on the distance of the stimulating ligand electrons to the nw surface due to the debye electrolyte screening , the uncertainty in the location of electrons",
    "are reflected into fluctuations in the gate voltage of biofet . using the thermal noise model derived in @xcite ,",
    "the psd of voltage fluctuations on the layer of bound ligands can be expressed by @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the resistance of the layer of bound ligands when the @xmath9th message is received , @xmath84 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath33 is the temperature .",
    "the fluctuations in the voltage across @xmath83 is reflected into the gate voltage through the rc network shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuit ] .",
    "using the transfer function of the rc network , the psd of the resultant thermal noise contribution on the gate voltage can be written as @xcite @xmath85 where @xmath86        the thermal noise associated with the ligand electrons , which is the psd of white noise colored by the rc network transfer function , has also a lorentzian psd with critical frequency @xmath87 .",
    "as in all transistor devices , low - frequency operation of biofet - based molecular antenna is suffered from @xmath64 noise .",
    "although the origin of flicker noise and its full analytical model are still open issues , there are several models , including the well - known hooge s model , that approximate the noise power in frequency domain @xcite .    in this paper , we use the number fluctuation model , which provides a more accurate approximation compared to hooge s model , attributing the source of @xmath64 noise to the random generation and recombination of charge carriers due to the defects and traps in the transducer channel @xcite .",
    "fluctuations due to random generation and recombination of individual charge carriers , which follow lorentzian spectrum , sum up to construct @xmath64 noise .",
    "the model expresses the resultant gate voltage - referred noise psd as follows , @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the characteristic tunneling distance , and @xmath90 is the trap density of the nw channel .",
    "@xmath64 noise is independent of the received signals , and shows an additive behavior on the overall gate voltage fluctuations @xcite .",
    "theoretically , @xmath64 noise does not have a low frequency cutoff , and has infinite power at zero frequency .",
    "however , in experimental studies with a finite measurement time , a finite variance for @xmath64 noise is observed .",
    "the reason is related to the low frequency cutoff set by the observation time @xmath91 @xcite . considering that the received molecular signals are at the baseband , to be able to calculate the total noise power , we assume one - year operation time for the antenna such that the low cutoff frequency is @xmath92hz . at frequencies lower than @xmath93 ,",
    "the noise is assumed to show a white noise behavior , i.e. , @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "the receptor noise resultant from slow receptor - ligand dynamics and the thermal noise resultant from the fast electron diffusion can be assumed uncorrelated with each other , because they are largely separated in the frequency domain @xcite .",
    "therefore , including the additive @xmath64 noise , the overall psd of the gate voltage referred noise can be expressed as @xmath96 gate voltage fluctuations are reflected into channel current noise by @xmath97 , where the transconductance @xmath98 is given in . assuming a resistance of 1@xmath99 for the channel , snr for the antenna output",
    "can be computed by @xmath100    .,width=255 ]",
    "in this section , we provide the results of the simulations for the deterministic and noise model under different settings .",
    "the default values for the main system parameters used in the simulations are listed in table [ table : parameters ] , where the sources of the data are also noted .",
    "the parameter values are selected assuming that the mc is exposed to the physiological conditions , and the receptor - ligand pairs correspond to antigen - antibody , aptamer - dna , or aptamer - protein pairs .",
    "we first evaluate the psd of resultant current noise given in fig .",
    "[ fig : psdtotal ] .",
    "as is seen , the frequency domain is virtually divided into three regions in each of which one of the three noise sources is prevailing . at low frequencies",
    "@xmath101hz , @xmath64 noise is dominating over the receptor and thermal noise .",
    "as the frequency gets higher , the receptor noise becomes dominant around @xmath102 .",
    "the critical frequency of the thermal noise @xmath103 will be on the order of @xmath104khz for the settings given in table [ table : parameters ] . at frequencies higher than @xmath104hz ,",
    "the power of receptor and @xmath64 noise substantially attenuates , and the noise is dominated by the contribution of the thermal noise .",
    ".simulation parameters [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : parameters ]    as the bandwidth of the received signal is expected to be at most on the order of hz @xcite , it would be sufficient for the gateway to sample the receptor states at not more than @xmath104hz . in this frequency range , we can expect that only @xmath64 and receptor noise would be effective on the antenna performance .",
    "the noise psd is also analyzed for varying ligand concentration ( normalized to dissociation constant @xmath105 ) corresponding to different symbols in the csk scheme .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : psdci ] , the contribution of @xmath64 noise dominating in mhz region does not vary remarkably as the input concentration changes ; however , the contribution of receptor noise becomes more prevailing in lower concentrations .",
    "this is originating from the fact that the variance of number of occupied receptors at steady - state increases for lower ligand concentrations as can be inferred from .",
    "the figure also clearly demonstrates that the critical frequency of the receptor noise @xmath102 increases for higher concentrations as expected .",
    "negligible contribution of thermal noise is not evident in this frequency range .",
    "next , we investigate the effect of different parameters on the snr of the antenna output , which is defined in .",
    "snr for varying ligand concentration corresponding to different symbols is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : snrci ] , which clearly shows that snr is significantly improved with increasing concentration .",
    "however , it begins to saturate at around @xmath106db due to the saturation of the surface receptors for high ligand concentrations .",
    "the effect of ionic strength of the fluidic medium on the output snr is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : snrcion ] .",
    "when the ionic concentration increases above 100mol / m@xmath107 , the debye length decreases below 1 nm resulting in substantial screening of ligand charge .",
    "therefore , snr significantly decreases with increasing ionic strength .",
    "physiological conditions imply ionic concentrations higher than 100mol / m@xmath107 . to compensate the attenuation of snr , receptors with lengths comparable to debye length",
    "should be selected .",
    "we also investigate the effect of receptor length on the snr when the ionic strength is 70mol / m@xmath107 which makes the debye length equal to 1.15 nm . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : snrlr ] , snr in db decreases linearly as the receptor length increases .",
    "lastly , we analyze the snr for varying trap density which is inversely proportional to the purity of the transducer channel .",
    "trap density increases the @xmath64 noise , which is very effective in the frequency range of the antenna s operation . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : snrnt ] , the effect of trap density on the @xmath64 noise , and thus , on the snr , is evident especially for @xmath108ev@xmath109m@xmath110 .",
    "fortunately , experimentally reported trap densities for sinw biofets are on the order of @xmath111ev@xmath109m@xmath110 @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we proposed the use of sinw biofets as molecular antennas to realize bio - cyber interfaces between molecular and macroscale networks for the ultimate aim of enabling the ionbt .",
    "we developed deterministic and noise models for sinw fet - based molecular antennas to provide a theoretical optimization framework .",
    "the results of the performance evaluation revealed high snr values at the antenna output for common system settings , and justified our proposal of utilizing sinw biofets as molecular antennas .",
