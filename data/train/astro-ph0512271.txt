    "it become clear in the last few years that long gamma - ray bursts are associated with the endpoints of massive star evolution .",
    "they occur in star forming regions at cosmological distances @xcite , and are assiciated with supernova - type energies .",
    "the collapsar model explains gamma - ray burst formation via the collapse of a rapidly rotation massive iron core into a black hole @xcite .",
    "the short time scale of gamma - ray emission requires a compact stellar size , of the order of lightseconds .",
    "this constraint leaves only massive wolf - rayet stars as possible progenitors .",
    "however , this poses a difficulty : wolf - rayet stars in the local universe are known to have strong stellar winds @xcite , which lead to a rapid spin - down @xcite  in agreement with the absence of signatures of rapid rotation in the galactic wolf - rayet sample @xcite .",
    "it is the current understanding that the ratio of gamma - ray bursts to supernovae is about 1/1000 , based on about 1 - 2 10@xmath2 observed bursts per supernova in the batse sample @xcite , and a beaming factor of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this implies that about 1 out of 100 wolf - rayet stars produces a gamma - ray burst @xcite .",
    "these low values are thought to support the idea that rather exotic binary evolution channels might constitute the main evolutionary paths towards gamma - ray bursts @xcite , corroborated by the two basic problems of single star models to produce collapsars @xcite : ( 1 ) the spin - down of the stellar core due to magnetic core - envelope coupling @xcite  which is required to understand the slow rotation of young pulsars @xcite and white dwarfs @xcite ; and ( 2 ) the spin - down due to wolf - rayet winds mentioned above .",
    "however , recent single star models have overcome both problems for suitable initial conditions .",
    "the models by @xcite and @xcite avoid problem ( 1 ) by rapid rotation  which keeps the stars nearly chemically homogeneous and thus avoids the formation of a massive envelope  and problem ( 2 ) by choosing a low enough metallicity  which , according to recent evidence @xcite , reduces the wolf - rayet mass loss rates .",
    "these are the first single star evolution models fulfilling the requirements of the collapsar model which are at the same time fully consistent with the slowly rotating stellar remnants in our galaxy .",
    "however , they predict long grbs only for metallicities of about @xmath4",
    ".    in this context , the growing empirical evidence that the long bursts indeed prefer a low-@xmath5 environment is remarkable . while indirect evidence from gamma - ray burst host galaxies is pointing towards low metallicity @xcite , direct metallicity determinations yield sub - solar values down to 1/100th of the solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "while the observational and the theoretical evidence for long gamma - ray bursts occurring at low metallicity needs further confirmation , we are motivated by the findings reported above to explore the consequences of such a possibility .",
    "in order to quantify the amount of star formation at a given metallicity , we use the schechter distribution function of galaxy masses and then substitute in it the well - defined mass - metallicity relation .",
    "we use the mass function and metallicity - mass correlation determined in comprehensive sdss studies and deep surveys . for the mass function",
    "there are fine studies by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and we use the latter here . for the mass - metallicity relation we use the classic studies of @xcite and @xcite . from equation ( 1 ) of @xcite",
    "@xmath6    where @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the fraction @xmath9 of the mass density in galaxies with a mass less than @xmath10 is then @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the incomplete and complete gamma function .",
    "we then choose the galaxy mass - metallicity relation of the form : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are constants .",
    "for simplicity we choose to use the linear bisector fit to the mass metallicity relation derived by @xcite at redshift , @xmath17 .",
    "this is parallel to the quadratic fit of @xcite at low masses and metallicities that we consider here .",
    "the form we derive is very close to @xmath18 and @xmath19 and we assume these values .",
    "this gives a pleasing gaussian form to the metallicity function which may be of more general applicability .",
    "we now derive the fractional mass density belonging to metallicities below metallicity @xmath5 at a given redshift @xmath20 as @xmath21 where we used the average cosmic metallicity scaling as @xmath22 \\over dz } = -0.15 $ ] dex per unit redshift from kewley & kobulnicky ( 2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "we used this scaling since the mean metallicity is given by : @xmath23 and thus the mean metallicity is linearly proportional to @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "the ratio of the gamma - functions in the above equation gives @xmath26 for @xmath27 , and @xmath28 for @xmath18 , assuming @xmath7 in both cases .",
    "our scaling simply gives self - consistently @xmath29 where from kewley and kobulnicky(2005 , 2006 ) we have @xmath30 that we adopt here .",
    "the @xmath31 value found by @xcite is approximately @xmath32 ( s.savaglio , private communication ) .",
    "this ansatz includes various simplifications . because the parameter we need here is a ratio of two moments of the mass function the evolution of the normalisation of the mass function ( the cosmic stellar mass density ) cancels .",
    "the remaining evolutionary term is essentially the mean cosmic metallicity evolution . since we are dealing here with massive star formation from the interstellar medium and since the metallicity constraint is from the physics of line - driven winds we use the scaling with redshift derived from emission - line studies by kewley and kobulnicky ( 2005 , 2006 ) for [ o / h ] .",
    "the study of @xcite derives stellar metallicities and gives in their figure 6 the distribution of stellar metallicity in galaxies at low redshift .",
    "as they note , in general , the stellar metallicity is always lower than the gas - phase metallicity and our use of kewley and kobulnicky s gas - phase evolution is conservative .",
    "we are assuming in these star - forming galaxies that the evolving metallicity distribution we have derived also applies to the ism in which the stars are forming .",
    "for our fiducial numbers @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath19we thus obtain @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "the result of folding @xmath37 with the total star formation rate history is shown in figure  [ sfr ] . here",
    ", the total star formation rate @xmath38 is derived from a 4th - order polynomial fit to the data presented in @xcite .    in order to be able to compare with observations ,",
    "we convolve the fraction @xmath37 of stars born with a metallicity of less than @xmath39 with the comoving volume element of the friedman - robertson - walker metric .",
    "the quantity @xmath40 used below is the proper motion distance for our cosmological parameters .",
    "we are using the standard cosmological parameters of @xmath41km@xmath42s@xmath43mpc@xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .    including the time dilation effect due to redshift that slows the rates with redshift ,",
    "the unbiased observed rate of core collapse supernovae from stars with a metallicity below @xmath39 then becomes @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the number of core collapse events per solar mass of stars formed , where @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the salpeter initial stellar mass function , and @xmath51 is the number of core collapse events per solar mass of star formation .",
    "figure  [ snrates ] shows the resulting supernova rates , and their integrated value , for various values of @xmath0 .    in table",
    "[ tableone ] , we derive the preceived global and local ratios of low - metallicity to all supernovae , for various metallicity thresholds and for two galaxy mass - metallicity exponents . from these ,",
    "we compute formation rates of low - metallicity black holes by assuming supernovae to form from stars above 8@xmath52 , but black holes to form only from stars above 30@xmath52 , which  for a salpeter imf  gives a bh / sn ratio of 0.14 . since black hole formation is only one out of three criteria for grb production within the collapsar frame , our derived numbers give an upper limit to the grb production rate from low metallicities , independent of the stellar evolution scenario considered .",
    "for @xmath53 , this corresponds to less than 22 grbs per 1000 sne globally in the universe , and to less than 3/1000 at low redshift .",
    "this is what stars with a metallicity of @xmath54 and below can provide maximally .",
    "table  1 shows further that the constraint of achieving 1 grb per 1000 sne globally in the universe results in about 1 grb per 10@xmath42000 sne in the local universe .",
    "we note that these numbers seem to be remarkably insensitive to details of the star formation history . the last row in table  [ tableone ]",
    "is computed by using the star formation history shown by @xcite , which is similar to the one used here up to redshift  2 , but which remains at the top level until about @xmath55 ( cf .",
    "their fig .  2 ) .",
    "however , table  1 also shows that the redshift at which the grb rate peaks does depend on the star formation history and can thus not yet be predicted reliably .",
    "to produce a grb , wolf - rayet stars at core collapse are required to have sufficient angular momentum .",
    "stellar evolution models which include magnetic fields predict too slowly - rotating cores for models which develop an extended , massive envelope after the main sequence .",
    "current evolutionary models that include rotation predict extended envelopes for the vast majority of massive stars in the galaxy or magellanic clouds  in agreement with the number of blue and red supergiants @xcite .",
    "only the fastest rotators are thought to be able to avoid extended envelopes , for metallicities below about @xmath54 , or @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "most importantly , the numbers derived for @xmath53 in table  1 appear not to be in conflict with observations . per 1000 supernovae in the universe , 160 are predicted to occur from stars with @xmath56 , out of which 22 would produce a black hole .",
    "thus , producing one grb per 1000 supernovae globally in the universe ( cf .",
    "1 ) seems possible .    on the other hand ,",
    "a large fraction of the 22 black holes may be born without producing a grb : not all of them may occur in wr stars but rather in more extended stars @xcite , and the most massive ones would lose too much angular momentum in a wind , even for metallicities as low as @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "while within the chemically - homogeneous - evolution scenario for grb formation @xcite a grb / bh fraction of 1/20 can certainly be obtained @xcite , this is therefore unlikely for exotic binary channels for grb production  i.e. for channels through which only a small fraction of stars of any initial mass evolves .",
    "clearly , the more the long grbs are confined to low metallicities , the more unlikely it is that binary evolution is needed to explain the majority of events .",
    "the empiric cosmic grb to sn ratio of about 1/1000 ( cf . sect .",
    "1 ) can not directly rule out more extreme values of @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath57 ( cf .",
    "table  1 ) ; in fact , for @xmath58 , about 10% of all massive stars with @xmath59 would need to produce a grb .",
    "however , it would imply that the formation of _ every _ black hole would be accompanied by a grb .",
    "furthermore , the grb rate would peak only at a redshift of about @xmath60 .",
    "a value of @xmath58 appears thus unlikely .",
    "furthermore , our models with @xmath61 produce such a small local grb / sn ratio that they seem to be ruled out .",
    "* grbs do not follow star formation in an unbiased manner .",
    "for example , for an overall star formation rate which predicts a preceived sn peak at a redshift of @xmath64 we find , for @xmath65 , that the grb rate peaks at a redshift of @xmath66 ( fig .  2 and tab .  1",
    "; see also @xcite * local massive galaxies , like our milkyway , are not expected to host long grbs .",
    "the last long grb in our galaxy should have occurred several gigayears ago . * the global and local grb to sn ratios",
    "appear to be insensitive to the details of the cosmic star formation history , while the redshift of the peak grb rate can vary appreciably ( tab .  1 ) .",
    "* the local grb / core - collapse ratio is much smaller than the one obtained from averaging over the universe ; i.e. , by one order of magnitude for @xmath65 ( tab .  1 ) .",
    "* we obtain the expected result that the number of massive stars in the universe with a metallicity below a critical value @xmath0 does roughly scale with @xmath0 .",
    "i.e. , for @xmath65 , we find a ratio of low - metallicity ( @xmath67 ) to total global supernova rates of 0.16 .",
    "further , the probability that a randomly chosen burst has a metallicity of @xmath68 is about 10% .",
    "* we derive the most likely redshift for gamma - ray bursts of specified metallicity for unbiased observations .",
    "for example , for a metallicity of @xmath68  as found for grb050730  , we find grbs to occur most likely at redshifts of @xmath69 .",
    "locally , the ratio of grbs with a metallicity of @xmath68 to all grbs is about 0.02 ( tab .  1 ) .",
    "* the larger the low - metallicity bias of long grbs , the less likely can binary scenarios explain the major fraction of them . *",
    "a confirmation of the low - metallicity bias of long grbs to values of the order of @xmath65 would imply that fast rotation may be much more common at low metallicity among massive stars .",
