    "since the discovery of the dusty disk around @xmath0pictoris  ( aumann 1984 , smith & terrile 1984 ) , it has been the subject of extensive investigations with all possible observational techniques : visible and ir imagery ( smith & terrile 1987 , paresce & burrows 1987 , lecavelier des etangs et al .",
    "1993 , golimowski et al .",
    "1993 , lagage & pantin 1994 ) , spectroscopy ( vidal - madjar et al .",
    "1994 , vidal - madjar & ferlet 1995 and references therein ) and recently photometric variations ( lecavelier des etangs et al .",
    "in particular , the stellar light scattered by dust particles has been well observed by several authors for many years to follow a power law distribution with a slope in the range -3.6 ( artymowicz et al .",
    "1989 , lecavelier",
    "des etangs et al .",
    "1993 ) -4.3 ( smith & terrile 1984 ) .",
    "however , a convincing explanation for this scattered light distribution is still needed .",
    "the dust distribution in the @xmath0pictoris  disk may be a crucial issue for understanding its origin .",
    "we present here a precise dynamical model which will be compared with the observations for the first time in a quantitative manner .    another key point revealed by the spectroscopic studies of the gaseous counterpart of the @xmath0pictoris  disk",
    "is the existence of orbiting kilometer size bodies which sometimes fall onto the star , giving rise to the observed spectroscopic redshifted signatures due to ejected gas , and undoubtedly to dust particles . already in 1984 , weissman ( 1984 ) questioned whether the material around vega - like stars is of cometary or asteroidal origin and suggested that particles could be continually supplied by sublimation or from collisions between larger bodies .",
    "the time scale evaluation over which dust particles are eliminated by the poynting - robertson effect or collisions ( backman & paresce 1993 ) leads to durations much shorter than the estimated age of @xmath0pictoris  ( @xmath1 years according to paresce , 1991 ) .",
    "this simple comparison suggests convincingly that the @xmath0pictoris  disk is not a remnant of planetary formation but on the contrary must be continually replenished by secondary sources like evaporation or collision of small bodies .",
    "this seems in fact a very natural hypothesis ( see for example zuckerman & becklin 1993 ) : the presence of small bodies is a consequence of planetary systems formation ( lissauer 1993 ) .    furthermore , co absorptions have been recently observed towards @xmath0pictoris(vidal - madjar et al .",
    "1994 ) with the hubble space telescope . the very presence of co may also require a permanent source provided by evaporation of comet - like bodies .",
    "here we present a new argument : this replenishment is able to reproduce the main characteristics of the @xmath0pictoris  dust disk , and in particular the spatial distribution of dust at large distances . in detail , it gives possible explanations for the following unexplained issues :    1 .",
    "the gradient of the scattered light follows a relatively well - known but unexplained power law ( e.g. golimowski et al .",
    "the distribution at large distances is obviously not axisymmetric ( smith & terrile 1987 , kallas & jewitt 1995 ) .",
    "the central part of the disk is relatively clear of dust ( backman et al .",
    "1992 , lagage & pantin 1994 ) .",
    "4 .   the disk seems to be a `` wedge '' disk : the thickness increases with radius ( backman & paresce 1993 , lecavelier des etangs et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the slope of the scattered light distribution changes abruptly at about 100  au from the star . if confirmed , this fact remains unexplained ( artymowicz et al .",
    "1990 , golimowski et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "furthermore , the possible explanation of these observational facts could give new understanding to the following questions :    * \\a ) what is the mass of the dust disk , since when extrapolated towards infinite distances the disk mass diverges ( artymowicz et al .",
    "* \\b ) are there connections between the dust and the gas disks ? *",
    "\\c ) can the asymmetry in the observed dust disk be connected with the asymmetry in the longitude of periastron of the comets in the falling - evaporating - bodies ( feb ) model proposed to explain the redshifted spectroscopic events ( e.g. beust et al .",
    "1991 ) ?",
    "therefore , we will consider here a model in which the disk is replenished by a group of kilometer - size bodies ( section  [ model ] ) .",
    "numerical calculations of the spatial distribution of dust are given in section  [ numerical ] .",
    "we shall discuss in section  [ bp disk ] the @xmath0pictoris  disk in such a scenario and summarize the results in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "we assume that the dust is produced by cometary or asteroid - like bodies which create particles through mutual collisions or evaporation processes .",
    "the main assumption is thus that these particles have small initial velocities relative to the parent bodies : less than 1 km / s like in cometary production ( gombosi et al .",
    "1985 , sekanina 1987 ) or in `` chiron burst '' ( luu & jewitt 1990 ) .",
    "thus , these velocities can be considered as negligible in comparison to the orbital velocities . in our model , this relative velocity is fixed at zero . however , as soon as a dust particle is ejected , it is perturbed by the radiation pressure ; its orbit is different from the parent body one and tangent at the point where it was injected ( burns et al . 1979 ) .",
    "for example , if a parent body in a circular orbit with a semi - major axis @xmath2 produces a particle with a ratio @xmath3 of the radiation force to the gravitational force , the particle orbit has a semi - major axis @xmath4 and an eccentricity @xmath5 .",
    "the periastron is @xmath6 and the apoastron @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , particles can be observed at distances from the central star much larger than the apoastron of the parent body .",
    "thus , local perturbations on the distribution of the parent bodies like asymmetries , could produce observable signatures on the dust distribution at very large distances .",
    "furthermore , because the parent bodies should not produce single sized particles , we introduce in the calculation a size distribution . for particles with radius @xmath8 , @xmath9 is correlated with the size of the particle by @xmath10 ( artymowicz 1988 ) .",
    "we can assume a power law size distribution as in solar system cometary dust ( lien 1990 and references therein ) , in collisionally replenished dust ( greenberg & nolan 1989 ) , or in interplanetary medium dust ( le sergeant & lamy 1980 ) .",
    "thus , if we have a size distribution @xmath11 , then we have @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "first , let us consider a parent body in a circular orbit which generates a set of particles at a given point .",
    "then the particles with @xmath14 have hyperbolic orbits and are ejected from the system towards the interstellar medium . the other particles with @xmath15",
    "follow orbits within a parabola which is the orbit of the particles with @xmath16 .",
    "one can evaluate the surface density of particles in the asymptotic direction of the parabola : for a given particle the true anomaly @xmath17 follows the distribution law    @xmath18    in the asymptotic direction @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the probability that the particle apoastron is between @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the same direction is @xmath23 . since @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "thus , taking into account the scattering cross section @xmath26 we obtain the surface density normal to the plane of the disk @xmath27 :    @xmath28    thus @xmath29 .",
    "however , dust production can take place at every point in the orbit of the parent body . here , we restrict ourselves to a parent body in circular orbit , thus , producing an axisymmetrical disk .",
    "each particle has a probability @xmath30 to be at a distance @xmath21 : @xmath31 .",
    "the surface density normal to the plane of the disk is then :    @xmath32    this surface density follows an @xmath33 law and is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "moreover , the inclination of the particles is the same as the inclination of the parent bodies .",
    "therefore , the vertical distribution of the particles depends on the distribution of the inclination of the parent bodies . in the present model the thickness of the disk is increasing with radius and",
    "the volume density ( @xmath34 ) is proportional to the surface density ( @xmath35 ) divided by the distance , i.e. @xmath36 .",
    "it has to be noted that this conclusion is valid at distances larger than the distance of the farthest parent bodies . within this zone",
    "the opening angle must look smaller .    from the @xmath36 law and nakano s ( 1990 ) conclusion concerning the connection between the volume density and the scattering light distribution ( @xmath37 ) , one can conclude that a belt of parent bodies in circular orbits should produce a `` wedge '' disk with a scattered light distribution @xmath38 .",
    "the analytical model of the previous section can only be solved for a limited number of parameters and parent body distributions .",
    "we have chosen to evaluate the dust distribution by a monte - carlo method .",
    "we shall consider a given family of parent bodies , a dust production law and a particle size distribution , and we shall integrate the distribution in the following way :    for each of the @xmath39 random particles , we first randomly select a parent body in the family and its position in its orbit ; then we randomly apply the particle size distribution and we calculate the position @xmath40 of the particle @xmath41 after a time @xmath42 where @xmath42 is randomly chosen between @xmath43 and @xmath44 . finally , we evaluate @xmath45 the surface brightness along the midplane of the edge - on disk projected on the sky at the projected distance @xmath21 . if @xmath46 is the contribution of the particle @xmath41 , from eq .  2 of nakano ( 1990 )",
    ", we have    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the distance to the central star and @xmath49 is the scattering phase function . nakano ( 1990 )",
    "has already shown that , except if the dust is much more steeply forward - scattering than in the solar system , the isotropic scattering assumption does not change the observed slope of the scattered light distribution , thus @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "the volume density is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the production rate of dust on the parent bodies , then @xmath54 where h is the heavyside function .",
    "finally , the surface brightness at a given projected distance @xmath21 from the star is estimated by    @xmath55      results of runs with different initial conditions on the family of parent bodies are summarized in tables  [ resultat_1 ] and [ resultat_2 ] .",
    "the production rates per annulus of fixed width are given for each run .",
    "several configurations have been tried .",
    "the first one corresponds to the analytical model of sect .",
    "[ circular orbits ] , we find again @xmath56 , which validates the monte - carlo model .",
    "in runs # 2 and # 3 , we have tried different distances and evolutionary times which show that the poynting - robertson effect does not change the results : the accuracy for @xmath57 is about 0.1 . from # 4 to # 11 , the parent bodies are in eccentric orbits with eccentricities uniformly distributed between 0 and 0.5 or between 0 and 1 ; it seems that bodies with eccentricities larger than 0.5 do not contribute much to the distribution since a large fraction of ejected material is then on hyperbolic orbits . in runs # 4 to # 7",
    ", we have taken parent bodies with a peculiar longitude of periastron ( @xmath58 ) , namely 155@xmath59 .",
    "this value has been selected according to the beust et al .",
    "( 1991 ) modelisation of the falling - evaporating - bodies , the so - called feb scenario needed to reproduce the spectroscopic redshifted signatures . in the four",
    "last runs of table  [ resultat_1 ] , @xmath58 was uniformly distributed between 0@xmath59 and 360@xmath59 .    from all the results in table  [ resultat_1 ]",
    ", it can be seen that the slope @xmath57 is always greater than or equal to 5.0 . in table",
    "[ resultat_2 ] , we test other parent body distributions in which the dust observed at large distances still is produced close to the star . incidentally , another solution would be to assume that the disk is produced by a distribution of asteroids up to 1000  au from the star .",
    "however this solution does not allow us to explain the observed asymmetries",
    ".    runs # 12 to # 15 take into account the epstein gas drag with a gas density @xmath60 and temperature @xmath61  k. runs # 16 and # 17 are with dust size distribution characterized by @xmath62 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the distribution observed at large distances in @xmath0pictoris  disk is obviously not axisymmetric ( smith & terrile 1987 , kallas & jewitt 1995 ) .",
    "however , relative keplerian motions should remove such asymmetries : for two particles on circular orbits with semi - major axis @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the time needed to put them in opposite side is @xmath65  years if @xmath63 and @xmath64 are in au . with @xmath66  au and @xmath67  au we have @xmath68  years , an extremely short time compared to the age of the system .",
    "thus , any asymmetry should quickly disappear .    as noted above , it is however possible to find the asymmetry observed between the two extensions of the @xmath0pictoris  disk by assuming a peculiar parent body distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ 113 ] ) . runs # 112 to # 115 have been obtained with a peculiar longitude of periastron of the parent bodies ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "we found a brightness ratio between the two extensions of the disk ranging from 2.8 to 4.0 .",
    "this result shows that the observed ratio of sw to ne extension brightness from 1.1 ( lecavelier des etangs et al .",
    "1993 ) to 1.5 ( kallas & jewitt 1995 ) can be reproduced if there is a small additional proportion of bodies with peculiar longitudes of periastron like in the feb scenario .",
    "however , there is another way to obtain the observed asymmetry , namely to assume that bodies with different longitudes of periastron move inwards with different velocities .",
    "for example , if bodies with a given longitude of periastron move more slowly inward , it produces a fainter disk extension with a steeper brightness gradient in one particular direction ( fig .",
    "[ 108 + 115 ] ) .",
    "the total mass of the @xmath0pictoris  disk calculated from optical observations is    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the particle size and @xmath72 the size distribution .",
    "as discussed above we can take @xmath73 .",
    "previously , authors assumed that @xmath71 is independent of @xmath21 the distance from the star .",
    "this assumption is the simpler one and others must be justified .",
    "this means however that :    @xmath74    the second integral diverges towards the largest bodies ; the first one also diverges for @xmath75 if the slope of the scattering light is @xmath76 ( that is the case according to artymowicz et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , lecavelier des etangs et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and for golimowski et al.s ( 1993 ) ne extension ) .",
    "thus to evaluate the mass , an arbitrary limit for the disk extension and particle size must be fixed .    in the framework of our model both problems",
    "are directly solved . at a given distance @xmath21",
    ", we have @xmath77 where @xmath2 is the distance of the parent body to the star and @xmath78 is defined by @xmath79 .",
    "we saw in section  [ size ] that @xmath78 can be assumed to be constant .",
    "we obtain    @xmath80    @xmath81    this integral now converges and the computed mass is of the order of few lunar masses , i.e. of the same order as the lower limit evaluated by artymowicz et al .",
    "( 1989 ) who assumed an arbitrary outer limit of 500  au and single - size particles of @xmath82 .",
    "this mass is consistent with the total mass deduced from submillimeter observations ( zuckerman & becklin 1993 ) .",
    "one can investigate the connection between the dust observed around @xmath0pictoris  since 1984 and the gas disk with its stable component thanks to the recent detection of co in uv lines with the hst ( @xmath83  @xmath84 , vidal - madjar et al .",
    "the very presence of co may also need a permanent replenishment naturally provided by evaporation of comet - like bodies .",
    "we can evaluate the total mass of dust @xmath85 which is associated with the evaporation of co :    @xmath86    where @xmath87 is the total mass of co in the disk , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the mass ratios of dust to gas and gas to co , @xmath90 is the mass ratio of the dust produced effectively kept in the disk and @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the life time of dust and co : due to photodissociation by uv interstellar radiation @xmath93  years ( vidal - madjar et al .",
    "1994 ) , and at a distance of 100 au where co begins to be vaporized , @xmath94  years ( backman & paresce 1993 ) . from the upper limit to particle size ( @xmath95 ) , one can evaluate @xmath96 . with a simple geometry of a disk with an opening angle of 10@xmath59",
    ", we can deduce from the observed co column density a total co mass of about @xmath97  kg . from observations in the solar system , we can take @xmath98 ( newburn & spinrad 1989 ) .",
    "finally , @xmath99 depends on the composition of the evaporated gas ; it is between 1 . if only co is present and @xmath100 if all volatiles evaporate ( mumma et al . 1993 )",
    "thus , with @xmath101 , @xmath85 is about one lunar mass , that is of the same order as the total mass of the dust disk independently evaluated !",
    "this rough calculation shows that co and dust are compatible with a common origin and produced by the same process : evaporation of comet - like bodies at large distances from the star .",
    "the model we have proposed is able to account for the main characteristics of the @xmath0pictoris  disk as natural consequences of the production of secondary origin particles by small bodies .",
    "it is in fact an answer to the question 3 of zuckerman & becklin ( 1993 ) : are the dust grains primordial or continually replenished ?    indeed , we have shown that if bodies produce dust particles with a given size distribution , these particles follow very eccentric orbits .",
    "thus , a disk can be seen at large distances from the star , and the spatial distribution of dust is very close to a power - law .",
    "moreover , the particles have the same inclinations as the parent bodies : the thickness of the disk thus increases with radius , and the disk is a `` wedge '' disk : ( issue 4 ) . the asymmetric spatial distribution can be explained if we assume that the parent bodies distribution is not axisymmetric ( issue 2 ) .",
    "this assumption is not surprising since asymmetry is observed for the febs and is probably the case in the solar system for kuiper belt objects trapped in planetary resonances ( jewitt & luu 1995 ) . since particles are produced with periastrons greater than or equal to those of the parent bodies , the dust present close to the star is either produced there or brought in by poynting - robertson drag : the central part must be relatively clear ( issue 3 ) .",
    "finally , this model gives connection between the particle size and their distances from the central star , and enable us to solve the issue of the disk mass ( issue a ) , section  [ mass ] ) .",
    "thus , the issues 2 ) , 3 ) , 4 ) and a ) listed in section  [ intro ] are simultaneously solved with the simplest form of the model presented here .    however , in order to explain the flatter gradient observed in the @xmath0pictoris  disk than the one obtained without additional hypothesis , we propose to add two other assumptions : + 1 ) the dust is produced by evaporation of bodies of few kilometers in radius , so that there is a balance between evaporating gas drag and gravitation of these parent bodies , and only the smallest particles are extracted .",
    "+ 2 ) these bodies are moving slowly towards @xmath0pictoris , so that they become extinct before arriving close to the star where the evaporating rate is large enough to produce the largest particles .",
    "+ this oeb ( orbiting - evaporating - bodies ) scenario is proposed to solve issue 1 ) , but surprisingly it is also able to explain the abrupt change in the slope by the cutoff in distribution of particle size ( issue 5 ) ) .",
    "it has to be noted that the cutoff must not necessary be very sharp and in fact is rather smooth in the model since we assumed a parent body size distribution .",
    "the model gives also a natural connection between the dust and gas disks ( issue b ) : they may well be produced by the same bodies in the same process .",
    "the connection between the feb and asymmetry in the disk seems to be possible ( issue c ) ) , however this point needs further analysis .",
    "this new model is able for the first time to explain simultaneously these issues , but we must now ask if other models or hypothesis can also be made with the same consequences . if correct , this oeb scenario allows to see the @xmath0pictoris  disk as a gigantic multi - cometary tail with all its components : gas and dust .",
    "we would like to express our gratitude to dr .",
    "f.roques who first recall us that ejected particles follow peculiar eccentric orbit .",
    "we are particularly indebted to the anonymous referee for his very useful comments which substantially improved the paper .",
