    "if one considers the problem of the `` time of arrival '' of a light signal coming from an extended source ( a two - surface ) and arriving at an observer who is moving along an arbitary time - like world - line , one normally invokes fermat s principle of least time to determine the path of the light - ray from each point on the source to the observer . we will discuss a different but related issue - at each source point",
    "there is a light - cones worth of rays that are emitted and the question is what are the directions of the rays for them to have the earliest `` time of arrival '' at the observer .",
    "stated in a different manner , if the source suddenly lights - up , then from each point there will be a sphere s worth of rays leaving it resulting in a pulse arriving at the observer from different source points with a leading edge followed by a tail .",
    "the question then is which rays arrive earliest ? from the start we assume that the paths of the rays are given by null geodesics , so that there is no need to invoke fermat s principle . in flat vacuum space - time",
    "it is clear that it is the normal rays that arrive earliest , i.e. , they travel the shortest distance .",
    "however in a lorentzian manifold with a time varying metric the issue is not as obvious .",
    "the problems are that there is no well defined distance between source and observer , the rays can bend and be focused by the field and could even cross or even more than one ray could arrive at the observer from the same source point .",
    "nevertheless we will show that it is the rays that are emitted normal to the source that are the ones that arrive earliest , i.e. , the time of arrival function is extremized by the normal rays .",
    "we will give two alternative proofs of this .",
    "the first proof , given in sec.ii , involves a modification of the beautiful derivation by schrodinger of the gravitational frequency shift while the second proof , in sec.iii , uses the theory of generating families of v.i .",
    "arnold .",
    "probably the most powerful technique for the study of wavefronts and their related characteristic ( or null ) surfaces in lorentzian space - times and the associated difficulties in the analytic description of the development of caustics and crossover regions is arnold s theory of lagrangian and legendre submanifolds and the associated lagrange and legendre maps@xcite .",
    "one of the main ingredients in this theory is the construction of what has been referred to as generating families . they are , in general , two - point functions , f(x , s ) ( chosen from , perhaps , different spaces , x and s , with perhaps different dimensions ) , that are to be constructed from physical arguments and which are stationary with respect to variations in one of the two different spaces . in our case",
    "we give an example of this construction where the two - point function is the time - of - arrival function of light rays which begin from points on a two - surface , embedded in a four dimensional space - time , ( thought of as a source of radiation ) , and which end at points on a one - dimensional manifold , a curve ( thought of as the world - line of an observer of that radiation ) also embedded in the same four - space .",
    "though we will not amplify on it here , this example appears to be , in principle if not in practice , of generic use in the theory of gravitational lensing in any lorentzian space - time .",
    "we are concerned with the travel time of light signals from an extended source to a localized observer . for our purposes ,",
    "the source lights up instantaneously , in its own rest frame , emitting photons in all directions from every point on its ( closed ) surface .",
    "there is one photon that arrives first at the observer s location , in the observer s proper time .",
    "if the metric is stationary , then this photon is , intuitively , the one that takes the shortest spatial path , perpendicularly to the surface of the source . in the following",
    ", we make these notions more precise , extending them to the case of arbitrary metrics .",
    "consider , in an arbitrary lorentzian four - dimensional manifold , a given closed space - like two - surface , @xmath0 , described by @xmath1 where @xmath2 are space - time coordinates in the neighborhood of the source , and @xmath3 parametrize the surface @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , consider a timelike worldline , @xmath4 . in the neighborhood of the worldline , with no loss of generality ,",
    "let the local coordinates be such that @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 where the @xmath6 are three constants , the spatial location of the observer , and @xmath7 is the proper time along the worldline .    from each point @xmath8 of @xmath0 ,",
    "construct its future lightcone , @xmath9 .",
    "in general , in the absence of horizons , the line @xmath4 intersects each @xmath9 at least once . the intersection takes place at a particular value of the proper time @xmath7 for each point @xmath10 on the surface .",
    "this means that there is a two - point function @xmath11 that represents the proper time of arrival at @xmath12 of light signals from @xmath13 .",
    "one explicit way of constructing such a function is as follows .",
    "the lightcone @xmath9 is foliated by light - rays from the point @xmath14 , which are solutions @xmath15 of the geodesic equation with initial data labeled by the initial point @xmath16 and the initial direction @xmath17 of the ray . here",
    "@xmath18 can be thought of as an affine parameter along the null geodesics .",
    "the intersection of the lightcone with the worldline @xmath12 takes place at points where @xmath19 and the time ( @xmath20 ) at which the lightray reaches the observer is @xmath21 where the values of @xmath22 in the right - hand side are restricted by ( [ inters ] ) . in cases where ( [ inters ] ) is invertible for every value of @xmath8 , it provides @xmath23 as functions of @xmath24 , which can be inserted into ( [ time ] ) to yield ( [ propertime ] ) .       for large distances between the source and observer",
    ", a worldline intersects any generic future lightcone several times , due to the folds in the individual light - cones produced by space - time curvature ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : multiplicity ] ) .",
    "this is the case where ( [ inters ] ) is not invertible , since for every fixed value of @xmath8 there would be several values of the set @xmath23 corresponding to the same spatial location @xmath6 .",
    "this means that there are several photons , shot in different directions , that reach the observer s location at different times .",
    "therefore , for large distances the function @xmath25 is multivalued .",
    "we restrict attention to such cases where @xmath25 is single valued . in this case",
    ", there exists the following theorem , mentioned in the special case of static space - times by arnold ( see  @xcite , p. 251 , and  @xcite , p. 298 ) :    theorem . _ the proper time of arrival , @xmath26 , at @xmath12 , is extremized by those rays that leave @xmath13 perpendicularly to it .",
    "in other words , the points @xmath8 such that @xmath27 are connected to @xmath12 by light - rays that are normal to @xmath13 .",
    "_    * proof : * the proof is based on the standard variational principle for null geodesics , and is an extension of a similar result in  @xcite . consider the action @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the tangent vector to an affinely parametrized null geodesic between the points @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the affine parameter .",
    "consider the variation of @xmath33 constructed by taking the difference between two neighboring null geodesics with different initial points , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and different final points , @xmath36 and @xmath37 since @xmath33 evaluates identically to zero in both instances , its variation is zero as well , @xmath38 the variation is @xmath39 since the curves are null geodesics , the term proportional to @xmath40 in the integrand vanishes , and we are left with @xmath41 by ( [ zero ] ) and ( [ variation ] ) , we have @xmath42 in ( [ trans ] ) , @xmath43 represents an arbitrary ( up to the condition that @xmath44 and @xmath45 can be connected by a null geodesic ) displacement at @xmath46 and @xmath47 between the null geodesic with tangent @xmath48 and a neighboring one .",
    "we now particularize ( [ trans ] ) to our case of interest , in which , initially , neighboring null geodesics are connected by displacements on the surface @xmath13 ; _ i.e. _ ; @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the two coordinate tangent vectors to @xmath13 and @xmath51 is arbitrary . the final displacement must be tangent to @xmath12 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath52 with @xmath53 the tangent vector to the curve @xmath12 . however , because the two null geodesics arriving at @xmath47 and separated by @xmath54 must be the same pair of null geodesics leaving @xmath46 separated by @xmath55 then @xmath56 is not arbitrary , but @xmath57 with ( [ initial ] ) , ( [ final ] ) and ( [ finaltau ] ) , eq .  ( [ trans ] ) reads @xmath58 since @xmath51 is arbitrary , and since @xmath59 can not vanish as long as @xmath60 and @xmath53 are tangent to a null and a timelike curve , respectively , then ( [ almost ] ) is equivalent to @xmath61    this implies that , at each point of @xmath0 , @xmath62 vanishes if and only if the null ray @xmath60 is normal to the surface at that point .",
    "this proves the theorem.@xmath63    note that since no property of the line @xmath12 was used , the theorem can be restated as follows .",
    "given a time foliation of a lorentzian manifold with local coordinates chosen as @xmath5 , and a source , a closed two - surface that `` lights up '' , the time @xmath64 of arrival at any spatial point @xmath6 , of light signals from a surface point @xmath8 , is extremized by the light - rays leaving the surface perpendicularly .",
    "in the following , we provide an alternative method for obtaining the time of arrival function which is based entirely on the use of the eikonal equation - with arnold s generating families - and specifically on knowledge of a two - parameter family of solutions of the eikonal equation ,    @xmath65    i.e. , it is assumed that a solution , with the two parameters @xmath66    @xmath67    to eq.([a ] ) is known .",
    "then for each value of @xmath68 the level surfaces of @xmath69 are null ( i.e. , @xmath70 is a null covector ) .",
    "furthermore it is assumed that at each point @xmath71 sweeps out the entire null cone at @xmath2 as @xmath68 goes through its range",
    ".    * remark .",
    "* we point out and emphasize that the level surfaces of the solutions to eq.([a ] ) though referred to as `` null or characteristic surfaces '' are not strictly speaking surfaces ; they can have self - intersections and in general are only piece - wise smooth .",
    "though arnold refers to them as `` big - wave - fronts '' we will continue to call them null surfaces .",
    "the intersection of a big wave front with a generic three surface yields a two - dimensional ( small ) wave front .",
    "the first thing that we want to show is that the light - cone , @xmath72 from an arbitrary space - time point @xmath73 can be constructed from knowledge of the function @xmath69 of eq.([b ] ) .",
    "one sees immediately , from eqs.([a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) , that the function @xmath74 defines a two - parameter set of surfaces which all pass thru the point @xmath75 and which , furthermore , are all null surfaces .",
    "the envelope of this family is constructed by demanding that @xmath76 where @xmath77 denote the derivatives with respect to the @xmath78 assuming for the moment that ( [ d ] ) could be solved for the @xmath79 then when they are substituted into ( [ c ] ) one obtains the function @xmath80 using ( [ d ] ) it is easy to see that @xmath81 so that again @xmath82 is a null surface thru the point @xmath83 its gradient at @xmath73 , namely @xmath84 @xmath85spans the light - cone at @xmath73 @xmath86at @xmath87 eq.([d ] ) can not be solved for the @xmath88 all values of @xmath68 are allowed .",
    "] we thus see that eq.([e ] ) represents the light - cone @xmath89 the assumption that eq.([d ] ) could be solved for @xmath90 depended on the non - vanishing of the determinant @xmath91 of the matrix @xmath92 @xmath91 does vanish at the singularities of the `` surface '' @xmath93 e.g. , at the apex @xmath94 in general , however even when @xmath95 , eqs.([d ] ) and ( [ c ] ) can be solved for other variables , namely _ some _ set of _  _ three ( say @xmath96which might be different in different regions ) of the four @xmath97 in terms of the fourth one ( say @xmath98 and the @xmath99 i.e. , @xmath100 note the important point that if the coordinates @xmath2 are such that three of them are space - like and one of them is a time coordinate , @xmath101 then eq.([f ] ) has a stronger version , namely    @xmath102    where the two @xmath103 and the @xmath104 are the three space - like coordinates .",
    "that one can solve for the @xmath105 follows from the fact that eq.([e ] ) can always be solved , from the implicit function theorem , for @xmath106 since @xmath107 satisfies the eikonal equation and hence @xmath108    eqs.([f * ] ) and ( [ f * * ] ) are a parametric representation of @xmath109 via the null geodesics that rule it . for the different given values of the @xmath99 they are the null geodesics thru @xmath110    we thus have the result that the @xmath111can be given either via the surface ( [ e ] ) or by its geodesics ( [ f * ] ) and ( [ f * * ] ) .",
    "we will return to eq.([f * * ] ) later .       if we now allow the @xmath73 to lie on a space - like two - surface @xmath112 described by @xmath113 , parametrized by the two parameters @xmath8 , then the previous construction of light - cones yields the family of light - cones of all the points of @xmath112 via @xmath114 the intersection of the set of all the light - cones with a constant - time slice @xmath115 _ constant",
    ", _ is a family of individual ( small , two - dimensional ) wavefronts emanating from each point on the surface ; they are denoted as `` huygen s wavelets '' . by huygen",
    "s principle , the envelope of all the wavelets , at @xmath115 _ constant , _ is the two dimensional wavefront from the source @xmath116 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : huygens ] ) the evolution , as @xmath106 changes , of these wavefronts yields a new characteristic surface ( big wave - front ) .",
    "it is equivalent to the envelope of the family of light - cones of all the points of @xmath112 ; the envelope corresponding to the stationary variation of the family of light - cones with respect to variations in the @xmath117    more precisely , the envelope is the three - surface defined , first by eqs.([c ] ) and ( [ d ] ) , [ the conditions for the light - cones from @xmath118,$ ] i.e. ,    @xmath119    @xmath120    augmented by the @xmath8 variations , i.e. , by @xmath121 these are five conditions on the eight variables ( @xmath122 thus forming a three - surface in the eight dimensional space ; this when projected down to the space - time results in the aforementioned envelope .",
    "it is easily seen from eqs.([h ] ) and ( [ i ] ) that this surface , which we will denote by@xmath123@xmath124 is a characteristic surface and hence satisfies the eikonal equation , ( [ a ] ) . though almost everywhere it can be given in the form of the vanishing of a function of @xmath97 i.e. , by eq.([j ] ) , there will be lower dimensional regions where it must be given parametrically .",
    "see e.g. , eq.([f ] ) or eqs.([f * ] ) and ( [ f * * ] ) .    before looking at the time of arrival function ,",
    "we first look at eq.([i ] ) more closely .",
    "substituting eq.([g ] ) into eq.([i ] ) and taking the required derivatives we have    @xmath125    which is the statement that for the null ray leaving @xmath112 at the point @xmath126 , @xmath127 must be normal to the tangent vectors @xmath128at @xmath129 and thus normal to @xmath112 .",
    "eq.([k ] ) , hence , chooses among all the rays forming the light - cone at @xmath14 , i.e. , the rays parametrized by @xmath99 just the appropriate @xmath68 so that the ray is the ( unique ) normal to @xmath112 .",
    "we thus have the result that ( [ k ] ) can be solved by    @xmath130    using eq.([l ] ) , we have that eqs.([g ] ) and ( [ h ] ) become    @xmath131    @xmath132    using the same argument that led to eq.([f * * ] ) , namely the implicit function theorem and @xmath133 we see that eq.([g * ] ) is equivalent to    @xmath134    if we take the three @xmath135 as the `` constant spatial position '' of the world - line of sec .",
    "ii , we have the time of arrival function . since , interpreting eq.([g * ] ) as defining eq.([m ] ) implicitly , we have that    @xmath136    which , since @xmath133 implies that    @xmath137    thus the extremization of @xmath107 implies the extremization of @xmath138 as was to be proved . this proof is not affected by the difficulties in sec .",
    "ii of the possible multivaluedness of the earlier @xmath139    in the terminology of arnold , these results follow from his theory of legendre submanifolds and maps , where    @xmath140    from eq.([g ] ) , defines a generating family @xmath141(@xmath142 and eqs.([h ] ) and ( [ i ] ) define the legendre map .",
    "we have given two derivations of a variational principle for the time of arrival of null geodesics at an observer .",
    "superficially , it appears as if it were a version of fermat s principle ; in actuality it is quite different .",
