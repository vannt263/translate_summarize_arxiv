    "recently a family of models for coupled arrays of atom - cavity systems has attracted considerable attention  @xcite .",
    "building on the success of optical lattice experiments in demonstrating the quantum phase transition between superfluid and mott insulator states  @xcite , these proposals have been inspired by experimental advances in photonic crystals  @xcite , optical microcavities  @xcite , and superconducting devices  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , they offer a fascinating combination of condensed matter physics and quantum optics .",
    "much of the work so far has focused on the possibility of creating quantum phase transitions in systems that permit manipulation and measurement of individual lattice sites . on the practical side , several applications in quantum information processing",
    "have already been proposed .",
    "these include generation of entanglement  @xcite , cluster state quantum computation  @xcite , and transfer of a qubit through an array  @xcite .",
    "the simplest version of the coupled - cavity model consists of a series of electromagnetic cavities , each containing a single two - level system ( qubit or atom ) , coupled in such a way that photons may hop between adjacent cavities  @xcite .",
    "another model under consideration uses four - level atoms in a configuration commonly exploited for electromagnetically induced transparency , with each cavity containing multiple atoms  @xcite . the case of several two - level atoms per cavity",
    "has been explored as well  @xcite .",
    "studies have been carried out in the microscopic regime , with only a few cavities  @xcite , as well as the thermodynamic limit , in which the number of cavities goes to infinity  @xcite .",
    "most of the previous work on phase transitions in coupled - cavity systems has emphasized similarities to the bose - hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the four - level - atom model can be mapped exactly onto the bose - hubbard hamiltonian  @xcite ; a two - component bose - hubbard model has also been derived from the four - level - atom system  @xcite .",
    "in other coupled - cavity models , evidence has been found for a quantum phase transition between mott insulator and superfluid states , analogous to that in the bose - hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , our goal in this paper is to identify some of the unique features of the coupled - cavity system . to that end",
    "we have chosen to take a microscopic approach , building up from the well - understood jaynes - cummings model .",
    "specifically , we consider a system of two cavities containing a total of two excitations .",
    "previous work has demonstrated that many - body effects appear in finite systems of only a few cavities , including signatures of the superfluid - insulator phase transition  @xcite .",
    "this holds true even for a two - cavity system .",
    "( for this reason we will use some of the language of quantum phase transitions , particularly the terms `` insulator '' and `` superfluid '' for localized and delocalized states , respectively .",
    "however , it should be understood that in our usage these terms refer to states of a small finite system , not true phases in the thermodynamic sense . )",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the dimension is small enough that exact numerical solutions are easily found and , perhaps more importantly , some analytical approximations can be used . in this way",
    "we hope to identify characteristics of the coupled - cavity system that can be further explored in larger systems as well as in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "one of the principal ways in which the coupled - cavity model differs from the bose - hubbard model is that two types of particles are involved .",
    "the effective on - site repulsion is provided not by a fixed classical potential but by the interaction of photons with the atom(s ) in each site .",
    "this interaction depends not only on the strength of the atom - photon coupling but also on the detuning between their frequencies .",
    "the detuning , then , provides an additional parameter for the system . to further complicate the picture , the fundamental excitations in the absence of hopping are not bosons but rather entangled states of atoms and photons , known as polaritons",
    "the relative weights of the atomic and photonic components of the polaritonic states change with the detuning . as a result , both the effective repulsion and the nature of the particles in the system",
    "depend on the detuning parameter .",
    "in this paper we map out the parameter space of the two - cavity system over a wide range of values for the atom - cavity detuning and the photon hopping rate .",
    "the negative detuning and large hopping regimes , in particular , have not been explored in depth previously .",
    "we identify an interesting insulator - superfluid transition in the limit of large negative detuning , which occurs at a hopping strength equal to the magnitude of the detuning .",
    "the character of this transition is distinctly different from the transition at small hopping and positive detuning studied by angelakis et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "previous studies of coupled - cavity systems have utilized the variance of the total excitation number to differentiate between insulatorlike and superfluidlike states .",
    "we also examine the atomic excitation number variance , which allows us to distinguish between purely atomic or photonic ground states and states that are composed of polaritons . using these two measures",
    "we identify four distinct types of states : polaritonic insulator , photonic superfluid , atomic insulator , and polaritonic superfluid .",
    "in the small hopping limit , the change from atomic insulator to polaritonic insulator to photonic superfluid occurs smoothly as the detuning is increased .",
    "the situation is quite different around the transition in the regime of large negative detuning : the transition from atomic insulator to polaritonic superfluid to photonic superfluid is discontinuous to lowest order in the atom - cavity coupling parameter . this difference highlights the complexity that can arise from the combination of individual atom - cavity dynamics and the coupling between the sites .",
    "in order to keep the complexity of the system to a manageable level , we consider the simplest possible case , consisting of just two identical cavities .",
    "each cavity supports a single field mode and contains a single two - level atom .",
    "photons are allowed to hop between the two cavities .",
    "the hamiltonian for the two - cavity system is given by ( @xmath0 ) @xmath1 + a({\\hat{a}^{\\dag}}_1 { \\hat{a}}_2 + { \\hat{a}^{\\dag}}_2 { \\hat{a}}_1 ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the cavity and atom frequencies , respectively , @xmath4 is the atom - cavity coupling strength , and @xmath5 is the hopping strength . the operator @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the lowering ( raising ) operator for the field in cavity @xmath8 .",
    "the states @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the ground and excited states , respectively , of the atom in cavity @xmath8 . hence the operator @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the atomic lowering ( raising ) operator for cavity @xmath8 .    the first term of eq .",
    "gives the internal hamiltonian for the atom - cavity systems .",
    "individual cavities are described by the jaynes - cummings model , using the rotating - wave approximation  @xcite .",
    "the first two terms in the sum correspond to the internal energies of the field and atom .",
    "the interaction between the atom and the field , given by the third term , contains only so - called `` energy - conserving '' terms , in which an excitation of the field ( atom ) is accompanied by a deexcitation of the atom ( field ) . finally , the last term of eq .",
    "describes the hopping of photons between the two cavities .    in the absence of hopping ( @xmath13 ) the eigenstates of the individual cavities",
    "are given by the polaritonic states @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the cavity number , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is a photon number state , and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the detuning .",
    "the energies of these states are given by @xmath20 the total number of excitations in the system @xmath21 , is conserved .",
    "in this paper the analysis is restricted to the case of exactly two excitations .",
    "there are eight possible states for the system , divided into five subspaces where states in the same subspace have degenerate energies . in order of increasing energy ,",
    "the subspaces are \\{@xmath22 } , \\{@xmath23 , @xmath24 } , \\{@xmath25 , @xmath26 } , \\{@xmath27 , @xmath28 } , \\{@xmath29}. it is important to note that the ordering of the subspaces with respect to energy is always the same regardless of the parameter values .",
    "however , the energy differences between the subspaces change significantly .",
    "figure  [ fig : energy_diagrams ] illustrates the energy levels in the three limiting cases of zero detuning , large positive detuning , and large negative detuning .",
    "having established the model , we next turn to the problem of selecting a measure ( analogous to an order parameter ) that can distinguish between superfluid - like and insulator - like states . for the bose - hubbard model in the mean - field limit",
    "the expectation value of the boson destruction operator is typically used as the order parameter  @xcite . in the mott insulator state",
    "each site contains a fixed number of particles and the expectation value of the destruction operator vanishes , whereas in the superfluid state the particle number per site is not fixed and thus the expectation value becomes nonzero . however , our system is restricted to exactly two excitations . in this case",
    "the expectation value of any destruction operator is identically zero .",
    "therefore we will first look at the `` order parameter '' utilized in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is the variance of the total excitation number in a single cavity .",
    "this quantity neatly captures the essence of the transition . in the insulator state",
    "the number of excitations per cavity is sharply defined and has zero variance .",
    "however , in the superfluid state each cavity has a finite probability of containing any number of excitations , resulting in a nonzero variance .",
    "the two cavities are , of course , completely equivalent ; for definiteness we will work with cavity 1 .",
    "the excitation number in cavity 1 and its variance are defined as , respectively , @xmath30 a contour plot of @xmath31 as a function of the detuning @xmath32 and the hopping @xmath5 for the ground state of the system is shown in fig .",

    "this creates a photon blockade effect , prohibiting additional photons from entering the cavity  @xcite .",
    "the photon blockade leads to a large energy gap between the lowest two subspaces in the two - cavity system [ see fig .  [",

    "when the hopping is weak ( @xmath39 ) , the ground state of the system is approximately @xmath22 , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : polaritonic_insulator_d0 ] demonstrates that , in the atom - cavity basis , this state has equal probabilities for atomic and photonic excitations .",

    "however , the nature of the individual cavity eigenstates is also altered by the change in the detuning , as seen in the inset of fig .  [",

    "we have @xmath45 and the ground state becomes @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "this is a delocalized photon state , i.e. a photonic superfluid .",
    "a state of this form is obtained by applying two iterations of the delocalized creation operator @xmath47 to the vacuum state  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : atomic_insulator ] .",
    "again , though , the nature of the atom - cavity states changes with the detuning . in the limit of large negative detuning , @xmath49 ( see the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : atomic_insulator ] ) .",
    "thus the ground state changes from a polaritonic insulator state at @xmath40 to an atomic insulator state at @xmath50 .",
    "the explanation for this is quite simple . from the definition of the detuning , @xmath19",
    ", it is evident that when the detuning is negative the energy of the atoms is smaller than that of the photons .",
    "therefore , the state of minimum energy is that in which only the atoms are excited .",

    "in the analysis so far we have identified atomic and polaritonic insulator regions as well as a photonic superfluid state .",
    "a natural question , then , is whether there exists a region in which the superfluid state exhibits polaritonic characteristics . in order to answer this question",
    ", we must first define a measure that quantifies the degree to which a state is polaritonic in nature .    within an isolated cavity ,",

    "the variances in the numbers of atomic and photonic excitations depend on the detuning , reaching a maximum at @xmath38 when the atomic and photonic degrees of freedom are maximally entangled and dropping off to zero in the large detuning limits where the states become either atomic or photonic in nature",
    ".    in the single - cavity case , the atomic excitation number variance and the photon number variance behave similarly .",
    "however , in the coupled - cavity system , the photon number variance is nonzero in the photonic superfluid state as well as in polaritonlike states . for this reason the photon number variance is not particularly helpful for our purposes and we shall not consider it here . the atomic excitation number variance , on the other hand , is zero in both the atomic insulator state and the photonic superfluid state , and thus provides a useful measure of the polaritonic nature of the state of the system .    a plot of the atomic excitation number variance @xmath52 , where @xmath53 , is shown in fig .",

    "as discussed earlier , the negative detuning provides an energy gap between the ground state and first excited state .",
