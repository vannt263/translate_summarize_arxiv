    "dwarf galaxies are fundamental laboratories to investigate the influence of the environment on star formation and on chemical evolution in stellar systems that are several order of magnitudes smaller than giant galaxies .",
    "empirical evidence indicates that in the local group together with the dwarf ellipticals ( de , m32-like ) and the dwarf spirals ( ds , m33-like ) we are facing three different dwarf morphological types .",
    "the dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) show either single ( cetus , @xcite ; tucana , @xcite ) or multiple star formation events ( carina , @xcite ) , are spheroidal in morphology and devoid of neutral hydrogen @xcite .",
    "the dwarf irregulars ( dis ) host a mix of old and young stellar populations , but they have recently experienced an intense sf episode @xcite , moreover , they have irregular morphology and host a significant fraction of neutral hydrogen .",
    "the transition dwarfs have properties between the dsphs and the dis .",
    "the observational scenario concerning the dwarfs in the lg was recently enriched by the discovery of ultra - faint dsphs in the sdss @xcite , but their properties still need to be investigated in detail .",
    "although the morphological classification appears robust , we still lack firm quantitative constraints concerning the evolution / transition between different dwarf morphological types .",
    "@xcite found a well defined dichotomy between ellipticals ( es ) and spheroidals ( sphs , @xcite ) .",
    "early type galaxies are distributed along a sequence moving from cd to des , while spheroidals are distributed along a sequence that overlaps with spirals and dwarf irregulars ( see fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "this empirical dichotomy seems to suggest that e and sph galaxies are stellar systems that underwent different formation and evolution processes",
    ". in particular , the sphs might be either spirals or irregulars that lost their gas or transformed it into stars . however , there is no general consensus concerning the e  sph dichotomy , since the correlation between the shape of the brightness profile and the galaxy luminosity is continuous when moving from es to sphs @xcite .",
    "theoretical and empirical uncertainties affect our understanding of several empirical correlations .",
    "more than twenty years ago it was suggested by @xcite that the luminosity of dwarfs is correlated with their mean metallicity .",
    "however , it is not clear whether this correlation is linear over the entire metallicity range or shows a plateau in the metal - poor regime @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was suggested by @xcite that des / dsphs in the lg , at fixed total visual luminosity , show larger mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratios ( see their fig .  1 ) .",
    "the same systems are , at fixed total stellar mass , more metal - rich than dis ( see their fig .  10 and @xcite ) .    precise and homogeneous photometric and spectroscopic data are required to address the above open issues concerning the formation and evolution of these systems .",
    "the advent of multi - object spectrographs at the 8 - 10 m class telescopes provided the unique opportunity to collect sizable samples of low- , medium- and high - resolution spectra covering the entire body of nearby dwarf galaxies . by using hundreds of radial velocity ( rv ) measurements",
    "it has been suggested by @xcite that sextans dsph host kinematic substructures , in particular , they found that the rv dispersion of the stellar population located across the center of this system is close to zero and increases outside the core .",
    "a different kinematic status has also been suggested by @xcite for the two distinct stellar populations in the sculptor dsph .",
    "moreover , evidence of a fall - off in the velocity dispersion at large galactic distances was suggested in sextans , draco and ursa minor @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite , using large and homogeneous samples of rv measurements based on high - resolution spectra collected with mike multi fiber spectrograph ( mmfs ) at magellan ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter w07 ) , found that the rv profile in several dsphs ( carina , draco , leoi , leoii , ursa minor ) are flat at large projected radii ( r@xmath111 kpc ) , while fornax , sculptor and sextans show a gentle decline .",
    "the observational scenario is far from being settled , and indeed , @xcite and @xcite using the same rv measurements provided by @xcite , but a different algorithm to reject tidally stripped stars , found a significant decline in the rv dispersion profile of carina , fornax , leoi , sculptor and sextans .",
    "furthermore , it was also suggested that kinematic status of carina @xcite and bootes @xcite might be disturbed by the milky way . in this context",
    ", carina plays a key role because it is relatively close ( @xmath12=20.10 mag ) , shows at least two well separated sf episodes ( t=1 - 6 and 12 gyr ) and it is metal - poor ( @xmath3[fe / h]@xmath131.7 dex ) .    our group is involved in a long - term project on the evolutionary properties , variable stars , kinematic and abundances of stellar populations in the carina dsph .",
    "this is the fourth paper of a series and it is focused on the radial velocity distribution of candidate carina stars .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we discuss in detail the different spectroscopic data sets we collected for this experiment , together with the approach we adopted to reduce the data .",
    "section 3 deals with radial velocity measurements and with the observational strategy we adopted to validate radial velocities based on low- , medium- and high resolution spectra . in section 4 we lay out the selection criteria adopted to identify candidate carina stars and their radial velocity distribution . in section 5",
    ", we investigate the velocity distribution , the velocity dispersion and the kurtosis of candidate carina stars as a function of the projected radial distance . in this section",
    ", we also address the similarity between spectroscopic and photometric radial distributions .",
    "finally , in section 6 we summarize the results of this investigation and briefly outline possible future extensions of this photometric and spectroscopic experiment .",
    "to collect low - resolution spectra of old ( horizontal branch [ hb ] , @xmath720.75 mag ) , intermediate ( red clump [ rc ] , @xmath720.5 mag ) and young ( blue plume [ bp ] , @xmath722 mag ) stellar tracers ( see fig .",
    "1 ) we observed five fields with fors2 at vlt @xcite in service mode .",
    "the program was almost completed by one of us ( m.n . ) during a visitor mode observations in december 2004 .",
    "a significant fraction of fors2 spectra were collected using the 1400v grism , which covers h@xmath14 ( @xmath15=4861.34  ) and mgi triplet ( mgit=5167.32 , 5172.68 , 5183.62  ] ) lines , with a nominal resolution of 2100 ( @xmath16=5200  ) .",
    "the slits used were 06 length , and typically 10  long , with a wavelength coverage @xmath245605860  .",
    "the exposure times range from 22 minutes ( _ short _ ) to more than one hour ( _ long _ ) .    during the december 2004 run",
    ", the 1028z grism was also used with a wavelength coverage @xmath277309480  .",
    "its nominal resolution is 2560 ( @xmath16=8600  ) and covers the near - infrared ( nir ) calcium triplet ( cat= 8498.02 , 8542.09 , 8662.14  ] ) . using the 1400v grism we secured in 19.12 hrs of exposure time 743 individual spectra of 356 stars with dimm seeing ranging from 035  to 127 , while using the 1028z grism we secured in 1 hr of exposure time 113 spectra of 73 stars with seeing 038059 .",
    "most of the stars with 1028z spectra also have 1400v spectra .",
    "we ended up with a total sample of 359 stars either with single or multiple fors2 spectra .",
    "in particular , the lr data set collected with the grism 1400v includes 356 stars and among them eleven have a single spectrum , while the others a number of spectra ranging from two to twelve . the lr data set collected with the grism 1028z includes 73 stars and among them 39 have single spectra , while the others a number of spectra ranging from two to three . in total the lr data set includes 359 stars of which eleven have a single spectrum and the others a number of spectra ranging from two to 14 .",
    "table  1 gives the log of the observations of the spectra collected with fors2 . from left to right are listed the date , the pointing , the coordinates , the grism , the exposure time and the seeing .",
    "these data were complemented by archival medium and high - resolution spectra of red giant ( rg ) and rc stars collected with giraffe @xcite at vlt and covering the entire body of the galaxy ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the giraffe spectra @xcite were collected using the grating lr8 with a nominal resolution of 6,500 centered on the nir cat .",
    "this data set ( hereinafter gmr03 ) includes 10,394 individual fiber spectra of 1,070 stars and were secured with a total exposure time of 95.4 hrs with seeing condition of 0422 .",
    "note that this data set was also adopted by @xcite in their analysis of carina radial velocity distribution .",
    "we also use the high - resolution spectra collected with the gratings : hr10 ( r=19,800 , 5339@xmath1@xmath15@xmath15619  ) , hr13 ( r=22,500 , 6120@xmath1@xmath15@xmath16405  ) and hr14a ( r=17,740 , 6308@xmath1@xmath15@xmath16701  ) .",
    "this data set ( hereinafter ghr ) includes 2,002 individual spectra of 98 stars , secured with a total exposure time of 24 hrs and seeing 057320 .",
    "the above data were complemented by a new set of giraffe spectra collected with lr8 and including 8,092 individual spectra of 959 stars .",
    "this data set ( hereinafter gmr08 ) was secured with 48.4 hrs of exposure time and seeing of 054194 .",
    "we ended up with a total sample of 1,931 stars either with single or multiple giraffe spectra .",
    "the gmr ( @xmath3gmr03@xmath17gmr08@xmath4 , weighted mean ) data set includes 1,887 stars and only one star has a single spectrum , while the others have multiple spectra ranging from two to 35 .",
    "the hr data set includes 98 stars and all of them have multiple spectra ranging from seven to nine .",
    "moreover , the ghr and the gmr03 spectra have 38 objects in common , while 125 objects are in common between ghr plus gmr03 and gmr08 spectra .",
    "the lr resolution data set has 145 objects in common with the giraffe ( ghr plus gmr ) data set .",

    "the numbers in parenthesis give the number of stars for which we estimated the radial velocity and the total number of stars for which we collected at least one spectrum .",
    "data plotted in the bottom panels of fig .  1",
    "show several interesting features : _",
    "i ) _ _ stellar tracers _ ",
    "the fors2 spectra cover old , intermediate and young stellar tracers ( @xmath122 , 359 rvs ) . _",
    "ii ) _ _ statistics _  although the exposure time of the giraffe spectra is a factor of 4 - 8 longer than the fors2 spectra , their limiting magnitude is @xmath120.6 ( fibers vs slits ) .",
    "this means that this data set does not cover young ( bp ) and truly old ( hb ) tracers .",
    "the rgs are , indeed , a mix of old and intermediate  age stellar tracers . however , the sample of rv measurements based on giraffe spectra ( 1,985 vs 359 ) is more than a factor of five larger than fors2 ( fov @xmath725 vs @xmath75 arcmin squared ) . _",
    "iii ) _ _ multiplicity _  a significant fraction of our targets have multiple spectra .",
    "this means that we can provide robust estimates of intrinsic errors . _",
    "iv ) _  _ a significant overlap of low , medium and high - resolution spectra _  we can constrain the occurrence of possible systematic errors in rv measurements using spectra collected with different instruments and different gratings / grisms .",
    "we reduced our fors2 data using standard iraf tasks , using day time associated bias frames , flat field and calibration lamps .",
    "the wavelength calibration was carried out using the task identify , daytime lamp frames and a set of 8 - 12 calibration lines .",
    "we typically end up with an accuracy better than @xmath20.020.04  , @xmath02.5 .",
    "however , we found systematic shifts up to 1 pixel , corresponding to @xmath230  in radial velocity , for the two adopted grisms . to overcome the problem",
    ", we adopted the approach suggested by @xcite .",
    "a model of the sky for each slit was created and subtracted from the reduced 2d spectrum .",
    "this model was also used to estimate and correct the systematic shifts from the daytime wavelength calibration lamps , using night sky lines , mainly oi 5577.34   for the 1400v grism and a set of isolated skylines for the 1028z grism .",
    "yet another potential source of systematics in rv estimates was the centroiding ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thanks to the special care in the mask design , based on previous fors2 preimaging of selected carina fields , and to the very precise tracking of vlt , this effect was limited at the level of 5 - 10 . to estimate the shift between the centroid of the star and the slit we adopted the slit image which is acquired just before the spectrum . for each target",
    "the centroid of the slit is evaluated by collapsing the slit along its width and neglecting the pixels belonging to the star .",
    "the collapsed slit is then subtracted away from the pixels belonging to the star , whose centroid is then estimated with the task center in iraf .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we also acquired slit images , for a couple of masks , soon after we collected the spectra .",
    "these slit images were adopted to confirm that our estimates of the centroids were minimally affected by tracking problems .",
    "the details of the pre - reduction and reduction of fors2 spectra will be discussed in a forthcoming paper ( nonino et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "the giraffe raw data were retrieved from the eso archive .",
    "these data were reduced using iraf . after the standard bias and flat correction",
    ", the spectra were extracted using the traces from flats .",
    "wavelength calibration is based on daily calibration lamps : the formal solution rms was @xmath30.02  , corresponding to a systematic @xmath31  in rv .",
    "after the fiber - spectra assignment , performed using the table associated with the raw data , all the spectra were visually inspected in order to remove bad spectra .",
    "a master sky for each exposure was created from sky fibers , after the spectra had been cross - correlated to remove shifts and scaled using the intensity of selected night sky lines in the wavelength range 82508750  , to better match the region with stellar absorption lines .",
    "subsequently the master skies were cross correlated with the targets spectra , scaled in intensity and subtracted .",
    "the cross correlation among the stacked skies showed that the relative accuracy in wavelength calibration could give systematics of the order of 500 m s@xmath18 in rv .",
    "we finally coadded all the individual spectra of the same target using the task scombine , after correcting for the barycentric motion .",
    "the giraffe spectra taken with the high resolution grisms were reduced following a similar approach .",
    "to measure the rv of gmr and ghr spectra we fit individual spectral lines in the coadded spectra .",
    "the rv of the lr spectra was measured on individual spectra and the final rv was estimated as a weighted mean among the multiple spectra , when available , of the same object .",
    "all spectra were normalized to the continuum and the fit to single or multiple lines performed using either a gaussian or a moffat function .",
    "the interactive code developed to perform the rv measurements will be described in a forthcoming paper ( fabrizio et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "we selected by visual inspection several spectral lines for each data set , namely h@xmath14 and mgi triplet for fors2/1400v spectra ( see the spectra plotted in the panels d ) of fig .",
    "2 ) , the cat for fors2/1028z and gmr spectra ( see the spectra plotted in the panels c ) and b ) of fig .  2 ) and several strong fei lines for ghr spectra ( see the spectra plotted in the panels a ) of fig .  2 ) .",
    "the quoted lines were typically fit with a moffat function with @xmath19=2 , to properly account for the contribution of the wings in the line fit .",
    "this preliminary estimate of the rv was validated by eye inspection and when judged satisfactory it was adopted to perform an automatic estimate of the rv using a large set of iron and heavy element lines .",
    "we adopted the line list for iron , @xmath20- and heavy - elements recently provided by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "the lines were selected according to the wavelength range and the spectral resolution of the different instruments and grisms .",
    "we ended up with a sub - sample of 3070 lines for lr ( grisms : 1028z , 1400v ) spectra , with @xmath235 lines for gmr spectra and with @xmath290 lines for the ghr spectra .",
    "for each spectrum we estimate the rvs as a weighted mean of the lines with the highest s / n ratio .",
    "this on average means 1 - 2 dozens of lines for lr and gmr spectra and approximately 40 lines for the ghr spectra .",
    "the error in the rv based on individual lines was assumed equal to the sigma of the fitting function = c@xmath21/@xmath15 ] .",
    "the rv of the entire spectrum was estimated as a weighted mean over the different fitted lines .",
    "the error in the radial velocity of coadded spectra ( gmr , ghr ) is the error of the weighted mean .",
    "the rv of the lr spectra was estimated following the same approach for stars with a single spectrum and as a weighted mean among the different mean measurements for the stars with multiple spectra .",
    "data plotted in fig .",
    "3 show that the intrinsic error of the rv measurements based on ghr spectra is on average ( biweight mean ) @xmath31  ( panels a , b , c ) and becomes of the order of 5  for gmr03 spectra ( panel d ) .",
    "note that the intrinsic error of gmr08 spectra is larger and @xmath76 .",
    "the difference is mainly due to the s / n ratio , since the latter sample is on average 0.5 mag fainter and its total exposure time is almost a factor of two shorter .",
    "the intrinsic error of the rvs based on lr spectra is slightly larger and ranges from @xmath711  ( grism 1028z , panel f ) to @xmath710  ( grism 1400v , panel g ) .",
    "the difference between the fors2 data sets is expected .",
    "the first two lines of the cat , at the typical rv of carina stars , are contaminated by atmospheric oh emission lines .",
    "therefore , the rv measurements based either on low - resolution spectra or on medium - resolution , low s / n ratio spectra might be affected by slightly larger uncertainties in case the sky lines are not precisely subtracted .",
    "the reader , interested in a more detailed discussion , is referred to @xcite and to @xcite .",
    "moreover , the 1028z spectra have a number of repeats that are approximately a factor of two smaller than the number of repeats of the 1400v spectra ( see  2 ) .",
    "the fraction of objects for which we measured the rv is quite high , and indeed the fraction ranges from @xmath798% for ghr and gmr03 spectra , to @xmath290% for lr ( 1400v ) spectra and to more than @xmath280% for gmr08 and lr ( 1028z ) spectra . typically the stars with no rv measurements have either low s / n or noisy spectra ( see  2 ) or missing identification in the photometric catalog .",
    "eventually , the rv was measured in 2,165 out of the 2,323 giraffe spectra ( @xmath793% ) and in 381 out of the 429 ( @xmath789% ) fors2 spectra ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . in total",
    "the rv was measured in 1,812 stars using giraffe spectra and in 324 stars using fors2 spectra ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the final catalog includes rv measurements for 1,979 stars . to validate the approach adopted to measure the rvs",
    ", we decided to use real spectra .",
    "this approach has several indisputable advantages when compared with artificially generated spectra , since the different spectroscopic data sets we are dealing with partially overlap .",
    "we can constrain the precision of rvs based on hr spectra , since for each object we have three spectra with similar spectral resolutions and covering three different wavelength regions ( hr10 , hr13 , hr14a , see  2 ) .",
    "the panels a ) and b ) of fig .  4 show the internal comparison of our rv measurements as a function of the -magnitude .",
    "the difference and the rv dispersion of the entire sample and of the candidate carina stars ( red dots , 180@xmath8rv@xmath8260 , see  4 ) are minimal .",
    "we can also constrain the precision of the gmr03 spectra , since this subsample has more than three dozens of stars in common with the ghr spectra .",
    "the panel c ) shows the difference between the rvs based on the @xmath3ghr@xmath4 and those based on the gmr03 spectra ( weighted mean ) .",
    "the mean ( biweight ) of the difference is 0.1  for the candidate carina stars ( 26 ) and smaller than 1  for the entire sample ( 35 ) .",
    "the gmr03 rvs were corrected for the difference .",
    "the panel d ) shows the difference between the rvs based on @xmath3ghr@xmath4 plus gmr03 ( weighted mean ) spectra and rvs based on gmr08 spectra .",
    "we have more than 120 stars in common and all of them are candidate carina stars . the difference is smaller than 3  and the @xmath6@xmath28 . the difference with the rvs based on gmr03 spectra is mainly due to the fact that the gmr08 spectra have a lower s / n ratio and are on average fainter .",

    "the difference with the mateo sample is quite small both in the mean ( biweight ) and in the velocity dispersion .",
    "the difference with the majewski sample is larger ( @xmath12=3.6 , @xmath6=9.4 ) , and it is caused by the lower s / n ratio of the spectra they adopted to estimate the rvs .",
    "the panel b ) shows the comparison between our rvs and rvs based either on high - resolution spectra collected with mike at magellan ( crosses ) or on medium - resolution spectra collected with giraffe at vlt ( filled circles ) provided by @xcite .",
    "the mike spectra were collected in slit mode with a resolution of @xmath719,000 ( red arm ) and the rv measurements are based on the nir calcium triplet .",
    "the giraffe spectra adopted by @xcite are the same gmr03 spectra we also included in this investigation .",
    "the difference with rvs based on mike spectra is minimal ( @xmath31 ) , but the sample of stars in common is limited ( 14 ) .",
    "the difference with the rvs based on giraffe spectra is larger @xmath73  if we account for the entire sample of stars in common ( 850/889 stars , @xmath6=5.7 ) and for candidate carina stars ( 353/373 stars , @xmath6=6.7 ) .",
    "the reasons for this difference are not clear , apart from the fact that we adopted a different approach to prereduce the spectra and to measure the rvs .",
    "the panel c ) shows the comparison with the rvs provided by w07 .",
    "the rv measurements provided by w07 are based on high - resolution ( 20,00025,000 ) spectra collected with mmfs at magellan . these spectra sample the region across the magnesium triplet ( 51405180 ) .",
    "we have more than 550 candidate carina stars in common and the data plotted in this panel show that the two samples of rv measurements agree , within the errors quite well .",
    "the difference is 2  ( biweight ) and the rv dispersion is smaller than 10 .",
    "the same outcome applies to the rvs based on fors2 spectra ( see panel d ) .",
    "we have more than 80 candidate carina stars in common and the difference is @xmath21 , while the dispersion @xmath6@xmath711 .",

    "for the objects with rvs based on both giraffe and fors2 spectra we performed a weighted mean , using as weights the inverse square of the radial velocities standard errors of the gmr , ghr and lr spectra . as a final test , we compared our entire rv data set with the rvs provided by w07 .",
    "data plotted in panel e ) further support the agreement between the two different sets of rv measurements , and indeed the difference ranges from less than 1  for the entire sample ( 785 objects in common ) to 2  for candidate carina stars ( 574 ) , while the dispersion is @xmath79 .",
    "the estimates of the mean difference are based , once again , on the biweight and the number of neglected objects is smaller than 9% .",
    "the precision of both internal and external validations , and in particular the good agreement with the rvs provided by w07 , support the approach we adopted to measure the rvs .",
    "the referee asked us to comment the impact of binaries stars on the current rv measurements .",
    "the occurrence of binary stars among rg stars in dsph galaxies is a highly debated topic and their impact on the rv dispersion ranges from a sizable @xcite to a small error @xcite when compared with the statistical error .",
    "however , in a recent investigation @xcite found , by using a detailed statistical approach , that dsph galaxies with rv dispersions ranging from 4 to 10 can be inflated by no more than 20% due to the orbital motion of binary stars .",
    "it is worth noting that the current lr spectra cover a time interval of three years ( 2004 - 2007 ) and the number of repeats ranges from two to 14 ( only eleven stars with a single spectrum ) .",
    "the gmr spectra cover a time interval of five years ( 2003 - 2008 ) and the number of repeats ranges from two to 35 ( only 1 star with a single spectrum ) .",
    "the ghr spectra were collected in 2005 and the number of repeats ranges from seven to nine .",
    "the three different data sets have 145 objects in common .",
    "this means that a significant fraction of stars in our sample have spectra collected on a time interval of several years .",
    "therefore , the current rv measurements are less prone to significant changes caused by binary stars . moreover ,",
    "the conclusions of the current investigation are minimally affected by a possible uncertainty of the order of 20% in the rv dispersion .",
    "the top panel of fig .  7 shows the rv distribution of the entire ( giraffe+fors2 ) data set .",
    "the well defined primary peak located at rv@xmath7220  includes candidate carina stars .",
    "the current radial velocity distribution is soundly supported by the radial velocity distribution recently provided by w07 , but based on a smaller number of stars ( see the middle panel of fig .  7 ) .",
    "this evidence and the minimal difference in the rv of the stars in common allowed us to merge the two rv catalogs .",
    "for the objects in common weighted mean rvs were computed using as weights the inverse square standard errors in the individual rv measurements .",
    "we ended up with a sample of 2,629 stars ( see the bottom panel of fig .",

    "this sample of carina rvs is @xmath275% larger than any previous rv sample . to overcome subtle uncertainties in the estimate of the rv due to the possible presence of outliers in the final data set , we estimated the biweight mean of this sample and we found 220.9@xmath50.1",

    "the referee has expressed concerns about the possible dependence of the carina rv distribution on the different samples of rv measurements . to constrain this effect",
    "we estimated the rv distribution of carina stars using stars brighter than = 20.25 mag ( 651 ) .",

    "in order to constrain whether the occurrence of asymmetries in the radial velocity distribution is caused by the presence of substructures in carina , we investigated the change in the rv distribution as a function of the projected radial distance ( @xmath24 ) . to avoid spurious fluctuations in the mean rv",

    "the @xmath24 of each subsample was estimated as the mean over the individual distances of the same 200 stars .",
    "we estimated the same quantities by moving of one object in the ranked list until we accounted for the most distant 200 stars in our sample located inside the tidal radius ( @xmath25@xmath728.8@xmath53.6 , @xcite ) .",
    "the error on the mean rv for individual bins is smaller than one tenth of . in order to provide robust constraints on the possible uncertainties introduced by the number of stars per bin and by the number of stepping stars we performed a series of montecarlo simulations .",

    "this evidence is robust , since the mean ( biweight , black line ) and the median ( blue line ) attain very similar values and intrinsic errors . to further constrain the change of the kinematic status across the body of the galaxy we also estimated the radial velocity dispersion ( @xmath28 , solid line middle panel of fig .",

    "we also found that the dispersion is larger in the innermost regions , decreases in coincidence of the minimum in the mean rv and after a mild increase attains an almost constant value in the outermost galaxy regions .",

    "10 shows a mirror trend compared with the projected radial velocity dispersion and with the mean rv .",
    "this evidence is suggesting that in the carina regions where the mean rv is smaller , the dispersion is also smaller and the radial velocity distribution more centrally peaked .",
    "the opposite trend characterizes the regions in which the mean rv is larger .",

    "the difference is equal to @xmath72.1  ( 4@xmath6 level ) and increases by almost a factor of two ( @xmath74.5 , 9@xmath6 level ) if we take into account the absolute maximum ( @xmath7223.3@xmath50.4 , @xmath7320 pc from the center ) and the absolute minimum ( @xmath7218.8@xmath50.4 , @xmath7 - 280 pc from the center ) of the mean rv .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the increase in the mean velocity both in the external regions and outside the galactic center appears to be in the same direction of the carina proper motion ( large blue arrow in panel d ) of fig .  12 , @xcite ) .",

    "it is noteworthy , that the quoted findings are minimally affected by the fors2 , giraffe and w07 data sets adopted to estimate the rvs of candidate carina stars .    to explain the occurrence of a kinematically cold population close to the center of sextans , @xcite suggested , using also photometric radial distributions , that it could be the aftermath of a merging with a globular cluster . to further constrain the nature of the above kinematic peculiarities we investigated the carina radial distributions , using the same approach adopted by @xcite and the recent photometric catalog by @xcite .",
    "the isocontour levels ( panel b ) and the marginal ( panel a ) along the right ascension axis plotted in fig .  13 show that the radial distribution is flat - topped across the carina center .",

    "the bulk of the spectra were collected using the 1400v grism covering the @xmath30 and the mgi triplet . for a fraction ( 20% ) of these targets we also collected spectra using the 1028z grism centered on the nir cat .",

    "the above kinematic selection was firmly supported by the position of the candidate carina stars along the expected evolutionary sequences ( rg , agb , rc , hb , blue plume ) of the cmd . the narrow distribution in color of the candidate carina rg stars confirms the recent findings by @xcite , based on photometric selection criteria , that the spread in metallicity of carina stars is smaller than suggested by spectroscopic measurements @xcite .",

    "a more detailed investigation of the rv across the body of the galaxy indicates that the mean rv changes from @xmath7220  at a distance of 7  ( @xmath7200 pc ) from the center to @xmath7223  at 13  ( 6@xmath6 level ) and attains an almost constant value of @xmath7221222  at larger distances ( 35@xmath6 level ) .",

    "<S> we present new and accurate radial velocity ( rv ) measurements of luminous stars of all ages ( old horizontal branch , intermediate  age red clump , and young blue plume , as well as red giants of a range of ages ; 20.6@xmath0@xmath022 ) in the carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy , based on low - resolution spectra collected with the fors2 multi - object slit spectrograph at the vlt . </S>",
    "<S> this data set was complemented by rv measurements based on medium and high - resolution archive spectra of brighter ( @xmath120.6 ) carina targets collected with the giraffe multi - object fiber spectrograph at the vlt . </S>",
    "<S> the combined sample includes more than 21,340 individual spectra of @xmath22,000 stars covering the entire body of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the mean ( @xmath3rv@xmath4=220.4@xmath50.1 ) and the dispersion ( @xmath6=11.7@xmath50.1 ) of the rv distribution of candidate carina stars ( @xmath71,210 objects , 180@xmath8@xmath9@xmath8260 , 4@xmath6 ) agree quite well with similar measurements available in the literature . to further improve the statistics </S>",
    "<S> , the accurate rv measurements recently provided by @xcite were also added to the current data set . </S>",
    "<S> we ended up with a sample of @xmath71,370 rv measurements of candidate carina stars that is @xmath275% larger than any previous carina rv sample . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the hypothesis that the carina rv distribution is gaussian can be discarded at 99% confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> the mean rv across the body of the galaxy varies from @xmath7220  at a distance of 7  ( @xmath7200 pc ) from the center to @xmath7223  at 13 ( @xmath7400 pc , 6@xmath6 level ) and flattens out to a constant value of @xmath7221  at larger distances ( 600 pc , 4@xmath6 level ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover and even more importantly , we found that in the carina regions where the mean rv is smaller the dispersion is also smaller , and the rv distribution is more centrally peaked ( i.e. the kurtosis attains larger values ) . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in mean rv is more than 4  ( 9@xmath6 level ) , when moving from e to w , and more than 3  ( @xmath77@xmath6 level ) , when moving from n to s. the rv gradient appears to be in the direction of the carina proper motion . </S>",
    "<S> however , this parameter is affected by large uncertainties to reach a firm conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> there is evidence of a secondary maximum in rv across the carina center ( @xmath10@xmath8200 pc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of a secondary feature across the carina center is also supported by the flat - topped radial distribution based on the photometric catalog . </S>",
    "<S> these findings are reminiscent of a substructure with transition properties , already detected in dwarf ellipticals , and call for confirmation by independent investigations . </S>"
