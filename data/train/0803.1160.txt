    "the first physics run of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is scheduled for 2008 . investigating jet , weak boson and top quark production are the prime goals of the 2008 run .",
    "top pair production at the lhc , with a cross section which is about two orders of magnitude larger than at the fermilab tevatron , will make it possible to precisely determine the top quark properties  @xcite .",
    "it also offers an excellent opportunity to search for new physics in the early operational phase of the lhc .",
    "once the lhc reaches design luminosity , @xmath0 production will provide access to new phenomena in the multi - tev region .",
    "many extensions of the standard model ( sm ) predict particles which decay into @xmath0 pairs , and thus show up as resonances in the @xmath0 invariant mass , @xmath9 , distribution .",
    "the masses of these particles are typically in the tev range .",
    "for example , topcolor  @xcite and little higgs  @xcite models predict weakly coupled new vector bosons , models with extra dimensions  @xcite can have kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations of the graviton  @xcite the weak  @xcite and the strong gauge bosons  @xcite which couple to top quarks , while massive axial vector bosons appear in torsion gravity models  @xcite .",
    "resonances in the @xmath10 channel also occur in technicolor  @xcite , chiral color  @xcite and models with a strong @xmath11 gauge symmetry  @xcite . in some models",
    "@xcite , the couplings of the new particles to light quarks and gluons is suppressed , and the @xmath0 final state becomes their main discovery channel . for a model independent approach to search for new physics in @xmath0 production ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "top quarks decay either hadronically , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , or semileptonically , @xmath14 ( @xmath2 ; decays with @xmath15 leptons in the final state are ignored here ) .",
    "pair production of top quarks thus results in so - called `` di - lepton+jets '' events , @xmath16 , `` lepton+jets '' events , @xmath1 , or the `` all - hadronic '' , @xmath17  quarks , final state .",
    "although the di - lepton+jets channel has the smallest background , it suffers from a small branching ratio ( about 4.7% ) .",
    "furthermore , the two neutrinos in the final state make it impossible to reconstruct the @xmath0 invariant mass or the transverse momentum ( @xmath18 ) of the individual top quark .",
    "the all - hadronic final state has the largest branching ratio ( @xmath19 ) but also suffers from a very large background .",
    "the lepton+jets channel , finally , has a substantial branching fraction ( about 30% ) , while the background is moderate .",
    "since the @xmath0 invariant mass can be reconstructed , albeit with a two - fold ambiguity , it is the premier search channel for new physics in @xmath0 production . to identify @xmath0 lepton+jets events ,",
    "the lhc experiments require an isolated charged lepton , missing transverse momentum , and at least four isolated hadronic jets . for events with more than four jets ,",
    "the four leading ( highest transverse momentum ) jets are selected . of these four jets two have to be tagged as a @xmath3-quarks  @xcite .",
    "searching for @xmath0 resonances with masses in the tev region is challenging for several reasons . for top quark transverse momenta larger than a few hundred gev and @xmath0 invariant masses above 1  tev , the top quark decay products are highly boosted and thus almost collinear .",
    "this frequently results in non - isolated leptons and/or merged or overlapping jets for lepton+jets and all - hadronic @xmath0 events , _ ie . _",
    "the number of jets may be smaller than the number of final state quarks .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath3-tagging efficiency in the tev region may be significantly smaller than at low energies  @xcite .",
    "extending the selection criteria to include topologies with fewer jets and events with only one tagged @xmath3-quark is an obvious strategy for improving the selection efficiency for very energetic top quarks . on the other hand",
    ", this may significantly increase the background . in ref .",
    "@xcite we presented a detailed analysis of the @xmath0 lepton+jets finals states with 2 , 3 , or 4  jets and one or two tagged @xmath3-quarks .",
    "we showed that the @xmath20  jets and @xmath21  jets final states with one or two @xmath3-tags significantly improve the chances for discovering new heavy particles in the @xmath0 channel at the lhc , although the background from @xmath6  jets and single top production will be non - negligible in the tev region , even after imposing suitable cuts .    in this paper",
    "we derive semi - realistic discovery limits for @xmath0 resonances in the lepton+jets final states using the results of ref .",
    "we consider kaluza - klein excitations of the gluon in representative bulk randall - sundrum ( rs ) models , in particular those described in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "taking into account the finite resolution of the lhc detectors , the energy loss due to @xmath3-quark decays , the expected reduced @xmath3-tagging efficiency at large @xmath0 invariant masses , and the background originating from @xmath22  jets , @xmath5  jets , @xmath6  jets , and single top + jets production , we derive @xmath7 discovery limits and contrast them with those found for kk gravitons in bulk rs models  @xcite and the @xmath8 boson of the littlest higgs model  @xcite .",

    "however , much of that funnel lies in the region where possible unitarity violations cast doubt on the reliability of our results .",
    "the peculiar shape of the contour limits in the @xmath46 model with @xmath51 can be easily understood by recalling that the coupling of the kk gluon to right - handed top quarks almost vanishes in this model ( see table  [ tab : one ] ) . in the limit where @xmath53 and @xmath35 does not change appreciably when @xmath31 and @xmath54 are varied ,",

    "although we have not studied the correlations for cases where one of the couplings dominates the kk gluon width , we expect that strong correlations may also occur there .",
    "while it will only be possible to obtain a limited amount of information on the couplings of kk gluons at the lhc with 300  fb@xmath52 or less of data when correlations are included , it will be possible to measure them with a precision of @xmath71 at the slhc .",
    "many new physics models predict the existence of new particles decaying into a @xmath0 pair with masses in the tev region .",
    "they lead to a peak in the @xmath0 invariant mass distribution and a jacobian peak in the @xmath72 differential cross section . in this paper",
    "we specifically studied the production of kk gluons in bulk rs models in the @xmath0 channel at the lhc .",
    "since the couplings of kk gluons to light quarks is suppressed in many bulk rs models , the @xmath0 final state becomes their main discovery channel .",
    "the lepton+jets final state offers a good opportunity to search for such particles .",
    "the search for resonances in the @xmath0 channel with masses in the tev region requires the reconstruction of very energetic top quarks which faces two major difficulties .",
    "firstly , very energetic top quarks are strongly boosted , and their decay products are highly collimated .",
    "this leads to overlapping and merging jets from hadronically decaying top quarks .",
    "secondly , the tagging efficiency for @xmath3-quarks in @xmath0 events with very energetic top quarks may be up to a factor  3 smaller , and the misidentification probability of light quark or gluon jets may be up to a factor of  3 higher , than at low energies .",
    "this reduces the number of @xmath0 events which can be identified , and increases the background .    as we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , these problems can be partially overcome by considering the @xmath73  jets final states with one or two tagged @xmath3-quarks and @xmath74 instead of the canonical @xmath75  jets final state with two @xmath3-tags , and by imposing suitable invariant mass and cluster transverse mass cuts . using the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculated @xmath7 discovery limits for kk gluons in nine different bulk rs models by combining information from the @xmath0 invariant mass , and the @xmath76 distribution .",
    "although information on the longitudinal degree of freedom is lost in the @xmath62 distribution , it has the advantage of a substantially smaller sm non-@xmath0 background .",
    "our calculation takes into account the typical momentum resolution of an lhc experiment , particle identification efficiencies , and the energy loss due to @xmath3-quark decay .",
    "assuming a @xmath3-tagging efficiency of @xmath77 and a light quark / gluon jet misidentification probability of @xmath78 , as suggested by preliminary atlas simulations  @xcite , we found that , in most models considered , kk gluons with a mass of up to @xmath79  tev ( @xmath80  tev ) can be discovered at the lhc with an integrated luminosity of 100  fb@xmath52 ( 300  fb@xmath52 ) .",
    "for comparison , electroweak precision measurements require kk gluons in bulk rs models to be heavier than @xmath81  tev  @xcite .",
    "the lhc should therefore be able to considerably constrain such models .    for comparison",
    ", we also listed the discovery limits for the @xmath8 boson in the littlest higgs model , and the kk graviton in bulk rs models in the @xmath0 channel .",
    "the discovery limits for the @xmath8 boson are about a factor  1.5 , and those for the kk graviton are more than a factor  2 , weaker than those for kk gluons . in both cases , other final states may offer a better chance to search for these particles : the @xmath8 boson can be discovered in drell - yan production with masses up to 5  tev , whereas a kk graviton in bulk rs models can be found in the @xmath82 final state with masses up to 3.5  tev .",
    "we also investigated , for the example of a kk gluon with mass @xmath61  tev , how well different bulk rs models can be distinguished through a measurement of the kk gluon resonance curve .",
    "we found that , for 100  fb@xmath52 , the @xmath25 models can only be distinguished at the @xmath83 level .",
    "however , the remaining models can be discriminated with a significance of @xmath84 .",
    "the @xmath25 models and non-@xmath25 models , finally , can be separated at the @xmath85 level , except for the basic rs and the @xmath86 model which will be very hard to discriminate from a measurement of the kk gluon resonance curve .",
    "the conclusion to draw from this investigation is that the breit - wigner resonance curve in the @xmath0 final state does have some analyzing power , and thus may be helpful in discriminating new physics models .",
    "finally , we studied how well the kk gluon couplings can be measured at the lhc and slhc . in the @xmath25 , @xmath87 models ,",
    "the coupling to the right - handed @xmath3-quark is an independent parameter .",
    "since @xmath3-quark fusion contributes only little to the kk gluon cross section , it will be impossible to determine the @xmath88 coupling from the shape of the kk gluon resonance curve in the @xmath0 final state .",
    "the remaining three couplings , @xmath31 , @xmath89 , and @xmath66 , however , can be constrained from an analysis of the @xmath9 and @xmath76 distributions .",
    "we presented one- and two - dimensional 68.3% cl limits for these couplings .",
    "in several models , one coupling completely dominates the kk gluon width .",
    "since interference effects vanish , and the dependence on the coupling which dominates the width approximately cancels , at the peak position of the breit - wigner resonance where most kk gluon events are concentrated , it will be difficult to precisely measure this coupling .",
    "we also found that correlations between couplings may strongly affect the sensitivity bounds which can be achieved . nevertheless , at the slhc",
    ", it should be possible to determine the couplings of a kk gluon resonance with a mass of up to 3  tev with a precision of @xmath71 in most models .",
    "our results are subject to a number of uncertainties and thus should be interpreted with care .",
    "foremost , since most background processes are not known at nlo , all our signal and background calculations have been carried out at lo , and thus are subject to substantial renormalization and factorization uncertainties .",
    "a perhaps even larger uncertainty originates from the @xmath3-tagging efficiency and the light quark and gluon jet misidentification probability at large @xmath0 invariant masses , which is only poorly known at present .",
    "pdf uncertainties , on the other hand , appear to be relatively small  @xcite .",
    "the numerical results presented here were obtained by combining information from the @xmath9 and the @xmath62 distributions .",
    "since we ignore correlated systematic uncertainties , our results are somewhat optimistic . on the other hand ,",
    "our background estimate has been deliberately conservative .",
    "furthermore , in future studies one may include additional distributions in the analysis such as the transverse momentum distribution of the charged lepton which is sensitive to the chirality of the coupling of the kk gluon to the top quark .",
    "this could potentially improve the accuracy on the kk gluon couplings which may be obtained at the lhc and slhc .",

    "<S> we derive semi - realistic @xmath7 discovery limits for nine different kk gluon scenarios , and compare them with those for kk gravitons , and a @xmath8 boson in the littlest higgs model . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze the capabilities of the lhc experiments to differentiate between individual kk gluon models and measure the couplings of kk gluons to quarks . </S>",
