    "the ( pseudo)scalar meson decay constants @xmath12 are of prime interests for understanding the realizations of chiral symmetry in qcd .",
    "in addition to the well - known values of @xmath13 mev and @xmath14 mev @xcite which control the light flavour chiral symmetries , it is also desirable to extract the ones of the heavy - light charm and bottom quark systems with high - accuracy .",
    "these decay constants are normalized through the matrix element : 0|j^p_|qq(x)|p= f_p m_p^2  , [ eq : fp ] where : j^p_|qq(x)(m_q+m_q)|q(i_5)q  , [ eq : current ] is the local heavy - light pseudoscalar current ; @xmath15and where @xmath12 is related to the leptonic width : ( p^+l^+_l)=g^2_f8|v_qq|^2f^2_pm_l^2m_p1-m_l^2m_p^2 ^ 2  , where @xmath16 is the lepton mass and @xmath17 the ckm mixing angle . besides some earlier attempts based on non - relativistic potential models to extract these quantities ( which are however not applicable for the heavy - light systems ) ,",
    "the first bounds on @xmath18 and @xmath19 from qcd spectral sum rules ( qssr ) @xcite were derived by nsv2z @xcite , which have been improved four years later in @xcite . since then , but long time before the lattice results , different qssr papers have been published in the literature for estimating @xmath20 .",
    "these results look , at first sight , in disagreement among each others and some of them , claimed the observation of the scaling @xmath21 expected in the large @xmath22 limit @xcite .",
    "these different papers have been scrutinized in @xcite , where narison found that the apparent discrepancies between the different results can be solved if one applies carefully the stability criteria ( also called sum rule window ) of the results versus the external qssr laplace / moments sum rules variables and continuum threshold @xmath23 . in this way , and for given values of @xmath24 , he obtained the values : f_d(1.310.12)f _  ,   f_b(1.60.1)f _  , [ eq : fdb ] which are independent of the forms of the sum rules used .",
    "however , the result has been quite surprising as it indicates a large violation of the heavy quark symmetry scaling predictions , where @xmath25 corrections have been estimated in @xcite .",

    ", some progresses have been done for improving the qcd expression of the 2-point correlator .",
    "it starts from a confirmation of the svz original expression of the lo perturbative and non - perturbative contributions .",
    "then , broadhurst and generalis @xcite have provided the complete pt @xmath26 nlo including light quark mass corrections .",
    "it has been completed by the pt @xmath27 n2lo corrections of chetyrkin and steinhauser @xcite in the case of one heavy and one massless quarks .",

    "all of these previous qcd expressions have been given in terms of the on - shell quark mass .",
    "in @xcite , narison has used ( for the first time ) the running @xmath28 quark masses in the qssr analysis , by using its known relation with the on - shell mass known at present to nlo @xcite , n2lo @xcite and n3lo @xcite where it has been noticed that the qssr pt expressions converge faster .",
    "it has also been noticed that the values of @xmath20 are very sensitive to the value of @xmath24 motivating him to extract @xmath24 ( for the first time ) from the known values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "recent analysis , including the @xmath27 corrections have been presented in the literature , in the full theory where the running @xmath31 mass has been used @xcite and in hqet  @xcite where the radiative corrections are large due to the uses of the on - shell mass  .",
