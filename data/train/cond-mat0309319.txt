    "a lot of studies have been devoted to the theoretical understanding of statistical and dynamical properties of a weakly interacting bose condensed gas . in particular , many works have been accomplished on the derivation of quantum kinetic equations ( qke ) that govern the evolution of the condensate fraction together with his thermal excitations @xcite . in a simple microscopic model of an homogeneous gas , one can describe the condensate by the atoms that populate the lowest ground state of energy and the thermal excitations by the atoms contained in the excited energy levels .",
    "the population of atoms in each level evolves according to the probability of scattering between the atoms . in the case of a uniform gas , the so - called uehling - uhlenbeck quantum kinetic equation ( uuqke )",
    "is a non - linear integral equation which describes the detailed balance of the population transfer of atoms for each mode of the wave - vector through a binary collision term @xcite .",
    "this term depends linearly on the scattering differential cross section and nonlinearly on the mode population .",
    "it has also the remarkable properties to allow the qke to obey conservation laws .",
    "these laws guarantee that the total number , the total momentum and the total kinetic energy of particles are preserved during the collision processes .",
    "more striking is the law stating that the production of entropy must be always positive , guaranteeing that the system obeys the second law of thermodynamics and , consequently , that it is always dissipative .",
    "this important requirement is known as the boltzmann h - theorem established for a classical gas .",
    "the uuqke has been derived in a weak coupling approximation , valid for a diluted gas for which the kinetic energy is much higher than the potential energy .",
    "the collision term is indeed a second order expansion in the interaction potential between atoms leading to an expression of the differential cross section in the born approximation .",
    "one could use such a qke in a regime below the critical point of condensation .",
    "in particular , for an inhomogeneous gas in a trap potential , the kinetic equation describes the evolution of the wigner function and must contain additional terms , taking into account the free propagation of the atoms , the influence of the external potential and the hartree - fock mean field .",
    "the conservation laws are still valid and allow to express the hydrodynamic equations , including the equation for the local entropy production .    despite these consistencies ,",
    "the resulting qke suffers from the lack of understanding of an important phenomenon : _ superfluidity _ @xcite .",
    "if this phenomenon really exists for a dilute gas @xcite , then the second order theory must necessarily be revisited as it does not take into account the frictionless motion . indeed according to the h - theorem",
    ", the homogeneous gas with a zero total momentum evolves towards a statistical equilibrium state characterized by the bose - einstein particle number distribution @xmath0 $ ] where @xmath1 is the wave - vector , @xmath2 the inverse temperature , @xmath3 the chemical potential , and @xmath4 the particle kinetic energy respectively ( @xmath5 ) . for @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    ", the ground state has a macroscopic population @xmath8 $ ] having no relative velocity with the non condensed part of the gas .",
    "a non zero relative velocity corresponds to a non equilibrium situation and collisions between condensed and non condensed atoms will irrevocably damp this velocity towards zero .    from this observation ,",
    "we conclude that the second order theory is no longer valid as far as superfluidity is concerned .",
    "obviously , at zero temperature , only the potential energy is the dominant contribution since the condensate is at rest and no thermal excitation subsists .",
    "moreover , other indications confirm that an improved description of a weakly interacting bose gas requires a higher order analysis in the interaction parameter . among them , let us mention that the entropy of the condensate must be zero or close to zero while the h - theorem predicts an entropy @xmath9 corresponding to a system in the grand canonical ensemble with large statistical fluctuations of the particle number compared to his average value @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this is due to the bose enhancement factor which stimulates the collision rate in a huge manner as long as a condensed particle is involved in the process . on the other hand ,",
    "the equilibrium statistical approach based on the partition function formalism indicates that the presence of a small interaction lowers considerably the fluctuations to an amount irrelevant in the thermodynamic limit @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "landau was the first to give an explanation of the superfluidity mechanism .",
    "he found a necessary but not sufficient condition for which this phenomenon happens @xcite .",
    "he showed that a superfluid interacting with an external body ( for example the wall ) can not release its energy , unless it evolves with a velocity higher than a critical one .",
    "the argument is based on the impossibility to satisfy the momentum - energy conservation requirement because the excitation emitted by the superfluid has a phonon - like dispersion relation .",
    "attempts to analyze contribution coming from higher terms have been carried out with some success ( see @xcite for a review ) . at zero temperature , bogoliubov has calculated corrections to the ground state energy .",
    "the result is non analytic in the interaction parameter , due to infrared divergencies , and is obtained through a re - summation of an infinite number of contributions .",
    "moreover , the theory predicts the existence of a phonon - like excitation , necessary in order to justify the landau mechanism for superfluidity .",
    "using green function techniques , beliaev improved the description of the phonon like excitation namely by calculating its damping rate .",
    "later on , hugenholtz and pines ( hp ) demonstrated that this excitation must necessarily be gapless .",
    "if at zero temperature , the theory seems well understood and widely accepted , for finite temperature it seems rather controversial .",
    "popov was one of the first to extent the bogoliubov and beliaev works using the matsubara formalism at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "however , this approach is essentially valid for a weakly depleted gas and thus for temperatures much below the critical one @xmath12 . to take into account a strong depletion ,",
    "girardeau derived the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) mean field equations which unfortunately , have , the strong inconvenient of having a gap in the quasi - particle energy spectrum @xcite .    since then , many attempts , have been made , in order to suppress this gap and `` rescue '' the hfb equations , with the purpose to go beyond the bogoliubov phonon - like dispersion relation .",
    "a very popular one is the so - called `` popov approximation '' which consists in suppressing the product of anomalous term in the hfb equations @xcite .",
    "another consists in the renormalization of the hfb equations but at the price of making the approximation of a weakly depleted bose gas @xcite .",
    "consequently , these approaches are only strictly valid for temperatures much below @xmath12 . _",
    "a derivation of a well - defined theory , which is able to describe the weakly interacting bose gas for any regime of temperature , is still an open problem and remains to be established _",
    "( see the conclusion of @xcite ) . by well - defined , we mean that the expansion in the small interaction parameter must be valid , whether the condensate is strongly depleted or not .    nevertheless , using these approaches , qke have been derived taking into account these higher order effects in the collision term .",
    "while some authors use the dispersion relation resulting from the bogoliubov theory @xcite , others use the one resulting form the renormalized hfb theory @xcite .",
    "superfluidity can be achieved in these models .",
    "indeed , the resulting qke can preserve detailed balance even for metastable states , in which a non zero relative velocity persists .",
    "in this situation , the bogoliubov dispersion relation becomes asymmetric - due to a lagrange multiplier representing the relative velocity - and remains non negative , as long as this velocity does not exceed the sound velocity .",
    "otherwise , the dispersion relation is negative and the gas becomes unstable @xcite .",
    "although these models represent a considerable amount of work , they do not yet provide a full account of the conservation laws and the h - theorem that might be deduced from their qke .",
    "however , let us mention that a qke has been proposed valid in principle for temperatures close to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the main problem of this approach is that the dispersion relation has a gap and thus fails to explain the superfluidity .",
    "in general , in all these models , collisions between condensed and non condensed atoms are possible and their rate is huge because of the bose enhancement factor in the same way as in the uuqke . if we follow the same reasoning as above and if an h - theorem really exists , we might expect a condensate entropy of the same order of magnitude @xmath9 . as a consequence ,",
    "the particle number fluctuations of the condensed mode are also huge , in contradiction with estimations made from the partition function formalism @xcite .",
    "the present paper is devoted to provide a possible alternative explanation to the problem of superfluidity in a diluted bose gas . for this purpose",
    "a different qke is derived in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) in which higher order terms in the interaction parameter are retained in the binary collision term ( in some work , the rpa qke refers to the uuqke and thus has a different meaning from this paper @xcite ) .",
    "_ furthermore , in comparison with other approaches , the qke is valid for any regime of temperature below and above @xmath12 since , under no circumstances , the approximation of weak depletion has been used .",
    "_    the rpa is commonly used to describe the collective excitations in the quantum plasma of an electron liquid @xcite . the idea behind",
    "this approximation is to neglect contribution containing average over pair of field operators that are not oscillating in phase but rather randomly . in the terminology of optics , we neglect contribution that are not phase matching .",
    "these contributions come essentially from averages over pairs of different modes which oscillate with a relative random phase .",
    "the reason for using the rpa in a diluted plasma is that , we expect that the excitations propagate over a sufficiently long time that non phase - matching terms are destroyed by interference . by analogy with optics ,",
    "we make somehow the far field approximation .",
    "the analysis of collective excitations in plasma using rpa reveals that the coulombian interaction potential between the electrons is shielded at long distance , due to the dynamic dielectric function .",
    "in fact , these results generalize the debye theory predicting the screening of the potential between a charged ion due to the presence of other surrounding ions . as an extension ,",
    "the rpa includes also the dynamical aspects of these charged particles .",
    "a qke for the plasma has been derived @xcite .",
    "it predicts that the coulombian interaction potential for the cross section is shielded precisely by this dynamic dielectric factor . the classical version of this equation is known as the bgl kinetic equation ( balescu - guernsey - lenard ) @xcite . for deriving it , balescu uses a re - summation of the so - called ring diagrams , which is another approach equivalent to the rpa @xcite .",
    "later on , wyld and pines established a connection between the qke and the plasmon theory @xcite . in their approach , the shielded potential results from a more subtile dynamical mechanism , in which the two electrons must emit and reabsorb an intermediate plasmon during their interaction .",
    "the dispersion relation of the plasmon corresponds precisely to the collective mode of the plasma and its decay rate to the landau damping .    in this paper ,",
    "an identical type of approach will be reproduced in the case of a dilute bose gas .",
    "it is already known that the rpa allows to recover the bogoliubov results for the ground state energy but with one important difference @xcite .",
    "namely , in the rpa , there is no need of a spontaneous breaking of the symmetry @xmath13 but rather , during the derivation , the total particle number is kept conserved .",
    "note that a number - conserving formalism has been already used to derive a qke @xcite .",
    "but this formalism is based on a @xmath14 expansion @xcite and thus differs from the one in the rpa @xcite .",
    "these considerations allow to derive a number conserving qke in which the interaction potential is also modified by the presence of a dynamic dielectric function resulting from collective excitations .",
    "however , in contrast to a plasma , this function presents a strange behavior according to the kind of quasi - particles interaction it mediates .",
    "_ when the interaction involves a particle of the macroscopic condensate , it has the effect to totally annihilate the potential , forbidding any binary collision to occur . _",
    "this surprising result allows to explain why a metastable condensate can not decay into a state of lower energy .",
    "simply , it is forbidden for a particle of the condensate to scatter with the excited particle and to become thus excited .",
    "no exchange of particle can occur between the two fluids .",
    "this unexpected phenomenon is a consequence of the collective behavior induced by the presence of a macroscopic condensate . in short",
    ", collision can not happen because an induced mean field force , generated by the condensate , compensates exactly the interaction force felt by the condensed and non condensed particle .",
    "the net result is the absence of an effective interaction force preventing any scattering . in other words ,",
    "the dielectric function used to attenuate the binary interaction potential becomes simply infinite .",
    "this phenomenon of `` collision blockade '' also influences the mechanism of condensate formation .",
    "since particle can not be exchanged with the macroscopic condensate , other mechanisms must be found .",
    "a closer analysis reveals that the collision blockade happens only when the bose gas is stable . by stable we mean that the collective oscillations are always damped .",
    "precisely , the landau damping plays this role in both a plasma and a condensate as long as we are close to equilibrium @xcite .",
    "however , for some non equilibrium situation , it has been shown for a plasma that the oscillations can grow exponentially leading to an instability @xcite .",
    "such behavior happens also for a bose gas which becomes thus unstable .",
    "for example , we will show that this is the case when the relative velocity between the normal and superfluid is higher than the speed of sound .",
    "in such instable regime , the picture of a collision blockade is no longer valid and the qke gets more complicated .",
    "such more sophisticated qke can describe the exchange of particle with the condensate @xcite and provides an alternative explanation for the condensate formation @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to exchange them on the edge region where the condensate is not macroscopically populated so that scattering can occur . but this requires also a really specific analysis .",
    "therefore , the present qke derived here will not address the important issue of particle exchange with the condensate .",
    "assuming that collision processes are local in space , the derivation can be extended for a weakly inhomogeneous bose gas . in this way",
    ", we recover the generalized gross - pitaevskii equation for the condensate , but with the difference that the absence of a binary collision term in this equation has now a clear justification .",
    "when the normal cloud is in a local thermal equilibrium , no dissipation exists anymore and we can derive a set of coupled equations defining the superfluid regime for any finite temperature below @xmath12 .",
    "the paper is divided as follows .",
    "we first begin by a heuristic approach of the `` collision blockade '' mechanism in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we derive the qke for a homogeneous bose gas .",
    "we review the simple rpa in which only the hartree or direct term is considered and the generalized rpa ( grpa ) in which both hartree and exchange fock terms are considered @xcite .",
    "an equation of motion for the particle - hole pair operator is derived from which the collective and scattering excitation energy spectra are deduced .",
    "the solution of the equation of motion allows to calculate the collision term and to predict the collision blockade phenomenon .",
    "we show that the qke conserves the total particle number , the total momentum and the total energy ( kinetic and hartree - fock ) and that a boltzmann - like h - theorem exists . in section 4",
    ", the reasoning of the previous section is extended to the case of a weakly inhomogeneous bose gas . from the resulting qke , we delimitate the superfluid regime i.e. the regime",
    "in which there is no local production of entropy . in section 5 , by analogy with plasmon theory",
    ", we interpret the collision phenomenon as the result of the exchange of an intermediate boson ( condenson ) . in section 6 ,",
    "we show how the number conserving rpa theory allows to recover the bogoliubov results for the ground state energy .",
    "finally , section 7 is devoted to conclusions and perspectives",
    "we start from the hamiltonian : @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the creation and annihilation operators obeying the commutation relations @xmath18=\\delta_{{\\mathbf{k}},{\\mathbf{k'}}}$ ] @xmath19=[c_{\\mathbf{k}}^\\dagger , c^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k'}}]=0 $ ] .",
    "@xmath20 is the kinetic energy of the particle .",
    "@xmath21 is the interaction potential expressed in fourier transform .",
    "since we are concerned only with low energy binary collisions in the channel @xmath22 , it is common to replace the potential @xmath21 by a pseudo - potential or contact potential that we treat in the born approximation @xcite : @xmath23 \\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the scattering length .",
    "usually we consider only the first linear term in the scattering length .",
    "the second term is ultra - violet divergent and is only present to renormalize the theory by removing eventual high energy divergencies . in what follows",
    "we will concentrate on a repulsive contact interaction @xmath25 .",
    "the so - called annihilation and creation operators of the particle - hole pair are of interest : @xmath26 they represent an excitation of momentum @xmath27 created from a particle which transfers its momentum from @xmath1 to @xmath28 . the kinetic energy transfer for this excitation",
    "is given by @xmath29 .",
    "in particular , we define the density fluctuation operator @xmath30 , the number operator @xmath31 and the total number @xmath32 . in terms of these operators ,",
    "the hamiltonian becomes : @xmath33      assume a macroscopic condensate containing @xmath34 particle evolving with momentum @xmath35 . in the absence of excitations , there are no fluctuations of the density operator i.e. @xmath36 .",
    "suppose that an external potential is turned on creating locally fluctuations of the density of the condensate .",
    "expressing these perturbations in fourier space , we can characterize the external potential @xmath37 and the density fluctuations @xmath38 in terms of its wave - vector @xmath27 and frequencies @xmath39 components .",
    "the hamiltonian created by this external potential is given by @xmath40 the linear response to this potential is given by the formula : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the susceptibility function .",
    "this response function can be calculated formally by treating @xmath43 as a perturbation in the first order . without the presence of a binary interaction potential between the particle ,",
    "this function is given by @xcite : @xmath44 it represents the transition amplitude for a condensed particle to increase its kinetic energy by an amount @xmath45 minus the amplitude for an excited particle to be transferred to the condensate releasing the energy @xmath46 .",
    "an infinitesimal quantity @xmath47 has been added to ensure the convergence and is due to the adiabatic switching process of external perturbation . in the presence of the interaction ,",
    "the condensate acquires a self - interaction potential energy given by @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , according to the rpa , the presence of fluctuation density changes the potential energy by the amount @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the potential induced by the presence of the density fluctuations .",
    "consequently , the global response of the system becomes : @xmath51 comparison between @xmath52 and @xmath53 allows to deduce : @xmath54 the total potential created inside the system @xmath55 is related to the external potential through the dynamical dielectric function : @xmath56 in the electromagnetism language , the gradient of @xmath37 corresponds to the electrical displacement , while the gradient of @xmath57 corresponds to the electric field .",
    "these are respectively the external and total field force acting on the particle .",
    "the dielectric function usually has the effect of attenuating the external field force by means of an induced force so that the total field force is smoothed out . in particular",
    ", we notice that this function is infinitely resonant for frequencies @xmath58 which means that the induced potential exactly compensates the external one . for these frequencies ,",
    "the external potential affects the density fluctuations but has no local influence anymore on the condensate particle itself .",
    "this important observation is at the origin of the collision blockade phenomenon .",
    "indeed , assume that the source of this finite external potential results from the transition of an excited particle of momentum @xmath59 towards another excited state with a momentum @xmath60 .",
    "the released energy during this process is @xmath61 . according to the fermi golden rule",
    ", a collision occurs between the condensed and non condensed ingoing particles if the transfer energy are equal @xmath62 or equivalently the total energy is conserved @xmath63 .",
    "but then , the dielectric function becomes infinitely resonant @xmath64 causing the total potential @xmath65 .",
    "thus the interaction potential felt by the condensate particle becomes non - existent , since the induced mean field cancels the external potential generated by the excited particle .",
    "that precise phenomenon is responsible for the absence of an effective scattering process since , without interaction potential , no scattering amplitude can appear .",
    "the same effect happens when the scattering involves an outgoing particle in the condensate whereas , in such a case , the transfer energy @xmath66 causes the infinite resonance .",
    "thus , these giant resonances have the effect to protect the condensate particle from scattering with the others .",
    "we must notice that this mechanism works only if the condensate population is macroscopic , otherwise , no induced potential is generated in the thermodynamic limit since , for @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "as we shall see in the next sections , a more elaborated model confirms this prediction in the more general case of a non equilibrium bose gas , in which the condensate can be strongly depleted .",
    "many methods have been developed to derive kinetic equations for a dilute bose gas @xcite . in order to arrive rapidly to the final result , instead of using complicated many body techniques , we base the derivation on an operatorial method developed in @xcite which appeared to be a simpler way to reach results without loss of generality .",
    "the approximations are the followings : 1 ) homogeneous bose gas , 2 ) thermodynamic limit , 3 ) generalized rpa , 4 ) instantaneous collisions ( markovian qke ) , 5 ) no fragmentation of the condensate ( only one macroscopic population mode ) .      in this subsection",
    ", we give a brief overview of the rpa developed in @xcite .",
    "this approximation has been used quite extensively for the quantum electron liquid for describing the screening effect .",
    "the dynamic of @xmath69 is given by the heisenberg equation motion .",

    "two cases in the rpa are generally considered in systems close to equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the simple rpa , in which only the hartree or direct terms contribute , and the generalized rpa , in which the fock or exchange terms are also retained .",
    "we shall concentrate on the second approximation , since for a contact potential hartree and fock terms are identical . only for the condensate - condensate interaction",
    ", the fock term does not appear . in the grpa",
    ", we consider that operator @xmath69 with non zero momentum transfer @xmath72 gives a negligible contribution in comparison to @xmath73 , as it involves different modes oscillating with a random relative phase .",
    "the procedure to get the non equilibrium rpa equations is as follows . for a momentum transfer @xmath74 the eq.([he ] ) is kept unchanged . for @xmath72 , however , we keep among all terms those combinations of creation and annihilation operators involving product of @xmath75 and @xmath76 for all possible values of @xmath59 and @xmath77 , and neglect those combinations that can not be written in this form .",

    "however , eq.([rho3 ] ) shows some differences : firstly , since we are dealing with bosons , the fock terms have the opposite sign compared to fermions ; secondly , since a macroscopic condensate might appear , we should be cautious not to count twice terms between the same modes .",
    "we have avoided this difficulty by excluding carefully in the sum over the modes those leading to a double counting and which appear only in the integral terms . finally , another difference is that @xmath88 is still a function depending on the time , generalizing in this way the rpa approach for systems in non equilibrium .    for comparison , zaremba et al .",
    "@xcite have derived a qke in an approximation which would correspond to a different equation for @xmath69 . as we shall see below",

    "<S> from the microscopic theory , we derive a number conserving quantum kinetic equation , valid for a dilute bose gas at any temperature , in which the binary collisions between the quasi - particles are mediated by phonon - like excitations ( called `` condenson '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> this different approach starts from the many - body hamiltonian of a boson gas and uses , in an appropriate way , the generalized random phase approximation . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the collision term of the kinetic equation contains higher order contributions in the expansion in the interaction parameter . </S>",
    "<S> this different expansion shows up that a scattering involves the emission and the absorption of a phonon - like excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the major interest of this particular mechanism is that , in a regime where the condensate is stable , the collision process between condensed and non condensed particles is totally blocked due to a total annihilation of the mutual interaction potential induced by the condensate itself . as a consequence , the condensate is not constrained to relax and can be superfluid . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a boltzmann - like h - theorem for the entropy exists for this equation and allows to distinguish between dissipative and non dissipative phenomena ( like vortices ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also illustrate the analogy between this approach and the kinetic theory for a plasma , in which the excitations correspond precisely to a plasmon . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show the equivalence of this theory with the non - number conserving bogoliubov theory at zero temperature . </S>"
