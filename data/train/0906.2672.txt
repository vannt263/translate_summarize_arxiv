    "the interaction of strong fields with molecules and their molecular ion and isotopic species have been studied extensively ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) . among molecular species ,",
    "the @xmath0-laser interaction remains a subject of particular interest because of the attosecond and femtosecond nuclear time scales and the relatively simple decay channels , showing the way to controlling the motion of electrons in molecules  @xcite .",
    "nonsequential double ionization of @xmath0 has been studied in detail with an emphasis on the rescattering dynamics ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the strong enhancement of nonsequential ( correlated ) double ionization over its sequential ( uncorrelated ) counterpart is one of the most striking surprises in laser - matter interactions .",
    "indeed , at some intensities , double ionization rates can be several orders of magnitude higher than the uncorrelated sequential mechanism leads one to believe .",
    "the hallmark of this strong correlation is the so - called knee of the double ionization probability versus the laser intensity .",
    "an example of a knee is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] for a model of the @xmath0 molecule .",
    "similar knees have been observed in experimental data  @xcite and successfully reproduced by quantal computations on atoms and molecules  @xcite .",
    "different scenarios have been proposed to explain the mechanism behind this enhancement  @xcite . when confronted with experiments  @xcite ,",
    "the recollision scenario  @xcite , in which an ionized electron is hurled back at the core and ionizes the second electron , seems in best accord with observations .",
    "it is generally agreed that the sequential process stems from the action of the laser pulse , whereas the electron - electron correlation is at the essence of the nonsequential process .    while classical mechanics would , at first sight , seem an inappropriate tool for studying this strong - field process , recent classical models  @xcite have been surprisingly successful in capturing key features of the process because of the dominant role of correlation  @xcite . indeed , entirely classical interactions turn out to be adequate to generate the strong two - electron correlation needed for double ionization .",
    "these ideas have been put to the test on the helium atom  @xcite .",
    "a purely classical scenario for the double ionization of the helium atom has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite based on the identification of the organizing centers of the classical dynamics of an effective hamiltonian model . in the current manuscript , we explore the generality of this scenario and in particular how these ideas apply to the double ionization of the @xmath0 molecule driven by a linearly polarized strong laser pulse .",
    "we shall show that the ideas developed fore helium are also applicable here , with some natural variations for the presence of the separated charge centers . in summary ,",
    "the emerging classical scenario for nonsequential double ionization is :    * without the field , the dynamics of @xmath0 is very chaotic and mainly driven by four weakly hyperbolic periodic orbits .",
    "these periodic orbits define an `` inner '' and an `` outer '' electron . * at time @xmath1 , the laser pulse is switched on and focuses its action on the outer electron by pulling it out of the core region . * after half a period of the field , the outer electron is hurled back to the core region and interacts with the inner electron for a very short time .",
    "the interaction , defined as a recollision , transfers energy from the outer to the inner electron .",
    "several outcomes are possible and among them are  : a double ionization where both electrons leave the inner region , a single ionization where one of the electron leaves the nucleus and the other one stays in its neighborhood , an exchange of roles between the inner and the outer electron , or the outer electron proceeding for another recollision . * between two recollisions ,",
    "the inner and outer electrons have their own respective dynamics .",
    "the inner region is mainly influenced by a periodic orbit which has the same period as the laser field . as long as this periodic orbit exists , it organizes an inner region where all the trajectories of the inner electron remain bounded .",
    "this scenario complements the recollision scenario by adding the phase space picture of the inner electron to the one of the outer electron .",
    "the mechanism in phase space allows us to formulate some verifiable predictions of two characteristic intensities of the knee  : the intensity @xmath2 where the nonsequential double ionization is expected to be maximum and the intensity @xmath3 where the double ionization is complete ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) . in comparison with the helium case ,",
    "we highlight the common features but also the differences generated by the two nuclei , and in particular how the predictions depend on the distance between the two nuclei .",
    "we consider a model for @xmath0 where the two nuclei are fixed  @xcite , motivated by the fact that the time scale of electron motion during the laser pulse is short compared to the one characterizing the motion of the heavy nuclei .",
    "more specifically , we consider the following hamiltonian model of the  @xmath4 molecule ( in atomic units ) with soft coulomb potentials  @xcite  : @xmath5 where  @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the positions of the two electrons in a @xmath8-dimensional space , and  @xmath9 ,  @xmath10 are their canonically conjugate momenta , and @xmath11 denotes the euclidean scalar product in @xmath12 and @xmath13 its corresponding norm . here",
    "we consider @xmath14 , 2 and 3 for the computations , but we mainly consider @xmath14 for the phase space analysis since we will see below that it reproduces the same characteristic features as the higher dimensional cases .",
    "the energy is initially fixed at the ground state  @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "the linearly polarized laser field is a sinusoidal pulse modulated by an envelope ,  i.e.  @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a unit vector characterizing the direction of the polarization , @xmath18 is the maximum amplitude and  @xmath19 the laser frequency chosen at  @xmath20 which corresponds to a wavelength of @xmath21  nm .",
    "the pulse envelope  @xmath22 is chosen as a trapezoidal function with 2 - 4 - 2  laser pulse shape ( the ramp - up lasts two cycles , the plateau four and the ramp - down two ) .",
    "we assume the two nuclei are aligned with the laser field and the distance , denoted  @xmath23 , between them is fixed during the whole range of time we will consider  @xcite , so that  @xmath24 where @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "+ typical ionizing trajectories of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) show mainly two qualitatively different routes to double ionization  ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] )  : nonsequential double ionization  ( nsdi ) , where the two electrons leave the core  ( inner ) region at about the same time , and sequential double ionization  ( sdi ) , where one electron leaves the inner region long after the other one has ionized .    using a large assembly of initial conditions , we compute the double ionization probability as a function of the laser intensity @xmath26 ( related to @xmath27 by @xmath28 ) for @xmath14 , 2 and 3 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "this probability curve has the shape of a knee , a hallmark of double ionization .",
    "even if the probability of double ionization is much lower for the three or the two dimensional model , one can see that characteristic features ( the localization of the knee and the intensity where double ionization is complete ) happen at about the same intensities .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the one - dimensional case in what follows in order to obtain some information on these intensities and the mechanisms behind nsdi and sdi .",
    "we first analyze the dynamics of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) without the field  ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this hamiltonian system has two degrees of freedom , and therefore lends itself very well to an analysis using poincar sections .",
    "here we use a different tool to analyze the dynamics , by considering the linear stability properties such as obtained by the finite - time lyapunov ( ftl ) exponents  @xcite .",
    "these ftl exponents are obtained by integrating the tangent flow together with the equations of motion for @xmath30  : @xmath31 where eq .",
    "( [ eq_motion ] ) are the equations of motion , and eq .",
    "( [ tangent_flow ] ) is the tangent flow where @xmath32 is the matrix of variations of the generalized velocity field @xmath33 at the point  @xmath34 and time @xmath35 , i.e.  @xmath36 .",
    "the initial condition for the integration of the tangent flow is @xmath37 , the four dimensional identity matrix .",
    "the ( maximum ) ftl exponent at time @xmath35 for the initial conditions @xmath38 is equal to @xmath39 where  @xmath40 is the eigenvalue of the jacobian matrix @xmath41 at time  @xmath35 with the largest norm .",
    "the way to analyze the dynamics using these exponents is to represent maps of ftl exponents as functions of the initial conditions @xmath38 at a fixed time @xmath35 .",
    "these maps ( called ftl maps ) quantify the ( linear ) instability of some regions and highlight invariant objects . a typical ftl map is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] for hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) without the field .",
    "it clearly displays strong and global chaos by showing fine details of the stretching and folding of trajectories  @xcite .",
    "a closer inspection shows some regions associated with a very small ftl exponents ( blue regions and lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "a poincar section reveals the presence of an elliptic island which surrounds an elliptic periodic orbit @xmath42 , represented on fig .",
    "[ fig : po ] with a black curve .",
    "however such regions are too small to play a major role in the dynamics of a typical trajectory .",
    "in fact , the motion without the field is guided by four weakly hyperbolic periodic orbits .",
    "these four important periodic orbits are denoted  @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and  @xmath46 , and the projections of @xmath43 and @xmath45 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : po ] .",
    "these four periodic orbits are obtained from one single periodic orbit through the symmetries of the equations of motion :  @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "it also means that the representation of these orbits on the plane  @xmath49 can be deduced from the one on the plane  @xmath50 by inverting the coordinates  @xmath51 and  @xmath52 .",
    "the two periodic orbits  @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( stretched in the @xmath51-direction ) have an outer projection in the @xmath53 plane and an inner one in the @xmath54 plane ( see the red curves in fig .",

    "the same holds for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , swapping the role of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "figure  [ fig : distpo ] represents the distance of a typical trajectory with the four periodic orbits mentioned above .",
    "it shows that at each time , the trajectory is close to one of these orbits with rapid transitions between them .",
    "this means that the motion on each of these periodic orbits , and consequently of a typical trajectory , is composed of one electron moving close to the nucleus ( the inner electron ) and the other one further moving away ( the outer electron ) , with quick exchanges of the roles of each electron .",
    "the reason why these hyperbolic periodic orbits are important is that they are short and weakly hyperbolic periodic orbits ( their greene residue  @xcite is equal to @xmath55 ) .",
    "hence a typical trajectory passing nearby one of these orbits mimics ( by continuity ) the motion on the periodic orbit and then slowly escapes ( depending on its escape rate and hence on its stability properties ) from this orbit following its unstable manifold .",

    "second , most of the inner tori are broken by the field , creating a bounded chaotic region between the two nuclei .",
    "these two types of trajectories ( regular and bounded chaotic ) do not ionize .",
    "third , the outermost invariant tori are broken since the motion is unbounded sufficiently far away from the nuclei .",
    "these are the ionizing trajectories . during a full laser cycle , we expect two types of non - ionizing trajectories represented on fig .",

    ", the picture of the phase space of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h2 ] ) evolves in the following way  : if the laser intensity  @xmath26 is too small , then the phase space is surrounded by invariant tori  ( with a bounded chaotic region between the two nuclei ) and no sequential double ionization can occur .",
    "the sequential double ionization probability depends the on the size of the regular region , and hence on  @xmath26 . for large values of the intensity ,",
    "the regular zone vanishes and after some critical intensity , after which there are no invariant tori bounding the motion of the inner electron .",
    "consequently , only sequential double ionization is observed in this high intensity regime .",
    "more specifically , the size of the region where the trajectories are bounded is quantified by @xmath64 ( defined as the maximum position @xmath52 of the outermost invariant torus of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h2 ] ) on the poincar section ) . a numerical approximation to @xmath64 is obtained by integrating trajectories at @xmath65 ( since the domain is approximately symmetric with respect to @xmath65 ) and monitoring the ones which do not keep a bounded value for the position after the duration of the laser pulse .",
    "this numerical estimate of @xmath64 versus the intensity @xmath26 is represented on fig .  [ fig : fig_ym ] ( continuous curve ) .    a rough approximation to  @xmath66",

    "however , this is an upper bound since complete double ionization appears to happen at smaller intensities .",
    "this emerges from the numerical computation of @xmath64 where the size of the regular zone drops to zero for intensities larger than @xmath70 .",
    "the origin of this phenomenon is explained by looking at the central periodic orbit which organizes the bounded motion .",
