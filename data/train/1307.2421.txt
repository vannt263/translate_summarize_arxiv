    "green wireless communication has attracted a lot of interest recently due to the explosive growth of energy consumption of wireless communication networks and correspondingly increasing carbon dioxide ( co@xmath1 ) emissions . in order to achieve this green goal ,",
    "many innovative techniques among different layers of communication protocols have been proposed @xcite . among others , increasing the physical layer bits - per - joule energy efficiency ( ee ) , which is in general defined as the achievable data rates divided by the power consumption ,",
    "has received increasing attention these days ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in @xcite , a general link level ee optimization framework is proposed based on fractional programming techniques . in @xcite , the ee maximization of a downlink orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) is addressed . in @xcite ,",
    "ee optimization for a multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) broadcast channel is considered , where transmit covariance optimization and antenna selection technique are jointly applied to maximize the ee . in @xcite , base station ( bs ) sleeping is employed to improve the ee of cooperative multi - cell wireless systems .",
    "on the other hand , interference is the key factor limiting the performance of cellular networks in terms of both spectrum efficiency ( se ) and ee . in order to mitigate the inter - cell interference ,",
    "implementing bs cooperation is a promising solution .",
    "the bs cooperation can be mainly classified into two categories , namely joint processing and coordinated beamforming , where the former performs symbol - level cooperation with both transmit message and channel state information ( csi ) sharing , and the latter performs beamforming - level cooperation with csi sharing only . in this paper , we focus on coordinated beamforming .",
    "there have been some works in the literature studying the optimal coordinated beamforming design ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in @xcite , the transmit power minimization with minimum signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio ( sinr ) constraints is considered by applying uplink - downlink duality techniques . in @xcite , the pareto boundary of the se regions",
    "is characterized for multi - cell miso systems .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the optimal beamforming vectors can be chosen as linear combinations of the zero - forcing ( zf ) and the maximum - ratio transmission ( mrt ) beamformers , while in @xcite , the se pareto boundary characterizing problem is solved by reformulating it as convex optimization problems .",
    "furthermore , distributed algorithms to achieve the se pareto boundary are developed in @xcite . however , these previous works all focus on the se perspective . to our best knowledge , there are only @xcite considering energy efficient coordinated transmission in multi - cell systems . in @xcite ,",
    "a single - antenna ofdm multi - cell system is considered , for which an energy - efficient power optimization is developed based on non - cooperative games . in @xcite ,",
    "an energy efficient beamforming algorithm is derived for mimo interference channels , for which local optimality is achieved .    in this paper , we investigate the optimal energy efficient coordinated beamforming for multi - cell miso systems with @xmath0 multiple - antenna base stations ( bs ) and @xmath0 single - antenna mobile stations ( ms ) , where each bs sends information to its own intended ms with cooperatively designed transmit beamforming .",
    "we assume single user detection at the ms by treating the interference as noise . by taking into account a realistic power consumption model at the bs",
    ", we characterize the pareto boundary of the achievable ee region of the @xmath0 links , in which the ee of each link is defined as the achievable data rate at the ms divided by the total power consumption at the bs .",
    "characterizing this boundary can reveal the fundamental ee tradeoffs among different links in interference networks , and thus is very important .",
    "nonetheless , since the achievable date rate at each ms is a non - concave function due to the coupled mutual interference , the ee of each link is a non - concave function over an affine function , which makes characterizing this boundary very challenging .",
    "fortunately , we find that through relating this multi - cell miso system to cognitive radio ( cr ) channels by using the concept of interference temperature ( it ) , the original problem can be transformed into a set of parallel concave fractional programming problems .",
    "then , by applying the fractional programming technique , we solve the reformulated problems globally optimally , and correspondingly develop a parameterized characterization of the ee pareto boundary in terms of the it levels",
    ". based on this characterization , we further develop a distributed coordinated beamforming algorithm , which iteratively solves a set of fractional programs . through simulations , we show that this distributed algorithm can achieve the ee pareto boundary for the multi - cell miso systems .",

    "we consider a downlink multi - cell miso system with @xmath0 bss and @xmath0 mss , where each bs serves its intended ms by cooperatively designed transmit beamforming .",
    "we assume that the @xmath17th bs is equipped with @xmath18 antennas , @xmath19 , and each ms is equipped with only one single antenna .",
    "let @xmath20 denote the channel vector from bs @xmath21 to ms @xmath17 , and @xmath22 denote the transmitted signal of the @xmath17th bs , then the signal received by ms @xmath17 is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the noise at the @xmath17th ms , which is modeled as a circularly symmetric complex gaussian ( cscg ) random variable with zero mean and variance @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26 .",
    "we assume that the independent gaussian codebook is used at each bs , i.e. , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the covariance of @xmath29 with @xmath30 , and @xmath29 s are independent .",

    "then the total power consumption at the @xmath17th bs is given as @xmath35 thus , we can define the ee of the @xmath17th link , i.e. , the link between the @xmath17th bs and the @xmath17th ms , as the achievable rate at ms @xmath17 divided by the total power consumption of bs @xmath17 : @xmath36 accordingly , we define the achievable ee region as the set of all ee tuples that can be achieved under a set of power constraints , denoted by @xmath37 : @xmath38 in this paper , our objective is to characterize the ee pareto boundary or find the pareto optimal ee tuples , which is the outer boundary of the ee region given in ( [ eq5 ] ) . more precisely , we can define the pareto optimality of the ee as follows :    _ definition 1 _ : an ee tuple @xmath39 is pareto optimal if there is no other tuples @xmath40 satisfying @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( the inequalities are component - wise ) at the same time",

    "we also denote @xmath56 as the optimal objective value of problem ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "it can be easily verified that the feasible region @xmath55 is convex , and the objective of ( [ eq6 ] ) is a concave function over an affine function , thus problem ( [ eq6 ] ) is a concave fractional program @xcite . moreover , from [ 16 ] , it also follows that the objective function in ( [ eq6 ] ) is pseudo - concave , so the maximum for problem ( [ eq6 ] ) is unique , i.e. , any local optimal point is globally optimal . in order to solve problem ( [ eq6 ] ) , we apply the technique of concave fractional programming @xcite and relate it to a parametric convex program by separating the numerator and denominator of the objective function . by introducing a parameter @xmath57",
