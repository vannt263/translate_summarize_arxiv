    "the manifolds in the ensemble of two - dimensional quantum gravity have a rich structure which can be characterized in a number of different ways . in particular there are several different quantities which in the case of smooth regular manifolds take the same value and correspond to the usual notion of dimension . when computed for manifolds which are far from regular these quantities , which in fact probe different aspects of the geometry , can yield different values .",
    "the hausdorff dimension @xmath4 is defined through the volume , @xmath5 of an annulus of geodesic thickness @xmath6 at geodesic distance @xmath7 from a point by @xmath8 on the other hand the spectral dimension @xmath9 describes the properties of a random walk , generated by the diffusion equation , on the manifold .",
    "a walker sets off from a point p ; the probability that after making @xmath10 steps ( a step is defined as a move from one lattice point to a neighbouring one in discretized quantum gravity ) he has returned to p is @xmath11 provided that @xmath12 to avoid finite size and discretization effects respectively . for smooth regular two dimensional manifolds @xmath13 .",
    "the spectral dimension has been determined for various two - dimensional quantum gravity systems by monte carlo simulation , scaling relations , and exact calculation . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that for the generic branched polymer ensemble @xmath14 whereas the corresponding hausdorff dimension is 2 @xcite . using the same method we have now extended the calculation to the non - generic branched polymers @xcite .",
    "the branched polymer ensembles have a grand canonical partition function @xmath15 given by @xcite @xmath16 which is non - analytic as @xmath17 with behaviour @xmath18 for generic branched polymers ( a finite number of @xmath19 non - zero , and all positive ) we get @xmath20 ; the multi - critical bps ( at least @xmath21 @xmath22s non - zero and specially tuned ) have @xmath23 with @xmath24 and the continuous critical bps have any @xmath25 at the expense of having an infinite number of the @xmath22s non - zero .",
    "our calculation of @xmath26 for the non - generic bps @xcite follows the method of @xcite ; the main generalization is that the generating function for the return probabilities on _ any _ branched polymer a can always be expressed in terms of those for its constituents @xmath27 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "letting @xmath28 we find that @xmath29 the main result that we prove is that defining @xmath30 then @xmath31 has the asymptotic behaviour @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 , the sum over a runs over all bps , @xmath34 is the number of links in a , and @xmath35 the weight for a in the graphical expansion of ( 3 ) ) .",
    "this is done by induction on @xmath36 and @xmath37 and using ( 6 ) to generate the derivatives .    using this result we can compute the asymptotic expansion of the grand canonical generating function @xmath38 taking the nth derivative of ( 10 ) and setting @xmath39 yields a sum of terms which are precisely the @xmath40 .",
    "thus we are able to show that ( supposing for a moment that the taylor series is convergent about @xmath39 , and dropping a trivial pole term ) @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "in fact the taylor series is not convergent , nor is it borel summable .",
    "however it is possible to prove @xcite that it is an asymptotic series with an integral representation which has no unphysical singularities in the region of interest .",
    "the absence of borel summability means that this integral representation is not unique ; however it can only differ from the true result by terms involving essential singularities which vanish at @xmath39 .",
    "since @xmath44 has ordinary non - analytic behaviour at @xmath39 these possible essential singularities can have no effect on the physics .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the critical behaviour of @xmath44 is related to the spectral dimension through @xmath45 when @xmath0 we find that @xmath1 .",
    "this is of course consistent with the previously known result for the generic case .",
    "it also shows that the spectral dimension is not an independent critical exponent for these models  it is completely determined by @xmath46 . for the models with @xmath47 ( for which @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) we find that @xmath3 always",
    "this is the same as the value now established for the quantum gravity phase @xcite but this is a coincidence .",
    "the negative @xmath46 bps are rather pathological objects being very bushy ( this is the effect of the dominance of the high order branching in ( 3 ) ) and there is no sense in which the walker is really `` diffusing '' ; in reality he is just going backwards and forwards along the short branches of the bush .",
    "one can not deduce from the coincidence of @xmath9 that negative @xmath46 bps are the same as the quantum gravity phase !"
