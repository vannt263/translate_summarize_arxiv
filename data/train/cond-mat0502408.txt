    "[ sec1 ] a quantity of central importance for finite - size scaling ( fss ) analyses of critical phenomena is the order - parameter distribution @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "most properties of @xmath0 at criticality are known from computer simulations @xcite .",
    "analytical information comes from field theoretic renormalization group calculations @xcite , conformal field theory @xcite , and also a generalized classification theory of phase transitions  @xcite . while some of the analytical predictions seem to have been corroborated by numerical simulations  @xcite , the predictions for the tails of the critical order - parameter distribution could not be confirmed .",
    "recording of the very small probabilities in the tails requires special techniques such as multicanonical simulations @xcite .",
    "many recent studies @xcite have attempted this , but failed in establishing the true behaviour of the tails of @xmath0 .",
    "+    in the present paper we report results of high precision multicanonical monte carlo simulations for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) ising model on square lattices with fixed ( i.e. all boundary spins fixed to @xmath1 ) boundary conditions .",
    "one of the objectives is to study whether the order - parameter distribution obtained from the simulation can be considered to be asymptotic with respect to system size .",
    "a secondary objective is to study fixed ( symmetry breaking ) boundary conditions because the asymmetry should give rise to an asymmetry in the far tail behaviour .",
    "we consider the 2d ising model on a square lattice with @xmath2 spins @xmath3 interacting according to the usual hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the ferromagnetic coupling strength and the summation @xmath6 runs over all nearest neighbour pairs on the lattice .",
    "the order parameter is the magnetization per spin , @xmath7 . in the following we set @xmath8 , the boltzmann constant to unity and denote the temperature by @xmath9 .",
    "the probability density @xmath0 of the order parameter depends parametrically on temperature and system size , @xmath10 . at criticality ,",
    "traditional fss predicts the scaling form @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 with @xmath13 is a universal scaling function . since for the 2d ising model @xmath14 and @xmath15 ,",
    "the scaling variable is thus @xmath16 .",
    "for the analysis of the tails of @xmath0 we first determine constants @xmath17 such that @xmath18 has mean zero , unit norm and unit variance .",
    "then we split the peak into its left and right tails by defining the functions @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the position of the maximum .",
    "to exhibit stretched exponential tails we finally calculate the logarithmic derivatives @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and plot them against @xmath23 . in this representation ,",
    "tails of the form @xmath24 $ ] lead to a plateau at the value @xmath25 for large @xmath26 . a standard gaussian distribution @xmath27 thus approaches asymptotically the value 2 .",
    "we performed multicanonical simulations @xcite by flattening the probability distribution of the magnetization for system sizes up to @xmath28 at three characteristic temperatures .",
    "the right tails in the high - temperature phase at @xmath29 are shown in the upper left plot of fig .  1 . with increasing system size the distribution approaches gaussian behaviour as is expected from the central limit theorem for a finite correlation length @xmath30 = 1.41235\\dots$ ] . in fact , assuming heuristically that there are effectively @xmath31 uncorrelated spins with @xmath32 ( @xmath33 for @xmath34 )",
    ", we obtain the very similar looking curves in the upper right plot of fig .  1 , explaining the finite - size effects .    at the critical temperature @xmath35",
    ", theory predicts a right tail of the form @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the equation of state exponent , leading to a plateau at 16 @xcite .",
    "our data shown in the lower left plot of fig .  1",
    "reveal a shoulder developing with increasing @xmath38 .",
    "the convergence , however , is extremely slow @xcite .",
    "the solid line is a fit using this theoretical prediction , @xmath39 with @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .    for low temperatures",
    "the magnetization is close to unity . at @xmath43",
    "a true peak starts developing only for system sizes @xmath44 , and even for @xmath45 only five data points exist to the right of the peak , cf .",
    "[ fig : rescaled_lowt ] .",
    "we therefore found only weak evidence for gaussian behaviour with increasing @xmath38 for the right tails @xcite . here the left tails shown in the lower right plot of fig .",
    "1 are more interesting . near the peak ( i.e. for small @xmath26 ) we see a narrow regime over which the curves approach gaussian behaviour as one would expect again from the central limit theorem . in the intermediate range of @xmath26 ,",
    "the curves show a plateau at @xmath46 , corresponding to a fat stretched exponential @xmath47 .",
    "this represents the well known droplet regime predicted analytically @xcite .",
    "we observed this stretched exponential tail in the distributions for low temperatures all the way up to @xmath48 .",
    "for periodic boundary conditions the stretched exponential tails eventually cross over into a flat bottom , reflecting phase coexistence on finite lattices governed by strip - like spin configurations . for fixed boundary conditions the same stretched exponential tail is terminated by a cutoff function .",
    "visually the three different regimes can also easily be identified in the logarithmic plot of @xmath49 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rescaled_lowt ] .",
    "to summarize , the order - parameter distribution at the critical point is found to approach its asymptotic universal scaling function extremely slowly .",
    "this is also true for periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "our extrapolations discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that the required system sizes ( @xmath50 ) are beyond present day numerical resources even for the 2d ising model ."
