    "uncertainty still remains as to the distance of ngc  6503-d1 , but based on its proximity and other supporting evidence the dwarf is most likely associated with ngc  6503 .",
    "ngc  6503 shows very extended ultraviolet emission far beyond the edge of its optical disk @xcite .",
    "such extended ultraviolet ( xuv ) disks indicate sf at a very low density @xcite and are quite common ( residing in @xmath2330% of nearby galaxies ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the trigger of the xuv activity still remains unknown ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "ngc  6503-d1 is the first dwarf satellite discovered during the early observations of the subaru - xuv survey , a deep optical imaging survey of nearby xuv disks using the subaru telescope .",
    "the dwarf galaxy was discovered in deep imaging of the spiral galaxy ngc  6503 using the the subaru prime focus camera ( suprime - cam ; * ? ? ?",

    "the observations were performed in june and july 2013 and supplemented with archival data taken in july 2012 .",
    "the field of ngc  6503 was observed in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and na656 ( h@xmath4 ) bands , among which the images in @xmath1 and @xmath3 were deeper .",
    "the typical seeing was 0.8@xmath27 .",

    "however , we also found a smooth , extended , and symmetric stellar distribution in logarithmic scale ( panel c ; @xmath1 band example ) , which is perhaps a more accurate representation of the stellar mass distribution . panel ( e ) shows the continuum - subtracted h@xmath4 image .",
    "emission is detected at one spot within the dwarf .",
    "the presence of the resolved bright stars and the @xmath8 region indicate that this dwarf hosts recent / current sf and , by implication , some gas , though no hi gas was detected at the @xmath30 upper limit of @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "we classify this as a transition - type dsph / dirr , based on traditional definitions @xcite , the type between dwarf irregular ( dirr ) and dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) .",
    "we note , however , that there is a discussion on whether dirrs and dsphs are physically distinct , the only difference being their current / recent sf which outshines the other populations and gives the impression of an irregular morphology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the h@xmath4 detection also supports its proximity to ngc  6503 , though the heliocentric velocity of ngc  6503 ( @xmath16 ) is very close to mw s and it is difficult to distinguish between ngc  6503 and the mw .",

    "the structural properties of the new dwarf are , therefore , typical of faint dwarf galaxies in the local group and in some other nearby systems .",
    "the high spatial resolution of the subaru images ( @xmath83 ) permits identification and photometry of individual bright stars within ngc  6503-d1 .",
    "we made an initial catalog of 312 potential detections using the daophot psf photometry software @xcite .",
    "we then manually rejected apparent misidentifications ( e.g. , background galaxies and tails between adjacent bright stars ) , leaving 303 stars , which are identified in figure [ fig : cmd]a .",
    "we performed photometry in @xmath1 and @xmath3 bands , made a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ; _ middle _ ) and a histogram of apparent @xmath3 magnitude for stars with @xmath84 ( _ right _ ) .",
    "theoretical isochrones are superimposed on the cmd assuming a distance of ngc  6503 ( @xmath85 ) and were taken from the padova and trieste stellar evolutionary tracks @xcite .",
    "the red isochrones are at an age of 10 gyr for metallicities of @xmath86 -2.0 , -1.5 , -1.0 , and -0.5 from the left to right .",
    "the others are for @xmath87 - 0.5 and at @xmath88})$]=7 to 10 ( see legend ) .",
    "the bright stars that we identified are around the areas of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , horizontal branch ( hb ) , and red giant branch ( rgb ) sequences .",
    "therefore , the dwarf hosts multiple stellar populations , from young ( @xmath23100 myr , cyan isochrone ) to old ( @xmath898 - 10 gyr , magenta and red ) .",
    "many stars in the recently formed population must have escaped their natal dust given the agreement between unreddened isochrones and our photometry , especially regarding the blue limit of the he - core - burning population .",
    "the rgb sequence depends on stellar metallicity ( red lines ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "the spread on the red side may indicate a variety of metallicity in the underlying stellar population .",
    "the tip of rgb ( trgb ) stars are often used as a distance indicator , as their luminosities are approximately constant near the @xmath3 band wavelength @xcite . by averaging the four red isochrones in figure [ fig : cmd]b we determined a trgb magnitude of @xmath903.53 ab mag in the subaru @xmath3 band . if the dwarf is a companion of ngc  6503 , the corresponding apparent magnitude is @xmath91 with an error of at least @xmath92 carried over from the distance modulus .",
    "within the errors , this is roughly where we see the rise in the histogram ( figure [ fig : cmd]c ; @xmath84 for trgb color ) , though the sample is small .",
    "this supports the assumption that the dwarf is a companion of ngc  6503 .",

    "conventionally , galaxies sizes have been defined by the 25@xmath93 isophote level .",
    "the distribution of resolved stars in the cmd suggests multiple stellar populations , indicating that sf has persisted for a long period of time .",
    "figure [ fig : images]e shows the detection of one @xmath8 region ( small circle ) within the dwarf at @xmath94 significance .",
    "the @xmath8 region is virtually co - incident with the brightest spot in nuv ( galex j175247.4 + 700811 ; figure [ fig : images]d ) , indicating current sf in this lsb galaxy .",
    "[ the brightest h@xmath4 spot at nw without nuv emission is unlikely to be in the dwarf , since it would be too bright . ]",
    "the sf activity of this @xmath8 region is low , which is inferred from its faint h@xmath4 luminosity of @xmath95 .",
    "this was measured within an @xmath96-diameter aperture centered at ( @xmath97 , @xmath98 ) = ( 17:52:47.1,+70:08:09.8 ) with correction for galactic extinction .",
    "the uncertainty is about a factor of 2 due to a sensitivity to continuum subtraction ( the fraction of h@xmath4 over total emission in the na656 band is @xmath235% in the aperture ) .",
    "the contamination of [ nii ] @xmath99 6548 , 6583 emission is likely negligible ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is consistent with observations of the orion nebula in the milky way , which is about 10 times brighter in @xmath100 with only a single o5.5v type star as a dominant ionizing source . the second brightest stars in orion ( one o9.5v , two b0.5v , and one b3 ; * ?",
    "* ) together emit @xmath103-@xmath104 times fewer lyman continuum photons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the dwarf galaxy is unlikely to be hosting any appreciable o - star population at the current time , assuming that the leakage of ionizing photons is not dominant ( @xmath105 of the lyman continuum photons need to leak away without ionizing the surrounding gas to hide an o - star ) .",
    "of course , it could have had o - star(s ) a short time ago as their lifetimes are short ( @xmath103 myr ) .",
    "the stars around this hii region are agb and blue loop stars ( figure [ fig : cmd ] ) . one , or some , of these may be the ionizing source if an internal extinction is locally large ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "the observed colors of the dwarf ( table [ tab : prop ] ) also indicate multiple epochs of sf .",
    "rigorous analyses of sf history ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are beyond our scope , and a dwarf galaxy of small mass requires stochasticity in sf to be taken into account ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . instead",
    ", we adopt a simplistic approach to illustrate that at least two stellar populations , old and young , are necessary to account for the observed colors , and that most of the stellar mass is old .",
    "we adopted starburst99 @xcite , a kroupa initial mass function , a metallicity of @xmath107 , and an internal extinction @xmath108 for the integrated colors of the dwarf .",
    "these choices were made arbitrarily for demonstration ; for example , the metallicity may have a range from a low @xmath109 up to @xmath110 according to figure [ fig : cmd ] ( the data with respect to the rgb isochrones ) .",
    "figure [ fig : spec]a shows that neither a model of single starburst at any age nor continuous sf alone reproduces the fuv - nuv and v - i colors simultaneously unless @xmath74 is unusually high .",
    "figure [ fig : spec]b shows an example of stellar populations at the young and old ages of 300 myr and 12 gyr .",
    "the young population ( blue ) is relatively bright in fuv and nuv and shows a flat spectrum in the redder , optical range ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 ) .",
    "the old population ( green ) contributes negligibly in the fuv and nuv and shows a rising spectrum in the optical bands .",
    "the dwarf is relatively bright in fuv and nuv ( requiring a young stellar population ) and shows a rising trend in the optical bands ( old stellar population ) .",
    "the masses of stellar populations determine the zero point in magnitudes : the old component carries the most mass ( @xmath111 ; insensitive to the actual age if @xmath112 gyr ) as compared to the young one ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "the total stellar mass within the dwarf is approximately @xmath114 .",

    "its structural properties are similar to those of the local group dwarfs .",
