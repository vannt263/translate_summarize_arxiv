    "@xcite the number of edge states corresponds to the chern number @xmath1 of the filled electronic band and implies the famous quantized hall conductivity @xmath2 . the description of the quantum hall effect by topological invariants @xcite is eventually based on the berry phase @xcite .    in order to mimic the integer quantum hall effect in a lattice model _ without _ external magnetic field haldane proposed the first chern insulator @xcite .",
    "in addition to nearest - neighbor hopping on a honeycomb lattice , the so called haldane model comprises a staggered magnetic flux which induces complex next - nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "the translational symmetry is preserved .",
    "averaged over a whole unit cell the magnetic flux vanishes .",
    "however , for certain values of the phases a finite magnetic field can not be distinguished from a vanishing average magnetic field because phases of multiples of @xmath3 can not be distinguished from zero phases @xcite .    in order to realize a chern insulator the time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) must be broken .",
    "non - trival chern numbers imply chiral edge states also in absence of an external magnetic field in contrast to the quantum hall effect . in the context of topologically protected edge states the term ` chiral ' means that the electrons only propagate along one edge in one direction .",
    "if no magnetic field is involved the effect is called the _ anomalous _ quantum hall effect .",
    "the kane - mele model @xcite represents an extension of the haldane model in which the spin degree of freedom is added .",
    "this makes the preservation of the trs possible because one spin species realizes the time - reversed replica of the other .",
    "the kane - mele model was suggested to describe the effect of spin - orbit interaction on the electronic band structure of graphene in the low energy regime , but it turned out that the spin - orbit interaction in graphene is too weak to produce noticeable effects .",
    "nevertheless , the kane - mele model provides fascinating theoretical insights .    due to the fact that the kane - mele model preserves the trs it can not display a net charge current at the edges .",
    "instead , a net spin current at the edges is possible .",
    "this is called the quantum spin hall effect ( qshe ) which can be attributed to the @xmath0 invariant @xcite implying helical edge states @xcite .",
    "these topologically protected edge states are called ` helical ' because they have a spin filtering property , i.e. , the propagate in one direction while the spins @xmath4 propagate in the opposite direction along the same edge . as a result",
    ", the qshe implies a quantization of the spin hall conductivity .",
    "since the qshe is too weak in graphene to be measurable , bernevig , hughes , and zhang proposed a model @xcite for the qsh phase in quantum wells where the spin - orbit coupling is much stronger .",
    "soon after the theoretical proposal the qsh phase has been observed experimentally in a 2d / quantum well @xcite .",

    "the calculated energy gap of the low - buckled honeycomb structure of germanium results from the stronger spin - orbit coupling so that this system is a candidate for the realization of the kane - mele model .",

    "a chern insulator was considered unlikely to be realized .",
    "but very recently , progress has been achieved towards 2d chern insulators .",
    "the first observation of the anomalous quantum hall effect was made in thin ferromagnetic chern insulators @xcite .",
    "it could be observed up temperatures of a few kelvin .",
    "theoretical proposals indicate that chern insulators near room temperature in thin ferromagnetic chern insulators @xcite or in super - lattices of gold atoms on single - vacancy graphene @xcite are possible .",
    "an alternative realization has been achieved using ultracold fermionic atoms in a periodically modulated optical lattice @xcite .",
    "this method could implement the haldane model in a physical system .",
    "a particular asset is the tunability of the physical properties .",
    "due to their topological protection , edge states may carry currents without dissipation and are protected against disorder to some extent , see below .",
    "this robustness makes them attractive to applications . with this long - time goal in mind , we set out to study the influence of controllable external parameters on the transport behavior of topological edge state as well as the effect of non - controllable features such as disorder .",
    "this is what we undertake in the present work .",
    "the fermi velocity is a key quantity in transport behavior representing the group velocity of a transmitted charge or spin signal .",
    "thus , we aim at tuning the fermi velocity .",
    "a previous observation in the kagome lattice @xcite revealed that the fermi velocity depends on the selected shape of the edge .",
    "further investigations in the haldane model @xcite showed that by decorating one edge of the honeycomb lattice the fermi velocity can be influenced strongly .",
    "we extend this observation by considering decorating both edges showing the independence of the chiral edge modes explicitly .",
    "next , we transfer the idea of decoration to the kane - mele model , i.e. , to helical edge states .",
    "an explicit rashba coupling @xcite and its effect on the fermi velocity is also studied .",
    "the decoration of the edges of the kane - mele model leads to a tunable spin - dependent fermi velocity which suggests to use it in spintronics @xcite .    finally , we study the influence of local disorder on the edge states .",
    "since edge modes are due to non - trivial topological invariants it is assumed that they are protected against disorder .",
    "however , various experiments show that the signatures of topological phases are clearer in high - purity samples @xcite than in samples of lower quality .",
    "thus , we intend to investigate the influence of disorder in explicit calculations . for simplicity , we study the robustness the chiral edge states in the haldane model on the honeycomb lattice .",

    "the observed dependence on @xmath102 can be understood as follows .",

    "the successfully reconstructed dispersion is displayed in .        for stronger disorder ,",
    "a complete reconstruction of the dispersion of the edge states turns out not to be possible , see .",
    "for instance for @xmath116 the eigen states with energies within the flat dispersion in the center of the gap can not be mapped reliably to the corresponding momenta because their overlap falls below the threshold . as expected from our perturbative argument ,",
    "the states in the flatter regions of the dispersion are not particularly robust against disorder .",
    "note that this does not contradict to the general idea of topological protection because there are modes at arbitrary small energies .",
    "but for transmitting signals one needs a clearly defined dispersion @xmath168 which yields the group velocity @xmath169 .",
    "if this is not the case as we found here for stronger disorder we presume that the system is not suitable for applications based on signal transmission .",
    "this sets certain limits to the general idea of topological protection which should not be misunderstood as a guarantee that dispersion and group velocity are well - defined .",
    "first , we investigated the decorated haldane model by explicit calculations of its edge states .",
    "the goal was to study the effects that various parameters of the decorations have on the properties of the edge states , most notably on their dispersion .",
    "a particular asset is that a gate voltage shifting the energy of all decorating sites provides a tunable control of the fermi velocity .",
    "the fermi velocity is direction - dependent if the different edges are decorated and tuned independently .",
    "the application of this phenomenon in tunable delay lines has been proposed @xcite .",
    "second , the results for the spinless haldane model were extended to the spinful kane - mele model . in this model ,",
    "the dispersions of the edge modes depend on the combination of direction and spin .",
    "the model as a whole does not break trs .",
    "so for each right(or left)-moving spin @xmath94 mode there is a left(or right)-moving spin @xmath4 mode with equal energy .",
    "the full control of the dispersions and their dependence on direction and spin _ separately _ can be achieved by realizing spin - dependent exchange couplings at the edges .",
    "candidates for the realization of such terms in the hamilton operator are the proximity effect of a ferromagnet in hybrid structures or magnetic doping in the bulk of the system .",
    "in addition , we studied the effect of a rashba coupling .",
    "the fundamental paradigm of topological effects is that they are particularly robust against any kind of perturbation due topological protection .",
    "this motivated our third focus , namely the effect of disorder on the edge modes . for clarity",
    ", we performed this study for the spinless haldane model .",
    "indeed , the existence of gapless states at the edges is guaranteed by the argument of topological protection .",
    "but there is no guarantee for the preservation of a well - defined dispersion of the edge modes .",
    "thus , the transport properties are likely to be influenced significantly by disorder .",
    "we reconstructed the dispersion of the edge modes in disordered systems in comparison to the edge modes of the clean system .",
    "the chosen criterion is the transition probability between the edge state in the clean system and the one in the disordered system . in this way",
    ", one can link the eigen states in the disordered systems to certain momenta and re - define a dispersion .",
    "the approach works very well for edge states of which the energy is far away from the bulk continua .",
    "but if the energies approach the band edges the mapping becomes ambiguous and does not work anymore .",
    "thus , for stronger disorder only small parts of the original dispersions can be reconstructed .",
    "increasing the disorder even further eventually destroys the edge modes completely .",
    "in addition , we established an approximate formula for the reduction of the bulk gap due to disorder in the haldane model .",
    "furthermore , we clarified how the transition probability depends on the width and the length of the system under study .",
    "the width does not have a significant impact once the sample is wide enough so that the two edge modes do not interact anymore .",
    "the length leads to an exponential decrease of the transition probability .",
    "finally , we addressed the robustness of the edge states at decorated edges which allow us to design small and tunable fermi velocities . applying the reconstruction procedure we can cope with small disorder strengths .",
    "but we found our expectation confirmed that the flat regions of the dispersions are particularly susceptible to perturbations .",
    "we conclude that in order to realize and to apply the ideas of tunable group velocities one has to resort to clean samples .",
    "the edge modes displaying a large dispersion and staying away from the band edges of the bulk modes are those which are robust to disorder .",
    "further studies are called for in order to further investigate the influence of other kinds of disorder or imperfections . on the one hand",
    ", it is conceivable that spatially correlated disorder is less harmful to the edge modes than the completely local one we studied here .",
    "the edge modes may flow around smoother regions of disorder or imperfections , for an example on the surface of a topological insulatorsee see ref .  .",
