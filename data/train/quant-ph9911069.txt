    "in recent years there has been an increasing interest on trapping phenomena and related cooling techniques @xcite .",
    "a number of recent theoretical and experimental papers have investigated the ability to coherently control or ",
    "engineer \" atomic quantum states . experiments on trapped ions , where the zero point of motion was closely approached trough laser cooling @xcite , already showed the effects of nonclassical motion in the absorption spectrum @xcite .",
    "more recent experiments report the generation of fock , squeezed and schrdinger cat states @xcite .",
    "these states appear to be of fundamental physical interest and possibly of use for sensitive detection of small forces @xcite .",
    "moreover , the possibility to synthetize nonclassical motional states gave rise to new models in quantum computation @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a way to reach a stationary nonclassical motional state for a trapped particle @xcite , which is able to give a significant uncertainty contraction in one phase - space direction .",
    "the scheme can be then applied to control the vibrational motion against the heating processes responsible for decoherence @xcite .",
    "this could be important to obtain high fidelity in quantum logic operations @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the scheme is to realize an effective and continuous measurement of a vibrational quadrature for the trapped particle and then apply a feedback loop able to control , i.e. to reduce , its fluctuations even below the quantum limit .",
    "the fact that a feedback loop may reduce the fluctuations in one quadrature of an in - loop field without increasing the fluctuations in the other has been known for a long time , and has recently been called  squashing \" @xcite as opposed to  squeezing \" of a free field , in which the conjugate fluctuations are increased . in our scheme ,",
    "the obtained stationary state results as a  squashed \" state ; however , the quadrature measurement increases the noise in the orthogonal quadrature well above the standard quantum limit and the squashing comes with respect to the state one has in presence of the measurement process and without the feedback action . in this way the uncertainty principle is not violated .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we show how to realize the indirect continuous measurement of a vibrational quadrature by coupling the trapped particle with a standing wave . in section iii we shall introduce the feedback loop , in section iv we shall study the properties of the stationary state in the presence of feedback and section v is for concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a generic particle trapped in an effective harmonic potential . for simplicity we shall consider the one - dimensional case , even if the method can be in principle generalized to the three - dimensional case .",
    "this particle can be an ion trapped by a rf - trap @xcite or a neutral atom in an optical trap @xcite .",
    "our scheme however does not depend on the specific trapping method employed and therefore we shall always refer from now on to a generic trapped `` atom '' .    the trapped atom of mass @xmath0 , oscillating with frequency @xmath1 along the @xmath2 direction and with position operator @xmath3 , @xmath4 , is coupled to a standing wave in a cavity with frequency @xmath5 , wave - vector @xmath6 along @xmath2 and annihilation operator @xmath7 .",
    "the standing wave is quasi - resonant with the transition between two internal atomic levels @xmath8 separated by @xmath9 .",
    "we consider also an external driving of the standing wave with a laser at frequency @xmath10 and of the atomic center - of - mass motion with a classical electric field along the @xmath2 direction , with frequency @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian of the system is @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the coupling constant .    in the interaction representation with respect to @xmath16 , and making the rotating wave approximation ,",
    "that is , neglecting terms rapidly oscillating at the driving laser frequency @xmath10 , this hamiltonian becomes @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the atomic detuning .",
    "this detuning can be set to be much larger than all the other parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and in this case , the excited level can be adiabatically eliminated , so to get the following effective hamiltonian for the vibrational motion of the atom and the standing wave mode alone @xcite @xmath21    if we set the spatial phase @xmath22 , and assume the lamb - dicke regime , one can approximate @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ hdisp ] ) .",
    "then , in the interaction representation with respect to @xmath24 and making the rotating wave approximation , i.e. , neglecting all the terms oscillating at @xmath25 ( which is of the order of 1 mhz ) or faster because we are interested in the dynamics at much larger times , we finally get @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this hamiltonian gives rise to a crossed kerr - like effect which could be exploited to generate nonclassical states analogously to the all - optical case proposed in ref .",
    "a similar approach was used for schrdinger cat motional states of atoms in cavity qed @xcite . here , instead , we are looking for stationary nonclassical states .",
    "the evolution of the density matrix @xmath29 of the whole system ( vibrational degree of freedom plus the cavity mode ) is determined by the hamiltonian ( [ h2b ] ) and by the terms describing the photon leakage out of the cavity with decay rate @xmath30 and the coupling of the vibrational motion with the thermal environment @xmath31 , that is @xmath32   + \\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\left(2 b d b^{\\dag}-b^{\\dag } b d - d b^{\\dag } b\\right ) \\;.\\ ] ] for the determination of the damping term of the vibrational motion @xmath33 , we note that it occurs at a frequency @xmath34 of the order of mhz and that the corresponding damping rate @xmath35 is usually much smaller @xcite .",
    "it seems therefore reasonable to use the rotating wave approximation in the interaction between the atom center - of - mass and its reservoir , leading us to describe the damping of the vibrational degree of freedom in terms of the quantum optical master equation ( at nonzero temperature ) @xcite , @xmath36 where @xmath37^{-1}\\ , , $ ] is the number of thermal phonons ( @xmath38 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath39 the equilibrium temperature ) .",
    "an analogous treatment is considered in @xcite .",
    "we have to remark , however , that the damping and heating mechanisms of a trapped atom are not yet well understood @xcite and that different kinds of ion - reservoir interaction have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the quantum langevin equations @xcite corresponding to the master equation ( [ dtot ] ) reads @xmath40 where the input quantum noises @xmath41 and @xmath42 have zero mean and the following correlation functions @xmath43    when the external driving terms described by @xmath44 and @xmath45 are sufficiently large , the stationary state of the system is quasi - classical , that is , the standing wave is approximately in a coherent state with a large amplitude @xmath46 , and the atomic vibrational motion along @xmath2 is approximately in a coherent state with a large amplitude @xmath47 .",
    "the values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 are given by the solutions of the coupled nonlinear equations given by the semiclassical version of the quantum langevin equations eqs .",
    "( [ eqsba1 ] ) and ( [ eqsba2 ] ) : @xmath50 since @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the semiclassical condition for the steady state is satisfied when @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "we shall consider @xmath68 , i.e. , the atomic position quadrature , from now on , even if the following considerations can be easily extended to the case of generic phases .",

    "it is now reasonable to assume that the standing wave mode is highly damped , i.e. @xmath81 ( this does not conflict with the preceding assumptions , since the coupling constant @xmath82 ( displaced by an amount @xmath49 ) .",
    "this allows us to adiabatically eliminate the field and to perform a perturbative calculation in the small parameter @xmath83 , obtaining ( see also ref .",

    "the relationship between the conditioned mean values follows from eq .",

    "the double commutator with @xmath72 is typical of qnd measurements .",
    "we are now able to use the continuous record of the atom phonon quadrature to control its motion through the application of a feedback loop .",
    "we shall use the continous feedback theory proposed by wiseman and milburn @xcite .",
    "one has to take part of the stochastic output homodyne photocurrent @xmath92 , obtained from the continuous monitoring of the meter mode , and feed it back to the vibrational dynamics ( for example as a driving term ) in order to modify the evolution of the mode @xmath93 . to be more specific , the presence of feedback modifies the evolution of the conditioned state @xmath94 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the feedback effect can be described by an additional term in the master equation , linear in the photocurrent @xmath92 , i.e. @xcite @xmath95_{fb}=\\frac{i(t-\\tau)}{\\eta\\chi}\\ , { \\cal k}\\rho_c(t)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath96 is the time delay in the feedback loop and @xmath97 is a liouville superoperator describing the way in which the feedback signal acts on the system of interest .",
    "the feedback term ( [ rhofb ] ) has to be considered in the stratonovich sense , since eq .",
    "( [ rhofb ] ) is introduced as limit of a real process , then it should be transformed in the ito sense and added to the evolution equation ( [ rhoceq ] ) .",
    "a successive average over the white noise @xmath78 yields the master equation for the reduced density matrix @xmath98 in the presence of feedback . in the general case of a nonzero feedback delay time ,",
    "one gets a non - markovian master equation which is very difficult to solve @xcite ( see however ref .",
    "most often however , the feedback delay time is much shorter than the characteristic time of the @xmath93 mode , which in the present case is given by the energy relaxation time @xmath99 , and in this case the dynamics in the presence of feedback can be described by a markovian master equation @xcite , which is given by @xmath100\\right]+{\\cal k}\\left(ie^{i\\varphi } \\rho x-",

    "then , since the liouville superoperator @xmath97 can only be of hamiltonian form @xcite , we choose it as @xmath101/2 $ ] @xcite , which means feeding back the measured homodyne photocurrent to the vibrational oscillator with a driving term in the hamiltonian involving the quadrature orthogonal to the measured one ; @xmath102 is the feedback gain related to the practical way of realizing the loop .",
    "one could have chosen to feed the system with a generic phase - dependent quadrature , due to the homodyne current , however , it will turn out that the above choice gives the best and simplest result .",
    "since the measured quadrature of the vibrational mode is its position , the feedback will act as a driving for the momentum . using the above expressions in eq .",

    "( [ totale ] ) is very instructive because it clearly shows the effects of the feedback loop on the vibrational mode @xmath93 .",
    "the proposed feedback mechanism , indeed , not only introduces a parametric driving term proportional to @xmath105 , but it also simulates the presence of a squeezed bath , characterized by an effective damping constant @xmath106 and by the coefficients @xmath107 and @xmath108 , which are given in terms of the feedback parameters @xcite .",
    "an interesting aspect of the effective bath described by the first four terms in the right hand side of ( [ totale ] ) is that it is characterized by phase - sensitive fluctuations , depending upon the experimentally adjustable phase @xmath75 .",

    "this is a relevant result of the present feedback scheme since it is able to reduce not only the thermal fluctuations but even the quantum ones .",
    "the potentiality of this feedback mechanism is clearly shown in fig.1 , where @xmath121 goes well below zero for increasing values of @xmath124 .",
    "instead in fig.2 we have sketched the phase space uncertainty contours obtained by cutting the wigner function corresponding to eq.([charsol ] ) at @xmath125 times its maximum height .",
    "we see that the state resulting from the feedback action ( solid line ) has a relevant contraction in the @xmath126 direction , but the same uncertainty in the @xmath127 direction with respect to the state of the system undergoing measurement without feedback ( dashed line ) .",
    "we refer to this type of noise reduction produced by feedback loop as squashing , whereas squeezing refers to conventional quantum noise reduction @xcite .    summarizing , we have proposed a feedback scheme based on an indirect ( qnd ) measurement which is able not only to contain the heating of the vibrational motion of a trapped ion , but also to produce nonclassical motional states ( squashed ones ) . up to this point",
    "we have not discussed the specific way in which a particular feedback hamiltonian could be implemented . in our case , it is important to be able to realize a term in the feedback hamiltonian proportional to the quadrature orthogonal to @xmath72 .",

    "the model could be extended to the three dimensional case , one should only consider three orthogonal standing waves far from resonant transitions .    in conclusion",
