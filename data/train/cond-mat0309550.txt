    "the search for models to explain the dynamic behavior of nonequilibrium physical systems which present heterogeneous catalytic reactions are the aim of several works in statistical physics [ 1 - 9 ] .",
    "the well - known ziff , gulari and barshad model ( zgb model ) [ 10 ] , used to explain the kinetics of reactions like @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath3 @xmath6 [ 5,11]on a catalytic surface , shows some features that are not in agreement with the experiments .",
    "for example , this model presents , for the catalytic oxidation of @xmath0 , a continuous phase transition between an active and an o - poisoned states , which is not found experimentally .",
    "several experiments tell us that the production of @xmath4 molecules starts as soon as the @xmath0 molecules begin to reach the surface [ 12 ] .",
    "some attempts were made with the aim to clarify this point [ 2,5,6,9,12,13 ] .",
    "for instance , hua and ma [ 9 ] proposed a model where the sites on the catalytic surface are separated in two types : active and not active sites . in their model ,",
    "the surface reactions follow the langmuir - hinshelwood mechanism , although the adsorption of molecules depends on the kind of the chosen site , i.e. , if the site to do the adsorption is active or not active .",
    "they prepared the lattice surface with a fraction @xmath7 of distributed randomly active sites .",
    "after , they considered that the conditions for the adsorption of molecules on the surface are : ( a ) an @xmath1 molecule is adsorbed if at least one of the two vacant adjacent sites , randomly chosen , is an active site ; ( b ) a @xmath0 molecule is adsorbed with probability @xmath8 if the empty site , randomly chosen too , is an active site ; if the chosen site is not active , the adsorption of @xmath0 occurs with probability @xmath9 .",
    "they found the phase diagram of their model and showed that the phase transition from the reactive state to the @xmath0-poisoned one is a continuous transition for small values of @xmath7 , and it is a discontinuous phase transition when the value of @xmath7 is large .",
    "when they increase the value of @xmath9 , the reactive region is narrowed .",
    "besides , they showed that the @xmath10-poisoned phase does not appear for different values of @xmath7 .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a variation of the zgb model .",
    "we aimed to study the influence in the phase diagram of the hipothesis intoduced by ziff et al . that all sites at the catalytic surface are equally accessible to adsorption for both incident molecules ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) . in our model",
    ", the catalytic surface does not present a site distribution with equal probability for adsorption for both molecules : we proposed that the adsorption of a @xmath0 molecule only occurs if the chosen empty site has preference for the adsorption of this molecule , and analogous procedure is followed for the adsorption of @xmath1 molecule . for this , the lattice presents a fraction @xmath11 of sites that prefers adsorb @xmath0 molecules , a fraction @xmath12 of sites that prefers adsorb @xmath1 molecules , and a fraction @xmath13 of sites that accepts both molecules .",
    "this model can be understood as a catalytic surface with deffects , where the affinity to adsorption is site dependent .",
    "the model was studied by monte carlo simulations , and we determined the production rate of @xmath4 as a function of @xmath11 , @xmath12 and of the relative adsorption rate of co molecules , denoted by @xmath14 . in this problem , the significant parameter to tell us if the system is in a reactive state is the production rate of @xmath4 , @xmath15 , because a nonzero number of empty sites does not guarantee that the system is active - it is necessary to know what kind of molecule the vacant sites at the lattice are available to adsorption . a possible situation to be found",
    "is that where we have only one empty site in the lattice , and this site accepts only the adsorption of oxygen : once the @xmath1 molecule needs two vacant sites to be adsorbed , this site always will be empty . with the purpose to rich our model",
    ", we separate the sites in the lattice in three kinds : a fraction @xmath11 of sites that accepts only the adsorption of @xmath0 , a fraction @xmath12 of sites that accepts only the adsorption of oxygen , and a fraction @xmath13 of sites that accepts the adsorption of both molecules",
    ". the zgb model would be a particular case of our model , in which the fraction @xmath13 would be @xmath8 .",
    "we show that the present model predicts a phase diagram where an absorbing phase by oxygen atoms does not appear when @xmath16 and @xmath11 varies from @xmath17 to @xmath18 . in the next section we present the model , and in sec .",
    "iii we present the results obtained for the production rate of @xmath4 , the discussion of the results and conclusions .",
    "the simplest model to describe the surface catalytic reaction is that one presented by ziff , gulari and barshad [ 10 ] . in this model ,",
    "the catalytic surface is represented by a square lattice , and all sites are accessible to molecules of any kind . in this surface ,",
    "molecules of two species are adsorbed : @xmath0 and @xmath1 molecules .",
    "when a @xmath0 molecule is adsorbed , it occupies only one site in the lattice , while the @xmath1 molecule occupies two sites because it dissociates in two oxygen atoms when it is adsorbed .",
    "if the adsorbed @xmath0 has an @xmath10 atom as its nearest - neighbor , @xmath0 and @xmath10 react forming a @xmath4 molecule .",
    "this new molecule leaves immediately the surface , and two sites are set free in the lattice .",
    "the whole process follows the langmuir - hinshelwood mechanism and the following three steps are considered :    \\(1 ) @xmath19 ,    \\(2 ) @xmath20 ,    \\(3 ) @xmath21 , + where the labels @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote adsorbed and gaseous particles , respectively , and @xmath24 is a vacant site . the steps ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) describe the adsorption of the molecules co and @xmath25 , respectively , and the third step represents the proper reaction between the adsorbed species to form the @xmath26 molecule .",
    "in this model , the vacant sites are free to adsorb both molecules equally .",
    "when we take into account that the sites in the lattice are divided into three categories , those steps may be changed :    \\(1 ) @xmath27 ,    \\(2 ) @xmath28 ,    \\(3 ) @xmath29 , + where the labels @xmath0 and @xmath10 on @xmath30 indicates if the vacant site @xmath30 is a preferential site for a @xmath0 or @xmath1 adsorption , respectively .",
    "the label @xmath31 means no preferential adsorption site . to describe the whole process we need to consider also the relative adsorption rate of @xmath0 molecules , denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "the monte carlo simulation was performed on a square lattice of linear dimension @xmath33 . for a given value of @xmath33 , the lattice was prepared taking into account the fractions @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 of sites that accept the adsorption of the molecules .",
    "we have used in all of our simulations periodic boundary conditions . for each value of @xmath32",
    ", we choose what kind of molecule will be tried to adsorb .",
    "if the chosen molecule is @xmath0 , we choose randomly a site @xmath34 where @xmath0 can be adsorbed : if this site is empty and if it accepts to adsorb this molecule , i.e. , this is a vacant site of the type @xmath35 or @xmath36 , the adsorption is performed ; if @xmath34 is occupied , the trial ends .",
    "if the selected molecule is @xmath1 , we select randomly two nearest neighbor sites @xmath37 and @xmath38 : if both sites are empty and if they are of types @xmath39 or @xmath36 , the adsorption happens ; if one of them is occupied , or one of them is of @xmath35 type , the trial finishes .",
    "since the adsorption of @xmath0 occurs , its four nearest neighbors are analyzed : if one of them is an @xmath10 atom , a @xmath4 molecule is formed , and it leaves immediately the surface .",
    "when this happens , two vacant sites are free for a new adsorption .",
    "the same occurs when an @xmath1 molecule is adsorbed : in this case can be formed one or two @xmath4 molecules , with two or four sites being free in the lattice , respectively .",
    "one monte carlo step ( mcs ) equals @xmath40 adsorption trials .",
    "after one mcs , we compute the production number of @xmath4 . in order to estimate the quantity of interest",
    ", we discarded the first @xmath41 monte carlo steps to reach the stationary state , and we have used the next @xmath42 monte carlo steps to calculate the averages .    in our model , the significant parameter to determine if system is in a reactive or in a non reactive state is the @xmath4 yielding , @xmath15 ( in the zbg model",
    ", we can take the fraction of the vacant sites in the lattice ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 is used because , even having a nonzero fraction of vacant sites in the lattice , we can not guarantee the state is active : it is necessary to know for what kind of molecules the vacant sites are available to adsorption .",
    "for example , if in the lattice there is only one vacant site and it does not accept @xmath0 molecules for adsorption , the site will never be occupied .",
    "figure 1 shows some snapshots of a square lattice with @xmath43 , for @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , for the inicial configuration ( fig .",
    "1a ) , after 100 mcs ( fig .",
    "1b ) and after 1000 mcs ( fig .",
    "1.c ) : we can see that the system always presents a number of vacant sites ( @xmath35 , @xmath39 and @xmath36 ) different from zero .",
    "in the zgb model , the phase diagram shows two absorbing phases ( poisoned or inert ) and one active ( or reactive ) phase .",
    "the transition from the @xmath10-poisoned phase to the reactive one occurs for @xmath47 , and this is a continuous phase transition . if the value of @xmath32 increases , the system remains in a reactive phase up to @xmath48 , when it becomes @xmath0-poisoned .",
    "this second transition is a first - order one , where there is an abrupt change in the number of vacant sites for @xmath48 .",
    "however , when the lattice sites present different affinities for the adsorption of molecules , the phase diagram changes . if @xmath11 or @xmath12 are different from zero , the inert phases ( @xmath0 or @xmath10-poisoned phases ) disappear . in the sequence , we present some representative diagrams of the simulations , all the results for a square lattice with @xmath43 .",
    "figure 2 shows the results for the production rate of @xmath4 , @xmath15 , for @xmath49 and @xmath12 from @xmath17 to @xmath18 ( we remember that @xmath50 ) .",
    "we can see that @xmath15 decreases drastically when the value of @xmath12 increases , becoming almost zero when @xmath12 is close to @xmath18 .",
    "the figure shows that the maximum production of @xmath4 occurs at different values of @xmath32 , and its value decreases when @xmath32 increases ; also , when @xmath12 is increased , this maximum moves in the direction of increasing values of @xmath32 . in the case present , the @xmath0-poisoned phase does not occur .",
    "figure 3 exhibits the production rate of @xmath4 as a function of @xmath32 , for @xmath51 and @xmath11 assuming values from @xmath17 ( zgb model ) to @xmath18 .",
    "this is the most interesting case because it is related to disappearance of the non - physical @xmath10-poisoned phase , which is predicted by the zgb model . also , the character of the transition from the reactive phase to the @xmath0-poisoned one changes : the first - order phase transition becomes a continuous transition when the value of @xmath11 is larger than @xmath52 .",
    "contrary that observed in figure 2 , the maximum of @xmath15 assumes increasing values when @xmath32 also increases .",
    "an intermediate case is that shown in figure 4 : it displays @xmath15 as a function of @xmath32 , for @xmath53 and @xmath11 assuming values in the range @xmath54 to @xmath55 .",
    "we can see , in this case , that the system does not present any inert regions , and the maximum production of @xmath4 is almost constant , only changing the value of @xmath32 , for which the maximum occurs .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that with a slight modification of the zgb model , which includes a non equal probability of adsorption of the species , it is possible to account for the experimental result concerning the absence of @xmath10-poisoned states in the oxidation of @xmath0 .",
    "we have found the production rate of @xmath4 as a function of the relative adsorption rate of @xmath0 molecules for several conditions of the catalytic surface : the probability of adsorption is site dependent and this fact leads to changes in the phase diagram .",
    "the most interesting case occurs when there is no lattice site with affinity only to @xmath1 : the non - physical @xmath1 poisoned state , predicted by the zgb model , disappears in the present model .",
    "we stress that the model can be understood taking into account deffects that modify the chemical properties of the lattice sites .",
