    "* frw3 : * the field equations of frw are the einstein equations , the balance of energy and momentum , and equations of continuity .",
    "these equations determine the fields @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath12 is the scale factor , @xmath19 the total pressure and @xmath18 the total energy density of the considered system .",
    "they depend only on time @xmath16 .",
    "the functions @xmath19 and @xmath18 are related to the thermodynamic state of the considered system by constitutive equations .",
    "the einstein equations , including a cosmological constant @xmath20 , can be brought into the following form :    @xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23    the balance of energy and momentum reads :    @xmath24    the equations of continuity are not written down here because they depend specifically on the considered material system .",
    "( as is generally known , the equations ( [ 3 ] ) to ( [ 6 ] ) are not independent . )",
    "* 1.2 : * a short inspection of frw 1 to 3 shows that with respect to geometry , frw is almost fixed .",
    "the only variable term is the scale factor @xmath12 in the metric @xmath10 .",
    "it is an unknown function of time @xmath16 .",
    "the enormous applicability of frw is due to the thermodynamic side of the theory .",
    "it has its origin in the constitutive equations for @xmath19 and @xmath18 .",
    "these equations , together with the cosmological constant @xmath20 which has to be regarded as a constitutive element of frw , define the various models of the theory .",
    "the literature about frw is `` almost infinite '' .",
    "therefore i confine myself to the citing of the basic papers by friedmann , robertson and walker @xcite and to some monographs from which i derived special advantage @xcite .",
    "many others could be cited as well .",
    "* 1.3 : * in what follows , attention is mainly focused on that class of models of frw which exhibit the phenomenon called big bang .    with respect to the scale factor @xmath12",

    "( for the motivation of b1 to b4 cf .",
    "e.g. the cited literature . )    in order to have a simple and convenient notation i use in the following the term frw in a somewhat restricted sense : it is characterised by frw1 to frw3 together with the conditions b1 to b4 .",
    "this means that in this paper we are ( almost ) always concerned within the frame of frw1 to 3 with cosmological models exhibiting big bang . only in section 2.6",
    "some remarks are added about other models which are connected to an extension of frw .    *",
    "1.4 : * it is well known that big bang is not an event in the sense of general relativity , i.e. there is no point @xmath25 which corresponds to a natural phenomenon we call big bang .",

    "is theoreticly understood to be a singularity there is a problem to what extend it can be regularized . by these remarks",
    "the problem we are dealing with in this paper is briefly outlined .",
    "* 2.1 : * in a first step of extending frw , a proposition is formulated and proved which is the key toward efrw . for this purpose",
    "we need some    * notation : * 1 .",
    "let @xmath12 be the scale factor of frw which is defined on @xmath260 , t[$ ] .",

    "* proposition : * let @xmath38 be a solution of the equations ( [ 3 ] ) to ( [ 6 ] ) . then both + @xmath39 and @xmath40 are solutions of the equations    @xmath41    @xmath42    @xmath43    @xmath44    for all @xmath32 . the equations ( [ 9 ] ) to ( [ 12 ] ) have the same interdependences as ( [ 3 ] ) to ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "* proof : * since for @xmath13 the relations @xmath45 and @xmath46 hold , the equations ( [ 9 ] ) to ( [ 12 ] ) are identical with ( [ 3 ] ) to ( [ 6 ] ) .",

    "more specifically , we are interested in the behaviour of @xmath56 in a neighbourhood of @xmath57 . from the definition of @xmath56 we arrive at the following two    * consequences : * 1 . since by assumption only such models of frw are taken into account for which @xmath58 we find that for each @xmath56 the relation    @xmath59    holds for arbitrary limits . hence , if we define @xmath60 , the function @xmath56 has the domain @xmath61-t , t [ $ ] and is continuous .",

    "the phenomenon of a big bang in frw is replaced by a big crunch bang in efrw .",
    "this means , if ( [ 17 ] ) is valid , the function @xmath56 is continuously differentiable in the whole domain @xmath66 of @xmath56 .",
    "however , as we shall see , condition ( [ 17 ] ) is not fullfilled by realistic constitutive equations for @xmath30 .    * 2.3 : * the question how the thermodynamic quantities @xmath29 and @xmath30 behave for @xmath67 can only be answered if some assumptions about the constitution of the universe for @xmath67 are imposed .",
    "the generally accepted supposition is the following :    the universe is radiation dominated in a neighbourhood of @xmath53 in the sense that the influence of ponderable matter is asymptotically negligible if @xmath67 . in other words , the model of a radiation dominated universe gives an asymptotically correct description of the real situation in the vicinity of @xmath57    this assumption has the following    * consequences : * 1 .",

    "these properties of efrw are very satisfactory .",
    "but , the question remains if the lorentz manifold @xmath389 is singularity - free in the sense of hawking , ellis et al @xcite or not .",
    "i think it is not !",
    "the reason is that the concept of a singularity ( in this strong sense ) depends on the use of affine ( or generalized affine ) parameters , and this has the consequence that proper time comes into play .",
    "thus we are confronted with the same situation as in frw .",
    "but , as we will see in section 4.2 , proper time loses its physical meaning in the vicinity of big crunch bang , because standard clocks indicating proper time are not constructible ( cf.@xcite ) .",
    "hence the analysis of a singularity of @xmath389 in the strong sense reveals only a mathematical property of efrw which is not physically relevant because it does not affect the physical properties of matter and lightlike signals .",
    "it is nothing but attributing the term singular to a certain hyperplane .",
    "this guarantees the physical applicability of efrw .",
    "the situation is similar to that described in section 4.1.5 .",
    "the choice of unsuitable quantities can produce singularities in a wide sense . in the present case proper time",
    "is not suitable .      in section 2.4",
    "we have seen that there are mathematical reasons to work with a new cosmic time scale @xmath120 instead of the time scale @xmath16 which is the proper time of the particles of ponderable matter . in this section",
    "i will complement the considerations of 2.4 by a physical argument in favour of @xmath120 .",
    "proper time was first introduced as a mathematical term . later on the problem",
    "was studied whether it is possible to define proper time as that time which is indicated by a special class of clocks , the so - called standard clocks , which are constructible ( in principle ! ) solely by geometrical means .",
    "such clocks exist ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "they indicate the proper time of a particle which shows up in the construction of a standard clock .",
    "then by experience we know that the time scales of standard clocks and of atomic clocks coincide at the present era of earth .",
    "the latter clocks are only constructible with the help of quantum mechanical means .    within dense matter",
    "as in the universe near big crunch bang the geometric construction principles of standard clocks lose their reference to reality completely , because the freely falling test particles needed for their construction do not exist ( cf .",
    "proper , i.e. standard time then is nothing but a theoretical concept .",
    "this is a strong hint that it should be replaced by another time scale .",
    "this was done in section 2.4 by introducing the new cosmic time scale @xmath120 .",
    "but , up to now it is an open problem whether there are constructive principles based on quantum theory for the clocks indicating time @xmath120 .",
    "nevertheless , it should be mentioned again that outside a neighbourhood of @xmath121 the proper time scale @xmath390 is appropriate , at least for practical purposes .      at a first glance ,",
    "the property @xmath391 for @xmath392 could look strange .",
    "but one should be aware that even in frw the supposition @xmath393 for @xmath75 is nothing but a comfortable convention .",
    "one could also work with the convention @xmath394 for @xmath75 .",
    "also in efrw there does not occur anything special .",
    "the reason is that many physical quantities , e.g. curvature and metric , depend only on @xmath395 or @xmath396 .",
    "other quantities , e.g. the hubble parameter , have to be redefined properly .        a model of efrw does not have horizons exactly if it is either periodic or aperiodic with @xmath72 .",
    "then , in the latter case necessarily @xmath255",
    ". moreover , if @xmath255 periodicity occurs if and only if @xmath397 .        in order to discuss the consequences of the above result with respect to the horizon problem",
    "let us first give a short characterization of it .",
    "+ if a relativistic theory , denoted @xmath398 , has symmetries , e.g. homogeneity and isotropy , two questions arise .",
    "+ 1 . are there horizons in @xmath399",
    "? + 2 . if there are horizons in @xmath399 , why is it that the manifold @xmath146 of @xmath399 exhibits symmetries , i.e. why have causally separeted regions of @xmath146 the same or very similar properties ?",
    "+ these two questions constitute what is called horizon problem in the present context . since in efrw plus ac the answer to the first question is `` no '' , so that the second question is empty , the horizon problem has been solved .",
    "but one should be aware that there is a problem behind the horizon problem which has not vanished with vanishing horizons . for",
    ", the nonexistence of horizons only guarantees causal contact for each particle with all other particles in the world . intuitively , this is a necessary condition for the large scale homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "but is it also sufficient ?",
    "hence , the horizon problem has a successor , the problem of large scale stability of universes with full causal contact of all particles .",
    "as far as i can see this problem is unsolved .",
    "however , calling it also `` horizon problem '' is abuse of language .",
    "this is because the term `` horizon problem '' has become an attribute of elements of the null set .",
    "looking back at efrw as it is presented in section 2.5 one may notice that the theory contains unspecified elements , the constitutive quantities @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the cosmological constant @xmath20 . only occasionally some specifications were introduced .",
    "it was assumed in chapter 3 that the universe near big crunch bang is asymptotically radiation dominated and that it is asymptotically matter dominated and @xmath400 ( i.e. matter is dust ) for sufficiently large @xmath401 .",
    "moreover , in section 4.4 the condition ac was introduced which amounts roughly to @xmath402 .",
    "this was done on purpose !",
    "it was not intended to study specified cosmological scenarios , rather to formulate a frame theory for possible scenarios .    in this way",
    "efrw is open to various combinations , especially all such scenarios which are used in frw , like inflation , variable speed of light etc .",

    "<S> starting from the classic friedmann - robertson - walker theory with big bang it is shown that the solutions of the field equations can be extended to negative times . choosing a new cosmic time scale instead of proper time one achieves complete differentiability of the scale factor and of suitable thermodynamic quantities equivalent to pressure and energy density . </S>",
    "<S> then , the singularity of big bang manifests itself only by the vanishing of the scale factor at time zero . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , all solutions of the field equations are defined for all times from @xmath0 to @xmath1 . in a separate chapter the horizon structure of the extended theory </S>",
    "<S> is studied . </S>",
    "<S> some weak assumptions guarantee that there are no horizons . hence </S>",
    "<S> , the horizon problem in a strict sence disappears . </S>",
    "<S> an intensive discussion of the results is given at the end of the paper . </S>"
