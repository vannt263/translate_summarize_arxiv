    "it is widely believed that gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and their afterglows are caused by the dissipation of kinetic energy of an ultrarelativistic ejecta , with lorentz factor @xmath3 , releasing from the central engine ( so - called  fireball \" model , see piran 1999 and van paradijs , kouveliotou & wijers 2000 for detailed reviews ) .",
    "grbs are the most energetic explosive phenomena in astronomy . in the fireball model , the collisions among different shells within the ejecta might be expected to produce a prompt burst ( paczyski & xu 1994 ; rees & mszros 1994 ) , and subsequently the ejecta interacts with its surrounding medium , producing a long - term and broad - band afterglow ( paczyski & rhoads 1993 ; mszros & rees 1997 ) . in the standard afterglow picture ,",
    "the ejecta drives a relativistic blast wave expanding into the surrounding medium , which approaches a self - similar solution ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) after a short time once the swept - up medium attains an energy comparable to the initial energy of the burst .",
    "electrons in the cold medium are heated in the shock front to highly relativistic energy and produce a broad - band afterglow via synchrotron / inverse - compton emission . the predicted emission spectrum and light curve ( mszros & rees 1997 ; sari et al .",
    "1998 ) have met essential successes in describing the behavior of afterglows ( e.g. , vietri 1997 ; waxman 1997ab ; wijers et al .",
    "the recent observations on grb afterglows have lead to numerous numerical calculations to model the observed afterglows ( e.g. , huang et al .",
    "2000a , b ; gou et al .",
    "2001 ; panaitescu & kumar 2001 ; panaitescu 2001 ) .",
    "we re - investigate the dynamical evolution and temporal emission of afterglows by considering three aspects .",
    "( i ) the electrons heated by the shock are always fast cooling when the cooling timescale for these electrons is shorter than the dynamical timescale ( see , e.g. , waxman 1997a ; mszros et al . 1997",
    "; sari et al . 1998 ) , and the afterglow evolution should be in the radiative regime rather than the adiabatic one as long as a significant fraction ( @xmath4 ) of the fireball energy is transferred to newly heated electrons , @xmath5 . this shock decelerates faster than an adiabatic shock , as pointed out by bttcher & dermer ( 2000 ) .",
    "the newly launched hete-2 satellite , due to its rapid and accurate location of grbs , should lead to much more follow - up observations on early x - ray and optical emission , allowing a detailed analysis of the afterglow feature .",
    "( ii ) the inverse - compton emission is important in afterglows ( panaitescu & mszros 1998 ; wei & lu 1998 ; totani 1998 ; chiang & dermer 1999 ; dermer , bttcher & chiang 2000 ; panaitescu & kumar 2000 ; sari & esin 2001 ; zhang & mszros 2001 ) .",
    "when the inverse - compton cooling of electrons dominates the synchrotron cooling , the temporal synchrotron emission is influenced by changing the scaling law of the cooling frequency @xmath1 ( defined later ) with time .",
    "( iii ) jets are especially important in grbs since they are relevant to almost all aspects of grb phenomenon , e.g. the total energy released in a grb , the burst rate , the ejection mechanism of the central engine and the dynamical evolution of the ejecta .",
    "it is of particular interest that the light curves of afterglows might be changed when the jet enters a spreading phase , as pointed out by rhoads ( 1999 ) , sari et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and dai , huang & lu ( 2001 ) .",
    "the discovery of polarization in the afterglow of grb 990510 has shown evidence for a jet - like outflow ( covino et al .",
    "1999 ; wijers et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we consider grbs as jets .",
    "the jet evolves as spherical - like expansion before entering the spreading phase ( rhoads 1999 ; sari et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the heated electrons are always fast cooling at first .",
    "this radiative and spherical - like phase ends once either ( 1 ) the electrons become slow cooling or ( 2 ) the relativistic jet transits to the spreading phase .",
    "so a `` radiative break '' in the light curve may appear for the case where the jet transits to the spreading phase when the electrons are still fast cooling and the jet is in the radiative regime .",
    "this break is different from the widely discussed `` adiabatic break '' for the case where the transition occurs in the adiabatic regime in which the electrons have been slow cooling . in this work",
    "we derive the overall analytical evolution of synchrotron emission from a relativistic jet .",
    "we first introduce the dynamical evolution of a relativistic jet in section 2",
    ". then the temporal evolution of synchrotron emission from the jet is calculated in section 3 . in section 3.1",
    "we analyze the radiative regime when the jet evolution is spherical - like .",
    "section 3.2 discusses the adiabatic break in which the electrons become slow cooling before the jet evolves into the spreading phase while section 3.3 explores the radiative break in which the transition to the spreading phase occurs in the radiative regime .",
    "we give some discussions and conclusions in section 4 .",
    "let s consider a relativistic jet expanding into its surrounding medium with an initial half opening angle of @xmath6 , a laterally - spreading velocity of @xmath7 and a bulk lorentz factor of @xmath8 .",
    "though the shock is beamed , the jet evolution is spherical - like as long as @xmath9 . because the electrons accelerated by a shock are always fast cooling at first",
    ", the jet should be radiative if the energy density of the electrons is a significant fraction @xmath4 of the total energy density of the shocked medium .",
    "the jet hydrodynamics in this radiative regime will be different from the well known self - similar solution for adiabatic blast waves derived by blandford & mckee ( 1976 ) , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the shock radius .",
    "thus , the jet behaves as a radiative and spherical - like expansion at the initial stage .",
    "the jet evolution later is divided into two cases .",
    "( _ a _ ) in the case of an adiabatic break , the accelerated electrons become slow cooling before the jet evolves into a spreading phase , so the jet exhibits an adiabatic and spherical - like evolution as @xmath10 sequentially and finally a spreading phase of @xmath8 dropping exponentially with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "( _ b _ ) in the case of a radiative break , the jet transition into the spreading phase occurs in the radiative regime where the shocked electrons are still fast cooling , and therefore the jet evolves from the initial radiative spherical - like phase to the spreading phase directly , without the second phase of adiabatic and spherical - like evolution of case ( _ a _ ) .",
    "1 depicts these two cases of the dynamical evolutions of relativistic jets .",
    "since the evolution of an adiabatic spherical blast wave is well known , we introduce here only the dynamics of so - called `` semiradiative '' blast waves for the initial stage of radiative and spherical - like evolution and of the radiative jet for the final stage in the case of a radiative break .    recently , for semiradiative blast waves ,",
    "in which the energy radiated is considerable to affect the evolution of the blast waves , cohen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have also derived a self - similar solution under the assumption that a fixed fraction of the energy generated by the shock is radiated away .",
    "this assumption is applicable at early times , since the heated electrons are in the fast - cooling regime and a fixed fraction of the total energy that has been transferred to electrons is radiated away while the protons do not radiate their energy and remain hot .",
    "following cohen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the radius @xmath11 and the lorentz factor @xmath8 of a semiradiative blast wave are in relation of @xmath12 , and they evolve with the observer time as @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the initial coasting lorentz factor of the jet , @xmath17 is the deceleration radius where the energy in the shocked medium equals that in the original explosion , @xmath18 is the observer time at which the deceleration radius is reached , @xmath19 is a fraction of energy that is radiated away and should be understood as @xmath20 in the fast cooling regime , and @xmath21 parameterizes the proton number density @xmath22 of the surrounding medium with @xmath23 . for @xmath24 and @xmath19=(01 ) , @xmath25 varies from 3 to 12 and the lorentz factor of the blast wave evolves based on @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "it is the adiabatic solution case with @xmath28 . denoting the energy in the original explosion as @xmath29 , and the redshift of this explosion as @xmath30",
    ", we have @xmath31 @xmath32    in the fully radiative ( @xmath33 ) case , the scaling @xmath34 differs from the widely used blandford - mckee solution , @xmath35 ( see , e.g. , sari , piran & narayan 1998 , bttcher & dermer 2000 ) , which assumes a thin shell with a cooled interior and the kinetic energy of the shell can be written as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the shell mass .",
    "in fact , the quantities , such as velocity , density and energy density , should be a function of distance from the shock front .",
    "thus , we prefer to use the self - similar solution of cohen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) which assumes a shell with finite width within which the interior exerting a pressure onto the outer . here",
    "after we use the equations above to describe the evolution of blast waves in the following calculations .    for the dynamics of a relativistic jet , rhoads ( 1999 ) has derived an adiabatic solution , in which the jet evolution in the spreading phase is an exponential slowing down of @xmath8 with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "we can expect the jet slows down even faster if it is in the radiative regime and loses energy more quickly than an adiabatic jet does .",
    "thus , for a radiative jet , @xmath11 is practically a constant during the spreading phase .",
    "therefore , from @xmath38 , we have the same scaling relation of @xmath39 as that of an adiabatic jet .",
    "as shown later , the previous studies on jetted afterglows are only suitable for the adiabatic break case with weak compton - cooling effect . at first , we concentrate on deriving the spectra and light curves in the initial radiative and spherical - like stage , and then we discuss the light - curve change around the break time in both the adiabatic and radiative break cases with strong or weak compton - cooling effect .",
    "we only consider the emission from the accelerated electrons , neglecting the emission from the hot protons .",
    "the electron distribution is assumed to be a power - law of lorentz factor , @xmath40 , with the minimum random lorentz factor , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the usual hydrogen mass fraction of the surrounding medium .",
    "we assume that @xmath43 here after so that the total electron energy is dominated by electrons with @xmath44 [ recently dai & cheng ( 2001 ) have studied the case of @xmath45 .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field in the co - moving frame is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a fraction of the total internal energy densty that is carried by the magnetic field .",
    "we concentrate here on the radiative regime when the cooling timescale for electron with @xmath44 is shorter than the dynamical timescale , @xmath48 for @xmath49 . in this case",
    ", the distribution of electrons extends to a lower lorentz factor @xmath50 as a power - law @xmath51 for @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath54 , where @xmath50 is the lorentz factor of electrons that cool on the dynamical timescale @xmath55 , @xmath56 here we have considered the inverse - compton cooling of electrons by the compton parameter ( sari & esin 2000 ) @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a fraction of the electron energy that is radiated away .",
    "we should note that @xmath59 for fast cooling and @xmath60 for slow cooling .",
    "the simple model of synchrotron spectra of afterglows is a broken power - law with three break frequencies .",
    "one is the absorption frequency @xmath61 below which the synchrotron photons are self - absorbed by electrons .",
    "the other two are the characteristic synchrotron frequencies according to electrons with lorentz factor @xmath44 and @xmath50 , denoted @xmath62 and @xmath1 , respectively . following the improved treatment of synchrotron emission by wijers & galama ( 1999 )",
    ", we have @xmath63 @xmath64 where the dimensionless factor @xmath65 , for @xmath66 .",
    "the absorption frequency is defined to be the point where @xmath67 .",
    "note that in the co - moving frame of the shocked shell ( denoted with a prime ) , the absorption coefficient @xmath68 scales as @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 ( waxman 1997b ) , where @xmath73 is the index of the distribution of those electrons relevant to synchrotron self - absorption around @xmath74 .",
    "for the absorption coefficient at co - moving cooling frequency @xmath75 we should take @xmath76 and then ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) @xmath77 where @xmath78 ( coming from @xmath79 for @xmath80 ) , @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the gamma function .",
    "the optical depth at @xmath83 is then @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the co - moving width of the shocked shell , thus we can get the absorption frequency @xmath86 for @xmath87 in the radiative regime .",
    "we have neglected the case of @xmath88 since @xmath89 lasts for only few seconds in general parameter space .",
    "the peak flux in the synchrotron spectrum is @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a factor defined by wijers & galama ( 1999 ) , which is @xmath92 for @xmath66 here , @xmath93 is the luminosity distance , and @xmath94 is the number of electrons in the shocked shell and given by @xmath95    substituting @xmath8 and @xmath11 with aid of equations ( 1)-(3 ) , one obtains expressions of @xmath62 , @xmath1 , @xmath61 and @xmath96 ( shown in appendix ) , and their scaling relations with the observer s time are @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 given these three break frequency and peak flux , we can calculate the synchrotron spectrum and light curve .",
    "note that @xmath101 in the radiative regime . for",
    "a homogeneous medium , @xmath24 ( note that hereafter in this paper the discussions are all concerned about this homogeneous medium case ) , the fluxes in the four frequency ranges divided by three break frequencies evolve as @xmath102 the light curve decay indexes are relevant to @xmath103 , and shown in fig .",
    "2 . therefore , observations of early - time afterglows following a prompt burst can help to determine the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "we have neglected the effect of inverse - compton process on the shape of synchrotron spectrum , because the thomson optical depth of synchrotron photons is generally very small and only a negligibly small fraction of synchrotron photons is scattered .",
    "besides , the typical energy of inverse - compton emission , @xmath104 , usually far exceeds that of the synchrotron component which we are concerned about , since the accelerated electrons are always relativistic because @xmath105 for relativistic blast waves",
    ".    the end of this radiative and spherical - like stage is determined by the minimum of two time scales .",
    "one is the time @xmath106 when @xmath107 . after this time ,",
    "the accelerated electrons around @xmath108 become slow cooling so that the shock is practically not radiative any more and transits from the radiative to the adiabatic phase ( the transition is gradual due to the gradual change of @xmath19 from @xmath4 to 0 , since @xmath109 . thus , in this transition phase , the blast wave evolution will not be self - similar ) .",
    "another is the break time @xmath110 when @xmath111 and the jet enters the spreading phase . having the expressions of @xmath62 and @xmath1 we can derive @xmath106 ( a detailed expression given in appendix ) . with the aid of the evolution of @xmath8",
    ", we have the break time @xmath112 ( see a detail in appendix ) . here",
    "we have taken @xmath113 .",
    "3 shows two times , @xmath106 and @xmath110 , varying with @xmath4 .",
    "it is the adiabatic break case in the small @xmath4 end since @xmath114 , while the radiative break case tends to appear in the right end where @xmath115 .",
    "we first discuss the case of @xmath114 , which corresponds to fig .",
    "1a . when the time @xmath106 is reached , the jet enters an adiabatic and spherical - like stage which have been studied by many authors .",
    "the blast wave evolves as @xmath116 .",
    "we have the well - known scaling relations @xmath117 in some @xmath118 cases , i.e. a magnetic field extremely far below equipartition like the cases of grb 971214 ( wijers & galama 1999 ) and 990123 ( galama et al .",
    "1999 ) , the adiabatic blast wave will be strong compton cooling with @xmath119 .",
    "the evolution of the cooling frequency @xmath1 becomes somewhat complicated if the @xmath0 case is considered .",
    "we combine @xmath120 and @xmath121 for @xmath0 with @xmath122 to obtain the general scaling @xmath123 for an adiabatic and spherical - like jet , this becomes @xmath124 we can see that @xmath1 might increase or decrease with time , depending on whether @xmath125 or @xmath126 , respectively . note that @xmath127 is also a function of time due to decreasing @xmath58 .",
    "so if @xmath128 , then @xmath0 in the beginning fast cooling phase , and @xmath129 generally in the slow cooling phase .",
    "the slowing - down leads to @xmath130 for @xmath131 , or @xmath132 for @xmath133 until @xmath134 ( we assume @xmath135 here after , which is consistent with the observations which show that all afterglows appear to have the electron energy distribution of @xmath135 ) .",
    "thus there might be a transition from the strong compton cooling ( @xmath0 ) to the weak compton cooling ( @xmath136 ) phase , as pointed out by sari et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . however , if @xmath137 , then @xmath136 throughout .",
    "it is now easy to derive the light curves in four frequency ranges @xmath138 note that the transition of a jet from the radiative phase to the adiabatic phase at @xmath106 results in a flattening of the light curve in the energy range of @xmath139 , and even the light curve is more flattening in the case of @xmath0 than in the case of @xmath136 .",
    "a break time is reached when @xmath111 . in this adiabatic break case , eq .",
    "( 21 ) is invalid to calculate this break time since an adiabatic and spherical - like phase has appeared before the final spreading phase .",
    "we need to derive the break time again as follows . from the integral @xmath140 where @xmath141 , the break time is given by @xmath142 ( see a detail in appendix ) for @xmath143 or @xmath144 . this value is larger than that of eq .",
    "( 21 ) .",
    "having entered the spreading phase , the jet evolves as @xmath39 and the shock radius @xmath11 can be regarded as a constant .",
    "we rewrite the scalings of the break frequencies and the peak flux as @xmath145 it is a rather remarkable result that @xmath1 is actually increasing with time in the @xmath146 case .",
    "therefore the flux turns to evolve as @xmath147 note that if @xmath136 , the transition of a relativistic jet into the spreading phase results in a steepening of the light curve in @xmath148 , with decay index @xmath149 independent of whether @xmath139 or @xmath150 .",
    "but in the case of strong compton cooling , @xmath0 , something different happens : the transition yields the same steepening of the light curve into @xmath151 in @xmath152 , but due to the cooling frequency @xmath1 increasing in time , a flattening from @xmath153 to @xmath154 appears in @xmath139 .",
    "define the light curve index @xmath155 and the spectral index @xmath156 as @xmath157 .",
    "table 1 summarizes the relations between @xmath155 and @xmath156 above @xmath62 for different cases .",
    "4 presents the effect of strong compton cooling on the @xmath158 relation above @xmath1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ t : afterglow ]      finally , when @xmath107 , the electrons become slow cooling , the temporal scalings of the break frequencies and the fluxes are the same as those in the later spreading phase of an adiabatic jet in section 3.2.2 .",
    "so eq . ( 28 ) are valid here .",
    "but the @xmath106 calculated in section 3.2.2 is not valid here because the jet has been in the spreading phase rather than the spherical - like phase .",
    "this time becomes @xmath159 ( see a detail in appendix ) , where the subscript  jet \" denotes the quantities in time @xmath110 .",
    "we have analyzed the whole process of a relativistic jet expanding into a homogeneous environment , from the radiative to adiabatic regime and from the spherical - like to spreading phase .",
    "then we have found two different kinds of light - curve break for the jet effect .",
    "one is an adiabatic jet break which appears if the transition of the jet into the spreading phase happens in the adiabatic regime when the accelerated electrons are already slow cooling .",
    "this case is widely discussed already .",
    "another is a radiative jet break which corresponds to the jet spreading obviously in the radiative regime when the accelerated electrons are still fast cooling .",
    "this case leads to a weaker break in the light curve if @xmath160 .",
    "based on the dynamics , we have derived the light curves of synchrotron emission from jetted afterglows , and summarized our main results as follows .",
    "first , in the earliest radiative and spherical - like phase , the light curve decay index is steep and relevant to @xmath4 shown in eq .",
    "( 20 ) , e.g. , the flux at high energy @xmath148 decays as fast as @xmath161 for @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "thus , as pointed out by bttcher & dermer ( 2000 ) , the rapid detections of afterglows at early times will provide a way to determine the electron energy fraction @xmath4 of total energy density .",
    "second , if the compton cooling of electrons dominates the synchrotron cooling , the afterglows will exhibit quite different behaviors from the previous predictions . in the case of an adiabatic jet break , the sharp steepening of light curve in both @xmath150 and @xmath139",
    "is only expected for the case of @xmath164 , i.e. @xmath136 in the beginning . while for the case of @xmath165 , the jet begins with strong compton scattering ( @xmath0 ) , and it might dominate total cooling over the whole relativistic stage ( sari & esin 2000 ) . in this case , the light curve steepening in @xmath150 is accompanied with a flattening ( or even a climb ) in @xmath139 , due to the increasing cooling frequency @xmath1 for @xmath0 .    finally , in the case of a radiative jet break , the late - time change of the dynamical evolution due to jet effect is weaker than in the case of an adiabatic jet break , which results in a weaker light curve break . if @xmath160 , the change is practically smooth , yielding a smooth `` break '' .",
    "thus , this kind of jet will show a singly steep light curve without obvious steepening break in @xmath139 , even though the jet is highly collimated with a small @xmath6 .",
    "a few grb afterglows are observed to have an achromatic light curve break , e.g. , grb 990123 ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1999 ; castro - tirado et al .",
    "1999 ; fruchter et al .",

    "jets in grbs are usually proposed to account for these breaks .",
    "however , in view of our work , two cases of relativistic jets are ruled out to explain these breaks : ( i ) an adiabatic jet ( @xmath114 ) with strong compton cooling ( @xmath0 ) and the cooling frequency @xmath1 locating in the observed energy range ; ( ii ) a radiative jet ( @xmath115 ) with a significant fraction of the total energy occupied by electrons ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "it should be noted that all the discussions here are concerned about the relativistic stage .",
    "if a relativistic jet expands into a medium as dense as @xmath166 , such as a circumstellar cloud ( galama & wijers 2001 ) , the blast wave must enter the non - relativistic stage within a few days , leading to a steepening of the afterglow light curve ( dai & lu 1999 , 2000 ) .",

    "<S> we discuss the afterglow emission from a relativistic jet that is initially in the radiative regime in which the accelerated electrons are fast cooling . </S>",
    "<S> we note that such a `` semiradiative '' jet decelerates faster than an adiabatic jet does . </S>",
    "<S> we also take into account the effect of strong inverse - compton scattering on the cooling frequency in the synchrotron component and therefore on the light curve decay index . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there are two kinds of light - curve break for the jet effect . </S>",
    "<S> the first is an `` adiabatic break '' if the electrons become slow cooling before the jet enters a spreading phase , and the second is a `` radiative break '' which appears on the contrary case . </S>",
    "<S> we then show how a relativistic jet evolves dynamically and derive the overall temporal synchrotron emission in both cases , focusing on the change in light curve decay index around the break time . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in view of our results , we rule out two cases for relativistic jets to account for the observed light curve breaks in a few afterglows : ( i ) an adiabatic jet with strong compton cooling ( @xmath0 ) and with the cooling frequency @xmath1 locating in the observed energy range ; ( ii ) a radiative jet with a significant fraction of total energy occupied by electrons ( @xmath2 ) .    </S>",
