    "interest in the study of samarium containing compounds has increased recently , owing to the theoretical prediction of topologically nontrivial surface states in smb@xmath6 @xcite , the high - pressure golden phase of sms @xcite , and ambient smo @xcite .",
    "the speciality of samarium arises from the perpetual competition between its two stable valence states : nonmagnetic sm@xmath1 and a magnetic sm@xmath5 , which is stabilized in many solids by the formation of spatially homogenous non - integral intermediate valence sm@xmath7 .",
    "experimental examples of samarium containing intermediate valence compounds include the extensively studied smb@xmath6 @xcite ; high - pressure golden - phases of sms , smse and smte @xcite ; ambient smo @xcite ; smfe@xmath8al@xmath9 @xcite ; sm@xmath10c@xmath11 @xcite ; and elemental samarium metal itself @xcite .",
    "the intermediate valence state of samarium can be understood as an intra - atomic promotion of 4@xmath12 electrons to 5@xmath13 bands , going from sm@xmath1 ( 4@xmath145@xmath15 ) to sm@xmath5 ( 4@xmath165@xmath17 ) .",
    "combined with the effects of strong electronic correlations and strong spin - orbit coupling , various exotic ground states are realizable in samarium based materials .        in this work we select the smo and euo system and address the question of the valence of sm in single crystalline euo films",
    "our interest is motivated by the proposal @xcite that smo is a candidate material for having topologically protected surface states and that a thin film interface of smo with the ferromagnetic semiconductor euo may make an excellent contender towards realizing the quantum anomalous hall effect in strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "while the preparation of high quality single crystalline euo thin films is well established @xcite , no report exists to our knowledge about smo films .",
    "in fact , the synthesis of smo as bulk material requires high pressures @xcite , suggesting that the preparation of smo in thin film form may not be possible using standard thin film deposition techniques . as a start , we are therefore interested to make a system containing smo@xmath18 octahedral units by utilizing euo as the stabilizing host material , i.e. to prepare sm@xmath2eu@xmath3o , and study the local properties of the sm .",
    "both smo and euo crystallize in a face centered cubic ( @xmath0 ) lattice with comparable lattice constants of 4.9414   @xcite and 5.1435   @xcite , respectively . based on empirical estimates of the lattice constants for sm@xmath5o ( 4.917  ) and sm@xmath1o ( 5.15  ) , @xcite the samarium valency in bulk smo was determined to be 2.9 + , not inconsistent with x - ray absorption spectroscopy measurements @xcite .",
    "euo on the other hand consists of the integer valent and magnetic eu@xmath1 , and exhibits many spectacular properties including a nearly 100% spin polarized conduction band @xcite , a metal - to - insulator transition ( mit ) @xcite and a colossal magneto - resistance @xcite in the slightly eu - rich compound , as well as large magneto - optical effects @xcite .",
    "we utilize the well established eu distillation technique @xcite to grow high - quality single crystalline sm@xmath2eu@xmath3o thin films by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) under ultra high vacuum conditions .",
    "we expect that the larger euo lattice will allow the sm to be stabilized in the 2 + valence state or at least in an intermediate valence state closer to 2 + compared to bulk smo .",
    "thin films of sm@xmath2eu@xmath3o were grown in a mbe system with a base pressure of 1@xmath1910@xmath20 mbar .",
    "prior to growth , epi - polished yttria stabilized zirconia ( ysz ) substrates with a ( 001 ) surface ( provided by crystec gmbh ) were annealed for two hours at 600 @xmath21 in an oxygen atmosphere of 5@xmath1910@xmath22 mbar .",
    "high purity eu metal ( ames laboratory ) and sm metal ( hunan hmc metals c. , ltd . ) were co - evaporated from effusion cells ( luxel radak i ) .",
    "the sm was additionally purified by degassing at about 1000  in a mo ampulla before use .",
    "eu was evaporated using a flux rate of 8.0 @xmath23 0.2  / min at temperatures of about 570 .",
    "sm was evaporated at flux rates of 0.02 - 1.5  / min at temperatures between 450 - 520 .",
    "molecular oxygen was supplied via a high precision leak valve and set to a partial pressure of about 3.0@xmath1910@xmath24 mbar during film growth .",
    "the ysz substrates were heated to 400 @xmath21 during deposition .",
    "these growth parameters were calibrated to fulfill the eu distillation condition @xcite .",
    "the growth was monitored by reflection high energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) using a staib instruments ek-35-r system .",
    "the diffraction patterns were recorded at an electron energy of 15 kv .",
    "after 60 minutes , the growth was terminated by first closing the oxygen supply and the sm shutter at the same time . to avoid a formation of eu@xmath5 at the film surface , after further 30 seconds the eu shutter was closed and the substrate cooled down to room temperature .",
    "two reference films were additionally prepared : i ) intermediate valence metallic sm was deposited at room temperature onto an annealed ysz substrate , ii ) a trivalent sm@xmath25o@xmath26 film was grown at room temperature onto a sm film at a sm evaporation rate of 7.1  / min in an oxygen partial pressure of 1@xmath1910@xmath22 mbar .",

    "[ fig : vbcompo ] , we have simulated the spectrum of sm@xmath34eu@xmath35o by composing a spectrum consisting of 12% trivalent sm@xmath25o@xmath26 and 88% divalent euo .",
    "the spectral weight around 5 - 10 ev binding energy is reproduced quite well , implying the trivalent nature of the incorporated sm .",
    "+ the detection of possible sm@xmath1 4@xmath12 states in the valence band region is rather difficult due to the intense eu@xmath1 peak at 2 ev binding energy . for a clear detection of sm@xmath1 , therefore , the eu 3@xmath13 and sm 3@xmath13 core levels were measured .",
    "figure [ fig:3d ] exhibits the core level spectra with the integral background @xcite subtracted .",
    "the integrated intensity of the peaks has been used to determine the sm content of sm@xmath2eu@xmath3o films , see table [ tab : values ] .",
    "the resulting eu : sm ratios fit in general reasonably well with the calculated ratios deduced from the metal fluxes measured using a quartz crystal microbalance and assuming identical re - evaporation rates of eu and sm .",
    "we note that for the film with the lowest sm concentration of 2.4 % the sm 3@xmath13 peak intensity is only of the order of the background .",
    "therefore , this doping level was estimated solely based on the flux ratios .",
    "the shape of the sm 3@xmath13 core levels in sm@xmath2eu@xmath3o matches well with the ones of the sm@xmath25o@xmath26 reference confirming the predominantly trivalent state of sm in our films .",
    "we do not observe any indication for the presence of metallic sm or sm@xmath1 within the limits of the measurement resolution .",
    "+ in the next step , we investigate the influence of the sm on the magnetic properties of euo to verify that the sm@xmath5 ions are successfully integrated into the euo matrix as indicated by the structural analysis .",
    "the incorporation of trivalent dopants into the euo lattice is known to enhance the relatively low curie temperature ( @xmath36 ) of 69 k for the stoichiometric compound @xcite .",
    "examples include doping with trivalent rare earth ions like gd @xcite , la @xcite , lu @xcite , and nd @xcite or trivalent transition metals ions like y @xcite and sc @xcite . indeed ,",
    "also our sm@xmath2eu@xmath3o films show enhanced curie temperatures .",
    "the temperature dependent magnetization curves are presented in fig . [ fig : moft ] .",
    "the euo reference sample shows the typical brillouin like shape with a @xmath36 of 69 k. upon incorporation of sm , @xmath36 increases significantly with a maximum of 122 k. the shape of the magnetization curves deviate from a brillouin function ( except perhaps for the 5% film ) , indicating the presence of phase separation , i.e. , part of the film orders magnetically at 122 k and another part at 69 k or lower .",
    "the observed elevated curie temperature of the sm@xmath2eu@xmath3o films proves the effective integration of samarium as dopant into the euo lattice and as well as provides further evidence for the predominantly trivalent character of the incorporated sm . in the 1970s , a few studies about the substitution of eu@xmath1 by sm in euo polycrystalline samples ( sm : euo )",
    "were published in which a trivalent character of the built - in sm ions was reported @xcite , and a higher maximum curie temperature of 135  was found @xcite .",
    "the magnetization curves of the sm@xmath2eu@xmath3o films exhibit a striking similarity to gd - doped euo which has a slightly higher maximum t@xmath37 of 125 k @xcite .",
    "the 3 k lower t@xmath37 value of the sm - doped films may be explained by the slightly larger ionic radius of sm@xmath5 compared to gd@xmath5 , and thus a smaller compression of the lattice , consistent with our previous band structure calculations .",
    "@xcite +    eu@xmath3o films . ]",
    "having unambiguously established that samarium is trivalent in sm@xmath2eu@xmath3o , we now address the underlying microscopic reasoning for the observed behavior .",
    "given that the lattice constant for euo ( 5.1435  ) @xcite is larger than intermediate valence bulk smo ( 4.9414  ) @xcite , one would expect that there is enough room to stabilize the larger sm@xmath1 ions in sm@xmath2eu@xmath3o .",
    "the observed unexpected 3 + valency can be reasoned as follows . comparing the lattice constants of @xmath0-nio ( 4.17  ) @xcite and @xmath0-euo ( 5.1435  ) @xcite",
    ", one can infer that the larger lattice parameter of euo originates from the fact that the ionic radius of eu@xmath1 is larger than both the ni@xmath1 and the o@xmath4 and that it is the eu@xmath1 ions which determine the lattice constant .",
    "thus , the o@xmath4 ions have enough space to move or rattle in this lattice .",
    "this should also be the case for sm@xmath2eu@xmath3o , giving the possibility to gain energy by moving the o@xmath4 ions closer to the sm ions as to form sm@xmath5 having the shorter sm - o bonds .",
    "a similar observation was also made in la@xmath38sr@xmath39coo@xmath40 , @xcite in which both co@xmath1 and co@xmath5 ions are occupying similar lattice sites .",
    "it was found that the co@xmath5 ions are in the low spin state although the lattice space would be sufficient to stabilize the larger ionic radius - high spin co@xmath5 ions . @xcite",
    "we have prepared high quality single crystalline sm@xmath2eu@xmath3o thin films with sm concentrations up to 20%  by eu distillation assisted mbe to study the valence state of sm . despite the large lattice spacing in the euo rock salt crystal which",
    "is expected to support the divalent state of sm , xps and magnetization measurements reveal that the incorporated sm ions exhibit a predominantly trivalent character .",
    "the curie temperature of the sm - doped euo films can be enhanced up to 122 k confirming an effective transfer of charge from the sm to the unoccupied states of the eu ions .",
    "we infer that the large euo lattice allows the oxygen ions to move locally in the structure , forming shorter sm - o bonds and thereby stabilizing the sm@xmath5 valence .",
