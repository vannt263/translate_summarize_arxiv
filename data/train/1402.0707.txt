    "it is a well established fact that matter exists in different states .",
    "one of the most important goals of heavy - ion collision ( hic ) experiments is to study the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter by finding possible phase boundaries and establishing their properties . in particular , high energy hic experiments want to study the deconfined matter ( qgp ) and the transition between qgp and confined hadrons .",
    "the na61/shine experiment  @xcite is a fixed target experiment in the european organization for nuclear research ( cern ) at the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) .",
    "the study of energy and system size dependence of fluctuations of identified hadrons is one of the  goals of the na61/shine ion program .",
    "the aim of this program is to search for the critical point ( cp )  @xcite of strongly interacting matter as well as to uncover properties of the onset of deconfinement ( od )  @xcite .",
    "the predecessor of na61/shine , the na49 experiment  @xcite seems to observe fluctuations possibly related to the cp in collisions of medium size nuclei at the top energy of sps  @xcite .",
    "however , measured fluctuations are affected by numerous effects not related to cp or od like volume fluctuations and conservation laws .",
    "thus , this result will remain inconclusive until systematic data on energy and system size dependence will be available .",
    "these data are being recorded and analysed by na61/shine .",
    "addressed , multiplicity and chemical fluctuations of identified hadrons produced in strong and electromagnetic processes were measured in inelastic p+p interactions at @xmath0 , 8.7 , 12.3 , and 17.3 gev .",
    "particle identification is based on energy loss measurements in the relativistic rise region .",
    "fluctuations of charged pions ( @xmath1 ) , kaons ( @xmath2 ) and protons + antiprotons as well as of positively charged hadrons were studied via first and second ( pure and mixed ) moments of identified particle multiplicity distributions . for the completeness ,",
    "figure  [ n_all ] shows energy dependence of mean multiplicity of identified all charged and positively charged hadrons in the analysis acceptance .",
    "note that the mean multiplicities are not corrected for possible biases and should not be used for direct comparison with models .",

    "the energy dependence of mean multiplicity of identified charged ( _ left _ ) and positively charged ( _ right _ ) hadrons in p+p interactions in the acceptance used for the fluctuation analysis . ]",
    "second moments of identified hadron multiplicity distributions were obtained using the identity method  @xcite .",
    "presented results include the statistical uncertainty and a first estimate of systematic uncertainty ( still under studies are detector effects and influence of feed - down ) .     the energy dependence of the scaled variance in p+p interactions : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5  ( _ left _ ) , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8  ( _ right _ ) .",

    "the multiplicity fluctuations were addressed using the scaled variance measure , @xmath9 of the multiplicity distribution .",
    "it is defined as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the mean multiplicity and the second moment of the multiplicity distribution of particles of type @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the scaled variance is an intensive measure  @xcite , i.e. it is independent of the number of wounded nucleons in the wounded nucleon model  @xcite or volume in the grand canonical ensemble , but it depends on their fluctuations .",
    "the latter feature makes it difficult to compare results from p+p interactions with those from nucleus+nucleus collisions . for the poisson distribution @xmath14 .",
    "figure  [ omega_all ] ( _ left _ ) shows the scaled variance of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the scaled variance of all considered particle types increases with increasing energy .",
    "rich data on the charged particle multiplicity distribution in the full phase space obey the kno scaling  @xcite . from this",
    "scaling follows a linear increase of the scaled variance with the mean multiplicity of charged particles visible as an increase of @xmath5 with collision energy ( see the bottom left panel of fig .",
    "[ omega_all ] ) .",
    "the scaled variance of unidentified charged hadrons measured within the acceptance chosen for this analysis is shown in the same panel by purple diamonds .",
    "the increase with collision energy is weaker than that measured in the full phase space , but agreement between @xmath18 and @xmath5 as well as between @xmath19 and @xmath20 indicates that kno scaling may also apply to pion production.figure  [ omega_all ] ( _ right _ ) shows the energy dependence of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "the scaled variance of identified positively charged hadrons is smaller than the one measured for the sum of charges .",
    "moreover , in the case of positively charged hadrons , instead of an increase with the collision energy the scaled variance is approximately independent of energy.the suppressed ( @xmath211 ) values of @xmath3 and @xmath6 are probably due to the baryon number conservation  @xcite . in p+p interactions ,",
    "the net baryon number is two , thus , fluctuations of the sum of charges is dominated by protons  @xcite .",
    "values of @xmath4 equal to or above 1 are probably connected with the strangeness conservation , which leads to a correlation between the @xmath22 and @xmath23 productions .",
    "it is supported by the fact that @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "it should be underlined that the influence of a specific charge conservation on the scaled variance depends on the volume of the system , mean number and mass of charge carriers , and the fraction of measured particles and anti - particles .",
    "measured quantities are approximately reproduced by the epos  @xcite , urqmd  @xcite and hsd  @xcite models .",
