    "the redshift range of @xmath9 is the key epoch for revealing formation and evolution of disk galaxies .",
    "large surveys in the optical and near infrared ( nir ) wavelengths have revealed important observational evidence for the dependence of galaxy evolution on its stellar mass : 1 ) the bimodal distribution in color with the boundary mass of @xmath10 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , 2 ) galaxies with @xmath11 and @xmath12 consist of the later- and earlier - type galaxies , respectively ( e.g. , @xcite ) , 3 ) massive galaxies with @xmath13 acquired most of their stellar mass before @xmath14 while less massive galaxies with @xmath15 acquired most of their stellar mass after @xmath14 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , 4 ) for milky - way size galaxies , only galactic disks have evolved in @xmath9 and both bulges and disk have been formed by @xmath16 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . these indicate that the redshift range of @xmath9 is the growing period for disk galaxies in terms of stellar mass . in addition , local disk galaxies have evolved their galactic disks in this epoch .",
    "understanding of the stellar component of galaxies at @xmath9 has progressed but there is a very small number of studies on molecular gas of normal galaxies at the redshift range ( @xcite ) . the next most abundant molecule , carbon monoxide ( hereafter , co ) after h@xmath17 has been widely utilized to measure molecular gas mass since the h@xmath17 molecule does not radiate line emission in a cold environment such as molecular clouds whose typical temperature is a few tens kelvin .",
    "one of the reasons for the small number of co observations in @xmath9 is the limitation from the atmospheric window .",
    "the so - called 3-mm window restricted by o@xmath17 of atmosphere of the earth is opened around @xmath18 ghz , which constrains the redshift of @xmath19 in the case of observations in co(@xmath1 ) whose rest - frame frequency is 115.271 ghz .    the sample selection with far infrared ( fir )",
    "flux also prevents the number of co observations toward normal galaxies from increasing in @xmath9 . for the time - consuming co observations ,",
    "it is preferred to observe galaxies with the coordinate , spectroscopic redshift and expected intensity .",
    "although the catalogue of a large optical survey contains the data of coordinate and redshift of many galaxies ( e.g. , @xmath20 for sdss date release 9 , @xcite ) , the number drastically decreases if the candidates are crossmatched with fir catalogue .",
    "in addition , sample selection based on fir flux obviously biases to ir bright objects such as ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) whose ir luminosities are @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the majority of local ulirgs are reported as mergers with tidal features @xcite .",
    "therefore , to select normal galaxies , sample selection based on fir flux is not an optimal choice .",
    "we performed @xmath0co(@xmath1 ) ( hereafter , co ) observations toward normal galaxies at @xmath7 with the 45-m telescope at the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) to fill the observational gap in @xmath22 . for the sample selection ,",
    "we use optical data instead of fir data to increase the number of candidates and select normal galaxies rather than ir - bright galaxies .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : the observational information and data reductions are described in section [ sec : observations ] .",
    "the obtained co spectra and the relations between molecular gas fraction and optical indices are shown in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we investigate the relation between the star - formation history and gas fraction with model calculation in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finally , we summarize this work in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we adopt @xmath23 km s@xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "sample galaxies are selected using sdss dr9 @xcite , which contains the photometric or spectroscopic data of @xmath20 objects .",
    "the basic criteria for the sample selection are as follows : 1 ) @xmath27 dec .",
    "@xmath28 degree , 2 ) @xmath29 , 3 ) apparent size : petrosian radius @xmath30 arcsec , 4 ) nuclear activity : hii , 5 ) morphology : disk galaxy , 6 ) d@xmath31 .",
    "the declination range is determined so that the objects are observable with alma as well as with the 45-m telescope at nro for a further investigation of gas distribution and kinematics , which are important for understanding the detailed physical properties of gas component in galaxies .",
    "we put the criterion of apparent disk size to check the morphology of disk galaxy ( higher likelihood in fitting of galaxy light profile with exponential than de vaucouleurs , ) .",
    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are excluded from our samples using a set of nebular emission line diagrams ( baldwin , phillips & terlevich , `` bpt '' diagram , @xcite ) to reduce the contamination of light from agn and estimate star - formation rate ( sfr ) accurately .",
    "we did not use fir fluxes but d@xmath4 to select sample galaxies .",
    "d@xmath4 is a measure of the strength of 4000    break and is defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 in   @xcite .",
    "this value allows us to constrain the mean stellar age of a galaxy where lower d@xmath4 indicates younger stellar population and vice versa @xcite .",
    "if we consider single - burst populations , the 4000    break , which is characteristic of cooler stars with types later than about g0 , becomes dominant at older ages .",
    "this is due to the sudden onset of absorption features bluewards 4000    produced notably by ca ii h and k , fe i , mg i , and cn lines .",
    "@xcite showed that co - detected galaxies in the cold gass project @xcite have lower value of d@xmath4 ( @xmath34 ) .",

    "the line frequency was shifted to between 93.638 ghz and 104.749 ghz from the rest frequency of 115.271 ghz according to the redshifts of the sample galaxies .",
    "we used a new two - beam , two - polarization , sideband separating sis receiver , tz ( two - beam sideband - separating sis receiver for z - machine ) @xcite and sam45 ( spectral analysis machine for the 45-m telescope ) which is a copy of a part of the fx - type correlator for the atacama compact array ( aca ) . the image rejection ratios ( irrs ) of tz were measured at each observing frequency in every observation .",
    "the values of irrs were @xmath36 db at the center of the intermediate frequency ( if ) through the observations .",

    "telescope pointing was checked every 50 minutes through observing sio maser sources close to our target galaxies at 43 ghz .",
    "we used the data that were observed with pointing accuracy better than 5 arcsec .",
    "the main beam size , @xmath39 is @xmath40 arcsec around 100 ghz , which corresponds to @xmath41 kpc at the lowest redshift of sample galaxies ( @xmath42 ) , and to @xmath43 kpc at the highest ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "all data were calibrated by the standard chopper wheel method , and converted from antenna temperature @xmath45 scale into main - beam brightness temperature by @xmath46 .",
    "the main beam efficiencies , @xmath47 in the 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 seasons at the observing frequencies were @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "data reduction is performed using the newstar software , which was developed by nro based on the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) package .",
    "integration time of each galaxy is typically six hours summed up for the both polarizations , and the typical r.m.s .",

    "@xmath60 is the full line width within which the integrated intensity is calculated . in the case where the peak temperature of the emission line has a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) less than three , the upper limit of 3 @xmath56 was adopted as @xmath54 .",
    "co line luminosity , @xmath61 is calculated from the integrated intensity and beam solid angle @xmath62 ( @xmath39 in radians ) as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a luminosity distance .",

    "figure [ fig : spectra ] shows the obtained co spectra binned with a velocity resolution of @xmath52 km s@xmath24 .",
    "we successfully detect co emission from six galaxies with s / n ( peak temperature ) larger than four , and tentatively from two galaxies ( @xmath74 s / n @xmath75 ) while the remaining four galaxies do not show significant co emission ( s / n @xmath76 ) .",
    "this high detection rate ( 67 % ) indicates the effectiveness of the sample selection based on d@xmath4 . the fitting result with a gaussian",

    "@xmath78 , full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , molecular gas mass ( @xmath65 ) and molecular gas fraction ( @xmath6 , equation ( [ eq : fmol ] ) ) are presented in table [ tab : results ] .",
    "@xmath78 is calculated by summing the intensity within the velocity range colored in red in figure [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "fwhm in this table is estimated with a gaussian fitting .",
    "although the line profiles of the galactic co spectra are not well described by a gaussian as in figure [ fig : spectra ] , we here present the fwhm for reference , which are not used in the following analysis .        [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : hubblesequencepegase2 ]        in this section , we compare the observed d@xmath79 relationship and the evolutionary path in this parameter space predicted by a population synthesis code , pegase.2 ( @xcite , hereafter pegase ) .",
    "pegase allows us to calculate chemical and mass evolution ( both gas and stellar components ) of galaxies consistently .",
    "we calculated the evolution of nine different types of galaxy ( starburst : burst ; early - type galaxies : e , s0 ; spiral galaxies : sa , sb , sbc , sc , sd ; irregular galaxies : i m ) according to template evolutionary scenarios for them @xcite . in @xcite , the observed spectral energy distributions ( sed , from optical to nir ) of @xmath80 nearby galaxies were used to compute the template seds for eight different morphological types ( e , s0 , sa , sb , sbc , sc , sd , i m ) . sfrs for the eight types were assumed to be promotional to gas mass as @xmath81 .",
    "in addition , sfr of starburst galaxies was modeled to be instantaneous , i.e. , @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "exponential gas infall and galactic outflow are also considered .",
    "galactic outflow is modeled to blow out all the existing gas in a galaxy at the specified time .",
    "@xcite are adopted as the initial mass function ( imf ) . in this imf ,",
    "the slope in massive star range ( @xmath83 ) is @xmath84 that is steeper than salpeter imf ( @xmath85 , @xcite ) .",
    "the parameters used for the calculation are summarized in tables [ tab : hubblesequencepegase1 ] and [ tab : hubblesequencepegase2 ] .",
    "pegase does not calculate evolution of molecular gas but total gas .",
    "therefore we only use cold gass samples combined with available hi data @xcite , since our observed galaxies at @xmath7 do not have hi data .",
    "the total gas fraction is calculated as @xmath86    figure [ fig : d4000-hdeltafh2_diffimf]a shows the comparison between the observed d@xmath79 and the results of model calculations for each galaxy type . even though the dispersion of the relation is enlarged",
    ", there is the same trend in the d@xmath79 relation of cold gass samples , such as one found in figure [ fig : d4000_fh2 ] where galaxies with higher gas fraction have lower d@xmath4 .",
    "we can see that the template models reproduce the observed trend where gas - rich galaxies tend to have lower d@xmath4 in figure [ fig : d4000-hdeltafh2_diffimf]a .",
    "in addition , it is also reproduced that the later - type galaxies tend to be distributed in the upper left in this plot ( see figure [ fig : d4000_fmol_ohssfrc]c ) .",
    "this qualitative consistency roughly supports the different evolutional scenarios ( gas accretion and star - formation timescale ) for different types of galaxies proposed in previous study based on optical sed , where later - type galaxies tend to have longer star - formation timescale normalized by total baryonic mass , and longer infall timescale , i.e. , more recent gas accretion @xcite .",
    "however there is a significant and qualitative difference between the observations and the model predictions , especially in d@xmath4 . although the predicted gas fractions in spiral models ( sa @xmath87 sd ) is almost consistent with the observed values , d@xmath4 is too low compared to the observed values . in early - type galaxies ( etg ) models",
    ", d@xmath4 evolves to @xmath88 but is still lower than the observed values ( @xmath89 ) for etg in figure [ fig : d4000-hdeltafh2_diffimf]a .",
    "we also calculated galaxy evolution with the same parameters except for the imf . in the previous studies with pegase , rana & basu imf @xcite",
    "was used to investigate the other parameters of galaxy evolution , such as star formation law and gas infall timescale , which reproduce observed optical spectra of each type of galaxy @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig : d4000-hdeltafh2_diffimf]b and c show the evolutionary path on the d@xmath79 plane in cases of two more widely used imfs , salpeter imf @xcite and chabrier imf @xcite , respectively .",
    "although these two models also fail to reproduce the observed relation , there are slight but important differences among the three models .",
    "first , gas fractions of spiral models at @xmath90 gyr with chabrier imf are larger than those with salpeter and rana & basu imfs .",
    "in addition , d@xmath4 of etg models at @xmath90 gyr with chabrier imf are larger than those with salpeter and rana & basu imfs .",
    "these results show that shape of imf can change the d@xmath79 relation .",
    "we discuss how the choice of imf changes the evolution of the d@xmath79 relation in the following paragraphs .",
    "first of all , the difference in the shape of imf changes the return gas mass from massive stars when they die .",
    "compared to less massive stars , massive stars end their lives instantly from their births .",
    "therefore , the imf with a larger fraction of massive stars results in a larger gas fraction of galaxy at the time .",
    "the fraction of massive stars is larger in chabrier imf than salpeter and rana & basu imfs .",
    "this explains the difference seen in the gas fractions of spiral models at @xmath90 gyr among three models .",
    "chemical evolution is one of the important factors affecting d@xmath4 evolution .",
    "current galactic d@xmath4 is determined by the gas phase metallicity when the major portion of stars were formed , and by the elapsed time since the major star - formation event occurred .",
    "it is because 4000   feature of galactic sed is formed by the metal absorptions of old stellar populations .",
    "@xcite investigated the behavior of the 4000   index for a single star and for a single stellar population ( ssp ) as a function of age and metallicity .",
    "they explicitly showed that the strength of 4000   break becomes larger as the metallicity of star and ssp gets large .",
    "different d@xmath4 evolutions of galaxies according to metallicity were reported in @xcite where a higher metallicity results in larger d@xmath4 using population synthesis code of @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported a relation between d@xmath4 and h@xmath91 ew and showed that the observed relation is reproduced by the code of @xcite with a fixed metallicity of solar value through the evolution .",
    "therefore , it is important to enlarge the metallicity of gas from which the stars are formed to increase d@xmath4 of stars to the observed values .",
    "the difference in the shape of imf changes the chemical evolution .",
    "the gas released from the dead stars is metal enriched , thus the imf with a larger fraction of massive stars results in earlier evolution of metallicity .",
    "figure [ fig : templatez ] shows the evolutions of gas phase and stellar metallicities with different imfs .",
    "we can see that the model with chabrier imf has metal enriched at an earlier time . gas phase and stellar metallicities of etgs respectively become zero and almost constant ( but gradually decreased with time ) after the galactic wind blows out all the existing gas is likely to be due to a small amount of accretion of metal - zero gas . ] .",
    "thus , the etgs model using the imf with a larger fraction of massive stars results in larger d@xmath4 .",
    "higher metallicity of gas from which a major portion of stars is formed can increase d@xmath4 as described above .",
    "however , at the same time , @xmath92 must go zero at the early epoch to increase d@xmath4 in the existing condition . in the next subsection",
    ", we discuss the possible reasons for the difficulty in reproducing the observed d@xmath79 relation quantitatively with the models .      in this section , we discuss possible reasons for the difficulty in reproducing the observed d@xmath79 relation in both sides of the model calculation and observation .",
    "one of the possibilities is the star - formation model in which stars are formed as long as gas exists regardless of the properties of gas component . according to the studies on star formation of the local universe , sfr is more closely related with dense molecular gas rather than total gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "accreting gas is expected to be diffuse and with high temperature from cosmological simulation of galaxy evolution @xcite . however , there is no model on transition from diffuse and hot gas to dense and cold gas in pegase .",
    "once stars are newly formed , d@xmath4 decreases because the luminosity - weighted sed becomes dominated by young and massive stars taking into account the mass - luminosity relation of main - sequence stars as @xmath93 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to increase d@xmath4 ,",
    "it is necessary to form stars from metal - enriched gas and quench the star formation in the early time of the galaxy evolution .",
    "therefore it is difficult to reproduce the galaxies with larger d@xmath4 and non - zero gas fraction with the existing conditions in the model .",
    "morphological quenching ( mq ) is an important process that can quench star formation even with a gas component , but which is not implemented in pegase .",
    "@xcite showed that once the central bulge becomes massive enough to stabilize the galactic disk against local gravitational instability , star - formation quenching occurs .",
    "central concentration of etgs leads to large epicyclic frequency @xmath94 , which is linked to the depth of the gravitational potential , and results in large toomre s @xmath95 @xcite . as a result",
    ", the star formation in etgs is quenched without a removal of gas component .",
    "we showed the concentration parameters of the cold gass sample in figure [ fig : d4000_fmol_ohssfrc]c .",
    "we can see that galaxies distributed in the lower - right corner in figure [ fig : d4000_fmol_ohssfrc ] mainly consist of etgs .",
    "therefore , our result suggests that they have large d@xmath4 and non - zero gas fraction because mq may work in those systems .",
    "re - accretion of the enriched gas in halo is also an important process for galaxy evolution especially in terms of chemical evolution , which is not modeled in pegase .",
    "@xcite investigated the metal - enriched circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) of a massive galaxy at @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "they listed three sources of heavy elements in cgm in order of the fraction , 1 ) galactic wind from the main host , 2 ) `` satellite progenitors '' accreted by the main host before @xmath96 , 3 ) `` nearby dwarfs '' orbiting outside the virial radius . according to their result , the metallicity of accreting gas increases with time as a consequence of re - accretion of the metal - enriched gas in a `` halo fountain '' @xcite .",
    "re - accretion of the enriched gas is likely to promote chemical evolution and increase d@xmath4 of modeled spiral galaxies .",
    "in addition , since re - accretion is reported to be more promoted in more massive systems due to the deceleration by the interaction with dense halo gas @xcite , the larger discrepancy in d@xmath4 of more massive galaxies may be compensated .",
    "the results of pegase calculation is a galactic d@xmath79 relation since pegase assumes a galaxy as an one - zone system .",
    "however , the gas mass of galaxies used in this study is a total mass and d@xmath4 is calculated using data obtained within the sdss 3-arcsec fiber . therefore it is not clear whether the obtained d@xmath79 relation is a relation between galactic star formation history and galactic gas fraction or star - formation history of central bulge and galactic gas fraction .",
    "therefore , the much larger d@xmath4 obtained with the observation than those in model prediction may be partly attributed to this situation , since most galaxies have metallicity gradients ( e.g. , @xcite ) . considering that most disk galaxies have exponential profile of molecular gas distribution and most etgs have molecular gas distribution with a relatively small extent ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the contribution of co emission from central part to the total co flux is large in both cases .",
    "thus it may be a relation indicating the evolution of central bulge . to understand the physical background of this relation ,",
    "it is important to compare spatially disaggregated d@xmath4 and gas fraction .    the universality of this relation should be investigated with higher-@xmath73 galaxies .",
    "recent co observations towards galaxies at @xmath98 revealed extremely high molecular gas fractions ( @xmath99 % ) in those systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the measurement of d@xmath4 of those systems allows us to enlarge the @xmath6 as well as the redshift ranges at the same time .",
    "although the reported d@xmath8 relation in this study has already given the important suggestion , once the observational assessments for the tasks described above are completed , this relation would be one of the strict observational constraints on the models for galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "we observed 12 normal galaxies at @xmath7 with the 45-m telescope at nro to measure the molecular gas mass and investigate the relation between star formation history and molecular gas fraction @xmath6 .",
    "the sample galaxies are selected with d@xmath4 instead of the widely used fir flux .",
    "the main results obtained in this paper are as follows :    1 .",
    "we detect the co emissions from six galaxies with s / n@xmath30 , two galaxies with @xmath100s / n@xmath75 out of 12 samples and show the validity of the sample selection based on d@xmath4 .",
    "using the literature data of nearby galaxies @xcite , we find a tight anti - correlation between d@xmath4 and @xmath6 indicating that more gas - rich galaxies tend to have younger stellar populations than gas - poor galaxies for the first time .",
    "we show that our sample galaxies at @xmath7 follow the same d@xmath4 relation of the nearby galaxies .",
    "this suggests that galaxies might evolve along this relation and that d@xmath4 might be used as proxy for @xmath6 which requires much telescope time to be measured .",
    "we calculate the galaxy evolution with a population synthesis code pegase @xcite to investigate the observed d@xmath79 relation .",
    "we calculate the total gas fraction @xmath92 with literature data of nearby galaxies and compare with the model calculations . as a result ,",
    "any template scenarios for different morphological types , which have been constructed so as to reproduce optical sed , can not reproduce the observed relation .",
    "our results suggest that star formation from metal enriched gas and star formation quenching in the early time are necessary to form galaxies with the observed large d@xmath4 and non - zero gas fraction .",

    "<S> we performed @xmath0co(@xmath1 ) ( hereafter , co ) observations towards 12 normal star - forming galaxies with stellar mass of @xmath2 at @xmath3 with the 45-m telescope at the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) . </S>",
    "<S> the samples are selected with d@xmath4 that is a strength of the @xmath5    break , instead of commonly used far - infrared ( fir ) flux . </S>",
    "<S> we successfully detect the co emissions from eight galaxies with signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) larger than three , demonstrating the effectiveness of the d@xmath4-based sample selection . for the first time </S>",
    "<S> , we find a tight anti - correlation between d@xmath4 and molecular gas fraction ( @xmath6 ) using literature data of nearby galaxies in which the galaxies with more fuel for star formation have younger stellar populations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that our co - detected galaxies at @xmath7 also follow the same relation of nearby galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the galaxies evolve along this d@xmath8 relation , and that d@xmath4 seems to be used as a proxy for @xmath6 which requires many time - consuming observations . </S>",
    "<S> based on the comparison with the model calculation with a population synthesis code , we find that star formation from metal enriched gas and its quenching in the early time are necessary to reproduce galaxies with large d@xmath4 and non - zero gas fraction . </S>"
