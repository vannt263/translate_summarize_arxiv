    "over the last decade , we have seen an enormous growth of interest and a related diversification of the physics of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite .",
    "a significant aspect of this ever - expanding interest is the intense study of macroscopic nonlinear excitations , such as solitons and vortices , which can arise in becs  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the emergence of such macroscopic coherent structures in the many - body state of the system establishes a close connection between becs and other branches of physics , such as e.g. , optics and the physics of nonlinear waves . within this interface of atomic and nonlinear wave physics , in recent years",
    "there has been an increasing focus on the study of multi - component becs  @xcite , and particularly _ spinor condensates _  @xcite .",
    "the latter have been realized with the help of far - off - resonant optical techniques for trapping ultracold atomic gases  @xcite which , in turn , allowed the spin degree of freedom to be explored ( previously frozen in magnetic traps ) .",
    "this relatively recent development has given rise to a wealth of multi - component phenomena , including the formation of spin domains  @xcite and spin textures  @xcite , spin - mixing dynamics  @xcite , dynamic fragmentation  @xcite , and the dynamics of quantum phases  @xcite .",
    "at the same time , macroscopic nonlinear structures that may arise in spinor becs have also been investigated .",
    "such structures include bright  @xcite , dark  @xcite , and gap solitons  @xcite , as well as more elaborate complexes , such as bright - dark solitons  @xcite and domain - walls  @xcite .    a relevant direction that has been of particular interest concerns the study of the breakdown of superfluidity and the concomitant generation of excitations in becs .",
    "in particular , much experimental and theoretical effort has been devoted to the understanding of important relevant concepts , such as the critical velocity introduced by landau , sound waves and the speed of sound , and the emergence of vortices and solitons  @xcite . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation has been used to study the flow of a bec around an obstacle or , equivalently , the effect of dragging a localized potential ( such as a blue - detuned laser beam ) through a bec . in this context , it has been predicted theoretically  @xcite and recently observed experimentally  @xcite that when the speed of the `` localized defect '' exceeds a critical speed , then dark solitons are formed in quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) condensates . on the other hand , in higher - dimensional [ e.g. , quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) ] settings , theoretical studies  @xcite have shown that a similar procedure leads to the formation of vortices ( or more precisely to vortex - antivortex pairs , due to the conservation of total topological charge ) .",
    "importantly , experimental consequences of this procedure , such as an onset of heating and dissipation were monitored experimentally  @xcite .",
    "other relevant theoretical works include studies of the breakdown of superfluidity , the onset of dissipation , and the associated landau criterion  @xcite .",
    "more recently , dragging of an obstacle in a two - component bec was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this latter study",
    "it was established that two distinct `` speeds of sound '' arise and the form of the ensuing nonlinear structures ( e.g. , dark - dark or dark - anti - dark soliton pairs in 1d , and vortex - vortex or vortex - lump pairs in 2d ) depend on how the value of the obstacle speed compares to the values of the critical speeds .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the dragging of a localized defect through an @xmath0 spinor condensate with repulsive spin - independent interactions and either ferromagnetic or anti - ferromagnetic ( polar ) spin - dependent interactions . in the framework of mean - field theory , this system is described by a set of coupled gp equations for the wavefunctions of the three hyperfine components .",
    "a key question that emerges in this @xmath0 spinor bec setting is how many critical speeds may be available .",
    "a naive count based on the three - component nature of the system ( and by analogy to the two - component setting bearing two such critical speeds ) would suggest the possibility for three distinct critical speeds .",
    "however , as we illustrate below , an explicit calculation reveals that there exist only two such critical speeds in the system , due to the particular nature of the nonlinearity .",
    "moreover , our numerical simulations illustrate that the crossing of the lower of the two critical speeds does not appear to lead to the formation of nonlinear excitations . on the other hand , for defect speeds larger than the second critical speed ,",
    "our simulations illustrate that dark solitons emerge in the 1d setting , vortex - antivortex pairs in the 2d setting , and vortex rings are shown to arise in the fully three - dimensional ( 3d ) setting .",

    "ii , we develop an analytical approach for computing the relevant critical speeds , by generalizing to the spinor setting the arguments of ref .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "iii , we numerically test the relevant predictions in 1d , 2d and 3d settings . finally , in sec .",
    "iv , we summarize our findings and point to some important remaining questions along this vein of research .",

    "our systematic analysis of the small - amplitude excitation problem revealed that the nature of the nonlinearity is such that there appear not three , but merely two critical speeds in the system ; these were identified analytically for the families of stationary uniform states of the system .",
    "our numerical simulations tested the dynamics for different values of defect speeds in comparison to the two critical speeds .",
    "surprisingly , it was found that the lower one among the two critical speeds is _ not _ activated and no emission of nonlinear wave excitations emerges when this threshold is crossed . on the other hand , when the defect speed exceeds the second critical one , then emission of coherent structures arises independently of dimension ; the resulting waveforms are dark solitons in the one - dimensional setting , vortex - antivortex pairs in two dimensions , and spinor vortex rings in the fully three - dimensional case .",
    "while the present study showcases an experimentally accessible mechanism for producing nonlinear excitations in spinor becs , a number of interesting questions are still outlying .",
    "in particular , perhaps the most relevant question from a theoretical point of view involves acquiring a full understanding of why the first critical speed does not seem to be explored by the system , contrary to what might be expected from the two - component case analyzed in ref .",
    "another direction of potential interest could be to explore in this multi - component system what would happen if the speed of the defect becomes considerably larger than the critical speed , in which case , and in the one - component setting , a convective stabilization of oblique dark solitons has been reported @xcite .",
    "also interesting would be to study the formation of shock waves @xcite in the spinor systems .",
    "work along these directions is currently in progress and will be reported in future publications .",
