    "motivation for studying the performance of gas electron multipliers ( gems ) at cryogenic temperatures stems from the ebubble project  @xcite , which aims to develop a low energy solar neutrino detector .",
    "the ebubble detector is currently envisioned as a two - phase detector which should operate in those liquids which allow the formation of electron bubbles  @xcite .    the ebubble detector is a time projection chamber - like ( tpc ) tracking detector .",
    "the expected signal from low energy solar neutrino interactions comes the measurement of ionization of elastically scattered target electrons .",
    "the ionization signals are expected to be small and hence the signal needs to be amplified in the saturated vapor above the liquid phase .",
    "gems can operate in noble gases at high gain  @xcite and cryogenic temperature  @xcite and therefore are naturally of interest .",
    "other applications for this detector include but are not limited to wimp detection  @xcite and positron emission tomography  @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup used in these studies was developed at columbia university nevis laboratories and at brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "figure  [ fig : setup ] illustrates the basic components of the setup .",
    "three gem foils and a photocathode were mounted in the tracking chamber .",
    "the chamber was connected to a support tube which was in direct contact with a cryogenic liquid reservoir .",
    "this tube also served as one port through which the gas could be filled into the chamber .",
    "a second method of filling the chamber was used which sealed the central line and rather filled through a tube which passed through the vacuum region isolated from the reservoir .",
    "the ebubble chamber is a double walled vessel .",
    "two copper cooling loops for the cryogen vapor - cooling circuits are soldered on the flanges of the chamber .",
    "a needle valve in the cryostat is used to supply and control the flow rate from the reservoir to the cooling circuits .",
    "measurements at temperatures between 77 - 293  k were performed by filling the reservoir with liquid nitrogen and measurements at temperatures down to 2  k were performed with liquid helium in the reservoir .",
    "the chamber was initially filled with he , ne and/or h@xmath0 taken directly from gas bottles with 99.999% quoted purities . the data from this gas supply will be henceforth referred to as `` pure '' gas .",
    "the gas could also be purified further by passing the gas through an oxisorb filter followed by a getter",
    ". the additional purification system impurity level to less than 1  ppb . for further purity performance specifications see http://www.puregastechnologies.com/ps4.htm . ]",
    "is presumed to reduce the level of impurities to 1  ppb .",
    "data from this further purified gas will be henceforth referred to as `` ultrapure '' for clarity .",
    "the photocathode was composed of a semitransparent gold film deposited on a quartz substrate .",
    "a uv window at the bottom allowed the transmission of light from a high - powered xe flash lamp to the the photocathode .",
    "the gems were produced at cern and had the following parameters : 50  @xmath2 m thick kapton , 70 and 55  @xmath2 m hole diameter on the copper and kapton respectively , and a 140  @xmath2 m hole pitch .",
    "the active area of the gems was 28@xmath328  mm@xmath4 .",
    "the gem foils were mounted on g10 frames with an inter - gem separation of 2  mm .",
    "the distance between the photocathode and the first gem was 10  mm .",
    "the gem electrodes were biased through a resistive high voltage divider placed outside the cryostat .",
    "it was comprised of three identical circuits connected in parallel and ensured an equal voltage drop across the gems and the gaps between them .",
    "the `` calibration '' signal was induced by electrons arriving at the first electrode of the first gem from the photocathode , i.e. before avalanche amplification . both avalanche and calibration signals",
    "were read out using a charge - sensitive preamplifier followed by a linear amplifier .",
    "the gain is defined as the pulse - height of the avalanche signal at the last gem divided by that of the calibration signal , at a shaping time of 10  @xmath2s .",
    "the drift field was @xmath5kv / cm .",
    "initial measurements were performed and published  @xcite in the setup described in section  [ sec : setup ] .",
    "the measurements in  @xcite were made with gas directly taken from gas bottles with 99.999% quoted purity and filled through the central tube .",
    "the performance of gems in gaseous he , ne and mixtures of ne and h@xmath0 was studied in the temperature range of 2.6 - 293  k. above 77  k in he , the triple - gem structures can operate at high gains exceeding 1000 .",
    "the transition from ln@xmath0 to lhe temperatures is characterized by an increase in the operating voltage and a dramatic decrease of the maximum gain .",
    "double and single - gem structures functioned at 2.6  k and a density of 0.5",
    "g / l at a gain of order 10 . at higher densities",
    "the gain drops further . at a density of 1.6",
    "g / l at 2.6k , the maximum gain observed in the double - gem is about 5 .",
    "this corresponds to a gas density about an order of magnitude less than saturated vapor density at 4.2k . at lower temperatures the slope of the gain - voltage curve also decreased which indicated a change in the avalanche mechanism .    in",
    "ne a similar effect was observed .",
    "however , in ne the drop in gain could be compensated for and even enhanced by the addition of a small fraction , @xmath6 of h@xmath0 .",
    "very high gains , 10@xmath1 , were obtained at 55  k and a density of 9.2  g / l which corresponds to the saturated vapor density of ne at 27  k.    one possible explanation for the observed suppression of the gem gain at low temperatures was the likelihood that the gain above 77  k was a result of penning ionization of impurities which freeze out as the temperature is lowered to order of 4  k.",
    "in order to test the impurity hypothesis , subsequent runs were performed with additional purification of the gas source as described in section  [ sec : setup ] .",
    "figure  [ helium ] shows the gain - voltage characteristics for a double - gem structure at 77  k and a density of 0.55",
    "g / l .     at 77  k and a density of 0.55",
    ", width=240 ]    there is a clear suppression of the gain in the ultrapure he as compared to the previous data taken with pure gas directly from the gas bottle .",
    "also shown is the effect of the addition of 0.1% of h@xmath0 which not only restores the large gain but enhances it further .    as the temperature is decreased to liquid helium temperatures the high gain attained at 77  k in the he+h@xmath0 mixture is lost .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ lowt_he ] , which shows the single - gem performance at a density of 1.7",
    "g / l .     at a density of 1.7",
    "g / l at 54  k and 4.4  k. , width=240 ]    the increased density and the decreased effect of other mechanisms , such as associative ionization which is presumed to decrease with temperature  @xcite , could both contribute to the loss in gain .",
    "however , at 4.4  k the h@xmath0 vapor pressure is negligible and hence any enhanced gain from penning ionization is lost at low temperatures .",
    "the effect of purifying the source ne gas on the gem gain is the same as in the case with he .",
    "figure  [ pureneon ] shows a comparison between pure and ultrapure ne gas data . as in the case between pure and ultrapure he , the ultrapure ne gas shows much lower gain , in a triple - gem , than the pure ne gas above 77  k. in addition",
    ", there is a further reduction in the signal between the 77  k and 30  k data which is not understood .        at low temperatures the problem of the gain drop",
    "is solved by the addition of a small amount of h@xmath0 .",
    "very high gains , 10@xmath1 , are observed ( see fig .  [ negain ] ) at 30  k and a density of 9.2",
    "g / l , which corresponds to the saturated ne vapor density at 27  k.     at 30 , 56 and 77  k at a density of 9.2",
    ", width=240 ]    the gas mixture for all the data shown in fig .",
    "[ negain ] was filled into the chamber at 77  k and kept for all the measurements .",
    "gain curve increases with decreasing temperature .",
    "one possible explanation for this is that the ne vapor pressure is falling faster than that of the h@xmath0 resulting in a different concentration of h@xmath0 at the various temperature points .",
    "another and more likely explanation is that there is a change in the concentration of h@xmath0 as a result of stratification that can occur due to the temperature gradient in the filling tube .    nonetheless , the observation of high gain in a triple - gem at saturated density makes the ne+h@xmath0 mixture a viable option for the ebubble two - phase detector .",
    "the aim of these studies was to investigate the performance of gems in ultrapure he and ne gases at low temperatures and high densities .",
    "these are the conditions required by an application to detect low energy solar neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "previously published measurements had shown high gains in gems operated in he above 62  k  @xcite , which decreased as the temperature was lowered .",
    "further measurements , presented in fig .  [ helium ] , show that with further purification of the he a significant reduction in the gain at 77  k occurs .",
    "this confirms the conclusion in  @xcite that the gain observed above 62  k is due to penning ionization of impurities in the he .",
    "the addition of a controlled impurity , namely h@xmath0 , restored and further enhanced the gain at 77  k and @xmath7g / l above the aforementioned measurements .",
    "figure  [ lowt_he ] further supported the supposition that the gain at high temperatures was a result of penning ionization on impurities . at 4  k in a he+h@xmath0 mixture",
    ", there was no gain since the vapor pressure of the h@xmath0 is neglibile at this temperature .",
    "some is observed at 54  k , where the h@xmath0 impurity affects the avalanche gain .    at 30  k and a density @xmath8g / l ,",
    "gains of order @xmath9 were achieved in an ultrapure ne+h@xmath0 mixture .",
    "higher gains were observed ( see fig .  [ negain ] ) in the same gas mixture with decreasing temperature .",
    "this was most likely due to a change in the h@xmath0 fraction in the mixture . the h@xmath0 concentration can change as a result of stratification that can occur due to the temperature gradient in the filling tube , or because the relative vapor pressure of ne was falling faster than that of the h@xmath0 at lower temperatures .",
    "the measurements presented in this paper indicate that impurities play a significant role in gem gains in he and ne at temperatures above 30  k. this conclusion is supported further by fig .",
    "[ he_alpha ] and fig .",
    "[ ne_alpha ] which show the ionization coefficients estimated from these measurements according to the prescription in  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ he_alpha ] shows that the ionization coefficients derived from the ultrapure he data lie close to the measurements taken from literature , where the primary mechanism for avalanche gain is attributed to electron impact ionization .",
    "all other data points , derived from he+h@xmath0 and ne+h@xmath0 mixtures , show enhanced ionization coefficients indicating that the additional gain is due to penning ionization on the h@xmath0 impurities .    .",
    "the data are compared to those taken from  @xcite .",
    "the values are calculated from double - gem data.,width=240 ]    .",
    "the data are compared to those taken from the  @xcite .",
    "the values are calculated from the triple - gem data.,width=240 ]",
    "the effect of gas purity on the performance of gems in he and ne was studied at low temperatures . when the gas supply was taken directly from gas bottles with 99.999% quoted purities , large gains",
    "were observed above 77  k. the gain drops significantly at lower temperatures which is predominantly due to the freezing out of impurities and hence the suppression of penning ionization of impurities .",
    "the gain was observed to decrease dramatically even at high temperatures after further purification of the gas supply , by additional filtering through oxisorb and a getter .",
    "high gains were restored for ne through the addition of a small amount of h@xmath0 .",
    "this gain persisted at levels on the order of 10@xmath1 at 30  k and a density which corresponds to saturated vapor density at 27  k. this makes the use of gems as a method of amplification of low - energy solar neutrino signals in liquid neon an attractive and viable option for the ebubble detector .",
