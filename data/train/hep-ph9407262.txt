    "searching for possible exotic states of nuclear matter is one of the currently most interesting and stimulating subjects in high energy nuclear physics ( see references [ 110 ] ) to create exotic matter such as the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) [ 14,5]strange matter @xcite,@xcite , multi@xmath11-matter , pion condensate , kaon condensate @xcite,@xcite it is essential to generate extreme states of nuclear matter regarding density , temperature or energy density @xcite .",
    "such extreme states are considered to be produced most probably in high energy heavy ion reactions[1014 ] or in the annihilation of energetic antiprotons(@xmath12)on a nucleus @xcite    the possibility suggested by witten @xcite that strange quark - matter might be the lowest energy state of large baryon number , would have many consequences in physics and astrophysics and also cosmology relevance [ 1620 ] . small drops of strange matter(strangelets ) may be natural results of the evaporation of a qgp formed in heavy ion collisions .",

    "new experimental data and also data on proton production in hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus interactions are required in order to draw a definite conclusions .    for transverse kinetic energy distributions ( taken into account the factor of two )",
    "we obtain a good agreement with the data except the low @xmath120 values and in some cases the values at the tails .",
    "the normalised transverse momentum distributions for @xmath193 interactions are well described except some discrepacies seen for @xmath15 ( see fig.9a , b , c ) .    the ratio of the @xmath19 and @xmath15 yields is suggested to reflect the net baryon density of the particle source . in fig.10",
    "the ratio of @xmath19 to @xmath15 rapidity distributions for @xmath191 is presented in comparison with experimental data .the theoretical values are higher than experimental ones .",
    "it should be stressed out that in the most string models the produced strings do not interact and decay independently .",
    "introduction of some collective effects like string fusion @xcite,@xcite or firecreacker model @xcite can change the predictions essentially , especially for rapidity plateau heights and high multiplicity distribution tails .",
    "some analysis was done recently by sorge @xcite , @xcitein the framework of the rqmd .a doubling of lambda production in the target fragmentation region for collision on heavy targets were found due to nuclear cascading of the produced mesons.also in rqmd approach the resonances play an important role in creating strange quark pairs.werner @xcite has shown that rescattering should be considered at cern - sps energies with the effect of increasing neutral strange particles production especially in the central region.hijing does not incorporate these ingredients .    no model seems to get a real description of absolute values for neutral strange particle production without additional mechanisms .",
    "since recently @xcite the data on multiple strange particle production ( @xmath194 ) was reported , in figures 11a - b we give rapidity distribution for full phase space @xmath16 ( fig.11a ) and @xmath195 ( fig.11b)for @xmath174 interaction .",
    "we can see from these figures that the ratio of multiplicities @xmath196 has strogly dependence on rapidity bins .",
    "improvement of the statistics and considerations of limited rapidity experimental intervals , are needed in order to due some more toward comparison with experimental data .    for giving an idea about of the abundances of particles produced in the near planed experiments at cern we have studied @xmath197 interaction at @xmath198 and in addition to multiplicities given in tabel 3 and tabel 5 ,",
    "normalised rapidity distributions are given in figures 12a  b for ( @xmath199 ) .",
    "the number of generated events was@xmath200 and the results are represented for full phase space .    the dependences rapidity - transvers momentum , which define theoretical values for acceptances as well as their bidimensional projections are also given in figures 13 a - b for @xmath15 , in figures 14 a - b for @xmath19 and for all negatives charges in @xmath186,@xmath201 and @xmath202 interactions in figures 15a , b;16a , b and 17a , b(respectively ) and for all positives charges in @xmath203 interactions in figures 18a - b .",
    "we hope that from such kind of correlations we will get more inside the dynamics of the systems and we will find some limits of the model concerning neutral strange particles production .",
    "in this report , we give a systematic study of strange particle production in pp , pa and aa collisions mainly at sps cern - energies , using hijing monte carlo model developed for high energy collisions .",
    "we analyse data from cern experiments ( na35,na36 , + wa85 ) and we give a detailed comparison for mean multiplicities of neutral strange particle for pp , ps , pag , pw , pau , ss , sw and pbpb interactions .",
    "one should note that hijing model includes neither hipotheses of qgp .",
    "strange particle abundances are quite well described in pp and pa collisions and are underpredicted by a factor of two in nucleus - nucleus interactions , by this version ( theoretical values for hij.01 ) .the ratios for multistrange particles could not be predicted by the model hij.01 .the abundances of @xmath16 and @xmath17 are underpredicted and the abundances of @xmath179 and @xmath180 are overpredicted .",
    "more carreful analisis are necessary in limited rapidity interval .",
    "we present also some calculations for the ratios @xmath204 and @xmath205 given by hijing model compared with other models predictions like venus and fritiof.all models seems to overpredict @xmath205 ratios and underpredict @xmath204 ratios .",
    "rescattering should be important even at sps -energies .    a qualitative prediction for rapidity distributions of neutral strange particles in @xmath206 , @xmath207,@xmath208,@xmath209 @xmath210per nucleon are done compared also with recent experimental data[140 ] .",
    "the models describes correctly the shapes of the rapidity in central @xmath211 collisions for @xmath212 and @xmath188 but absolute numbers for multiplicities are underestimated by a factor of two for @xmath213 in symmetric collisions and for @xmath214 in asymmetric ones .",
    "some discrepancies are seen for @xmath15 rapidity distribution and transverse momentum distributions even for @xmath190 interactions.the factor of two can not be explained taken into account minijets and very central events(@xmath215 ) .",
    "the theoretical model predictions hij.01 presented above for central @xmath201,@xmath184 and @xmath202 collisions give an idea for particle abundances in experiments which are under the way or are planned in the near future at cern .",
    "the hijing model simulations are however still somewhat too low compared to the data.also the ratios for multistrange baryons could not be described .",
    "new ideas are necessary in order to improve the comparison of theoretical calculations with experimental data.the main goal is to increase the rate of neutral strange particle production by a factor of two in nucleus - nucleus interaction at @xmath216 .",
    "we remark that other models ( qgsm , venus , dpm and psm ) include now some aditional hypothesis in order to improve the discrepancies ( colective string - string interactions , double or multiple colour exchanges , string fusion ) .",
    "one of the authors ( vtp ) would like to thank to professor miklos gyulassy and dr xin - nian wang for providing the monte carlo program hijing and many helpful communications .",
