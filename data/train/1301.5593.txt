    "it is well known that the day - to - night electricity usage is oscillatory , with a usage valley appearing through the night and a peak occurring during the day . at the same time ,",
    "high - frequency ( minute - to - minute and faster ) oscillation results from randomly occurring aggregations of individual loads with short duty cycle @xcite .",
    "the importance of reducing high - frequency peaks in usage is multi - fold .",
    "we can more easily maintain the stability of the grid with reduced amounts of generation reserves such that the grid frequency and voltage are stable .",
    "generation cost can be reduced since we will not use generators with large marginal costs . among all classes of electricity demand ,",
    "thermostatic loads have been a major contributor to problems of high peak usage @xcite . at the same time , thermostatic loads provide thermal capacity such that we can regulate their usage pattern as long as certain baseline thermal requirements are met .",
    "this paper presents an approach to carrying out such regulation by means of a novel information - based method for _ direct load control_.    historically , thermostatic loads ( air conditioners , electric space heating systems , water heaters , etc . ) have been operated in an uncoordinated fashion resulting in the power grid being exposed to costly random load fluctuations .",
    "taking note of the past decades s development of networked control system technologies @xcite and novel concepts enabled by smart appliances , such as the so - called _ internet of things _",
    "@xcite , we shall study the control of a local network of loads wherein the objective of control is to suppress spikes and fluctuations in usage .",
    "the approach uses real - time data from individual devices and local temperature sensors communicating with a central operator who distributes quantized amounts of energy to service the load demands according to a protocol for _ direct load control _ ( dlc ) that we shall describe below .",
    "various approaches have been proposed to formulate the dlc problem with the objective of peak load management .",
    "the load curve has been studied using a state - queueing model where thermal set points are adjusted automatically as a function of electricity price or outside temperature in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "dynamic programming has been applied in @xcite to minimize the production cost in a unit commitment problem , and in @xcite to minimize the disutility of consumers resulting from dlc disruption .",
    "monte carlo simulation has been applied in @xcite to evaluate the effectiveness of a specific dlc approach which minimized the discomfort of overall temperature deviation subject to constraints in transmission lines .",
    "multi - server queueing theory has been used to calculate the mean waiting time of consumers when the usage authorization is limited during peak hours in @xcite .",
    "this system has been applied in a total of 449 residential units located in seoul with good performance .",
    "the objective of our approach is to monitor and control aggregate electricity use in order to avoid random spikes in demand that would otherwise occur .",
    "the mechanism that implements the approach is something that we call _ packetized _ direct load control ( pdlc ) .",
    "the term _ packetized _ refers to the idea of _ time - packetized _ energy where the central operator authorizes electricity usage of individual loads for a fixed amount of time @xmath0 .",
    "after the elapse of time @xmath0 , the central operator reschedules the authorization . for each building , the central operator is connected to the on / off switch of thermostatic loads ( fan coils or room air conditioners ) .",
    "users in the building are assumed to authorize the operator to control the on / off switch of their thermostatic smart appliances once they provide the operator their preferred temperature set point .",
    "the central operator , who receives thermal information on all the appliances at each decision instant , has the objective to maintain all appliances within their comfort band by selectively turning on or off these thermostatic loads at discrete time instants .",
    "the pdlc provides flexibility in adjusting building consumption since we are actually dealing with a discrete time decision making problem where the central operator schedules packets at the beginning of each interval .",
    "it will be shown that given a minimum critical level of energy capacity , it is possible to both eliminate demand peaks and guarantee a narrow comfort band around each consumer s preferred temperature setting . in a theoretical sense , it is further shown that the width of the comfort band can be made to approach zero by letting the packet length approach zero , although practically speaking the cycle time of an air conditioning unit can not be made arbitrarily short . in the end ,",
    "the pdlc solution is able to smooth the consumption oscillations , and this in turn enables buildings to consume smaller amounts of reserves dispatched from the iso .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ two ] introduces the set up of the pdlc mechanism , followed by the investigation of a thermal model in section [ three ] .",
    "section [ four ] and [ five ] discuss the transient and steady state operation of the pdlc solution respectively .",
    "section [ link section ] discusses an allocation solution to link theorem 1 and theorem 2 .",
    "a robustness analysis is given in section [ six ] .",
    "section [ seven ] provides simulation results .",
    "section [ eight ] concludes the paper and proposes future work .",
    "this section describes the model in terms of which the pdlc mechanism is proposed .",
    "the following few points compose the background of the proposed approach .",
    "\\(1 ) the pdlc controls the thermostatic loads in a building , such as air conditioners , refrigerators , and water heaters .",
    "the thermal dynamic model of these appliances does not differ much ; the investigation of the thermal model of air conditioners in the next section can be extended to other thermostatic loads with minor change .",
    "\\(2 ) the pdlc is assumed to be an on / off control .",
    "all the appliances are assumed to running with rated power if packet is authorized , or consume nothing if packet authorization is denied .",
    "there is no intermediate operation choice .",
    "\\(3 ) different feeders are in charge of different types of loads , and they are all connected to the central operator who schedules electricity packets .",
    "the loads that have been grouped together in the same feeder consume energy at the same rates when they are operating .",
    "the overall consumption of the building is the sum of the consumption in each feeder controlled by the pdlc mechanism plus a certain portion of uncontrollable loads , including lighting and plug - in devices such as computers , televisions , and other small appliances .",
    "we assume that the consumption of the uncontrollable loads is independent of thermostatic loads and the environments ( temperature , humidity , etc . ) , and these uncontrollable loads are subtracted from the analysis of the pdlc framework .",
    "\\(4 ) it is assumed that the target level of consumption in each feeder of thermostatic load is available beforehand , which is defined as the average consumption during peak time when no control is applied .",
    "the value of the proposed method rests on the evidence - based assumption that the consumption curve without control would oscillate around the target level , and consumption peaks will frequently exceed the target level by a significant amount .",
    "the control objective of the pdlc is to make the consumption curve smoother around the target level with minimum oscillation .",
    "a model of the thermal dynamics of an air conditioner is developed as follows .",
    "ihara and schweppe presented a dynamic model for the temperature of a house regulated by air conditioning , and this has been shown to capture the behaviour of air conditioner loads accurately @xcite .",
    "the temperature dynamics in continuous time ( ct ) is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the outside temperate , @xmath3 is the temperature gain of air conditioner if it is on , @xmath4 is the effective thermal time constant of the room , and @xmath5 is binary valued specifying the state of thermostat .",
    "the unit of parameters is fahrenheit as in the original paper .",
    "the temperature dynamic model in discrete time ( dt ) with interval @xmath0 is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8=@xmath9 , and @xmath10 is @xmath5 s value during the @xmath11-th interval .",
    "we first derive the duty cycle off - time @xmath12 and on - time @xmath13 based on the ct model for the case in which there is no pdlc and the air conditioner is operating in the traditional way under the control of its own thermostat . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the comfort band boundaries . to get @xmath12 , we set @xmath16 in ( [ ct ] ) , which means that the air conditioner is turned off .",
    "rearranging terms we have @xmath17 whose general solution is given by @xmath18 since @xmath12 is the time that temperature arises from @xmath15 to @xmath14 in the case of traditional thermostat control , we choose initial condition @xmath19 to solve for @xmath12 .",
    "see fig.[duty ] .",
    "the overall solution of temperature evolution is given then by @xmath21 the value of @xmath12 would satisfy @xmath22 .",
    "after calculation we will have @xmath23 similarly we calculate @xmath13 when @xmath24 , @xmath25        the traditional duty cycle dynamics characterized by @xmath12 and @xmath13 provide the baseline against which the pdlc protocol of the next section is evaluated .",
    "to evaluate the pdlc solution , we consider its transient and steady state operation .",
    "the next section will discuss its transient operation .",
    "the motivation of the pdlc solution is to allow buildings consume electricity at a level that minimizes oscillation close to a target .",
    "denote the total number of consumers by @xmath26 , the number of authorized packets by @xmath27 , the set point in room @xmath28 by @xmath29 , and the room temperature in room @xmath28 at time @xmath11 by @xmath30 .",
    "the transient process is defined as the duration before the average room temperature converges to the average room set point @xmath31 .",

    "the larger the value of @xmath63 ( or @xmath56 ) , the quicker the convergence .",
    "if @xmath27 in ( [ revise number packet ] ) is not an integer , we can choose the ceil @xmath64 as the number of packets scheduled .",
    "the proof remains valid under this choice .",
    "theorem 1 indicates that the average consumption is proportional to the total population @xmath26 by the coefficient @xmath65 .",
    "the physical meaning of this coefficient is the thermostat mean status .",
    "define @xmath66 representing the mean on - status and off - status of the thermostat .",
    "these two variables will be used in the second theorem for the steady state analysis of the pdlc . note",
    "that an essential implicit assumption is that @xmath67 , i.e. there is enough cooling capacity to serve the consumer population .",
    "when no control is applied , each air conditioner will operate according to its own duty cycle as described in sec.[three ] .",
    "all the room temperatures are controlled around their respective set points , and the average room temperature is approximately equal to the average room set point , namely @xmath68 . from the first theorem",

    "we say that the system is in _ steady state _ at time @xmath11 if it is in sste and @xmath69 for all @xmath28 .",
    "when the pdlc solution is applied in steady state , consumers in each room have the freedom to choose the set point to be whatever they want .",
    "after the set point is given , the operator will choose the comfort band for consumers around their preferred setting . the comfort band may be large or small , depending on the outside temperature and the energy we have purchased a day ahead .",

    "for example , the value of @xmath194 will satisfy @xmath196 compared with ( [ pack ] ) , the only difference is that the term @xmath2 in ( [ pack ] ) is replaced by @xmath197 .",
    "hence the disturbance in ( [ rct ] ) can be understood as the uncertainty introduced by the outside temperature .",
    "also , the above @xmath194 is smaller than the @xmath198 in lemma 1 .",
    "this is no surprise since the existence of uncertainty forces us to switch packets more frequently .",
    "we simulate air conditioner temperature control process to verify theoretical results .",
    "environmental parameters are @xmath199 .",
    "consumers preferred set point is @xmath200 for all @xmath28 .",
    "after calculation we choose @xmath201 .",
    "fig.3 is the process of warm load pick up .",
    "fig.[wp2 ] shows that the average room temperature converges to the set point when we applied the number of packets at time @xmath11 as a function of @xmath54 , which verifies theorem 1 .",
    "compared with fig.[wp3 ] where no control is applied , the consumption oscillation by the pdlc solution is reduced by a large amount after the system evolves into sste .",
    "the oscillation magnitude in fig.[wp3 ] continues to exist if we simulate for longer time .",
    "[ wp ]    fig.4 is the steady state process where all the rooms have their initial temperatures randomly distributed within their comfort bands .",
    "we see two main advantages of our pdlc solution .",
    "first , the maximum and minimum room temperature are controlled within the comfort band in steady state , which can not be achieved without control since then the disturbance drives the temperature outside the comfort band .",
    "second , the consumption process is smoother with pdlc solution than in the stochastic uncontrolled case .",
    "[ ss ]      consider the simulation of multiple appliances . the controllable thermostatic loads are air conditioners and refrigerators .",
    "we also add uncontrollable loads , such as lighting and plug - in devices .",
    "the thermal characteristics of the refrigerator is similar to the air conditioner .",
    "refrigerator parameters is given by @xmath202 , we choose @xmath203 .",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath12 are around 20 minutes according to ( [ toff ] ) and ( [ ton ] ) , which is typical duty cycle of refrigerator @xcite .",
    "we assume there are 60 refrigerators each consuming around 600 watts of power .",
    "the air conditioner consumes around @xmath204 each .",
    "there is also an industrial chiller that consumes with small variation in steady state , which is uniformly distributed between @xmath205kw$ ] .",
    "uncontrollable loads are uniformly distributed between @xmath206kw$ ] .",
    "table.1 shows the comparison result between the pdlc solution and the case when no control is applied .",
    "we find that standard deviation of consumption by the pdlc solution is nearly half of that without control .",
    "also the maximum electric usage is reduced nearly @xmath207 from above its average .",
    ".comparison of consumption statistics [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "this paper proposes an innovative pdlc solution for demand side management .",
    "we have discussed a thermal dynamic model of typical thermostatic appliances and derived a mathematical expression of its duty cycle .",
    "three theorems are proposed to illustrate overall pdlc solution .",
    "the first theorem proves the convergence of the average room temperature to average room set point .",
    "the second theorem provides comfort band choice such that we can guarantee effective temperature control in steady state .",
    "the third theorem builds the bridge between the first two theorems .",
    "simulation shows that the pdlc solution can provide comfortable temperature control with minimum consumption oscillation , and reduce consumption peaks at the same time .",
    "future research will compare the performance of the pdlc as described here with comparable distribution control approaches using market based signaling .",
    "renewable energy sources will be included , and the dynamics of an appliance pool operator buying and selling resources under different communication protocols will be studied .",
