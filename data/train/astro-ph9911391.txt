    "uligs are an important class of extragalactic objects that appear to powered by a mixture of starburst and agn activity , both of which are fueled by an enormous supply of molecular gas that has been funneled into the nuclear region during the merger of two gas - rich spirals .",
    "uligs rival quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) in bolometric luminosity , and there is speculation that uligs may indeed represent an important stage in the formation of qsos as well as powerful radio galaxies , and that they may also represent a primary stage in the formation of giant ellipticals ( see sanders & mirabel 1996 for a more complete review ) .",
    "a complete sample of 115 uligs ( @xmath13jy ) was compiled by kim ( 1995 ; see also kim & sanders 1998 ) from redshift surveys of objects in the _ iras _ faint source catalog ( fsc : moshir et al .",
    "1992 ) . as the nearest and brightest uligs , the ",
    "1-jy sample \" provides the best list of objects for detailed multiwavelength studies .",
    "optical spectroscopy for the entire sample has recently been published by veilleux , kim , & sanders ( 1999 ) , and near - ir spectra have been published for 60% of the total sample by veilleux , sanders , & kim ( 1999 ) .",
    "high - resolution , tip - tilt , optical and near - ir images have just recently been obtained for the entire sample and these data are currently being reduced .    here",
    "we present further analysis of the original data from kim ( 1995 ) in order to highlight the first intriguing results from a comparison of the host galaxy properties of uligs with recently published data on the hosts of qsos .",
    "photometric ccd images of a subset of the 115 uligs in the iras 1-jy sample were originally obtained at k - band filter .",
    "these data have been converted to the standard k - band using the small correction terms given in wainscoat & cowie ( 1992 ) ] ( 37/115 ) and r - band ( 83/115 ) using the quirc 256@xmath14256 infrared camera ( hodapp , rayner , & irwin 1992 ) and tek 2048@xmath142048 optical ccd camera , respectively on the university of hawaii ( uh ) 2.2 m telescope on mauna kea .",
    "details of the observations , data reduction , and photometry can be found in kim ( 1995 ) .",
    "one of the basic properties of uligs , and perhaps the most straightforward to measure , is the total magnitude of the host galaxy and any point - like nuclear source that may be present .",
    "kim ( 1995 ) found that the mean total magnitudes of uligs in the 1-jy sample were @xmath53@xmath15 and @xmath52.7@xmath8 , with a sample range of a factor of @xmath53@xmath16 in both bands .",
    "these mean values are similar to the magnitudes of giant ellipticals ( ges ) and brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) .",
    "kim ( 1995 ) classified @xmath51/3 of the r - band images of uligs as elliptical - like based on a reasonable @xmath10-law fit to the radial surface brightness profile over a relatively large range of host galaxy radius , typically @xmath17210kpc .",
    "an example of these  e - like \" uligs is iras05189 - 2524 shown in figure 1 .",
    "a majority of these objects have seyfert1 optical or near - ir spectra , ( similar to the recent results reported by zheng et al .",
    "1999 ) , hence the apt description of these  e - like \" uligs as  infrared qsos \" .",
    "an additional @xmath51/3 of the r - band images were classified as",
    " e / sp \" to describe the fact that an @xmath10 law was a better fit than an exponential - disk model over a large range of galactocentric radius .",
    "the remaining @xmath51/3 of the 1-jy uligs were divided between a few spiral - like hosts ( i.e. good exponential fit ) , highly distorted  amorphous \" hosts ( typically closely spaced double nuclei where exponential - law and @xmath10-law descriptions were equally bad fits ; iras22491 - 1808 in figure 1 is a good example ) , and a few objects with largely non - overlapping disks where a single - host picture was clearly inappropriate .    in comparing the r - band and k - band radial profiles of the uligs",
    ", there were both widespread differences as well as similarities .",
    "for example , in the complete sample strong point - like nuclei at r - band are relatively rare ; the fraction of the total r - band light within the inner 2kpc radius is typically @xmath420% .",
    "however , the k - band surface brightness profiles are nearly always more centrally peaked , ( e.g. iras05189 - 2524 ; see figure 1 ) . as for the hosts , the distribution of host types (  e - like \" ,  e / sp \" , etc . )",
    "was generally the same at k - band as that found at r - band with the only caveat being that the moderate depth of the k - band images meant that the galactocentric radius of the outermost measured k - band contour was typically @xmath52/3 that of the outer r - band contour .",
    "figure 2 shows the distribution of host galaxy magnitudes for the subsample of  single - nucleus \" objects in the iras 1-jy sample , their r@xmath18k colors and the half - light radii and surface brightness ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) derived from an @xmath10-law fit to the 1-d radial brightness profiles .",
    "this analysis is similar to the analysis carried out by kim ( 1995 ) , except here we have subtracted off any obvious nuclear point source that may be present in the images of the 1-jy uligs .",
    "an immediate result is that nearly all uligs reside in hosts with luminosities above @xmath19 .",
    "the mean host luminosities are 2.7@xmath20 and 2.2@xmath21 .",
    "the radial surface brightness profiles over the range @xmath22@xmath5210kpc are well - fit by a devaucouleurs @xmath10-law , whereas the light distribution in the inner few kpc is more schizophrenic , most likely due to both heavy dust obscuration as well as a recent luminous starburst . given these observations , and the reasonable assumption from continuity arguments that the non  e - like \" uligs will soon resemble their slightly more evolved ",
    "e - like \" cousins , it would appear that uligs in general reside in luminous hosts that are similar in many ways to ges and bcgs .",
    "one of the most interesting new results from the current study of  e - like \" uligs is that their mean luminosities at r- and k - band are _ nearly identical _ to that found previously for the hosts of qsos ( e.g. mcleod & rieke 1994 , 1995 ; disney et al . 1995 ; boyce et al .",
    "1996 ; taylor et al . 1996",
    "; sanders & surace 1997 ; hutchings 1997 ; bahcall et al . 1997 ; surace 1998 ; mclure et al .",
    "as shown in figure 2 , even the range of luminosities for ulig hosts appears similar to the range observed for qso hosts , typically 110@xmath19 at both k - band ( taylor et al .",
    "1996 ) and r - band ( mclure et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the range of r@xmath18k color of the hosts of uligs and qsos are similar ( typically 2.53.5mag ) , with the exception of a few red uligs with r@xmath18k@xmath234mag .",
    "however , the radial surface brightness distributions clearly show systematic differences , with the half - light radii at r - band and k - band for uligs being as much as a factor of 2.5 and 3.5 less respectively than found for the hosts of qsos .",
    "thus despite the overall similarity in host total magnitudes , there is clearly an excess of emission in the inner disks of ir - selected uligs as compared with optically - selected qsos .",
    "uligs in the local universe ( @xmath3@xmath40.3 ) reside in luminous hosts with mean luminosities @xmath523@xmath19 at r- and k - band .",
    "continuity arguments suggest that ulig hosts are evolving into giant ellipticals .",
    "the properties of uligs which already have  e - like \" hosts are quite similar to those of qsos , but with an excess of emission at k - band in the inner several kpc radius , perhaps due to a population of red giants from an aging powerful circumnuclear starburst .",
    "these results lend further support to the hypothesis that uligs may be the infrared precursors to optically - selected qsos .",
