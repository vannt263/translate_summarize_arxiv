    "the control and manipulation of mesoscopic mechanical resonators by radiation pressure has fueled enormous interest in the use of optomechanical systems for applications to sensing , transduction and optomechanical information processing , as well as for foundational tests of quantum mechanics in the macroscopic domain @xcite . while cavity optomechanics has seen remarkable advances in recent years",
    ", the preparation of mesoscopic mechanical resonators in the quantum regime remains a significant challenge .",
    "in particular , the requirements for ground state cooling include the ability to isolate the resonator from environmental sources of dissipation as well as the realization of a cavity optomechanical system in the ` resolved - sideband ' regime @xcite . both these requirements become particularly challenging for optomechanical systems characterized by low frequency ( @xmath0 1 mhz ) mechanical resonators .",
    "thus , for optomechanical systems operating in the optical domain , ground state cooling has , to date , only been demonstrated by the use of high frequency mechanical resonators and cryogenic cooling to reduce the thermal coupling to the environment @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", low frequency resonators are particularly compelling for a variety of sensing applications due to the long coherence times and large zero - point motion , and methods to cool such resonators to the quantum regime will enable a variety of technical applications as well as fundamental studies .    a promising avenue to circumvent the limitations inherent to optomechanical cooling is the use of an auxiliary quantum system that can enhance the effective optomechanical response of the resonator .",
    "several proposals involving such hybrid schemes @xcite and other approaches  @xcite have been advanced to improve the performance of cavity cooling . coupling a cold atomic ensemble to the mechanical resonator",
    "is of particular interest due to the precise control , wide tunability and strong optical interactions exhibited by atomic systems @xcite .",
    "this article investigates the hybrid optical interaction between a cavity optomechanical system and an ensemble of ultracold atoms .",
    "we consider the situation where the mechanical resonator and the ultracold gas are embedded within distinct optical cavities that interact via a common ` coupling ' laser ( see fig .",
    "in addition to alleviating technical constraints , this modular approach also represents a powerful method to combine the coherence , sensitivity and tunability of the atoms with the robustness and scalability of the optomechanical device .",
    "as discussed below , the atomic gas is described as a three - level @xmath1 system whose optical response to the coupling light field can be modified by a strong ` control ' field .",
    "such @xmath1 configurations in atomic ensembles exhibit narrow resonances due to the competition between dissipation and dispersion .",
    "we consider specifically two well - known and complementary approaches towards that goal , electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite and recoil induced resonances ( rir )  @xcite . in either case , and for experimentally demonstrated values of the quality factor and of the @xmath2 product for the mechanical resonator @xcite and the cavity optomechanical system ,",
    "we find a broad and robust range of parameters for which the mechanical resonator can be cooled to its quantum ground state from room temperature",
    ".    in eit , quantum interference between different excitation pathways to the same atomic level induces a narrow transparency window for the propagation of a weak resonant field that can be controlled via an external ` control ' laser .",
    "the effect may be tuned by separating two lower - lying states via e.g. zeeman splitting by means of an additional magnetic field .",
    "intracavity eit has already been proposed for cooling and entanglement in an optomechanical setup @xcite . here",
    ", we explore a new regime in separate cavities and we obtain the surprising result of a very effective blue - sideband cooling .    in contrast , rir is generated when the exchange of energy between the control and the coupling lasers is resonant with the transition between different atomic momentum states .",
    "this nonlinear effect can be tuned by changing the frequencies of the lasers or the intensity of the control field . in particular , long - lived momentum coherences , narrow",
    "resonance features and large gain in the coupling beam amplitude have been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "we show that this spectrally narrow gain feature enhances the asymmetry between the optical sidebands at the mechanical frequency , which in turn leads to efficient cooling .",

    "the improvement in optomechanical cooling is due to the narrow transparency window at the two - photon resonance that enhances the spectral asymmetry between the stokes and anti - stokes sidebands induced by mechanical motion . in the case of the rir , optical gain enhances the anti - stokes sideband leading to enhanced cooling .",
