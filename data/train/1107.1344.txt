    "black holes ( bh ) are fundamental physical objects predicted classically in general relativity ( gr ) which show a very deep relation between gravitation , thermodynamics , and quantum theory@xcite .",
    "classically , the characteristic feature of a bh is its event horizon eh : the boundary of the region from where one can send signals to a far away asymptotic external region .",
    "this eh is usually identified as the surface of the bh and its area to the entropy .",
    "unfortunately , the eh is essentially a global object , as it depends on the _ whole _ future evolution of the spacetime .",
    "thus , ehs are determined by future causes , they are _ teleological _ , see@xcite and references therein .",
    "however , it is important to recognize the presence of a bh locally , for instance in numerical gr@xcite , in the 3 + 1 or cauchy - problem perspective of gr@xcite ( see also jaramillo s contribution in this volume ) , or in astrophysics . in the former two",
    ", one needs to pinpoint when the bh region has been entered , while in the latter there are so many candidates to real bhs that a precise meaning of the sentence `` there is a bh in the region such and such '' is required .",
    "of course , this meaning can not rely on the existence of an eh as the real bhs undergo evolutionary processes and are usually dynamical .    over the recent years",
    ", there has been a number of efforts to give a general quasi - local description of a dynamical black hole . in particular , the case has been made for quasi - local objects called marginally trapped tubes ( mtt ) or trapping horizons ( th)@xcite , and their particular cases called _ dynamical horizons _ ( dh ) @xcite or future outer trapping horizons ( foth)@xcite . the underlying ideas were discussed in the 90s by hayward@xcite .",
    "mtts are hypersurfaces foliated by closed ( compact without boundary ) marginally trapped surfaces .",
    "it is accepted that closed ( marginally ) trapped surfaces constitute the most important ingredient in the formation of bhs , so that the idea of using mtts as the surface of bhs , and as viable replacements for the eh , looked very promising .",
    "this is one of the main reasons to study trapped surfaces , the subject of this contribution .",
    "unfortunately , mtts have an important problem : they are highly non - unique@xcite .",
    "this manifests itself because the 2-dimensional apparent horizons@xcite depend on the choice of a reference foliation of spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "hence , another reasonable alternative , which is manifestly independent of any foliation , has been pursued and investigated more recently@xcite : the boundary @xmath0 of the future - trapped region @xmath1 in spacetime ( this is the region through which future - trapped surfaces pass ) .",
    "this is also a very natural candidate for the surface of a bh , as it defines a frontier beyond which mtts and general trapped surfaces can not be placed .",
    "i am going to show that @xmath0 can not be an mtt itself , and that it suffers from problems similar to that of ehs : it is unreasonably global .",
    "this seems to be an intrinsic problem linked to a fundamental property of closed trapped surfaces : they are _",
    "clairvoyant_@xcite .",
    "recently , a novel idea@xcite has been put forward to address all these issues : the _ core _ of a trapped region , and its boundary .",
    "this is a minimal region which is indispensable to sustain the existence of closed trapped surfaces in the spacetime .",
    "it has some interesting features and it may help in solving , or better understanding , the difficulties associated to bhs .",
    "in 1965 , penrose@xcite introduced a new important concept : _ closed trapped surfaces_. these are closed spacelike surfaces ( usually topological spheres ) such that their area tends to decrease locally along any possible _ future _ direction .",

    "therefore , a symbolic notation for the causal orientation of @xmath43 becomes very useful .",

    "in the construction of the previous section , in general the mean curvature vector @xmath43 of the @xmath76-surfaces will change its causal character at different regions of the spacetime . the hypersurface(s ) of separation @xmath77",
    "is a fundamental place in @xmath2 associated to the given family of surfaces @xmath51 called the @xmath78horizon .",

    "however , in many situations the `` outer '' condition in hayward s definition is not required to obtain results about mtts , and at the same time there are speculations that in dynamical situations describing the collapse to a realistic black hole the mtts will eventually become spacelike .",

    "these preferred mtts can be invariantly defined by @xmath112 despite this fact , it is known that mtts , even in spherical symmetry , are not unique@xcite , an explicit proof of this fact in generic spherically symmetric spacetimes can be found in ref . , see corollary [ coro ] below .",
    "the non - uniqueness of mtts poses a difficult problem for the physics of black holes , and casts some doubts on whether mtts provide a good quasi - local definition of the surface of a black hole .",
    "it is also a manifestation that the @xmath50-dimensional apparent horizons will depend on a chosen foliation in the spacetime .",
    "thus , a reasonable alternative is to consider the boundary of the region containing f - trapped surfaces .",

    "based on the previous result , and with the aid of a very strong and fundamental result found in ref .",
    "concerning the existence of mots between outer trapped and outer untrapped surfaces ( see also ref . ) , one can also derive a result on the existence of non - spherical mtts , see ref ..    in arbitrary spherically symmetric spacetimes there exist mtts penetrating both sides of the apparent 3-horizon @xmath193 at any region where @xmath169.[coro ]    actually , all spacelike mtts ( that is , dhs ) other than ah must lie partly to the future of ah and partly to its past , as proven in ref ..    no closed weakly f - trapped surface can be fully contained in the past domain of dependence @xmath194 of a spacelike ah .",
    "[ th : ag ]    however , closed f - trapped surfaces may lie on @xmath194 almost completely . in other words , closed f - trapped surfaces can intersect the region @xmath195 in just an arbitrarily tiny portion , as small as desired .",
    "this surprising result was obtained in ref . and will be of fundamental importance for the concept of `` core '' of a black hole , see section [ sec : cores ] . more precisely :    in spherically symmetric spacetimes , there are closed f - trapped surfaces ( topological spheres ) penetrating both sides of the apparent 3-horizon @xmath168 with arbitrarily small portions outside the region @xmath196 .",
    "[ th : tiny ]",
    "now that we have learnt that closed f - trapped surfaces can extend beyond the spherically symmetric mtt , one can wonder haw far can they go . in particular , one can ask whether or not they can extend all the way ` down ' to the flat portions of the spacetime , if they exist . again , the surprise is that they do extend and penetrate flat portions ( under some circumstances ) .",
    "this was proven , via an explicit example , in ref .",
    ", later refined with more elaborated examples in ref .. the chosen spacetime was a particular simple case of the vaidya spacetime ( [ vaidya ] ) , defined by the explicit mass function @xmath197 where @xmath198 is a constant and @xmath82 is the total mass , also a constant .",
    "thus , this is flat for @xmath144 , it ends in a schwarzschild region with mass @xmath82 ( @xmath199 ) , and it happens to be self - similar in the intermediate vaidya region for @xmath200 .",

    "this implies that they are highly non - local : they can have portions in a flat region of spacetime whose _ whole _",
    "past is also flat in clairvoyance of energy that crosses them elsewhere to make their compactness feasible .",
    "they are _ clairvoyant _ , that is to say , ` aware ' of things that happen elsewhere , far away , with no causal connection .    observe finally that this result also implies that the boundary @xmath0 of the f - trapped region may penetrate the flat regions too .",
    "hitherto , we have proven that the boundary @xmath0 of the f - trapped region must be generically below the spherically symmetric mtt defined by ah : @xmath220 , but it can not extend all the way down to the event horizon eh . in order to try to put restrictions on the location of @xmath0 and the extension of @xmath1 we use the following fundamental property@xcite    [ prop:1 ] no f - trapped surface ( closed or not ) can touch a spacelike hypersurface to its past at a single point , or have a 2-dimensional portion contained in the hypersurface , if the latter has a positive semi - definite second fundamental form .    before giving the main steps for the proof of this basic result , the intuitive idea behind it can be understood by means of the following figure [ f9 ] . as we saw in fig.[f3 ] , f - trapped surfaces ( closed or not ) have to bend down in `` time '' , if this time has some appropriate properties .",
    "in particular , if the time defines a foliation by hypersurfaces with positive semi - definite second fundamental forms , then fig.[f9 ] shows that there is no way that the surface can touch tangentially , to its past ( in `` time '' ) , any such level hypersurface .",
    "thus , one can use ( generalized ) symmetries , or equivalently some distinguished hypersurface - orthogonal future - pointing vector fields such as ( conformal , homothetic ) killing vectors , kerr - schild vector fields@xcite , the kodama vector field in spherically symmetric spacetimes , etcetera to constrain the possible existence of f - trapped surfaces .",
    "this interplay between surfaces and generalized symmetries has proven very useful in several investigations concerning the trapped - surface fauna@xcite .    to prove the fundamental property given in proposition [ prop:1 ] and related interesting results , start with the identity for the lie derivative of the metric along a vector field @xmath221 @xmath222 projecting to the surface @xmath7 and using ( [ proj ] ) @xmath223 so that contracting now with @xmath224 we arrive at the main formula [ main ] where @xmath225 is the orthogonal projector of @xmath7 .",
    "this elementary formula is very useful and permits to obtain many interesting , immediate , consequences .",
    "for instance :    1 .   if @xmath7 is minimal ( @xmath226 ) , integrating the formula for closed @xmath7 @xmath227 this relation must be satisfied for _ all _ possible vector fields @xmath228 . therefore , closed minimal surfaces are very rare .",

    "more sophisticated and useful consequences can be derived , such as@xcite    let @xmath228 be future - pointing on a region @xmath230 and let @xmath7 be a closed surface contained in @xmath231 with @xmath232 .",
    "then , @xmath7 can not be closed and weakly f - trapped ( unless @xmath233 and @xmath234 . ) [ lemma ]    integrating the main formula on @xmath7 , the divergence term integrates to zero so that @xmath235 hence , @xmath43 can not be future pointing on all @xmath7 ( unless @xmath236 . )    stronger results can be obtained for _ hypersurface - orthogona_l @xmath228 , that is , @xmath228 satisfying @xmath237}=0 \\hspace{2 mm } \\longleftrightarrow \\hspace{2 mm } \\xi_{\\mu}=-f \\partial_{\\mu } \\tau\\ ] ] for some local functions @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",

    "this is an open question .",

    "the clairvoyance property of trapped surfaces is inherited by everything based on them , such as marginally trapped tubes including dynamical horizons .",
    "it implies that eh is teleological and that @xmath0 is also non - local , even penetrating sometimes into flat portions of the spacetime . in conjunction with the non - uniqueness of dynamical horizons , this poses a fundamental puzzle for the physics of black holes .",
    "four possible solutions have been put forward@xcite    1 .",
    "one can rely on the old and well defined event horizon , and try to put up with its teleological properties .",
    "2 .   one can accept the non - uniqueness of mtts and treat all possible mtts and dynamical / trapping horizons on equal footing .",
    "3 .   one can also use the boundary @xmath0 as defined above , despite its non - local properties .",
    "4 .   or one can try to define a preferred mtt . hitherto , the only proposal i am aware of was presented in ref .",
    ", based on an evolution principle for the area ( entropy ) of the marginally trapped surfaces foliating the mtt .    in ref .",
    "we have put forward a novel strategy .",
    "the idea is based on the simple question : _ what part of the spacetime is absolutely indispensable for the existence of the black hole ?",
    "_ surely enough , any flat region is certainly not essential for the existence of the black hole .",
    "what is ?",
    "a region @xmath308 is said to be a _",
    "core _ of the f - trapped region @xmath1 if it is a minimal closed connected set that needs to be removed from the spacetime in order to get rid of all closed f - trapped surfaces in @xmath1 , and such that any point on the boundary @xmath309 is connected to @xmath310 in the closure of the remainder .    here , ",
    "minimal \" means that there is no other set @xmath311 with the same properties and properly contained in @xmath308 .",
    "the final technical condition is needed because one could identify a particular removable region to eliminate the f - trapped surfaces , excise it , but then put back a tiny but central isolated portion to make it smaller . however",
    ", this is not what one wants to cover with the definition .",
    "obviously , @xmath312 , but in general @xmath308 is substantially smaller than the corresponding trapped region @xmath1 .",
    "an example of a core is given by the dust robertson - walker model of fig.[f3 ] , where the region shown in purple is a core of the larger red region @xmath1 .",
    "if the purple region is removed from the spacetime , then no closed f - trapped surface remains .",
    "this example demonstrates that cores are not unique : one can choose any other region @xmath308 equivalent to the chosen one by moving all its points by the group of symmetries on each homogeneous spatial slice of the robertson - walker metric .",
    "this kind of non - uniqueness is somehow irrelevant , being due to the existence of a high degree of symmetry . nevertheless , even in less symmetric cases the uniqueness of the cores",
    "can not be assumed beforehand , and one can actually prove that it does not hold in general , see proposition [ prop : ] below .    in spherically symmetric spacetimes ( with @xmath313 ) the region @xmath314 is a core of the f - trapped region .",
    "this follows firstly from the fact that removing @xmath308 from the spacetime short - circuits all possible closed f - trapped surfaces , as they can not be fully contained in the region where the kodama vector field is timelike ( the complement of @xmath308 ) as a consequence of lemma [ lemma ] . and secondly and more importantly , from theorem [ th : tiny ] , which implies that one can not remove a smaller region achieving the same goal .",
    "( this is where we need the condition of not having isolated - horizon portions in ah , but this is probably technical and the result will hold in general ) .",
    "the identified cores happen to be unique with spherical symmetry .    in spherically symmetric spacetimes ( with @xmath313 )",
    "@xmath315 are the only spherically symmetric cores of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , @xmath316 are the only spherically symmetric boundaries of a core .",
    "the two previous results are surprising and may have a deep meaning , because the trapped regions and their cores are global concepts , and in that sense they share the teleological and/or clairvoyant properties of eh and of trapped surfaces",
    ". however , we have identified at least one boundary of a core which happens to be a mtt and a very good one in spherical symmetry : the unique one respecting the symmetry , and mtts are quasi - local objects , they do not need to know future causes or to be aware of things that happen elsewhere .",
    "a full interpretation of this surprising result may lead to a better understanding of bhs and of their boundaries .",
    "it arises as an important problem the question of the uniqueness of cores , and their boundaries . as mentioned before",
    ", cores are not unique and one can prove the existence of non - spherically symmetric cores in spherically symmetric spacetimes@xcite .",
    "[ prop : ] there exist non - spherically symmetric cores of the f - trapped region in spherically symmetric spacetimes .    the proof of this result is essentially based on a theorem@xcite analogous to theorem [ th : ag ] but valid for general dhs ,",
    "because then one derives that there must be a subset of the future of any dynamical horizon which , when removed from the spacetime , gets rid of all closed f - trapped surfaces .",
    "however , as we do not have an analogous of theorem [ th : tiny ] for general dhs , it is unkown whether the core is a proper subset of , or the whole , future of the dh .",
    "therefore , only two things may happen .    1 .   for a generic mtt @xmath317 ,",
    "its causal future @xmath318 is a core .",
    "this will amount to saying that mtts are generically boundaries of cores for bhs .",
    "2 .   any mtt @xmath317 other than ah is such that its causal future @xmath318 is _",
    "not _ a core the core being a proper subset of @xmath318 . hence , the identified core @xmath315 is special in the sense that its boundary @xmath316 is a marginally trapped tube .",
