    "the form of the standard energy - momentum dispersion relation is fixed by the lorentz symmetry . even though the lorentz symmetry is one of the most important symmetries in nature ,",
    "there are indications from various approaches to quantum gravity that the lorentz symmetry might be violated in the ultraviolet limit @xcite-@xcite .",
    "thus , it is possible that the lorentz symmetry is only an effective symmetry which holds in the infrared limit of quantum gravitational processes .",
    "as the standard energy - momentum dispersion relation depends on the lorentz symmetry , it is expected that the standard energy - momentum dispersion relation will also get modified in the ultraviolet limit .",
    "in fact , it has been observed that such modification to the standard energy - momentum relation does occur in the discrete spacetime @xcite , models based on string field theory @xcite , spacetime foam @xcite , the spin - network in loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite , non - commutative geometry @xcite , and horava - lifshitz gravity @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the modification of the standard energy - momentum dispersion relation has motivated the development of double special relativity @xcite . in this theory ,",
    "apart from the velocity of light being the maximum velocity attainable , there is also a maximum energy scale in nature .",
    "this energy scale is the planck energy @xmath0 , and it is not possible to for a particle to attain energies beyond this energy . the double special relativity has been generalized to curved spacetime , and this doubly general theory of relativity is called gravity s rainbow @xcite . in this theory ,",
    "the geometry of spacetime depends on the energy of the test particle .",
    "so , particles of different energy see the geometry of spacetime differently .",
    "hence , the geometry of spacetime is represented by a family of energy dependent metrics forming a rainbow of metrics .",
    "this is the reason the theory has been called gravity s rainbow . in order to construct this theory ,",
    "the modified energy - momentum dispersion relation is written as @xmath1 where @xmath0 is the planck energy .",
    "the functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 are called rainbow functions , and they are required to satisfy @xmath4 this condition is needed , as the theory is constrained to reproduce the standard dispersion relation in the infrared limit . motivated by this energy dependent modification to the dispersion relation , the metric @xmath5 in gravity s rainbow",
    "is written as @xcite @xmath6 here the energy dependence of the frame fields can be written as @xmath7 where the tilde quantities refer to the energy independent frame fields .",
    "the energy at which the spacetime is probed is represented by @xmath8 , and the maximum attainable energy is represented by @xmath9 .",
    "so , if a text particle is used to probe the geometry of spacetime , then @xmath8 is the energy of that test particle .",
    "thus , by definition @xmath8 can not become greater than @xmath9 @xcite . as we will be applying gravity s rainbow to the black hole thermodynamics",
    ", the energy @xmath8 will correspond to the energy a quantum particle in the vicinity of the event horizon , which is emitted in the hawking radiation @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is possible to translate the uncertainty principle @xmath10 into a bound on energy @xmath11 @xcite . in gravity s rainbow , even though the metric depends on the energy , the usual uncertainty principle still holds @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the uncertainty in the position of the particle near the horizon should be equal to the radius of the event horizon radius @xcite-@xcite @xmath12 this energy @xmath8 of the particle in the vicinity of the event horizon will be used in the rainbow functions . it may be noted that this energy @xmath8 is a dynamical function of the radial coordinate @xcite .",
    "we will not need the explicit dependence of this energy on the radial coordinate , but it is important to note that the rainbow functions are dynamical , and so they can not be gauged away .",
    "furthermore , this energy of a particle near the horizon is bounded by the planck energy @xmath9 , and it can not increase to an arbitrary value .",
    "this bound on the energy also modifies the temperature of the black , and this modification to the temperature of the black hole can be used to calculate the corrections to the entropy of the black hole in gravity s rainbow @xcite .",
    "the modification of the thermodynamics of black rings in gravity s rainbow has also been calculated @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that the temperature of both the black holes and black rings starts to reduce after attaining a maximum value .",
    "thus , at a critical size the temperature of the black holes and black rings becomes zero . at this value",
    "the entropy also becomes zero .",
    "thus , the back hole stops radiating hawking radiation , after reaching this critical radius .",
    "thus , the gravity s rainbow predicts the existence of a black remnant .",
    "it has been argued that such a remnant will form for all black objects @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been explicitly demonstrated that such a remnant does form for kerr black holes , kerr - newman black holes in de sitter space , charged ads black holes , higher dimensional kerr - ads black holes and black saturn @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that the behavior of gravity s rainbow depends on the form of the rainbow functions chosen .",
    "the construction of these rainbow functions is motivated from various theoretical and phenomenological considerations . even though the form of these rainbow functions is different , the main property of these rainbow functions is that they make the geometry of spacetime dependent on the energy of the probe .",
    "this is the property which we will require in our analysis .",
    "so , in this paper , we will analyze the behavior of black hole solutions in the gauss - bonnet gravity s rainbow using these phenomenologically motivated rainbow functions .",
    "it may be noted that it is possible to add higher order curvature terms to the original lagrangian for general relativity . the theory obtained by adding quadratic powers of the curvature terms is called gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "it is also possible to construct a gauss - bonnet - maxwell gravity @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the lagrangian of gauss - bonnet - maxwell gravity can be written as @xmath13where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the riemann tensor and the cosmological constant , respectively . here",
    "@xmath16 denotes the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) coefficient , @xmath17 denotes the ricci scalar and @xmath18 denotes the ricci tensor . the last term in eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) is the maxwell invariant @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the electromagnetic field tensor and @xmath21 is the gauge potential .",
    "now the fields equations for the the gauss - bonnet - maxwell gravity lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) can be written as @xmath22where @xmath23here the the einstein tensor is denoted by @xmath24 and @xmath25 in gravity s rainbow the spacetime geometry depends on the energy of the probe ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "we can follow the methods used in the usual gravity s rainbow @xcite , and absorb all the energy dependence of the gauss - bonnet gravity s rainbow into the rainbow functions .",
    "so , we can write the energy dependent metric gauss - bonnet gravity s rainbow as @xmath26 where @xmath27 since we are looking for the black hole solutions with a radial electric field , we know that the nonzero components of the electromagnetic field are @xmath28 one can use eq .",

    "it is possible to obtain the hawking temperature by using the surface gravity , @xmath50    according to the area law , the entropy of black holes is equal to one - quarter of the horizon area .",
    "this relation is valid for einstein gravity , whereas we are not allowed to use it for higher derivative gravity . in this paper",
    "we investigate it in gauss - bonnet gravity s rainbow .",
    "we can use the wald formula for calculating the entropy @xmath51where @xmath52 is the ricci scalar for the induced metric @xmath53 on the @xmath54 dimensional boundary .",
    "we obtain @xmath55which confirms that the obtained black hole solutions violate the area law .",
    "we should mention that @xmath56 denotes the volume of @xmath57-dimensional sphere .",
    "considering the gauss law and calculating the flux of the electric field at infinity , one can find the electric charge of the black hole has the following form @xmath58 we can calculate the electric potential @xmath59 as @xmath60where @xmath61 is the null generator of the horizon .    in order to calculate the finite mass of the black hole we will use the adm ( arnowitt - deser - misner ) approach for large values of @xmath62 @xmath63 now using eqs .
