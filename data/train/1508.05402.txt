    "commensurate - incommensurate transitions are relevant to a number of condensed matter systems that can be effectively described as a lattice of particles interacting with an underlying periodic substrate .",
    "a commensurate state occurs when certain length scales of the particle lattice match the periodicity of the underlying substrate , such as when the number of particles is equal to the number of substrate minima @xcite .",
    "typically when commensurate conditions are met , the system forms an ordered state free of topological defects , while at incommensurate fillings there are several possibilities depending on the strength of the substrate .",
    "if the substrate potential is weak , the particles maintain their intrinsic lattice structure which floats on top of the substrate , while for strong substrates a portion of the particles lock into a configuration that is commensurate with the substrate while the remaining particles form excitations such as kinks , vacancies , or domain walls . at intermediate substrate strengths ,",
    "the lattice ordering can be preserved but there can be periodic distortions or rotations of the particle lattice with respect to the substrate lattice @xcite .",
    "these different cases are associated with differing dynamical responses of the particles under the application of an external drive @xcite .",
    "when kinks or domain walls are present , multi - step depinning process can occur when the kinks become mobile at a lower drive than the commensurate portions of the sample @xcite .",
    "examples of systems that exhibit commensurate - incommensurate phases include atoms adsorbed on atomic surfaces @xcite , vortices in type - ii superconductors interacting with artificial pinning arrays @xcite , vortex states in josephson - junction arrays @xcite , superfluid vortices in bose - einstein condensates in the presence of co - rotating optical trap arrays @xcite , cold atoms and ions on ordered substrates @xcite , and colloidal particles on periodic @xcite and quasi - periodic optical substrates @xcite .    in the superconducting vortex system , commensurability occurs when the number of vortices is an integer multiple of the number of pinning sites , and various types of commensurate vortex crystalline states can occur with different symmetries @xcite . at fillings where there are more vortices than pinning sites , it is possible to have multi - quantized vortices occupy the pinning sites , and a composite vortex lattice can form that is comprised of individual or multiple flux - quanta vortices localized on pinning sites coexisting with vortices located in the interstitial regions between the pinning sites @xcite . ordered commensurate vortex states have been directly imaged with lorentz microscopy @xcite and other imaging techniques @xcite , and the existence of commensuration can also be deduced from changes in the depinning force needed to move the vortices when peaks or steps appear in the critical current as a function of vortex density @xcite .",
    "it is also possible for ordered vortex structures such as checkerboard states to form at rational fractional commensuration ratios of @xmath0 with integer @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath2 is the number of vortices and @xmath1 is the number of pinning sites @xcite .",
    "experiments @xcite and simulations @xcite of colloidal assemblies on optical trap arrays examined the depinning transitions and subsequent sliding of the colloids and show that the depinning threshold is maximum for one - to - one matching of colloids and traps , while it drops at incommensurate fillings due to the presence of highly mobile kinks , anti - kinks , and domain walls .",

    "other vortex studies in similar samples also revealed peaks in the critical depinning force associated with commensuration effects @xcite , while studies of vortices interacting with 1d magnetic strips showed that commensurate conditions were marked by depinning steps rather than peaks @xcite . under an applied dc drive",

    "<S> we examine the statics and dynamics of vortices in the presence of a periodic quasi - one dimensional substrate , focusing on the limit where the vortex lattice constant is smaller than the substrate lattice period . as a function of the substrate strength and filling factor , within the pinned state we observe a series of order - disorder transitions associated with buckling phenomena in which the number of vortex rows that fit between neighboring substrate maxima increases . </S>",
    "<S> these transitions coincide with steps in the depinning threshold , jumps in the density of topological defects , and changes in the structure factor . at the buckling transition the vortices are disordered , while between the buckling transitions the vortices </S>",
    "<S> form a variety of crystalline and partially ordered states . in the weak substrate limit , </S>",
    "<S> the buckling transitions are absent and the vortices form an ordered hexagonal lattice that undergoes changes in its orientation with respect to the substrate as a function of vortex density . at intermediate substrate strengths , </S>",
    "<S> certain ordered states appear that are correlated with peaks in the depinning force . under an applied drive the system exhibits a rich variety of distinct dynamical phases , including plastic flow , a density - modulated moving crystal , and moving floating solid phases . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a dynamic smectic - to - smectic transition in which the smectic ordering changes from being aligned with the substrate to being aligned with the external drive . the different dynamical phases can be characterized using velocity histograms and the structure factor . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how these results are related to recent experiments on vortex ordering on quasi - one - dimensional periodic modulated substrates . </S>",
    "<S> our results should also be relevant for other types of systems such as ions , colloids , or wigner crystals interacting with periodic quasi - one - dimensional substrates . </S>"
