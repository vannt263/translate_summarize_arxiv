    "many quantum information protocols rely on single - photon states @xcite .",
    "a well known example is quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite .",
    "however , deterministic single - photon sources are still not readily available @xcite and probabilistic single - photon sources , such as heralded parametric down conversion , are inefficient and too complex and expensive to be practical in commercial devices . in consequence , many practical implementations of quantum information protocols use , instead of single - photon pulses , attenuated coherent state pulses that can be produced on demand .",
    "however , the use of weak coherent state ( wcs ) pulses carries its disadvantages . on one hand",
    "it is inefficient since most pulses carry no photon and , more importantly , it jeopardizes security since the probability for two or more photons is non - zero which allows for different forms of attack by an eavesdropper @xcite .",
    "+ the security issue of qkd with wcs has been solved through the decoy state method @xcite .",
    "in essence , alice , the sender , uses a random set of wcs of different amplitudes . on the receiving end",
    ", bob analyses the received data and is able , after communicating with alice , to detect the presence of a possible eavesdropper .",
    "more specifically , bob and alice are able to extract from the information obtained with wcs of different amplitudes , the yield through the communication channel of the single - photon states and compute the amount of information leaked to a possible eavesdropper @xcite .",
    "+ in a recent paper , yuan et al .",
    "@xcite have introduced a generalization of the decoy state method to the simulation of an arbitrary quantum process relying on single photon - states . in their article ,",
    "a detailed theoretical analysis is made for a process ending with a binary measurement outcome (  click \" or  no - click \" ) .",
    "the fact that coherent states can be used to characterize an arbitrary quantum process has been signalled in the past @xcite .",
    "however , as far as single - photon states are concerned , it results from @xcite that phase randomized coherent states ( prcs ) suffice for the process characterization .",
    "moreover , in this case , the estimation of the single - photon yield of the process can be obtained through simple linear algebra .",
    "+ in this article we present an experimental verification of the results of @xcite and their generalization to quantum processes resulting in a continuous variable outcome . specifically we demonstrate that the quantum tomography of a single - photon state of a temporal mode can be efficiently simulated with a small ensemble of prcs .",
    "the first experiments on quantum tomography of single - photon states were carried by lvovsky et al @xcite using heralded photons from parametric down - conversion .",
    "+ the temporal modes considered here are of constant amplitude during the finite time interval @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ns in the experiments described below ) .",
    "a stationary light beam can thus be viewed as many consecutive realizations of the field state in the temporal mode .",
    "more precisely , a well stabilized laser beam can be considered to a good approximation as the multiple realization of a coherent state @xmath2 .",
    "if the phase of the laser beam is varied at random between different realizations of the temporal mode , then the prepared state is a prcs with mean photon - number @xmath3 .",
    "+ following the usual quantum tomography sequence @xcite , we have initially determined an approximation to the field quadrature probability density ( marginal distribution ) of the single photon state . for this , the marginal distributions of several prcs were acquired and combined according to @xcite to derive an approximation to the marginal distribution of the single - photon state . in a second time , the approximate wigner function of the single - photon state and the corresponding density matrix was derived .",
    "our example shows that an excellent approximation is obtained even for a reduced number of mean photon - numbers values .",
    "the density matrix for a phase averaged coherent state of mean photon number @xmath4 is given by :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 designates a fock state with photon number @xmath7 and @xmath8    if a measurement is performed on the system in the state @xmath9 , the probability @xmath10 for an outcome @xmath11 is given by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the probability for an outcome @xmath11 when the system is prepared in the fock state @xmath6 .",
    "+ unlike in @xcite where expression ( [ x ] ) was applied to a binary measurement with two discrete outcomes (  click \" or  no - click \" ) , here we consider a measurement with a continuous variable outcome @xmath11 . in consequence , @xmath14 is the probability density for the measurement outcome to be in the range @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "notice that    [ xmu ] @xmath16    following @xcite , we introduce the notation @xmath17 .",
    "the values of @xmath4 and @xmath10 ( we drop the @xmath11 dependence for compactness ) can be experimentally determined . since @xmath18 is linearly related to the @xmath19 s via eq .",
    "( [ x ] ) , the knowledge of @xmath18 for a sufficiently large ensemble of values of @xmath4 should allow the approximate determination of the single - photon yield @xmath19 . following an analysis inspired on the decoy state method of qkd @xcite , yuan et",
    "al have derived several estimates for @xmath20 depending on the available values of the mean - photon - numbers @xmath4 @xcite . + keeping in mind the @xmath21 and @xmath10 refer here to continuous variable distributions , the results derived in @xcite concerning the estimate of @xmath20 remain valid .",
    "they are reminded next .",
    "if only the vacuum and a single value of @xmath4 are available , the estimate for @xmath20 is : @xmath22 which is an upper bound of @xmath20 ( see eq .",
    "( 15 ) in @xcite ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "when the information regarding the vacuum state ( @xmath23 ) and two or more values of @xmath24 is available the estimate of @xmath20 is given by : @xmath25 this estimate is an upper(lower ) bound for @xmath20 depending on @xmath26 being odd(even ) [ see eq .",
    "( 19 ) in @xcite ] .",
    "+ in this paper we illustrate the application of expressions ( [ y1 ] ) and ( [ yl ] ) to the determination of the probability density of the field quadrature @xmath27 for the single photon state @xmath28 . @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the usual photon annihilation and creation operators . since all states considered in this work have no definite phase , the probability distribution of @xmath31 is independent of @xmath32 , we will consequently drop the suffix .",
    "notice that with the above definition the variance of @xmath33 in the vacuum state ( or in a coherent state ) is @xmath34 .",
    "the expected probability distribution for the outcomes of @xmath33 for a phase averaged coherent state of mean photon - number @xmath4 is given by ( [ x ] ) where @xmath13 are the squares of the well known hermite - gauss eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator with @xmath7 excitations .",

    "the contrast in the inteference fringes between signal and lo is better than 98% . during data acquisition , in order to produce the phase randomization , a triangular voltage ramp is applied to the pzt with an amplitude corresponding to an approximately integer number of @xmath35 phase differences and a frequency near 100 hz .",
    "the difference of the two photodetector outputs , which is proportional the signal field quadrature , was monitored in a digital oscilloscope ( tektronix dpo4102b , 1 ghz bandwidth , maximum sampling rate : 5 gs / s ) .",
    "the balanced detector signal was sampled with a sampling frequency of 2.5 mhz .",
    "the recorded sample value corresponds to the average over the sampling interval of many scope internal acquisitions taken at the fastest scope sampling rate ( high resolution mode ) .",
    "this ensures that the amplitude of the sampled signal fluctuations scales as the inverse square - root of the interval duration .",
    "each sampling record consisted of @xmath36 samples . for each record , the mean value of the fluctuations was subtracted and a histogram of the fluctuations computed . the final histogram was the average over 100 similar sampling records .",
    "with the signal beam blocked , we checked that the variance of the quadrature fluctuations increases linearly with the lo power as expected for vacuum fluctuations .",
    "after acquisition , the experimental histograms were rescaled . from the histogram corresponding to the vacuum state , we computed the sample variance of the fluctuations .",
    "this can be achieved with high relative precision ( typically @xmath37 ) , given the large number of acquired data points .",
