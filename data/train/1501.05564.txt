    "the memristor is an electronic device predicted by l. chua in 1971@xcite and experimentally obtained a few years ago.@xcite these devices are characterized by distinct resistance states which could be used to store information as they show very fast switching and high retention times.@xcite    there are reports of a wide range of materials ( particularly metal oxides ) which show this memristive effect.@xcite although the switching mechanism , and the origin of the different resistance states has not been completely elucidated , it is generally believed that the presence of oxygen deficient phases plays a major role in the memristive effect.@xcite within the possible materials , tio@xmath2 is one of the most studied ones.@xcite inside memristive devices , ti@xmath0o@xmath1 channels immersed in the tio@xmath2-based matrix have been observed , and the formation of such structures is believed to be largely responsible for the change in resistivity.@xcite    while tio@xmath2 is known to be a wide gap semiconductor ( experimental band gap @xmath3 ev@xcite ) ti@xmath0o@xmath1 presents three phases with different electronic transport properties .",
    "the low temperature ( @xmath4 140 k ) and intermediate temperature phases ( 140 k @xmath5 150 k ) are semiconductors while the high temperature phase ( @xmath6 150 k ) is metallic.@xcite the differences between those phases is mainly due to small atomic displacements which do not lead to significant changes in the unit cell .    despite the large amount of theoretical work on either tio@xmath2 rutile @xcite and ti@xmath0o@xmath1,@xcite the band alignment of these two materials",
    "is not known up to now , mainly because of the difficulty in building a supercell containing the ti@xmath0o@xmath1-tio@xmath2 interface - the two materials present very different unit cells , making the match between them very difficult .",
    "this information could be very useful to the understanding of the atomic level mechanism of the memristor , given that the ti@xmath0o@xmath1-tio@xmath2 interface spans a great part of the device length after the formation of the conducting channels .",
    "as the total energy is given with respect to an arbitrary reference energy in periodic calculations , a common reference should be determined for all the structures involved in this work.@xcite in fact , the knowledge of this common reference is necessary to find the offset between the valence band of different materials .",
    "the knowledge of this band offset is important , for instance , in determining whether there is charge transfer at the interface between the two systems , the materials doping limits@xcite as well as other properties .",
    "for instance , scanlon _ _ et al.__@xcite determined the band offset between rutile and anatase tio@xmath2 structures via a cluster approach , providing an understanding about the separation of charge carriers in photocatalysis using the mixed - phase structure .",
    "our objective in this paper is to study the interface of tio@xmath2 and one of its oxygen deficient counterparts , ti@xmath0o@xmath1 . for this purpose",
    ", we built a supercell containing the ti@xmath0o@xmath1-tio@xmath2 interface which was then used for our calculations . in particular",
    "we analyze the band alignment , which has been found to be of type ii ( the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) is located in one material and valence band maximum ( vbm ) in the other ) , and its consequences to the overall electronic structure of the combined system .",
    "[ fig : struct - ti4o7 ]      [ fig : struct - tio2 ]      [ fig : struct - interface ]",
    "all density functional theory ( dft@xcite ) calculations in this work were performed using the vasp package.@xcite wave functions are described within the projector augmented waves ( paw ) scheme@xcite with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath8 electrons were considered as valence electrons for ti and o atoms respectively and the pbe functional@xcite was used as the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "the cutoff energy for the plane wave expansion was 700 ev and the k - point meshes used throughout this work were generated using a @xmath9 @xmath10-centered grid .",
    "spin polarization was taken into account for all calculations .",
    "relaxation of the ions was performed while the unit cell was kept fixed , until forces were smaller than @xmath11 ev /  , for the isolated materials and @xmath12 ev /  , for the supercell .",
    "we have performed test calculations with a smaller supercell for the interface , but with more strict parameters for the convergence of the forces .",
    "the results were similar for quantities calculated in this work .",
    "a hubbard @xmath13 parameter was introduced for a better description of the ti(d ) electrons .",
    "our earlier work @xcite shows that a value of 5 ev for @xmath13 is enough to achieve a good description of the electronic structure of ti@xmath14o@xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) magnli phases .",
    "even though , test calculations were performed for other values of @xmath13 ( 0 , 2 and 4 ev ) and the same qualitative results were obtained for the type of alignment as well as the relative position of the unnocupied levels of the same materials . in the rotationally invariant scheme as implemented in vasp@xcite only the value of @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the spherically averaged matrix element of the screened coulomb interaction between electrons ) is of relevance , thus @xmath18 was set to zero for all calculations .",
    "one of the key points in this work is that building the interface requires matching two of the three unit cell vectors of each compound at the interfacial region . for that to be accomplished , it is necessary to find the smallest supercell where the deformation imposed to each compound is such that no significant change in electronic structure with respect to the bulk material arises in regions away from the interface . for the materials presented in this work ,",
    "this is difficult , since the tio@xmath2 and the ti@xmath0o@xmath1 presented very distinct unit cells . the stable form of tio@xmath2 at ambient conditions is the rutile structure ( tetragonal unit cell , @xmath19 , @xmath20@xcite ) while the ti@xmath0o@xmath1 presents a complicated magnli structure ( triclinic cell , see table [ tab : struct ] ) .    *",

    "108.76 & 109.02 & 109.68 & 108.46 +    to overcome this difficulty , we followed steps that lead to the derivation of the magnli structure from the rutile one as follows .",
    "the first step is to obtain the magnli phase structures from tio@xmath2 rutile via the unit cell transformation@xcite @xmath28 & = & \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2n-1 \\end{array } \\right ] & \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } a_r \\\\ b_r \\\\ c_r \\end{array } \\right ] ,   \\end{array }   \\label{eq : transf}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the unit cell vectors of the magnli structure of index @xmath31 .",

    "[ fig : struct - tio2 ] and the comparison with the ti@xmath0o@xmath1 unit cell is presented in table [ tab : struct ] . notice that this still represents a tio@xmath2 rutile structure , but",
    "the unit cell is now the one from ti@xmath0o@xmath1 . from this point",
    ", the ti@xmath0o@xmath1 magnli phase , as well as all magnli phases ( ti@xmath14o@xmath15 , @xmath33 ) can be generated via the operation@xcite @xmath34 ,    \\label{eq : displ}\\ ] ] that consists of periodic displacements ; after every @xmath31-th ( 121 ) plane , the atoms are translated by @xmath35 $ ] crystal vector of the rutile unit cell .",
    "this operation leads to the formation of extended defects , which are composed of oxygen vacancies ( @xmath36 s ) restricted to planes known as shear planes .",
    "the resulting arrangement is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : struct - ti4o7 ] .",
    "since the operation given by equation [ eq : displ ] affects only the atomic positions , both structures present the same triclinic unit cell .",
    "in essence , the transformation presented above results in unit cells with equal lengths .",
    "the two materials can thus be interfaced in the plane that is secant to the @xmath23 axis ( highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig : struct - interface ] ) .",
    "this ti@xmath0o@xmath1-tio@xmath2 interface is , by construction , strain free , defect free , presents exactly the same cell parameters and consequently no dipoles would arise at the heterojunction . in our calculations we created a supercell along the @xmath23 axis by repeating the cell for each material four times ( @xmath37 ) in order to ensure convergence of the potential away from the interface .",
    "vector for all structures presented in this work : isolated tio@xmath2 and ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , and the interface . ]",
    "after obtaining the three structures - both isolated materials and their interface - it is possible to calculate the natural band offset between the two systems studied in this work .",
    "the band offset will be given by @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the differences between the valence band maximum energy ( @xmath41 ) and the electrostatic potential averaged over a certain volume of the unit cell of the isolated materials , while @xmath42 is the difference between the averaged electrostatic potential of the different materials calculated in bulk - like regions of the relaxed heterostructure supercell .",
    "the determination of the quantities needed by equation [ eq : band - offset ] can be achieved by , first , obtaining the electronic structure of each isolated ( bulk ) system . from this calculation ,",
    "the average electrostatic potential along the crystal axis which is secant to the interface ( the @xmath23 axis , in this case ) is determined , @xmath43 as well as the position in energy of the vbm , @xmath41 for each system . using the heterostructure after ionic relaxation we also calculated @xmath44 in a similar fashion . from the plot of the electrostatic potential for all three structures ( shown in figure [ fig : potential ] ) it is possible to define regions , labeled @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where both the bulk materials and the heterostructure present similar characteristics .",
    "these regions of the heterostructure are considered as bulk - like and should have , in principle , the same potential .",
    "the average electrostatic potential is then obtained by the integration of @xmath44 along @xmath45 and @xmath46 for ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and tio@xmath2 respectively , and is used to calculate the first and second terms of equation [ eq : band - offset ] . from the heterostructure calculation , the same quantities are used to obtain the final term .",
    "the third step would comprise the determination of the band energy shift due to the hydrostatic pressure . in this particular case",
    "our heterostructure is completely strain free , as it is built by equal unit cells , thus this last step presents no contribution . after those steps were carried out , the band offset obtained in our case resulted in @xmath47 ev .",
    "numerical errors due to the choice of a particular @xmath13 were estimated to be @xmath48 0.3 ev , by comparison with other test calculations performed using other values of @xmath13 .",
    "even though the value of the valence band offset presented a variation with respect to the value of @xmath13 used , being smaller for smaller @xmath13 , the overall electronic structure of the interface has not changed , and the final result , which is the relative position of electronic levels of tio@xmath2 and ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , remained practically unchanged .",
    "for this reason , we have chosen to report only the results for @xmath13 = 5 ev .",
    "the projected density of states ( pdos ) was calculated for the two isolated structures and the results were shifted in energy by the band offset .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdos ] . from that graph , it is possible to notice that the vbm of the interface is located on ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , while the cbm is found in the tio@xmath2 , resulting in a type ii heterostructure .",
    "rutile and ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "gray shaded areas denote the occupied levels ( below @xmath49 , which is highlighted by the dotted vertical lines ) and the two spin components are pictured by positive and negative values along the vertical axis .",
    "the upper panel shows the band alignment between the two materials . ]",
    "given that the cbm is 0.16 ev above the vbm ( upper panel , fig .",
    "[ fig : pdos ] ) , it is possible that electrons would leave the ti@xmath0o@xmath1 structure and arrive at the unoccupied levels at the tio@xmath2 structure due to the presence of an electric field . in this case , the ti@xmath0o@xmath1 channels present inside of the tio@xmath2 matrix that forms the memristor could act as donors to the neighboring region of that matrix .",
    "this specific characteristic does not depend on the choice of @xmath13 . while it is known that the isolated oxygen vacancy in the tio@xmath2 rutile acts as a shallow donor,@xcite as to our knowledge , this same behavior has not been reported for the ordered defects present into the ti@xmath0o@xmath1 structure .",
    "o@xmath1-tio@xmath2 interface after ionic relaxation .",
    "the blue plane points out the interface region of the structure , being composed of ti@xmath0o@xmath1 to the left and tio@xmath2 to the right of the line.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig : cbm ]     o@xmath1-tio@xmath2 interface after ionic relaxation .",
    "the blue plane points out the interface region of the structure , being composed of ti@xmath0o@xmath1 to the left and tio@xmath2 to the right of the line.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig : vbm ]    further evidence of the real - space separation of the vbm and cbm is given by the projected charge density over the frontier orbitals .",
    "the projection was performed for the last occupied and first unoccupied bands , at the @xmath10 point . as a result , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : parchg ] , it is possible to notice that while the vbm ( fig [ fig : vbm ] ) is located mainly on the ti atoms of the ti@xmath0o@xmath1 structure close to the interface ( with a contribution of some of the ti atoms from tio@xmath2 ) , the cbm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cbm ] ) is located exclusively on the tio@xmath2 segment .",
    "some hybridization may be responsible for the contribution coming from the tio@xmath2 structure to the vbm , as both levels present ti(d ) character ( see fig [ fig : pdos ] ) .",
    "another explanation for this contribution would be the length of the @xmath23 axis , which is not long enough to describe the separation of the frontier orbitals .",
    "indeed , calculations performed with a smaller supercell ( the supercell @xmath23 vector length was half of the one used in the calculations presented ) resulted in larger charge delocalization . therefore , we expect that , in the limit of longer unit cells ( closer to realistic systems ) the charge would be fully separated on the two phases .",
    "in conclusion , we have reported the band offset given by the average of the electrostatic potential for the ti@xmath0o@xmath1-tio@xmath2 heterostructure .",
    "the supercell containing the junction was built using transformations that resulted in the same unit cell for both materials present on this junction .",
    "the localization of the vbm and cbm was determined to be at the ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and tio@xmath2 structures respectively , resulting in a type ii heterostructure .",
    "as the band gap is 0.16 ev , our results indicate that the ti@xmath0o@xmath1 channels inside of the memristor tio@xmath2 matrix would then act as donors for the tio@xmath2 structure .",
