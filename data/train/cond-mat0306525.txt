    "the magnetophoresis problems is a member of the class of reptation problems in which a long polymer is driven through a gel .",
    "the reptative motion of the polymer can be succesfully modeled by a lattice version using sections of the polymer ( the reptons ) as the mobile units , which hop stochastically from cell to cell .",
    "the driving field is incorporated as a bias in the hopping rates , favoring the motion in the field direction .",
    "a simple and adequate model is the rubistein - duke model @xcite , which represents the polymer as a chain of @xmath0 independently moving reptons , with the restriction that the integrity of the chain is preserved .",
    "the reptons trace out a connected string of cells in space , each cell containing at least one repton .",
    "the cells , which can be multiply occupied , carry the extra reptons as units of stored length . in order to preserve the integrity of the chain , only those reptons which are located in cells with stored length can hop .",
    "usually one considers the case of polyelectrolytes in which the reptons are uniformly charged .",
    "thus the driving field pulls equally on all reptons and the bias is the same for the hopping rates all along the chain .",
    "a practical situation where this occurs is in dna electrophoresis @xcite .",
    "the dna molecules , being acid , get charged in solution and when they are placed in a gel subject to an external electric field they perform a biased reptative motion along the field direction .",
    "electrophoresis is a technique of great importance in molecular biology and sequence analysis , as it allows to separate dna strands according to their length @xcite .    in nature",
    "the charge distribution is of course not always uniform .",
    "the extreme alternative is the case where all reptons are neutral except one end repton , which is charged .",
    "a possible realization of such a situation is a magnetic bead , attached at one end of the polymer , which is driven by a magnetic field .",
    "therefore this case can be referred to as the magnetophoresis ( mp ) problem @xcite .",
    "it is the subject of this paper . as we will frequently compare our findings with the more common case of the uniformly charged polymer",
    ", we will , for briefness , refer to the latter as the electrophoresis ( ep ) problem and to the present one as the mp problem , although the distinction between the two is not electromagnetic , but only in the forces exerted on the reptons ( see fig . [ rd ] ) .",
    "reptons is given by a set of @xmath1 integers @xmath2 measuring the distance of two neighboring reptons along the field direction ( thus @xmath3 ) .",
    "for the two examples shown the coordinates are @xmath4 for ( a ) and @xmath5 for ( b ) .",
    ", width=309 ]    the mp problem , within the framework of the rubinstein  duke model , has so far been studied by means of monte carlo simulations @xcite , and the calculations were mostly restricted to the drift velocity as function of the applied field and chain length . in this paper",
    "we analyze the mp problem by means of density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) techniques , which allow us to perform a detailed analysis of both global quantities as drift and curvilinear velocities and diffusion coefficient , but also on local average shapes of the polymer .",
    "the dynamics of the reptating chain is governed by the master equation which we put in the form @xmath6 here @xmath7 stands for the set of links @xmath8 , where @xmath9 measures the distance between the repton @xmath10 and @xmath11 , along the direction of the applied field . in our lattice representation",
    "the @xmath9 can take the values @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the value @xmath14 corresponds to the case that the reptons @xmath10 and @xmath11 occupy the same cell .",
    "thus each zero is a unit of stored length .",
    "the non  zero values represent the cases where @xmath11 occupies a cell `` higher '' ( 1 ) or `` lower '' ( -1 ) than @xmath10 .",
    "higher and lower refer to a position in the direction of the field .",
    "@xmath7 represents a complete configuration of the chain ( see fig .",
    "@xmath15 is the probability distribution of the configuration at time @xmath16 and the matrix @xmath17 contains the gain and loss transitions from @xmath18 to @xmath7 .",
    "the bias in the hopping rate is contained in the matrix elements of @xmath19 .",
    "generally we have for the bias factor @xmath20 with @xmath21 the charge of repton @xmath10 , @xmath22 the driving field , @xmath23 the distance between adjacent cells ( measured along the field direction ) and @xmath24 the standard combination of boltzmann s constant and the absolute temperature . in the mp problem",
    "all @xmath25 except for @xmath26 .",
    "we put @xmath27 and use @xmath28 as the parameter for the driving field .",
    "the other parameter of the model is the number of reptons n.    we have chosen this `` hamiltonian form '' of the master equation in order to stress the formal correspondence with a quantum mechanical model governed by a hamiltonian matrix .",
    "the dmrg method exploits this analogy and indeed its success in one - dimensional quantum problems carries over to reptation problems @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the stationary state of the probability distribution . in the quantum language",
    "this corresponds to finding the right eigenvector of @xmath19 belonging to the eigenvalue zero .",
    "the adaptation of the dmrg method to the mp problem is straightforward and the data presented in this paper are obtained by the dmrg method . an important difference with the master equation is that in quantum mechanical problems the hamiltonian is hermitian , whereas in the reptation problem the matrix @xmath19 is non  hermitian , due to the influence of the driving field .",
    "this restricts the applicability of the dmrg  method to moderately long chains and/or small driving fields .",
    "the physics of the ep and mp problems is qualitatively different . as illustration",
    "consider the weak field case ( @xmath28 small ) , where the nernst ",
    "einstein relation @xmath29 relates the drift velocity @xmath30 to the total applied force @xmath31 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath32 .",
    "the force @xmath31 , equals @xmath33 in the ep case , since one pulls at each repton .",
    "it is well known that @xmath30 scales as @xmath34 , yielding for the diffusion the non  trivial result @xmath35 . in the mp problem",
    "@xmath32 will be essentially the same , as hopping is limited by the availability of stored length . in both cases",
    "the motion can be considered as diffusion of stored length . since @xmath36 in the mp problem",
    ", we expect the drift velocity to scale as @xmath37 , a feature which is born out by our calculations .    in the sec .",
    "[ sec : moments ] we discuss some moment equations derived from the master equation which are more helpful then in the ep problem in analyzing the drift and curvilinear velocity .",
    "they are expressed in terms of the probabilities @xmath38 that the link @xmath10 has the value @xmath39 .",
    "the sum of the @xmath38 adds up to 1 @xmath40 so it suffices to consider the two quantities @xmath41 and @xmath42 defined by @xmath43 @xmath41 can be called the local density of stored length .",
    "@xmath42 is a measure for the local orientation and will be referred to as the profile of the chain .    in the sections [ sec : global ] and [ sec : profiles ] we present our data for the velocities and the profiles .",
    "the analysis is most transparent in the strong field limit where we can make an ansatz which almost perfectly represents the data . in section [ sec : profiles ] we discuss the behavior of the profile for weak and strong pulling fields .",
    "the dmrg method deals with the whole probability distribution @xmath44 . in the mp problem",
    "it is fruitful to consider moments of the master equation .",
    "one set of moments is obtained by multiplying eq .",
    "( [ aa1 ] ) with @xmath9 and then summing over all @xmath7 .",
    "this leads to @xmath1 relations which can be seen as an expression of the fact that the drift velocity @xmath30 across all the @xmath1 links of the chain must be the same on the average .",
    "an even more useful set of relations is obtained by multiplying the master equation by @xmath45 and summing over all @xmath46 .",
    "the resulting @xmath1 relations are an expression of the fact that the curvilinear velocity @xmath47 is the same across all links .",
    "these relations obtain the form @xmath48 which can be viewed as the familiar law that the current @xmath47 equals minus the gradient of the density of the stored length .",
    "in addition to eq .",
    "( [ bb1 ] ) one has two relations @xcite concerning the traffic in and out both ends of the chain .",
    "they read @xmath49    the expression for the drift velocity involves correlations between neighboring links @xmath50 and it is therefore not as informative as eq .",
    "( [ bb1 ] ) . as one sees eq .",
    "( [ bb2 ] ) involves only averages over the first ( last ) link .",
    "this holds also for the expressions for the drift velocity in terms of the averages of the first and last link .",
    "these equations have been derived by barkema and schtz @xcite using balance arguments .",
    "equation ( [ bb1 ] ) is a powerful relation since it allows to express the density of stored length in terms of the curvilinear velocity @xmath52 showing that the density profile is linear in the position of the cell . in particular ( [ bb5 ] ) implies a relation between the densities of the first and last cell @xmath53 we have used the linearity of the density @xmath41 as a check of the numerical calculations .    counting the number of unknowns ( @xmath30 , @xmath47 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) and the number of equations ( [ bb2 ] ) , ( [ bb4 ] ) and ( [ bb6 ] ) we see that we have one more unknown than equations",
    "this situation is similar to the ep problem .",
    "there the expression for the curvilinear velocity does not obtain the simple form ( [ bb1 ] ) , due to the bias on the internal reptons . so one misses relation ( [ bb6 ] ) . on the other hand @xmath58 for ep , due to the symmetry of the polymer on exchanging head and tail .",
    "thus in both cases the moment equations are not sufficient to determine the velocities .",
    "higher moments do not lead to additional information since again higher order correlations appear .",
    "we discuss first the behavior of global quantities as the drift and curvilinear velocities and the diffusion constant .      in the weak field limit",
    "the polymer assumes mostly a random configuration and all the densities @xmath38 are close to 1/3 .",
    "the overal behavior of the drift velocity @xmath30 as function of @xmath28 and @xmath0 is given in fig .",

    "the advantage of calculating @xmath60 with a small field acting only on an end repton is that the dmrg procedure is much more stable in this case and one can compute longer chains .",

    "<S> the profiles , which describe the average shape of the reptating chain , also show interesting features as some non - monotonic behavior of the links densities for sufficiently strong pulling fields . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a description in which a distinction is made between links entering at the pulled head and at the unpulled tail . at weak fields the separation between the head zone and the tail zone meanders through the whole chain , while the probability of finding it close to the edges drops off . at strong fields </S>",
    "<S> the tail zone is confined to a small region close to the unpulled edge of the polymer . </S>"
