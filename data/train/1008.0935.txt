    "the problem of calculating the gravitational self - force ( gsf ) acting on a pointlike particle of mass @xmath1 , in bound orbit around a schwarzschild black hole ( of a much larger mass @xmath11 ) , is now well understood at leading order in the small mass ratio @xmath12 ( see @xcite for reviews of recent developments ) .",
    "explicit numerical computations of the gsf , specialized to circular orbits , were carried out by at least three different groups using a variety of methods @xcite .",
    "these calculations all rely on mode - sum regularization @xcite but are otherwise based on very different computational strategies which are formulated in different gauges .",
    "two of us recently reported a numerical code for computing the gsf along generic ( bound ) geodesics with arbitrary eccentricities @xcite .    in principle ,",
    "knowledge of the gsf ( along with the metric perturbation associated with the particle ) gives a complete information about the @xmath13 post - geodesic dynamics of the binary system .",
    "however , the gsf itself is a gauge - dependent notion @xcite , and it is generally not a straightforward task to translate the raw gsf data ( i.e. , the value of the various components of the gsf along the orbit , computed in a given gauge ) into physically meaningful gauge - invariant statements about the orbital dynamics .",
    "it is particularly non - trivial to obtain such a gauge - invariant description for the _ conservative _ part of the dynamics , which is also ( in principle ) accessible from the gsf . for circular orbits ,",
    "detweiler @xcite proposed to measure the conservative effect of the gsf using the gauge - invariant relation between the `` red - shift '' parameter @xmath14 ( the schwarzschild-@xmath15 contravariant component of the four - velocity along the circular geodesic ) and the azimuthal frequency @xmath16 . using numerical data for the gsf in the regge - wheeler gauge , detweiler was able to compute the relation @xmath17 through @xmath13 .",
    "numerical computations of the gsf in the lorenz - gauge and in the radiation gauge were later shown to reproduce the same relation @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the recent development of a gsf code for eccentric orbits ( formulated in the lorenz gauge ) enabled the computation of additional gauge invariant quantities associated with the conservative effect of the gsf . by considering slightly - eccentric orbits ,",
    "two of the authors have computed the @xmath13 conservative shift in the orbital frequency of the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) @xcite .",
    "this quantity ( unlike @xmath14 ) has a clear physical interpretation , and , at least in principle , a measurable effect on the signature of gravitational waves from the binary system .",
    "most recently , the gsf correction to the precession rate of orbits with arbitrary eccentricities has also been calculated @xcite .",
    "analyzing the gauge - invariant effects of the gsf allows one not only to compare between gsf calculations carried out in different gauges , but also to make an important connection with the well - established post - newtonian ( pn ) theory .",
    "indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite detweiler used the relation @xmath18 to demonstrate , for the first time , that conservative gsf results ( for circular orbits ) were consistent with the analytic predictions of pn theory .",
    "this comparison was further improved , and pushed to higher pn orders , in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .    such `` cross - cultural '' comparisons ( to use the language of ref .",
    "@xcite ) are motivated in several ways .",
    "( i ) they provide highly non - trivial opportunities to confirm some of the basic aspects of both gsf and pn formalisms ( such as the regularization procedures underpinning them ) .",
    "( ii ) comparison of concrete results from gsf and pn computations serves to test both sets of results ; such two - way validation tests are crucial given the complexity of both gsf numerical codes and pn analytic computations .",
    "( iii ) results from gsf calculations can inform the development of accurate analytical relativity ( ar ) models by providing high - accuracy calibration data for yet - unknown high - order pn terms .",
    "combined also with numerical relativity ( nr ) results for comparable - mass binaries , one eventually hopes to develop a reliable and accurate ar model across the full range of binary mass ratios ( e.g. , for gravitational - wave detection applications ) .",
    "within such a program , gsf calculations provide a crucial `` data point '' at the extreme edge ( extreme mass ratio , small separation ) of the essential parameter space of the binary problem .",
    "( iv ) since pn theory is formulated for arbitrary mass ratios , it could be used to test second-(and higher-)order gsf computations when these become available in the future .    a fundamental challenge in any gsf ",
    "pn comparison arises from the fact that the two methods are designed to explore distinct regimes of the binary problem : gsf methods work best for strong - field orbits ( the necessary computational resources tend to increase fast with the orbital radius @xcite ) , while the standard pn series is essentially an asymptotic expansion about the limit of infinite binary separation ",
    "although it performs surprisingly well at rather small separations , it ultimately fails to converge at sufficiently small radii .",
    "the upshot is that , in order to facilitate a useful gsf  pn synergy , one must ( generally speaking ) stretch gsf techniques beyond their natural domain of applicability ( i.e. , obtain large - radius data ) while at the same time attempt to compute new higher - order terms in the pn series , at least through @xmath13 . that this can be achieved in practice was indeed demonstrated by blanchet _",
    "et al . _  in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "although pn theory is the basis of most of our current analytical knowledge of the motion and radiation of gravitationally interacting comparable - mass binary systems , it is unable , by itself , to provide an analytical description of the entire evolution of such systems . indeed , the pn description is only accurate during the early inspiral and it breaks down during the late inspiral , well before the merger . the effective one body ( eob ) formalism @xcite was proposed as a flexible ar framework for describing the motion and radiation of coalescing binaries over the entire merger process , from the early inspiral , right across the innermost stable orbit , through the ` plunge ' and to the merger and final ringdown .    at the heart of the eob formulation",
    "is an `` effective hamiltonian '' which depends on 3 initially - unspecified functions : @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . here",
    "@xmath22 is the dimensionless gravitational potential ( with @xmath23 being the eob measure of the binary separation ) , @xmath24 is the symmetric mass ratio , and @xmath25 is the eob ( relative ) radial momentum .",
    "pn theory gives access to the expansions of these functions in powers of the variable @xmath26 .",
    "these `` taylor - expanded '' functions were found to behave badly ( at the 3pn level ) in the strong - field region @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "it was then suggested to replace them with suitably _",
    "resummed _ expressions ( pad approximants ) .",
    "the natural analytical flexibility of the eob formalism leads one to consider resummed functions , especially @xmath19 , which include yet uncalculated coefficients , @xmath28 parametrizing pn terms beyond the currently known 3pn level .",
    "these a priori unknown coefficients can then be `` calibrated '' by comparing eob predictions to numerical data from nr simulations @xcite .",
    "vigorous ongoing activity in this area is convincingly demonstrating the utility of the eob framework to describe accurately all phases of the merger process of comparable - mass binaries , from the early inspiral to the final ringdown .",
    "moreover , eob theory has been shown to perform very well also in the extreme mass ratio regime @xcite .",
    "the recent gsf results provide a new source of calibration data for the eob model .",
    "the gsf data have the potential to be particularly useful for this purpose , for a number of reasons .",
    "( i ) unlike most available nr data , gsf data is `` clean '' and very accurate ",
    "the numerical component in gsf calculations only involves _ linear _ differential equations .",
    "( ii ) in gsf calculations , again unlike in nr , it is straightforward to disentangle the conservative aspects of the dynamics from the dissipative ones ( eob treats these two aspects separately ) .",
    "( iii ) gsf data `` fill the gap '' in the strong - field / extreme - mass - ratio corner of the parameter space , which ( as of yet ) is inaccessible to either pn or nr .",
    "( iv ) gsf calculations already return accurate data for orbits with large eccentricities ; this data could give a good handle on the two eob functions ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) which describe the radial component of the motion and have not been studied in detail so far . on the other hand ,",
    "the gsf data have the shortcoming of only giving access to the @xmath31 terms in the @xmath32-expansions of the eob functions @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the prospect for a useful gsf ",
    "eob synergy was recently highlighted in a paper by one of us @xcite .",
    "this work explored how the single gsf data point obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite [ namely , the @xmath13 conservative shift in the isco frequency ] constrains the shape around @xmath33 of the @xmath31 term in the crucial eob radial potential @xmath19 , and thereby can improve the determination of two higher - order parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which previous eob ",
    "nr analysis had found to be strongly degenerate .",
    "@xcite also identified several additional gauge - invariant quantities that might be computable using current gsf technology , and could provide useful additional calibration data for eob .    in this work",
    "we consider one of the gauge - invariant quantities proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely the _ conservative gsf correction to the periastron precession for slightly eccentric orbits_. more precisely , we consider the related quantity @xmath3 , defined as the @xmath13 conservative part of the squared ratio of the radial and azimuthal frequencies [ see eq .",
    "( [ wexp ] ) below ] , with @xmath8 being the dimensionless gravitational potential defined from the invariant azimuthal frequency .",
    "the function @xmath3 is a truly dynamical gauge - invariant characteristic of the conservative dynamics , in that , as shown in @xcite , its knowledge gives a direct handle on the strong - field behavior of [ the @xmath31 part of ] a combination of the eob functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the gsf computation of the function @xmath3 in the interval @xmath7 , which we present here , is therefore the first determination of the _ strong - field behavior _ of a combination of functions which are of direct significance for describing the conservative dynamics of binary systems . , but this function can not , as far as we know , be used to inform the ar description of the dynamics of binary systems . ] as such it can contribute to the development of accurate ar models of the gravitational wave signals emitted by coalescing binaries .",
    "the _ weak - field _ behavior of @xmath3 , on the other hand , has already been analyzed @xcite through 3pn order [ @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , the logarithmic contributions present at the 4pn and 5pn levels ( @xmath37 ) have been recently determined analytically @xcite .",
    "[ the presence of logarithmic contributions in the ( near - zone ) pn expansions , starting at the 4pn level , follows from old work @xcite .",
    "the importance and detectability of these logarithmic terms in the comparison between gsf data and pn expansions has been recently discussed in refs .",
    "] here we shall use the numerical methods of refs .",
    "@xcite to obtain corresponding gsf data for @xmath3 , both in the strong - field region ( @xmath38 ) and in the weak field ( @xmath39 ) , and explore what can be learned by comparing the gsf results with the eob / pn expressions .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the next section",
    "we derive an expression for the function @xmath3 in terms of gsf quantities , and review the eob expression for @xmath3 . in sec .",
    "iii we describe the numerical method applied to obtain the necessary gsf data , and present our numerical results for @xmath3 . in sec .",
    "iv we test the numerical data against the currently available eob / pn results , and in sec .  v we examine to what extent the gsf data can be used to determine yet - unknown higher - order pn terms in the eob model .",
    "section vi explores the utility of simple pad models ( i.e. , rational - function fits ) , based on a minimal amount of eob and gsf information , to provide accurate global fits for @xmath3 .",
    "section vii contains a summary and a discussion of future directions for eob ",
    "gsf synergy .    throughout this paper",
    "we use standard geometrized units ( with @xmath40 ) , metric signature @xmath41 , and schwarzschild coordinates @xmath42 .",
    "we consider a gravitationally - bound binary comprising a particle of mass @xmath1 and a schwarzschild black hole of a much greater mass , @xmath2 .",
    "we denote the small mass ratio by @xmath43 , and throughout our analysis work through @xmath13 only .",
    "readers should be wary of the conflict between the standard pn / eob notation and the common gsf one ( see table [ table : masses ] ) ; our notation here represents a compromise between the two sets of notations .",
    "note that the symmetric mass ratio . ]",
    "is @xmath44 , so that an @xmath13 quantity is also @xmath31 .",
    "one should , however , beware of the important @xmath13 difference between the large mass @xmath11 ( which is often used in gsf works to adimensionalize frequencies , and denoted there @xmath45 ) and the total mass @xmath46 ( which is used in pn / eob works to adimensionalize frequencies , and denoted there @xmath45 as well ) .",
    ".our notation for various mass quantities , compared with the common gsf notation and with the standard pn or eob notation .",
    "readers should be wary of these notation differences , which can bring confusion . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the above experiments illustrate an important point : it is possible to obtain an accurate global model for @xmath3 using the available pn expression in conjunction with just a handful of near - isco gsf data points ; a pad approximant based solely on this information can faithfully `` bridge '' over the entire @xmath8 domain where stable circular orbits exist .",
    "this may hold true for other quantities that characterize the @xmath31 dynamics , in which case one has a ( relatively ) computationally cheap way of modelling such quantities , which does not require an exhaustive gsf survey of the @xmath8 domain .",
    "of course , in each case one must have at hand some gsf data at intermediate radii in order to be able to confidently assess the faithfulness of one s pad model .",
    "the following general scheme suggests itself : ( 1 ) construct a pad model ( or a set of models ) based on all available pn information and on a handful of readily computable strong - field gsf data points ; ( 2 ) compute the gsf for a small , complementary sample of intermediate @xmath8 values and use these data points to assess the performance of the pad model(s ) .",
    "this scheme could save the need to obtain a dense sample of gsf data across the entire @xmath8 domain ( as we have done in sec .",
    "iii of this work ) .",
    "furthermore , in this procedure the `` verification '' gsf data ( which may be most computationally expensive ) need not be very accurate as in our present work  their accuracy should only match one s error tolerance .",
    "the fits we just presented for the function @xmath3 were mainly given to illustrate a general strategy for an efficient synergy between gsf , pn and eob theories . in ref .",
    "@xcite one of us proposed several other gauge - invariant quantities that may be accessible to both eob / pn and gsf treatments and that could be used to further constrain the eob functions at @xmath31 .",
    "in particular , it was proposed to utilize two gauge - invariant quantities defined for a _ marginally - bound `` zoom - whirl '' orbit _ , namely the gsf - corrected values of the azimuthal `` whirl '' frequency and of the total ( dimensionless ) orbital angular momentum .",
    "it was shown that these two quantities uniquely determine the values of the crucial @xmath31 eob radial potential @xmath47 , and of its @xmath8-derivative , at the strong - field point @xmath48 , i.e. , significantly beyond the isco .",
    "this would allow us to extend our strong - field knowledge beyond the interval @xmath49 that our present study has been limited to .",
    "most importantly , the application of our general strategy to the function @xmath47 might give us a good handle on the shape of @xmath47 in the very - strong - field regime .",
    "indeed , by combining the current pn knowledge of @xmath47 near the weak - field point @xmath9 ( i.e. , the information that @xmath50 , together with the non - zero values of the two numbers @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) with the hopefully obtainable gsf knowledge of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we might obtain an accurate global representation of the function @xmath47 in the entire interval @xmath55 .",
    "this would be a most valuable information for the eob formalism .",
    "then , combining this global knowledge of the function @xmath47 with the direct gsf knowledge of the function @xmath3 obtained here , we could further derive the global shape of the function @xmath56 ( at least in the interval @xmath49 ) .",
    "we presented here a calculation of the gsf correction to the precession rate of the orbital periastron for a particle of mass @xmath1 in a slightly eccentric orbit around a schwarzschild black hole of mass @xmath57 .",
    "our calculation is _ exact _ at first order in the mass ratio @xmath12 ( within a controlled numerical error of @xmath58 fractionally ) .",
    "our first main result was the computation of a dimensionless measure of the @xmath13 contribution to periastron advance , @xmath4 , as a function of the dimensionless azimuthal - frequency parameter @xmath6^{2/3}$ ] .",
    "we computed the function @xmath3 for a dense sample of @xmath8-values in the interval @xmath7 corresponding to a sequence of stable circular orbits ( down to the isco , located at @xmath10 ) .",
    "the bulk of this paper concerned itself with a comparison of the gsf results with pn predictions formulated via the eob formalism , and we explored what can be learned from such a comparison .",
    "we demonstrated three main goals that can be achieved by combining gsf and eob / pn results : ( i ) test the gsf computation and confirm the eob / pn results ( and , indirectly , also reaffirm the regularization procedures underpinning both gsf and pn theories ) ; ( ii ) calibrate yet - unknown high - order parameters in the eob / pn expansion ; and ( iii ) engineer a faithful global model for the dynamical quantity in question , which is valid both in the weak field and in the strong field , and anywhere in between .",
    "the new quantitative results of this work are ( i ) the @xmath13 periastron - advance function @xmath3 ( tabulated in table [ table : data ] and plotted in figure [ fig : rho ] ) , ( ii ) an estimate of the @xmath13 parts of a few unknown pn parameters [ summarized in eq .",
    "( [ calibrated ] ) ] , and ( iii ) an approximate analytic formula for @xmath3 [ given in eq .",
    "( [ pade2pt ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ 2ptvalues ] ) ; alternative , more accurate , analytic models for @xmath3 are described in table [ table : pade ] ] .",
    "in addition , we have provided numerical confirmations of several analytically determined pn / eob parameters , namely the following pn expansion coefficients of @xmath3 : the 2pn coefficient @xmath59 , the 3pn coefficient @xmath60 , and the recently computed logarithmic 4pn and 5pn coefficients @xmath61 and @xmath62 @xcite , whose knowledge was quite crucial for determining the 4pn and 5pn non - logarithmic contributions .    our best estimates for the unknown ( non - logarithmic ) 4pn and 5pn parameters ( let alone the 6pn parameter ) are rather crude  see the large error bars in eq .",
    "( [ calibrated ] ) . at fault",
    "are two main factors .",
    "first , the construction of @xmath3 from the various gsf components , prescribed in eq .",
    "( [ rhosfpn ] ) , involves a delicate cancellation of the two dominant terms in the @xmath8 expansion around @xmath9 , namely the @xmath63 term and the @xmath64 term , leaving a final @xmath3 of @xmath65 ; we found analytically that @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which are both @xmath68 , cancel in the leading @xmath63 term , while the cancellations occurring in the next ( 1pn ) @xmath64 term involve @xmath69 together with the sub - leading , 1pn corrections to @xmath70 and @xmath67 .",
    "these cancellations effectively amplify ( in relative terms ) the numerical error in the small-@xmath8 gsf data by 23 orders of magnitude .",
    "the upshot is a rather poor accuracy in @xmath3 for small @xmath8 values , despite the rather high accuracy of the gsf data itself .",
    "the second limiting factor is the restricted capacity of our gsf code to deal with relatively small-@xmath8 ( i.e. , large radii ) orbits . in our current time - domain architecture , the computational cost increases rapidly with the orbital radius , as a result of the longer evolution time necessary to eliminate the effect of spurious initial radiation .",
    "we are currently practically unable to compute the gsf for orbits with radii larger than @xmath71 .",
    "future advances in gsf computational technology ( e.g. , better treatment of initial conditions , mesh - refinement techniques , or spectral treatments of the perturbation equations  all of which are presently being studied ) are certain to reduce the computational cost of gsf calculations , and to allow us to obtain more accurate gsf data and for larger radii",
    ". it would be interesting to revisit our analysis once more accurate gsf results are at hand .",
    "most importantly , our determination of the _ function _ @xmath3 on the interval @xmath49 has allowed us to compute for the first time the strong - field behavior of a combination of the eob functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 , thereby giving us some information of direct significance for constructing accurate analytical models of the late stages of the dynamics of binary systems .",
    "we have also indicated at the end of the last section how the gsf computation of the special _ marginally - bound `` zoom - whirl '' orbit _ suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite might , thanks to the multiple - point pad strategy introduced here , be used for deriving the global shape of the crucial @xmath31 radial potential @xmath47 in the entire domain @xmath55 .",
    "then , combining this global knowledge of the function @xmath47 with the direct gsf knowledge of the function @xmath3 obtained here , we could further derive the global shape of the function @xmath56 .",
    "this would be a most valuable information for the eob formalism , and could significantly help the development of ar models of coalescing binaries .",
    "unfortunately , our current gsf code can not handle orbits which are not strictly bound , and we are therefore unable to supply the necessary gsf data at the present time .",
    "we are , however , investigating ways to make this calculation possible , and we are hoping to present such analysis in a future paper .    finally , we recall that we now have at hand a gsf code for orbits with arbitrary eccentricities @xcite . in a forthcoming paper @xcite ,",
    "two of us will present a computation of a certain gauge - invariant relation characterizing the conservative @xmath13 dynamics of such orbits .",
    "a gsf  eob analysis may then , for the first time , allow us access to the strong - field behavior of the eob @xmath30 function , which enters the description of the `` radial '' component of the binary motion .",
    "it is our impression that there are profound prospects for further fruitful synergy between the gsf and eob frameworks , and we expect this activity to gain considerable momentum in the coming years .",

    "<S> using a recently presented numerical code for calculating the lorenz - gauge gravitational self - force ( gsf ) , we compute the @xmath0 conservative correction to the precession rate of the small - eccentricity orbits of a particle of mass @xmath1 moving around a schwarzschild black hole of mass @xmath2 . specifically , we study the gauge - invariant function @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is defined as the @xmath0 part of the dimensionless ratio @xmath5 between the squares of the radial and azimuthal frequencies of the orbit , and where @xmath6^{2/3}$ ] is a gauge - invariant measure of the dimensionless gravitational potential ( mass over radius ) associated with the mean circular orbit . </S>",
    "<S> our gsf computation of the function @xmath3 in the interval @xmath7 determines , for the first time , the _ strong - field behavior _ of a combination of two of the basic functions entering the effective one body ( eob ) description of the conservative dynamics of binary systems . </S>",
    "<S> we show that our results agree well in the weak - field regime ( small @xmath8 ) with the 3rd post - newtonian ( pn ) expansion of the eob results , and that this agreement is improved when taking into account the analytic values of some of the logarithmic - running terms occurring at higher pn orders . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we demonstrate that gsf data give access to higher - order pn terms of @xmath3 and can be used to set useful new constraints on the values of yet - undetermined eob parameters . </S>",
    "<S> most significantly , we observe that an _ excellent global representation _ of @xmath3 can be obtained using a simple ` two - point ' pad approximant which combines 3pn knowledge at @xmath9 with gsf information at a single strong - field point ( say , @xmath10 ) . </S>"
