    "bubbly flows are ubiquitous in nature and technology , but exact analytical or numerical results are extremely difficult to obtain , due to the multiscale nature of the problem and due to the moving interfaces . for a review on the numerical modeling we refer to @xcite , for recent reviews on the experimental situation",
    "we refer to @xcite , and our own recent work on the subject has been summarized in @xcite . an excellent overview on the experimental , numerical , and theoretical knowledge for various bubble reynolds numbers can also be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "the motion of the small bubbles in the fluid induces velocity fluctuations that can be either dissipated immediately by viscosity or can be enhanced , thus generating motion on scales much larger than the disturbance dimension .",
    "owing to their random character , these fluctuations are refered to as `` pseudo - turbulence '' @xcite . in a flow initially at rest and only forced by rising bubbles , the pseudo - turbulent fluctuations are the only source of energy .",
    "otherwise they can add to the already existing fluid velocity fluctuations , which are driven in some other way .",
    "depending on the flow conditions and the bubble size distribution , the turbulent energy dissipation may be either enhanced or suppressed .",
    "lance and bataille @xcite have suggested that the effect of bubbles on the flow depends on the ratio of kinetic energy due to the bubble motion and the typical kinetic energy @xmath1 of the fluctuations in the liquid velocity before bubble injection , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the typical flow velocity fluctuation , @xmath4 the void fraction , @xmath5 the bubble rise velocity in still water , and we have taken @xmath6 for the added mass coefficient .",
    "the ratio @xmath7 is called the bubblance parameter @xcite . for @xmath8",
    "the kinetics of the bubbly flow are entirely dominated by the turbulent energy of the flow and the bubbles can be considered as some distortion , such as in the experiments of refs .",
    "@xcite or in the numerical simulations of refs .",
    "@xcite , whereas for @xmath9 the flow is dominated by the bubble motion ; i.e.  we have bubblance rather than turbulence , such as in the experiments of ref.@xcite or in the numerical simulations of ref .  @xcite .",
    "the analogous situation for sedimenting particles has experimentally been analyzed by faeth and coworkers , both for particles in water @xcite and in air @xcite .    in the present work we focus on the bubblance case @xmath10 , namely on microbubbles rising in an initially quiescent flow , where formally @xmath11 .",
    "these conditions imply that pseudo - turbulence , due to the bubbles buoyancy , is the only source of flow energy , thus bubbles drive the turbulence and eventually the energy dissipation .",
    "we will address the following questions : ( i ) what is the time evolution of the energy of bubbly driven turbulence initially at rest ? ( ii ) are microbubbles able to induce in still fluid a flow that possesses similar features as real turbulence , i.e. , can the inertial scaling law characteristic of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence be attained in a flow forced solely by bubbles ? ( iii ) how are bubbles eventually distributed in such flow and what forces determine this distribution ?    to be able to address these questions , the flow should best be driven at least by ten - thousands of bubbles , in order to have sufficient statistics . while hundreds of bubbles can still be treated with front - tracking techniques @xcite , resolving both the shape of the bubble and the flow around it ,",
    "this clearly is no longer possible for ten - thousands of bubbles , and one therefore is forced to employ approximations .",
    "we will thus follow the complementary approach and model the bubbles as _ point - particles _ , on which effective forces such as drag and lift act @xcite , similarily as has also been done by climent and magnaudet @xcite .",
    "we thus disregard the near - field interactions among the bubbles .",
    "also the effective forces had to be modelled , namely by chosing drag and lift coefficients . unfortunately",
    ", the lift coefficient is not well known @xcite . in fact , it depends on the bubble reynolds number and on the local shear and vorticity in a highly non - trivial way @xcite .",
    "moreover , due to the interactions with the wake , effective forces on bubbles can even be non - local in time ( history forces ) @xcite . given these complications , for conceptional simplicity we decided to simply use the auton lift coefficient @xmath12 @xcite , realizing that at best _ qualitative _ agreement between our simulations and possible experiments can be expected .",
    "finally , periodic boundary conditions are employed .",
    "the aim of the present paper can thus only be to identify mechanisms ; no quantitative predictions or comparisons with experiments are possible .",
    "the numerical simulations for bubble - induced convection @xcite or for taylor - couette flow with microbubbles inducing drag reduction @xcite were done in the same spirit with related numerical schemes , and indeed the relevant physical mechanisms could be identified .",
    "our numerical simulations are based on the code extensively described in @xcite but now as stated above with forcing only by the bubbles , to mimick the pseudoturbulent flow .",
    "for completeness we briefly repeat the dynamical equations and the central assumption in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "sections [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] describe the time evolution of global and spectral observables , respectively . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "we propose a qualitative physical explanation for the detected fluid energy time evolution .",
    "section [ sec6 ] contains conclusions .",
    "the motion of a small , undeformable , bubble embedded in a velocity field @xmath13 can be modelled by the equation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) : @xmath14 - 2 { \\bf g } \\\\ \\nonumber - [ { \\bf v}(t)-{\\bf u}(\\y(t),t ) ] \\times \\bomega ( \\y(t),t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the various symbols denote : @xmath15 the bubble position , @xmath16 the bubble velocity , @xmath17 the fluid vorticity , @xmath18 the gravity ( acting in negative z - direction ) , and @xmath19 the relaxation time , i.e.  the time needed to adjust the bubble velocity to that of the fluid .",
    "the latter is related with the terminal velocity @xmath5 in still fluid , @xmath20 . in the case of small bubble reynolds number @xmath21 , with @xmath22 the bubble radius and",
    "@xmath23 the kinematic viscosity , for the bubble response time it holds @xmath24 @xcite . for larger bubbles",
    "the prefactor in this relation is larger than 1/6 , which however would only quantitatively affect our results .",
    "the material derivative ( @xmath25 ) of the fluid velocity is evaluated at the bubble position .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) embodies the effect of fluid acceleration plus added mass , drag force , buoyancy , and lift force , with the lift coefficient set to @xmath12 for simplicity , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite for a detailed description of the terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the computational domain is a cube of side @xmath26 , consisting of @xmath27 mesh points and subjected to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the simulation is started at @xmath28 with the flow at rest and with @xmath29 bubbles with @xmath30 placed at random locations .",
    "bubbles rise because of gravity and transfer momentum to the fluid .",
    "we track their trajectories and we treat each bubble as a point - source of momentum . then , the total action on the flow results by summing the @xmath31-forcing that the bubbles apply at their positions @xcite : @xmath32 here @xmath18 is the gravity , directed along the negative @xmath33 axis .",
    "the induced flow velocity @xmath34 evolves according to the incompressible navier - stokes equation : @xmath35 which is solved by direct numerical simulation .",
    ".simulation parameters for all cases analysed : void fraction @xmath4 , total bubbles number @xmath29 , bubble reynolds number @xmath36 , bubble response time @xmath19 , equivalent radius @xmath22 in physical units , potential flow estimate of the total energy induced in the flow @xmath37 , and time asymptotic estimate from our calculations of the total energy @xmath38 .",
    "this value has been determined from time - averaging the statistically stationary state . in the numerical simulations",
    "the kinematic viscosity @xmath39 , @xmath4 , the rise speed in still fluid @xmath40 , and @xmath19 are fixed , the other quantities result consequently .",
    "in particular , the intensity of the gravity results from @xmath41 and therefore is different in the simulation @xmath42 as compared to the other ones . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we use the pseudo - spectral code described in @xcite where also the other details on the numerical simulations can be found .",
    "the point force approximation is validated by performing the same tests as in @xcite .",
    "we stress that , in contrast to that earlier work of ours , here eq .",
    "( [ nseqs ] ) does not contain any forcing on the large scales : the flow is sustained solely by the bubble forcing term @xmath43 .",
    "we analyse different cases .",
    "a list of the flow and bubbles parameters is shown in table [ table1 ] . in table",
    "[ table2 ] the values of the numerical parameters and their physical equivalents are presented for some of the simulations performed .",
    "we describe the energy time evolution of the pseudo - turbulent field generated by the rise of microbubbles . as already stated , at time @xmath28 ,",
    "the bubbles are randomly placed in the flow , that is originally at rest .",
    "their rise displaces liquid and thus generates velocity fluctuations .",
    "if these fluctuations are not rapidly dissipated by viscosity , they can be transmitted to larger scales . as a consequence ,",
    "large scale motions are produced and the flow may become turbulent .",
    "we investigate this issue by measuring average flow quantities as well as by studying the spectral energy distribution .",
    "we focus on case @xmath44 of table [ table1 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1]@xmath22 we plot the total fluid energy , @xmath45 , as a function of time . in the beginning",
    "@xmath46 undergoes a steep rise , afterwards it slowly decreases , until it begins to oscillate and a statistically stationary state is reached .",
    "the behavior qualitatively resembles that one of the front - tracking simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite , see figure 1 of that paper .",
    "the kinetic energy is mainly generated by the momentum transfer in the direction of gravity , as we confirm by measuring the three components of the fluid velocity fluctuations @xmath47 , with @xmath48 which are much larger in the @xmath33 direction than in the horizontal ones , and the unidimensional taylor - reynolds number , defined as : @xmath49 the behavior of @xmath50 as function of time is presented in fig .",
    "[ reynolds_eps ] .",
    "it is evident from the plot that the flow displays strong asymmetry .",
    "we now compare these results with potential flow theory , see e.g.   the work of van wijngaarden @xcite .",
    "we do not expect agreement , given that we deal with point - particles and that the potential flow results of refs .",
    "@xcite only hold in the high bubble reynolds number case , and here we have @xmath51 between 3 and 5 .",
    "nonetheless , we consider this comparison to be instructive and surprisingly we find the saturated kinetic energy to be of order @xmath52 , in agreement with the potential flow theory results for high @xmath51 bubbles .",
    "however , the redistribution of the energy along the three directions deviates from what is predicted by potential flow analysis , according to which we should have @xcite : @xmath53 the potential flow value is @xmath54 , whereas in our simulation this ratio is about @xmath55 . in the opposite limit , @xmath56 , under stokes flow condition , the fluid equations are linear . in this regime ,",
    "symmetry considerations require that rising bubbles can not force the flow in directions perpendicular to their motion ( provided that there are no walls but periodic boundary conditions as in our case ) , a result that is also intuitive for rising point particles in fluid at rest . as a consequence the ratio @xmath57 .",
    "our result , for small but finite reynolds number , lies in between the two limits discussed .",
    "the same holds for the case of sedimenting particles in water ( with larger particle reynolds numbers between 38 and 545 ) , where this ratio is between 4 and 25 @xcite .",
    "the total energy induced by high @xmath51 bubbles , for which inertia effects are dominant , can be easily estimated by the following argument : at low void fractions the flow energy is the sum of the energy induced by individual bubbles , i.e. , @xmath58 , where the effective _ mass _ of a bubble is @xmath59 , owing to the added mass factor @xmath60 .",
    "thus @xmath61 . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath62 , to estimate the total energy induced by sedimenting particles or rising bubbles is far more complicated . indeed , for @xmath63 , the flow induced by one particle decreases , with the distance @xmath64 from the particle , as @xmath65 , thus leading to a total flow energy that diverges with the system size .",
    "different screening mechanisms have been invoked in the past in order to account for this problem ( see e.g.   @xcite ) , but this issue is beyond the scope of the present paper .    in table",
    "[ table1 ] we report the total energy estimated in our simulations , correspondent to different void fractions and bubble dimensions . in all cases the energy induced is of order @xmath52 .",
    "we note , by comparing cases @xmath44 and @xmath42 , that , when increasing the bubble dimension while fixing the void fraction , thus reducing the total bubble - fluid interface , less energy is generated in the flow .",

    "the intervals correspond to @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 in fig .",
    "the figure depicts that the energy is originally introduced at high wavenumbers and gradually transported to larger scales ( solid line ) .",
    "however , after some time the spectrum flattens and a nearly constant energy is measured at all scales .",
    "thus , in the first stage of bubble - fluid coupling , an _ inverse energy cascade _ , from the small to the large scales , builds up large scale eddies .",
    "the corresponding slope of the spectrum  indicating the local transfer of energy  would be @xmath0 , however , as the taylor - reynolds numbers are small , such a scaling regime can not really develop .",
    "later on , the inverse energy cascade can not be sustained and it finally disappears in the final state .",
    "we investigate whether this last state is statistically stationary by having a closer look at the energy transfer equation in @xmath69-space : @xmath79 here , the various terms indicate , respectively : the energy transfer to wavenumber @xmath69 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 where @xmath82 the viscous dissipation , @xmath83 , and the bubble forcing contribution , @xmath84 , @xmath85 where @xmath86 with @xmath87 the fourier transform of the coupling term @xmath88 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ bubbleforcing ] ) . here",
    "@xmath89 and @xmath90 indicate , respectively , the imaginary and real part of the expression between the brackets .",
    "the spectra of the bubble forcing and of the dissipation are shown in fig .",
    "[ spe_forc_eps]@xmath22 .",
    "the strongest forcing is concentrated on the small scales , as we expect , owing to the dimension of the energy sources . however , the energy that is initially transfered to the large scales via the nonlinear interactions has to return to the small scales in order to be dissipated by viscosity .",
    "in fact , there is no energy sink on the large scales that could take the energy out of the system .",
    "therefore the condition for establishing a stationary state is that the time average energy transfer has to be zero on all wavenumbers , and dissipation has to equal bubble forcing , i.e. , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , where the time dependence has dropped out after the average on time .    as we show in fig .",
    "[ spe_forc_eps]@xmath22 , apart from the large scales where the average still has not converged , this requirement is satisfied by our simulation . in real flow , with walls instead of periodic boundary conditions , energy dissipation in the developing boundary layers will of course eventually play a crucial role in the energy balance .",
    "the time evolution of the energy spectrum can be compared to the one presented by @xcite , where the authors study a similar system , namely fluid motion generated by rising bubbles , by applying a different technique for the implementation of two - way coupling .",
    "the results agree qualitatively , i.e. , the initial induction of structures at large scale is followed by a state in which the slope of the energy spectrum is reduced . as the authors state themselves , the reason is connected with the temporal evolution of the bubble distribution .",
    "indeed , bubble clusters , that are assembled in the beginning and are able to force the liquid efficiently , are not stable and bubbles tend to distribute uniformly in the flow . moreover , the structures induced in the flow itself are far too weak to trap the bubbles .",
    "thus , the phenomenon of vortex trapping of bubbles does not occur and therefore high local bubble concentration as in bubbly turbulent flows ( see e.g.  @xcite ) are not created here .",
    "note that the front - tracking simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite for 27 bubbles with a bubble reynolds number of about 25 gave a quite different spectrum , namely a slope of about @xmath93 in the large wavenumber regime .",
    "indeed , a slope @xmath94 has theoretically been attributed @xcite to this regime , in which the energy deposited by the wake is directly dissipated and which obviously can not be modelled with the point - particle approach .",
    "all this wake energy dissipation is missing in our approach .",
    "we carry on the comparison with the results of @xcite , by looking at the high wavenumbers behavior of the spectrum . in that paper a steeper slope with respect to homogeneous and isotropic turbulence is observed .",
    "the critical wavenumber @xmath95 above which it shows up is estimated by the average distance between the bubbles , that is @xmath96 . in our simulation , for case @xmath44 of table [ table1 ] , we have : @xmath97 ( about @xmath98 of the box with @xmath99 ) , thus @xmath100 and for case @xmath42 : @xmath101 , thus @xmath102 . as we show in fig .",
    "[ spe_final_eps ] , a transition in the slope of the energy spectrum occurs at high wavenumbers .",

    "we again also compare our results with the case for sedimenting particles in originally still fluid @xcite : also for that case the energy spectrum is very broad .",
    "the spectral slope of the frequency spectrum was found to be around @xmath106 for remarkably several decades , but a comparison of this value with the slopes in the wavenumber spectra obtained in this paper is difficult as taylor s frozen flow hypothesis will most likely not hold for this weak turbulence .",
    "the occurrence of the inverse cascade phenomenon in three dimensional turbulence has been related to the presence of strong anisotropies at small scales ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these anisotropies can be produced by bubble clusters elongated in the gravity direction . within them ,",
    "the energy production term due to the bubbles can be far more intense in the vertical direction than in the horizontal ones , owing to the high values reached by the @xmath107 contribution .",
    "the stability of these structures is opposed by horizontal forces that laterally spread the bubbles .",
    "when considering the bubble motion equation , it appears that the lift is the most relevant of such forces .",

    "the spectrum is averaged on four subsequent time intervals , which are the same as for fig [ fig3]@xmath22 .",
    "the process of inverse energy cascade is now strongly enhanced .",
    "in fact , the spectral intensity at small wavenumbers increases in time , whereas it is constant at large ones .",
    "moreover , it is remarkable that a local slope close to @xmath0 settles nearly at once at high wavenumbers and is stable during the whole process ",
    "though the scaling regime again is not very pronounced due to the small taylor - reynolds numbers .",
    "therefore the small scale forcing is strong enough to generate a flow that presents the same characteristics as real three - dimensional turbulence  or also two - dimensional turbulence in the inverse cascade regime . on the other hand ,",
    "this simulation is not statistically stationary . in fig .",
    "[ spe_forc_eps]@xmath7 , we show that there is a difference on a wide range of scales between the bubbles forcing term @xmath109 and the fluid viscous dissipation @xmath110 .",
    "thus the condition of stationarity is not fulfilled and the large flow scales are still fed with energy from the small ones .",
    "we again stress that the model for the equation of motion without lift force does not give a complete representation of the surface forces acting on bubbles or particles of @xmath30 . indeed , previous works ( see e.g.   refs.@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of uniform shear ) have pointed out the relevance of the lift in this regime .",
    "of course our results can only expected to be qualitative and not quantitative , as the near - field interactions between the bubbles is not correctly described by the present point - particle approach and as the lift coefficient is set to be constant , @xmath111",
    ". however , refined expressions for the lift force are not likely to give qualitatively different behaviors .",
    "the main effect of the lift is to cause the bubble dispersion along the horizontal directions , thus strongly reducing the anisotropy in the flow caused by the forcing in the vertical direction . indeed , by definition",

    "we base our analysis on the description of the two - bubble long range interactions proposed in ref .",
    "the main finding is that a bubble in the wake of another one experiences , because of the lift , a lateral force , leading to a deficit of nearby bubbles in the gravity direction ( see fig .",
    "[ koch_eps ] ) .",

    "a negative autocorrelation at small distances @xmath117 is detected also in the horizontal planes .",
    "the interpretation of the result is that the bubbles approach is resisted by the lift , and this is occurring especially in the vertical direction , where a bubble rising in the wake of another experiences horizontal forces that expels it from the wake .",
    "qualitatively , the organization of the bubbles in our simplified simulations is similar to what has been observed in above mentioned front tracking simulations by tryggvason and coworkers @xcite or in the experiments of ref.@xcite : small bubbles with @xmath62 were dispersed in a nearly homogeneous manner , with an increasing tendency of horizontal alignment when the bubble reynolds number approaches 10 . also in the recent experiments by harteveld _",

    "the results show that the bubble motion initially generates large scale structures by local in scale energy transfer , though the corresponding @xmath0 scaling regime in the spectrum is not very pronounced due to the small taylor - reynolds numbers .",
    "later on , however , the bubbles distribution tends to be more disperse , the energy spectrum becomes flat and energy input equal viscous dissipation at all scales .",
    "therefore , the statistically stationary state of this pseudo - turbulent velocity field does not possess the characteristics of real turbulence .",
    "we give qualitative evidence that the physics that determines it are the bubble - bubble indirect interactions that occur via the carrier flow .",

    "<S> we investigate by direct numerical simulations the flow that rising bubbles cause in an originally quiescent fluid . we employ the eulerian - lagrangian method with two - way coupling and periodic boundary conditions . in order to be able to treat up to 288000 bubbles , the following approximations and simplifications had to be introduced , as done before e.g.   by climent and magnaudet , phys .  </S>",

    "<S> the results suggest that large scale motions are generated , owing to an _ inverse energy cascade _ from the small to the large scales . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the taylor - reynolds number is only in the range of 1 , the corresponding scaling of the energy spectrum with an exponent of @xmath0 can not develop over a pronounced range . in the long term , the property of local energy transfer , characteristic of real turbulence , </S>",
    "<S> is lost and the input of energy equals the viscous dissipation at all scales . due to the lack of strong vortices the bubbles spread rather uniformly in the flow . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism for uniform spreading is as follows : rising bubbles induce a velocity field behind them that acts on the following bubbles . </S>",
    "<S> owing to the shear , those bubbles experience a lift force which make them spread to the left or right , thus preventing the formation of vertical bubble clusters and therefore of efficient forcing . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , when the lift is artifically put to zero in the simulations , the flow is forced much more efficiently and a more pronounced energy accumulates at large scales ( due to the inverse energy cascade ) is achieved . </S>"
