    "in the standard model ( sm ) , processes mediated by flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) are forbidden at the tree level , occurring only through diagrams with one or more loops .",
    "this is consistent with experimental observations , which show that the corresponding physical observables appear to be highly suppressed .",
    "now , it is important to determine if the experimental results are in fact in agreement with sm predictions , and to establish what room is available for the presence of new physics .",
    "we analyze here this problem in the framework of the so - called 331 models , in which the sm gauge symmetry group is enlarged to @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "these models have the important feature of relating the number of quark families with the number of colors , through the requirement of anomaly cancellation . as a byproduct ,",
    "the extension of the gauge group implies the presence of a new neutral gauge boson @xmath2 , which in general gives rise to flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) at the tree level .",
    "in addition , 331 models show other interesting aspects , such as the presence of neutrino masses , neutral and charged scalars , exotic quarks , etc .  which can be investigated in the next generation of colliders like the lhc and the ilc .",
    "for example , the nonstandard neutral current could be identified at the lhc by looking at the process @xmath4 : performing specific kinematic cuts on the outgoing electrons , it would be possible to reduce background so as to distinguish the @xmath2 current within the 331 model from other theories that include physics beyond the sm  @xcite .    concerning the presence of fcnc , it is important to point out that in 331 models it is not possible to fit all quark families in multiplets having the same quantum numbers . as a consequence , while the @xmath5 couplings to ordinary quarks and leptons remain the same as in the sm , the corresponding @xmath2 couplings are not universal for all quark families .",
    "this gives rise to tree level flavor violation when rotating from the current quark basis to the mass eigenstate basis .",
    "the size of the couplings depends on the angles and phases of the ( left - handed ) up and down quark mixing matrices @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which therefore become separately observable ( in the framework of the sm , only the elements of the matrix @xmath8 can be measured ) . due to the unitarity of these mixing matrices , predictions for fcnc observables in the 331 models",
    "are in general related to each other . in order to establish bounds for this new physics",
    ", the most interesting sector is that of the down - like quarks @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where there are several well - measured observables at our disposal .",
    "here we concentrate on fcnc processes in which flavor changes by two units .",
    "these typically show the most important suppression within the sm , and consequently the most stringent bounds for new physics .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the down quark sector , taking into account the following experimental data for five @xmath12 observables , where @xmath13  @xcite : @xmath14 here @xmath15 and @xmath16 are cp - violating parameters , defined in connection with @xmath17 and @xmath18 mixing respectively ( in fact , @xmath16 arises from the interference between cp violation in @xmath19 mixing and decay , the latter usually assumed to be negligible ) .",
    "it is important to stress that the measurement of @xmath20 , recently obtained  @xcite , is the first accurate experimental value of a @xmath21 observable , and has attracted significant theoretical interest  @xcite . as stated , the @xmath2 contribution to this quantity in the 331 model can be directly related with the contributions to the other observables in eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) , allowing us to perform a global fit of the allowed region for the down - like quark mixing parameters .",
    "this represents the main motivation for the present work .    in the literature",
    "there are different versions of the 331 models , according to the fermion content and quantum numbers , and the number of scalar @xmath22 multiplets needed to break the gauge symmetry so as to provide fermion masses . in general , these theories also include exotic quarks of nonstandard charges .",
    "the first versions of the models included three scalar triplets and one scalar sextet  @xcite , and new `` quarks '' with electric charges @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( in fact , exotic fermions can carry both quark and lepton numbers different from zero ) . for definiteness and simplicity we will consider here",
    "a particular 331 model that has been called `` economical ''  @xcite , since it deals with a minimal scalar sector of only two triplets , and does not include fermions with nonstandard charges , i.e. , other than @xmath25 , @xmath26 for `` quarks '' and 0 or @xmath27 for `` leptons '' .",
    "recently , the ability of this model to reproduce the observed neutrino mass pattern has been discussed  @xcite , and a supersymmetric version of the model has been presented  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .  2 we present an overview of 331 models , focusing on the @xmath2-mediated neutral currents . in sect .",
    "3 we derive the expressions for the new contributions to @xmath12 observables .",
    "our numerical analysis , including a comparison with the expected results using a definite ansatz for quark mass matrices , is presented in sect .",
    "4 . finally , in sect .  5",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "as stated earlier , in 331 models the sm gauge group is enlarged to @xmath28 .",
    "the fermions are organized into @xmath22 multiplets , which include the standard quarks and leptons , as well as exotic particles usually called @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . though the criterion of anomaly cancellation leads to some constraints in the fermion quantum numbers , still an infinite number of 331 models",
    "is allowed . in general ,",
    "the electric charge can be written as a linear combination of the diagonal generators of the group , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a parameter that characterizes the specific 331 model particle structure and quantum numbers .",
    "the organization of the three fermion families in 331 models is sketched in table i , where @xmath34 labels the quark family in the interaction basis , and @xmath35 .",
    "notice that the charges of the exotic particles depend on the chosen value of the parameter @xmath33 .",
    "as stated in the introduction , the so called `` economical '' 331 models  @xcite are defined as those that do not include fermions with nonstandard charges .",
    "given the structure in table i , this is possible only if one takes @xmath36 , plus and minus sign corresponding to exotic leptons of charge @xmath27 and 0 ( the correspondence is convention dependent ) . concerning the scalar sector , in the economical models it is possible to give masses to all fermions and to reproduce the desired symmetry breaking pattern with only two scalar triplets , usually called @xmath37 and @xmath38 . choosing @xmath39 ,",
    "the vacuum expectation values of these scalar fields can be written as @xmath40 and @xmath41 , while for @xmath42 one has @xmath43 and @xmath44 . the spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking proceeds into two steps : a first breaking @xmath45 at the energy scale given by the vev @xmath46 , and a second sm - like breaking at a scale @xmath47  gev . as usual ,",
    "fermion masses are obtained from yukawa - like couplings with the scalar fields .",
    "it is seen that the model is able to provide the observed fermion mass pattern , where the vev @xmath46 sets the mass scale for the exotic fermions  @xcite .",

    "it is convenient to rotate these states into a new basis where one can identify the usual sm gauge fields @xmath74 and @xmath5 , together with a new @xmath2 state .",
    "the corresponding transformation for arbitrary @xmath33 reads @xmath75 where we have introduced a weinberg angle ( @xmath76 , etc . ) .",

    "we are interested now in the couplings of the new @xmath2 state to ordinary quarks , in particular , to down - like quarks @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , since we will deal here with neutral @xmath0 , @xmath19 and @xmath82 mesons . in terms of the electroweak current eigenstates @xmath83 , it can be seen  @xcite that the corresponding interaction lagrangian is given by @xmath84 \\",

    "( [ dnc ] ) is the fact that @xmath2 couplings to left - handed quarks are not flavor - diagonal .",
    "this is a consequence of the group structure of the 331 models shown in table i : the requirement of anomaly cancellation is satisfied only if one of the quark families is in a different @xmath22 representation than the other two , which leads to different quark-@xmath2 couplings . on the other hand",
    ", it is worth to notice that the @xmath2 couplings to right - handed quarks turn out to be flavor diagonal .",
    "moreover , notice that in the case of left - handed quarks the nondiagonal part of the interaction depends on the choice of @xmath33 only through the value of the global coupling constant @xmath87 . in terms of @xmath81 and @xmath77",
    ", one has @xmath88 in this way , since phenomenologically the value of @xmath89 at the electroweak breaking scale is close to 1/4 , the choices @xmath90 leads to an enhancement of the quark-@xmath2 couplings . for example , the ratio between the couplings @xmath78 in the economical ( @xmath91 ) and original ( @xmath92 ) versions of the 331 models at the @xmath93 scale is given by @xmath94 in the particular case of economical 331 models , the couplings in eq .",

    "finally , let us point out that in general the states @xmath5 and @xmath2 are only approximate mass eigenstates , while the true physical states @xmath102 and @xmath103 can be obtained from the former after a rotation .",
    "the corresponding mixing angle @xmath104 is expected to be small , since it becomes suppressed by a factor @xmath105 , i.e. , the square of the ratio between the @xmath106 and @xmath107 symmetry breaking scales . in the case of economical 331 models , at leading order in @xmath108 one finds  @xcite @xmath109}{w^2 } \\ \\ .\\ ] ] though this angle will be in general small , @xmath110 mixing will induce flavor changes .",

    "one of the most stringent tests for the model is provided by the effect of fcnc s , which arise at tree level owing to the presence of nonuniversal couplings of a neutral gauge boson @xmath2 .",
    "here we have concentrated on the study of flavor mixing in the down quark sector , where @xmath12 observables provide a set of experimental data that allows one to obtain the bounds for the relevant model parameters .",
    "our parameter space includes five variables , namely the angles @xmath156 , @xmath155 and the cp - violating phases @xmath209 , @xmath211 , coming from the @xmath7 mixing matrix , and the scale parameter @xmath170 [ or , in general , the combination @xmath249 . in the economical model , taking @xmath250 , we have found upper bounds for the mixing angles @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
    "these bounds are in fact correlated , and depend on the values of the phases @xmath209 and @xmath211 .",
    "the allowed region for @xmath155 with @xmath202 is shown in fig .  1 , while the allowed regions for @xmath156 taking extreme values of @xmath155 are shown in figs .  2 and 3 ( @xmath193 and @xmath220 confidence level , respectively ) .",
    "in general , these last regions are found to depend both on @xmath209 and @xmath211 .",
    "we have also shown how these bounds scale with the value of @xmath170 increasing the @xmath48 breaking scale by a factor five .",
    "finally , for the sake of illustration we have compared these results with the expected values of the down quark mixing angles within a four - zero texture ansatz for the mass matrices .",
    "we have found that imposing such an ansatz in the context of economical 331 models would be compatible with experimental data for fcnc observables at @xmath193 level , provided that the @xmath48 symmetry breaking occurs at a scale above 5 tev .",
