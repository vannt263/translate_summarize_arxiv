    "calculating switching rates of small magnetic elements is a very important problem in magnetic information storage .",
    "in addition to conventional field - switched media , new ideas for storing information in vortex chirality and polarity @xcite and spin torque switched elements @xcite require calculation of switching rates , both with external fields ( modeling the writing process ) and without ( modeling stability ) .",
    "several approaches have been explored for this purpose , all ultimately involving the solution of a fokker - planck equation for the probability distribution of the system .",
    "the problem was first approached by brown @xcite in 1963 , who computed the switching rate for a coherent single - domain uniaxially symmetric particle . in this case",
    "the system is described by a single variable , the angle @xmath0 of the magnetization from the easy axis , or alternatively the easy - axis component @xmath1 of the magnetic dipole moment .",
    "once the problem has been reduced to a one - dimensional one described by a stochastic langevin - like equation of the form @xmath2where the variance of the random term is a known function of @xmath1 , the rate can be determined by the well - established method of kramers(1940)@xcite .",
    "brown s approach can be generalized somewhat @xcite but is limited to coherently - switching systems .",
    "if we go beyond coherent systems to a system with a spatially - varying magnetization described by a micromagnetic model with n cells , the configuration space of the system is @xmath3-dimensional and very hard to visualize .",
    "a general method for rate calculation , involving the expansion of the energy function in a power series near the saddle point in 2n - dimensional configurational space ( a hessian matrix ) was developed by langer _",
    "et al _ @xcite and has been applied to magnetic systems@xcite . however",
    ", this approach is computationally demanding ( because it involves @xmath4 matrices ) , somewhat formal ( giving little heuristic insight into what physical factors control the rate ) , and because it involves only information near the saddle point , can not be exact in the low temperature limit in the sense that the present approach appears to be .    the approach we will take in the present paper is to map our 2n - dimensional system into a 1d system governed by a langevin equation , and compute the switching rate of that 1d system by the method of kramers .",
    "we will develop the method in the context of an exchange - coupled or anisotropy - gradient element , which is known@xcite to switch incoherently by a sort of domain wall motion , from the initial state shown in fig .",
    "[ init ] to a final reversed state ( see fig .",
    "[ configs ] below ) .",
    "we use an anisotropy variation @xmath5 , which can be shown to give optimal switching in the limit of a long particle@xcite .",
    "we also ignore magnetostatic fields in this calculation .    , ranging from @xmath6 at the left ( @xmath7 ) to @xmath8 ka / m at the right ( very high , but based on numbers for fept ) .",
    "we use exchange constant @xmath9 j / m and @xmath10 ka / m.,width=3 ]    although it is very difficult to make direct comparisons with conventional stochastic simulation ( because simulation is very difficult for these very slow rates ) , it seems likely that this method is exact in the limit of low temperatures ( large @xmath11 ) , because the deviations from the minimum - energy path vanish in this limit . in this paper",
    "we will not deal with the question of global searches for saddle points and switching paths for arbitrary systems  we are using a relatively simple system ( a graded - anisotropy grain ) for which the switching mechanism ( dw motion ) is already known .",
    "the switching involves motion along or near a one - dimensional path in @xmath3-dimensional space , the switching path , parameterized by a single real number , the switching coordinate .",
    "the simplest choice for this switching coordinate is of course @xmath1 , the moment along the easy ( long ) axis of the element , as in the original brown theory . in this original theory",
    ", @xmath1 determines the energy of the system , since the energy is independent of azimuthal angle . we could hope that even in an incoherently switching system , this single `` coarse - grained '' variable still essentially determines the state of the system , in the sense that if we specify @xmath1 , fluctuations in the other variables ( except the irrelevant azimuthal angle ) are small , because they are expensive in energy .",
    "that is , @xmath1 determines values for the other @xmath12 variables ( obtained by minimizing the energy at fixed @xmath1 ) from which fluctuations are small , because the energy function rises rapidly when these other variables deviate from their minimum - energy values .",
    "this picture turns out to be true near the initial state , as a reversed domain forms , and as the domain wall moves .",
    "however , when this domain wall approaches its highest energy ( when it is in the hard end of the system , see inset labeled `` saddle point '' in fig .",
    "[ configs ] below ) @xmath1 no longer specifies the state of the system uniquely .",
    "there are many states with the same @xmath1 , and about the same energy .",
    "one way to see this is to observe that in this configuration , we can increase @xmath1 by moving the domain wall to the right ( tilting the magnetizations near the domain wall counterclockwise ) , * or * by shortening the tail of the domain wall ( tilting the magnetizations in the soft end counterclockwise ) . near the saddle point , neither of these costs much energy .",
    "doing these two things at the same time leaves @xmath13 unchanged .",
    "thus a single coarse - grained variable is not sufficient to describe the system  we need to identify a second variable and hope that the state is determined by the two variables together . noting that the two states of increased @xmath1 mentioned above have the increase in different places ( in the hard end and the soft end respectively , _",
    "i. e. _ at positive and negative x , if we take our origin at the center of the grain ) , we see that they will have different values of the weighted average @xmath14 note that this is just the quadrupole moment .",
    "thus we can hope to describe the system by the two coarse - grained variables @xmath1 and @xmath15 , in the sense that if we fix these two variables and minimize the energy with respect to the remaining @xmath12 variables , the fluctuations of these remaining variables ( except , again , the azimuthal angle ) are small .",
    "we can think of these remaining variables as `` short wavelength spin waves '' . denoting this minimum value by @xmath16 , we can plot the contours of constant energy as functions of @xmath1 and @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ configs ] )        , with maximum @xmath17.,width=3 ]    in the context of this contour plot , we can understand more clearly the failure of @xmath1 to completely describe the system .",
    "if it did , the energy would rise rapidly as we move away from the minimum in any of the other @xmath18 directions , including that described by @xmath15 .",
    "that is , the energy at fixed @xmath1 would have a sharp minimum as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ min ] that this is true for the first part of the switching ( at the left ) but the minima get shallower as we approach the saddle point , finally disappearing entirely at the saddle point .",
    "so far , we have a 2d projection of the motion that allows us to visualize it , but we have not defined a unique switching path  we have seen that minimizing the energy at fixed @xmath1 is * not * a suitable method for doing so . another way to define a switching path is by steepest descent in energy . at the saddle point , where @xmath18 of the @xmath3 principal curvatures of the energy function are positive , there is a unique direction in which the curvature is downward .",
    "moving in this direction , and continuing along the energy gradient , defines a unique path which eventually reaches the minimum - energy initial saturated configuration ( fig .",
    "[ init ] ) .",
    "this appears to be the same path that is obtained by `` nudged elastic band '' methods @xcite , but we have computed it by following the energy gradient , which is equivalent to the use of the landau - lifshitz - gilbert dynamical equation for the magnetization @xmath19 of a single macrospin : @xmath20 in the limit of infinite landau - lifshitz damping factor @xmath21 , so it becomes @xmath22we must let the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath23 as well , such that the ratio @xmath24 remains finite .",
    "physically , this eliminates the precession term and causes the system to move along the energy gradient in 2n - dimensional configuration space .",
    "although the system can not be described at all points of the switching process by specifying the single variable @xmath1 and allowing the other variables to relax to their minimum - energy values , this does * not * mean that the switching process is not in some sense one - dimensional .",
    "the energy still goes up if we move in the direction normal to the steepest descent ( sd ) path ( along the sd path is the only direction in which it goes down ) . if we define a new `` switching coordinate '' in the @xmath3 dimensional space by by projecting each point perpendicularly onto the sd path , then fluctuations from these projected points are indeed small ( the energy goes up rapidly perpendicular to this path ) .",
    "the system can still be described by a single variable , it just ca nt be @xmath1 in the sense that we described above .",
    "we can parameterize the path in any way we want  for example , we could use the path length along the sd path as a switching coordinate .",
    "however , this would be numerically complicated , and we could equally well use any monotonic function of this path length .",
    "paradoxically , @xmath1 is such a monotonic function , though we just argued that it can not be used to uniquely or almost - uniquely describe the system !",
    "the resolution of this paradox is that we can not determine the other variables by minimizing the energy in a hyperplane of constant @xmath1 ( a vertical plane in fig .",
    "[ configs ] )  there is no sharp minimum .",
    "however , if we minimize the energy in a hyperplane perpendicular to the sd path , there * is * a sharp minimum that determines all the other variables .",
    "this leads us to a prescription for mapping an arbitrary system trajectory onto a random walk along the sd path . at each point of the sd path",
    ", we calculate the energy gradient ( which is the tangent to the sd path ) and draw the @xmath18 dimensional hyperplane normal to this direction . if the trajectory is close to the sd path , it will be on one and only one of these hyperplanes , and this determines its switching coordinate . [ if it is far away , farther than the radius of curvature of the sd path , it could be on two such hyperplanes  but this point would have very high energy , so we will assume that this is a rare event and worry about it later . ]",
    "to describe the statistics of switching , we now must write an equation of motion for the switching coordinate , which should take the form of a langevin equation .",
    "since we are parameterizing the sd path by @xmath1 , this is an equation for @xmath25 . to avoid problems related to the ito - stratonovich ambiguity@xcite",
    ", we find it better to discuss the change @xmath26 during a finite time increment @xmath27 of a micromagnetic simulation",
    ". we must be careful how we define the change @xmath26 from the actual change in configuration ( the magnetization change @xmath28 at cell @xmath29 ) .",
    "we can not just substitute this change into eq .",
    "[ mx ] to get @xmath26 , but we must first project the new configuration back to the sd path , and only then use eq .",
    "being similarly careful about defining the diffusion term ( variance of @xmath26 ) , we end up with a langevin equation of the form of eq .",
    "since the dependence on the external field @xmath30 is linear , we may put it into the form @xmath31\\delta t + \\left ( \\delta m_x \\right)_{random}\\ ] ] this expression is exactly derived from the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation  however , it is important to realize that it is exact only on the 1d sd path .",
    "to the extent that the real stochastic system deviates from this path , it is only approximate .",
    "the accuracy could be checked by examining the actual switching trajectories in a stochastic simulation , although this would be possible only for unrealistically low @xmath11 ( in a real device , this should be at least 40 ) . as @xmath32 , we expect the actual trajectories to become arbitrarily close to the sd path .",
    "we have defined the `` field mobility '' @xmath33 as the coefficient of the external field in the function @xmath34 in eq .",
    "[ lang ] ; it is a sum over the cells , whose most important characteristic is that it has contributions only from the domain wall , _",
    "i. e. , _ the contribution depends on the hard - axis component of the magnetization .",
    "in fact , an approximate expression for the field mobility is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the volume of the domain wall ( a small fraction of the total volume @xmath37 ) .",
    "we have also defined the pinning field ( the field required to keep the domain wall stationary ) @xmath38 the random term is defined by its variance @xmath39 which is a function of position @xmath1 along the path ",
    "@xmath40 can be calculated from the magnetization configuration @xmath41 .",
    "it is related to the mobility by an einstein relation , @xmath42    this 1d motion is slightly more general than langevin s original formulation , in that the mobility and diffusivity ( which are constant in a textbook langevin equation ) are functions of position in our langevin equation .",
    "we use the method of kramers@xcite to compute the rate from our 1d langevin equation .",
    "this involves beginning with the fokker - planck equation for the probability distribution of solutions to eq .",
    "[ lang2 ] .",
    "we assume the distribution near the barrier is in a steady state , in which the probability current @xmath43 is small and uniform .",
    "following kramers , we write the probability density as a function @xmath44 times its equilibrium value : @xmath45/k_b t}\\ ] ] so that @xmath46 in the switched well ( @xmath47 ) , and is constant in the initial well . inserting this into eq .",
    "[ j ] , letting @xmath48 , and using the uniformity of the current gives an equation for this constant , @xmath49 the switching rate is then @xmath50 , where in the populated part of the initial well , @xmath51 , so @xmath52 @xmath53 the first integral in the denominator is dominated by the vicinity of the barrier , where @xmath54 .",
    "we can bring out the arrhenius factor to give @xmath55 where the prefactor ( `` attempt frequency '' ) is @xmath56/k_b t } dm_x } \\int _ { - m_s } ^ { + m_x } { e^ { - e(m_x ) /k_b",
    "t } dm_x } } } \\ ] ]    using eq .",
    "[ pre ] , we can numerically calculate the integrals appearing in the rate prefactor from our calculations of the states along the sd ( steepest - descent ) path .",
    "however , it is also interesting to look at the effects of some simple approximations to these integrals , because it sheds light on the connection with the brown result for coherent switching .",
    "brown s 1963 result for the prefactor of a uniaxial particle with anisotropy field @xmath57",
    "was@xcite @xmath58 we can put our result in a similar form ",
    "first note that the first integral in the denominator of eq .",
    "[ r ] is very sharply peaked at the energy barrier , especially at low temperatures .",
    "we can approximate the energy by a quadratic function near its peak @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a dimensionless barrier width factor , of order @xmath61 . also at reasonably low temperatures , the second integral in the denominator of eq .",
    "[ r ] depends only on the initial slope of @xmath62 near the initial state , which is the nucleation field @xmath63 .",
    "these approximations allow us to evaluate both integrals analytically , giving us @xmath64 surprisingly , this is identical to brown s result for the coherent case , except that the nucleation field is playing the role of the anisotropy field , and there are factors of the domain wall fraction @xmath65 and the barrier width parameter @xmath60 , which should be of order @xmath61 .",
    "the proportionality to the domain wall width is easy to understand physically , because magnetization fluctuations outside the domain wall can not drive domain wall motion .    to check the importance of continuous anisotropy grading (",
    "as opposed to having layers of uniform but different anisotropy ) we considered a series of systems obtained from a continuously graded system by constructing layers and assigning each a uniform anisotropy equal to the average over its volume in the continuously graded system .",
    "as the number of layers increases , we thus expect the behavior to get closer to that of the continuous system .",
    "however , with 1 layer ( a uniform system ) we expect coherent rotation , then with 2 or more layers the switching mechanism involves a domain wall . from eq .",
    "[ r0 ] , we expect a large decrease in rate prefactor when a domain wall appears ( @xmath66 ) , and this is confirmed by the numerical results ( fig .",
    "[ attempt ] ) .",
    "there is suprisingly little change if we increase the number of layers beyond 2 .",
    "the advantage of using more than 2 layers lies instead in the improved coercivity .",
    "we have also computed the coercivity as a function of number of layers , and find that the coercivity increases as we decrease the number of layers , because this increases the anisotropy jump at the interfaces and therefore the strength of the domain wall pinning at these interfaces .    ) .",
    "the red circles are obtained by direct numerical integral of the energy landscape ( eq . [ pre ] ) .",
    "the switching rate prefactor of the stoner - wohlfarth particle ( one layer ) is obtained by analytical calculation of the energy landscape assuming that the energy barrier is the same as a 20-cell anisotropy - graded system.,width=6 ]",
    "in this paper we have outlined a new method for the calculation of switching rates of incoherently switching micromagnetic systems , and applied it to a simple graded - anisotropy system .",
    "the result can be put into a form that is surprisingly similar to the form derived in 1963 by brown for coherent switching , except for factors that can be physically interpreted as effects of incoherence , such as the domain wall width .",
    "the predicted rates can be tested by comparison with direct simulation , and such tests are planned .",
