    "star formation has been a long - standing target in astrophysics .",
    "the infrared protostar distribution revealed that the molecular cloud cores , which coincide with relatively high - density part ( @xmath2 ) of the molecular clouds , are the sites of star formation .",
    "the observed molecular cloud cores are divided into two categories : those observed associated with and without protostars .",
    "the molecular cloud cores without protostars are called starless cores or prestellar cores and are considered younger than the cores associated with protostars ( protostellar cores ) . from a theoretical point of view , clouds or cloud cores",
    "experience the isothermal run - away collapse first and then accretion on to the stellar core develops @xcite .",
    "prestellar cores which indicates inflow motions ( e.g. in l1544 rotation and infall velocities @xmath3 are observed by @xcite ) do indicate that they are in the dynamically contracting phase , in other words , in the run - away collapse @xcite .",
    "after the epoch when the dust thermal emissions are trapped in the central part of the cloud ( @xmath4 ) , an adiabatic core is formed and isothermal gas continues to accrete on to the core .",
    "the molecular cloud core in this phase is observed as a protostellar core .",
    "it is shown that the dynamical evolution of the cloud core is characterized by the sequence from the prestellar cores to protostellar cores .",
    "dynamical collapse of the magnetized clouds are studied by many authors @xcite .",
    "rotating clouds collapse has been attacked seriously with numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "however , a restricted number of articles are published regarding the dynamical contraction of the cloud with both rotation and magnetic fields @xcite ; for quasistatic evolution see @xcite .",
    "these researches are confined to the relatively early prestellar stage .",
    "is it sufficient to consider the effects of the rotational motion and the magnetic fields separately ? in the dynamical contraction phase , it is shown that the molecular outflow is driven by the cooperative effect of the magnetic fields and rotation motion @xcite .",
    "the toroidal magnetic fields are generated from the poloidal ones by the effect of rotation motions .",
    "the magnetic torque works only when the poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields coexist . the magnetic torque and thus magnetic angular momentum transfer along the magnetic field line is important to eject the outflow .",
    "since the outflow brings the excess angular momentum , the angular momentum that remain in the adiabatic core and thus new - born star is reduced by a factor from @xmath5 to @xmath6 from that of the parent molecular cloud core @xcite .",
    "the outflow have not observed either in the magnetized but non - rotating cloud @xcite or the rotating but non - magnetized cloud @xcite .",
    "therefore , rotation and magnetic fields are both essential to the evolution of molecular cloud cores . in the present paper ,",
    "we present the dynamical contraction of the magnetized and rotating cloud .",
    "the cooperative effect of magnetic fields and the rotation motions becomes important after the adiabatic core is formed near the center of the cloud core @xcite .",
    "therefore , the evolution throughout from the prestellar to protostellar core should be studied .",
    "plan of this paper is as follows : in @xmath72 model and numerical method are described . as the initial condition",
    ", we choose a slowly rotating cloud with purely poloidal magnetic fields ( no toroidal magnetic fields ) .",
    "and we follow the evolution using magnetohydrodynamical simulations .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the numerical results . in this section",
    "we compare clouds with strong magnetic fields and those with weak magnetic fields .",
    "this shows that completely different two types of outflows are ejected in respective clouds .",
    "another comparison is made between fast rotators and slow rotators . in @xmath74",
    ", we discuss the evolution till the second core , which becomes actually a new - born star , is formed .",
    "it is found that another outflow is found around the second core , which seems to correspond to the optical jets or high speed neutral winds .",
    "we also discuss whether the mass inflow / outflow rate and the momentum outflow rate observed in molecular bipolar outflows are explained or not .",
    "to study the dynamical contraction , we consider an isothermal cylindrical cloud in hydrostatic balance with infinite length as the initial state . in terms of the gravitational potential @xmath8 and isothermal sound speed @xmath9 ,",
    "the radial distributions of density @xmath10 , rotation speed @xmath11 , and magnetic field density @xmath12 are calculated using the equation of hydrostatic balance as @xmath13 and the poisson equation for the self - gravity as @xmath14 where @xmath15 represents the gravitational constant .",
    "this equation has a solution as follows @xcite @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 with using the scale - height at the center , @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 represent respectively the density , the angular rotation speed , and the magnetic flux density at the center of the cylindrical cloud ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "this is the same hydrostatic configuration studied by @xcite .",
    "however , we assume no initial toroidal magnetic field @xmath24 in contrast to them .",
    "the density distribution extends till the radius where the thermal pressure @xmath25 becomes equal to the external pressure @xmath26 .",
    "the solution contains three non - dimensional parameters characterizing the distribution after adopting natural normalization such as for distance @xmath27 $ ] , time @xmath28 $ ] , and density @xmath29 .",
    "we summarized the conversion factors from non - dimensional to physical quantities in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the first parameter characterizing the initial state is related to the magnetic to thermal pressure ratio as @xmath30 and the second one is related to the angular rotation speed as @xmath31 finally the surface to center density ratio @xmath32 the scale - height at the center @xmath33 is expressed using these non - dimensional parameters as @xmath34 from this equation , it is shown that a hydrostatic balance is achieved only when @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "@xcite s @xmath37 parameter , which represents the ratio of the centrifugal force to the thermal pressure force , is expressed using our parameters as @xmath38    to initiate the cloud collapse , we added a small density perturbation .",
    "the wavelength of the perturbation is taken equal to that of the most unstable jeans mode .",
    "the linear instability of the rotating , magnetized , isothermal cylindrical cloud is studied by @xcite .",
    "they gave a fitting formula for the most unstable wavelength as follows : @xmath39^{-1 }    \\simeq \\frac{2\\pi \\left(1+\\alpha/2+\\beta \\right)^{1/2 } }          { 0.72 \\left[\\left(1+\\alpha/2+\\beta\\right)^{1/3}-0.6 \\right ] f^{1/2 } } ,                              \\label{eq12}\\ ] ] using equations ( [ eq7 ] ) , ( [ eq9 ] ) , and ( [ eq11 ] ) .",

    "hereafter , we omit the primes which indicate the non - dimensional quantities , unless the quantities are confused with dimensional ones .    from calculations of one - dimensional , non - rotating , non - magnetized cloud , the effective equation of state of the gas forming a star is summarized as follows @xcite .",
    "gas in the molecular cloud core with @xmath43 obeys the isothermal equation of state with the temperature of @xmath44k .",
    "however , the molecular gas becomes optically thick against the thermal emission from the dust , which cools the molecular core , after the contraction proceeds and the central density reaches @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the gas becomes adiabatic beyond the density and the first core forms @xcite .",
    "hydrogen molecules ( h@xmath1 ) dissociate into atomic hydrogen ( h ) when its temperature reaches @xmath46k .",
    "typical density at which the temperature reaches @xmath47 is equal to @xmath48 .",

    "we adopted milucgs [ modified incomplete lu decomposition preconditioned conjugate gradient squared method : @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "the gravitational contraction proceeds in a significantly non - homologous way .",
    "thus , to see the late phase evolution , high spatial resolution is needed especially near the center .",
    "similarly to the previous papers @xcite , we adopt the nested grid method @xcite . in this method , a number of levels of grids with different spacings are prepared ; finer grids cover the central high - density portion and the coarser ones cover the cloud as a whole .",
    "the grids are named as l0 ( the coarsest ) , l1 , l2 ,  and the grid spacing of l@xmath71 is chosen equal to a half of that of l@xmath72 , that is , the grid spacings of l@xmath71 is equal to @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the l0 grid covers the region @xmath41 and @xmath75 .    in the nested grid method ,",
    "the boundary condition is applied to the outer boundary of the coarsest grid l0 , on which we adopted the fixed boundary condition at @xmath76 and the periodic boundary condition at @xmath77 .",
    "the code has been tested comparing the results obtained with and without the nested grid technique [ for detail see @xcite ] .",
    "the the most unstable growth rates of perturbations are slightly different ( @xmath78 ) : @xmath79 was attained at @xmath80 for without nested grid ( but using relatively large number of grid points 400@xmath81400 ) , but at @xmath82 in the calculation with the nested grid method .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact the eigen - mode of the most unstable mode is as wide as the whole size of the numerical box and this mode is captured better by a simple calculation with a large number of zones ( 400@xmath81400 ) rather than the l0 grid ( 64 @xmath81 64 ) of the present scheme .",
    "however , after the perturbation has grown to be non - linear , the growth rate agrees well .",
    "in model a , we calculated the evolution with @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "we summarized the adopted parameters in table [ table2 ] .",
    "similar to the _ non - rotational _ magnetized cloud [ see figs . 2b and 2c of @xcite ] , the cylindrical cloud fragments into prolate spheroidal shape whose wavelength is equal to @xmath87 .",
    "this prolate spheroidal shape coincides with the structure expected from the linear stability analysis by @xcite .",
    "next , this density enhanced region begins to contract along the major axis of the cylindrical cloud , since the magnetic fields are assumed to run parallelly to the major axis .",
    "finally it forms a contracting disk ( pseudo - disk ) perpendicular to the magnetic field lines [ fig .",
    "2d of @xcite ] . the snapshot at this stage is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "using the conversion factor shown in table[table1 ] , the epoch @xmath88 corresponds to @xmath89 from the beginning of calculation .",
    "respective panels of figure [ fig1 ] have different spatial coverage .",
    "figure [ fig1]a , which shows l1 , captures global structure of contracting disk extending horizontally which is perpendicular to the magnetic field lines . the spatial resolution of l1 is so limited that there seems no internal structures in the contracting disk . however , l5 which has 16 times finer resolution than l1 shows shock fronts facing outer directions extend parallel to the @xmath55-direction .",
    "fronts near @xmath90 are the fast - mode mhd shock front , because the magnetic fields bend toward the front passing the shock front .",
    "we can see another density jump near @xmath91 ( hereafter we will omit the sign @xmath92 and mention the upper half part of the figure since the structure is symmetric ) .",
    "the shock fronts parallel to the disk are known in non - magnetized rotating isothermal clouds @xcite .",
    "this is not due to the rotation ; multiple shock fronts are also found in the contracting magnetized cloud without rotation @xcite .",
    "however , situation becomes a bit complicated in this cloud . in the outer region @xmath93 ,",
    "the magnetic field lines run almost vertically ( @xmath94 and @xmath67 ) . passing the mhd fast shock , in the intermediate region ( @xmath95 ) ,",
    "the radial and toroidal components are amplified and the density increases compared to the outer region . finally after passing another front near @xmath96 , the toroidal component @xmath67 decreases .",
    "that is , since the magnetic field lines deflect departing from the front at the second front , this is the slow mhd shock .",
    "the density range captured in this panel is from @xmath97 to @xmath98 .",
    "it should be noticed that these shocks occurs in the isothermal gas .",
    "this phase is called `` run - away collapse , '' in which the central density ( @xmath99 ) increases greatly in a finite time - scale .",
    "figure [ fig1]c shows the structure captured by l10 . almost all the gas in this figure is isothermal .",
    "however , a central small part of the contracting disk @xmath100 and @xmath101 enters the adiabatic regime . at this stage",
    ", we can see another density jump is forming just outside the adiabatic part of the disk .",
    "it seems to grow into an accretion shock front , since it is known that an accretion shock forms outside the core when the adiabatic core develops @xcite .",
    "this is easily understood as follows : the adiabatic gas with specific heat ratio @xmath102 has a hydrostatic equilibrium irrespective of its mass .",
    "the scale - height in the @xmath54-direction of the core becomes larger than that of the disk .",
    "the adiabatic part of the contracting disk forms a spherical static core .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the cross - cut view along two axes ( panel a : along the disk mid - plane @xmath103 and panel b : along the @xmath54-axis @xmath23 ) .",
    "the lines with 0.6066 represent the stage shown in figure [ fig1 ] . at this stage ( @xmath88 ) , inflowing gas is almost isothermal ( @xmath104 ) . in figure [ fig2]a , the radial distributions of the density , the magnetic flux density , and",
    "the radial and toroidal components of velocity are shown .",
    "we can see that density and magnetic flux density distributions are approximately expressed by power - laws as @xmath105 and @xmath106 except for the central part . at @xmath107 , the density in the core exceeds @xmath108 . and at @xmath109 , it reaches @xmath110 . at this stage ,",
    "a radially outward - facing shock front is seen even inside the disk ; infall motion is abruptly decelerated and the density and magnetic flux density are amplified .",
    "this shows that a compact core is formed inside the accretion shock front .",
    "the central density increases with time and inside @xmath111 adiabatic gas ( @xmath112 ) distributes .",
    "the size of the core is equal to @xmath113 .",
    "this reduces with time since the mass of the core increases by the effect of continuous accretion .",
    "before the shock front is formed @xmath114 , the radial inflow velocity takes the maximum about @xmath115 near @xmath116 . for the larson - penston self - similar solution for the spherically symmetric dynamical collapse @xcite",
    ", this maximum inflow speed is expected equal to @xmath117 . on the other hand",
    ", it equals to @xmath118 for non - rotating isothermal _ disk _ @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is shown that the actual inflow speed ranges between the spherically symmetric self - similar solution and the axially symmetric thin disk solution .",
    "after the shock front is formed around the core , the inflow velocity takes the maximum just outside the shock front and the maximum speed increases with time .",
    "inflow motion is accelerated toward the shock front .",
    "similar acceleration is also seen in the toroidal velocity , @xmath11 . before the core formation the toroidal speed @xmath11 takes the maximum near @xmath119 .",
    "however , @xmath11 increases toward the accretion shock after core formation . at @xmath109",
    "it reaches @xmath120 ( see also fig.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "structure seen in the cross - cut along the @xmath54-axis is more complicated ( fig.[fig2]b ) .",
    "two shock fronts mentioned earlier ( fig.[fig1]b ) correspond to the jumps near @xmath121 and @xmath122-axis it is found near @xmath123 , while departing from the @xmath54-axis ( @xmath124 ) it is found near @xmath125 .",
    "] at @xmath88 , the density and the inflowing velocity distributions have no discontinuities besides these two shock fronts .",
    "however , at @xmath107 , the inflowing velocity distribution begins to indicate a clear discontinuity near @xmath126 .",
    "this is a newly formed shock front and propagate spatially . comparing two curves of @xmath107 and @xmath109",
    ", it is shown that this shock front breaks into two fronts and the inner one ( @xmath126 ) is standing still , while another outer one ( @xmath127 ) is propagating outwardly .",
    "these two shock fronts are outwardly facing .",
    "thus the inwardly propagation of the inner fronts is due to the infalling gas motion .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] illustrates the structure at @xmath128 .",
    "although the gas is inflowing both inside and outside of the disk at @xmath107 ( fig.[fig2 ] ) , at this stage @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) represents the time from the beginning of calculation but @xmath130 represents the time after the core formation .",
    "we assumed that the core consists of the gas with density @xmath112 . ]",
    "prominent outflow is formed .",
    "it is shown that the flow pattern is completely changed in @xmath131yr .",
    "outflow sweeps a sphere with radius of @xmath132 ( fig.[fig3]a ) .",
    "figure [ fig3]b indicates that the gas near the disk surface flows inwardly for @xmath133 .",
    "however , the direction of the flow is changed upwardly near @xmath134 . finally this gas is ejected . while the gas near the mid - plane of the disk ( @xmath135 ) continues to contract .",
    "this is reasonable because the total amount of angular momentum in one magnetic flux tube must be conserved in the axisymmetric ideal mhd simulation ; for the outflow gas to get angular momentum , a part of the gas in the same magnetic flux tube has to lose its angular momentum and falls further . in the acceleration process of the gas , the angular momentum is transferred from the gas near the mid - plane to the gas near the surface of the disk . considering the angular rotation speed ,",
    "the angular momentum is transferred from the fast - rotating mid - plane to the slowly rotating surface gas .    from figures [ fig1]c and [ fig3]a ( both show the structure captured by l10 )",
    ", we can see the magnetic field lines run completely differently comparing before ( @xmath136 : fig.[fig1]c ) and after ( @xmath137 : fig.[fig3]a ) the adiabatic core formation .",
    "that is , in the isothermal runaway collapse phase ( fig.[fig1]c ) the magnetic fields lines run vertically , in other words , perpendicularly to the disk . in contrast , after the adiabatic core is formed , the disk continues to contract and drags the magnetic field lines inwardly .",
    "thus the angle between the magnetic field lines and the disk decreases .",
    "figure [ fig3]b is a close - up view whose spatial resolution is 4-times finer than that of figure [ fig3]a .",
    "this panel shows us that the angle between the flow and the disk is about @xmath138 .",
    "the reason why the outflow begins after the core formation is related to the angle between the magnetic field lines and the disk , @xmath139 . @xcite have pointed out that for a cold gas rotating with the keplerian speed to get angular momentum from the keplerian disk via infinitely strong magnetic fields , @xmath139 must be smaller than a critical value @xmath140 .",
    "this is understood as follows : consider the gas on one magnetic flux tube .",
    "when the magnetic flux tube rising steeply from the disk as @xmath141 , the gas has to climb the effective potential well even if it rotates with the same angular speed of the keplerian disk . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath142 , gas can escape from the gravitational well by getting angular momentum from the disk , if the gas has the same angular speed of the keplerian disk .",
    "although the exact value of @xmath143 depends on the disk rotation speed and the disk - to - central star mass ratio , small angle is preferable to acceleration .",
    "it should be noted that this configuration is achieved only after the core formation @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig3]c shows the ratio of the toroidal magnetic component to poloidal one by contour lines , which is overlaid on the magnetic field lines . since the toroidal - to - poloidal ratio is as small as @xmath144 in the disk , the disk is poloidal - dominated .",
    "however , in the region where the gas flows outwardly the toroidal component grows and the toroidal - to - poloidal ratio reaches @xmath145 .",
    "the outflow gas is toroidal - field - dominated .",
    "the coincidence of acceleration region with the toroidal - dominant region seems to indicate that the toroidal fields play an important role to accelerate the gas .",
    "the toroidal component of the lorentz force , @xmath146 works below this toroidal - dominant region , that is , @xmath147 .",
    "this toroidal component @xmath148 accelerates the toroidal velocity @xmath11 and resultant toroidal motion amplifies the toroidal component of the magnetic fields .",
    "outflow speed exceeds the sound speed and the fastest speed reaches @xmath149 at this time .",
    "it increases with time .",
    "although the outflow seems to continue , the further evolution is hard to study , because the time - scale ( the free - fall time - scale at the central core ) becomes shorter and shorter .",
    "therefore , we study model ah with a constant polytropic index larger than that of model a. in models ah1 ( fig.[fig4]a ) and ah2 ( fig.[fig4]b ) , the polytropic indices are chosen @xmath150 and @xmath151 , respectively , for @xmath112 .",
    "( models whose name have `` h '' have simple polytropic relation with @xmath150 or @xmath151 for @xmath112 . ) due to the hard polytropic index , the size of the adiabatic core , whose surface is determined by the jump in @xmath152 , becomes large ; for example at @xmath128 the size is equal to @xmath153 for model ah1 and @xmath154 for model ah2 while it is @xmath155 for model a. similar to model a , just outside the core , outflow begins to be accelerated .",
    "the region which the outflow sweeps expands and the surface which separates inflow and outflow forms another mhd shock front . and the expansion of the front is very similar to that of model a ( the front reaches @xmath156 at this time which is similar to model a ) .    to see the similarity in more detail",
    ", we calculated the mass of the core @xmath157 for models a , ah1 , and ah2 .",
    "these are equal to @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 at the time @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) for models a , ah1 and ah2 , respectively . at later epoch @xmath161 ( @xmath162yr ) , @xmath163 ( model ah1 ) and @xmath164 ( model ah2 ) . from these results",
    ", it is shown that the core mass increases with time due to the continuous accretion and the mass does not depend on the exact equation of state in the core .",
    "this is understood as follows : the core mass is determined by the accretion rate of the _ isothermal gas _ which is independent from the polytropic @xmath165 in the core .",
    "the gravity by the core has an effect on the outer inflow and outflow .",
    "since the effect depends only on its mass , the difference of the polytropic index of the core does not play an important role for the inflow and outflow .",
    "therefore , we will study this model ah to see the long time evolution of the outflow .    in figure [ fig4]c ,",
    "the snapshot at @xmath166 ( @xmath167 ) is plotted for model ah1 . comparing this with figure [ fig1]b for model a ( both have the same resolution but for different epochs )",
    ", it is shown that the shock front which separates the inflow and the outflow passed the slow - mode mhd shock near @xmath168 and has just reached the outer fast - mode shock front near @xmath169 .",
    "the evolution of model ah2 is essentially the same . the maximum speed of the outflow reaches @xmath170 .",
    "this maximum speed seems smaller than that observed in the molecular outflow .",
    "since the mass accumulated in the core is only equal to @xmath171 , the outflow speed seems to be much faster than this value , when the mass has grown to typical t tauri stars .",
    "figure [ fig3]b indicates the outflow is accelerated near the core and the opening angle of the outflow in this region is wide .",
    "however , departing from the acceleration region the flow changes its direction toward the @xmath54-axis .",
    "figure [ fig4]c show that the opening angle decreases as the outflow proceeds .",
    "this indicates the flow is collimated .      to see the effect of the initial rotation speed , we compare models ah1 ( @xmath172 ) , bh ( @xmath173 ) , and ch ( @xmath174 ) .",
    "these models have the same magnetic field strength , @xmath175 . in figure [ fig5 ] panels ( a - c ) ,",
    "the structures at the final epoch of the isothermal run - away collapse phase are plotted for respective models .",

    ", it is shown that model ah1",
    "( fig.[fig6]d ) forms a bit more collimated outflow than models bh and ch ( fig.[fig6]e and f ) .",

    "further , the opening angle of the magnetic field lines in models bh and ch is larger than that of model ah1 .",
    "this causes the flow also open .",
    "difference between models bh and ch comes from the fact that the epochs when the outflow begins are different . since the initial angular momentum in model bh is five - times larger than that of model ch , in model bh the outflow begins earlier than model ch . at @xmath182 , however , even in model ch the top of the outflow reaches @xmath169 and the structure looks very similar to model bh at @xmath183 ( fig.[fig5]e ) .    at the epoch when figure [ fig5]d - f is taken ( @xmath184^{-1/2}$ ] ) , the mass in the adiabatic core reaches @xmath185 ( model ah1 ) , @xmath186 ( model bh ) , and @xmath187 ( model ch ) .",
    "the instantaneous rate of mass accretion to the adiabatic core for each model attains @xmath188 ( model ah1 ) , @xmath189 ( model bh ) , and @xmath190 ( model ch ) , respectively .",

    "therefore , the accretion rates calculated here are @xmath192 times larger than that expected by the inside - out collapse model .",
    "consider the reason why the mass of the core decreases with increasing @xmath181 .",
    "since the gas is supplied to the core mainly through the disk , we will consider the mass inflow / outflow transported in the disk . at that time",
    ", the gas disk can be divided into three regions .",
    "outermost region is occupied with isothermal gas and the gas is contracting or inflowing ( pseudo - disk ) .",
    "therefore the inflow mass rate @xmath193 and the outflow mass rate @xmath194 in this outermost region . inside of this region ,",
    "outflow is generated , although a large part of the gas is still inflowing .",
    "therefore in this middle region , the inflow rate is smaller than that of the outermost region , @xmath195 , and the excess mass is transported to the outflow , @xmath196 .",
    "innermost is the adiabatic core . since the mass accretion rate to the core is equal to the net mass inflow rate from the middle region , @xmath197 .",
    "mass inflow driven by the self - gravity is more important in a model with small @xmath181 in which the self - gravity is ineffectively counterbalanced with the centrifugal force . therefore @xmath198 becomes larger for slow rotator .",
    "this is the first effect of the rotation .",
    "furthermore , the outflow brings away appreciable amount of gas .",
    "as mentioned previously , the outflow is strongly generated in the fast rotator .",
    "thus , the mass outflow rate increases with increasing @xmath181 as @xmath199 ( model ah1 ) , @xmath200 ( model bh ) , and @xmath201 ( model ch ) . as a result , increasing @xmath181 , the portion of outflow gas to the inflow gas @xmath202 becomes large as @xmath203 40% for model ah1 , @xmath203 10% for model bh , and @xmath204 5% for model ch .",
    "these two effects works cooperatively to reduce the mass accretion rate @xmath205 to the core for the cloud with a large @xmath181 .",
    "the maximum outflow speed realized in respective figures are equal to @xmath206 ( model ah1 ) , @xmath207 ( model bh ) , and @xmath208 ( model ch ) .",
    "since the outflow is accelerated by the toroidal magnetic fields which are generated by the rotation motion , this @xmath209 increases with increasing @xmath181 .    as shown in @xcite , since the excess angular momentum of the inflowing gas",
    "is effectively removed by the outflow , the total angular momentum of the first core which is defined as a gas with @xmath112 is equal to @xmath210 contained in the mass of @xmath211 ( model ah1 ) , @xmath212 in @xmath213 ( model bh ) , and @xmath214 in @xmath215 ( model ch ) .",
    "the total angular momenta contained in the first cores are only 1.1% , 0.07% , and 0.9% of the initial ones contained in respective mass @xmath216 .      to see the effect of the magnetic field strength , we calculated models nh , dh and eh in which we took @xmath217 , @xmath218 , and @xmath219 .",
    "model nh has no magnetic fields . in figure",
    "[ fig6]a , a snapshot at @xmath220 captured by l8 is shown for model nh . at this stage , whole the cloud is in isothermal regime and the disk experiences the run - away collapse even if the centrifugal force may work to support the cloud .",
    "this confirms the earlier studies by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the physical reason why the centrifugal force does not stop the contraction in the isothermal run - away collapse phase is explained in @xcite as follows : due to the the centrifugal force , the mass contained in the jeans scale ( @xmath221 ) from the center is _ decreasing _ throughout the collapse . in this sense",
    "the centrifugal force does work !",
    "only small part of the mass that resides near the center becomes high - density .",
    "but contraction itself continues and the central density rises greatly in a finite time - scale , if the isothermal equation of state is valid .",
    "similar to the previous magnetized models , a small adiabatic core is formed first . since there is no magnetic fields , magnetic braking does not work , however , in this model .",
    "therefore , gas that accretes on the core has relatively large angular momentum in contrast to the magnetized model . as a result , a ring forms by the gas which accreted on the adiabatic core .",
    "since the specific angular momentum , @xmath222 , increases further with time , radius of the ring grows .",

    "figure [ fig7]d which shows the structure near the root of outflow indicates that it is very similar to that of model ah1 .",

    "time @xmath228 is equivalent to @xmath229 .",
    "it is concluded that in a time - scale of @xmath230 , the flow pattern is completely changed from the run - away collapse to the outflow plus continuous inflow in the disk .",

    "the masses accumulated in @xmath238 are equal to @xmath239 for model bh , @xmath240 for model dh , and @xmath241 for model eh .",
    "this shows that the mass accretion rate , @xmath242 , is an increasing function of the initial magnetic field strength , @xmath175 .",
    "this seems strange if we remember @xmath242 is an decreasing function of the initial rotation speed , @xmath181 , since both @xmath175 and @xmath181 have an effect to counterbalance against the self - gravity .",

    "this seems to come from a number of reasons , that is , the initial cylindrical cloud becomes massive with increasing @xmath175 .",

    "in the previous section , we introduced a simple polytrope above the critical density @xmath112 except for model a. however , this is an approximation to see a long evolution . in reality",

    ", we used the composite polytrope to include the combined effects such as the dynamical compressional heating , the radiative cooling through the dust thermal emissions , and the energy loss associated with the h@xmath1 dissociation .",

    "[ fig8]a , we plotted the structure captured by l6 just before the first core formation @xmath251 .",

    "the size of the second core is equal to @xmath262 .",
    "this meets a similar situation when the first adiabatic core is formed , that is , a central part of the gas obeys a harder equation of state and forms a quasistatic core , while the outer part obeys a softer equation of state and continues to collapse .",

    "this is a snapshot of l16 at @xmath263 ( @xmath264 ) , which resembles the structure seen in figure [ fig3]b .",
    "this model strongly indicates us that there is another kind of outflow accelerated around the second core ( the second outflow ) besides that formed around the first core ( the first outflow ) .",
    "the outflow speed , @xmath265 , is much faster than that of the first outflow , due to the fast thermal speed in the adiabatic core and the deep local gravitational potential .",
    "since the time span of the simulation shown here is restricted , we can not trace the evolution further .",
    "however , the simulation predicts that at least two different outflows are formed each of which is related to different types of adiabatic cores .",
    "since the flow speed of the second outflow is much faster than that of the first outflow , the respective outflows correspond to the molecular bipolar outflow ( the first outflow ) and the fast neutral wind or optical jets ( the second outflow ) .",
    "the radial size of the outflow is approximately equal to @xmath266 ( = 0.14 au or @xmath267 ) .",

    "however , the ionization fraction of high - density gas is quite low and the electric conductivity decreases as collapse proceeds .",
    "calculation of ionization equilibrium @xcite shows us that after @xmath268 charged grains are more abundant than ions , as a carrier of electric charges . since the mass - to - charge ratio of grains is much larger than that of ions , the electric conductivity decrease greatly and the magnetic field decays mainly through joule dissipation .",
    "therefore , in the late phase of the first core ( quasistatic contraction ) , the magnetic field in the core decreases its strength till the field configuration becomes force - free . after the dissociation of h@xmath1 begins",
    ", the temperature of the central region is enough high to achieve the thermal ionization of metals .",
    "thus , in the second collapse phase , coupling of magnetic fields is recovered . from these ,",
    "the ideal mhd is consistent in the first and the second collapse phases .",
    "however , the magnetic flux density at the beginning of the second collapse phases seems to be much weaker than that obtained here .",

    "<S> collapse of the rotating magnetized molecular cloud core is studied with the axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations . due to the change of the equation of state of the interstellar gas , the molecular cloud cores experience several different phases as collapse proceeds . in the isothermal run - away collapse ( @xmath0 ) </S>",
    "<S> , a pseudo - disk is formed and it continues to contract till the opaque core is formed at the center . in this disk , </S>",
    "<S> a number of mhd fast and slow shock pairs appear running parallelly to the disk . </S>",
    "<S> after the equation of state becomes hard , an adiabatic core is formed , which is separated from the isothermal contracting pseudo - disk by the accretion shock front facing radially outwards . by the effect of the magnetic tension </S>",
    "<S> , the angular momentum is transferred from the disk mid - plane to the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the gas with excess angular momentum near the surface is finally ejected , which explains the molecular bipolar outflow . </S>",
    "<S> two types of outflows are observed . </S>",
    "<S> when the poloidal magnetic field is strong ( magnetic energy is comparable to the thermal one ) , a u - shaped outflow is formed in which fast moving gas is confined to the wall whose shape looks like a capital letter u. the other is the turbulent outflow in which magnetic field lines and velocity fields are randomly oriented . in this case , turbulent gas moves out almost perpendicularly from the disk . </S>",
    "<S> the continuous mass accretion leads to the quasistatic contraction of the first core . a second collapse due to dissociation of h@xmath1 in the first core follows . </S>",
    "<S> finally another quasistatic core is again formed by atomic hydrogen ( the second core ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that another outflow is ejected around the second atomic core , which seems to correspond to the optical jets or the fast neutral winds . </S>"
