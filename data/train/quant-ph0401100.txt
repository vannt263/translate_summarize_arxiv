    "quantum computers have been expected to posses more computational ability over conventional computers .",
    "shor s factorization algorithm@xcite , for example , has proved the power of quantum computation , which resolves a composite number @xmath0 ( @xmath1 bits long ) into the prime factors in the polynomial time of @xmath1 , whereas all the known classical algorithms require exponential resources .",
    "the factorization problem is also important from a practical point of view , because efficient algorithms can break the rsa public - key cryptosystem .",
    "although shor s algorithm and its related algorithms are well established in theory , practical implementations of them are still in their infancy .",
    "so far , only an nmr - based computer has demonstrated the factorization of 15 ( @xmath2 ) with seven qubits@xcite . until now",
    ", it has been difficult to see how one could increase the number of qubits to solve problems of practical significance , such as breaking the rsa public - key cryptosystem .",
    "one of the main obstacles to realize large scale quantum computers is errors in gate operations due to decoherence .",
    "theory of fault - tolerant quantum computation@xcite shows that arbitrary - length error - free computation can proceed with only a polynomial overhead in time and space , so long as the error probability per fundamental operation is kept below a threshold value .",
    "typical predicted values are in 10@xmath3 to 10@xmath4 , which depend on the product of qubits and gate operations required in the computation , and on the model of decoherence@xcite .",
    "these threshold values are still too low for the present technology , so that it is desirable to reduce the requirement in the scale of quantum computation .",
    "recently , beauregard@xcite showed that @xmath5 qubits are enough to perform shor s algorithm .",
    "he used quantum fourier transform ( qft ) for modular exponentiation , and a qft followed by measurement ( we will refer it to mqft after measured quantum fourier transform ) on the control qubit@xcite .",
    "it would be remarkable that mqft is fault - tolerant@xcite , so that the above scheme not only reduces the    number of qubits but also provides robustness against decoherence .",
    "one of the main issues in implementing quantum information technology is selection of quanta to carry the information . among a number of the implementation proposals",
    ", photons have played an important role from the beginning of the practical proposal on quantum information technology .",
    "photons have advantages to implement qubits : su(2 ) space easily implemented by polarization , very weak coupling to the environment , and existing single photon measurement technique .",
    "moreover , we can utilize fruit of extensive research and development efforts of the optical communication industry .",
    "commercially available fiber - optic devices enable us to construct efficient quantum circuits that consist of one - qubit operations ( including classically controlled gates ) with a reasonable cost .",
    "fiber - optics resolves the mode matching problems in conventional optics , and provides mechanically stable optical circuits",
    ". it would be worth exploring feasibility of the quantum information processing based on fiber - optics . in this article",
    ", we show an implementation of the mqft on a circuit built up with commercially available fiber - optic devices . we have achieved error - free mqft operation on 1024 qubits , despite the imperfections in the actual devices .",
    "this shows that photonic devices are suitable to process quantum information .    in the rest of the article",
    ", we will report the mqft experiment in detail .",
    "we will review the qft and mqft used in the phase estimation algorithm in section 2 .",
    "the implementation of mqft with fiber - optics devices will be given in section 3 .",
    "we will also show successful result on mqft over 255 qubits and 1024 qubits . in section 4",
    ", we will consider effects of the imperfections in the experimental apparatus , and show the validity of the majority voting by repeated measurements .",
    "we will also discuss a direction toward making quantum computers expanding the present mqft implementation .",
    "the heart of the factorization and related quantum algorithms lies in the phase estimation algorithm@xcite that consists of controlled - unitary operations ( c-@xmath6 s ) and mqft on the control qubits .",
    "the phase estimation problem is given as follows : an eigenvalue of a unitary transform @xmath6 defines a phase @xmath7 as @xmath8   \\left\\vert u\\right\\rangle $ ] .",
    "our task is to determine the phase expressed in @xmath9 bits by @xmath10 .",
    "when the target qubit state is provided by the eigenstate @xmath11 of the unitary transform @xmath6 , the states after controlled-@xmath12 according to the superposition of all the possible control qubit state @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 the inverse fourier transform performs the transform @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes a state which provide a good estimation of @xmath7 when we measure the control qubits . in short",
    ", the controlled-@xmath12 provides an unknown phase according to the problem .",
    "mqft then determines the phase to find the solution . though a text book@xcite shows qft implemented by a quantum circuit of hadamard gates and controlled rotation gates as in fig .",
    "[ figure1](a ) , an alternative form of the mqft circuit was constructed with only one - qubit gates as in fig .",
    "[ figure1](b)@xcite .",
    "this is based on the fact that c-@xmath6 s commute with measurements when the control qubits are measured in the computational basis .",
    "we can thus replace the controlled - unitary gates with unitary gates controlled classically by the results of the measurements@xcite .",
    "since the latter devices act on only the target qubit , they are much easier to realize than two - qubit gates . though griffiths and niu described their circuit as semiclassical@xcite , it is worth to point out that the circuit is fully equivalent to the quantum circuit constructed with controlled - rotation gates .",
    "parker and plenio@xcite found that the phase estimation using mqft can be operated qubit by qubit with only one rotation at a time , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1](c ) .",
    "this reflects the fact that the rhs of ( [ cus ] ) can be rewritten by a product form as @xmath17 the circuit operates on the target qubits , which are in an eigenstate of @xmath6 , with one control qubit at each step . in some applications , however , it is not easy to find the eigenstates ( if we know an eigenstate , the problem is already solved . )",
    "then , instead of using an eigenstate , we can start with a superposition of the eigenstates : @xmath18 we observe @xmath19 in order - finding algorithm@xcite .",
    "the phase estimation algorithm proceeds qubit by qubit as follows . in the first step , the c-@xmath20 with respect to the first control qubit @xmath21 transforms the initial state to an entangled state@xmath22   \\left\\vert 1\\right\\rangle \\right )   c_{s}\\left\\vert u_{s}\\right\\rangle , \\label{cu1}%\\ ] ] where we use @xmath23=% \\exp\\left [ \\pi i\\ , \\varphi_{n}\\right]$ ] . here",

    "the former consists of the eigenstates belonging to the eigenvalues @xmath30 , and the latter consists of those belonging to the eigenvalues @xmath31 , where the bit values @xmath32 are arbitrary at this step . in the @xmath33 th step , c-@xmath34 provides the state@xmath35 \\left\\vert 1\\right\\rangle \\right ) c_{s}\\left\\vert u_{s}\\right\\rangle \\label{cuk}%\\ ] ] the control qubit state is reduced to @xmath36\\left\\vert 1\\right\\rangle \\right )   $ ] by applying the classically controlled rotation @xmath37 defined by@xmath38 \\end{pmatrix } , \\label{rotation}%\\ ] ] where the rotation angle @xmath39 is determined from the bit values obtained in the previous measurements , _ i.e._,@xmath40 measurement of the control qubit in the computational basis after hadamard transform again yields a deterministic value of @xmath41 . continuing the operation steps bit by bit",
    "will provide all the bit values of @xmath7 with probability proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "the target qubit states collapse to one of the binary branches according to the measurement result , and thus the number of possible target qubit states is reduced at each step .",

    "qubits are represented by the single photon polarization states , where the @xmath24 and @xmath25 states are defined to be horizontally polarized and vertically polarized , respectively .",
    "a sequence of single photon pulses enters the quantum circuit .",
    "the input photons are generally elliptically polarized according to the bit values of the phase @xmath43 between the basis states ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) to simulate the output of the c-@xmath6 s as shown in ( [ product - state ] ) .",
    "the key device of the mqft circuit is the rotation gate , which is implemented as an interferometer constructed with polarization beam splitters ( pbs ) and a phase modulator ( pm ) .",
    "the pbs1 divides the states according to the polarizations , and the pm provides a relative phase shift given by ( [ rotation ] ) to the @xmath44 state .",
    "the two polarizations are combined again by the pbs2 , and the polarization state is analyzed by a half wave plate ( hwp ) and a pbs .",
    "the hwp provides phase difference between the polarization .",
    "when its axis is tilted 22.5 deg , hwp transforms @xmath45 and @xmath46 , thus acts as a hadamard gate .",
    "the accuracy of the phase shift is determined by the precision of the electric pulse applied to the pm . in most pulse generators , the precision is limited to three digits , _",
    "i.e. _ , 8 - 10 bits .",

    "the interferometer in fig .",
    "[ figure2](a ) will work in principle , however , is sensitive to disturbance in practice .",
    "we employed a fiber loop configuration often referred to a sagnac interferometer as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2](b ) , where orthogonally polarized photons propagate in opposite directions through the same fiber .",
    "the two basis states are subject to the same additional phase fluctuation , so that the present mqft circuit is robust to disturbances . the fiber - loop rotation gate consisted of a circulator , a polarization controller ( pc ) , a pbs , a pm , and polarization maintaining fiber ( pmf ) .",
    "the circulator is a unidirectional device that allows light propagation only in the @xmath49 and @xmath50 direction . before entering the pbs",
    ", photons were passed through pc1 to compensate for the unintentional polarization rotation due to the birefringence in the fiber .",
    "the photons were divided by pbs1 .",
    "the output ports of the pbs1 were both aligned to the slow axis of the pmf .",
    "the horizontally polarized @xmath51 state propagated in the clockwise ( cw ) direction and the vertically polarized @xmath25 state in the counter clockwise ( ccw ) direction . note that the pbs converts the polarizations into the directions of the propagation , and that the qubits were represented by cw and ccw pulses with the same polarization in the fiber - loop .",
    "the pm was placed at an asymmetric position in the fiber loop to provide the relative phase .",
    "the cw pulses entered the pm earlier than the ccw pulses for 20 ns in the present setting .",
    "the arrival time of the cw pulses was synchronized with the electric pulses to the pm , so that only the photons in the @xmath25 state were subject to the phase modulation . to provide accurate phase shifts ,",
    "the electric pulse should be shorter than the difference of the arrival time .",
    "the present circuit worked with the electric pulses of 10 ns duration .",
    "we used a high - speed linbo@xmath52 pm designed for 10 gb / s operation .",
    "the cw and ccw pulses were combined by pbs1 , and went back to the circulator .",
    "qubits were again represented by polarizations after pbs1 .",
    "pc2 compensated the birefringence but also provided hadamard transformation .",
    "this was possible because pcs creates a fixed but arbitrary phase difference between two orthogonal polarizations , the axis of which can be set also at an arbitrary angle .",
    "the polarizations of the output photons from the circulator were analyzed by pbs2 .",
    "photons were detected by a photon detector .",
    "the photon detector was made of balanced ingaas avalanche photodiodes cooled to 173 k to reduce the dark counts@xcite .",
    "we obtained the dark count rate at 6 - 7@xmath5310@xmath54 per pulse with the detection efficiency of 13 % .",
    "the optical loss in the circuit ( 8.4 db ) came mainly from the insertion loss of the pm ( 6 db ) .",

    "the pulse duration was about 30 ps .",
    "the light pulses were then attenuated to 0.7 photons / pulse to ensure that the present circuit worked with a single photon .",

    "visibility of the interferometer was 98 % , which was determined mainly by the extinction ratio of the pbs .",

    "in the following , we consider effects of the imperfection of experimental apparatus .",
    "two types of failure may occur .",
    "one is failure in photon detection , the other is error in the measurement . if a pulse contains no photons , the operation will not affect the target qubits .",
    "we can thus continue the calculation by repeating the operation step .",
    "if a photon is lost in the mqft circuit , it means that the c-@xmath6 and measurement have been done without knowing the result .",
    "therefore , the target states will be in a mixed state corresponding to the two possible outcome . even in this case",
    ", we can proceed the calculation by repeating the same operation step .",
    "the repeated measurement will reduce the target qubit state into a pure state by selecting one of the possibilities .",

    "the phase error originates from the approximation in the rotation angle @xmath39 and from errors in converting the rotation angle into the drive voltage to the pm .",

    "the truncation at the @xmath47th bit results in the phase error@xmath89 the phase error should not be significant@xcite , because the contribution from the @xmath90th bit ( @xmath91 ) decreases with the factor of @xmath92 .",
    "the worst values of @xmath93 obtained in the experiment corresponds to a phase error of @xmath94 , which agrees quite well with the prediction by ( [ phaseerror ] ) with @xmath47=5 .",

    "for example , the error probability per operation @xmath78 and accumulation @xmath114 yield the error probability @xmath115 , which agrees with the value obtained from the experiment on 1024 qubits .",
    "the main drawback of the mqft is time , because it operates serially .",
    "the response time of the current circuit is limited by electronics .",
    "we may expect the response time to be reduced to several nanoseconds .",
    "if the operation time is decreased to 1 ns , the target qubits should remain coherent for at least 10 @xmath56s to complete controlled - unitary operations with a thousand control qubits ( 1 ns @xmath53 1000 qubits @xmath53 10 accumulations . )",

    "it can exploit fairly large interaction between atomic qubits to obtain two qubit gates .",
    "measurement on photonic control qubit will resolve the read - out problem .",
    "another possibility is to combine with the linear - optics gates proposed by knill , laflamme , and milburn@xcite . since the klm scheme utilizes single photon states , it suits well to the present mqft circuit .",
    "the present mqft circuit may find its applications on such as finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors@xcite and clock synchronization@xcite in the near future . in these applications , fewer controlled - unitary operations are enough to achive a meaningful task than those required in the factorization algorithm .",
    "we have shown successful mqft using single photon by the use of commercially available fiber optic devices .",
    "the mqft is robust to errors as suggested .",
    "we have also shown that decision by majority is simple to implement and is useful to reduce error probability . our implementation can be used in the final part of the order - finding algorithm . in other words ,",
    "the easier part of the factorization algorithm is ready .",
