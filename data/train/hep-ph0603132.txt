    "radiative corrections ( rc ) to elastic ( inelastic ) electron - proton ( @xmath2 ) scattering cross sections can be classified in two types , according to the reaction mechanism which is assumed : one where a virtual photon is exchanged between electron and proton and a second one taking into account the two virtual photon exchange amplitude , arising from box - type feynman diagrams in the lowest order of perturbation theory ( pt ) . both kinds of contributions to rc were considered in the literature , in detail , at the lowest order of pt for polarized and unpolarized cases .",
    "the most elaborated consideration at the lowest order of pt was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the approaches of previous papers ( cf . the reference list in @xcite ) were considerably improved .",
    "the role of higher orders of pt was firstly considered for the unpolarized case in the limit of hard photon emission in ref .",
    "@xcite and later for polarized case in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the elastic @xmath2 cross section decreases very rapidly with the momentum transfer squared , @xmath3 , proportionally to @xmath4 .",
    "the size of rc essentially depends on how the experiment was performed .",
    "for example , in experiments where only the angle of the scattered electron is measured , the initial electron emission can induce an enhancement of rc due to decreasing of @xmath5 .",
    "initial and final lepton emission can be taken into account by writing the cross section in form of cross section of drell - yan process where the structure functions of the electron ( sfs ) play the role of probability distributions @xcite .",
    "the set of sfs obey the renormalization group equations ( lipatov s equations ) .",
    "their solutions are well known @xcite . the formalism of sfs allows one to obtain the cross section in the so called \" leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) i.e. taking correctly into account the terms of the order @xmath6^n$ ] .",
    "it corresponds to collinear kinematics , where the photon is emitted in a direction close to the direction of the electron .",
    "knowing the value of rc in the lowest order of pt , the non - leading contribution @xmath7^n$ ] can be calculated",
    ".    a different source of enhancement of cross section is related to the so called weizsacker - williams kinematics , where photons are emitted in non - collinear kinematics , and provide almost zero momentum @xmath8 .",
    "this is not discussed in the present work .",
    "a possible enhancement of the elastic cross section can be associated with the box type feynman diagram , when the momentum squared is equally shared between the two photons .",
    "the relative contribution of two photon exchange , from simple counting in @xmath9 , would be of the order of the fine structure constant , @xmath10 : any contribution of the two - photon exchange ( through its interference with the one - photon mechanism ) would not exceed @xmath11 . but",
    "long ago it was observed @xcite that the simple rule of @xmath9-counting for the estimation of the relative role of two - photon contribution to the amplitude of elastic electron hadron scattering does not hold at large momentum transfer . using a glauber approach for the calculation of multiple scattering contributions @xcite",
    ", it appeared that the relative role of two - photon exchange can increase significantly in the region of high momentum transfer , due to the rapid decreasing of proton form factors(ffs ) in the case of proton intermediate state .",
    "the relevant quantity is the square of the ffs , calculated at @xmath12 and it can at least partially compensate the factor of @xmath9 . a similar effect takes place when the @xmath13 resonance is present in the intermediate state of the box diagram , because the transition in the vertex @xmath14 shows also a rapid decreasing with @xmath5 @xcite .    taking a simple model for nucleon form factors , based on the dipole parametrization : @xmath15 when both exchanged photons have momenta close to @xmath16",
    ", an enhancement factor appears in the loop calculation : the ratio of ffs in born and box - type amplitudes .",
    "this specific kinematics differs from the `` one soft photon '' approach used in the past , ref .",
    "@xcite , when considering the box diagram .",
    "recently , the interest in the @xmath17 contribution was revived as a possible explanation of the discrepancy among experimental data on elastic @xmath18 scattering @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic proton form factors show a different behavior as a function of @xmath5 , when measured with two different methods : the polarization transfer method @xcite , which allows a precise measurement of the ratio of the electric to magnetic proton form factors @xcite and the rosenbluth separation , from unpolarized elastic @xmath2 cross section @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was noted that the reason of the discrepancy lies in the slope of the reduced cross section as a function of @xmath19 , the virtual photon polarization . at the kinematics of the present experiments , radiative corrections on the cross section can reach up to @xmath20 , and affect very strongly this slope , changing even its sign , when @xmath21 gev@xmath22 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was claimed that the presence of the two photon contribution can bring in agreement the data on the proton electromagnetic form factors from polarization transfer and the rosenbluth methods .",
    "however , the kinematical properties related to fast decreasing ffs were not investigated in detail , as well as the possible presence of inelastic contributions in the intermediate state .",
    "a possible test of the model dependence of the calculation with an exactly solvable qed result is also absent .    on the other hand , ref .",
    "@xcite is very detailed .",
    "the sfs method was applied to transferred polarization experiments .",
    "the size of this effect was an order of magnitude too small to bring the polarization data in agreement with the unpolarized ones .",
    "therefore the conclusion of that paper was that one could not solve the discrepancy among the existing data .",
    "the sf method was also applied to polarization observables in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that the corrections can become very large , if one takes into account the initial state photon emission .",
    "however the corresponding kinematical region is usually rejected in the experimental analysis , by appropriate selection on the scattered electron energy .",
    "the motivation of the present paper is the stress the need for present experiments to go beyond the lowest order of pt , using leading logarithmic approximation and beyond .",
    "rc traditionally applied are proportional to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the laboratory beam energy , @xmath25 the momentum transfer squared and @xmath26 is the maximum energy of the undetected photon . in recent experiments",
    "@xmath24 is large and the experimental resolution is very good ( allowing to reduce @xmath26 ) .",
    "therefore this term becomes sizeable and one can not safely neglect higher order corrections .",
    "a complete calculation of radiative corrections should take into account consistently all different terms which contribute at all orders ( including the two photon exchange contribution ) and their interference .",
    "we derive an expression of the radiative corrected cross section for @xmath2 elastic scattering , in both polarized and non - polarized cases , which is easy to handle for experimentalists and which has a sufficient accuracy .",
    "we will show firstly that the @xmath27 problem can be solved by taking into account initial state emission , in sf approach , and , secondly , that the @xmath17 exchange mechanism is irrelevant for the solution of this problem .",

    "this assumption holds in the limit of a specific kinematics which emphasizes the role of the two photon contribution , at large @xmath5 .",
    "the present results are consistent with a rigorous qed calculation of the @xmath17 contribution from ref .",
    "@xcite , where the process @xmath157 and the crossed process were calculated and shown to be of the order of 1% . the qed case can be considered as an upper limit for @xmath17 effects in electron proton scattering , due to two reasons , at least : the proton electromagnetic ffs @xmath158 and @xmath159 are smaller than unity . moreover the contributions of the elastic and inelastic channels , in the intermediate state , should compensate . this has already been pointed out in the literature @xcite .",
    "we underline that the @xmath1 resonance contribution should be considered as a model for all possible intermediate states , including @xmath160 , @xmath161 ... using the analytical properties of the compton scattering amplitude @xcite , one can espect a large cancellation of the elastic intermediate state ( nucleon ) and inelastic ones up to a level of 10% .",
    "a complete evaluation of the box diagram for @xmath2 elastic scattering , in framework of an analytical model is in preparation @xcite .",
    "the main effect of the present calculation of rc is visible on the unpolarized cross section : it changes noticeably the slope of the @xmath19 dependence of the reduced cross section , in comparison with the born approximation .",
    "this slope is directly related to the electric form factor , therefore applying rc as suggested here to the unpolarized cross section , would solve the discrepancy between form factors extracted from the rosenbluth method and from the recoil polarization method .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the corrections on the polarization observables can be very large , if the cut parameter is small , see fig .",
    "[ fig : figy ] .",
    "this is due to the initial state photon emission , which is normally excluded in the experimental analysis . in this paper",
    "we considered the region near the elastic peak where the contribution to polarized cross section ratio becomes small ( of order 1 % , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] ) .",
    "an average sf correction was applied to the data , and significantly improves the consistency of the different sets . however , as pointed out in @xcite , this procedure , is still applied as a global factor depending on the relevant variables , @xmath19 and @xmath5 and does not solve the problem of the strong correlation between the parameters of the rosenbluth fit .",
    "an event by event analysis , based on sf method , should be done at the data processing level .",
    "this is outside the purpose of this paper .    in conclusion",
    ", the sf method can be successfully applied to calculate rc to elastic @xmath2 scattering . in particular , it takes precisely into account collinear photon emission .",
    "the two photon contribution is negligible in the considered kinematical range .",
    "the correction to the ratio of longitudinal to transverse proton polarization is small .",
    "but the correction on the unpolarized cross section has the effect and the size required to solve the discrepancy among proton form factors .",
    "the authors are thankful to s. dubnicka for careful reading of the manuscript and valuable discussions .",
    "one of us ( e. a. k. ) is grateful to the institute of physics , slovak academy of sciences , bratislava for warm hospitality and to dapnia / sphn , saclay , where part of this work was done .",
    "let us consider the integral @xmath163 the partition function @xmath164 has a @xmath165-type behavior for @xmath166 and has the following properties : @xmath167 therefore eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqa2 ] ) becomes : @xmath168    after elementary integration , eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqa2a ] ) becomes : @xmath169 + \\phi(1 ) \\left [ 1-\\displaystyle\\frac{\\beta}{4}\\int_0^{1-\\epsilon}dx\\displaystyle\\frac{1+x^2}{1-x } \\right ] \\label{eq : eqa5}\\\\ & = & \\phi(1)\\left [ 1-\\displaystyle\\frac{\\beta}{4}\\left ( 2\\ln \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{1-x_0}-x_0-\\displaystyle\\frac{x_0 ^ 2}{2}\\right ) \\right ] + \\displaystyle\\frac{\\beta}{4}\\int_{x_0}^1 dx\\displaystyle\\frac{1+x^2}{1-x}\\left [ \\phi(x)-\\phi(1)\\right ] + { \\cal o}(\\beta^2 ) , \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] removing therefore the singularity .",
    "in this appendix we perform the following integration : @xmath170 @xmath171 where @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "first we perform wick - rotation ( @xmath172 ) and imply the cut - off provided by @xmath153-function using that parameterizing @xmath173 where @xmath174 .",
    "we also performed the integration over the azimuthal - angle @xmath175 .",
    "now let us consider the integral in the breit - system where @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "thus @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is the electron scattering angle in laboratory frame .",
    "before integrating over angle @xmath184 let us write the explicit expression for real part of integrand : @xmath185 where @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 .",
    "the integration over @xmath184 is straightforward and results in : @xmath190      one can see that in the limiting case : @xmath193 and @xmath194 , @xmath93 is finite , whereas for @xmath195 and @xmath196 , @xmath197 .",
    "this is responsible for the behavior of the two photon exchange contribution as a function of @xmath19 .",
