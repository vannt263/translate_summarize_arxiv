    "a detailed description of the spectrometer can be found in @xcite .    a proton beam of @xmath45 particles / s with @xmath46 kinetic energy was incident on a liquid hydrogen target of @xmath47 thickness corresponding to @xmath48 interaction length .",

    "a common start time for all particles measured in one event was reconstructed as described in detail in @xcite . with this method",
    "the time - of - flight information could be determined for almost all of the measured events .",
    "the aim of this analysis is to reconstruct the @xmath1 signal in the following reaction and decay chain :    [ reac1 ]    ( 0.,0 . ) ( 3.5,-0.1)(3.5,-0.45)(3.9,-0.45 ) ( 4.1,-0.7)(4.1,-1.05)(4.5,-1.05 )    p(3.5gev)+p ( 1385)&^+ + k^++n [ s1385pproduction ] + & + ^+ + & p+^- .",

    "this cut is shown by the vertical dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ neumm ] and corresponds to @xmath73 .",
    "due to the incomplete purity of the kaon selection , even after all the cuts applied so far , a large fraction of the kaon candidates are still pions or protons .",
    "in particular , the contamination due to misidentified pions is rather high as visible in fig .",
    "[ kaonm ] . in order to estimate quantitatively this background contribution",
    "a dedicated side - band analysis based on the mass distribution of the selected k@xmath54 candidates has been developed .",
    "the goal of this analysis is to produce an event sample , which does not contain any kaon but either a pion or a proton misidentified as a kaon . to emulate the background ,",
    "events have been selected containing four charged particles : one proton , one @xmath53 , one @xmath33 and a fourth positively charged particle for which no identification is required .",
    "the mass distribution of this fourth particle is shown in fig .",
    "[ allk ] , where one can see that most of the yield is located around the nominal pion and proton masses and that no kaon peak is visible .",

    "these cuts ( ( 1 - 3 ) in section  [ id1 ] ) have been omitted in order to enhance the statistics of the background sample .    however , although the selection of the misidentified pions and protons is done in a range rather distant from the nominal kaon mass , the two misidentification samples still contain a certain amount of real kaons .",
    "these real kaons are produced together with a @xmath16 , due to strangeness conservation . since the selection on the @xmath53-proton pairs invariant mass around the @xmath16 nominal mass",
    "is also applied to the background samples , the contribution by real kaons is enhanced .    our strategy to reduce the contribution of the real kaon signal to this background samples is to smear simultaneously the momenta of the identified @xmath33 and @xmath53 such that the @xmath16 signal in the @xmath53-proton invariant mass distribution disappears .",
    "this way , the@xmath78 selection in the @xmath52-@xmath59 invariant mass distribution does not enhance the fraction of events with a @xmath79 .    a further issue to be addressed deals with the specific kinematics of the particles selected via the cut around the nominal kaon mass ( from here on considered as fake kaons ) and of the explicitely misidentified pions and protons , employing the side band cut .",

    "one can see that the shapes of these distributions are rather different .",
    "this difference can not be neglected during the evaluation of background due to fake kaons , since we are performing an exclusive analysis with the total four - momentum being conserved .",
    "+ in order to reproduce the momentum distribution of the fake kaons the following function must be determined : @xmath80 where f@xmath81 , f@xmath82 and f@xmath83 are the momentum distributions of the fake kaons , misidentified pions and protons , respectively .",

    "figure  [ neumm ] shows the resulting missing mass generated by the two background samples ( blue histogram for protons and red histogram for pions ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath84 is varied systematically until the sum of the two background distributions gives the best fit to the region of the spectrum on the left side of the neutron peak , i. e. for @xmath86 .",

    "our side - band method allows indeed to reproduce the total background .",
    "furthermore , the contamination by misidentified pions and protons to the signal can be evaluated quantitatively .",
    "after the cut around the nominal neutron mass in the total missing mass distribution one obtains precisely the signal - to - background ratio and hence can estimate the contribution of the misidentification background to the @xmath1 spectrum .",

    "these corrections also account for the finite resolution of the apparatus which cause a broadening of the @xmath1 resonance of about @xmath100 .",
    "since the fitted breit - wigner distribution is filtered through this correction , the extracted width and pole mass are already corrected also for the resolutions effects . in addition , the phase - space correction factor as a function of the invariant mass must be taken into account .",

    "these parameters were used as an input for a monte - carlo simulation of the process @xmath150 with subsequent @xmath8 decay into @xmath151 . from the simulation we obtain the shape of the angular distribution of the @xmath10 in the helicity angle frame . figure  [ costnk_s ] shows , together with the experimental data , simulation results stemming from non - resonant production of the @xmath1 ( red histogram ) and via a @xmath8 production ( blue histogram ) .",

    "the differential cross section of the neutron in the cms is used to filter the @xmath8 simulations .",
    "this is a natural choice , as the @xmath8 and the neutron are going back to back in this reference frame .",
    "the acceptance corrections are recalculated using the filtered simulation and new experimental distributions are obtained .",

    "the energy loss cuts in the mdc and tofino detector have been also varied by @xmath158 .",
    "the agreement of the simulated data with the experimental points in panels ( a ) and ( b ) is a constraint imposed by the iterative procedure described above , on the other hand the validity of the new acceptance correction is supported by the fact that the distribution in panel ( a ) is more symmetric then the one shown in fig .  [ sigmacm ] . in order to check whether the simulated model really fits to the experimental data , other , independent angular distributions have to be analyzed .",

    "the distributions shown in panels ( g ) and ( i ) of fig .  [ 3dist ] are linked to the partial waves acting at the respective verteces but no specific assumption is made in our simulation .",
    "nevertheless , these distributions are kinematically correlated with the cms distributions .",
    "this is also at the origin of the good agreement between the experimental and the simulated angular distributions in the helicity frame .",
    "it is clear that the nine angular distributions are not all kinematically independent from each other , they are here shown for the sake of completeness .",
    "these distributions constitute an important reference to test future theoretical models describing the production .",
    "indeed different production mechanisms will result in different angular distributions of the decay products .",
    "it has also to be pointed out that the internal degrees of freedom of the @xmath1 and the intermediate @xmath8 resonance are neglected in our simulations .",
    "the overall agreement of the experimental data with the angular distributions modeled with the simulations justifies the usage of the resulting acceptance corrections , despite of the fact that the contribution by the @xmath8 resonance can not be demonstrated unambiguously .",
    "the last step of the analysis consists of the calculation of the production cross section .",
    "the production cross section has been estimated by the integration of the simulated differential cross sections adapted to the experimental data over the whole phase space for each of the nine distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ 3dist ] . indeed , assuming that proper acceptance and efficiency corrections have been applied , the same total cross section for the exclusive production of the @xmath1 resonance in the reaction pp @xmath161 should be obtained .",

    "[ 3dist ] delivers values of the total production cross section that are in agreement within the statistical errors .",
    "the arithmetic mean of these values yields @xmath162 .",
    "the statistical error is followed by a first systematic error arising from the normalization to the elastic events and a second asymmetric error stemming from the cut variations discussed above .",
    "this cross section can be compared to the values known for the @xmath163 production in p+p collisions .",
    "figure  [ cross ] shows the production cross sections for the reaction @xmath164 as a function of the excess energy @xmath165 .",
    "the cross section extracted from our analysis of the channel @xmath166 is shown together with the measurement at higher energies reported in @xcite .",
    "the data point corresponding to the @xmath1 is about a factor two lower than the cross section value extracted for the @xmath167 at the same excess energy but still compatible within the systematic errors .",
    "our data point agrees well with the value of @xmath168 reported in @xcite for @xmath1 at an excess energy of @xmath169 also in p+p collisions , pointing to a weak dependence on excess energy of both @xmath170 and @xmath1 production above @xmath171 .",
    "we present the results obtained from an exclusive analysis of the @xmath1 resonance produced in p+p collisions at a kinetic energy of 3.5 gev .",
    "the sophisticated method developed for the reconstruction of the background allows to estimate with high precision the position and the width of this resonance .",
    "the value extracted for the mass , @xmath172 , agrees well with the pdg value @xcite , while the width , @xmath173 , is about @xmath110 larger than the pdg average @xcite .",
    "angular distributions have been corrected for acceptance and detector response by means of a complete simulations testing two assumptions for the production mechanism .",
    "our analysis suggests that a @xmath7 of the @xmath1 yield originates from the decay of an intermediate @xmath8 resonance , whereas one should underline that interference effects could also modify the kinematics of the reaction .",
    "the efficiency and acceptance corrected angular distribution of the three reference frames cm , helicity and gottfried - jackson have been extracted and can be used to test theoretical models describing the production mechanisms for the @xmath1 state .",
    "a total production cross section of @xmath174 has been deduced and is found to be consistent with the systematics measured for the ground state @xmath170 production in the same final state as a function of the excess energy .",
    "the available data base do not exhibit a strong dependence of the production cross section on the excess energy in the range @xmath175 for both the ground state @xmath170 and the first excited state @xmath1 .",
    "our results provide the necessary reference for further studies of the spectral shape of the @xmath10 resonance in p+a and a+a reactions .",
    "furthermore , our analysis represents an important bench mark for the investigation of the @xmath15 resonance in p+p , p+a and a+a collisions .",
