    "asymptotic analyses have been actively studied in the recent queueing theory .",
    "this is because queueing models , particularly , queueing networks , become very complicated and their exact analyses are getting harder .",
    "we are interested in asymptotic analyses for large queues in a generalized jackson network and aim to understand their asymptotic behaviors through its modeling primitives .",
    "there are two different types of asymptotic analyses for large queues .",
    "one is for a given model fixed .",
    "large deviations is typically studied for this .",
    "another is to study them through an approximating model .",
    "for example , such a model is obtained as the limit of a sequence of models under heavy traffic by scaling of time , space and/or modeling primitives .",
    "it is called heavy traffic approximation ( e.g. , see @xcite ) . here ,",
    "large queues are caused by heavy traffic . in this paper , we focus on the large deviations for a fixed model . among them , we are particularly interested in the logarithmic tail asymptotics of the stationary distribution for a generalized jackson network , gjn for short",
    ".    this problem has been studied by the standard approach of large deviations , but the decay rates are hard to analytically get using modeling primitives ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "the author @xcite recently studied it by a matrix analytic method , and derived the decay rates for the marginal stationary distributions in an arbitrary direction for a two station gjn , assuming phase type distributions for service times and arrival processes , called a phase - type setting .",
    "we aim to generalize this result under a more general setting by a different approach .",
    "let @xmath0 be the number of stations in the gjn . for @xmath1",
    ", we relax the phase type assumption , and consider the decay rates of the stationary probabilities for state sets of small volumes in addition to those of the marginal stationary distribution . for @xmath2 , we derive upper and lower bounds for those decay rates .    our basic idea is to simplify the derivation of those asymptotic results in such a way that they are obtained in a similar manner to a reflecting random walk on a multidimensional orthant .",
    "this simplification greatly benefits for analysis although the decay rate problems for the reflecting random walk have not been fully solved even for @xmath1 . to this end , we take an approach studied for a single queue with heterogeneous servers in @xcite , and modify it for a queueing network . in this approach , we first describe the gjn by a piecewise deterministic markov process , pdmp for short .",
    "we then derive martingales for change of measures , and formulate the asymptotic problems under a new measure . the idea for simplification is used in deriving the martingale .",
    "pdmp is a continuous time markov process whose sample path is composed of two parts , a continuous part , which is deterministic , and a discontinuous part , called jumps , by which randomness is created .",
    "thus , pdmp is particularly suitable for queueing models . however , jump instants are random , and state changes at them are complicated .",
    "because of this , pdmp is hard for analysis .",
    "so , other methods have been employed in queueing theory .",
    "for example , the state space is discretized using phase type distributions , and a markov chain is obtained .",
    "then , matrix analysis is applicable .",
    "this phase type approach is numerically powerful but analytically less explicit because of state space description .",
    "furthermore , it is getting harder to apply as a queueing model becomes complicated like a queueing network .",
    "we will not use such a matrix analysis .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out that the phase type assumption is helpful in our asymptotic analysis in some cases .",
    "contrary to the analytical difficulty , the pdmp has a simple sample path . its time evolution is easily presented by a stochastic integral equation using a test function , which maps the states of the pdmp to real values ( see ( [ eq : dynamics 1 ] ) ) . in this stochastic equation , state changes at the jump",
    "instants cause difficulty for analysis as we mentioned above .",
    "@xcite who introduced pdmp replaces those state changes at jump instants by a martingale and the so called boundary condition on the test function .    however , it is not easy to find a good class of the test functions which characterize a distribution on the state space of the pdmp .",
    "the idea of @xcite is to choose a smaller class of test functions to overcome those difficulties .",
    "we then have a martingale , which can not characterize a distribution on the state space , but still retains full information to study large queues .",
    "once the martingale is obtained , then we use the standard technique for change of measure through constructing an exponential martingale , called a multiplicative functional .    in applying this martingale approach to the gjn , we need to know how the network model is changed under the new measure .",
    "intuitively , some of its stations must be unstable for the tail asymptotic analysis to work . to study this instability problem",
    ", we will use the fact that the network structure is unchanged under the change of measure , and therefore the stability of each station is characterized by the traffic intensity at that station .",
    "these traffic intensities are obtained from the traffic equations , but they are non - linear because of unstable stations . thus , this instability problem is not obvious .",
    "we challenge it , and find some sufficient conditions for the gjn to be partly unstable under the new measure , which depends on the choice of a martingale for change of measure .",
    "this paper is made up by four sections . in section",
    "[ sect : gjn ] , the gjn ( generalized jackson network ) is described by a pdmp , and a martingale for change of measure is derived .",
    "this section also considers geometric interpretations of the stability condition of the gjn , and present main results for the asymptotic problems .",
    "section  [ sect : change ] discusses the method of change of measure , and considers how the gjn is changed under a new measure . in section  [",
    "sect : proofs ] , the main results are proved .",
    "for this , we first list major steps for deriving upper and lower bounds , then prepare several lemmas to complete the proofs .    in this paper",

    "column and row vectors and their dimensions are not specified as long as they can be identified in the context where they are used .",

    "we are concerned with a queueing network which has a finite number of stations with single servers and single class of customers . at each station",
    ", there is an infinite buffer , exogenous customers arrive subject to a renewal process if any , and customers are served in first - come - first - served manner by independent and identically distributed service times .",
    "furthermore , the renewal process and service times are independent of everything else . customers who complete service at a station",
    "are independently routed to the next stations or leave the network according to a given probability .",
    "we refer this queueing network as a gjn ( generalized jackson network ) .",
    "let us introduce notations for a gjn .",

    "we call @xmath39 as a routing matrix , while @xmath40 is called an over all routing matrix .    at time",

    "that is , all the distributions , @xmath69 , have light tail and their moment generating functions diverges at their singular points .",
    "these conditions are assumed for technical simplicity .",
    "for some important cases , we have to restrict these distributions in the following class .",
    "a positive random variable @xmath70 or its distribution is said to have a conditional mgf ( moment generating function ) with a uniform bound if there is a function @xmath71 of @xmath72 such that @xmath73 implies that @xmath74 as long as @xmath75 .",
    "obviously , if @xmath70 is bounded , it satisfies ( [ eq : residual 1 ] ) .",
    "another obvious example is a nbu distribution , which is characterized by @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "an important class for our application is of phase type , which is defined as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a finite dimensional probability vector , and @xmath80 is a defective transition rate matrix with the same dimension as @xmath79 such that @xmath81 is finite .",

    "hence , we have ( [ eq : residual 1 ] ) by letting @xmath88 be the maximum of all the entries of the vector @xmath89 .",

    "this is the reason why we put superscript `` @xmath104 '' here .      in this paper , we consider @xmath60 as a piecewise deterministic markov process , pdmp for short , introduced by @xcite .",
    "pdmp is a markov process with piece - wise deterministic and continuously differentiable sample path and finitely many discontinuous epochs in each finite time interval .",
    "its randomness arises at discontinuous epochs , which are uniquely determined by hitting times when the deterministic sample path gets into a specified state set .",
    "the set of those discontinuous epochs constitute a counting process , which is random because the piece - wise deterministic sample path is randomly changed at those times .",
    "we here assume that there is no other discontinuous state change .",
