    "biological tissues are viscoelastic .",
    "concepts developed for describing passive viscoelastic materials have been applied to biological tissues  @xcite . however , active processes such as forces generated by the cells , cell movement , and cell proliferation make biological tissues different from passive viscoelastic materials .",
    "thus biological tissues fall into the category of active soft matters   @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "junctions between neighboring cells prevent free diffusion of cells in a tissue .",
    "it makes biological tissues different from other active biological systems such as bacterial colonies and cell cytoplasm . as a result ,",
    "biological tissues become interesting systems to study complex collective motion and morphogenesis . for example , it is known that the homeostasis state of a tissue often has undulating surface to increase the contact area with its environment . understanding the formation and maintenance of such spatial structure is thus important for fundamental research of active matters and for applied research such as fabricating functional surfaces and flexible electronics  @xcite .",
    "experiments have demonstrated that at short time scales a tissue is solid - like due to the adhesion junctions between cells  @xcite . since the residual stresses can relax due to turnover of junction proteins  @xcite and cell rearrangement induced by cell division and cell apoptosis  @xcite , a tissue is liquid - like at long time scales  @xcite .",
    "this suggests a characteristic time @xmath0 such that at time scales smaller than @xmath0 a tissue behaves like a solid with shear modulus @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "at time scales larger than @xmath0 , a tissue behaves like a fluid with viscosity @xmath2 .",
    "typically @xmath3  pa  @xcite , and @xmath4  s  @xcite , therefore @xmath5 is on the order of @xmath6  pa  s  @xcite .    in this study",
    "we focus on stratified epithelium , a multi - layered continuous self - renewal tissue  @xcite .",
    "epithelium often forms the outermost layer of skin and mucous membrane , and acts as a barrier separating the outside and inside of a multicellular organism  @xcite . on the top of a stratified epithelium",
    "is a free apical surface , on the bottom is a basement membrane attached to the underlying connective tissue composed primarily of collagen and elastin fibers .",
    "typically the thickness of stratified epithelium is @xmath7 and the thickness of the underlying connective tissue is @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the proliferative cells are often localized near the basal lamina , suggesting the existence of a special microenvironment called stem cell niche  @xcite . above the proliferative cells are terminally differentiated cells .",
    "they are functional cells that do not divide , instead they undergo programed cell death ( apoptosis ) .",
    "intuitively , different cells should have different mechanical properties . as supported by recent experiments , stem cells and tumor cells",
    "often have smaller stiffness than normal differentiated cells  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the mechanical properties of a tissue should also depend on local tissue composition  @xcite .",
    "the effects of such inhomogeneity on tissue dynamics is the focus of this study .",
    "undulating / fingering structures that are important for biological functions are often seen in the apical surface or basal membrane of a stratified epithelium .",
    "for example , skin wrinkles or folds are formed when a skin is deformed by external / residual stresses with wavelength @xmath9  @xcite . at length scale @xmath10",
    ", rete pegs interdigitate with dermal papillae are observed in the interface between skin epithelium and stroma  @xcite .",
    "similar structures have also been observed in the epithelium of mucous membrane  @xcite .",
    "studies have shown that elastic forces could be important during the formation of the aformentioned structures . by modeling a stratified epithelium as an elastic solid in contact with the underlying elastic connective tissue ,",
    "the formation of skin wrinkles was associated with the buckling instability originated from the competition between bending energy of epithelium and stretching energy of connective tissue  @xcite .",
    "the rete peg structure was suggested to arise from the incompatible growth of epithelium and connective tissue  @xcite .",
    "similar mechanism can also explain the formation of fingerprint  @xcite , crypt  @xcite , and surface wrinkling of tumor spheroids  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , hydrodynamic instabilities are also likely to produce undulating morphologies in stratified epithelium .",
    "for example the formation of rete peg structure could arise from proliferation - induced stresses  @xcite , and",
    "an essential condition of this result is that the net cell proliferative rate deceases with the distance from basal lamina .",
    "some models considered more details such as cell lineage dynamics  @xcite , viscoelasticity of the underlying stroma  @xcite , and the effect of growth factors inside a tissue  @xcite .",
    "overall , several interesting structures and patterns can be understood by a continuum description of tissues without describing the movement of individual cells and biomolecular events in details .",
    "the mechanical stresses induced by cell turnover inside a tissue  @xcite is sufficient to do this job .",
    "the aim of this work is to study theoretically how inhomogeneity of mechanical properties in a tissue affects the tissue dynamics . for illustrative purpose",
    "we consider a stratified epithelium on a rigid stroma .",
    "we begin with a simple model in which the mechanical properties of the tissue is assumed to be homogeneous . with proliferative cells occupying the lower part , and terminal differentiated cells occupying the upper part of the tissue , this model has a homeostasis state with a flat apical surface .",
    "the linearized dynamics close to the homeostasis state in this model already reveals interesting effects from flows and cell proliferation .",
    "for example , cell division / apoptosis speed up tissue relaxation towards the homeostasis state ; but this effect is relatively weak when the wavelength of the perturbation is of the order of the thickness of the tissue .    due to frequent cell division events , tissue viscosity in the region rich in proliferative cells should be different from the rest of the tissue .",
    "this feature is included in our second model .",
    "such a modification indeed leads to a different dispersion relation for tissue dynamics close to the homeostasis state .",
    "especially , when the proliferative region becomes sufficiently thick , cell apoptosis close to the apical region could induce a flow that strongly hinders the relaxation towards the steady state .",
    "this effect is especially significant for perturbations with wavelength comparable to tissue thickness ( @xmath11 m for typical stratified epithlium ) .",
    "since our model is quite general , we expect this destabilizing mechanism to exist in continuous self - renewal tissue , but it is not easy to be observed in normal healthy tissue because the proliferative cells only occupy a thin region .",
    "however , during development or regeneration there is often a transient increase of proliferative cell inside tissues @xcite . as a result , the new effect described by our second model could happen , and it is even possible that undulating apical surface could be generated by this mechanism .    this article is organized as follows .",

    "[ s : conclusion ] , based on these results , we make a conclusion and propose possible experimental tests to validate our theory .",

    "experimentally , the viscosity of a tissue can be estimated from the elastic constant @xmath1 and relaxation time @xmath0 through the relation @xmath20 .",

    "[ s : method - model2 ] when we introduce our second model .",
    "we focus on the situation when the tissue is soft compared to the stroma , therefore the stroma is modeled as a rigid substrate for simplicity , and the flow field vanishes at @xmath30 . more general model that includes the viscoelastic properties of the stroma will be deferred to future studies .",

    "we emphasize that our model is independent of the details of @xmath39 , the only constraint for @xmath39 is to have steady - state tissue height @xmath40 which satisfies eq .",

    "typically the division rate of proliferative cells is large compared to the apoptosis rate of differentiated cells  @xcite .",
    "since stress relaxation in a tissue strongly depends on the division and apoptosis of the cells  @xcite , the viscosity in regions rich in proliferative cells should be smaller than the viscosity in the other regions of the tissue .",

    "note that in this model @xmath83 .    with the aforementioned simplification , in this model",
    "we choose @xmath84 for @xmath74 and @xmath85 for @xmath75 . the geometry and boundary conditions for the linearized tissue evolution equations are the same as those for our first model , except for additional velocity and stress continuity conditions at @xmath86 .",

    "the continuity of normal stress at @xmath81 leads to a discontinuity of tissue pressure in our model that should be smoothed out in a real tissue because the boundary between proliferative region and differentiated region is diffuse , not infinitely sharp .",

    "[ f : new_mech_phy ] as these figures help us to get a better idea of how they behave as the parameters @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath80 change .",
    "besides their shapes , it is important to point out two issues .",
    "first , @xmath99 is the same as the dispersion relation of the upper surface of a phase - separated binary low reynolds number fluid with lower fluid viscosity @xmath100 , thickness @xmath81 , and upper fluid viscosity @xmath16 , thickness @xmath101 .",
    "second , in the limit @xmath102 , eq .  ( [ new_mech ] ) and ( [ new_phy ] ) become eq .  (",

    "figure  [ f : new_mech_phy ] shows @xmath103 and @xmath104 for @xmath105 .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath95 is always negative ( stabilizing ) , and its magnitude increases with @xmath80 .",
    "this is because the thickness of the lower ( less viscous ) region of the tissue increases and the damping is slowed down as @xmath80 increases . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath96 is a non - monotonic function of @xmath80 , as this term is originated from cell division / apoptosis , it can not be simply explained by the viscous properties of the tissue .",
    "we will discuss more about the behavior of @xmath96 in the next section when the flow field in the tissue is examined .",
    "for fixed @xmath80 and @xmath97 , @xmath104 has a minimum at @xmath106 .",
    "note that , unlike our first model , here @xmath67 depends on @xmath80 and @xmath107 .",
    "figure  [ f : xi](a ) shows @xmath67 versus @xmath80 for different choices of @xmath97 .",
    "it is clear that in our second model the minimum of @xmath108 also occurs at @xmath109 .",
    "figure  [ f : xi](b ) shows that when @xmath80 and @xmath97 are large , it is possible for @xmath96 to become positive .",
    "that is , it is possible for cell division / apoptosis to either slow down the relaxation toward the steady state , or even drive the tissue to an instability .",
    "this will be discused in details in sec .",
    "[ s : result - double edged ] .    in this section @xmath107 and @xmath80",
    "are treated as independent variables .",
    "we will discuss the relation between @xmath97 and @xmath80 in sec .",
    "[ s : result - cell composition ] .",
    "an immediate interesting question of our hydrodynamic theory of epithelium tissue is , besides fluidizing the tissue , how cell turnover inside the tissue affects tissue dynamics .",
    "this is considered in both our models . in the first model",
    ", we have assumed that the net cell proliferation rate in a tissue is the only property that depends on the distance from the basal membrane , all other properties of the tissue are homogeneous . on the other hand , in the second model",
    ", regions with different net cell proliferation rate are assumed to have different viscosity .",
    "interestingly , these two models predict very different tissue dynamics , revealing nontrivial effects of cell turnover on tissue dynamics .    in our first model ( sec .",
    "[ s : method - model1 ] ) , the tissue is homogeneous except for the proliferative property .",
    "the linearized dynamics near the steady state shows that the steady state is always stable under small perturbations .",
    "the relaxation rate towards the homeostasis state contains two terms ( eq .  ( [ dispersion ] ) ) . the first term @xmath60 ( eq .  ( [ mech_con ] ) ) is driven by the surface tension of the apical surface , it is the same as the dispersion relation for the liquid - air surface of a low reynolds number simple liquid .",
    "it always stabilizes the tissue and this rate increases with the wavenumber @xmath61 ( fig .",
    "[ f : mech_unsphy_contribution ]  ( a ) ) .",
    "the second term @xmath65 ( eq .  ( [ phy_con ] ) ) comes from cell turnover in the tissue . to gain further insight on the effect of this term to the dynamics of the tissue , in fig .",
    "[ f : model1_flow ]  ( a)(b ) the field lines of @xmath110 , the deviation of velocity field from the steady state in a tissue is plotted for a tissue with zero apical surface tension @xmath53 for two different values of @xmath98 . since @xmath111 , the relaxation of the tissue is completely driven by the mechanism represented by @xmath65 .",
    "it can be clearly seen that there is a flow induced by cell apoptosis at the apical surface . as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ f : model1_flow](c ) , cell apoptosis close to the apical surface gives an effective surface flow .",
    "this is the mechanism that drives the flow field shown in fig .",
    "[ f : model1_flow](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "figure  [ f : model1_flow](b ) shows that when @xmath98 is far from @xmath67 ( @xmath112 ) , the flow is restricted to region close to the apical surface . on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ f : model1_flow](a ) shows that when @xmath98 is closer to @xmath67 , the flow can penetrate deeper into the tissue . as @xmath61 further decreases to @xmath113 the apical surface becomes nearly flat , and the induced horizontal flow ( not shown ) is again small .",
    "therefore the effect of induced flow is significant when @xmath114 .",
    "this is reflected in sec .",
    "[ s : method - model1 ] as the minimum of the magnitude of @xmath108 at @xmath98 of order unity .",
    "the fact that @xmath108 has a minimum at @xmath115 also indicates that although intuitively cell turnover helps to stabilize the tissue , flow induced by apoptosis at apical surface slows down the relaxation of the tissue .",
    "indeed , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ f : model1_flow ]  ( c ) , the induced flow tends to push cells from regions where the tissue is thin to regions where the tissue is thick . anyway , combining these two effects , in this model @xmath108 is still negative for all @xmath61 .",
    "that is , our first model predicts that cell turnover helps to stabilize the homeostasis state , although the stabilizing effect is relatively weak when @xmath116 .",
    "it is interesting to note that fig .",
    "[ f : model1_flow](a ) and fig .",
    "[ f : model1_flow](b ) also shows that vortices appears in the flow field when @xmath117 , and they are absent when @xmath118 .",

    "the field lines for @xmath120 look very different from the field lines for @xmath121 .",
    "as @xmath98 increases from @xmath122 to @xmath117 , vortices appear in the induced flow , this is similar to our first model ( see fig .  [",
    "f : model1_flow ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "let @xmath123 be the height of the center of the vortices .",
    "when @xmath117 , fig .",
    "[ f : model2_flow ] shows that for @xmath124 , @xmath96 decreases as @xmath80 increases ; however , when @xmath125 , @xmath96 increases as @xmath80 increases . when @xmath126 , @xmath96 has a minimum ( not shown in the figure ) . on the other hand , when @xmath127 , @xmath96 increases monotonically with @xmath80 .",
    "this shows that the shape of @xmath96 in fig .",
    "[ f : new_mech_phy](c ) is related to both the flow induced by cell division / apoptosis and the thickness of the proliferative region .",
    "a very important result of our second model is that the sign of @xmath96 can be positive , i.e. , it is possible that the overall effect of cell division / apoptosis is to hinder the relaxation of the tissue towards the steady state .",
    "this occurs when the following two conditions are both satisfied .",
    "( i ) the viscosity @xmath100 in the region @xmath128 is sufficiently small compared to @xmath129 ( the viscosity in the region @xmath130 ) .",
    "( ii ) the relative thickness of the proliferative region @xmath131 , is sufficiently large . in sec .",
    "[ s : result - cell composition ] we will discuss the relation between the distribution of proliferative cells and viscosity , there we will show that indeed in general @xmath132 .",
    "however , a tissue that satisfies condition ( ii ) is likely not a normal tissue , as a healthy mature epithelium tissue usually has a relatively thin layer of proliferative cells , a tissue with large @xmath131 is more likely to be found during development or regeneration .",

    "[ f : model2_diagram ]  ( a ) and ( b ) .",

    "[ f : model2_diagram ]  ( a ) and ( b ) , tissues with small @xmath133 are relatively easy to become unstable , this is due to the relatively weak stabilizing effect from the apical surface tension .    intuitively cell turnover does not necessarily drive a tissue unstable .",
    "indeed we know from our previous discussion that sometimes cell turnover helps to stabilize the homeostasis state , while sometimes cell turnover drives a steady state unstable .",
    "therefore it is interesting to see when cell turnover stabilizes or destabilizes a steady state . fig .",
    "[ f : model2_diagram ]  ( c)-(f ) shows how growth rate of small perturbations close to the steady state changes with our model parameters .",
    "it suggests that increasing @xmath15 and @xmath17 helps to stabilize the steady state , as the peak of the growth rate decreases ; on the other hand , increasing @xmath14 and @xmath129 helps to destabilize the steady state , as the maximum growth rate of small perturbations increases .",
    "this further confirms the intuition suggested by fig .",
    "[ f : model2_diagram](a ) and  [ f : model2_diagram](b ) .",
    "now we can summarize the role of cell turnover in the dynamics of a tissue close to a steady state .",
    "when the tissue height is perturbed from its steady state value , cell turnover drives the tissue toward the steady state . on the hand , cell apoptosis on the apical surface induces a flow in the tissue that brings more cells to thicker regions and pushes cells away from regions with smaller thickness . for a normal tissue ,",
    "proliferative cells occupy a small region close to the basal surface , the overall effect of these mechanisms to tissue dynamics always helps to stabilize the tissue . on the other hand , for a tissue with a large proportion of proliferative cells ,",
    "when the viscosity of the proliferative region of the tissue is sufficiently small compare to the viscosity of the non - proliferative region , the induced flow can destabilize the steady state , and the first instability occurs at wavelength @xmath134 .",
    "[ s : method - model2 ] stated that the viscosity in a tissue depends on the local tissue composition .",
    "a derivation of the viscosity from a general hydrodynamic model of stratified epithelium tissue is presented in the appendix , where it is assumed that the stress relaxation process has negligible contribution from the turnover of junction proteins , and cell division / apoptosis produce force distribution that dominates the active stress inside a tissue .",

    "since cell division / apoptosis inevitably induces a flow in this tissue , the position - dependent viscosity in the tissue has a profound effect on its dynamics .",

    "perturbations with wavelengths comparable to the thickness of the tissue has the slowest relaxation rate toward the steady state .",
    "when the tissue has a thick proliferative region , and the viscosity of the proliferative region is significantly smaller than the other region , the steady state can even become unstable .",
    "our model is quite general , thus our prediction should hold in general for stratified continuous self - renewal tissues . in the context of stratified epithelium , many undulating patterns , for example rete peg @xcite , occur at basal lamina , and its mechanical origin has been explained by previous theoretical works @xcite . on the other hand , our result provides a possible route to trigger epithelial apical surface undulations .",
    "although an instability due to the induced flow described by our model is unlikely to happen in a normal stratified tissue , such mechanism could be important during embryogenesis and wound healing .",
    "furthermore , when two different tissues are in contact @xcite , the viscosity difference between these two tissues could also lead to interesting hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "these possibilities will be explored in our future works .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that although in principle apical surface patterns can be a result of inhomogeneous distribution of growth factors in the tissue @xcite , our model reveal that pure mechanical force is sufficient to induce apical surface patterns .    to test our theory by in vitro experiments",
    ", one could try to increase the death rate of differentiated cells to increase @xmath80 , and decrease the tissue apical surface tension to make the contribution from @xmath108 relatively more significant . in the case of mammalian olfactory epithelium",

    "another important improvement that we will make in the future work is to develop a model in whch cell distribution is not pre - defined .",
