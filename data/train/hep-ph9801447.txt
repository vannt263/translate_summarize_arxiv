    "<S> we investigate the momentum dependence of the @xmath0 vertex form factor in the presence of the nonperturbative qcd vacuum condensate . </S>",

    "<S> we show that the leading momentum dependence of this vertex form factor is not altered when the contribution of nonperturbative quark condensate is considered .    </S>",
    "<S> the recent observation at cleo of a large branching ratio for @xmath2 decay@xcite has led to various attempts for a theoretical explanation . </S>",
    "<S> most of these attempts rely on @xmath1 being produced via its anomalous coupling to two gluons , which is parametrized by the form factor @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 being the four momenta of the gluons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the momentum behaviour of this form factor is crucial for the success or failure of these proposed mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> for example , @xmath6 has been assumed in ref [ 2 ] , so as to obtain results which agree with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> it has been pointed out , however , that a sigma - model calculation of @xmath7 vertex ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 are off - shell and real gluons , respectively ) leads to a significant momentum dependence of the form @xmath10 @xcite . in attempting to account for the @xmath11 branching ratio </S>",
    "<S> , it is of interest to determine whether this leading momentum dependence is altered by nonperturbative qcd contributions . in this paper , we calculate the quark condensate component of the nonperturbative contribution to @xmath12 to investigate whether the insertion of the @xmath13 augmented quark propagator in the triangle loop alters the leading momentum dependence of the vertex form factor . </S>",

    "<S> ( 2 ) that the leading momentum dependence of @xmath20 indicates a significant suppression of this form factor at large @xmath21 . as a result , the mechanism suggested in ref . [ 2 ] for @xmath22 decay falls short of experimental data by at least an order of magnitude </S>",
    "<S> . a reconciliation of this mechamism to experiment , however , may be possible from a hardening of the leading momentum dependence of @xmath12 by the nonperturbative content of qcd , content which is not taken into account in eq . </S>",

    "<S> we investigate this possibility by calculating the quark - condensate contributions to the form factor @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> qcd condensates characterize the nonperturbative content of the qcd vacuum , and therefore , the inclusion of a quark - condensate insertion should give us some indication of the leading nonperturbative contributions to @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we proceed first by replacing the usual perturbative quark propagator in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 with the full quark propagator @xmath23 @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the nonperturbative qcd vacuum . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the nonperturbative contributions to the quark propagator can be written as @xmath26 the nonlocal vacuum expectation value ( vev ) in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) can be expanded in terms of local condensates @xcite . to ascertain how leading nonperturbative qcd contributions affect the form factor @xmath12 , only the lowest - dimensional ( quark - condensate ) component of the expansion </S>",
    "<S> is considered below . </S>",
    "<S> the quark - condensate projection of the nonperturbative quark propagator is taken from ref .

    "<S> ( 5 ) , one can obtain the nonperturbative @xmath31 contribution to @xmath12 in a straightforward manner . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant feynman diagrams are illustrated in fig . </S>",

    "<S> therefore , we conclude that the lowest - dimensional contribution from nonperturbative qcd _ does not _ alter the significant suppression of the @xmath7 vertex for large gluon virtualities . whether or not this result is valid when higher dimensional condensates are considered remains to be investigated . </S>",
    "<S> however , one would anticipate the effect of higher - dimensional order parameters to be negligible at large momenta , suggesting that the momentum - dependence of @xmath7 vertex form factor is not altered appreciably by nonperturbative qcd effects . </S>"
