    "disorder is ubiquitous in materials and can drastically alter their properties , in particular , their electronic structure and transport properties , and even may induce electron localization .",
    "this phenomenon is known as the anderson metal - insulator - transition .",
    "@xcite here , the transition from a metal to an insulator is not characterized by the vanishing of the charge carrier density but by the cancellation of the hybridization paths accompanying the quantum localization of the wave functions due to coherent backscattering from random impurities , deep - trapped states , etc . as a result ,",
    "electrons that occupy such exponentially localized states are restricted to finite regions of space , and hence can not contribute to transport .",
    "the anderson insulator is gapless indicating that the single - particle excitations are essential in determining its physical properties especially at low energies .",
    "while there has been significant progress in the quest to understand this phenomenon , a proper effective mean - field treatment is not yet fully developed .",
    "there have been numerous theoretical studies of disordered electron systems employing computational techniques of varying complexity not limited to numerically exact methods including exact diagonalization , transfer matrix , and kernel polynomial methods,@xcite various renormalization group techniques ,  @xcite and mean - field theories .",
    "@xcite while numerical exact methods have been successfully used to study anderson localization , they generally require the treatment of large clusters and the use of powerful computers . as a result , they are difficult to extend to the treatment of interacting systems or chemically specific models . an alternative approach is offered by mean - field theories such as the coherent potential approximation and its extensions .",
    "@xcite they map the lattice onto relatively small self - consistently embedded clusters .",
    "these methods have been successfully extended to the treatment of interacting disordered systems and to chemically realistic models .",
    "unfortunately , these methods have been woeful in the treatment of the anderson localization due mainly to the averaging procedure utilized and improvements in the environment describing the effective medium have been limited to single - sites .    due to the central role",
    "a mean - field theory that properly describes the anderson localization transition ( alt ) may play for further progress in the study of electron localization , there is a need to formulate such theory .",
    "furthermore , a well - known long historical dichotomy exists between the mean - field results and the numerical data for the anderson localization transition . here",
    ", we demonstrate that the dichotomy can be reconciled by incorporating spatial fluctuations in a typical environment into the mean - field theory thereby offering a solution to this long - standing problem and providing a systematic framework in the mean - field theory of the anderson localization .",
    "the most commonly used self - consistent mean - field theory , in the study of disordered electron systems , is the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) .",
    "@xcite in the cpa , the original disordered lattice is replaced by an impurity placed in an averaged local ( momentum - independent ) effective medium .",
    "while the cpa successfully describes some one - particle properties , such as the density of states ( dos ) in substitutional disordered alloys ,  @xcite it fails to describe the anderson localization transition .",
    "this failure stems , in part , from the single - site nature of the cpa , as it is unable to capture crucial multiple backscattering interference effects that lead to electron localization .",
    "cluster extensions of the cpa , like the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca )  @xcite and molecular cpa  @xcite , allow for the incorporation of such nonlocal spatial correlations ; however , they still fail to describe the anderson localization transition .",
    "the arithmetic averages of random one - particle quantities ( e.g. , density of states ) calculated within such mean - field theories can not distinguish between extended and localized states and are not critical at the anderson transition .",
    "@xcite hence , such average quantities can not be used as an order parameter .",
    "this is the reason that most mean - field theories like the cpa @xcite and its cluster extensions including the dca ,  @xcite fail to provide a proper description of the anderson localization in disordered systems .",
    "this failure is intrinsic to these theories as the algebraically averaged quantities , i.e. , the averaged density of states , always favor the metallic state .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that in an infinite system of localized states , the average density of states is nothing but the global density of states , which is a smooth function of the disorder strength near the critical point while the local density of states becomes discrete with a non - trivial system size dependence ( see , e.g. , refs . for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "further , due to the large fluctuations in the local green function , its _ typical value _ is far removed from the average one  @xcite as such , the local average green function , which characterizes these mean - field environments , does not have any information about the",
    "_ typical nature _ of the local order parameter needed to signal a phase transition . in sec .",
    "[ sec : absence_dca ] , we will demonstrate the failures of finite cluster extensions of the cpa in characterizing the anderson localization transition using the dca .    finding a proper single - particle order parameter for the anderson localization transition capable of distinguishing between the localized and extended states is a major challenge in the study of disordered electronic systems .",
    "in contrast to the arithmetic average , the geometrical average @xcite gives a better approximation to the most probable value of the local density of states .",
    "dobrosavljevi  @xcite developed the typical medium theory ( tmt ) to study disordered systems , where the typical density of states ( tdos ) , approximated using the geometrical averaging over disorder configurations , is used instead of the arithmetically averaged local density of states .",
    "they demonstrated that the tdos vanishes continuously as the strength of the disorder increases towards the critical point and it can be used as an effective mean - field order parameter for the anderson localization transition .",
    "while the single - site tmt has been shown to be successful in describing localized electron states , it still has several drawbacks .",
    "in particular , it does not provide a proper description of the critical behavior of the anderson localization transition in three dimensions ( 3d ) . as a local approximation",
    ", the tmt neglects the effects of coherent backscattering and , as a result , the critical disorder strength obtained is @xmath0 instead of the numerically exact value @xmath1  @xcite for the box distribution ( in our units ) .",
    "also , the _ universal _ order parameter critical exponent ( which has also been called the _ typical order parameter exponent _ )  @xcite @xmath2 obtained in the local tmt is @xmath3 whereas its recently reported value is @xmath4",
    ".  @xcite another crucial drawback of the single - site tmt in 3d is its inability to capture the re - entrance behavior of the mobility edge ( energy separating extended and localized electron states ) demonstrated in exact numerical studies  @xcite for the disorder distributions with finite variance : the box and gaussian disorder distributions .",
    "the tmt also underestimates the extended state regions in all the disorder distributions studied in this paper .",
    "the inadequacies of the single - site tmt can be remedied by incorporating spatial ( nonlocal ) correlations by constructing its cluster extension .",
    "this can be achieved by using the dca or molecular cpa schemes , which systematically incorporate the missing nonlocal effects .    in this paper , we show in detail a successful extension of the local tmt to its cluster version using ideas from the dca .",
    "we demonstrate how the finite cluster extension of the local tmt is able to systematically solve all the crucial drawbacks of the single - site tmt , indicating the necessity to include the missing nonlocal effects .",
    "one of the features of the anderson localization transition in three dimensions is the non - self - averaging nature of the local quantities close to the localization transition , which obtain a highly skewed ( log - normal ) distribution .",
    "hence special care must be taken in constructing a cluster extension of the tmt .",
    "to avoid such self - averaging issues in the tdos , we developed the typical medium dynamical cluster approximation ( tmdca ) ,  @xcite , which properly characterizes the anderson localization transition in 3d and does not suffer from the self - averaging , by explicitly separating the local part of the tdos and treating it with a geometric average over disorder configurations .",
    "hence , we are able to obtain a proper tdos that characterizes the anderson localization in 3d .",
    "we demonstrate the versatility of our method by applying it to the box , gaussian , lorentzian , and binary disorder distributions and benchmark it with numerically exact methods .",
    "the typical medium dynamical cluster approximation scheme is demonstrated to be a systematic , self - consistent effective medium theory for characterizing electron localization . as a function of increasing cluster size ,",
    "we demonstrate that the tmdca achieves convergence of both the critical disorder strength and the trajectories of the mobility edge as a function of the cluster size .",
    "furthermore , the tmdca fulfills all the essential requirements expected of a `` successful '' cluster theory .",
    "@xcite we find that the tmdca scheme is a systematic self - consistent effective medium theory to study anderson localization transition in three - dimensions , which i ) recovers the original single - site tmt scheme at cluster size @xmath5 = 1 ; ii ) recovers the dca results at small disorder strength ( when most states are metallic ) ; iii ) provides a proper way to separate the energy scales such that the characteristic mobility edge behavior ( for the disorder distributions with finite variance ) is recovered ; iv ) captures the critical behavior of the anderson localization transition with correct critical disorder strength @xmath6 and order parameter critical exponent @xmath2 , and provides the correct description of the anderson insulator at large disorder strength ( when all states are localized ) ; and v ) fulfills all the essential requirements expected of a `` successful '' cluster theory .",
    "@xcite    the main problem addressed in this paper is how the mobility edge energies vary with disorder strength , their trajectories , and what happens to these trajectories in the proximity of the anderson localization transition .",
    "furthermore , since the dca always becomes exact when @xmath7 , the main role of the effective medium in approaches based on the dca , or its extensions , is to accelerate this convergence . for the alt ,",
    "we find that the effective medium formed from the average green function does not converge as @xmath5 becomes large , rather it is only able to describe the precursors to localization ( cf . section  [ sec : absence_dca ] ) .",
    "however , we find that a number of effective media based upon the geometrically averaged density of states provide convergent results , i.e. , an order parameter .",
    "so far , we find that the fastest convergence is provided by the tmdca .",

    "we set @xmath19 as the energy unit . in our analysis , we use different disorder distributions . in particular , we consider the box ( bo ) , gaussian ( ga ) , lorentzian ( lo ) , and binary ( bi ) distributions , respectively , with the corresponding distribution functions @xmath16    @xmath20",
    "where @xmath21 is the step function , @xmath22 is the concentration of the host a atom , @xmath23 is the concentration of the impurity b atom , and the strength of the disorder in units of @xmath24 is parameterized by @xmath25 ( w@xmath26 and w@xmath27 for the binary alloy model ) .",

    ". they can be attributed in part to the form of the disorder distribution .",
    "for example , the bare dos for the gaussian and lorentzian disorder distributions are known to have exponential tails .",
    "the severity of the exponential nature of the tails associated with the various disorder distributions increases as box , gaussian , and lorentzian , in that order . at these higher disorder strengths ( once a mobility edge develops ) ,",
    "the tdos naturally develops tails .",
    "we note that in our computations , apart from the initial small broadening value @xmath97 used in the initialization of the self - energy ( needed only for the first iteration ) , no broadening factor is utilized . as such , these tails that emerge as the disorder strength",
    "is increased towards @xmath6 are physical tails since the top and bottom of the bands will localize first . to demonstrate this ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare_ws ] a plot of the tdos at @xmath98 and @xmath99 for the box , gaussian , and lorentzian disorder distributions , respectively .",
    "note the @xmath99 frequency is arbitrary but chosen such that it is close to the re - entrance region of the mobility edge . as can be seen from the plots , for the box disorder distribution ,",
    "even though there are small tails , the tdos at @xmath98 and @xmath99 behave alike and differ only in magnitude .",
    "there are no obvious long tails in either frequency ( @xmath98 and 1.3 ) that may mask the detection of the position of the mobility edge energies . however , for the gaussian and lorentzian disorder distributions , there are exponentially long tails especially at @xmath99 that make pinpointing the exact position of the mobility edge energies highly non - trivial .",
    "this should further be understood from the fact that unlike the box disorder distribution , the lorentzian disorder distribution naturally has tails that decay very slowly at infinity , as @xmath100 , such that aside the zeroth moment ( the area under the curve ) , all other higher moments do not even exists .",
    "we note that this difficulty is generic not only to the tmdca but also for any method where the extraction of the trajectories of the mobility edge is based on the tdos .",
    "a notable example is in the kernel polynomial method , which even shows more severe discrepancies ( not shown ) .",
    "this deviation between the tmdca and tmm at higher disorder strengths can also be attributed to the fact that the tmdca , just like the kpm utilizes a finite frequency grid ( which biases more towards the metallic regime ) in contrast to the tmm which calculates the transmission of electrons at fixed energies .",
    "even so , we note that the tmm also has its own shortcomings away from the band center due to the strong fluctuations in the kramer - mackinnon scaling parameter @xmath101 ( see appendix  [ tmm_appendix ] for its definition ) as can be seen from the phase diagrams for the various disorder strengths around the re - entrance regime .",
    "here , we present a detailed study of the anderson localization transition using the recently developed typical medium dynamical cluster approximation ( tmdca ) for the box , gaussian , lorentzian , and binary alloy disorder distributions in three dimensions . for each distribution",
    "we find the tmdca to be a successful , causal , numerically efficient , self - consistent and rapidly convergent method for the study of localization in disordered electron systems .    with our formalism",

    "@xcite for distributions with a finite variance ( box and gaussian ) , we demonstrate that there are extended states outside the unperturbed band .",
    "we further show using the dca ( which includes spatial correlations ) and a variant of the typical medium theory ( which includes spatial correlations but suffers from self - averaging ) , the importance of the effective medium to properly characterize the anderson localization transition .",
    "we also demonstrate the inability of the single - site cpa and the tmt methods to accurately capture the localization and disorder effects in both the average and the typical dos .",
    "we note that the single - site tmt , while being able to qualitatively capture the localization transition , strongly underestimates the extended regions and fails to capture the critical parameters including the mobility edge trajectories and the exponents .",
    "in contrast , the tmdca captures nicely the trajectories of the mobility edge with great improvement in the critical order parameter exponent .",
    "most significantly , the tmdca results are in a quantitative agreement with exact numerical results .",
    "the tmdca formalism is computationally inexpensive and straightforward to implement since it requires only the computer time needed to invert small clusters ( e.g. , @xmath88125 ) , average over the disorder configurations , and iterate to convergence .",
