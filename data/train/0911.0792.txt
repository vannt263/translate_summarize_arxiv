    "clusters of stars are ideal witnesses of past star formation and chemical evolution .",
    "this is because the stars in a cluster outline a sequence in photometric diagrams which can be compared with theoretical models for stellar evolution to infer an age and metallicity for the cluster . this way",
    ", young ( @xmath0 myr ) clusters can be used to investigate the mechanisms of triggering and propagation of star formation in detail and the dependence of star formation on local environmental conditions .",
    "intermediate - age ( @xmath110 gyr ) clusters trace much of the history of galaxies , while old ( @xmath2 gyr ) globular clusters ( gcs ) probe the formation epoch of galaxies .",
    "the ` chemical ' ( really : ` elemental ' ) composition of a cluster is a powerful legacy of the entire history of star formation , stellar evolution , dynamical and interstellar medium ( ism ) processes pre - dating the formation of the cluster .",
    "the cluster age tags this imprint to a specific time in the history of a galactic system .",
    "complications arise from the fact that the position and kinematics of a cluster may no longer be directly connected to its place of origin and birth kinematics . in the milky way",
    ", dynamical heating leads to outward migration away from the disc midplane and the galactic centre .",
    "clusters dissolve over time , and those that survive for many billions of years generally have masses around @xmath3 m@xmath4 .",
    "their formation requires conditions which are uncommon in the present , nearby universe .",
    "in addition , attempts to quantify the star - formation rate are hampered by the uncertain relationship between the conditions under which stars were formed and the number and size of clusters which were produced .",
    "nevertheless , their chemical composition can constrain all of these open issues .",
    "i concentrate on new lines of evidence , emerging in a fast - paced field of research , complementing and complemented by the excellent reviews of gratton _ et al . _  ( 2004 ) and friel ( 1995 ) , freeman & bland  hawthorn ( 2002 ) and brodie & strader ( 2006 ) .",
    "we must first define what we mean by metallicity . in astrophysics , metals are elements heavier than hydrogen ( h ) , helium ( he ) , lithium ( li ) and beryllium ( be ) .",
    "the metallicity is the fraction , in mass , in all these elements combined .",
    "this amounts to at most @xmath5 , is z@xmath6 for the sun , and can be as little as @xmath7 in the most metal - deficient galactic gcs ( and less still in extremely metal - deficient halo field stars ) . in most main - sequence ( ms )",
    "stars , he takes up @xmath8 of the total , with the remaining @xmath9 in h ( where @xmath10 ) .",
    "many metals are very rare and make a negligible contribution to the total",
    ". it would be cumbersome and inaccurate to have to measure the abundances of individual metals and add them all up to arrive at a value for @xmath11 .",
    "it is therefore sensible to pick one metal and use that as a proxy for metallicity . often , iron ( fe ) is used , relative to that of h and benchmarked against the sun , denoted as [ fe / h ] .",
    "fe is common , and its production in supernovae ( sne ) results in a steady increase over time as subsequent generations of stars incorporate the accumulated enrichment by the previous generations .",
    "this scenario may , in fact , be traced more promptly by oxygen ( o ) , which is even more common and relatively easily measured in the ism of other galaxies . yet , different histories will lead to different relative enhancements ( or even depletion ) of the various elements , including o and fe , so there really exists no true single chemical yardstick .",
    "elements heavier than h are synthesized both in stars and in explosions .",
    "differences in yields are generally associated with the temperature or neutron density at which nuclear synthesis takes place . but to speak of a yield in terms of chemical enrichment of the universe , the products must leave the gravitational boundary of their source . in stars , this requires a mechanism of transport through the mantle into the surface layers , followed by mass loss . in explosive events , it requires that the products join the ejecta instead of being encapsulated within a compact remnant ( neutron star , ns , or black hole ) .",
    "the yields from stars generally depend on other parameters in addition to mass and composition , for instance rotation and magnetic fields , which both affect the production rates and mixing efficiencies and possibly also the mass - loss rate .",
    "the physics of mixing and mass loss are not fully understood , and are only incorporated in stellar models in an ad hoc , parameterized way . and some crucial reaction rates are uncertain by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the lifetime of a star is roughly also the delay timescale between its formation and its contribution to chemical enrichment of the ism .",
    "chemical enrichment of subsequent generations of stars is further delayed between injection into the ism and participation in star formation .",
    "table 1 gives a succinct overview of the main protagonists , the ( minimum ) timescales on which they operate and the key contributions they make to chemical enrichment .",
    ".factories of the elements [ cols=\"<,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     agb : asymptotic giant branch , hbb : hot - bottom burning , rgb : red - giant branch .",
    "these elements , with atomic masses near that of fe , are ejected in sne .",
    "in particular the presence of nickel ( ni ) is a tell - tale signature of such events , with @xmath12ni the product of the final nuclear burning stage ( that of silicon , si , by @xmath13 capture ) in massive stars ( @xmath14 m@xmath4 ) .",
    "the decay of @xmath12ni to the cobalt isotope @xmath12co and subsequently to @xmath12fe creates much of the fe released in sne . in type ii sne , much of the ni and fe is locked up in the collapsing core , but very massive ( @xmath15 m@xmath4 ) metal - poor stars explode entirely as a result of pair creation , leaving no remnant .",
    "fe is also produced in large quantities in explosive nucleosynthesis in type ia sne , which are devoid of h as they are detonations or deflagrations of white dwarfs ( wds ) .",
    "all this fe ends up in the ism . because wds are the products of intermediate - mass stars ( 0.58 m@xmath4 ) , enrichment by sne ia is slower ( @xmath16 yr ; raskin _ et al . _",
    "2009 ) than that by sne from massive stars .",
    "a type ia sn likely results from the wd having grown to the chandrasekhar mass limit ( 1.4 m@xmath4 ) by accreting matter from a companion star , or from the merger of two wds .",
    "this additional delay is very uncertain : massive wd progenitors leave wds with masses closer to the chandrasekhar limit , but the mutual separation of the mass donor and receiving wd ( or of the two wds ) , and hence the efficiency of mass transfer ( or orbital degradation ) , may also depend on the birth mass .",
    "the net result is that the galactic disc grew to [ fe / h ] @xmath17 dex through sne from massive stars , after which type ia sne kicked in on a typical delay timescale of @xmath18 gyr .",
    "subsequently , the continued increase in fe content diluted earlier enrichment from massive stars in other elements ( ` q ' ) , decreasing their [ q / fe ] ratios towards zero ( solar ) .",
    "copper ( cu ) and manganese ( mn ) are produced more lavishly in type ia sne .",
    "hence , they are underabundant with respect to scaled - solar abundances by 0.30.7 dex at [ fe / h ] @xmath19 dex , and only reach solar values after prolonged enrichment by type ia sne . other fe - peak elements are titanium ( ti ) , which is easy to measure in stellar spectra , and vanadium ( v ) , which forms easily recognizable molecules in the atmospheres of the coolest m - type giant stars , and chromium ( cr ) .",
    "heavy elements are produced by neutron ( n ) capture , starting with fe ( the ` seed ' nucleus ) .",
    "this proceeds rapidly in the explosive deaths of massive stars , and anything as massive as uranium ( u ) can result .",
    "an excellent tracer of this process is europium ( eu ) .",
    "indeed , in the galaxy , [ eu / fe ] @xmath20 dex up to [ fe / h ] @xmath17 dex , after which it decreases towards solar values , essentially showing the opposite behaviou is produced through @xmath13 capture .",
    "c ( and s - process elements ) is transported to the surface as the convective envelope penetrates the production site as a result of the switch between h- and he - shell burning ( thermal pulsing , tp ) . in subsolar - metallicity stars , this turns the star into a c star as the surface c / o ratio exceeds unity . in massive agb stars ( 48 m@xmath4 ) ,",
    "the bottom of the convection zone is so hot that an incomplete cno cycle operates ( hot - bottom burning : hbb ) : c is converted into n , but not subsequently into o. these stars produce n and deplete c. isotopic changes occur too : for instance , @xmath21o is depleted and the @xmath22c/@xmath23c ratio is reduced .",
    "na , aluminium ( al ) and mg can be synthesized as well _ through _ p - capture , especially at ever lower metallicities : at very low metallicities , @xmath24 , in the most massive agb stars , o is more fully depleted than c , and these stars become c stars even though they do not enrich the universe with c but instead with large amounts of n ( ventura & dantona 2009 ) .",
    "he is produced in all stars @xmath25 m@xmath4 , but it does not necessarily end up in the ism",
    ". one would expect massive agb stars undergoing hbb to yield he .",
    "super - agb stars , which behave like agb stars but proceed to burn c in the core , contribute he as well as enhancing c+n+o ( pumo _ et al . _",
    "their fate as either one wd or electron - capture sn is unclear .",
    "prolific producers are wolf  rayet ( wr ) stars .",
    "these have shed their h envelope as a result of strong stellar winds in their previous phase as an o- or b - type supergiant or possibly after an intermediate phase as a red supergiant ( rsg ) .",
    "their surface layers consist predominantly of he , with either abundant n ( wn ; @xmath26 m@xmath4 ) or c and o ( wc ; @xmath27 m@xmath4 ) .",
    "wr stars also have strong winds and thus enrich the ism with he , as well as n , or c and o. note , however , that if one adds up the lost h , one arrives at more similar enrichments to those contributed by sne of type ii ( @xmath28 m@xmath4 ) .",
    "intermediate in mass between o and ne , fluorine ( f ) is produced in the of - cycle variant of the cno cycle , most likely in intermediate - mass tp  agb stars , as it is destroyed in more massive stars ( lebzelter _ et al . _",
    "2008 ; abia _ et al . _",
    "2009 ) .",
    "care must be taken not to mistake internal chemical processes , happening within the cluster since its formation , for primordial enrichment .",
    "this is a prime concern in old clusters , where the evolved giant stars are so much brighter and hence more readily accessible to spectroscopic investigation than their ms siblings .",
    "such interfering processes can be internal to the star itself , or internal to the cluster but external to the star in question .      in cool giants , `",
    "mixing ' is due to convection , the mode of energy transport from the nuclear production site to the photosphere .",
    "normally , a radiative layer exists between the nuclear burning site and the convective mantle , acting as a buffer . but occasionally , restructuring of the mantle as a consequence of switching nuclear furnace allows the convection zone to penetrate , leading to a ` dredge - up ' episode .",
    "of particular intensity , the third dredge up occurs repeatedly ( briefly , with intervals of typically @xmath29 yr ) during the tp ",
    "agb phase .",
    "this brings c and s - process elements to the surface , creating a c star ( or an s - type star which has c / o@xmath30 and is thus rare ) or a n - enriched star if hbb operates .",
    "it is accompanied by short - lived elements such as technetium ( tc ) , so if tc is seen then the surface enrichment is recent . especially in metal - poor intermediate - mass stars , the c / o ratio on the surface is easily reverted from o to c dominated . because the molecular chemistry of the atmospheres of cool stars ( @xmath31 k ) is largely determined by whatever element is left after formation of carbon monoxide ( co ) , c stars look very different from o - rich red giants , displaying strong c@xmath32 and tio bands , respectively . in cool stars with c / o@xmath33 ,",
    "carbonaceous molecules are still present , most notably ch ( observable as , e.g. , the ` g band ' at 4300  ) and cn ( e.g. , around 3800  ) .    in low - mass stars ( @xmath34 m@xmath4 ) ,",
    "during their ascent of the red - giant branch ( rgb ) , cno - cycle burning in the h shell can drive cno isotopes to their equilibrium values , which are very different from their primordial levels : @xmath22c/@xmath23c @xmath35 ( during agb h - shell burning this ratio is typically around 1520 , with a solar value of @xmath36 ) and @xmath37n and @xmath38o become abundant isotopes . the first dredge up on the rgb is not sufficiently efficient and perhaps absent in metal - poor stars . a noncanonical mixing mechanism",
    "must be operating above the rgb ` bump ' ( around @xmath39 mag , caused by a discontinuity in the molecular weight ) .",
    "rotation , or the thermohaline effect ( a molecular - weight inversion causing buoyancy ; eggleton _ et al . _",
    "2006 ; charbonnel & zahn 2007 ) , have been suggested as its origin .",
    "whatever its cause , it must be more effective at lower metallicity , as @xmath22c/@xmath23c ratios close to the equilibrium value are observed in metal - poor , luminous rgb stars , [ fe / h ] @xmath40 dex , but not in their more metal - rich counterparts ( charbonnel & do nascimento 1998 ) .",
    "li is normally depleted during the first dredge - up episode : pasquini _ et al . _  ( 2005 ; in ngc6752 ) and bonifacio _ et al . _  ( 2007 ; in 47tuc ) provide evidence for a li  na anticorrelation , consistent with the admixture of gas depleted in li and rich in na produced by p - capture reactions",
    ". however , the anticorrelation appears in gcs but not in the field , and may thus result from the gc formation mechanism .",
    "the galactic gc ngc6397 , on the other hand , exhibits a uniform li content across its unevolved population .",
    "rare super - li - rich stars have been found , too , and some unconventional process is required to explain this happening some way up the rgb ( abia _ et al . _  1991 ) .",
    "li enhancement in galactic massive agb stars does not appear to be accompanied by s - process enhancement ( garca  hernndez _ et al . _",
    "2007 ) , while in the magellanic clouds it is ( smith _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) : a metallicity effect .    in stars with radiative mantles ,",
    "other effects can cause modification of the surface chemical abundances . in horizontal - branch ( hb ) stars ( post - rgb , core - he burning giants ) gravitational settling and selective radiative levitation can lead to differentiation of metals , making these stars highly unsuitable for studying primordial enrichment or even later enrichment by external processes .",
    "this is a pity as , for instance , he lines are visible in the spectrum of stars in this temperature regime ( @xmath41 k ) .",
    "more stars of spectral type a display peculiarities ( ` ap ' stars ) , some believed to be due to the acting of magnetic fields ( metallic , ` am ' stars )",
    ".    fast rotation may also induce mixing of the star where it would otherwise not be expected .",
    "this might produce hot stars with a surface enriched in n , as well as c and o. this contributes to the uncertainty about the main producers of n in the early universe : rotating massive stars ( decressin _ et al . _  2007 ) or perhaps massive agb stars ( ventura & dantona 2009 ) ?    finally",
    ", surface chemical abundances may undergo dramatic changes as the star sheds its h - rich mantle , directly exposing the layers underneath in which nuclear burning had taken place previously .",
    "this gives rise , for instance , to post - agb objects enriched in s - process elements . or massive wr stars , which are easily recognized by their very broad emission lines ( no absorption lines at all ) .",
    "the presence of wr stars in a cluster is related to the cluster s age , but may be affected by additional properties of the stars such as their metallicity at birth and rotation rate .",
    "similarly , c stars in a cluster help constrain its age .      in dense stellar systems ,",
    "external pollution by other stars may be relatively important : accretion from a pool of gas , possibly replenished by the winds from other stars , or mass transfer from binary companions , or _ through _ stellar mergers .    in a standard bondi ",
    "lyttleton scenario , the accretion rate from diffuse gas is remarkably well approximated by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the mass of the accreting star , @xmath44 the density of the medium it passes through , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the sound and bulk speed , respectively . in 10 gyr ,",
    "a star of @xmath47 m@xmath4 moving through ism of @xmath48 g @xmath49 ( @xmath30 particle @xmath49 ) and @xmath50 km s@xmath51 at @xmath52 km s@xmath51 will accrete just @xmath53 m@xmath4 .",
    "denser gas has not been found in gcs ( freire _ et al . _  2001",
    "; van loon _",
    "et al . _",
    "kinematically colder populations , with @xmath54 km s@xmath51 only accrete more efficiently from thermodynamically cold gas ( @xmath55 km s@xmath51 ) . in any case",
    ", one would expect all stars to participate in this process and become polluted . thus , accretion from diffuse gas to explain",
    "abundance anomalies in gcs seems a rather contrived scenario .",
    "binary mass transfer is observed in a number of types of systems .",
    "if a ms star accretes mass from the mantle or wind from a c - star red - giant companion , the chemical imprint upon the radiative layers of the ms star is obvious : the ms star turns into a c star as well , at least in appearance , along with the usual s - process signatures such as ba enhancement .",
    "this naturally explains the observations of c stars in gcs which are too faint for tps and the third dredge up to operate , although it is more challenging to explain such c and ba stars found at the tip of the rgb , where the convective mantle would mix and dilute the accreted c with oxygeneous material ( van loon _",
    "et al._2007 ) . to prove that these kinds of enrichments are neither due to binary mass transfer nor to internal nucleosynthesis and mixing",
    ", a consistent pattern must be found along the rgb and preferably also on the ms .",
    "stellar mergers may result from common - envelope systems in which a binary star becomes enveloped by the red - giant mantle of one of the components as it ascends the rgb .",
    "if the cores merge , a more massive star may remain , at a position on the ms higher than the ms turnoff associated with the evolution of single stars in a coeval population .",
    "these ` blue stragglers ' could be mistaken for a younger population , but the absence of corresponding stars at more evolved stages of evolution rules out this possibility .",
    "the total amount of mass lost by a star is reasonably well known ( see also kalirai & richer 2010 ) .",
    "but the exact timing of the mass loss determines the ultimate yields ( the initial mass function , imf , determines the combined yield ) , while the wind speed and momentum determine the degree and timescale of mixing with the surrounding ism ( this also depends on the gravitational field and ism density ) .",
    "agb stars lose mass through slow winds , @xmath5620 km s@xmath51 ( lower speeds at lower metallicity ) and metallicity - independent mass - loss rates of @xmath57 to @xmath58 m@xmath4 yr@xmath51 ( van loon 2006 ) .",
    "these winds are easily retained within massive gcs , but may escape from clusters lacking sufficient mass ( be it baryonic or dark ) .",
    "rsg winds are relatively slow too ( @xmath59 km s@xmath51 ) .",
    "stars of @xmath6040 m@xmath4 do not reach the rsg phase .",
    "these o- and b - type supergiants , and wr stars , or similar kinds of progenitors or descendants of rsgs , have much faster winds ( @xmath61 km s@xmath51 ) .",
    "sne have extremely fast ( @xmath62 km s@xmath51 ) and energetic outflows , which sweep away any gas present in their vicinity . at some distance",
    "it will run out of steam and stall , but the combined effect of several sne creates a large cavity in the ism .",
    "various types of sne are still poorly understood , for instance types ib / c ( probably resulting from wr stars ) and ii ",
    "the fate of super - agb stars is unknown .",
    "if they blow up they may efficiently spread their enriched material over large distances , but otherwise enrichment of the ism takes place mainly through their slow winds .",
    "strong stellar winds and sne are generally found to compress the surrounding ism , and star formation is often seen surrounding the blown cavities .",
    "similarly , radiative feedback from luminous , hot stars can induce a wind emanating from a star cluster , and also create an ionization front which may induce the collapse of molecular cloud material and thereby trigger star formation . yet , convincing evidence of actual triggering of new star formation as a result of the mechanical or radiative feedback is surprisingly sparse ( cf .",
    "chu _ et al . _",
    "2005 ; oliveira _ et al . _",
    "the younger generation does not coincide spatially with the central cluster , and it is doubtful that the feedback and subsequent star formation ( possibly from chemically enriched gas ) ultimately results in a cluster with a composite population of stars .",
    "the galactic system of open clusters ( ocs ) is fairly well understood .",
    "their metallicities are around solar or somewhat lower and they generally compare well to the metal - rich end of the galactic - disc field - star population .",
    "this is expected , as ocs have ages typically less than a gyr and thus formed from material that had been chemically enriched over many gyr .",
    "the reason for the abundance of such relatively ` young ' ocs is not a recent burst in their formation , but rather the dispersal of older ocs due mainly to evaporation of stars in combination with continuous dynamical relaxation , and tidal effects within the galactic gravitational potential ( see also de grijs 2010 ; larsen 2010 ) .    no age  metallicity relation is present for ocs ( cf .",
    "pancino _ et al .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 1 , where slightly supersolar - metallicity ocs are seen at all ages , and the clearly subsolar - metallicity ocs of relatively old age are displaced within the milky way .",
    "indeed , metallicity gradients are seen ( pancino _ et al .",
    "_ 2009 ; and references therein ) with respect to galactocentric distance and distance to the galactic midplane , and similar gradients are seen in the cluster ages ( figure 1 ) .",
    "this is not unexpected , as clusters , like field stars , migrate away from the peak in the mass density as a result of encounters with gravitationally disturbing bodies ( in the case of ocs , these are likely molecular clouds and/or spiral arms ) .",
    "the lack of young clusters at large galactocentric distances suggests a lack of recent in situ star formation , with consequentially lower rates of chemical evolution , but this may be resolved by more systematic searches for young ocs outside the solar circle .",
    "the larger ocs have close - to - solar metallicity , with metal - poor ocs  invariably older  being more compact ( figure 1 ) .",
    "this may be a selection effect , as diffuse ocs dissolve over time . yet massive ( @xmath62 m@xmath4 ) , young ( @xmath63 yr ) ocs are only found in the inner regions of the galaxy , which suggests that their formation requires stronger gravitational confinement of the molecular cloud environment .",
    "examples are the well - known arches and quintuplet clusters and westerlund 1 , harbouring very massive stars including wr stars , and a number of recently - discovered ( in infrared surveys ) ocs with large populations of rsgs ( figer _ et al . _  2006",
    "; davies _ et al . _  2007",
    "they have near - solar metallicities , as expected from their age and location in the inner parts of the galactic disc .",
    "( it is well - known that the sun is rather metal - rich for its age of 4.6 gyr , but also that chemical enrichment in the galactic disc has proceeded very slowly , if at all , since the sun s formation .",
    "a reason may be the ongoing accretion of gas of subsolar metallicity from the halo , diluting chemical enrichment . )    the massive cluster ngc6791 ( see also below ) is considered an oc , but being as old and ( supersolar ) metal - rich as it is , and given its location in the inner galactic disc , it is likely associated with the end of the bulge - formation epoch . its outward migration has also been suggested by boesgaard _",
    "et al . _  ( 2009 ) .",
    "gcs do not contain stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath64 dex .",
    "stars much more metal - deficient are found in the halo , so either gcs did not form at those early , metal - poor times , or they have not survived , either because they were not massive enough or because they were subjected to particularly hostile conditions early on .",
    "this means that the present - day , surviving gcs are not the first stellar systems to have formed , and that their chemical imprint is testimony of the earlier , ` lost ' generation ( or generations ) .    the galactic gc system has long been known to be composed of two main subsystems , one associated with a halo - like distribution and kinematics , and the other with a more flattened and kinematically more ordered distribution : the latter population is referred to as a ` bulge ' population",
    "this is illustrated in figure 2 , where the metallicity distribution is clearly bimodal with peaks on either side of [ fe / h ] @xmath65 dex .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is no correlation whatsoever between mass ( by proxy of absolute visual magnitude , @xmath66 ) and metallicity .",
    "halo and bulge gcs are similar in mass .    a change in the hb ratio from positive , if a pronounced hot hb is present , to negative occurs among the halo gcs ( figure 2 ) .",
    "it is uniformly negative among bulge gcs . between [ fe / h ] @xmath67 and @xmath68 dex , gcs",
    "are found with both negative and positive hb ratios , giving rise to the so - called ` second - parameter problem ' .",
    "in fact , the metallicity at which this occurs is somewhat lower for less massive gcs ( perhaps this is a bias due to the paucity of hot - hb stars ) .",
    "indeed , the transition in hb ratio is abrupt for the top two magnitudes in @xmath66 , at [ fe / h ] @xmath69 dex .",
    "the most metal - rich gcs that show a hot hb have [ fe / h ] @xmath69 dex even among the less massive gcs , at @xmath70 mag .",
    "halo gcs extend to lower central luminosity ( a proxy for mass ) density than bulge gcs ( figure 2 ) .",
    "these may be dissolving but given that they have persisted for so long , a tantalizing alternative is that they contain a modest amount of dark matter ( making up for the lack of _ luminous _ mass density ) .",
    "there is a trend for higher metallicity at higher central density , but this is very weak indeed .",
    "there does not appear to be any correlation between metallicity or central density on the one hand , and ellipticity of the gc on the other , so the amount of angular momentum inherited from their formation appears to be entirely random .",
    "the bimodal metallicity distribution is linked to the halo and bulge division .",
    "the galactic spatial distributions indeed exhibit a sharp division , at [ fe / h ] @xmath67 dex when considering galactocentric distance or [ fe / h ] @xmath71 dex in terms of galactoplanar distance ( figure 2 ) , which , curiously , is a few dex lower than the location of the division in the metallicity distribution .",
    "the halo gcs venture to well over 100 kpc distance , while the bulge gcs stay within 20 kpc from the galactic centre .",
    "both systems are flattened , with galactoplanar distances being smaller than their galactocentric equivalents . especially the bulge",
    "gcs stay within just a few kpc from the galactic plane , but halo gcs also often have orbits very close to the midplane .",
    "the less massive gcs , in both systems , are distributed more widely .",
    "this is a clear signature of mass segregation within the gc systems .",
    "fraix  burnet _ et al .",
    "_  ( 2009 ) , on the basis of a clever multivariate analysis , deduced an age ",
    "metallicity relation for the halo gcs , from [ fe / h ] @xmath72 dex 12 gyr ago to [ fe / h ] @xmath67 dex 9 gyr ago .",
    "note , however , that their data are also consistent with a more rapid increase in metallicity @xmath7311 gyr ago , from [ fe / h ] @xmath74 to @xmath75 dex .",
    "this is also the age interval in which the bulge gcs seem to have appeared on stage , having generally higher metallicites[fe / h ] @xmath71 to @xmath76 dex  than halo gcs of similar age .",
    "fraix  burnet _ et al .",
    "_  ( 2009 ) further confirmed earlier evidence that galactic gcs differ from local group dwarf galaxies in having higher [ @xmath13/fe ] ratios .",
    "halo gcs are indistinguishable from halo field stars in this respect .",
    "bulge gcs lack the dilution of @xmath13 elements by further enrichment with fe from type ia sne that characterizes field stars in the galactic disc .",
    "this reaffirms the notion that bulge gcs must have formed , and been chemically enriched , rapidly .",
    "sparse data exist for the most metal - rich gcs ( [ fe / h ] @xmath77 dex ) . in liller1 , ngc6553 and ngc6528 , [ ca / fe ] is as high as for metal - poor gcs ( gratton _ et al . _",
    "2004 ) and thus different from field stars and ocs .",
    "there is no dependence of [ ca / fe ] on galactocentric distance .",
    "ngc6528 is also the only metal - rich gc with measured [ mn / fe ] , which is also as low as that in metal - poor gcs .",

    "it is not uncommon for cool giant stars in galactic gcs to exhibit strong cn bands .",
    "sometimes , a clear bimodality between cn - strong and cn - weak stars is observed ( e.g. , van loon _",

    "the bimodality suggests that some stars may have been affected by n enrichment while others were not , and the lack of this signature in field stars suggests that the enrichment is a particular feature of ( galactic ) gcs .",
    "na correlates with ( c)n , suggesting a p - capture process perhaps related to agb stars of relatively low masses . in 47tuc and ngc6752 , neither mg , si , ca , fe nor ba appeared to vary ( cottrell & da costa 1981 ) , but al also varies at medium  low metallicity and mg also at low metallicity , so the n producers were probably slightly different , depending on their metallicity or mass , if the mass range of the polluters correlates with the gc metallicity .",
    "the sum of c+n+o generally remains constant .",
    "et al._(2009 ) found that , as c+n+o increases in rotating massive agb stars , nonrotating massive agb stars are more likely to be responsible for n enhancement in gcs , but they consider this awkward as one may expect gc stars to rotate faster , not slower , than in the field .",
    "there is also no obvious reason for a bimodality in the rotation rates , which might mean that the polluters were never part of the gc .",

    "the explanation for the o  na anticorrelation is the production of na in the cno cycle , and in associated cycles at higher temperatures ( involving , progressively , ne , mg and al ) .",

    "stellar feedback , possibly in combination with an active galactic nucleus outflow , would have driven gas into intergalactic space .",

    "this would have induced the gravitational unbinding of the central stellar system , with subsequent migration of its stars and gcs into the halo , a ` popping ' proto - galaxy , only to be retained within the confines of the dark - matter potential .",
    "the downsizing of clusters over time is intriguing , and suggests that even the extremely metal - poor halo stars might have formed in a few superclusters which quickly disintegrated and dispersed , possibly as a result of dramatic mass loss due to winds and sne ( especially if the imf was top - heavy )",
    ". a single ` hyper'-cluster would be less consistent with the large star - to - star variations seen at [ fe / h ] @xmath89 dex between r- and s - process enrichment .    a second phase of gas accretion , possibly resulting from the previously ejected gas cooling and falling back ,",
    "might then have given rise to the rapid formation of the bulge and bulge gcs in the nucleus of the fledgling galaxy .",

    "et al . _  ( 2007 ) found a similar rotation rate for all populations in @xmath99cen , and no radial differences were found in ngc1851 ( milone _ et al . _",
    "2009_b _ ) .",
    "memory may have been erased through dynamical evolution of the merged system , or mergers take place preferentially involving systems that share similar kinematics ( possibly increasing the effectiveness of dynamical friction , for instance , in co - rotating systems as opposed to counterrotating systems ) , or there never was a merger .",
    "mergers do not explain an extended period of enrichment either , only possibly a secondary population , while a third population , i.e. , a third merger , would be highly unlikely .",
    "if one could separate the primary and secondary populations , they would not each look like gcs in their own right , certainly not the secondary population ( there are no solely n - rich clusters ) .",
    "self - enrichment is an attractive scenario to explain abundance patterns which are only seen in gcs and not in the field , but how viable is it ? if not through their fast winds , the sn deaths of massive stars surely remove ism from the gc .",
    "but the winds of intermediate - mass stars are much slower , in particular in metal - poor systems , and within the escape velocity of massive , compact gcs .",
    "could the agb ejecta on their own have formed the next generation of stars ?",
    "remember that perhaps as much as half of the stellar content of massive galactic gcs might have formed in subsequent epochs ( cf .",
    "@xmath99cen , ngc6441 , m22 , ngc1851 ) .",
    "one can easily estimate that stars in the mass range 28 m@xmath4 yield about half as much mass in the form of ejecta as there would be in stars in the approximate mass range 0.30.8 m@xmath4 . to form stars from this at about the maximum efficiency , @xmath140% ,",
    "would thus generate a second generation of stars of about 10% in number compared to the first generation ( cf .",
    "yi 2009 ) . to form an n - enriched population similar or greater in number than a co - existing , n - poor(er ) population",
    "would push this scenario to its limits : it already comprises a generous range in agb stars and as a consequence also a gyr age difference .",
    "accreted gas may add to agb ejecta within the gc before forming stars .",
    "indeed , ventura & dantona ( 2009 ) confirm that agb ejecta must be diluted by pristine gas to reproduce the o ",
    "na anticorrelation .",
    "the additional gas may come from the massive stars in the same generation of agb polluters ( in which case it would also be enhanced in fe - peak , @xmath13 and r - process elements ) , or it may be remnant gas from which that gc population had formed in the first place . alternatively , it may come from elsewhere , in which case the enrichment of the second generation of stars would bear no relation to that of the first generation . while this might help explain the strange temporal and chemical ` order ' of the subpopulations in @xmath99cen , it disagrees with the absence of star - to - star variations in fe content in most gcs .",
    "a further challenge for the self - enrichment scenario is that clusters do not remain gas - rich for long , so it is difficult to envisage agb ejecta to accumulate within the cluster over a gyr or so .",
    "no gas - rich clusters are known except very young ones , and even then the gas usually surrounds , rather than permeates , the cluster . in young clusters ,",
    "sne  if not fast stellar winds  drive out the gas .",
    "old clusters have little gas , if any , too , despite having had long to produce it .",
    "interaction with galactic halo gas is a likely removal mechanism ( van loon _",
    "et al . _  2009",
    "so , multiple populations in gcs are likely to have arisen not from gas accumulation but from gas accretion , probably quite suddenly in the form of a cooling flow ( cf.bekki & norris 2006 ) .",
    "this is corroborated by the central condensation of the metal - rich subpopulations in @xmath99cen ( bellini _ et al .",
    "this explains the variety of gcs and the difficulty to present a unified chemical evolution picture for all gcs .",
    "it has been suggested that nonconservative mass transfer in massive binaries could provide enough interstellar gas for subsequent star formation , and that this gas is enriched in he , n , na and al and depleted in c , o and mg ( de mink _ et al .",
    "although this can explain some of the chemical - abundance patterns found in gcs , the majority of massive stars must participate in this scenario for it to contribute significantly and it does not explain gyr delays in star formation .",
    "@xmath99cen , with its retrograde orbit , was suggested to be the nuclear remnant of a dissolved dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy .",
    "m54 is , in fact , a massive gc at the heart of the sgrdsph , which is currently being disrupted in spectacular fashion .",
    "attempts to build a chemical evolution model based upon this scenario invoke a @xmath96 m@xmath4 system , of which 1% survives in the form of the present - day gc ( bekki & freeman 2003 ; romano _ et al .",
    "the attraction of a more massive stellar system as the birthplace of gcs is that the deeper gravitational potential could retain more ejecta , but also that these ejecta could come from a larger population of stars that never did nor will form part of the gc .",
    "self - enrichment scenarios indeed require the gc to be embedded in a larger system ( renzini 2008 ) .",
    "the preferential loss of low - mass , older stars in the early dynamical phases could then also have caused the comparatively large remaining further - enriched populations ( dercole _ et al .",
    "_ 2008 ) .",
    "but there are problems with this origin : dsph galaxies show different abundance patterns ( geisler _ et al . _  2007",
    ") : the r - process is relatively more important in dsphs .",
    "several other gcs in addition to m54 are associated with the sgrdsph , also showing chemical inhomogeneity : where did they get that from , if they are not nucleated ?",
    "if all gcs had formed in dsph galaxies , enough stars would have been shed to supply the halo and disc with most of their present stars .",
    "this is clearly not the case for the more enriched disc .",
    "the central concentration of the bulge gcs is also inconsistent with minor mergers and perhaps the result of star formation triggered by a major merger ( griffen _ et al .",
    "_ 2009 ) .",
    "it has also been suggested that the very distant ( @xmath141 kpc ) gcs might have originated elsewhere , for instance , the metal - poor , spatially very extended gc ngc2419 ( van den bergh & mackey 2004 ) in which ripepi _ et al . _  ( 2007 ) find no spread in metallicity and no spread in the branches , except an extended hb .",
    "mgc1 , a very remote gc in the m31 halo , may be similar ( mackey _ et al._2009 ) .",
    "pal3 looks like an archetypal gc , with abundance patterns similar to many other gcs , but different from those in dsph galaxies ( koch _ et al . _",
    "curiously , the @xmath142 m@xmath4 required for the formation and self - enrichment of @xmath99cen is similar to the potential total mass associated with pal4 and its hi cloud ( van loon _",
    "et al . _",
    "could the putative larger systems within which gcs formed be largely dark ?",
    "a ` halo ' has been discovered around ngc1851 ( olszewski _ et al . _",
    "2009 ) : could it have a dark - matter halo too ?",
    "could dark - matter haloes be the cause of the large extent of ngc2419 and mgc1 ?",
    "( 2009 ) show that the distant gcs may indeed have kept dark haloes .",
    "( gc dark haloes may only become noticeable beyond the standard tidal radius . )",
    "in the briefest of summaries , one might say that above a certain mass ( of the molecular cloud from which it formed , or perhaps rather of an associated dark - matter component ) the formation of a cluster takes enough time for chemical enrichment to take place during the formation of subsequent generations of its stars .",
    "such clusters foremostly probe the conditions of their formation . at lower masses ,",
    "clusters are formed essentially instantaneously as a single , homogeneous population .",
    "such clusters are more unique probes of the star - formation and chemical - enrichment history of their host ( taking into account cluster dynamics and dispersal ) .    to make progress , more complete abundance measurements ( he ! ) are needed , preferably in ms stars ( not he ) , also in the less massive and more distant gcs and especially the metal - poor ones to make a more direct connection to the formation of the halo .",
    "the interpretation of such measurements remains problematic : more precise age determinations are needed , distinguishing formation epochs within gcs and between gcs differing by @xmath143 gyr .",
    "also , yields of individual elements are not reliable in the quantitative detail needed to reconstruct the rapid formation of old galactic gcs .",
    "soon , clusters in dwarf and spiral galaxies throughout the local group will be subjected to similar chemical analysis as galactic clusters have been , both through photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "environments may become accessible which resemble the conditions in which the galactic gcs we see today were formed , such as those of interacting galaxies , both nearby and high - redshift ( hence historic ) starbursts and star - forming galaxies with ism metal deficiencies typical of galactic gcs , for instance izw18 .    as we find that we can not measure directly what happened in the past , or that there are too few clusters with which to describe their population",
    ", we may need a theoretical framework to constrain the freedom of our imagination .",
