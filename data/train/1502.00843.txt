    "in @xcite , smale introduced the solenoid attractor into dynamics as an example of indecomposable hyperbolic non - wondering set .",

    "it also has a geometric model , as the nested intersections of handlebodies .    for a 3manifold @xmath4 , many of these attractors can be realized by the geometric models with suitable automorphisms @xmath5 .",
    "but for most cases the realizations will not be global .",
    "global means that the non - wondering set @xmath6 is the union of solenoid attractors and repellers . here",
    "a repeller of @xmath0 is an attractor of @xmath7 . by standard arguments in dynamics",
    ", one can show that if we require @xmath6 consists of solenoid attractors and repellers , then there must be exactly one attractor and one repeller .",
    "and @xmath0 is like a translation on @xmath4 .",
    "motivated by the study in morse theory and smale s work in dynamics , the following question was suggested in @xcite by jiang , ni and wang who studied this global realization question for smale solenoids .",
    "* question :* when does a 3manifold admit an automorphism whose non - wandering set consists of solenoid attractors and repellers ?    in @xcite , they showed that for a closed orientable 3manifold @xmath4 , there is a diffeomorphism @xmath8 with the non - wandering set @xmath6 a union of finitely many smale solenoids if and only if @xmath4 is a lens space @xmath9 with @xmath10 , namely @xmath4 has heegaard genus one and is not @xmath11 .",
    "they also showed that the @xmath0 constructed in the if part is @xmath12stable , but is not structurally stable .",
    "as in the opinion of @xcite , a manifold @xmath4 admitting a dynamics @xmath0 such that @xmath6 consists of one hyperbolic attractor and one hyperbolic repeller presents a symmetry of the manifold with certain stability .",
    "the simplest example is the sphere , which admits a dynamics @xmath0 such that @xmath6 consists of exactly two hyperbolic fixed points , a sink and a source .",
    "lens spaces give us more such examples when we consider more complicated attractors .",
    "it is believed by jiang , ni and wang that many more 3manifolds admit such symmetries if we replace the smale solenoids by the williams solenoids .",
    "as special cases , wang asked whether the poincar s homology 3sphere admits such a symmetry ?",
    "what about hyperbolic 3manifolds ?",
    "similar with the discussion in @xcite , in @xcite , ma and yu showed that for a closed orientable 3manifold @xmath4 , if there is a @xmath5 such that @xmath6 consists of williams solenoids , whose defining handlebodies have genus @xmath13 , then the heegaard genus @xmath14 .",
    "on the other hand , to construct such @xmath4 and @xmath0 , they introduced the alternating heegaard splitting which is a genus two splitting and admits a so called alternating heegaard diagram ( see definition [ alterd ] ) .",
    "they showed that if @xmath4 admits an alternating heegaard splitting , then there is a @xmath0 such that @xmath6 consists of two williams solenoids , whose defining handlebodies have genus two . as an interesting example",
    ", they showed that the truncated - cube space ( see @xcite ) , whose fundamental group is the extended triangle group of order 48 , admits an alternating heegaard splitting .",
    "the motivation of this paper is to find further such examples . as special cases",
    ", we will show that the poincar s homology 3sphere and many hyperbolic 3manifolds admit such `` symmetries with certain stability '' .",
    "hence we give a partial answer to the questions asked by wang .",
    "concretely , let @xmath15 denote the seifert fibred spaces , with base @xmath16 and three singular fibres having invariants @xmath17 .",

    "also there are infinitely many hyperbolic 3manifolds admitting such splittings . for these 3manifolds there exist @xmath5 such that @xmath6 consist of two williams solenoids .",
    "in fact , we can find all the alternating heegaard diagrams on a genus two orientable surface .",
    "these diagrams can be determined by integral vectors @xmath27 , which satisfy @xmath28 and the greatest common divisor @xmath29 .",
    "the 3manifolds in theorem [ mas ] come from special diagrams .    on the other hand , having an alternating heegaard splitting is a strong restriction to genus two 3manifolds . as it is pointed in @xcite , if @xmath4 admits an alternating heegaard splitting , then @xmath30 .",
    "hence we can not apply the result in @xcite to the poincar s homology 3sphere .",
