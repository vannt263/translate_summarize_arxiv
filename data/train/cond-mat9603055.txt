    "<S> an explanation is given for the observed magnetic - field dependence of the low - temperature specific heat coefficient of yb~4~as~3~. it is based on a recently developed model for that material which can explain the observed heavy - fermion behaviour . according to it the yb^3+^-ions are positioned in a net of parallel chains with an effective spin coupling of the order of @xmath0 . the magnetic - field dependence can be understood by including a weak magnetic coupling @xmath1 between adjacent chains . </S>",
    "<S> the data require a ratio @xmath2 . in that case </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results can be reproduced very well by the theory .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section ] ] -    the low - carrier compound yb~4~as~3~ which belongs to the rare - earth pnictide family has been subject of extensive experimental investigation caused by its intriguing low - temperature anomalies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it shows evidence for a ` heavy - fermion ' type behaviour below a characteristic temperature @xmath3 , notably a large @xmath4-coefficient of about @xmath5 for the specific heat . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> the carrier concentration is extremely small , approximately @xmath6 holes per formula unit below @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this excludes a conventional kondo - mechanism as origin of the low - energy excitations leading to the large @xmath4-value .    </S>",
    "<S> the scenario proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is quite different from that of a kondo system . </S>",
    "<S> the crystal has the anti - th~3~p~4~-structure , and the space group is i43d . </S>",
    "<S> the yb - ions occupy four systems of parallel chains oriented along the space diagonals of a cube ( body - centred cubic rod packing )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a structural phase transition at room temperature changes the high - temperature homogeneous mixed - valent state of yb~4~as~3~ ( @xmath8 ) to a charge ordered state where the @xmath9 yb^3+^-holes are confined to one of the four chain systems , e.g , parallel @xmath10-chains . </S>",
    "<S> the particular ordering of yb^3+^-ions was confirmed clearly by perturbed angular - correlation ( pac ) measurements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this state has almost half - filled hole bands which are subject to strong on - site coulomb correlations , effectively described by a t - j model . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the low - energy excitations essential for the specific heat are the magnetic excitations of an antiferromagnetic quasi - one - dimensional ` @xmath11 ' heisenberg chain ( @xmath12 is the pseudospin corresponding to the lowest kramers doublet of yb^3+^ ) . </S>",
    "<S> this model proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite was beautifully confirmed by the inelastic neutron - scattering results of kohgi et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they show that low - temperature magnetic excitations in yb~4~as~3~ are very well described by the one - dimensional spin wave spectrum , @xmath13 , of des cloizeaux and pearson  @xcite where q is the wave number in @xmath10-direction and @xmath14 the distance of yb^3+^ ions along the chain . </S>",
    "<S> this also leads naturally to a linear specific heat for @xmath15 . from the maximum observed spin - wave energy of @xmath16 at @xmath17 one obtains @xmath18 in good agreement with the energy scale @xmath7 estimated from the value of  @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> however there is still one major challenge to the validity of the model proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . concerning the dependence of @xmath4 on an applied magnetic field @xmath19 </S>",
    "<S> , one would expect deviations from @xmath20 of the order @xmath21 , i.e. , about @xmath22 at @xmath23 uniformly for all temperatures with @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> experiments by helfrich et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite revealed a quite different behaviour : above @xmath25 changes in @xmath4 are indeed small . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , at @xmath26 the field dependence of @xmath27 is dramatic . </S>",
    "<S> already at @xmath23 its value is strongly suppressed in conflict with the above argument . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that an additional energy scale much smaller than @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) must be present in yb~4~as~3~.    it is the purpose of this letter to show that the spin - chain model for yb~4~as~3~ is well capable of explaining the unexpected results of helfrich et al . for the present purpose we may neglect deviations from perfect charge ordering or half filling which is only important for the transport properties . </S>",
    "<S> the additional energy scale which the results in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite suggest is associated with anisotropy gaps of the magnetic excitations caused by interchain coupling @xmath1 of the parallel yb^3+^-spin chains . </S>",
    "<S> the complete excitation spectrum of a trigonal antiferromagnetically coupled chain system is calculated and it is shown how the linear specific - heat term and its field dependence arises . a comparison with the data of helfrich et al .  </S>",
    "<S> allows to estimate the magnitude of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> proposals for magnetic resonance experiments are made .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that in one spatial dimension , there can not be any long - range spin ordering , but , according to calculations on the spin-1/2 heisenberg chain  @xcite , the spin - spin correlation function decays slowly , @xmath30 , i.e. , the correlation length is infinite . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore model yb~4~as~3~ as if the spins were antiferromagnetically ordered and apply linear spin - wave theory , neglecting disorder - induced corrections .    </S>",
    "<S> we transform the crystal coordinate system of the charge - ordered state to a new basis with a hexagonal unit cell where the @xmath10-direction now is oriented along the c - axis , i.e. , it transforms to the @xmath31-direction . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the interchain coupling by a parameter @xmath32 , we describe yb~4~as~3~ with a hamiltonian of the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the ratio of the antiferromagnetic exchange constants perpendicular and parallel to the c - axis , and @xmath35 is the applied magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> all energies are in units of @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> we parameterize the anisotropic exchange of the system by introducing a parameter @xmath36 describing a single - ion easy - plane anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the symbols @xmath37 and @xmath38 imply summation over nearest - neighbour bonds along and perpendicular to the c - axis .    </S>",
    "<S> starting point of the calculation is the classical nel - state . </S>",
    "<S> perpendicular to the c - direction , the spins are situated on a trigonal lattice - structure , subdivided into three interpenetrating sublattices . </S>",
    "<S> these sublattices are stacked antiferromagnetically along the c - direction . </S>",
    "<S> the ordered system thus contains six sublattices @xmath39 , numbered with @xmath40 within one plane perpendicular to the c - axis , and with @xmath41 in c - direction . in order to describe the nel - state properly , </S>",
    "<S> we perform coordinate transformations on each sublattice @xmath42 such that each @xmath43 points into the local @xmath44-direction . </S>",
    "<S> parametrizing these transformations by polar and azimuthal angles @xmath45 and @xmath46 , we apply a holstein - primakoff transformation on the spins and retain only the constant and bilinear parts of the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> after fourier transforming @xmath47 , we diagonalize it by a bogoliubov - transformation . </S>",
    "<S> the diagonal form of @xmath47 then reads @xmath48 @xmath49 contains constants arising from a rearrangement of the bilinear terms of @xmath47 , and @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) is the fourier transform of the holstein - primakoff boson @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) on the sublattice @xmath42 . @xmath54 </S>",
    "<S> contains the classical part of @xmath47 , i.e , the exact hamiltonian for @xmath55 . minimizing it with respect to the angles @xmath56 and @xmath57 yields the ground - state spin configuration of ( [ eqn : h_bilinear ] )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of quantum corrections to the ground - state energy may be important for some cases  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> if the applied field @xmath58 does not break the rotational symmetry of ( [ eqn : h_bilinear ] ) in the limit @xmath59 , i.e , for @xmath58 parallel to the c - axis , the nel - state is made up of two antiferromagnetically stacked triangular lattices . within these lattices , </S>",
    "<S> the spins of the three sublattices lie on the surface of a cone ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) with the axis parallel to the field ( the c - axis ) and an apex angle @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - wave dispersion is given by @xmath63 \\rho_l(\\mathbf q)&=&\\frac{1}{3}\\left (          \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{q_x}{2}-\\phi_l\\right )          \\vphantom{\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}q_y}{2}\\right)}\\right . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , with a magnetic field perpendicular to the c - axis , one obtains for a small single - ion anisotropy @xmath64 a so - called umbrella - type spin configuration for @xmath65 . in the umbrella - phase , the spins ca nt out of the c - plane  they lie on the surface of two cones with the axis parallel to the field direction , but different apex angles . since in this case </S>",

    "<S> , the scale is set by the intrachain coupling , which fits the neutron scattering data on yb~4~as~3~ if we set @xmath68 , rescaling by a factor of @xmath69 according to the bethe - ansatz result . in the directions transverse to the c - axis , </S>",
    "<S> the scale of the dispersion of the spin - wave modes is given by @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> there are three modes becoming soft at the @xmath71-point , corresponding to the continuous degeneracy of the ground state with respect to rotations of all spins by the same angle around an arbitrary axis .    upon applying a magnetic field , </S>",
    "<S> this degeneracy is lifted , and the corresponding modes acquire a finite frequency at the @xmath71-point . for an arbitrary small but finite anisotropy @xmath64 , we have still one goldstone mode if the field is applied parallel to the c - axis , corresponding to the independence of the ground state with respect to rotations around that axis , see figure  [ fig : sw]b . for a field direction perpendicular to the c - axis , </S>",
    "<S> a gap opens in the entire brillouin zone . for @xmath72 , </S>",
    "<S> the value of the gap is @xmath73 . in figures  [ fig : </S>",

    "<S> the crystal behaves `` three - dimensional '' , i.e. , @xmath81 . if @xmath82 , the @xmath83-dependence becomes linear , @xmath84 , because then interchain - excitations are thermally populated , and only the quasi - one - dimensional intrachain - excitations contribute . in figure  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : goh ] we show the field dependence of the @xmath4-coefficient at @xmath85 ( solid lines ) and @xmath86 ( dashed line ) . in a magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> parallel to the chains , @xmath4 is reduced by a factor of @xmath87 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , there is still the above - mentioned zero - energy mode giving the main contribution to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> if the field direction points perpendicular to the chains , @xmath4 decreases rapidly as a function of @xmath58 due to the opening of the gap in @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> this rapid decrease compares quite well with the experiment  the experimental values are drawn as open circles in the plot  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> note the logarithmic scale on the ordinate.,width=264 ]    at temperatures @xmath88 , the impact of @xmath89 on @xmath4 is almost completely suppressed , see the dotted line in figure  [ fig : goh ] . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the experimental behaviour of @xmath90 at sufficiently large fields , this provides us with an order of magnitude for the interchain coupling , i.e. , we have @xmath91 in order to describe the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the strong dependence of the @xmath4-coefficient on @xmath32 is shown in figure  [ fig : god ] . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 decreases by almost four orders of magnitude upon variation of @xmath32 from zero to one , i.e. , were @xmath92 , the characteristic heavy - fermion behaviour of would not be present .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the spin - chain model for yb~4~as~3~ proposed in @xcite and its extension discussed here is in excellent aggreement with the neutron scattering results of kohgi et al .  and the field dependence of the @xmath4-coefficient found by helfrich et al . </S>",
    "<S> in particular it explains very well why this field dependence sets in only at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to a new energy scale @xmath93 set by the anisotropy gaps in the excitation spectrum which are caused by the interchain coupling . from the behaviour of @xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> one would obtain @xmath94 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> it would however be impossible to directly observe the branches of excitation propagating transversely to the chain direction ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sw ] ) by neutron scattering . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore suggest that magnetic resonance methods which could determine the @xmath71-point excitation energies would be very helpful in determining @xmath1 and especially @xmath64 more accurately . although yb~4~as~3~ is semimetallic this should not be impossible since the residual resistivity ( about @xmath95 ) is quite large in this compound . </S>"
