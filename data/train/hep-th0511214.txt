    "quantum effects play a crucial role during inflation . in particular , they are responsible for the self - reproducing behavior of the universe also known as `` eternal inflation ''  @xcite . in this regime , the quantum fluctuations are so important that they can dominate the classical dynamics and , therefore , treating them properly becomes mandatory . technically , this is a difficult task especially when it is necessary to take into account the backreaction of the quantum field on the geometry .",
    "stochastic inflation  @xcite aims at providing a formalism where the previous difficulties can be partially circumvented . in the stochastic inflation approach ,",
    "one is mainly interested in the evolution of a coarse - grained field , typically the original scalar field averaged over a hubble patch , and the quantum effects are modeled by a stochastic noise originating from the small - scale fourier modes .",
    "consequently , the dynamics of the coarse - grained field is controlled by a langevin equation .",
    "then , endowed with a solution of this equation , one can compute the probability density function of the field and the various correlation functions .",
    "even if stochastic inflation simplifies the calculation of the quantum effects , the langevin equation remains difficult to solve ( without , of course , relying on numerical computations ) .",
    "the case without backreaction ( in a de sitter background ) has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite where it has been shown that solutions for an arbitrary potential can be obtained .",
    "the case with backreaction is clearly much more complicated and something can be said about the solution only for very specific potentials .",
    "the usual approach is applicable when the inflaton potential is such that an exact solution exists for some power of the field .",
    "then , in order to obtain the stochastic field itself and its various correlation functions , an expansion in terms of the coupling constant of the potential is performed .",
    "explicit examples of this approach can be , for instance , found in refs .",
    "@xcite and more recently in ref .",
    "@xcite and are briefly discussed in the following .",
    "the main point is that it is first necessary to obtain a solution to be subsequently able to perform the expansion .",
    "this is the reason why the applicability of the method is severely limited .    in this article , we present a method based on a perturbative expansion in the stochastic noise , the expansion being performed directly in the langevin equation . as a consequence ,",
    "our method does not require getting first a solution and , _ a priori _ , can be pushed to any order , the only limitation being the mathematical complexity of the obtained expressions .",
    "this represents a crucial advantage over the other approaches which allows us to treat analytically the case of an arbitrary potential with backreaction .",
    "it should be noticed that the idea to solve perturbatively the langevin equation was put forward for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that reference ,",
    "the method was used to compute the three - point correlation function of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy while , here , we use it in order to study the influence of the quantum effects on the behavior of the background inflaton . in particular",
    ", we show that , at second order , the calculation of the probability density function reduces to the calculation of a single quadrature",
    ". moreover , the case where the volume effects are taken into account only requires the calculation of an additional integral .",
    "the method is then applied to various concrete cases , as the chaotic , new , hybrid and running mass inflationary models . in each case , the probability density function can be computed analytically and the volume effects evaluated exactly .",
    "this allows us to study the relevance of the quantum effects in those models .",
    "in particular , in the case of the running mass model , this is the first time that such an investigation is carried out .    our paper is organized as follows .",
    "in the next section ( sec .",
    "[ basic equations ] ) , we briefly review the basic equations of stochastic inflation . then , in sec .  [ solving stochastic inflation ] ,",
    "we present our method and compare it with the approaches known in the existing literature .",
    "we also show how to compute the probability density function , with or without the volume effects taken into account , directly from the langevin equation without writing a fokker - planck equation .",
    "as already mentioned , we explicitly demonstrate that this calculation simply reduces to the calculation of a single quadrature . in sec .",
    "[ inflationary models ] , we briefly present the inflationary models the stochastic effects of which are computed in the subsequent section . in particular , we focus on the choice of the free parameters characterizing the corresponding potentials since their values are crucial in order to estimate the importance of the quantum effects . in sec .",
    "[ results and discussion ] , we discuss and interpret our results for the cases of large field models , small field models , hybrid inflation and running mass inflation . to our knowledge ,",
    "the calculation of the mean value and the variance of the coarse - grained field in the last three models was never done before ( when the backreaction is taken into account ) .",
    "we end this article by some concluding remarks .",
    "in the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe , the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy allow us to write the metric in the simple form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the time - dependent scale factor and where we have assumed flat space - like sections .",
    "in such a space - time the evolution of an homogeneous scalar field @xmath2 , sourcing the metric evolution , is described by the klein - gordon equation @xmath3 where a dot means a derivation with respect to the cosmic time @xmath4 and a prime a derivation with respect to the scalar field @xmath5 .",
    "this equation is coupled to the friedmann equation for the scale factor @xmath6\\ , , \\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the planck mass .    during a phase of inflation ,",
    "if the slow roll approximation is satisfied then the acceleration @xmath9 of the field is negligible compared to the friction term @xmath10 and , at the same time , the kinetic energy @xmath11 is small compared to the potential energy @xmath12 .",
    "this approximation considerably simplifies the equations describing the evolution of the system .",
    "these ones can now be re - written as @xmath13 at the classical level , there is nothing more to say .",
    "once we are given a potential @xmath12 , the above equations can be solved and the time evolution of the scale factor and of the inflaton field obtained .",
    "the problem becomes much more complicated when the field @xmath5 is considered as a quantum operator .",
    "a first difficulty arises because quantizing a scalar in curved space - time is technically complicated for the case of an arbitrary potential ( for an arbitrary potential , the klein - gordon equation is non - linear and one can not fourier expand the field and write an equation for a time - dependent mode function ) .",
    "a second ( more fundamental ) difficulty is to take into account the effect of the quantum scalar field on the geometry , _ i.e.  _ the backreaction problem .",
    "since the inflaton sources the einstein equations , the friedmann equation ( taken literally ) indicates that the geometry should also be quantized .",
    "unfortunately , this quantum gravity regime is presently not known and the previous program can not be carried out .",
    "the stochastic formalism allows us to circumvent these difficulties . in the stochastic formalism",
    "@xcite , one is interested in the dynamics of a `` coarse - grained '' field @xmath14 .",
    "this coarse - grained field is defined to be the spatial average of the ordinary field @xmath15 over a physical volume the size of which is typically larger than the hubble radius @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , @xmath17 basically contains the long - wavelength fourier modes ( _ i.e .  _ those with comoving wavenumber such that @xmath18 ) only .",
    "the evolution of the coarse - grained field is still described by the klein - gordon equation   but a suitable random noise field @xmath19 , acting as a classical stochastic source term , should be added in order to take into account the effect of the quantum fluctuations . in the slow - roll approximation ,",
    "the evolution of the coarse - grained field is thus governed by a first order langevin - like differential equation which can be written as  @xcite @xmath20 where the noise field @xmath21 is defined in such a way that its mean and two - point correlation function simply read @xmath22 @xmath23 being the dirac distribution .",
    "the normalization of the correlation function is chosen in order to reproduce the ordinary result , @xmath24 , valid for a free field in de sitter space - time .",
    "it is at this point that the backreaction problem shows up .",
    "the standard assumption is that the hubble parameter in eq .",
    "( [ langevin ] ) is only controlled by the coarse - grained field .",
    "then , one needs to specify how @xmath25 depends on @xmath26 and one naturally assumes that the friedmann equation ( in the slow - roll approximation ) holds for the coarse grained quantities , namely @xmath27 a direct consequence of the above equation is that the noise becomes multiplicative .",
    "the formalism briefly described previously also indicates that the coarse - grained field @xmath26 now describes a brownian motion for which the classical drift is modified by the quantum diffusion term .",
    "the main goal is to solve eq .",
    "( [ langevin ] ) since , endowed with the solution , we can then evaluate the probability density function of the coarse - grained field and/or various correlation functions .",
    "as discussed above , the main purpose of this article is to present and study a method for solving the langevin equation .",
    "this method was used for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite for the calculation of cmb non - gaussianities and in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to compute how the quantum effects affect the behavior of the quintessence field during inflation . here",
    ", we develop the method in full generality including the calculation of the probability density function .",
    "the main idea is to consider the coarse - grained field @xmath26 as a perturbation of the classical solution @xmath28 ( the classical solution is defined as the solution of the langevin equation without the noise ) , @xmath29 being supposed to be known .",
    "the corrections to @xmath30 are obtained by adding successive terms of higher and higher powers in the noise , _",
    "i.e.  _ @xmath31 where the term @xmath32 depends on the noise at the power @xmath33 .",
    "the equations of motion controlling the evolution of the term @xmath32 are obtained by inserting the above expansion into the langevin equation and by identifying the terms of same order .",
    "expanding up to second order , we get two linear differential equations for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , namely @xmath36 and @xmath37 these equations are similar to eq .  ( 17 ) of ref .  @xcite .",
    "the only difference is that , in the previous reference , the langevin equation is written in term of the number of e - folds while , here , our time variable is the cosmic time .",
    "since the above equations are linear , they can be solved by varying the integration constant .",
    "straightforward manipulations lead to @xmath38}{2\\pi}\\int_{{t_\\mathrm{in}}}^t\\!\\!{\\mathrm{d}}\\tau    \\frac{h^{3/2}\\left[\\varphi _ { \\rm cl}(\\tau ) \\right]}{h'\\left[\\varphi    _ { \\rm cl}(\\tau ) \\right]}\\xi(\\tau)\\ , , \\ ] ] where we have assumed that the initial conditions are such that @xmath39 . in the same manner ,",
    "the solution for @xmath40 can be easily obtained and reads @xmath41 as expected , @xmath34 is linear in the noise @xmath21 while @xmath35 is quadratic . of course",
    ", the expansion could be pushed further and one could evaluate @xmath42 , @xmath43 etc  using the same technique .",
    "we are now in a position where the various correlation functions can be calculated exactly .",
    "since @xmath34 is linear in the noise , its mean value obviously vanishes @xmath44 this means that @xmath34 does not introduce any correction to the mean value of the coarse - grained field . as a matter of fact",
    ", @xmath34 directly contributes only to the variance of @xmath45 .",
    "using the white noise correlation function given by eq .",
    "( [ noisecorr ] ) , we obtain @xmath46 we see that the calculation of the variance reduces to a simple quadrature . in order to calculate the correction to the mean value we must consider the mean of @xmath35 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath47 , we arrive at @xmath48\\bigg\\}\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this expression , the first term is nothing but the one given in , _",
    "i.e.  _ @xmath49 , while the second one can be evaluated exactly with the help of an integration by parts .",
    "this leads to @xmath50\\ , .\\ ] ] therefore , at second order in the noise , everything can be reduced to the calculation of a single quadrature , the one of eq .",
    "( [ slowvar ] ) . before discussing the probability density function ,",
    "we compare the method described above with what is already known in the literature .",
    "as already mentioned before , in order to treat the case with backreaction , various papers  @xcite concentrate on very particular cases where the langevin equation can be solved exactly ( see also the recent article , ref .",
    "@xcite , where the same method is used ) .",
    "the typical example of this procedure is the model described by a quartic potential , @xmath51 , @xmath52 being a dimensionless coupling constant , for which the langevin equation can be written as @xmath53 this equation can be solved exactly because it takes the form of a bernoulli equation after a change of variable .",
    "however , in this case , one does not obtain the coarse - grained field itself but rather some power of it , namely @xmath54\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the classical solution ( which , in the slow - roll approximation , is known explicitly ) and where the stochastic quantity @xmath56 is defined by @xmath57 ^ 2\\xi(\\tau ) \\ , , \\ ] ] which is a new dimensionless gaussian noise with vanishing mean value and whose variance ( and higher correlation functions ) can easily be computed .",
    "therefore , if one wants to obtain the field itself , it is necessary to take the inverse square root of the solution  ( [ solphi ] ) .    at this point ,",
    "several remarks are in order .",
    "first , the only way to compute the coarse - grained field @xmath45 and its various correlation functions is to expand @xmath58 in @xmath59 , that is to say in the coupling constant @xmath60 , and to truncate the expansion at some order ( the series does not converge anyway ) .",
    "thus , we see that , despite the fact that we have an exact solution , an expansion is still required in order to use eq .",
    "( [ solphi ] ) concretely .",
    "second , one can show that the expansion in the coupling constant is equivalent to our expansion in the noise  @xcite .",
    "however , clearly , our method is more general because it is not restricted to the situation where an exact solution of the langevin equation is available .",
    "this is because the expansion is directly performed in the langevin equation rather than in its solution .",
    "the drawback of the method used in refs .",
    "@xcite is clearly that it is first necessary to find a solution of the langevin equation before the expansion can be taken .",
    "we will illustrate this last remark on the calculation of the criterion which determines when the self - reproducing regime becomes efficient ( _ i.e .",
    "_ when the quantum fluctuations dominate the classical drift ) . in ref",
    "@xcite , using the model @xmath61 for the reasons described before , the authors have recovered the standard result that this happens when the initial value of the inflaton is larger than @xmath62 . using our formalism , we will derive this criterion for any model of the form @xmath63 , which would not have been possible with the method of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another possibility studied in the literature is the so - called scaling solutions method , see ref .",
    "the idea is to perform a change of variable and to work in terms of a new stochastic process @xmath64 such that the langevin equation takes the form @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is _ a priori _ a complicated function of @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath67 is replaced by @xmath68 in @xmath66 , then the new langevin equation becomes solvable .",
    "therefore , one sees that this method bears some resemblance with the method investigated here .",
    "however , there also exists important differences .",
    "first , our method does not require any change of variable which is an advantage since , in general , the link between @xmath45 and @xmath67 is quite complicated .",
    "second , in the scaling method , there is no systematic expansion in the noise ( in some sense one always works at first order ) while in our method we can go to any order , the only limitation being mathematical complexity .",
    "third , a saddle point approximation is used to estimate the effective dispersion while , in our case , following the calculations of the previous subsection , this can be done exactly .",
    "fourth , it is difficult to evaluate the reliability of the scaling limit while we will discuss in a forthcoming article  @xcite how the accuracy of our method can be determined precisely .",
    "finally , let us also stress that , in ref .",
    "@xcite , only the cases of large field models and exponential potentials are considered ( in principle , it would be possible to treat other models with the scaling method although it is unclear whether this would lead to analytical expressions for the probability density ) while , here , we will also apply our method to the new , hybrid and running mass inflationary scenarios .",
    "finally , let us repeat that the method studied here is similar to the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite even if we apply it in a different context . in particular , the solution given by eqs .",
    "( [ slowfirst ] ) and ( [ slowsecond ] ) are identical to eqs .",
    "( 19 ) and  ( 21 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , these formulas , however , being written in terms of the total number of e - folds rather than in terms of cosmic time . in ref .",
    "@xcite , these results are applied to the calculation of the three - point correlation function of the cmb fluctuations while , in the present article , we use them , among others , in order to derive the probability density function of the background field .    to end this subsection ,",
    "let us recall that more details on the other methods discussed here can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .      after having compared our approach with other formalisms , we now come back to the general method and show how one can calculate the single point probability distribution @xmath69 of the coarse - grained field ( also sometimes called @xmath70 in the literature ) .",
    "let us recall that @xmath69 is the probability of the stochastic process to assume a given value at a given time in a single coarse - grained domain .",

    "therefore , in order to compute the volume effects , one should evaluate the original integral .",
    "unfortunately , an exact integration is not possible in this case .",

    "results for rm1 and rm2 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ rm1and2 ] .",
    "let us start with the rm1 model . in this case",
    ", @xmath361 follows very closely the classical solution , the peak of the distribution being slightly `` behind '' @xmath362 ( as for lf ) .",
    "interestingly enough , if , at the beginning of inflation , the distribution @xmath361 starts spreading around its mean value as it was the case for the lf and sf models then , after some e - foldings , the variance reaches a maximum and then starts decreasing , _ i.e.  _ @xmath361 becomes more and more peaked over the classical solution .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the classical dynamics ( which dominates at late times ) tends to attract different solutions contrarily to the sf case where they are instead pulled apart .",
    "the behavior of @xmath363 is even more interesting .",
    "the volume weighted distribution moves backwards , beyond the maximum of the potential , into the region classically corresponding to rm2 .",
    "then , it reverses its motion and comes back into the region corresponding to rm1 .",
    "this last behavior is probably not trustable because , as long as @xmath363 penetrates the region rm2 , the calculations performed before should be modified to take this situation into account .",
    "let us also notice that this behavior is not exactly similar to the one observed for the sf model where the distribution goes to the region @xmath328 , see the discussion above .",
    "indeed , in this last case , whatever the sign of the field , the model is the same , in particular the value of @xmath127 remains unchanged .",
    "on the contrary , rm1 and rm2 are really two different models with two different energy scales .",
    "let us now study rm2 . as for rm1 ,",
    "the peak of @xmath361 follows the classical solution with the difference , however , that it is slightly ahead @xmath362 ( as for sf ) and that the spreading of the distribution continuously increases . at the beginning of inflation",
    ", @xmath363 also follows @xmath362 but , then , it changes its motion and moves back towards the region corresponding to rm1 .",
    "one of our main conclusion concerning running mass inflation is that , if rm1 and rm2 are classically two different models , from a statistical point of view , it may then be impossible to distinguish between them .",
    "indeed , regardless of which model we decide to start with , if the initial conditions are sufficiently close to @xmath281 , then there is a significant probability of diffusing on the other side of the potential .",
    "moreover , when we start with rm1 ( rm2 ) , volume effects tends to push the evolution towards rm2 ( rm1 ) .",
    "therefore , as it was the case for sf , it seems reasonable to postulate that the system will settle down at the boundary between the two models , a situation described by a stationary distribution concentrated around @xmath141 .",
    "such a situation typically leads to the self - reproducing regime .",
    "finally , another important feature of the running mass potential is that quantum effects can strongly modify the classical evolution even if the energy scale involved is far below the planck energy ( this is also the case for new inflation ) .",
    "this reinforces the fact that the connection between the importance of the quantum effects on one hand and the fact that @xmath137 is close to the planck energy on the other hand is very specific to the large field monomial potentials used in chaotic inflation .",
    "in fact , it is clear that quantum fluctuations are important whenever the classical contribution to the motion of the field is suppressed .",
    "in chaotic inflation , this happens close the planck scale because of the large friction term but this also happens near the maximum of the potential ( and far from the planck scale ) in new and running mass inflation models because of the smallness of @xmath364 .",
    "we end this section by a slightly different discussion . in ref .",
    "@xcite , eternal inflation is studied using the langevin equation for the model @xmath365 . the main argument presented for considering",
    "this simple model is that analytical progress may be made in this case . using the method presented in our article",
    ", one can in fact consider a much larger variety of models and one is not restricted to the simple chaotic quartic model . in order to illustrate this claim we consider the calculation , presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , of the value of the inflaton at which the self - reproducing behavior becomes possible , not only for the potential @xmath366 but for the general case @xmath367 ( in fact , one could even reproduce this calculation for new inflation , running mass inflation and so on ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the main idea is to evaluate the mean value of the number of e - folds is given by @xmath368 this expression can easily be evaluated for any potential using our perturbative treatment . for large fields models ,",
    "straightforward calculations lead to @xmath369\\ , .\\ ] ] the breakdown of this expansion signals the beginning of the self - reproducing regime . using the fact that @xmath370",
    ", one easily sees that this happens when the initial value of the field is @xmath371 where the coupling constant @xmath372 is defined such that @xmath373 . for @xmath133 one recovers the condition found in ref .",
    "our method allows us to obtain this condition for any potential and there is no need to assume a quartic potential to perform this calculation explicitly .",
    "incidentally , the above condition was also found previously for instance in ref .",

    "we now quickly summarize what are the new results obtained in this article .",
    "first , we have presented a perturbative method , used for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite , for solving the langevin equation of stochastic inflation with , and this is crucial for the present article , the backreaction taken into account .",
    "we have compared this formalism with the other methods already known in the literature and have argued that it is more powerful because the approximation is made directly in the langevin equation rather than in its solution .",
    "in particular , we were able to provide a general second order expression for the probability distribution of the field with or without the volume effects taken into account .",
    "our expression only requires the calculation of one quadrature ( two if the volume effects are considered ) which , for most of the inflationary scenarios , can be performed explicitly .",
    "second , we have applied this method to various models of inflation .",
    "this has allowed us to compute the quantum effects with backreaction for chaotic , new , hybrid and running mass inflation . to our knowledge , in the case of the last three models ,",
    "this is the first time that such a calculation is done ( the backreaction being taken into account ) .",
    "third , we have discussed the impact of the stochastic effects on these inflationary scenarios .",
    "for instance , in the case of running mass inflation , it was shown that the quantum effects blur the distinction between the various running mass inflationary models and that the self - reproducing regime is likely to be important .",
    "finally , an important advantage of the method presented here is that its accuracy and domain of validity can be evaluated in details",
