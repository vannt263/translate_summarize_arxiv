    "the derivation shows , that in case of resonance one may give semianalitical estimates on chaotic behavior .",
    "the study on manifolds for multi - dimensional billiards related to geometric properties is presented in @xcite .    from the practical point of view the reaction of @xmath2 with @xmath3 on @xmath4 surface , which is under thermal excitation , the molecules @xmath2 performs diffusive motion on the surface before the reaction would occur @xcite .",
    "quasi - deterministic aspects on diffusion may occur in the behaviour of of certain species where in the process of food searching one can find a randomness , but there is also a kind of determinism because the animals may have certain remembrances on the places where they found food in the past @xcite .",
    "the article is organised as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : bbb ] we shortly describe the bouncing ball billiard system . the section [ sec : gencons ] makes a presentation of that frequency region where the semianalical approaches to some extent are possible .",
    "section [ sec : geom ] shows an evaluation which has a semi - empirical and analytical background giving a lower bound for the maximal ljapunov exponent .",
    "finally , section [ sec : thereal ] discusses the similarities and differences of the analytical and real value of the maximal ljapunov exponent .",
    "at this point we make a review of the most important features of the bouncing ball problem .",
    "the system studied is a point particle , which bounces on a floor realised of arc of circles @xcite .",
    "the floor is oscillating with a frequency @xmath5 corresponding to a circular frequency @xmath6 .",
    "the system is presented below .",
    "the bouncing ball billiard from the point of view of the diffusion was presented in a comprehensive way in @xcite .",
    "the main conclusions are that the system possesses irregular diffusion , and the principal maximas for the diffusion occurs at the resonances",
    ". these resonances are at the frequencies , where the time of the flight becomes equal or multiple of the period of vibration applied .",
    "the bouncing ball billiard that we study in this paper , with the floor formed by circular scatterers , is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : coordinates ] .",
    "the equations of motion of this system are presented as follows : the particle performs a free flight between two collisions in the gravitational field @xmath7 .",
    "consequently , its coordinates @xmath8 and velocities @xmath9 at time @xmath10 immediately before the @xmath11 collision and its coordinates @xmath12 and velocities @xmath13 at time @xmath14 immediately after the @xmath15 collision are related by the following equations @xmath16 at the collisions the change of the velocities is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the velocity of the corrugated floor .",
    "we distinguish between the two different velocity components relative to the normal vector at the surface of the scatterers , where the scatterers are represented by the arcs of the circles forming the floor .",
    "@xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the normal and tangential components of the particle s , respectively the floor s velocity with respect to the surface at the scattering point .",
    "correspondingly , we introduce two different restitution coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 that are perpendicular , respectively tangential to the normal .    as in case of the vertically bouncing ball problem we assume that the floor oscillates sinusoidally , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the amplitude respectively the frequency of the vibration , see fig.[fig : coordinates ] .",
    "the radius of circles are @xmath28=15 mm and the restitution coefficients @xmath29 , respective @xmath30 .",
    "it is important that the slope on the arcs of the circles is very shallow .",
    "the distance between two arc of circles is @xmath31 . by this terms",
    "proportional with @xmath32 or less are considered terms with second - or higher - order .",
    "the chaos of the bouncing ball which spatially is a one dimensional system and which is performed on the vertical direction has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "if we consider @xmath33 the initial displacement and @xmath34 the displacement after @xmath35 bounces between neighboring trajectories for the one dimensional vertically bouncing ball , then the ljapunov exponent may be evaluated : @xmath36 .",
    "the main problem is that at certain frequencies the ball may be stucked on the surface .",
    "because the neigbouring trajectory usually is also stucked , i.e. @xmath34 becomes zero , consequently in such cases the ljapunov exponent @xmath37 is simply undefined .    of coarse one",
    "may discuss on chaotic regimes between two stucks , but this is the reason why in general considerations about the chaoticity of the vertically bouncing ball should be done in a very careful way .    in spite of the fact that in two dimensions it is almost impossible to have neighboring orbits stucked at the same place , the following study will try to avoid that frequency regions where stucking orbits might be possible .",
    "we discuss the chaoticity of the bouncing ball billiard at the frequency region where the 1/1 resonance holds .",
    "the approximation we try to make is semi - empirical and the considerations are presented below .",
    "the first observation we make is , that the time of the flight between subsequent collision at 1/1 resonance is approximately the same .",
    "we note this time with @xmath38 and corresponds to that time while the particle makes one bounce and it is close to the time while the floor makes one complete oscillation .",
    "subsequent values of @xmath38 at 1/1 resonance are shown below    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     one can see that these values do not differ too much",
    ". they can not be the same , for instance because the surface is not flat , but they are close to each other and around a specific value .",
    "the other observation is , that the first resonance manifests so that the elongation almost reaches its maximum @xmath26 , and the particle meets the floor for almost all cases very close to this height @xmath26 - see fig . [ fig : trajectory ] .",
    "we consider one component of the velocity , namely the horizontal one @xmath39 .",
    "we are interested in change in difference of the horizontal component of the velocities of two neighboring trajectories . by this",
    "we try to make an estimate of a lower bound of the ljapunov exponent , which manifests on the @xmath39 direction of the phase space , which would also give a picture on the _ horizontal chaoticity _ of this problem .    the figure below fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectory ] shows two trajectories , starting from the same place , with slightly different velocity vectors .",
    "the picture is at 1/1 resonance , where after a certain transient the bounces are made a little bit above the vertical coordinate @xmath40 mm which denotes the amplitude .",
    "we assume that at the starting point there is a difference in angles but not in the magnitude of the velocities @xmath41 .",
    "this initial deflection in angles we denote by @xmath42 . the corresponding difference in initial velocities we denote by @xmath43 . because of this initial deflection in angle",
    "there will be at final arrival a change in horizontal coordinates @xmath44 .    due to the convex curvature of the arcs characterized by the radius @xmath28",
    ", the displacement @xmath44 at the arrival on this curvature will cause further deflection in angles after one collision which we denote by @xmath45 .",
    "this cause a final difference in the horizontal component of velocities after the first bounce @xmath46 .",
    "the rate of exponential separation of the trajectories after such a bounce due to the finite radius @xmath28 we denote with @xmath47 @xmath48    at the launch of the trajectory we consider the magnitude of the velocity @xmath41 , the angles relative to the vertical are @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the complementer angles are @xmath51 and @xmath52 where as it was mentioned above @xmath53 @xmath54 where the higher order terms means terms which are proportional with at least the second power of @xmath42 . correspondingly if @xmath45 is the angle between the directions of trajectories after the first bounce @xmath55 because there is a free flight in gravitational field and the arcs are with shallow slope practically @xmath56 , very precisely their difference is a second order term .",
    "we mention , that @xmath49 is also small as one can see on the fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectory ] , so its product with @xmath42 is also considered a value with second order . or @xmath57 would be kept , at the end where the average value is calculated for @xmath58 or it drops out or it is proved to be of higher order . ]    as a result we get for the value @xmath47 , which has a definite contribution due to the finite value of @xmath59 where one can see that the ratio between the deflection of the angles after the bounce and before the bounce counts .    the bounce is presented on fig .",
    "[ fig : arrival ] .    based on fig .",
    "[ fig : arrival ] we can conclude that the deflection between the two reflected trajectories ( @xmath45 ) one hand is due to the initial deflection @xmath42 . for the reflected trajectories",
    "there is a contribution due to the curvature .",
    "if the point of incidence of the first trajectory is at @xmath60 then the point of incidence of the second one is at @xmath61 .",
    "the incident angles relative to the normal differs by @xmath62 and in addition the reflected angles - on the fig .",
    "[ fig : arrival ] - @xmath63 and @xmath64 has also a difference @xmath62 .",
    "consequently the term @xmath62 has to be counted twice .",
    "@xmath65 inserting this relation in eq.([eq : lambda3 ] ) one gets @xmath66    at the arriving point on the surface the initial difference @xmath42 will cause a displacement @xmath44 .",
    "this means that on the arc of the circle the trajectories will arrive at a difference @xmath67 as one can see on fig .",
    "[ fig : arrival ] . now follows the evaluation of @xmath44 and correspondingly of the @xmath62 .",
    "the length @xmath44 is due to the difference in angles of the velocities , at the starting point .",
    "the first one is launched at an angle @xmath51 the other one with an angle @xmath68 . at the end one of the particles",
    "arrives at @xmath69 , the other one at @xmath70 @xmath71\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the angle of the velocity made with the horizontal direction of the first trajectory at the starting point . during the evaluation",
    "we make the approximation , that @xmath72 is approximately @xmath42 and @xmath73 or the differences are at least second order in @xmath42 , and are included in the higher order terms .",
    "@xmath74 + h.o.t.\\ ] ] at this point one can see that @xmath75 - here @xmath49 being the incident angle relative to the vertical - can be neglected , consequently @xmath62 yields the following value @xmath76 if we take into account that the time for the flight is @xmath77 then @xmath78 by this we get for the value @xmath47 in leading order @xmath79 where the logarithm has been expanded , and terms proportional with @xmath80 have been also considered as being of higher order .",
    "the average of @xmath47 means averaging the expression above . by this",
    "the higher order terms vanishes or becomes smaller so they remain of higher order .",
    "consequently it reduces to the average of the time of the flight @xmath38 .",
    "its average is given by the period of oscillations @xmath81 resulting for @xmath82 in leading order @xmath83 because @xmath82 is a manifestation of the separation of the neighboring trajectories in the @xmath39 direction due to the geometry , consequently this value can be considered a lower bound for the maximal ljapunov exponent .",
    "as it is pointed out in the work @xcite - with increasing the frequency - bifurcation of the resonant trajectory may be possible .",
    "this means that the time of flight consists of a shorter and a longer time alternating one after the other which we denote by @xmath84 and @xmath85 , but they still do not differ too much from each other . and",
    "@xmath85 even it is not possible , or because the dynamics enters in further bifurcations , or simply it crashes to a scenario with lots of sticking orbits . ]    in such case the approximation that have been presented previously are still valid and one gets after two consequent flights - one is shorter , one is longer - @xmath86 the argument of the logarithm can be written as @xmath87 + h.o.t.\\ ] ] after the expansion to the first order we have @xmath88 in the numerator of the second fraction the decompositions are made @xmath89 finally we arrive to the relation @xmath90 this expression can be averaged and the term proportional with @xmath91 is still too small and is considered of second order .",
    "the average of the last expression yields the value @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 represents the average values of the @xmath84 respective @xmath85 . because even in the case of the two periodic orbit @xmath95 equals an average time flight @xmath96 which is the inverse of that frequency @xmath5 where the dynamics is already bifurcated .",
    "this is in fact an interval of frequencies , so the latter formula for two periodic orbits still shows a strong analogy with eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambdavx ] ) and it may be written @xmath97 this latter formula shows that the relation ( [ eq : lambdavx ] ) may be valid for the full 1/1 resonance and for bifurcated trajectories not too far from it .",
    "in this section we discusses connections of the geometry with the chaoticity .",
    "the relation ( [ eq : lambdavx ] ) _ in case of the 1/1 resonance _ at a given gravitational field @xmath98 has a characteristic time of flight @xmath81 . because of this reason",
    ", one may consider that one of the most relevant dependence of the maximal ljapunov exponent from practical purposes is in terms of the radius .",
    "so in this section we restrict ourselves to the case of the frequency @xmath99 hz when the first resonance is fully developed . )",
    "is a frequency region @xmath100 hz .",
    "the validity sometimes may be even wider , however there is a slight dependence of the endpoints of the interval on @xmath28 , consequently it has been chosen a common domain in which the resonance or eventually the bifurcated scenario holds for different radii we discuss below . ]",
    "the following figure illustrates the numerical values of the maximal ljapunov exponent in terms of inverse of the radius .",
    "consequently we start at a curvature 1/24 mm@xmath101 and we end at a curvature 1/16 mm@xmath101 .",
    "the endpoints are also motivated by the works @xcite .    as one can see the maximal ljapunov exponent increases as the curvature - the inverse of the radius - increases .",
    "this is normal because a smaller radius implies a stronger separation of neighboring trajectories . from quantitative point of view",
    "both the numerical and the analytical evaluations has similar behavior - as it is shown on the fig .  [",
    "fig : ljapexp ] .",
    "regarding the quantitative aspects the evaluation ( [ eq : lambdavx ] ) is considerably below of the real value . partly because the analytical evaluation is just a projection . on the other hand",
    "the evaluation wants to detect only the geometrical effects on the chaoticity .",
    "of coarse considerable other effects may have an important role on the chaoticity , but the study of such aspects will need further work .",
