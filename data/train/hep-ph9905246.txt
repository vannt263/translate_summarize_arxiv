    "the notion of sterile neutrinos was introduced by b. pontecorvo in 1967 @xcite . in the last years the possibility of transitions of flavor neutrinos into noninteracting sterile states has been widely discussed in the literature .",
    "this interest in sterile neutrinos is connected mainly with the result of the lsnd experiment @xcite that together with the results of atmospheric @xcite and solar @xcite neutrino experiments imply the existence of sterile neutrinos @xcite .",
    "let us start with the discussion of the possibilities of sterile neutrinos to appear in neutrino mixing schemes ( see , for example , refs .",
    "flavor neutrinos @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , are determined by the standard charged - current ( cc ) and neutral - current ( nc ) weak interactions @xmath3 that conserve the electron @xmath4 , muon @xmath5 and tau @xmath6 lepton numbers , @xmath7    if there is neutrino mixing , the conservation laws ( [ lepton numbers ] ) are violated .",
    "neutrino mass term _ that does not conserve lepton numbers has the general form @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are @xmath11-component columns and @xmath12 is a @xmath13 matrix .",
    "there are two different possibilities for @xmath9 :    1 .",
    "only flavor fields @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) enter into @xmath9 : @xmath16 in this case @xmath12 is a @xmath17 matrix and for the mixing we have @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a unitary matrix and @xmath20 is the field of neutrinos with mass @xmath21 . the nature of neutrinos @xmath20 with definite mass depends on @xmath22 : 1 .   if @xmath23 where @xmath24 ( @xmath15 ) are right - handed neutrino fields , the total lepton number @xmath25 is conserved and the neutrinos @xmath20 with definite mass are _",
    "dirac particles_. the corresponding mass term is called `` dirac mass term '' .",
    "if @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the charge - conjugated ( right - handed ) component of the left - handed field @xmath28 ( @xmath15 and @xmath29 is the matrix of charge conjugation ) , there are no conserved lepton numbers and neutrinos with definite masses are _ majorana particles _ ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the corresponding mass term is called `` majorana mass term '' .",
    "+ from eq .",
    "( [ 3mixing ] ) it follows that in both cases only transitions between active neutrinos @xmath31 are possible .",

    "it is possible that there are three sterile fields @xmath32 that are the charge - conjugated components of right - handed neutrino fields , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "however , the sterile fields could also be fields of some other particles ( susy ,  ) .",

    "+ if all the masses @xmath21 of the fields @xmath20 in eq.([mixing ] ) are small , not only transitions between flavor neutrinos @xmath31 but also transitions between flavor and sterile neutrinos @xmath41 are possible .",
    "there are two possible ways to reveal the existence of sterile neutrinos :    1 .   through the determination of the number of massive neutrinos .",
    "if this number is larger than the number of flavor neutrinos ( three ) sterile neutrinos must exist .",
    "2 .   through the measurement of the total transition probability of neutrino with definite flavor ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) into all possible flavor neutrinos , @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "this probability can be determined from the investigation of nc induced neutrino processes . if @xmath44 from the unitarity of the mixing matrix it follows that active flavor neutrinos transform into sterile states .",

    "the existing data indicate that sterile neutrinos exist .    in the framework of the minimal scheme with four massive neutrinos , from the existing data it follows @xcite that the dominant transitions of solar neutrinos are @xmath50 .",
    "below we will present the corresponding arguments .",
    "figure [ 4spectra ] shows the six types of spectra of four massive neutrinos that can accommodate the solar , atmospheric and lsnd ranges of neutrino mass - squared differences .",
    "these spectra are divided in two classes : class 1 constituted by the spectra ( i)(iv ) and class 2 comprising the spectra ( a ) and ( b ) . in the spectra of class 1 a group of three close masses",
    "is separated from the fourth mass by the lsnd gap of @xmath51 . in the spectra of class",
