    "after decades of little change in the number of known stellar systems within 5 pc , numerous previously unknown low mass stars have recently been discovered in the solar neightborhood ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because they are extremely nearby and intrinsically low luminosity , these objects are ideal targets to search for low mass companions , since even a close companion will appear reasonably separated on the sky .",
    "for example during commissioning of the simultaneous differential imager ( sdi ) at the vlt @xcite , one such object , @xmath6 indi b was resolved into a binary t dwarf @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 indi ba , bb are the closest brown dwarfs to the earth ( 3.626@xmath00.009 pc ) . at a distance of 3.85@xmath00.02 pc @xcite , the recently discovered m8.5 star scr 1845 - 6357 is just slightly further away than @xmath6 indi ba , bb @xcite and is the 24th closest stellar system from the earth .",
    "we report the discovery of scr 1845 - 6357b ( hereafter scr1845b ) , a methane rich substellar companion to this star .",
    "this companion object is the third closest brown dwarf to the sun .",
    "it is also the only example of a t dwarf companion to a low mass star and one of the tightest known brown dwarf companions to a star .",
    "data were taken on the night of 2005 may 28 ( ut ) at the 8.2 m vlt - ut4 with the unique simultaneous differential imager ( sdi ) in the facility ao system naco @xcite .",
    "to guide on this faint red object , the infrared wavefront sensor ( irwfs ) was used with the `` k '' dichroic , sending all of the k band light to the wfs .",
    "sdi can be used to calibrate and remove the `` speckle noise '' in ao images , while also isolating the light from a substellar methane companion from the starlight .",
    "this method was pioneered by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "it exploits the fact that all cool ( t@xmath3 @xmath41200 k ) substellar objects have strong ch@xmath7 ( methane ) absorption redwards of 1.62 @xmath1 m in the h band infrared atmospheric window @xcite .",
    "the naco sdi device obtains four images of a star simultaneously through three slightly different narrowband filters ( sampling  both  inside  and  outside  of  the  ch@xmath7  features    * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these images are then differenced .",
    "this subtracts out the halo and speckles from the bright star to reveal any substellar methane objects orbiting that star .",
    "since a substellar methane object will be brightest in one filter and absorbed in the rest , while the star is bright in all three , a difference can be chosen which subtracts out the star s light and reveals the companion s light .",
    "thus , sdi also helps eliminate the large contrast difference between the star and substellar companions @xcite .",
    "the sdi device has already produced a number of important scientific results : the discovery of ab dor c @xcite  the faintest companion ever discovered within 0.16  of a star , detailed surface maps of titan @xcite , the discovery of the binarity of @xmath6 indi ba - bb , the nearest binary brown dwarf @xcite , and evidence of orbital motion for gl 86b , the first known white dwarf companion to an exoplanet host star @xcite .",
    "using the sdi device provides a marked advantage over single band imaging even in situations where the contrast difference between star and companion is not large  images in the 3 different sdi filters immediately provide spectral information about any substellar candidate , particularly regarding the amount of ch@xmath7 present .",
    "scr 1845 was observed for 15 minutes ( with 3@xmath830 s subimages taken at 5 different dither positions ) at a position angle of 0@xmath9 and 15 minutes at a position angle of 22@xmath9 . a base integration time ( dit ) of 30 s",
    "was used and subimages were medianed . observing the object at different roll angles allows us to immediately confirm if an object is real  an instrumental feature should not rotate with a change of rotator angle ; however , a real object on the sky should appear to rotate by the change in rotator angle .",
    "data were sky - subtracted , flat - fielded , and bad - pixel masked .",
    "each data frame was then aligned to a master frame using the iraf task xreg .",
    "after alignment , all frames were median combined . as a comparison , the data were also reduced using a custom idl sdi pipeline which performs basic data reduction tasks and also precisely aligns images taken in each of the filters using a custom shift and subtract routine @xcite .",
    "reduced data for the 0@xmath9 dataset are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : reduction0 ] .",
    "scr 1845b appears at a separation of 1.170@xmath00.003  and at a position angle of 170.20@xmath100.13@xmath9 from the m8.5 primary in all four of the sdi filters and rotates by 22@xmath9 ( as expected ) between datasets . a three color image generated from the sdi filter images",

    "[ fig:3colorsdi ] . for comparison , an image reduced using the sdi pipeline @xcite is also presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:3colorsdi ] .",
    "while scr 1845b is far from the primary and easily detected , we would also be capable of detecting similar or lower mass companions closer to the primary for this system ( down to 0.1  separations ) .",

    "@xcite provide an updated distance of 3.85@xmath00.02 pc .",
    "thus , the candidate substellar object lies 4.50@xmath00.02 au from its primary .",
    "the candidate object is 3.57@xmath00.057 mag fainter than the primary in the f1(1.575 @xmath1 m ) filter ( all photometry performed with the iraf daophot psf fitting package ) .",
    "the candidate object appears brightest in the f1(1.575 @xmath1 m ) filter , slightly fainter in the f2(1.6 @xmath1 m ) , and then drops by a factor of 2.7@xmath00.1 between the f1(1.575 @xmath1 m ) and f3(1.625 @xmath1 m ) filters .",
    "the spectral signature of this dropoff is consistent with methane absorption in the atmosphere of a substellar object @xcite .",
    "previous observations of the t6 spectral type brown dwarf @xmath6 indi bb @xcite with the sdi device found that the flux of @xmath6 indi bb also dropped by a similar factor between the f1(1.575 @xmath1 m ) and f3(1.625 @xmath1 m ) filters ( see fig .",

    "the sdi device measures the location and strength of the 1.6 @xmath1 m methane absorption break , which is a principle spectral feature used to determine spectral types for t dwarfs  this sdi methane index should be sufficient to estimate an accurate spectral type for this object . the sdi methane spectral index is defined as : index(@xmath11 ) = @xmath12    each sdi filter was manufactured by barr associates to have a precise bandwidth of 0.025 @xmath1 m , so the wavelength intervals in the numerator and denominator have the same length for the sdi methane index .",
    "we only possess sdi data on a limited number of t dwarfs ( this object , gl 229b , @xmath6 indi ba ( t1 ) , @xmath6 indi bb ( t6 ) ) . in order to compare scr 1845b to a wider range of l and t dwarf objects",
    "we calculated these same sdi spectral indices from spectra of 56 l dwarfs and 35 t dwarfs @xcite .",
    "spectra for these objects were obtained from sandy leggett s l and t dwarf archive . in order to make an accurate comparision",
    ", sdi filter transmission curves were convolved into these calculations .",
    "since we have full spectral data for these objects , we also calculated the 1.6 @xmath1 m methane spectral index defined by @xcite , which were found to be similar to our sdi methane spectral indices . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxes ] , sdi methane spectral indices are plotted for scr 1845b , the t dwarfs gl 229b , @xmath6 indi ba , @xmath6 indi bb , and 94 other l and t dwarfs .",
    "scr 1845b appears to have a noticeable methane break with somewhat lower indices than the t6 dwarfs gl 229b and @xmath6 indi bb .",
    "however , @xcite note that gl 229b has an anomalously high methane index for its spectral type and assign a large uncertainty to gl 229b s spectral type  t6@xmath01 . for our sdi methane indices ,",
    "scr 1845b has spectral indices similar to that of t4.5-t6.5 dwarfs .",
    "thus , we determine an initial spectral type of t5.5@xmath01 for scr 1845b .",
    "to determine an accurate h magnitude , the spectra of both the primary and secondary components of scr 1845 must be taken into account .",
    "the m8.5 primary is extremely red  and will appear brighter in the h band than in our blue f1 band .",
    "additionally , the t5.5@xmath01 companion is blue compared to the primary and will appear brighter in the f1 band than in the h band . to convert from our f1 filter magnitudes into calibrated h band magnitudes",
    "we must calculate the h band magnitude offsets for the m8.5 primary star and the t4.5-t6.5 companion ( offset@xmath13 and offset@xmath14 respectively ) : @xmath15    using the spectrum of the star vb10 ( an m8 template , and thus a reasonable approximation of an m8.5 spectrum ) , an h transmission curve , and our f1 filter transmission curve , we calculate a magnitude offset of offset@xmath13=-0.12@xmath00.08 mag .",
    "assuming spectral types of t4.5-t6.5 , we can perform a similar calculation for the companion .",
    "offsets were calculated for 15 objects with spectral types of t4.5-t7 ( spectra  from   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then averaged together by spectral type to derive an average offset for each spectral type .",
    "for instance , for a t5 companion , offset@xmath16 = 0.5@xmath00.05 . for a t6 companion , offset@xmath17 = 0.6@xmath00.07 .",

    "uncertainties are provided for a companion spectral type of t5.5@xmath01 .",
    "background t4-t7 dwarfs possess absolute h magnitudes of @xmath1814.5 - 16.0 @xcite , so our calculated absolute h magnitude of 15.23@xmath2 for scr 1845b is quite reasonable .",
    "this object has not been observed at multiple epochs with the sdi device so we must consult other sources to determine if it is indeed truly bound , i.e. shares a common - proper motion with its primary .",
    "scr 1845 possesses a large proper motion of @xmath182.5/ year . a bound companion would possess a similar proper motion whereas a background object would appear to stay in the same spot on the sky . on 2000 january 1 , scr 1845a had an ra of 18@xmath1945@xmath2005.2  and dec of -63@xmath95747.355 ",
    "( j2000 , * ? ? ?",
    "taking proper motion into account , during the 2005 may 28 sdi observations , scr 1845a therefore had an ra of 18@xmath1945@xmath2007.21  and dec of -63@xmath95743.586  .",
    "scr 1845b ( 1.17  separation at a pa of 170.2@xmath9 ) had an ra of 18@xmath1945@xmath2007.33  and dec of -63@xmath95742.786  during the 2005 may 28 sdi observations . if the faint companion is actually a background t dwarf , this ra and dec should be reasonably correct for other epochs of observation . checking the 2mass point source catalog ( 2mass images taken 2000 may 29 )",
    ", we found no objects within 20  of this position and no objects with t dwarf colors in this part of the sky .",
    "hence , it is impossible that this object is a background t - dwarf and it is highly likely to be a bound companion .    in the last few years",
    ", 3 new t dwarf companions have been discovered within 6 pc of the sun scr 1845b and @xmath6 indi ba - bb .",
    "all three of the nearest t dwarfs are bound companions to stars .",
    "combining these three new t dwarf companions with gl 229b ( 5.8 pc ) and gl 570d ( 5.9 pc ) , we find a number density of t dwarf companions of 5.5@xmath810@xmath21 pc@xmath21 within 6 pc of the sun .",
    "in contrast , only two isolated , field t dwarfs ( 2mass  j0415  and  2mass  j0937  from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are known within 6 pc of the sun , leading to a rough number density of field t dwarfs of @xmath182@xmath810@xmath21pc@xmath21 in this volume .",
    "granted , this number of field dwarfs is somewhat incomplete since there may be nearby t dwarfs without accurate trigonometric parallaxes , but the number is unlikely to change by more than a factor of 2 since this population of bright t - dwarfs is very well studied .",
    "the existence of 5 brown dwarfs within binary systems @xmath4 6 pc of the sun suggests that the number density of t dwarfs in binary systems may be higher than that of isolated , single t dwarfs .",
    "this may be difficult to expain with `` ejection '' theories of brown dwarf formation @xcite .",
    "while the distance to scr 1845 is well known , the age of the system is unconstrained .",
    "ages between 100 myr and 10 gyr are all plausible for this system at this time .",
    "future observations of lithium absorption might constrain the age of this system or at least rule out very young ages . however , with a v@xmath22=41 km / s it is unlikely that this system is very young . using the @xcite cond models with this age range , an absolute h mag range of 15.1 to 15.6 , and spectral types of t4.5-t6.5 ( t@xmath3 @xmath18 850 k @xmath0 100 k )",
    ", we find a mass range of 9 - 65 m@xmath5 .",
    "while scr 1845b is clearly substellar at any age , the uncertainty in the age of this system means that we can not derive an unambiguous mass for this object from the cond models .",
    "however , since this object is so close to its primary ( currently @xmath184.5 au ) , orbital motion should be evident within a few years .",
    "both the primary and secondary mass can be measured accurately within a decade , making scr 1845b a key t - dwarf mass - luminosity calibrator .",
