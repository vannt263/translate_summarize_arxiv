    "it is believed that the center of essentially every large galaxy , including our own , contains a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "sagittarius a * , first discovered as a bright radio source , is expected to host the smbh at the center of the milky way .",
    "observations of the region in the infrared @xcite , radio @xcite , x - ray @xcite and optical @xcite , have revealed properties of the central object such as mass and accretion flow .",
    "alternates to an smbh , such as a dense cluster of dark stellar objects or a ball of massive , degenerate fermions @xcite have largely been ruled out .",
    "these observations also indicate an initial mass function ( imf ) near the smbh strongly tilted towards massive stars @xcite .",
    "this top - heavy imf suggests a large population of neutron stars orbiting the smbh with estimates placing @xmath010000 of them within 1 pc of sgr a * @xcite and 1000 within 0.01 pc @xcite .",
    "beams from these pulsars could traverse the strong field region of the smbh , be deflected and reach the earth .",
    "using the precision of pulsar timing , we might be able to detect these deflected beams and from them infer properties of the strong field region through which the beams have passed .",
    "previous work in this direction with the assumption of a nonspinning smbh has been reported in wang et al .",
    "@xcite and stovall et al .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter paper i , ii and iii respectively ) . in paper i , strong field effects on the intensity and time of arrivals ( toa ) of pulsar beams were analyzed in the case that the pulsar beam is confined to the plane of the pulsar orbit .",
    "paper ii extended the formalism to general orientations . in paper iii ,",
    "an estimate was given of the probability of observing these deflected pulsar beams .",
    "for the pulsar luminosity distribution calculated in the atnf pulsar catalog , it was found that there is a marginal probability of detection with current instruments , like the parkes and green bank telescope , and future instruments , in particular fast and ska , provide a reasonable chance of detection . for a more conservative distribution @xcite , chances of detection with existing telescopes are weak , and we must await more sensitive instruments like ska .",
    "paper iii was based on the the model of paper ii , and hence embodied the assumption of a nonspinning smbh .",
    "the sgr a * smbh is certainly expected to be rotating , though the rate of rotation is indeterminate , with predictions for the spin rate ranging from very slow @xcite to moderate @xcite . in principle , spin effects could have a dramatic effect on beam bending and hence on the probability of the detection of deflected beams .",
    "the chief motivation of the current paper is to analyze a pulsar - kerr smbh system to see if the detection probability estimates obtained for a nonrotating smbh are significantly different , and especially whether they might improve the prospects for near - term detection .",
    "a second purpose of this paper is to check whether the smbh spin would have a strong enough effect on pulsar timing that spin information could be extracted from the arrival times of the pulses in a deflected beam .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : review ] , we give an overview of the previous work and redefine terms that will be useful for purposes of generalization and comparison .",
    "we compare deflection of beams by a rotating smbh and that by a nonrotating smbh in section  [ sec : schvskerr ] .",

    ", we will use the natural units ( @xmath1 ) and describe distances and time in terms of the black hole mass @xmath2 .",
    "as observed in paper iii , for a pulsar revolving around a schwarzschild smbh , there is a ` region of detectability ' - a range of earth angular positions on the pulsar sky at which both direct and deflected beams are detectable .",
    "we start by reviewing the determination of this region .     and",
    "@xmath3 are illustrated for one of the trajectories .",
    "this figure also serves for photons emitted in the equatorial plane of a spinning black hole . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : bending ] sketches the trajectory of photons outside a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "also illustrated is the set of angles we use to describe a particular trajectory . here",
    "@xmath4 corresponds to the angle at which the photon is emitted relative to the radially outward direction at the point of emission in a spherical coordinate system centered at the smbh ; @xmath3 corresponds to the angle measured relative to the same radial direction far away from the strong field region of the smbh .",
    "paper i relates these two angles by a function @xmath5 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the pulsar - smbh distance at the time of emission . in the absence of deflection , @xmath3 will be equal to @xmath4 .",
    ", for a pulsar at @xmath8 from a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the shaded regions represent beams that are either weakly bent or too strongly attenuated . ]",
    "paper iii notes that the intensity of a deflected beam will be modified .",
    "there is a narrow range of @xmath3 around @xmath9 for which there is dramatic amplification corresponding to strong lensing , but in general strongly bent beams will be attenuated .",
    "figure  [ fig : attvsphiout ] shows the relationship of @xmath3 and attenuation . for @xmath10",
    "the bending is not significant ; a deflected beam will not be distinguishable from a direct beam . for @xmath11 ,",
    "beams that are very strongly deflected are too attenuated to be detectable .",
    "therefore , we have a @xmath12 , a cutoff for @xmath3 beyond which attenuation reduces beam intensity below telescope sensitivity .",
    "we define @xmath13 as the range of @xmath3 for which the deflection is significant , but the deflected beam is still detectable . if the earth is within this range , the strongly deflected beam will be detectable .",
    "the determination of the probability of detection of a deflected beam then involves two steps : calculating the probability of the pulsar beams being deflected to the region of detectibility , and calculating how often the earth will lie in this region .",
    "this was achieved in paper iii for nonrotating black holes and it was found that with current pulsar population models near the galactic center , there is a good chance of detection by a multi - year program with future telescopes . our primary aim in the current paper is to find whether these estimates are significantly changed by a consideration of the spin of the smbh in sgr a*. the first step will be to find a version of figure  [ fig : attvsphiout ] that applies to a spinning smbh .",

    "the nature of the spin effects on the @xmath5 function of equation   are clearest for photon trajectories in the equatorial plane .",
    "figure  [ fig : bending ] shows sketches of such trajectories in either the kerr geometry or the schwarzschild geometry ( for which any plane can be considered the equatorial plane ) .",
    "the deflection is minimum for photons emitted in the radially outward direction ( i.e. , for @xmath4 = 0 ) . as @xmath4 increases ,",
    "photons get closer and closer to the black hole and deflection increases , as is evident in figure  [ fig : bending ] .",
    "all photons straying too close , fall into the black hole .",
    "we thus identify an orbit around the black hole with the characteristic that the number of orbits of a photon traveling along this orbit grows without bound , so that @xmath3 effectively approaches infinity .",
    "we use the term _ unstable circular orbit _ ( uco ) to refer to this orbit and denote the emission angle of a photon traversing this critical trajectory as @xmath14 . for a schwarzschild black hole ,",
    "figure  [ fig : phioutvsphin ] plots the relationship between @xmath3 and @xmath4 up to @xmath15 . for larger values of @xmath4",
    "there is no @xmath3 defined since these trajectories end inside the black hole .",
    "for photons orbiting a schwarzschild hole , it is known that the uco lies at @xmath16 . for those orbiting in the equatorial plane of a spinning hole ,",
    "it turns out such an orbit can be obtained .",
    "we observe that for prograde photons , the size of uco decreases as the black hole spin increases , and for retrograde photons , the size of uco increases with the black hole spin .",
    "a smaller uco implies @xmath14 for a prograde beam outside a spinning black hole will be larger than for a nonspinning black hole . similarly , a larger uco for retrograde beams means its @xmath14 will be smaller than that of the schwarzschild case .",
    "the basic geometry outside a kerr smbh is illustrated in figure  [ fig : angledefkerr ] .",
    "we will use spherical coordinates @xmath17 centered at the black hole . in the strong field region ,",
    "the region of beam bending , these will be the spatial coordinates of the boyer - lindquist system .",

    ", the position of the pulsar is specified by r@xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the angle the pulsar makes with the black hole spin axis at the time of emission .",

    "the vector @xmath25 denotes the projection of @xmath24 in the orbital plane .",

    ".    our approach will be to initialize @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath19 .",
    "we will then use a public fortran code developed by dexter and agol @xcite to evaluate the trajectory of a photon through the strong field region . along with @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath19 ,",
    "the code takes as input the three constants of motion and the final radial coordinate , which is chosen large enough that photons undergo insignificant deflection for a larger radii . the conversion from our geometric parameters to the constants of motion",
    "is outlined in the appendix .",
    "the code generates final polar coordinates of the photon as output . to calculate the attenuation for",
    "any given beam , we construct a circular grid of photons closely arrayed around a central photon . using the dexter & agol code",
    "we then calculate the final positions of the central photon and of each photon on the grid .",
    "the ratio of the initial and final cross sectional areas of the grid of photons then gives the attenuation , indicating the change in intensity of the beam .",
    "finally we check that the initial grid is small enough that changing to a smaller cross section does not give a substantially different result for the attenuation ratio .",
    "to aid us in comparing pulsar - kerr black hole system with the pulsar - schwarzschild black hole system we introduce another set of angles @xmath38 and @xmath39 , illustrated in figure  [ fig : etadef ] and defined by     and @xmath40 for a photon trajectory around a spinning black hole . ]    [ eq : etadef ] @xmath41    where @xmath42 and @xmath43 were defined in section  [ sec : probability ] , and where @xmath44 is the spatial unit vector in the direction of the final motion of the photon far from the the pulsar - smbh system .",

    "we will assume the pulsar and the photon trajectories lie in the equatorial plane of the smbh .",

    "figure [ fig : etaproretro ] shows the @xmath52 angles for this simple scenario .",
    "the definition of the @xmath52 s in this scenario is similar to the @xmath29 s from the schwarzschild case ( figure  [ fig : bending ] ) , and the @xmath52 s approach the @xmath29 s as the black hole spin goes to zero .     in the equatorial plane of a kerr black hole . ]     and",
    "the top figure shows prograde beams in the equatorial plane of an @xmath53 smbh ( red ) and schwarzschild smbh ( black ) ; the bottom figure shows the same comparison for retrograde beams . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : etaoutvsin ] plots @xmath40 as a function of @xmath45 for both prograde and retrograde beams emitted by a pulsar at a distance of 100@xmath2 from an extreme ( @xmath36 = 0.99 ) kerr smbh and compares them with the curves for a nonrotating smbh .",
    "there is a late divergence of @xmath40 for prograde photons in the near extreme kerr smbh case compared to the nonrotating case .",
    "this implies a larger @xmath54 for prograde kerr beams than prograde schwarzschild beams .",
    "similarly , the early divergence of @xmath40 for retrograde beams orbiting the near extreme kerr smbh implies a smaller @xmath54 for retrograde kerr beams than retrograde schwarzschild beams , as was observed theoretically in section  [ sec : schvskerr ] .",
    "for the same models as in figure  [ fig : etaoutvsin ] .",
    "the top figure shows the comparison of the schwarzschild curve with the prograde case , the bottom with the retrograde case . ]",
    "attenuation curves are plotted in figure  [ fig : attvseta ] for the same model as in figure  [ fig : etaoutvsin ] .",
    "we notice that spin introduces a very small shift in the attenuation curve . the all - important angle @xmath55 increases by only 3@xmath56 for prograde beams in the near extreme kerr case compared to the schwarzschild case , and there is almost exactly the same decrease in @xmath55 for the retrograde case .",
    "we also notice that as deflection increases the curves are more in agreement , @xmath40 at the maximum acceptable attenuation being the same for prograde and retrograde beams in both cases , respectively .",
    "our results show that the deviations get smaller as we go out of the equatorial plane ( i.e. @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath51/2 or / and @xmath21 @xmath58 0 ) . for larger , more relevant pulsar - smbh distances ,",
    "the differences become negligible .",
    "thus , spin induces minimal effect on the attenuation curve of deflected beams , implying that the range of observability of deflected beams calculated for the pulsar - schwarzschild case remains invariant for a pulsar - near extreme kerr case .",
    "the probabilities established in paper iii of an observation with the assumption that the sgr a * black hole is not rotating are therefore unchanged even if the black hole is spinning very rapidly .",
    "the importance of beam detection lies in the potential to use deflected beams as a probe of the properties of strongly curved spacetime .",
    "for such a probe to be useful it should be sensitive to smbh spin .",
    "we have seen that smbh spin has a negligible effect on beam detectability .",
    "it is therefore important to ask whether the effect of spin on pulsar beams is so slight that pulsar timing can not be used to detect and measure spin .",
    "we aim here only for an order of magnitude demonstration , so we make several simplifying assumptions .",
    "first , we assume that the pulsar is in a circular orbit around the smbh , and that the pulsar beam is confined to the equatorial plane .",
    "the timing analysis of toas in this case has been thoroughly analyzed in paper i for a nonspinning smbh . in that analysis",
    "it was shown that there are two relativistic effects on pulsar toas .",
    "first there is the timing issue directly connected to the deflection .",
    "if the pulsar spins ( relative to distant stars ) at @xmath59 , then beams that will arrive at earth without strong deflection are pulsed at frequency @xmath59 .",
    "strongly deflected beams , on the other hand must be aimed approximately toward the smbh , and hence , for pulsar orbital angular frequency @xmath60 , are emitted approximately at frequency @xmath61 .",
    "the spin of the smbh will have a small effect on this frequency , since it will affect the precise near - smbh `` target '' towards which the to - be - deflected beam must be aimed .",
    "for simplicity we will ignore this small geometric effect , and will consider only the second relativistic effect on toas , the effect on the time of travel for a photon in a deflected beam .",
    "since the earth is nearly stationary , a pulse emitted from a particular orbital position of the pulsar , and received at the earth , has a unique @xmath40 : the angle of the final direction of the beam with respect to the radially outward direction through the pulsar at the time of emission in a spherical coordinate system centered at the galactic center ( defined in equation  , and pictured in figure  [ fig : etadef ] ) . for @xmath62 , the pulse arrival time , @xmath63 is then a measure of variation in arrival times as the pulsar travels through its orbit . for a circular orbit ,",
    "the radially outward direction through the pulsar rotates at a fixed rate , the angular velocity @xmath60 of the pulsar orbit . in the absence of strong gravity effects , @xmath63 would then be a constant .",
    "any deviation from a constant value is therefore a direct measure of strong gravity effects , and we use this rate to investigate the sensitivity of toas to smbh spin .",
    "the change in coordinate time as a pulse traverses the smbh and reaches the earth is given by @xmath64 where @xmath7 is the pulsar - smbh distance , @xmath65 is the distance between the smbh and the earth and @xmath66 is obtained from the equations of motion of a photon in the kerr geometry ( equations   and  ) .",
    "since the earth is very far away from the pulsar - smbh system , we use equation ( [ eq : coordinatetime ] ) to find the value of @xmath67 to a distance @xmath65 much larger than @xmath2 , where relativistic effects are negligible .    to compare the prograde and the retrograde pulses for a possible spin signature , we start with the absolute value of @xmath68 as a measure of the variation in the toa .",
    "we analyze @xmath63 as a function of the absolute value of @xmath40 , an indicator of the orbital position of the pulsar .",
    "if the smbh is not rotating , the prograde and the retrograde beams will suffer identical deflection and we find that this schwarzschild value @xmath69 is , of course , the same in the prograde and the retrograde cases for any @xmath40 . if the smbh is rotating , this symmetry is broken ; there will be different values of @xmath63 for prograde and retrograde orbits .",
    "we use the absolute value of @xmath70 as a measure of the spin detectibility .",
    "this measure , and all measures of deflection , depend on the closest approach of the pulsar beam to the smbh , and that closest - approach distance determines the attenuation of the toas .",
    "we choose , therefore , to compare the prograde and retrograde values of @xmath63 for fixed , relevant values of the attenuation of the pulsar beam .",
    "table [ tab : toadeviationat50 ] gives the result for 50% attenuation , i.e. , for significant deflection , and for 90% attenuation , i.e. , for the limiting deflection , the deflection beyond which attenuation is assumed to preclude observation .",
    "the tabulated values are absolute values of @xmath71 .",
    "this value is the same for the prograde and retrograde cases . in the two cases the signs are opposite ,",
    "so the total prograde / retrograde difference is twice the values tabulated .",
    "several properties of spin effects are immediately clear from the tables : the spin - induced effect , at any attentuation , is proportional to the smbh spin ; the effect depends very weakly on the pulsar - smbh distance ; the effect is stronger at the stronger deflection of the 90% deflection , but the sensitivity to deflection is not strong .",
    ".[tab : toadeviationat50 ] the value of @xmath72 , at two different attenuations .",
    "values are given in units of the smbh mass @xmath2 for two different attenuations .",
    "the values are listed for various spin parameters and pulsar - smbh distance . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for our central smbh with a mass close to 4@xmath7310@xmath74 @xcite , these differences are on the order of 1 second .",
    "the pulsars close to the galactic center are expected to be spinning at rates of order 1 second , thus the spin effects would induce a phase shift on the order of one cycle .",
    "these effects , furthermore , originate in the portion of the photon orbit close to the smbh , so this order of difference is maintained even for larger , more relevant values of pulsar - smbh distance .",
    "the conclusion , based on our limited analysis , is that pulsar timing of deflected pulses detected at the earth would be able to extract the spin signatures of the sgr a * smbh .",
    "this estimate is of course for an oversimplified picture . to get closer to an accurate prediction",
    ", we must consider more general models .",
    "a particularly important part of such an analysis would be an effect that , like spin , induces different delays for prograde and retrograde beams : the eccentricity of the orbit .",
    "preliminary calculations suggest that the pattern of timing effects due to eccentricity of pulsar orbit is , in fact , distinct from the pattern introduced by the smbh spin .",
    "the detection and analysis of pulsar beams strongly deflected by the smbh in sgr a * holds promise of providing a tool for probing strongly curved regions of spacetime .",
    "an important question has been the probability that such beams are detectable . to remedy a shortcoming of earlier estimates of such probability , we have considered here whether the spin of the sgr a * smbh can have a significant effect on detectibility .",
    "we have found that even for the conditions in which spin should have its greatest effects ( equatorial photon trajectories , near extreme rotation ) the effect of spin on detectibility is negligible .    while the effect on detectibility is negligible , we have demonstrated that the effect of spin on pulsar arrival times is significant enough that these beams , if detected , can provide us a way of determining the spin of the smbh .",
    "the fact that this determination is well within the precision of pulsar timing suggests that the timing can also determine whether the spacetime near the galactic center deviates from the kerr geometry .",
    "the motivation for an observational program therefore remains strong .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge support by the national science foundation under grants ast0545837 and hrd0734800 .",
    "we also thank the center for gravitational wave astronomy , the center for advanced radio astronomy , and the department of physics and astronomy at the university of texas at brownsville .",
