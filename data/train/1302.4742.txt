    "the black hole mass ( @xmath4 ) correlation with host galaxy properties has been one of the main issues in understanding galaxy evolution and black hole growth . in particular ,",
    "the relatively tight correlation between @xmath4 and stellar velocity dispersion ( m@xmath0-@xmath1 ) has been reported for nearby galaxies with dynamically measured @xmath4 @xcite , as well as present - day active galaxies with @xmath4 determined from reverberation - mapping results @xcite .",
    "while early studies claimed a remarkably tight m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation with its intrinsic scatter below @xmath50.3 dex ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , recent studies showed a larger intrinsic scatter and a steeper slope due to the increased sample size , inclusion of more diverse galaxies , i.e. , late - type and pseudo bulge galaxies , and the improvements of @xmath4 measurements based on better dynamical modeling and data @xcite .",
    "in understanding bh - galaxy coevolution , the present - day m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation sets a local calibration point as most observational studies investigated cosmic evolution of the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation by measuring an offset from the local relationship ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at the same time , the present - day m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation has been used for calibrating the @xmath4 of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , which is determined from the kinematics of sub - pc scale broad - emission line region . the unknown viral factor for converting the line - of - sight velocity of broad - line region gas to the intrinsic velocity ,",
    "has been empirically determined by matching the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation of quiescent and active galaxies at z @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "thus , defining the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation in the local universe is of importance to unveil the nature of bh - galaxy coevolution .",
    "stellar kinematics studies based on the near - ir stellar lines became powerful as near - ir spectrographs combined with laser - guide star adaptive optics provides the best spatial resolution for the ground - based facilities ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "moreover , measuring @xmath2 in the near - ir is more promising for agn host galaxies since agn - to - star flux ratios are much more favorable in the near - ir @xcite while it is almost impossible to measure @xmath2 in the optical for host galaxies of high luminosity qsos .    despite the increasing usage of near - ir spectra for probing stellar kinematics",
    ", a proper comparison between optical and near - ir measurements is still lacking . by measuring velocity dispersion of 25 early - type galaxies based on the co absorption band head at 2.29  in the @xmath6-band , @xcite claimed that velocity dispersion measured from near - ir stellar lines was systematically smaller by 10 - 30@xmath7 than that measured from optical stellar lines .",
    "in contrast , reported that optical and near - ir velocity dispersions were consistent for a sample of 23 early - type galaxies , by comparing @xmath2 measured from the co band heads in the @xmath6-band , with @xmath2 measured from the caii triplet .",
    "@xcite also measured velocity dispersion based on the co band heads for a sample of 22 early - type galaxies , and presented consistent results with respect to optical @xmath2 .",
    "the discrepancy among various studies may have resulted from the systematic uncertainties of the velocity dispersion measurements since the line dispersion was measured from intrinsically broad co band heads in the @xmath6-band and template mismatch could be very strong ( see * ? ? ? * ) . in contrast",
    ", the @xmath3-band spectral range ( @xmath51.6-@xmath51.7 ) contains many more stellar lines , e.g. , si i , co , and mg i than the @xmath6-band , and is possibly less susceptible to template mismatch although the presence of strong sky oh lines is a downside . to utilize the @xmath3-band stellar lines for studying stellar kinematics , a proper comparison is required between @xmath2 measured from @xmath3-band spectra with that measured from optical spectra stellar lines .    to derive reliable @xmath2 to represent the kinematics of the pressure - supported bulge or spheroidal component , the effect of the rotation component should be corrected for . in the case of galaxies with a rotating stellar disk",
    ", the line - of - sight velocity dispersion can be easily overestimated due to rotational broadening if a large aperture is used to extract a spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the effect of rotational broadening is stronger for more edge - on stellar disks , potentially producing systematic bias .",
    "thus , it is important to correct for rotational broadening .    in this paper",
    ", we measure the stellar velocity dispersion of 31 nearby galaxies using high quality @xmath3-band spectra .",
    "we compare @xmath2 measurements based on stellar lines in the @xmath3-band with optical @xmath2 measurements from the literature .",
    "we also correct for the rotation and aperture effect based on the spatially resolved kinematics measurements to improve the m@xmath0-@xmath1relation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe sample selection , observations and data reduction in   [ section : obs ] . in   3 , we present @xmath2 measurements , and the effects of rotation and aperture size . in   4 , we compare our @xmath3-band @xmath2 measurements with optical @xmath2 from the literature , and derive the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation for early - type galaxies based on the rotation - corrected @xmath2 .",
    "the main results are summarized in   [ section : sum ] .",
    "to directly compare optical and near - ir stellar velocity dispersions and to calibrate the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation , we select 31 nearby galaxies from the m@xmath0-@xmath1  sample ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for which dynamical @xmath4 measurements and optical @xmath2 measurements are available . the sample is mainly composed of early - type galaxies ( 20 ellipticals , 8 lenticulars and 3 spirals ) and spans a wide range in @xmath2 from 67 km s@xmath8 to 385 km s@xmath8 as listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "also , it covers three orders of magnitude in @xmath4 and constitutes about half the sample size of galaxies with dynamical @xmath4 measurements @xcite .",
    "observations were performed at the palomar hale 5  m telescope using the near - ir spectrograph triplespec , simultaneously covering the wavelength range from 1.0 @xmath9 to 2.4 @xmath9 . in this work",
    "we only employ the @xmath3-band spectra centered at @xmath51.7 , as it covers many stellar absorption lines suitable for the @xmath2 measurement .",
    "we place an 1@xmath10 @xmath11 30@xmath10 long - slit along the major axis of each galaxy .",
    "the spectral resolution of triplespec is r = 2500 - 2700 , corresponding to a gaussian dispersion @xmath550 km s@xmath8 . as the lowest optical @xmath2 is 67 km s@xmath8 ( for ngc 7457 ) , this spectral resolution is suitable for our study .    for sky subtraction , in particular for the strong oh sky emission lines , we also observed blank sky , offset by several arc minutes from each galaxy , since the size of each galaxy is larger than the slit length and fills the entire slit .",
    "we divide the total exposure time into segments of 200 second exposures to avoid saturation in the @xmath6-band .",
    "the total on - source exposure time ranges from 600 to 1000 seconds depending on the magnitude of individual galaxies ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we observed several a0v stars each night to correct for telluric lines .",
    "we also observed 11 k- and m - type giant stars as velocity templates for the stellar velocity dispersion determination .",
    "we performed standard data reduction , i.e. , bias subtraction , flat - fielding and wavelength calibration using a series of iraf scripts , then extracted one - dimensional spectra using various extraction windows . for telluric absorption correction , we constructed a telluric line template for each observing night , based on the spectra of a0v stars observed during the night .",
    "for each a0v star , we fitted their brackett lines with double gaussians and normalized the spectra by its continuum . dividing the observed a0v star spectrum by this model spectrum",
    "provides a telluric template .",
    "we combined all telluric templates to construct a mean template for a given night .",
    "then , we used the template to correct the galaxy spectra for telluric absorption lines . to investigate the effect of galaxy rotation on stellar velocity dispersion measurements , we extracted spatially resolved spectra from a number of small extraction windows ( 4 - 16 pixels ) along the galaxy s major axis , which were allowed to overlap with each other and to slightly increase at larger radii for obtaining better signal - to - noise .",
    "the resolution for spatial binning depends on the distance to each galaxy .",
    "typically @xmath510 spectra were extracted within a fraction of the @xmath12 ( see section 3.5 for details ) .",
    "a series of single - aperture spectra were also extracted using various aperture sizes , in order to investigate the aperture effect .",
    "many previous studies used spatially unresolved @xmath2 measurements , which were affected by line broadening due to galaxy rotation .",
    "this leads to an overestimation of the galaxy s @xmath2 , depending on how much rotation is included in the extraction aperture .",
    "thus , the choice of different aperture sizes can affect the @xmath2 measurement as presented in   3.4 .",
    "in contrast , we can correct the @xmath2 measurement for the rotational broadening using our spatially resolved spectra .",

    "this trend is in particular clearly shown for the co(6 - 3 ) line at 1.62 @xmath9 and also for the mgi line at 1.71 @xmath9 . on the other hand , the sii line strength shows no strong variation with spectral type .",

    "therefore , we excluded the measurements from k - type stars and calculated the mean @xmath2 based on the 6 m - type stars .",
    "since the m5 iii star shows slightly different line shapes compared to other m - type stars ( see figure 1 ) , we also excluded the measurement based on the m5 iii template . after calculating the standard deviation of the measurements from 6 m - type stars as the uncertainty of template mismatch , we added the uncertainty of template mismatch to the mean measurement errors from 6 m - type stars in quadrature , in order to determine the uncertainty of @xmath2 .",

    "the amplitude of the projected rotation velocity ranges from @xmath540 km s@xmath8 to over 200 km s@xmath8 while six galaxies , namely ngc 1068 , ngc 3608 , ngc 4261 , ngc 4374 , ngc 4486 and ngc 6251 show a weak or no rotation component . for the galaxies with a significant rotation component",

    "we investigate the effect of using different aperture sizes on the measured stellar velocity dispersion , by directly measuring @xmath2 from apertures of increasing size . in figure [ fig6 ]",

    "we find three different trends ( increasing , flat and decreasing ) of @xmath2 with increasing aperture size .",
    "the 8 galaxies shown in the upper panels exhibit an increase of @xmath2 as a larger aperture size is used , while for 13 galaxies shown in the lower panels , @xmath2 decreases with increasing aperture size .",
    "these galaxies show variation of @xmath2 up to 20% as aperture size changes .",
    "in contrast , 10 galaxies ( middle panels ) do not show clear change of @xmath2 as a function of aperture size .",
    "thus , when measuring @xmath2 from a large aperture it is possible to either overestimate or underestimate @xmath2 .",
    "the magnitude and direction of this bias depends on two factors : ( 1 ) the overestimation caused by rotational line broadening and ( 2 ) the natural decrease of @xmath2 as a function of radius .",
    "the galaxies in the upper panels in figure [ fig6 ] are dominated by the first effect .",
    "they show relatively strong galaxy rotation and only a mild decrease in their velocity dispersion profile , as shown in figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , leading to a net increase in @xmath2 with increasing aperture size . for these galaxies ,",
    "when the extraction aperture covers outer parts of the galaxy , where the rotation curves flatten , the aperture effect on @xmath2 also flattens .",
    "this is clearly seen for example in the case of ngc 3384 , which shows a flattening of @xmath2 beyond the third bin , corresponding to the flattening of the rotation curve in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "ngc 4742 even shows a decrease in @xmath2 beyond the radius where the rotation curves becomes flat .    the decreasing @xmath2 trend for the galaxies in the lower panels of figure [ fig6 ]",
    "can be explained in a similar way . for these galaxies",
    "the decrease in @xmath2 profile is dominating over line broadening due to rotation .",
    "for example , ngc 4486 shows the largest variation in @xmath2 as a function of aperture size since it has no significant rotation component while the velocity dispersion profile is strongly decreasing toward larger radii .",
    "similarly , ngc 3608 and ngc 4649 also show strong decrease , which is dominated by the strong decrease in @xmath2 with radius .",
    "in contrast , there are galaxies , e.g. , ngc  821 , where the effect from the rotation curve and the decreasing @xmath2 profile are roughly of the same order , leading to a small net variation of @xmath2 measured from different apertures .",
    "as discussed above , @xmath2 measured within a certain aperture will be susceptible to line broadening by galaxy rotation .",
    "in contrast , the spatially resolved stellar velocity dispersions , represented in figure [ fig4 ] and figure [ fig5 ] , do not suffer rotational broadening .",
    "thus , we can use these measurements to compute a rotation - corrected @xmath2 .",
    "we compute luminosity - weighted @xmath2 within a radius @xmath49 : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the surface brightness profile of the galaxy and @xmath49 is the outer radius within which we compute @xmath2 . using the spectral images , we measure the surface brightness profile of each galaxy by fitting with two gaussian models , and use this fit to compute the luminosity- weight for the @xmath2 measured at each radius .",
    "we chose an outer radius r for each galaxy based on the @xmath12 ( see table 1 ) . for 20 galaxies",

    "as expected , most galaxies show a decrease in velocity dispersion when accounting for the rotation component while for galaxies without strong rotation component , the correction is marginal . including 6 galaxies that show no rotation , the average correction is 6% , while the correction for individual galaxies can be up to @xmath520% .",
    "the magnitude of the rotation correction tends to be smaller for more massive galaxies .",
    "ngc 7052 with the highest @xmath2 in the sample seems to be an outlier from this trend since it has relatively large rotation while @xmath2 mildly decreases within @xmath12/8 .",
    "in summary , we find that stellar velocity dispersions measured from single - aperture spectra can be biased by up to @xmath163 .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a possible drawback for the comparison with previous studies , that usually report @xmath2 measured within @xmath12 , is the limited spatial coverage in our work , restricting our measurements to @xmath12/8 . to investigate the effect on the @xmath2 measurement",
    ", we tested two extreme cases .",
    "first , we assumed a constant @xmath2 from @xmath12/8 to @xmath12 , equal to the value at @xmath12/8 .",
    "second , we extrapolated the decreasing stellar velocity dispersion profile out to @xmath12 .",
    "for both cases we computed the luminosity - weighted @xmath2 within @xmath12 via equation  [ eq1 ] .",
    "we found that @xmath2 values decrease by only a few per cent by increasing the outer radius from @xmath12/8 to @xmath12 in both cases , due to the much lower luminosity weight at outer radii .",
    "thus , our @xmath2 measurements within @xmath12/8 will closely resemble the value that would be measured at @xmath12 .",
    "in figure 8 we compare the stellar velocity dispersions measured using our near - ir spectra ( @xmath164 ) with the literature values measured from optical spectra ( @xmath165 ) . for this comparison , we collected @xmath165 measurements from @xcite , who listed their own measurements as well as previously measured values from the literature ( see table 2 ) .",
    "although these optical measurements were based on spatially resolved stellar kinematics and the quoted values were luminosity - weighted or averaged velocity dispersions within the @xmath12 for most galaxies , these values were not homogeneously measured due to the various data quality and the measurement methods .",
    "in addition , some of these values in the original works were measured with a smaller aperture size than @xmath12 or the aperture size was not clearly stated for many cases in the original references .",
    "thus , we decide to compare both @xmath3-band @xmath2 measurements with / without rotation correction to the optical @xmath2 measurements . as shown in figure [ fig8 ] , we find no significant difference between @xmath165 and @xmath164 .",
    "the best fit between optical and near - ir measurements is close to a one - to - one relation with a scatter of @xmath50.04 dex ( 10% ) when rotation is not corrected for @xmath166 .",
    "the lower panel in fig .",
    "8 shows that the rotation - corrected @xmath166 is slightly smaller than the optical @xmath2 at lower mass range .",
    "however , the average offset is only 7% , which is not significant compared to the measurement uncertainties of stellar velocity dispersions .",
    "note that @xcite included rotation in calculating luminosity - weighted @xmath2 by adding rotation velocity to velocity dispersion in quadrature ( see their eq .",
    "thus , the slight offset between our @xmath166 and optical @xmath2 from @xcite may be explained by the rotation effect . to test this hypothesis",
    ", we derive rotation - included velocity dispersions using the same integral as adopted by ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) . for these consistently measured velocity dispersions",
    ", we find that optical and ir velocity dispersions show a one - to - one relationship with a slope of @xmath167 and a 0.03 dex ( 7% ) intrinsic scatter .",
    "thus , we conclude that @xmath2 measurements derived from optical and h - band stellar lines are consistent .",
    "while many studies have been devoted to measure @xmath2 of galaxies using optical spectra , the number of @xmath2 studies based on near - ir data , either @xmath3-band or @xmath6-band spectra is growing .",
    "however , there are currently only few studies that actually compared the results from both wavelength regimes .",
    "for example , @xcite measured @xmath2 of a sample of 25 elliptical and lenticular galaxies using the 2.29@xmath9 co(2 - 0 ) band head in the @xmath6-band spectra . comparing their ir results to optical velocity dispersions from the literature , they concluded that ir stellar velocity dispersions can be lower than optical stellar velocity dispersions , by up to 30@xmath7  40@xmath7 and with a median offset of 11@xmath7 .",
    "the inconsistency between optical and near - ir measurements is probably due to a sample bias and measurement uncertainties .",
    "first , their sample mainly consists of s0 galaxies and the systematic difference between optical and near - ir velocity dispersion in their study is mainly caused by s0 galaxies while their elliptical subsample does not show a difference between optical and near - ir measurements .",
    "second , @xcite measured @xmath2 using solely a single co band head in the @xmath6-band , which is much more susceptible to template mismatch as explained in their analysis .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , reported no inconsistency between optical and near - ir stellar velocity dispersion measurements for elliptical galaxies . using a sample of 23 elliptical galaxies and 14 merger remnants , they measured @xmath2 from stellar lines in the @xmath6-band spectra , i.e. , co ( 2 - 0 ) , co ( 3 - 1 ) , and co ( 4 - 2 ) band heads , and compare them with velocity dispersion measured from the optical caii triplet line , showing that optical and near - ir stellar velocity dispersions are virtually the same for elliptical galaxies . for merger remnants reported a discrepancy between optical and near - ir velocity dispersions , presumably due to the presence of young stellar population , which are obscured at optical wavelengths .",
    "however , for elliptical galaxies , their results indicate that optical and near - ir stellar lines represent the same kinematics and a dust effect is negligible .",
    "similarly , a recent study by @xcite presented near - ir @xmath2 measurements also based on the co band heads for a sample of 22 galaxies , consisting of similar numbers of ellipticals and lenticulars .",
    "comparing with previous optical measurements they reported that optical and near - ir @xmath2 were consistent for their sample , which is consistent with our results .    in the case of velocity dispersions using @xmath3-band stellar lines , there has been no systematic comparison with optical velocity dispersions .",
    "using various stellar lines in the @xmath3-band spectra and carefully accounting for the template mismatch problem ( see section 3.2 ) , for the first time , we show that optical and @xmath3-band @xmath2 measurements are consistent for early - type galaxies , indicating that optical and @xmath3-band stellar lines represent the same kinematics and that a dust effect , i.e. , obscuration at optical wavelengths , is negligible .",
    "these results are consistent with @xmath6-band stellar kinematics .",
    "our results imply that near - ir @xmath2 measurements carried out for agn host galaxies , for which optical measurements are more difficult to perform due to the strong agn contribution ( e.g. , woo et al .",
    "2010 ) , provide unbiased results , compared to optical measurements .",
    "in this paper we present homogeneously measured @xmath2 for 31 galaxies with dynamical @xmath4 measurements . by accounting for galaxy rotation and implementing a uniform analysis for measuring velocity dispersions , our @xmath2 measurements are slightly different from previous optical values . in this section",
    "we demonstrate the effect of these new velocity dispersions on the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation by fitting the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation for 31 galaxies , for which we obtained the rotation - corrected @xmath2 .",
    "results on the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation for the full sample of galaxies with dynamical @xmath4 will be presented in a companion paper ( woo et al .",
    "2013 in preparation ) . for this analysis",
    ", we used the most recent @xmath4 updates from @xcite .",
    "we fit the m@xmath0-@xmath1   relation as a single - index power law : @xmath168 we used the fitexy method , modified to account for intrinsic scatter in the relation @xcite , to perform the fit as shown in figure [ fig9 ] .    by fitting the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation using the optical @xmath2 from @xcite ,",
    "we obtain @xmath169 , @xmath170 and an intrinsic scatter of @xmath171 dex .",
    "our sample has a large overlap with the sample used by @xcite , and indeed we obtain consistent results for the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation .",
    "the slight difference arises mainly from a few different galaxies in both samples and from updated @xmath4 determinations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by fitting the m@xmath0-@xmath1   relation using our rotation - corrected near - ir @xmath2 , we find @xmath172 , @xmath173 and an intrinsic scatter of @xmath171 dex .",
    "this relation is slightly shallower than that derived from optical @xmath2 , but consistent within the uncertainties .",
    "note that the previous studies on the m@xmath0-@xmath1relation by @xcite and @xcite explicitly included rotation in calculating luminosity - weighted @xmath2 . in this case , we expect systematic effect on the measured @xmath2 due to the random orientation of stellar disk with respect to the line - of - sight . to investigate this effect , we calculated @xmath2 by adding velocity to velocity dispersion in quadrature using eq . 1 in @xcite .",
    "the result shows that rotation - included @xmath2 is slightly larger than rotation - corrected @xmath2 , particularly at low mass scale , by 0.02 dex ( @xmath55% ) on average with a 0.02 ( @xmath55% ) scatter .",
    "consequently , when we replace rotation - corrected @xmath2 with rotation - included @xmath2 in fitting the the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation , the slope slightly increases from @xmath174 to @xmath175 as the @xmath2 values increase preferentially at low mass scale , while intrinsic scatter remains the same .",
    "although we expect that the rotation effect will systematically affect the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation , we do not clearly detect the improvement of the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation by using rotation - corrected @xmath2 , presumably due to two reasons",
    ". first , rotation effect on the luminosity - weighted velocity dispersion may not be significant as the integrated velocity dispersions are dominated by the inner part , where the rotation velocity is relatively small . in the case of the rotation - included velocity dispersion ,",
    "the luminosity weight of the inner part is more dominant since velocity dispersions are integrated in quadrature ( see eq . 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "secondly , since our sample is mainly composed of early - type galaxies , rotation effect is relatively weak compared to late - type galaxies . for late - type galaxies with a low @xmath2 , rotation effect can be significant , hence , it would be essential to correct for , in order to properly derive the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation .    for massive bhs , the sphere of influence of bh can be large enough to change the effective @xmath2 measurements since the velocity dispersion at the center increases due to the presence of a bh .",
    "thus , by excluding the sphere of influence of bh in calculating the luminosity - weighted @xmath2 , the effective velocity dispersions will be decreased .",
    "since these corrections can be done only for massive galaxies with a resolved sphere of influence , the slope of the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation will increase due to the preferential decrease of @xmath2 at high mass end .",
    "for example , by excluding the sphere of influence of bh in deriving the effective @xmath2 within r@xmath176 for 12 most massive galaxies , @xcite showed that the slope of the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation increased from @xmath177 to @xmath178 .",
    "we performed a similar analysis using our data although only two galaxies , ngc 4486 and ngc 4649 , are among those 12 galaxies with a resolved sphere of influence . by excluding the sphere of influence of bh ,",
    "the luminosity - weighted @xmath2 decreases from @xmath179 to @xmath180 for ngc 4486 , and from @xmath179 to @xmath180 for ngc 4649 .",
    "based on these two updated @xmath2 , the slope of the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation slightly increases from @xmath174 to @xmath181 , however two slopes are consistent within the uncertainties . using only 2 galaxies , it is not clear whether excluding or including the sphere of influence in determining the effective @xmath2 improves the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation .",
    "compared to the m@xmath0-@xmath1   relation recently presented by @xcite , we find a significantly shallower slope .",
    "they report a slope of @xmath178 , using a much larger galaxy sample , which includes in particular more galaxies at higher and lower masses . we will investigate the implications of our results on the m@xmath0-@xmath1   relation in detail in a companion paper ( woo et al .",
    "2013 in preparation ) .",
    "we observed a sample of 31 nearby galaxies with triplespec , a near - ir long - slit spectrograph at the palomar 5-m telescope in order to homogeneously measure velocity dispersions from the @xmath3-band stellar lines .",
    "the galaxies in the sample cover a wide range in @xmath2 ( 67 km s@xmath8 @xmath182 @xmath2 @xmath182 385 km s@xmath8 ) and their dynamical central bh masses are also available . to account for template mismatch",
    ", we used 11 giant stars with spectral type ranging from k0 to m5 as velocity templates , and found that m giants generate the most reliable fits and velocity dispersion measurements .    by measuring velocity and velocity dispersion as a function of radius along the major axis of each galaxy , we determined the rotation curve and velocity dispersion profile . using these spatially resolved velocity dispersion measurements , we calculated the luminosity - weighted stellar velocity dispersions within the @xmath12 of each galaxy . for 25 out of 31 galaxies in the sample",
    ", we found a clear rotation component , indicating that stellar velocity dispersions can be significantly overestimated due to the rotational broadening if a large single aperture is used to extract spectra . compared to rotation - corrected velocity dispersions , velocity dispersions measured from single - aperture spectra showed systematically larger values by up to @xmath520@xmath7 .",
    "we compared velocity dispersions measured from @xmath3-band stellar lines with those measured from optical lines and found no systematic difference , suggesting that optical and @xmath3-band stellar lines represent the same kinematics and that dust effect is negligible for early - type galaxies .",
    "our results confirm that optical and near - ir stellar lines can be interchangeably used to measure stellar kinematics and near - ir @xmath2 measured for agn host galaxies can be directly compared to optical @xmath2 of quiescent galaxies .",
    "using the rotation - corrected @xmath2 measurements based on the spatially - resolved h - band spectra of 31 nearby galaxies , we derived the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation to investigate rotation effect .",
    "the slope of the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation is slightly shallower than that based on the rotation - included optical or near - ir @xmath2 measurements .",
    "although rotation effect is not dramatically strong for early - type galaxies , it is potentially important to correct for , particularly for low mass , late - type galaxies with a strong rotation component , in order to properly determine the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation and its intrinsic scatter . a future study based on spatially resolved spectra for late - type galaxies is required to fully quantify rotation effect on the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation .",

    "<S> based on the spatially - resolved rotation and velocity dispersion measurements along the major axis of each galaxy , we find that a rotating stellar disk is present for 80% of galaxies in the sample . for galaxies with a rotation component , @xmath1 measured from a single aperture spectrum can vary by up to @xmath520% , depending on the size of the adopted extraction aperture . to correct for the rotational broadening </S>",
    "<S> , we derive luminosity - weighted @xmath2 within the effective radius of each galaxy , providing uniformly measured velocity dispersions to improve the m@xmath0-@xmath1  relation . </S>"
