    "k - band observations of  @xcite show that the two brightest stars consistent with the very large array ( vla ) radio position appear to be a low - mass k - type red giant and a main - sequence f star ; more massive stars , which might fuel wind accretion , are ruled out .    for , @xcite suggested a companion later than b2 , but their argument was indirect .",
    "the upper limit was on 6  cm radio flux ; uv from an earlier companion would produce so much ionization in a positionally coincident molecular cloud that a compact hii region would have been seen with the vla .",
    "this argument relies on being within the cloud and not behind or in front of it .",
    "emission - line observations have been used to argue that it is indeed within the cloud @xcite , but the small amplitude of the 6.4  kev iron fluorescence line from the source has been used to argue that it is behind the cloud @xcite or in front of it @xcite .",
    "the deepest k - band observations near  were recently made with the very large telescope ( vlt ) of the european southern observatory @xcite .",
    "four stars of k magnitude 18.5 - 19.0 are about 1  from the vla position , and each might represent a massive companion .",

    "optical emission has been seen frequently from , which shows less absorption than either  or , and is probably closer .",
    "the optical spectrum has always been consistent with an accretion disk , however , so there has been no spectral classification of the companion .",
    "optical observations taken when the x - ray luminosity was very low @xcite imply an upper limit of ( 0.6 @xmath2 0.2 ) l@xmath3 for the companion at the farthest estimated distance of 4  kpc @xcite and one tenth of that at the closest estimated distance of 1.3 kpc @xcite . @xcite derived a somewhat higher extinction ( a@xmath4 = 3.4 - 4 ) than that taken by @xcite from @xcite ( a@xmath4 = 2.2 ) , which would increase the upper limit to about 3 l@xmath3 . even at this highest upper limit , the companion can not be a high - mass star providing a significant wind .",

    "this state , one of the two canonical states of black - hole candidates at moderate luminosity , is characterized by a hard power law ( photon index 1.4 to 1.9 ) with an exponential rollover around 100 kev .",
    "the other canonical state , `` soft '' or `` high '' , is characterized by a softer power law with no exponential cutoff , plus a thermal component with a temperature on the order of 1 kev which can dominate the overall luminosity .",
    "there can be a gradual transition between these canonical states , now usually called an intermediate state @xcite",
    ". it has recently been discovered , however , that at least one property of this state is not intermediate at all : @xcite found that the lags between rapid variations in soft and hard flux are far longer during state transitions of  than in either the soft or hard states .",
    "the `` very high '' state , characterized by high accretion rates and more complicated behaviors , is beyond the scope of this paper , never having been displayed by ,  or .",
    "one common picture of accretion in these systems is a standard thin accretion disk at large radii , which is truncated at some inner radius and replaced by a hot , more spherical flow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the thin disk produces thermal emission and the hot flow scatters it up into a power law .",
    "the transition from the low state to the high state is thought to occur when the accretion rate increases , with the result that the transition radius moves inward until the thin disk extends all the way down to the last stable orbit allowed by general relativity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the count rates ( figure 3a ) are for asm channels 2 + 3 and for the pca data restricted to the same range ( 3.0 - 12.1 kev ) .",
    "the pca data show more variation not because of statistical errors , which are far smaller than the plotting symbols used , but because they represent a single ( 3000 s ) snapshot instead of the average of a series of snapshots taken over a week , as is the case with the asm data .",
    "this indicates a significant power at frequencies between about 1 and 300 @xmath5hz , an interesting phenomenon beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "we do not expect that this relation applies for the softest data of figure 2 , where the disk blackbody emission could dominate channel 2 , since this did not occur in 1998 .",

    "the asm coverage of any given point in the sky is irregular , so when the data are accumulated on a weekly basis as in figure 2 , there are periods where the statistics are so poor that a plot of the data is difficult to interpret .",
    "we therefore produced figure 4 by accumulating sets of 50 consecutive asm snapshots and averaging them together .",
    "one clear state transition can be see in 1998 .",
    "unfortunately , the transitions into and out of the soft state both occurred around january , when the _ rxte pointing schedule , driven by a sun - angle constraint , results annually in very poor coverage of the galactic center region by the asm . _    finally , figure 5 shows the asm rate and ratio data for , with one - week accumulations as in figure 2 .",
    "the hard x - ray spectra of this source are more complicated than the others , including variable absorption and a very bright iron line , presumably due to the effects of a very dense wind from its companion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have therefore not attempted to convert the channel 2 to channel 3 ratio into a power - law index , but we leave it as the measure of softness for this source .      there is a strong contrast in the behaviors shown in figures 1 and 2 . in , the curves of brightening and softening appear almost identical , while they have a very different time - dependence in and .",
    "this phenomenon is the principal result of this paper . in order to make the relations between these quantities clearer in all three sources , we have derived figures 6 - 9 from the raw data in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "these figures compare the pli with both the photon flux and the time derivative of the photon flux for each source . in order to produce a set of standard comparisons ,",
    "the count rates have had the instrumental responses and interstellar absorption removed and they are extrapolated to the range 2 - 100 kev using the fitted pli .",
    "this range was chosen to represent the total photon flux in the power law part of the spectrum of each source . above 100 kev",
    "the photon flux is small for both hard and soft state spectra , and below 100 kev the error introduced in the hard state by ignoring the exponential rolloff is also small .",

    "when the energy flux from 2 - 100 kev is used in place of the photon flux ,  and  still show a better correlation with the flux derivative than with the flux , but the correlations are weaker and the sign of the lag is reversed : the energy flux derivative leads the pli ( figures 10 and 11 ) .",
    "the corresponding plot for  using the energy flux looks similar to the photon flux plot ( figure 6 ) . because we do nt have a formula like equation 1 to convert the  asm channel ratio to a pli",

    "the second dotted line shows the time at which it hardens again .",
    "note that at this time the flux has already dropped to a level considerably lower than that at which the power law first softened .",
    "although this is a very small amount of data , qualitatively we might say that  resembles during the rise ( softening correlated with flux ) and  and during the decline ( a soft spectrum while the flux decreases ) .",
    "it has been noted that some black - hole x - ray nova outbursts have a hard - to - soft transition at high luminosity followed by a soft - to - hard transition at much lower luminosity @xcite .",
    "in addition to citing the well - studied x - ray nova gs  1124 - 683 ( nova muscae 1991 ) , miyamoto et al . found evidence for a non - simultaneous change of flux and pli in  using data taken by several instruments in 1988 and 1991 .",
    "the total luminosity in the power law spectral component peaked as the pli was making a transition from -2 to -3 .",
    "although most of the large variations in count rate and pli in and  have been well sampled by our observing program ( see figure 1 ) , each source has on at least one occasion changed too rapidly for us to follow the change in detail .",
    "each of these events is worth special consideration , since the strongest tests of theoretical models for these sources may come from the most extreme variations .",
    "near the end of 2001 february , the power law flux from  dropped by an order of magnitude between one pointing and the next , leaving behind a spectrum dominated by a weak blackbody component . based on a model of two",
    "accretion flows ( a sub - keplerian halo and a thin disk ) , we predicted @xcite that mass input from the companion had ceased , and that the blackbody should decay smoothly over the following weeks .",
    "it did so , with a time constant of roughly 28 dy @xcite .",
    "both the sharp drop ( due to the abrupt loss of the power - law component ) and the subsequent decay of the soft flux are visible in the count rate plot of figure 1 .",
    "this decaying state was similar to the usual black hole `` soft '' or `` high '' state , both because it was dominated by thermal emission and because there was no detectable fast x - ray variability .",
    "a low - luminosity soft state for this source was previously inferred by @xcite from data taken between 1991 fall and 1992 spring : during this period , _ granat found only upper limits above 3 kev , while _ rosat made a good spectral measurement from 1 - 2.4 kev .",
    "the combined data sets imply that the spectrum had to be both faint and soft .",
    "these results differ from the canonical `` high / soft '' state in that the soft spectrum appears at much lower luminosity than the hard state .",
    "the hard to soft transition is usually said to result from an increase in accretion rate and usually involves an increase in luminosity . _ _",
    "a single pointing on 2001 may 14 found that  had suddenly jumped from one of softest plis ever seen from this source ( 2.23 @xmath2 0.02 ) to one of the hardest ( 1.49 @xmath2 0.02 ) @xcite .",
    "as can be seen in figure 12 , the 2 - 100 kev ( extrapolated ) photon flux remained virtually unchanged while the spectrum hardened , so that the 2 - 100 kev energy flux briefly doubled , returning at the next pointing to its previous value .",
    "the raw pca count rate ( 2.5 - 25 kev ) increased slightly ( this can be seen in figure 1 ) .",
    "if this one point was taken out of the data , the behavior in this period would be very similar to what we observe at other times : a softening preceeding a drop in the photon flux by about 10 dy ( see above ) .",
    "we can be fairly certain that the may 14 result is not due to a second , very hard source turning on in the pca field of view , because the hardening involved not just an increase in high - energy counts , but also a decrease in low - energy counts .",
    "although this may be a rare sort of event , it might also be common but short - lived , and detected only once for that reason .",
    "has long been the prototype which theories of black - hole accretion have tried to model . the results above make it clear that there can be a richer variety of behavior even in other persistent black - hole binaries than is observed in . specifically , any model in which a single variable ( e.g. a single accretion rate ) controls both the luminosity and the spectrum is clearly inadequate to explain the behavior of  and , even if it is extremely successful with .",
    "the clearest contrast in behavior is between  and : the pli correlates with the photon flux in the former and its derivative in the latter .",
    "is very much like  in this regard , and  is more like .",
    "more data are clearly needed to place  firmly in either category . in @xmath191 , we reviewed the status of knowledge about the companion of each source . for , , and , we can say that the sources with probable high - mass companions ( wind accretors ) have the pli tracking with the flux , and the source with a probable low - mass companion has the pli tracking the flux derivative .",
    "the situation is less clear for  and , in the former case because there are not enough data on the x - ray behavior , and in the latter case because there is neither a convincing measurement or upper limit for the companion .",
    "if the correlation between companion type and x - ray behavior holds , the size of the accretion disk may be what distinguishes the two sorts of x - ray behavior .",
    "wind accretors are expected to have a very small specific angular momentum in the accreting material , and therefore should form a very small disk . the complicated behavior in  and",
    "might then be related to viscous propagation delays that are much smaller in . for a constant coefficient of kinematic viscosity , @xmath20 , the viscous timescale in a standard thin disk @xmath21 @xcite",
    ", so the accretion disk of  would only have to be an order of magnitude smaller than that of the lmxrbs to have a timescale @xmath22 1 dy ; i.e. it could still be over a thousand gravitational radii ( @xmath23 ) in size . one recent model of wind - fed accretion @xcite produces a standard hard - state spectrum with a very quickly accreting , `` inviscid '' disk that is extremely small : only 14@xmath23 . compact objects which accrete via roche - lobe overflow , however , have disks of a size on the order of the binary separation .",
    "these large disks have a viscous timescale ( spiraling in of matter ) which can be on the order of days to months @xcite , and could therefore be related to the time lags between correlated quantities in figures 8 and 9 .",
    "the @xmath24 28-dy decay of  in the soft state @xcite may be a direct measurement of the viscous timescale in that source .",
    "another significant difference between  on the one hand and  and  on the other is that the latter sources have bright radio lobes @xcite .",
    "this could be a consequence of disk size being related to jet collimation , of disruption of incipient jets by the companion wind in , or of some other phenomenon .",
    "if a substantial fraction of the hard x - ray emission in  and occurred in the jets instead of near the disk , one might suggest that the time delays are due to the time required for information about changes in the accretion rate to propagate along the jet to the emitting region ( e.g. a shock ) .",
    "the spectrum observed in  as its emission shut off early in 2001 @xcite eliminates this possibility , however . that spectrum was dominated by a soft thermal component , brighter at first than any that was ever seen in the hard state .",
    "since disk and jet spectral components would simply add , the thermal flux can not be the jet emission since it is not usually seen in the hard state .",
    "the hard - to - soft transition in  has sometimes been explained in the context of a central hot , advection - dominated flow with an outer thin disk , the transition radius determined by the accretion rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as the accretion rate increases , the central hot flow becomes unstable to collapse because it can cool itself more efficiently by bremsstrahlung .",
    "here we will refer to this as a `` static '' soft state , since it can be reached by a gradual , quasi - static change in the accretion rate . in  and ,",
    "the softest spectra observed are related to dropping photon fluxes ( see figures 8 & 9 ) .",
    "because the spectral state is related to the rate of change of luminosity , we refer to this as a `` dynamical '' soft state .",
    "clearly it can not be related to high accretion rates ;  showed a soft spectrum down to a few percent of its usual hard luminosity when it shut off @xcite .      in paper",
    "i , we had only the episodes of brightening and softening occurring in  and  in 1998 to look at .",
    "from these data alone , there was no way to tell whether the pli was following the same profile as the photon flux but with a delay , or whether it instead followed the flux s derivative ( these options would of course be completely indistinguishable for sinusoidal variations ) .",
    "it is the newer data , including sharp drops in the count rate resulting in more significant softenings , which have decided the question .",
    "we suggested two qualitative models in the paper i for explaining the lack of simultaneity in the variations in flux and pli . both pictures involved the simultaneous presence of two accretion flows : a thin keplerian disk and a hot , sub - keplerian halo ( e.g. an advection - dominated flow @xcite or a shocked flow @xcite ) .",
    "our first picture followed a prediction of @xcite : the sub - keplerian flow might exist at all radii , not just within a transition radius , and if the mass accretion rate was boosted to both components at once , the halo would brighten at all radii almost instantaneously ( near the free - fall timescale ) , while the inner regions of the thin disk would only brighten after the extra mass had wound its way in on the viscous timescale .",
    "we suggested that when this finally happened , the extra soft photons would cool the halo and the spectrum would soften .    our second picture followed a suggestion by @xcite related to the soft - to - hard state transition in the decaying phase of soft x - ray transients .",
    "he suggested that , for accretion rates where both thin - disk and advection - dominated flows are stable , the thin disk may tend to persist once it is established , i.e. the evaporation back to the advection - dominated flow is slow and inefficient .",
    "thus , even if the brightening is quasi - static ( i.e. the accretion rate changes slowly compared to the viscous timescale ) , there can still be a soft stage at the end of the outburst when the accretion rate is low again but the thin disk persists .",
    "most disk analyses concentrate on finding stable solutions ; the issue of transformations between stable states is difficult and much less well - explored .    provides a perfect test case to distinguish between these two pictures . since it is expected to have a very short viscous timescale ( see above ) , under the first picture ( viscous delay ) , we would expect a much shorter delay . the second picture ( the persistent disk )",
    "depends only on a hypothetical property of the inner disk , which should be roughly independent of the outer parts of the accretion flow .",
    "thus , the simultaneity of brightening and softening in figure 2 causes us to prefer the viscous delay picture @xcite over the slow - evaporation picture for the delay in  and .",
    "since we now have considerably more data , showing greater excursions in pli , a deeper examination of the two - flow picture @xcite is warranted .",
    "the hard component in black - hole - candidate spectra has long been attributed to inverse compton scattering of soft disk photons by energetic electrons , usually but not always thermal .",
    "these hot electrons have been hypothesized to reside in several places , often a hot , central region of the disk or a halo or corona above the disk .",
    "the pli of the comptonized component is a function of the temperature and optical depth of the comptonizing plasma .",
    "@xcite have modeled coronae above the disk and found that , for accretion rates much less than eddington , the halo temperature is nearly constant at a value of about kt  =  100  kev even as the accretion rate varies by up to four orders of magnitude .",
    "a similar result was found by @xcite , but the hot region was a shocked plasma , originating from a sub - keplerian flow , and occupying the radially innermost part of the accretion flow .",
    "the constant temperature holds as long as the dominant cooling mechanism for the halo is the comptonization of soft photons and the accretion is significantly sub - eddington .",
    "the highest luminosities derived from the  and  data of figure 1 are 9.8 and 5.4  @xmath25 erg @xmath26 s@xmath27 ( extrapolated to 2 - 100  kev and with interstellar absorption removed ) . for a galactic center distance of 8.5 kpc",
    ", this gives 8.5 and 4.7  @xmath28 erg s@xmath27 , or about 7% and 4% of the eddington luminosity for a 10  m@xmath29 black hole , so these objects could plausibly be in the constant - temperature regime , in which the pli depends only on the optical depth @xmath15 of the scattering region .    in unsaturated comptonization ,",
    "the pli @xcite is @xmath30 where the spectrum in photons @xmath26 s@xmath27 kev@xmath31 .",
    "the comptonization parameter @xmath32 and @xmath33 is a function only of the halo electron temperature @xmath34 : @xmath35 which we are taking as constant .",
    "then , at @xmath36100  kev , @xmath37^{-1 } \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\rm{or }   \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ;   3.3^{1/2 } \\left [ ( \\gamma + \\frac{1}{2})^2 - \\frac{9}{4}\\right]^{-1/2},\\ ] ] whichever is less . with this assumption , @xmath15 for  and  remains close to 1 , varying only from 0.44 to 1.39 .",
    "since @xmath15 increases monotonically as @xmath8 decreases , its correlations with photon flux , energy flux , and their derivatives are of the opposite sign and similar magnitude ( figures 13 - 17 and table 1 ) .    for an accreting halo flow with an unchanging geometry and constant infall speed",
    ", @xmath15 is proportional to the accretion rate in this flow , @xmath38 .",
    "thus , if the geometry , infall speed , and temperature of the halo are all constant , the pli ( via @xmath15 ) is a surrogate for @xmath38 .",
    "if we could additionally postulate that the photon flux @xmath10 is a surrogate for the flow in the thin disk , @xmath39 , and that the hot halo is an independent flow , then figures 13 - 15 could be interpreted in simple and compelling ways .",
    "for  and , where we have a good correlation in the second panel , we would have @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the lag shown in table 1 .",
    "the mean value is subtracted from @xmath15 because of the offset to zero average imposed on all the curves in these figures .",
    "this offset has little effect on @xmath17 , since it already averages nearly to zero , there being no major long - term trends in the count rates .    equation 6 suggests that the flow in the thin disk at any time is an integration of the halo flow in the recent past .",
    "this would be expected if there were two independent accretion flows : a thin disk ( with its slow time constant ) and the halo ( nearly in free fall ) , and if they were supplied with proportional amounts of matter at large radii at any given time .",
    "the possibility of complicated variations of pli and luminosity as a result of independent disk and halo flows was predicted by @xcite .",
    "integration and delay are both natural consequences of viscous propagation in a thin disk @xcite .    under these assumptions ( constant halo temperature and @xmath10 proportional to disk accretion rate )",
    ", the observed behavior of , with a strong inverse correlation in the top panel of figure 13 , could result from @xmath42 in other words , the state transitions could be due to the mass input switching back and forth between going mostly into the halo flow and mostly into the disk .",
    "this is an appealing picture of  for two reasons .",
    "first , the bolometric luminosity is , in fact , very nearly constant during state transitions of @xcite , which is not the case for other black - hole candidates . second , models which attribute the state changes to a change in a single accretion rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) require the average accretion rate to be in the narrow range of values near where the hard - to - soft transition naturally occurs .",
    "if the state transitions are instead due to the swapping of the accretion flow between two modes , they could occur over a wide range of total accretion rates .",
    "the principal problem with these simple and compelling pictures is the use of @xmath10 as a surrogate for the thin disk flow .",
    "if the thin disk were a point source of soft photons at the center of a large , optically thick comptonizing cloud , then every photon observed in the power law would have its origin in the thin disk , and ( nearly ) every photon emitted by the thin disk would end up in the power law .",
    "such a halo has been postulated by @xcite to explain the frequency dependence of lags between soft and hard photons at sub - second timescales in black - hole candidates . if the thin disk were a blackbody or a set of concentric blackbodies at different temperatures , then @xmath10 ( first from the thin disk and , after comptonization , in the power law ) would go as @xmath43 , not very different from @xmath39 . for a halo which is close to the disk and tenuous , however , as is sometimes the case in recent models , @xmath44 ,",
    "most disk photons are not comptonized , and @xmath10 in the power law can be at least as strong a function of @xmath38 as @xmath39 .",
    "a thin halo near the disk also re - heats the disk with some of the comptonized flux , further complicating the issue . that influence would be lessened if the halo flow were geometrically large , so that most of the comptonized flux does not intersect the thin disk , or if it had relativistic bulk motion away from the disk , so that the comptonized photons moved preferentially outward @xcite .",
    "finally , viscous action in the disk should not only delay but also smooth out variations in the input to the accretion disk . if the @xmath10 were a good surrogate for the disk accretion flow , it would therefore have less overall variability than the halo flow ( represented for the sake of this discussion by @xmath15 ) .",
    "this is not the case , however . for @xmath45 ,",
    "the first exponent in equation 5 is applicable . in this case , the rms variability in @xmath15 and in @xmath10 are remarkably similar .",
    "the rms variabilities in @xmath10 and @xmath15 are 19% and 18% respectively in  and 22% and 21% in .",
    "this ca nt be seen in figures 14 - 15 ( top panels ) because of the scaling used , which automatically sets the rms to 1 , but the result is that for @xmath45 the upper panels in these figures would look the same even without the re - scaling . for @xmath46 , the second exponent in equation 5 applies and the problem is aggravated : the rms variabilites in @xmath15 are only 9.4% in and 11% in , where we would expect them to be higher than the variabilities in @xmath10 .",
    "on the other hand , the event of 2001 may 14 in  ( figure 12 ) involves both the pli and energy flux undergoing a large change while the photon flux remains unchanged .",
    "this shows that @xmath10 can sometimes have the slowest response to sudden changes , an expected characteristic of the inner disk accretion rate .",
    "our purpose , however , is not to argue that a very large , optically thick halo with a uniform temperature actually exists .",
    "rather , it is to stimulate more realistic theoretical work , and to point out that any model of accretion in black - hole binaries must have at least the potential to explain the behavior epitomized by figure 8 .",
    "we have used a model of two independent flows and the postulated equivalence in equation 6 as a starting point . in a realistic two - flow model , the observables @xmath10 and @xmath8",
    "would both be functions of both @xmath39 and @xmath38 . if the two - flow idea is valid , making these relations more physical would result in maintaining the time lag between @xmath38 and @xmath39 while making the rms variability of the former greater than the latter .    the disk and halo flows need not have an independent origin as they do in @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite discussed how an initially keplerian corona , produced by evaporation from the disk , could lose angular momentum and accrete rapidly due to radiation drag from a central luminous source ( i.e. a neutron star ) .",
    "greater luminosity from the outer keplerian thin disk would stabilize against this effect .",
    "for a black - hole system , we take the central radiation source as being the innermost region of the disk itself . if the mass input to the thin disk dropped suddenly , the inner disk radiation would at first dominate over the outer disk radiation since the drop would not yet have propagated inward .",
    "thus the corona would accrete more quickly than normal .",
    "if the corona is produced at a constant rate by evaporation , the result would be a thinner corona and a softer power - law .",
    "once the drop in accretion rate had propagated to the innermost regions , the former disk / corona ratio would re - establish itself and the spectrum would harden again at a lower luminosity .",
    "this reproduces the qualitative behavior in figures 8 and 9 : a softening precedes a drop in flux . what this picture has in common with @xcite is the viscous delay in the thin disk as the cause of the complication in the observed behavior",
    "we have found that black - hole candidates  and  display long - term behavior very different from the well - known variation of .",
    "the primary result , that the pli varies as the negative derivative of the power - law flux instead of directly with it , is at least suggestive of a model with both slow ( disk ) and fast ( halo ) accretion flows .",
    "our observations come at a time when there is mounting evidence that even the outer parts of accretion disks contain a vertically extended flow as well as a standard thin disk .",
    "@xcite observed the low - mass x - ray binary exo  074867 with the reflection grating spectrometer on the _ xmm - newton observatory .",
    "although this is an eclipsing binary , they found very bright x - ray emission lines which do not vary with the variation of the continuum from the central source . from this lack of variability and the details of the absorption and emission in the spectrum",
    ", they concluded that there must be a significant flow at large radii with a height much greater than that predicted by hydrostatic equilibrium of a thin disk .",
    "@xcite observed another dipping binary , x1624490 , with _",
    "they found that the comptonization region which produces the hard x - ray continuum is never completely occulted during dips , while the blackbody from the central source is . from the broad profile of the dips",
    ", they deduced that the hard - x - ray - emitting region was @xmath47 cm in radius or larger , within a factor of two of the full presumed size of the thin accretion disk based on the 21-hour orbit of the system . _ _",
    "@xcite described certain correlations in the atoll sources ( neutron - star binaries ) 4u  0614 + 091 and 4u  160852 that might also be due to independent disk and halo flows . in those sources ,",
    "the frequency of the kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) correlates well with the power - law index @xcite and , for 4u  0614 + 091 , with the disk blackbody flux @xcite . neither these sources , nor the kilohertz qpo sources in general , show a long - term correlation between qpo frequency and luminosity .",
    "@xcite suggested that the thin - disk accretion rate may control the blackbody luminosity , the qpo frequency , and ( via compton cooling of the halo ) the power - law index , while the overall luminosity ( dominated by the power - law ) is controlled by the halo accretion rate .",
    "our secondary conclusion is that there can be two causes of spectral softening in black - hole binaries : the well - modeled static soft state , in which the accretion rate becomes high enough to force the innermost part of the halo into the thin disk configuration , and a newly - discovered dynamical soft state , occurring whenever the photon flux is dropping . in the context of a picture of two independent accretion flows , the dynamical soft state would occur when the inner thin disk has yet to respond to a drop in accretion which has already depleted the halo .    because persistent black hole candidates are rare , there are only a few more immediately available tests of the ideas developed here .",
    "lmc  x3 is one source we have not yet examined .",
    "it is too faint for the _ rxte asm data to be useful spectrally , and the pca monitoring observations so far , although they have revealed that the source does undergo soft / hard transitions @xcite , have been too few to provide evidence for or against viscous delay . with a main sequence companion of only modestly high mass ( b3 v ) ,",
    "it is probably a disk accretor , and may therefore be a good candidate for delays . , which we expect to show delays , may provide more conclusive data than the hint visible in figure 4 .",
    "a new pca monitoring campaign for this source began in 2001 march .",
    "finally , the _ xmm - newton x - ray telescope has sufficient sensitivity to measure spectra of sources as faint as  and  in m31 with a reasonable exposure time ( @xmath22 1 dy ) .",
    "a monitoring campaign of the m31 bulge region could reveal a number of new sources with behavior similar to  and .",
    "if this behavior is indeed due to viscous delay in the disk , this campaign would produce a census of high - mass versus low - mass binaries using viscous delay as a distinguishing diagnostic .",
    "_ _    in future work we will consider the connection between the behavior exhibited by  and  and that observed in the x - ray novae or soft x - ray transients .",
    "the transient systems , exemplified by nova muscae 1991 ( gs  1124683 ) , tend to brighten in their hard state , change to the soft state near their peak , and decay in the soft state , returning to the hard state only at much lower luminosities @xcite . , much more variable than  and  but more persistent than the transients , may serve to clarify the connection ."
