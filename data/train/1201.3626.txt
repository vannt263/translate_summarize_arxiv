    "the hubbard model has served as a framework to study strongly correlated electrons for almost five decades.@xcite its relative simplicity compared to more realistic models is largely based on approximating the electron - electron coulomb interaction by an onsite repulsion @xmath4 between electrons of opposite spin .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian captures many aspects of strong correlations , including the mott transition at half filling .",
    "detailed knowledge about the model can be obtained by combining the bethe ansatz with the bosonization technique.@xcite however , experiments on quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems such as quantum wires,@xcite carbon nanotubes,@xcite or self - organized atom chains @xcite fall outside the range of validity of the hubbard model .",
    "this is evinced by the possibility of an insulating , charge - ordered state at quarter filling , substantial @xmath3 charge correlations , or by a luttinger liquid ( ll ) interaction parameter smaller than 1/2 . within a quasi-1d description ,",
    "these features imply electron - electron interactions of finite range .",
    "the case of one dimension is particularly interesting due to the breakdown of fermi liquid theory , the importance of collective excitations , and the emergence of spin - charge separation .",
    "these phenomena can be understood in the framework of bosonization,@xcite which provides a description in terms of a few nonuniversal parameters valid asymptotically at long wavelengths and low energies .",
    "in particular , knowledge of these parameters fully characterizes the correlation functions .",
    "the 1d hubbard model , describing a screened , onsite interaction , is a mott insulator for any @xmath5 at half filling .",
    "away from half filling , umklapp scattering is not allowed and the system remains metallic .",
    "the ll interaction parameter takes on values @xmath6 , leading to dominant spin density wave correlations .",
    "a finite interaction range permits mott or charge - density - wave ( cdw ) transitions of the kosterlitz - thouless type at other commensurate fillings @xmath7 , for example at quarter filling in the @xmath4-@xmath8 model with onsite ( @xmath4 ) and nearest - neighbor ( @xmath8 ) repulsion.@xcite in contrast to the hubbard model , such transitions occur at a finite critical @xmath4 determined by the condition @xmath9 .",
    "the effects of extended - range interactions depend on the details .",
    "for example , the intuitive picture of long - range interactions driving the system to strong coupling does not always apply : for spinless fermions , the critical interaction for the metal - cdw transition is larger for the @xmath10 potential than for a nearest - neighbor repulsion;@xcite for spinfull fermions , a transition seems to be absent for the unscreened potential up to very strong interactions.@xcite    the @xmath10 coulomb potential realized in , e.g. , nanotubes and quantum wires , represents the extreme limit of long - range interactions .",
    "the logarithmic divergence of its fourier transform gives rise to remarkable differences , most notably the metallic wigner crystal ( wc ) state with quasi - long - range @xmath3 charge correlations,@xcite and the existence of plasmon excitations .",
    "strictly speaking , the divergence only exists for infinite systems and in the absence of screening .",
    "consequently , the above phenomena are absent for any large but finite interaction range , and the bare coulomb potential can be regarded as a special point in parameter space distinct from the ll liquid fixed point .",
    "the @xmath10 potential has been studied analytically@xcite and numerically.@xcite    the typical experimental situation is most likely intermediate between the hubbard limit and the bare @xmath10 potential . within bosonization",
    ", a finite interaction range only leads to a renormalization of the ll parameters.@xcite however , in contrast to the hubbard model , there exist no analytical methods to calculate the ll parameters exactly for nontrivial cases . besides , the bosonization results rely on a linear band dispersion , and are valid only at low energies and long wavelengths , a limit which is nontrivial to achieve both in experiment and in numerical simulations . on the other hand ,",
    "exact numerical methods are valid at all energies and distances and permit , e.g. , the calculation of spectral weights of excitations .",
    "they provide a quantitative connection to microscopic model parameters , and can be used to study intermediate interaction ranges .",
    "the 1d nature of the problem makes numerical methods particularly powerful .    in this work we study the effect of the electron - electron interaction range using exact , large - scale quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations and exact diagonalization .",
    "the model chosen here makes significant simplifications over typical experimental situations , but we believe that our findings are rather general .",
    "one of the key results is the ll interaction parameter @xmath0 , which allows us to estimate the interaction strength and range required to reproduce the experimentally observed values .",
    "we also study the evolution of static and dynamical correlation functions as a function of the interaction range .",
    "importantly , we find that spin - charge separation in the single - particle spectrum is robust against increasing the interaction range .",
