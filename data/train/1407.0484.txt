    "globular clusters ( gcs ) have long been considered the best example of _ single stellar populations _ , i.e. , stellar systems formed by stars with the same age and initial chemical composition ( renzini & buzzoni 1986 ) .",
    "this traditional paradigm remains still valid to a certain extent , although a wealth of recent results showed that gcs are not as simple as previously thought , harboring multiple stellar populations ( mps ) .",
    "indeed star - to - star variations of light elements have been known for decades ( see for example cohen 1978 ) , but this evidence was limited to a small number of stars in each cluster and was still compatible with a pure evolutionary effect ( mixing ) . only in the last years , intense and extended spectroscopic campaigns of large samples of stars in any evolutionary stage , have established , with a high degree of confidence , that all gcs show primordial star - to - star variations in c , n , o , na , mg and al , and a strict homogeneity in the iron abundance centauri ( see for example johnson et al .",
    "2010 and references therein ) and terzan  5 ( ferraro et al . 2009 ; origlia et al .",
    "additional clusters with a measurable spread in [ fe / h ] , confirmed with high resolution spectroscopy , are m  54 ( carretta et al .",
    "2010a ) , m  22 ( marino et al . 2011 ) and m  2 ( yong et al . 2014 ) . ]",
    "( gratton , sneden & carretta 2004 ; carretta et al .",
    "such chemical inhomegeneities produce a variety of features in the color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) as highlighted by high quality photometry in appropriate filters .",
    "for example , main sequence splittings , as those observed in @xmath1  centauri ( bedin et al .",
    "2004 ) , ngc  2808 ( piotto et al . 2007 ) and ngc  6752 ( milone et al .",
    "2010 ) , are thought to be originated by large spreads in the he abundance , while sub giant branch ( sgb ) splittings can be driven by differences in the c+n+o abundances ( e.g. milone et al .",
    "2008 ; cassisi et al .",
    "however , the most ubiquitous photometric tracer of multiple populations is the color spread and/or the multi - modality in red giant branches ( rgbs ) with near - uv filters ( nuv ; see for example marino et al .",
    "2008 ; lardo et al .",
    "2011 ; monelli et al .",
    "2013 ) . in these cmds , stars enriched in c and n all lie on the red side of the rgb , while stars with pristine abundance of these elements lie on the blue side .",
    "this effect is driven by the relative strength of deep cn and nh features in the range 3000@xmath24000   of the rgb spectra , as conclusively demonstrated by sbordone et al .",
    "thanks to this property , mps have been identified in a good number of clusters so far , even by using ground - based photometry ( see for example monelli et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "it is now commonly accepted that the cn - weak , na - poor ( hereafter , na - poor ) population is associated to a first generation ( fg ) of stars and the cn - strong , na - rich ( na - rich ) to a second generation ( sg ) formed during the first few @xmath3 100 myr of the cluster life , from intra - cluster medium polluted by the fg stars ( dercole et al .",
    "2008 ; carretta et al . 2009 ; see , however , bastian et al .",
    "2013 for a model that does not require multiple episodes of star formation ) .",
    "intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch stars ( im - agbs : ventura & dantona 2008 ) , fast rotating massive stars ( frmss ; decressin et al . 2007 ) , massive binary stars ( de mink et al .",
    "2009 ) have been proposed as the most likely polluters of the primordial intra - cluster medium , enhancing na , al and he and depleting mg and o , while leaving the iron abundance unaffected .",
    "however , all formation models face serious problems and we are still far from a full understanding of the processes responsible for the presence of mps in gcs ( see , e.g. , renzini , 2008 ) .    dercole et al .",
    "( 2008 ) performed hydrodynamical and n - body simulations to explore the formation of mps in the scenario of im - agbs polluters .",
    "in their analysis , agb ejecta form a cooling flow that rapidly collects in the innermost regions of the cluster , forming a concentrated sg stellar subsystem ( see also bekki 2011 ) .",
    "their models predict also that , in the early evolutionary phases , the cluster looses a significant fraction of its original mass .",
    "indeed the early explosions of snii lead to a strong and preferential loss of fg stars , resulting in a cluster with a similar number of first and second generation stars ( dercole et al .",
    "for comparison we refer the reader to the constraints on the mass - loss budget of gcs in dwarf galaxies obtained by larsen et al .",
    "( 2014 and reference therein ) .",
    "after the early loss of fg stars , the system eventually starts its long - term dynamical evolution driven by two - body relaxation .",
    "understanding the dynamics and the characteristic time - scales over which mps retain memory of their primordial distribution is crucial to properly constrain the models and get new precious insight on gc formation and evolution .",
    "in all cases where the radial distribution has been analyzed , the na - rich population has been invariably found to be more concentrated than its na - poor counterpart ( see e.g. bellini et al .",

    "in this work we extend such kind of studies to the low - mass gc ngc  6362 . by means of a proper combination of high resolution hubble space telescope ( hst ) and ground based optical and nuv data , we revealed the presence of multiple sequences along the sgb and rgb of this cluster .",

    "images were collected in three bands : @xmath5@xmath6 ( hereafter u ) , @xmath7@xmath8 ( b ) and @xmath9@xmath10 ( v ) .",
    "the analysis has been performed following the same approach used for the hst data .",
    "we reported the @xmath11 and @xmath12 instrumental magnitude to the vegamag photometric system by using the stars in common with hsta and hstb .",
    "the b magnitudes were reported instead to the standard johnson photometric system by using photometric standards .            both the _ high - resolution _ and _ wide - field _ data - sets have been put on the absolute astrometric system ( dalessandro et al .",

    "in figure  1 ( panel a ) we show a zoom of the @xmath13 ) cmd of ngc  6362 .",
    "all the main evolutionary sequences ( ms , sgb and rgb ) are well defined and their typical width is fully compatible with photometric errors .",
    "conversely , in the @xmath14 ) cmd ( figure 1 , panel b ) the sgb and the rgb broaden or clearly split . in particular , starting from the turnoff it is possible to distinguish two sequences and follow them at different magnitude levels .",
    "we have verified that such a behavior can not be due to differential reddening ( dalessandro et al .",
    "2014b , in preparation ) .",
    "we determined a fiducial line for the observed @xmath14 ) cmd .",
    "as shown in figure  2 , the distance of the stars from this fiducial line , in the @xmath15 ) color for the rgb and the @xmath16 ) magnitude for the sgb , is clearly bimodal .",
    "we used these distributions to select the red and blue sub - populations .",
    "as expected , the two populations are perfectly superimposed one to the other in the @xmath13 ) plane ( see panel a in figure  1 ) .",
    "instead , the separation in two well distinct sub - populations remains robust in all cmds where the f336w filter is used ( see figure  3 ) .    according to combined spectro - photometric works",
    "( see for example marino et al .",
    "2008 ) , the red sequence is expected to be populated by na - rich stars , while the blue one is made of na - poor stars , which should trace the primordial abundances of the clusters ( hence , the first generation ) . in figure  1 ( panels c and d )",
    "we show two 12 gyr isochrones of metallicity similar to that of ngc  6362 ( [ fe / h]@xmath17 ; harris 1996 , 2010 edition ) and with different light - element mixtures ( sbordone et al .",
    "clearly the behavior observed for ngc  6362 at both the sgb and rgb levels in both the cmds is qualitatively reproduced by theoretical models .    in the wfi sample",
    "the same behavior emerges : in the ( @xmath18 ) plane , stars define narrow sequences whereas in the ( @xmath19 ) cmd both the sgb and rgb split or broaden more than expected from photometric errors ( figure  4 ) .",
    "of course the poorer photometric accuracy and the galactic field contamination make the distinction of the two populations less clear than in the _ high - resolution _ sample .",
    "hence , in order to study the radial distribution of the fg and sg stars , in both the hst and the wfi samples , we considered only objects along the rgb in the magnitude interval @xmath20 in the ( @xmath21 ) cmd ( figure  4 ) .",
    "in figure  5 ( upper panel ) we show the cumulative radial distribution of fg and sg stars from the center to the tidal radius ( @xmath22 , corresponding to @xmath23 at the adopted distance @xmath24  harris 1996 ) . clearly , the radial distributions of the two populations do not show any significant difference . according to the k - s test",
    ", the probability that the two samples are not extracted from the same parent population is @xmath25 , well below the standard threshold of @xmath26 .",
    "the same behavior is confirmed also when the _ high - resolution _ and _ wide field _",
    "samples are analyzed separately .",
    "we have also analyzed the radial trend of the ratio between the number of sg and fg stars ( @xmath27 ) as a function of the distance from the cluster center .",
    "we divided the field of view covered by our data - base in five concentric annuli .",
    "as shown in figure  5 ( lower panel ) , a flat behavior around @xmath28 all over the cluster extension is observed .",
    "we have carefully checked that these results are robust to meaningful variations in the selection of the two populations .",
    "_ this is the first evidence ever collected of two sub - populations in a gc sharing the same radial distribution all over the cluster extension . _ ) .",
    "however sg stars appear significantly more centrally concentrated than fg ones when the analysis is extended to larger distances ( kravtsov et al .",
    "2011 ) . on the other hand , lardo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) were unable to find difference in the radial distribution of the various populations in the two most distant clusters of their sample , because the quality of the available data were clearly insufficient for this purpose ( see beccari et al .",
    "the observational evidence presented in this work demonstrates that the mps in ngc  6362 are fully spatially mixed .",
    "recently , vesperini et al .",
    "( 2013 ) analyzed by means of n - body simulations , the long - term evolution of mps in gcs as driven by two - body relaxation .",
    "the initial conditions of their simulations are clusters with almost the same number of fg and sg stars , with the latter being more centrally concentrated than the former from their birth ( dercole et al .",
    "these systems have already experienced intra - cluster enrichment ( dercole et al .",
    "2008 ) and have already lost mass ( preferentially in the form of fg stars ) as a result of the expansion triggered by snii explosions . following the dynamical evolution of all their simulations ,",
    "the authors find that the difference in the radial distribution of the two populations is progressively wiped out starting from the cluster center and enclosing larger and larger portions of the cluster as dynamical evolution proceeds and the mass lost budget , due to dynamical effects , becomes significant . in particular , the simulations by vesperini et al .",
    "( 2013 ) show that complete mixing is expected in advanced dynamical evolutionary stages , after @xmath29 ( the actual timescale depending on the initial conditions and in particular on the initial concentration of sg stars ) , for clusters that lost at least @xmath30 of their mass during the long term dynamical evolution , regardless of the assumed mp formation scenario . to this amount of mass lost , in the context in which mps form through multiple star formation episodes ( decressin et al . 2007 ; ventura & dantona 2008 ; dercole et al .",
    "2008 ) , it should be added the expected @xmath31 of primordial mass loss during the early and somehow violent evolution ( @xmath32 gyr ) , mainly driven by snii explosions ( dercole et al .",
    "therefore we can argue that , in this framework , the present mass of ngc  6362 should be @xmath33 of its original value .    from the collected data , we estimated the half mass radius @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) of ngc  6362 .",
    "we also derived its present relaxation time at @xmath36 to be @xmath37 gyr corresponding to about 1/7 of the cluster age ( @xmath38 gyr ; dotter et al .",
    "these values are not peculiar in any respects , being fully comparable with those found in other galactic gcs ( see for example harris 1996 , 2010 edition ) still showing clear radial trends among mps .",
    "@xmath39 is actually slightly larger than the average for galactic gcs .",
    "this would suggest that ngc  6362 had a dynamical history significantly different from other ggcs with similar present - day properties , leading to a larger amount of mass loss .    by using the best - fit king model reproducing the density profile and the velocity dispersion data by pryor & meylan ( 1993 )",
    ", we have estimated that the present day total mass of ngc  6362 is @xmath40 .",
    "this is about 2 - 3 times smaller than what we estimated , by using the same approach , for two other small gcs , ngc  288 and m  4 , for which spectroscopic and photometric evidence of mps have been obtained ( for comparison see also the estimates by mclaughlin & van der marel 2005 and sollima et al .",
    "_ ngc  6362 might be the least massive cluster where mps have been found so far_. this is an important result , which needs to be confirmed with a more accurate velocity dispersion measure , which is indeed the main source of uncertainties at this stage .",
    "this finding would help to constrain the conditions for the onset of light - element self - enrichment in star clusters ( carretta et al .",
    "the original mass of ngc  6362 should be fixed around some @xmath41 in the mp formation scenarios proposed by dercole et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and decressin et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , or @xmath42 in the framework suggested by de mink et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and bastian et al .",
    "these quantities are in any case smaller than the expected average primordial mass of galactic gcs . in this context , it is also worth noting that the original mass of ngc  6362 is comparable , or even smaller , than what estimated for many young clusters in nearby galaxies , where no observational evidence compatible with multiple star formation episodes has been revealed ( see for example cabrera - ziri et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "an high - eccentricity orbit leading ngc  6362 to several passages close to the mw center and through the galactic disk , would have favored the loss of a large fraction of its original mass in addition to that lost for two - body relaxation .",
    "indeed , ngc  6362 has a quite shallow present day mass function ( paust et al .",
    "2010 ) , which can be indicative of a large amount of mass lost due to tidal effects ( webb et al .",
    "in addition , allen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) estimated a tidal destruction time of about 10 gyr for this cluster ( and an average eccentricity @xmath43 ) , by adopting a mass about two times larger than the one obtained here .",
    "the use of our mass estimate would result in one of the shortest tidal destruction times of the author s sample .",
    "however , from our data , we are not able to find neither significant deviations from sphericity in the spatial distribution of stars , or breaks in the surface density profile that could suggest the occurrence of tidal disturbances ( dalessandro et al . 2014b , in preparation ) .",
    "another possibility is that the two populations had similar distributions from the start .",
    "however this explanation would hardly fit in any of the present mp formation scenarios ( ventura & dantona 2008 ; decressin et al .",
    "2007 ; de mink et al . 2009",
    "; bastian et al . 2013 ) .     as a function of the distance from the cluster center",
    ". for the _ high - resolution _ sample proper - motion selected stars have been counted , while for the _ wide - field _ sample a statistical decontamination from galactic field objects has been adopted .",
    "a flat distribution around @xmath44 is observed.,width=302 ]    indeed high - resolution spectroscopic data for a large sample of stars in this cluster is urged .",
    "in fact , this would allow to fully characterize the chemical and kinematical patterns of the stellar populations of ngc  6362 .",
    "on the other hand , a proper combination with ad - hoc n - body simulations is required to unveil the dynamical and star formation history of this intriguing system .",
