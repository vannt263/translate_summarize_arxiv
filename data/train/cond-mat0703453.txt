    "the dynamics of electron spins in semiconductor structures , such as quantum dots ( qds ) , has attracted much attention due to both its fundamental importance , as well as the potential applications in spin - based quantum information processing : not only does the electron spin degrees of freedom provide a natural two - level system with long energy relaxation time @xcite , but semiconductor - based quantum computing architectures can benefit from well - developed technology and a high degree of scalability @xcite .",
    "practical exploitation of such a potential , however , is severely hindered by the loss of phase coherence caused by the unavoidable coupling between the electron spin and its surrounding environment . for typical qd operating conditions and geometry , decoherence mechanisms associated with phonon processes or magnetic spin - orbit interactions are effectively suppressed , leaving the hyperfine coupling with nuclear spins as the dominant decoherence channel .",
    "the resulting decoherence dynamics occurs very rapidly , with the coherence times from ensemble measurements ( @xmath0 ) being of the order of tens of nanoseconds for typical gaas qds at experimentally relevant ( sub - kelvin ) temperatures and moderate ( sub - tesla ) magnetic fields @xcite .    as a result ,",
    "viable methods for decoherence suppression are of key relevance .",
    "a number of proposals have been put forward for increasing the coherence time , for instance by seeking a high degree of nuclear spin polarization @xcite , by narrowing the nuclear spin distribution @xcite , or by cleverly disentangling the bath from the electron spin via external control @xcite . however ,",
    "these methods remain challenging to implement by current or near - term capabilities , and alternative approaches are still actively sought .    in this context",
    ", a promising approach is offered by dynamical decoupling ( dd ) methods @xcite .",
    "borrowing their inspiration from coherent averaging techniques in high - resolution nmr spectroscopy @xcite , dd schemes aim at removing the effect of environmental coupling by subjecting the electron spin to suitably tailored sequences of control pulses .",
    "the long correlation time and distinctively non - markovian behavior of the nuclear spin reservoir make the dd approach naturally suited for electron spin coherence control in qds , as demonstrated by the recent implementation of single - pulse hahn echo experiments @xcite , which succeeded at extending @xmath1 by two orders of magnitude .",
    "thus , it is both timely and important to undertake a comprehensive theoretical study of performance of multi - pulse dd protocols , in order to assess relative strengths and weaknesses , and identify optimal schemes .",
    "only a few protocols have been quantitatively analyzed so far .",
    "in addition , the majority of investigations have focused on the case of qds subjected to strong magnetic fields , predicting a coherence enhancement of at least an order of magnitude in gaas qds @xcite . still , the experimentally important situation of low - to - moderate fields is significantly more difficult to analyze due to the competition between purely adiabatic ( energy - conserving ) decoherence and relaxation processes .",
    "existing studies have mostly relied on restrictive approximations  in particular , semi - classical treatments @xcite or magnus expansion ( me ) techniques @xcite .",
    "thus , little is known about the actual performance of dd protocols in a variety of practically important regimes .",
    "our goal in this paper is to further push a quantitative analysis of the electron spin decoherence problem in regimes which are relevant for experimental dd implementations in qds , yet have received marginal consideration so far  @xcite .",
    "special attention is devoted to the limit of zero external field , where dephasing and relaxation must be simultaneously eliminated , and the asymptotic long - time limit , where the effects of finite control rate and coherent error accumulation are crucial , so that neither the me nor the standard quasi - static approximation for the nuclear spin bath are reliable a priori .",
    "the content is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] provides the essential background on the qd model hamiltonian and various dd protocols .",
    "section  [ sec : res ] summarizes both the relevant steps of the methodology used to tackle the problem , and presents a comparative analysis of all the dd protocols under investigation .",
    "a detailed discussion of the best dd protocol based on periodic concatenated design is presented , including the effects of control pulse delay , level of concatenation , intra - bath dipolar interaction , and coupling spectrum .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "the dynamics of an electron spin @xmath2 coupled to a bath @xmath3 of @xmath4 nuclear spins in a qd is described by a total hamiltonian of the form @xmath5 here , @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the electron and the @xmath8-th bath spin operators , respectively ; @xmath9 is the electron zeeman energy in an external magnetic field @xmath10 ; @xmath11 gives the hyperfine contact interaction between the electron spin and the nuclei ; and @xmath12 corresponds to the intra - bath dipolar coupling between nuclear spins @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 determine the strength of the respective interactions . in particular , the coupling energy per nucleus @xmath13 depends on the electron probability density at the nucleus location .",
    "we focus on the limit of zero external field @xmath15 , so that all directions are equally affected by decoherence , and choose @xmath16 , since the analysis does not depend qualitatively on the specific spin value ( up to an appropriate renormalization of the parameters ) .",
    "the zeeman energies of the nuclear spins and the anisotropy of the hyperfine coupling are very small and can be neglected for the time scales we are interested in . the bath is assumed to be initially unpolarized , which is justified by the fact that in typical experiments the temperature is much larger than the characteristic energy of nuclear spins .    in the absence of control pulses , the electron spin described by the above hamiltonian undergoes free induction decay ( fid ) on a time scale given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is approximately @xmath19ev for typical gaas qds with @xmath20 @xcite . in our analysis , we set @xmath21 , and measure frequency and energy in units of @xmath22 , with time correspondingly being given in units of @xmath23 .    in order to slow down the decoherence process ,",
    "we recur to dd methods .",
    "the basic idea consists of modifying the system dynamics by subjecting the electron spin to a sequence of @xmath24 pulses , where @xmath25 denotes the control axis . in the simplest",
    "setting , the pulses are equally separated by an interval @xmath26 , during which the system evolves freely .",
    "we assume _ bang - bang controls _ , that is , arbitrarily strong and instantaneous pulses , which we draw from a control group @xmath27 , @xmath28 , according to @xmath29 . for a single spin as relevant here ,",
    "the sequences are derived from the irreducible pauli group @xmath30 @xcite , where @xmath31 are the identity and the pauli matrices of the electron spin , respectively .",
    "a variety of control protocols have been developed , which exploit deterministic @xcite and stochastic @xcite design . in _ cyclic _",
    "dd methods , the pulse sequence is fixed , pre - determined , and periodically repeated in time ; in _ randomized _ dd , the future control actions are not known in advance , but chosen at random from a set of alternatives .",
    "the construction of deterministic dd sequences has been mainly based on the average hamiltonian theory @xcite , having as a goal the cancellation of the dominant terms in the me series for the underlying time evolution operator .",
    "the simplest periodic dd ( pdd ) sequence we consider here ensures the removal of the zeroth order term @xmath32 of the average hamiltonian @xmath33 at every @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the cycle time , and @xmath37 is the size of the dd group . by fixing the path of @xmath38 as @xmath39 ,",
    "the control sequence becomes @xmath40 , where @xmath41 denotes the interval of free evolution .",
    "thus , the cycle propagator for a system subjected to the pdd sequence is given by @xmath42 ds \\right\\ } & \\equiv & \\exp\\left[-i \\overline{\\cal h } t_c \\right ] = \\exp\\left[-i ( \\overline{\\cal h}^{(0 ) } + \\overline{\\cal h}^{(1 ) } + \\cdots ) t_c\\right ] \\label{physical } \\\\",
    "\\nonumber & = & zu_0xu_0zu_0xu_0\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 indicates time ordering , @xmath44 corresponds to the applied control hamiltonian , @xmath45 is the free propagator , and the zeroth order term in the me is @xmath46 = h_b\\,,\\ ] ] that is , terms coupling the system and bath degrees of freedom are removed to lowest order .",
    "the terms depending on @xmath11 appear in the higher - order corrections , in particular @xmath47 , which guarantees dd between the system and the bath in the limit of arbitrarily fast control , @xmath48 . clearly , @xmath26 is necessarily finite in realistic settings , its minimum value being constrained by practical limitations ( e.g. , for qds and other devices operating at dilution refrigerator temperatures , the need to avoid excessive radio - frequency heating of the sample , which imposes limitation on the total absorbed power ) . in order to improve dd performance , going beyond what is achievable by the first - order schemes above , two main strategies are available : higher - order dd , ensuring cancellation of higher order terms in the effective hamiltonian ; and reduction of error accumulation in time due to the remaining terms of the hamiltonian .    as prototypes of higher - level deterministic sequences , we consider symmetric dd ( sdd ) and concatenated dd ( cdd )  @xcite .",
    "the sdd sequence corresponds to a symmetrization of @xmath49 , being written as @xmath50 .",
    "its cycle time is twice as long as pdd , but at every @xmath51 , besides @xmath52 , all odd terms in @xmath53 are also canceled , leading to @xmath54 .",
    "cdd relies on a temporal recursive structure , so that at level @xmath55 the pulse sequence is given by @xmath56 . here",
    ", we _ truncate _ the concatenation procedure at a certain level and repeat a periodic sequence , referred to as pcdd@xmath57 , after every @xmath58 .",
    "for example , @xmath59 leads to pcdd@xmath60 , which is also a symmetric protocol , although usually superior than sdd at reducing error accumulation .",
    "the main goal of stochastic protocols is to guarantee that errors accumulate probabilistically in time , instead of coherently as in deterministic sequences . as representatives of these methods",
    ", we consider naive random dd ( nrd ) , random path dd ( rpd ) , and symmetrized random path dd ( srpd ) .",
    "nrd corresponds to a sequence of pulses chosen randomly from @xmath38 with equal probability . for rpd",
    ", randomization is associated with the path to traverse the group @xmath38 , that is , at every @xmath61 one chooses at random one of the following options : \\{@xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67}. srpd improves over rpd by symmetrizing the random paths as in sdd and inserting a random pulse between paths . besides slowing down the error accumulation at long times , rpd and srpd",
    "also ensure good performance at short times , since they lead to effective hamiltonians @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "note that for randomized dd the periodicity , as well as the notion of a control cycle , is lost in general .",
    "thus , the comparison between deterministic and randomized protocols is most naturally carried out in the so - called logical frame . in this frame , @xmath44 is removed from the evolution through the transformation @xmath70 , where tilde indicates logical frame , @xmath71 $ ] corresponds to the control propagator , and @xmath72 is the propagator in the physical frame , as given by eq .",
    "( [ physical ] ) . for deterministic sequences ,",
    "both physical and logical propagators stroboscopically coincide at the completion of each cycle , but the same is not necessarily true for the stochastic methods . in the latter case , in order to return the state of the system to the physical frame , it suffices to keep track of the applied control pulses .",
    "to compare the above - mentioned control protocols in a way which avoids dependence on the initial state of the systems , @xmath73 , we shall consider the worst - case scenario and compute the minimum input - output pure - state fidelity , @xmath74,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 corresponds to the reduced density matrix of the electron spin at time @xmath76 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath77 may be thought of as the minimum state overlap between the intended and the decoupled system evolution .",
    "analytical bounds on the worst - case pure - state expected fidelity have been established for various dd protocols  @xcite , however they apply only to short evolution times and small pulse separations .",
    "numerical simulations are mandatory to investigate dd performance at long times and for a broad range of @xmath26 values .",
    "we are especially interested in pulse delays beyond the restricted domain where the me is _ guaranteed _ to converge , @xmath78 , where @xmath79 denotes a high frequency cutoff . while in most situations @xmath79",
    "is determined by @xmath12 , for the qd problem the nuclear spin bath is to a very high accuracy _ non - dynamical _ , thus @xmath79 is determined by the electron - nuclear coupling hamiltonian @xmath11 .",
    "this leads to @xmath80 , which is very large for typical qds .",
    "we will consider @xmath81 , where @xmath82 represents the power spectrum width of the entire system , with @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "thus , the basic cycle time @xmath84 will be _ up to a factor @xmath85 longer _ than the formal ( worst - case ) convergence requirement of the me .",
    "we shall also assume that @xmath86 are uniformly distributed random numbers .",
    "the minimum fidelity is numerically obtained by employing the quantum process tomography method  @xcite as follows .",
    "the initial state of the entire system is taken as a direct product of the electron spin state @xmath87 and the bath spin state @xmath88 .",
    "four different @xmath87 are considered : @xmath89 , and @xmath90 ; while a single @xmath88 is assumed , corresponding to a random superposition @xmath91 of all possible tensor products of the form @xmath92 , where @xmath93 are uniform random numbers .",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation for the joint system plus bath dynamics is then solved by applying the chebyshev polynomial expansion method to the evolution operator @xcite . at final time @xmath76",
    ", a partial trace over the bath is performed , and the four resulting reduced density matrices are used to compute the @xmath94 @xmath95-matrix  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath95-matrix is a superoperator that describes the effective dynamics of the electron spin and allows for the reduced density matrix of an arbitrary electron initial state to be evaluated from the equation @xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 . since an arbitrary initial state of @xmath2 in the bloch sphere",
    "may be expressed as @xmath101 , @xmath102 $ ] , @xmath103 $ ] , @xmath77 simplifies to @xmath104 in practice , after determining the matrix @xmath95 , we obtain @xmath77 from numerical minimization , by comparing the results over a statistically meaningful set of initial guesses for @xmath105 , and then selecting the worst case .",
    "[ fig : cp](a ) shows @xmath77 for the above - mentioned dd protocols . for comparison , we plot also the fid signal , for which no control is applied .",
    "because the characteristic time scale @xmath106 for the nuclear dipolar dynamics ( resulting from @xmath12 ) is at least two orders of magnitude slower than the one due to @xmath11 in typical qds , setting @xmath107 is justified over the time scales studied here .",
    "as seen , all schemes lead to substantial enhancement of the electron spin coherence , provided that the control time scale is sufficiently fast compared to an _ effective upper cutoff _ determined by the spectral width @xmath108 .",
    "similar to the behavior observed for dd of @xmath109 noise @xcite , this indicates how general convergence arguments may place too stringent a bound for realistic systems , actual performance depending sensitively on spectral details .    among the various protocols , nrd shows ( not surprisingly ) the worst performance , consistent with the expectation that its advantages over deterministic dd appear only when the control group is very large .",
    "pdd and sdd are , respectively , outperformed by rpd and srpd , confirming the reduction of error accumulation associated with randomization .",
    "interestingly , the rpd protocol provides worse fidelity than sdd at times smaller than @xmath110 , but eventually also outperforms sdd at longer times .",
    "the best performance for this system , however , is achieved by the deterministic pcdd@xmath60 .",
    "compared with the case of closed systems under the action of reducible control groups investigated in  @xcite , this confirms how concatenated design is especially efficient for irreducible averaging .",
    "a feature which also proves beneficial for concatenation is the absence of internal bath dynamics  @xcite .    , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "( a ) comparison of various protocols with @xmath113 . for nrd and fid ,",
    "data points are acquired after every @xmath26 , for deterministic dd ( pdd , sdd , pcdd@xmath60 ) , right at the completion of each cycle , while for rpd and srpd this is done after every @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively .",

    "2(a ) , by focusing on the time @xmath125 where the protocol attains @xmath130 for given @xmath26 .",
    "two main features are observed : ( i ) @xmath125 increases monotonically as @xmath26 decreases  consistent with the fact that no crossover from decoherence suppression to decoherence acceleration is expected as long as @xmath26 is sufficiently small with respect to the inverse spectral width of the environmental coupling @xcite .",
    "that is , in terms of the formal analogy established between decoherence control methods based on dd pulses and frequent quantum measurements  @xcite , only the counterpart of quantum zeno effect ( qze ) is observed in the relevant parameter regime , with no occurrence of `` anti - zeno '' behavior ; ( ii ) the pccd@xmath60 performance depends quite sensitively on @xmath26 , moderate changes in the value of @xmath26 ( say , by a factor of two ) changing the coherence time @xmath125 by up to three orders of magnitude . for pcdd@xmath60 , the leading non - zero term in the me is @xmath131 , so that the error amplitude per cycle is bounded by @xmath132 , and therefore the total error amplitude after a number @xmath133 of cycles grows as @xmath134 . as a result ,",
    "within the regime of validity of the me , the time @xmath125 at which the total error probability @xmath135 reaches @xmath136 is expected to increase as @xmath137 with decreasing @xmath26 . the steeper dependence shown by the data in fig .",
    "2(a ) indicates that a naive extrapolation of the above estimate in the long - time regime of relevance is not directly viable .",
    "finally , we investigate the effect of interaction between the bath spins , taking the intra - bath coupling parameters @xmath14 in ( [ eq : h ] ) as uniformly distributed random numbers in @xmath138 $ ] , and assuming that the bath spins are located on a @xmath139 piece of a two - dimension square lattice .",
    "one may expect that the effect of intra - bath coupling becomes important once the characteristic coupling strength @xmath140 is comparable with the system - bath coupling @xmath22 .",
    "however , figs .",
    "[ fig : dip](b ) and ( c ) show that the effect of intra - bath interactions becomes clearly visible already for much smaller values of @xmath141 , leading to a decrease of the coherence time @xmath125 by an order of magnitude in comparison with the case @xmath111 .",
    "although the fast bath dynamics regime is not directly relevant to standard gaas qds , where @xmath142 , our observations may be useful as a first step towards characterization of dd in other systems .",
    "additional physical insight into the performance of dd schemes may be gained by considering the coupling spectrum of the qd hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) in the absence and in the presence of control . a typical spectrum for uniformly distributed random @xmath13 ( obtained numerically )",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum](a ) . for the homogeneous case of constant @xmath143 ( below",
    ", we set @xmath144 for convenience ) , the spectrum may be evaluated analytically , the result being also shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : spectrum](a ) .",
    "physically , the limit @xmath143 is equivalent to a semiclassical treatment of the bath , where the quantum - mechanical operator @xmath145 , representing the overhauser field exerted by the bath on the electron spin , is approximated by a randomly oriented classical vector @xmath146 with zero mean and variance @xmath82 @xcite .    for @xmath143 ,",
    "the operator of the total bath spin @xmath147 is an integral of motion , and the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) acquires a simple form of two coupled spins , @xmath148 where @xmath149 .",
    "let us consider a state of the whole system @xmath150 , which corresponds to the electron spin up , and the bath having total spin @xmath151 with @xmath152-projection equal to @xmath153 .",
    "since the value of @xmath154 is also an integral of motion , this state is coupled only to one state , @xmath155 .",
    "thus , the total hamiltonian matrix can be separated into a number of uncoupled @xmath156 blocks , each block involving a pair of levels @xmath150 and @xmath157 .",
    "correspondingly , the whole system can be viewed as a collection of uncoupled two - level systems , with state space spanned by basis states @xmath150 and @xmath157 .",
    "the energy splitting between these basis states , @xmath158 , is determined by the diagonal part of the hamiltonian ( [ h2s ] ) , @xmath159 , whereas the coupling matrix element between the basis states is determined by the non - diagonal part @xmath160 .",
    "the coupling spectrum @xmath161 quantifies the density of bath states weighted by the corresponding coupling strength .",
    "the spectral density @xmath162 of two - level systems having energy splitting @xmath163 may be computed by a combinatorial argument : this is the density of the bath states having a given value of @xmath153 ( since @xmath164 for @xmath165 ) , which leads to @xmath166 the modulus square of the matrix element @xmath167 which couples the basis states @xmath150 and @xmath157 is @xmath168 , and it should be averaged over all two - level systems having the same @xmath153 ( i.e. , the same @xmath169 ) but different values of @xmath151 .",

( [ g ] )",
    "further demonstrates why the anti - zeno - like behavior ( acceleration of decoherence by dd pulses ) is not observed in our simulations : @xmath161 monotonically decreases with @xmath169 , and even for large @xmath36 the total power of the modified coupling spectrum can not increase .",
    "since , as noted , our results for @xmath112 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 ( fig .",
    "2(a ) ) are very close to each other , we expect that the basic qualitative features of our analysis remain applicable to realistic situations with large @xmath4 .",
    "we have characterized quantitatively the performance of various dd protocols for an electron spin coupled to a nuclear spin bath , including both standard cyclic and randomized dd design .",
    "two main points emerge from our analysis : on one hand , dd methods demonstrate a clear potential for significantly enhancing the electron spin coherence time for an _ arbitrary initial state _ , actual performance depending on both control and physical parameters .",
    "in particular , the frequency spectrum of the environmental coupling proves fundamental for identifying the _ minimum _ time scale requirements that must be met in order for dd to be effective . on the other hand",

    "<S> the dominant source of decoherence for an electron spin in a quantum dot is the hyperfine interaction with the surrounding bath of nuclear spins . </S>",
    "<S> the decoherence process may be slowed down by subjecting the electron spin to suitable sequences of external control pulses . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the performance of a variety of dynamical decoupling protocols using exact numerical simulation . </S>",
    "<S> emphasis is given to realistic pulse delays and the long - time limit , beyond the domain where available analytical approaches are guaranteed to work . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that both deterministic and randomized protocols are capable to significantly prolong the electron coherence time , even when using control pulse separations substantially larger than what expected from the _ upper cutoff _ frequency of the coupling spectrum between the electron and the nuclear spins . in a realistic parameter range , </S>",
    "<S> the _ total width _ of such a coupling spectrum appears to be the physically relevant frequency scale affecting the overall quality of the decoupling . </S>"
