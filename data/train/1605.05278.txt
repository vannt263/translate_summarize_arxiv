    "bivariate time series are commonly represented as complex - valued signals in numerous applications including wireless communication @xcite , meteorology and oceanography @xcite , and functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) @xcite .",
    "there have been important methodological developments in machine learning and signal processing for complex - valued signals , see e.g. the books by @xcite .",
    "there is a growing interest in analyzing complex - valued processes that are said to be _ improper _ ( see e.g. @xcite ) , as opposed to _ proper _ , concepts which we define formally in this paper .",
    "improper processes are sometimes referred to as noncircular processes , and proper processes as circular processes @xcite .",
    "a proper process can be interpreted as a second order process whose statistics are rotationally invariant when viewed in the complex plane , whereas improper processes are not , and the latter are seen to be more realistic models for applications ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1.9 ) .",
    "numerous improper complex - valued stochastic models have been proposed , e.g. @xcite , for applications including climate and seismology , and in this paper we provide an algorithm for their efficient simulation .    for efficiently simulating gaussian processes , the technique of circulant embedding @xcite is receiving increasing attention .",
    "the underlying concept is that the covariance matrix of any regularly sampled stationary process is toeplitz , and hence can be embedded into a larger matrix that is _ circulant_.",
    "a circulant matrix has the useful property that the matrix can be diagonalized via fourier transforms , such that gaussian sequences can be simulated in @xmath2 operations , where @xmath1 is the length of the desired sequence .",
    "this is faster than the alternative method of cholesky factorization which requires @xmath3 operations .",
    "the circulant embedding technique is exact , in that the simulated sequence has statistical properties that exactly match the model , there are however instances where exactness is not guaranteed , which has been the subject of further investigation , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the method of circulant embedding was extended to simulating complex - valued processes in @xcite .",
    "this procedure is only applicable to proper processes however . in this paper",
    "we extend the method to improper processes by incorporating techniques developed in @xcite for multivariate processes .",
    "this connection was also recently mentioned in @xcite , although this paper primarily focuses on revisiting the problem of simulating proper processes .",
    "the contribution of our paper is to provide full details of the @xmath0 generating algorithm for improper processes , together with a practical example , and an empirical evaluation of its performance .    for improper processes modeled in the _ frequency _ domain ,",
    "an exact simulation algorithm is provided in @xcite . here in this paper",
    "we detail an exact simulation algorithm for improper processes specified in the _ time _",
    "domain by their covariance structure .",
    "the distinction is important , because processes specified analytically in one domain can not in general be expressed analytically in the other . therefore converting from one domain to",
    "the other often requires an approximation , thus losing the exactness of the procedure ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.4 ) ) .",
    "we also note approximate techniques for simulating improper processes in @xcite using widely - linear filters @xcite .",
    "circulant embedding , on the other hand , can be used to exactly generate finite sequences from infinite - order non - markovian gaussian processes , as we shall demonstrate in this paper .",
    "consider a complex - valued stationary gaussian process defined by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 .",
    "we assume without loss of generality , that @xmath6 is zero mean , as a non - zero mean can be added to the simulated sequence _ a posteriori_.    the process @xmath6 is fully specified by the autocovariances and cross covariances of @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , given by @xmath9 for all @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the expectation operator .",
    "we note that @xmath12 and @xmath13 , but in general @xmath14 .",
    "equivalently , the process @xmath6 can be fully specified by its own autocovariance and _ complementary _ covariance sequence , specified respectively by @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath6 .",
    "the sequences @xmath17 and @xmath18 are in general complex - valued and have the properties that @xmath19 ( hermitian symmetry ) and @xmath20 ( symmetry ) .",
    "the sequence @xmath18 is sometimes also referred to as the relation sequence @xcite , or the pseudo - covariance @xcite .",
    "complex - valued processes that have the property that @xmath21 for all @xmath22 are said to be _ proper _ , and are otherwise said to be _ improper _ @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the improper case where @xmath23 .",

    ", a potentially problematic aspect of implementing circulant embedding algorithms is that the eigenvalues @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( in algorithm  [ mainalgorithm ] , line 9 ) are not guaranteed to be nonnegative definite .",
    "negative eigenvalues occur when the circulant matrices ( in algorithm  [ mainalgorithm ] , line 67 ) are not nonnegative definite , and are hence invalid covariance matrices .",

    "first we define the @xmath80 covariance matrix @xmath97 for all @xmath10 .",
    "the first scenario is when the matrices @xmath98 are absolutely summable , and the corresponding spectral density matrix is positive definite . then the method is exact for large enough @xmath96 .",

    "@xmath98 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 , are nonnegative definite for @xmath103 .    at first glance",
    "these conditions appear hard to interpret , but intuition can be developed by looking in the complex domain . by examining",
    " we can see that time - reversibility follows when @xmath104 for all @xmath22 .",
    "then if we also have that @xmath105 , it follows that @xmath98 is diagonal , with entries equal to @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "thus if we meet the three conditions that @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath110 for @xmath103 , then the simulation method is exact .",
    "we will revisit these conditions in our applications section .",
    "in this section we test our algorithm on an improper fractional gaussian noise ( fgn ) process .",
    "the complex - valued fgn process @xcite is a stationary gaussian process which , when regularly sampled at timesteps @xmath5 , has autocovariance @xmath111 where @xmath112 is known as the hurst parameter and controls the roughness or smoothness of the process , with a higher value leading to a smoother process .",
    "the normalizing parameter @xmath113 is set as @xmath114 which is required to regulate the behavior of fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) @xcite , where fgn is defined as the increment process of a regularly sampled fbm .",
