    "kaonic atom data provide a valuable consistency check on any microscopic theory of the @xmath0 nucleon interaction in nuclear matter .",
    "we therefore apply the microscopic approach , developed by one of the authors in @xcite , to kaonic atoms .",
    "the description of the nuclear level shifts in @xmath0 atoms has a long history .",
    "for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "we recall here the most striking puzzle . in the extreme low - density limit the nuclear part of the optical potential , @xmath1 ,",
    "is determined by the s - wave @xmath2 scattering length : @xmath3 with @xmath4 , the nucleus density profile @xmath5 and the reduced kaon mass @xmath6 of the @xmath0 nucleus system . as shown by friedman ,",
    "gal and batty @xcite kaonic atom data can be described with a large attractive effective scattering length @xmath7 fm , which is in direct contradiction to the low - density optical potential ( [ ldt ] ) .",
    "the present data set on kaonic level shifts include typically the 3d@xmath82p transition for light nuclei and the 4f@xmath83d transition for heavy nuclei .",
    "deeply bound kaonic states in an s - wave have not been observed so far .",
    "since a @xmath0 bound in a p - wave at a nucleus probes dominantly the low - density tail of the nucleus profile one may conclude that the optical potential must exhibit a strong non - linear density characteristic at rather low density .",
    "a further complication was pointed out for example by thies @xcite , who demonstrated that in the kaonic @xmath9 system non - local effects may be important .",
    "the importance of non - local effects was also emphasized in @xcite .",
    "in fact a reasonable description of kaonic atom level shifts was achieved by mizoguchi , hirenzaki and toki @xcite with a phenomenological non - local optical potential of the form @xmath10 where the parameter @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "though it has been long anticipated that the @xmath13 resonance plays a key role @xcite , a microscopic description of kaonic atom data remains a challenge .",
    "obviously an important ingredient of any such attempt must be a proper many - body treatment of the @xmath14 resonance structure in nuclear matter .",
    "in this section we prepare the ground for our study of kaonic atoms . of central importance",
    "is the kaon self energy , @xmath15 , evaluated in nuclear matter .",
    "here we introduce the self energy relative to all vacuum polarization effects , i.e. @xmath16 .",
    "first we recall results for the kaon self energy as obtained in a self consistent many - body calculation based on microscopic s - wave kaon - nucleon interactions . for the details of this microscopic approach we refer to @xcite .",
    "we identify the @xmath0-nucleus optical potential @xmath17 by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the free - space kaon energy . in fig .",
    "1 we present the result of @xcite    = 6.5 cm    at nuclear saturation density .",
    "we point out that the real part of our optical potential exhibits rather moderate attraction of less than 40 mev . on the other hand we find a rather strong absorptive part of the optical potential .",
    "this is in disagreement with recent work by friedman , gal , mares and cieply @xcite .",
    "we recall that in @xcite the quasi - particle energy for a @xmath0 at rest was found to be @xmath20 mev at nuclear saturation density and that the large attraction in the quasi - particle energy is consistent with the moderate attraction in the optical potential .",
    "it merely reflects the strong energy dependence of the kaon self energy induced by the @xmath13 resonance .",
    "such important energy variations are typically missed in a mean field approach .",
    "hence , a proper treatment of the pertinent many - body effects is mandatory .",
    "we analyze the self energy as probed in kaonic atoms in more detail . before we proceed",
    "it is important to straighten out the relevant scales .",
    "since the typical binding energy of a @xmath0 bound at a nucleus in a p - wave is of the order of 0.5 mev the typical kaon momentum is estimated to be roughly 20 mev .",
    "we then expect the relevant nuclear fermi momentum @xmath21 to be larger than the kaon momentum @xmath22 .",
    "= 7.0 cm    for the study of kaonic level shifts it is therefore useful to introduce the effective scattering length @xmath23 and the effective slope parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath26 where we expanded the kaon self energy for small momenta @xmath27 and energies close to @xmath28,[self - expand ] ) do not contradict the low - density theorem .",
    "taking for instance the derivative of @xmath29 with respect to @xmath30 assumes implicitly @xmath31 if the self energy shows a contribution depending on the ratio @xmath32 .",
    "pauli blocking does lead to such a contribution as shown in the appendix . consequently , our optical potential is necessarily incorrect for @xmath33 mev where we recall the typical 3-momentum of the kaon probed in k - atoms .",
    "we anticipate that the systematic error we encounter with our expansion in ( 4 ) is insignificant since the optical potential is already tiny by itself in the region @xmath34 mev .",
    "the main contribution to the kaonic level shifts is expected for @xmath35 . ] .",
    "the rational behind the expansion ( 4 ) will be discussed in more detail in the subsequent section when constructing the optical potential .",
    "it is instructive to derive the model independent low - density limit of the slope parameters : @xmath36 which is given in terms of the kaon - nucleon scattering lengths and the ratio @xmath37 . as demonstrated in the appendix these limits",
    "are determined by the pauli blocking effect which characterizes the leading medium modification of the kaon - nucleon scattering process . using the values for the scattering lengths we obtain @xmath38 fm gev@xmath39 and @xmath40 fm .    in fig .",
    "2 the effective scattering length and the slope parameters are presented as extracted numerically from the self consistent calculation of @xcite . the real part of the effective scattering length @xmath23 changes sign as the density is increased . at large densities",
    "we find an attractive effective scattering length in qualitative agreement with the previous work @xcite .",
    "note that the quantitative differences of the works @xcite and @xcite are most clearly seen in the imaginary part of the effective scattering length in particular at small density .",
    "a more recent calculation by ramos and oset @xcite confirms the results of @xcite at the qualitative level .",
    "the quantitative differences will be discussed in the next section .",
    "most dramatic are the non - linear density effects in the effective slope parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 , not considered in @xcite .",
    "the non - trivial changes in the effective scattering length and effective slope parameters are the key elements of our microscopic approach to the kaonic atom level shifts .",
    "in this section , in order to make an estimate of non - local effects in kaonic atoms , we calculate the spectra with an optical potential @xmath41 deduced from the kaon self energy ( [ beff ] ) but use a phenomenological ansatz for its non - local structure .",
    "our starting point is the klein - gordon equation @xmath42 \\phi(r ) = 2\\ , \\mu \\,u_{\\rm opt.}(r,\\vec",
    "\\nabla ) \\,\\phi(r ) , \\label{kg}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the binding energy and width of the kaonic atom , whereas @xmath45 is the reduced kaon mass in the @xmath0 nucleus system .",
    "the electromagnetic potential @xmath46 is the sum of the coulomb potential and the uehling and kllen - sabry vacuum polarization potentials @xcite folded with the nucleus density profile .",
    "the nuclear densities are taken from @xcite , where they are obtained by unfolding a gaussian proton charge distribution from the tabulated nuclear charge distributions @xcite .",
    "we solve the klein - gordon equation ( [ kg ] ) using the computational procedure of krell and ericson @xcite .",
    "for the optical potential @xmath47 , appearing on the right - hand - side of ( [ kg ] ) , we make the following ansatz : @xmath48   \\rho(r)\\ ; , \\nonumber\\\\ \\nonumber \\\\ 2 \\mu \\,v_1   & = &   4 \\pi \\left(1+{m_k \\over m_n } \\right ) b[\\rho(r ) ] \\rho(r )   \\vec \\nabla^2   \\ ; , \\nonumber\\\\ 2 \\mu \\,v_2   & = &   4 \\pi \\left(1+{m_k \\over m_n } \\right ) b[\\rho(r ) ] \\vec",
    "\\nabla \\rho(r ) \\cdot \\vec \\nabla \\ ; , \\nonumber\\\\ 2 \\mu \\,v_3   & = &   4 \\pi \\left(1+{m_k \\over m_n } \\right ) b[\\rho(r ) ] [ \\vec \\nabla^2 \\rho(r ) ] \\;.",
    "\\label{v}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in contrast to the approach of @xcite we do not fit the spectrum .",
    "the effective scattering length @xmath49 $ ] and the effective slope parameter @xmath50 $ ] in ( [ v ] ) are determined by the expansion of the @xmath0 self energy at small momenta ( see ( [ beff ] ) ) : we identify @xmath51 and @xmath52 . the optical potentials ( [ v ] ) follow from ( [ beff ] ) with @xmath53 replaced by the momentum operator @xmath54 .",
    "of course , this heuristic procedure is not unique and may lead to different ways of ordering the gradients .",
    "for this reason we study the three different cases in ( 7 ) separately .",
    "although our procedure of constructing the optical potential is not strict , it allows us to make an estimate of the magnitude of the non - local effects , usually neglected in other approaches .",
    "a more systematic derivation of the non - local part of the optical potential is presented in the subsequent section .    here",
    "we wish to emphasize an important aspect related to the expansion suggested in ( 4 ) . in the previous section we argued that the typical kaon momentum @xmath30 up which ( 4 ) should represent the kaon self energy is rather small with @xmath55 mev .",
    "this observation is evidently true if the gradient in ( 7 ) is acting on the kaon wave function .",
    "however , if the proper gradient ordering asks for a sizeable contribution in which the gradient is acting on the nucleus density profile this can not be true anymore .",
    "such terms probe the surface thickness of the nucleus which in turn would require that the expansion in ( 4 ) represents the kaon self energy up to much larger momenta @xmath56 mev .",
    "this leads to a severe conflict , because the expansion in ( 4 ) can only be performed for the typical momentum @xmath30 smaller than the typical fermi momentum : if the non - local pauli blocking contribution is to be expanded one must either assume @xmath57 or @xmath58 ( see appendix ) .",
    "we conclude that given the effective functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 only , we can at most expect to derive terms in the optical potential linear in @xmath61 .",
    "a term like given in the last line of ( 7 ) is outside the scope of this work , because its systematic derivation requires a more general input .",
    "note that an analogous consideration applies to the expansion of the self energy in powers of @xmath62 .",
    "the nuclear energy shift @xmath63 and the width @xmath44 of the 3d@xmath82p transition ( @xmath64b,@xmath65c ) and the 4f@xmath83d transition ( @xmath66al,@xmath67s ) are presented in tab .",
    "1 . in the second column ( ldt )",
    "we recall the results obtained with the optical potential determined by the low - density theorem ( [ ldt ] ) . in the next column",
    "we present the results obtained with the effective scattering length @xmath68 , as shown in fig .",
    "2 . the use of the density dependent scattering length improves the agreement with the empirical data as compared to the density independent scattering length .",
    "in particular the level widths increase towards the empirical values . in the next three columns",
    "we show the results obtained with the non - local potentials of ( [ v ] ) with @xmath69 . for all considered nuclei",
    "we observe the same type of the change in the spectrum .",
    "in contrast to @xmath70 , the effects of @xmath71 are large . whereas the level energies are affected only moderately by @xmath71 the widths of the kaonic atom levels are increased significantly by hundreds of ev .",
    "this is an effect leading towards the proper spectrum .",
    "however , in our case the strength of @xmath72 is too small to obtain a completely successful agreement with data though a semi - quantitative description is achieved . an improved phenomenological description of the selected cases follows if the effective scattering length @xmath73 of ramos and oset @xcite is combined with the effective slope parameter @xmath60 of fig .",
    "2 . the results , shown in the second last row of tab . 1 , agree remarkably well with the data . of course",
    "it is not consistent to combine the two different calculations @xcite .",
    "the last column is included only to demonstrate that there may be many different ways to describe the k - atom data in a phenomenological approach .    from our previous discussion it should not be a surprise that @xmath74 leads to unphysical results as clearly proven in tab .",
    "1 . the huge effects found for that form of the optical potential are an indication that one should also investigate non - local effects involving terms like @xmath75 or @xmath76 systematically .",
    "such effects are outside the scope of the present study because they are clearly not determined by the effective slope parameter @xmath60 .",
    "they will be carefully investigated in a separate work .",
    "we stress that we do not advocate that either of the three phenomenological gradient orderings is realistic . tab . 1",
    "is included in this work to demonstrate that non - local effects are important and in particular that it is crucial to derive the proper gradient ordering systematically .",
    "furthermore we point out that the expansion of the kaon self energy in small momenta @xmath30 in ( [ beff ] ) requires that the contribution of the region @xmath77 mev to the kaonic level shifts is insignificant . in order to verify this assumption we artificially modified the slope function such that it is zero at @xmath78 but agrees to good accuracy with @xmath24 for @xmath79 mev .",
    "this is achieved with : @xmath80 we considered the implication of the modified slope function ( [ beff - rescale ] ) for the level shift of the @xmath81 system .",
    "the optical potentials @xmath82 and @xmath83 are found rather insensitive to the modification of @xmath24 according to ( [ beff - rescale ] ) , the level shift and width change by less than @xmath84 .",
    "it is instructive to compare our results with the analysis of ramos and oset @xcite . in their approach",
    "the real part @xmath49 $ ] becomes positive at somewhat smaller densities , as compared to the calculation @xcite .",
    "a more rapid change of re @xmath49 $ ] leads to a stronger attraction of the optical potential @xmath85 and better agreement with empirical level shifts @xcite ) is used for the @xmath86c k@xmath87 system the nuclear level shift is @xmath88 ev and @xmath89 ev . ] .",
    "we point out that the recent calculations @xcite are not conclusive since first , they ignore the important non - local structure of the optical potential and second , the optical potential is still subject to sizeable uncertainties from the microscopic kaon - nucleon interaction .",
    "strong non - local effects are an immediate consequence of the @xmath90-resonance structure and an important part of any microscopic description of kaonic atom data .",
    "the uncertainties in the optical potential reflect the poorly determined subthreshold kaon - nucleon scattering amplitudes .",
    "the isospin zero amplitude of @xcite and @xcite differ by almost a factor two in the vicinity of the @xmath90-resonance .",
    "naively one might expect that the amplitudes of @xcite are more reliable since they are constructed to reproduce the amplitudes of @xcite which are based on a chiral @xmath91 analysis of the kaon - nucleon scattering data to chiral order @xmath92 as compared to the analysis of ramos and oset , which considers only the leading order @xmath93 .",
    "on the other hand the amplitudes of @xcite include further channels implied by @xmath91-symmetry but not included in the amplitudes of @xcite .",
    "also the work by ramos and oset includes the effect of an in - medium modified pion propagation not included in @xcite .",
    "note , however that such effects are not too large at small density .",
    "clearly a reanalysis of the scattering data and the self consistent many - body approach in an improved chiral @xmath91 scheme is highly desirable @xcite .",
    "in this section we suggest to systematically construct the non - local part of the optical potential by a semi - classical expansion of the nucleus structure . in the previous section",
    "we have demonstrated that the ordering of the gradient terms has dramatic influence on the kaonic level shifts .",
    "naively one may conjecture that the gradient ordering should be s - wave like since the vacuum kaon - nucleon interaction is s - wave dominated .",
    "a perturbative s - wave interaction would give rise to the gradient ordering suggested in @xcite in contrast to the phenomenological successful kisslinger potential @xcite employed in @xcite .",
    "however , since the kaon self energy is obtained in a non - perturbative many - body approach it is not obvious as to which gradient ordering to choose .",
    "in particular it is unclear to what extent the gradients are supposed to act on the function @xmath24 in ( [ beff ] ) .",
    "since @xmath24 is a rapidly varying function in the nuclear density such effects have to be considered .",
    "the starting point of our semi - classical approach is the klein - gordon equation @xmath94 \\phi({\\vec r}\\,)= 2\\,\\mu\\,\\int d^3r'\\ , u_{\\rm opt . }",
    "( \\omega , { \\vec r},{\\vec   r}\\ , ' ) \\,\\phi({\\vec r}\\ , ' ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the non - local @xmath0 nuclear optical potential @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "since the binding energy @xmath43 of a kaonic atom is of the order of hundreds of kev it will be justified to expand the nuclear optical potential in the kaon energy @xmath97 around the reduced kaon mass @xmath6 . here",
    "we exploit the obvious fact that the nuclear part of the potential varies extremely smoothly at that scale .    in order to derive the form of the non - locality in the nuclear optical potential",
    "it is useful to consider the in - medium kaon - nucleon scattering process .",
    "the s - wave @xmath0-nucleon interaction of @xcite implies that the scattering amplitude , @xmath98 , depends exclusively on the sum of initial kaon and nucleon momenta @xmath99 , and energies @xmath97 .",
    "close to the kaon - nucleon threshold the former can therefore be represented by the density dependent coefficients @xmath100 and @xmath101 @xmath102 where we suppress higher order terms for simplicity .",
    "we note that at vanishing baryon density one expects from covariance @xmath103 . in the nuclear medium , however , the functions @xmath104 and @xmath105 are independent quantities .",
    "the model independent low - density characteristic is derived in the appendix : @xmath106 it should not come as a surprise that we find @xmath107 and @xmath108 at small density .",
    "the leading term follows upon expansion of the scattering amplitude in powers of small momenta followed by the low density expansion . for details",
    "we refer to the appendix .",
    "in fact the expansion in ( [ amplitude ] ) stops to converge at @xmath109 .",
    "since the scattering amplitude leads to the kaon self energy via @xmath110 we conclude that at small density ( with @xmath111 mev ) an accurate representation of the kaon self energy requires an infinite number of terms in ( [ amplitude ] ) .",
    "a manifestation of this fact is that @xmath112 and @xmath113 at small density .",
    "we observe that at somewhat larger density with @xmath114 mev @xmath115 mev , one obtains a faithful representation of the self energy keeping only a few terms in ( [ amplitude ] ) . in any case our final optical potential ( 23 ) will be expressed directly in terms of @xmath116,@xmath24 and @xmath25 defined in ( [ beff ] ) and extracted numerically form the kaon self energy of @xcite ( see discussion below ( [ atilde ] ) ) .    in order to proceed and derive the non - local kaon optical potential we generalize ( [ selfenergy ] ) , which holds for infinite homogeneous nuclear matter , to the non - local system of a nucleus ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath117 here we introduced the non - local amplitude @xmath118 and the nucleon wave function @xmath119 for a given nucleus in a shell model description .",
    "@xmath120 is the energy of the single particle wave function and the index @xmath121 sums all occupied shell model states of the nucleus .    to make contact with the formalism for homogeneous nuclear matter",
    "it is useful to transform the amplitude @xmath122 to momentum space @xmath123 with @xmath124 . in the limit of infinite and homogeneous nuclear matter",
    "the amplitude @xmath125 does not depend on @xmath126 and equals the previously analyzed amplitude of ( [ amplitude ] ) .",
    "for the non - local system we identify : @xmath127 with @xmath128 the density profile of the nucleus .",
    "we emphasize that the identification ( 15 ) neglects an explicit dependence of the in - medium scattering amplitude on @xmath75 .",
    "this is of no further concern here , because such effects are not addressed in this work .",
    "we now aim at a shell model independent representation of the non - local optical potential by rewriting it in terms of the nuclear density profile of the nucleus .",
    "consider first the term proportional to @xmath129 in ( [ amplitude ] ) .",
    "we rewrite its contribution to the optical potential by means of the semi - classical expansion @xmath130 where we did not include a spin - orbit force for simplicity ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize that we have to drop all terms in ( 16 ) which involve more than one gradient acting on the density profile .",
    "for such terms the expansion in ( 4 ) does not make any sense . on the other hand , the last term in ( 16 )",
    "is well established and leads to a microscopic interpretation of the gradient ordering for @xmath131 in ( 7 ) .",
    "we turn to @xmath132 in ( [ amplitude ] ) .",
    "this term appears most susceptible to shell effects since it probes the shell model energies @xmath120 explicitly .",
    "again we perform the semi - classical expansion @xmath133 with @xmath134 mev the one - nucleon separation energy of the nucleus .",
    "again one needs to realize that for instance the term with @xmath135 in ( 17 ) is not determined reliably and therefore must be dropped .",
    "this follows , because the expansion of the self energy in powers of @xmath136 is applicable only for @xmath137 mev of the order of the @xmath138-atom binding energy .",

    "2 we compare the results from the low - density optical potential ( [ ldt ] ) with the result of the semi - classical optical potential . the full semi - classical potential represents the empirical level shifts quantitatively but underestimates the empirical widths systematically . as can be seen from tab .",
    "2 the non - local effects increase the level widths by only a small amount towards the empirical values . the results obtained with the semi - classical potential differ significantly from the results obtained with phenomenological potential @xmath131 in ( [ v ] ) with an ad - hoc gradient ordering .",
    "we emphasize that the crucial assumption of our approach , namely that the results are insensitive to the precise form of the slope functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the extreme surface region @xmath184 mev , which justifies the expansion ( [ beff ] ) , is fulfilled .",
    "the size of the level shifts and widths , using @xmath24 and @xmath25 functions modified according to ( [ beff - rescale ] ) , are affected by less than @xmath185 for the @xmath86c k@xmath169 and @xmath158ni k@xmath169 systems .",
    "note that this uncertainty is certainly not resolved by the accuracy of the available empirical level shifts and widths .",
    "we summarize the findings of our work .",
    "the kaon self energy shows a rapid density , energy and momentum dependence in nuclear matter . this rich structure is a consequence of a proper many - body treatment of the @xmath14 resonance structure in nuclear matter invalidating any mean field type approach to kaon propagation in nuclear matter at moderate densities .",
    "thus non - local terms in the optical potential are large and quantitatively important . if included phenomenologically in the calculation of the kaonic atom spectra they cause substantial additional shifts of the binding energies and level widths .",
    "since the kaon self energy must be obtained in a non - perturbative many - body approach it is not immediate as to which gradient ordering to choose .",
    "a phenomenological p - wave like ordering of gradient terms with the strength taken from the many - body calculation of @xcite leads to a satisfactory description of the kaonic atom level shifts .",
    "however , a proper microscopic description of @xmath0-atom data requires a careful derivation of the non - local part of the optical potential .",
    "given the kaon self energy as evaluated for infinite nuclear matter , one can at most establish non - local terms where a gradient is acting on the kaon wave function .",
    "this follows in particular , because the low - momentum expansion of the self energy converges only for @xmath186 once the important pauli blocking effects are considered . in this work we established that for such non - local effects",
    "the typical kaon momentum is indeed smaller than the typical fermi momentum as probed in k - atoms .",
    "this justifies an expansion of the kaon self energy in small momenta .",
    "we reiterate that given only the kaon self energy of infinite nuclear matter any contribution considered for the optical potential which involves @xmath187 is not controlled and therefore must be dropped .",
    "we derived the microscopic structure of the optical potential by means of the semiclassical expansion in the second part of this work systematically . at present",
    "this approach reproduces the empirical level shifts quantitatively but underestimates the empirical widths systematically .",
    "the microscopic optical potential leads to less pronounced non - local effects as compared to the phenomenological optical potential with p - wave like gradient ordering .",
    "further improvements are conceivable . for instance the non - local effects involving @xmath188 should be studied and also p - wave interaction terms should be considered . moreover , the kaonic atom data appear very sensitive to the precise microscopic interaction of the kaon - nucleon system .",
    "an improved microscopic input for the many - body calculation of the kaon self energy is desirable .",
    "this is supported by the recent chiral @xmath91 analysis of the kaon - nucleon scattering data which includes for the first time also p - wave effects systematically @xcite .",
    "it is found that the subthreshold kaon - nucleon scattering amplitudes differ strongly from those of @xcite and that p - wave effects in the isospin one channel are strong .",
    "an evaluation of the many - body effects based on the improved chiral su(3)-dynamics is in progress @xcite .",

    "in this appendix we derive the contribution from pauli blocking to the in - medium kaon - nucleon scattering process and the kaon self energy .",

    "the latter term is important since it renders the derivatives @xmath198 and @xmath199 finite and well defined at @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",
    "we emphasize that the inclusion of the kaon mass modification @xmath202 as required in a self - consistent calculation @xcite leads to a well defined behavior of @xmath203 close to @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
