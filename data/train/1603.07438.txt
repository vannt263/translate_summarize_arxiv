    "network telescope @xcite ( aka blackhole @xcite , darknet @xcite , or network sink @xcite , possibly with some variations ) is a useful instrument for monitoring unused , routeable ip address space .",
    "since there are no legitimate services associated to these unused ip addresses , traffic targeting them is often caused by attacks .",
    "this allows researchers to use telescope - collected data ( together with other kinds of data ) to study , for example , worm propagation @xcite , denial - of - service ( dos ) attacks @xcite , and stealth botnet scan @xcite . despite",
    "that telescope data can contain unsolicited  but not necessarily malicious  traffic that can be caused by misconfigurations or by internet background radiation @xcite , analyzing telescope data can lead to better understanding of _ cybersecurity posture _ , an important problem that has yet to be investigated .    * our contributions . * in this paper , we empirically characterize cybersecurity posture based on a dataset collected by caida s /8 network telescope ( i.e. , @xmath0 ip addresses ) during the month of march 2013 .",
    "we make the following contributions .",
    "* first * , we propose to characterize cybersecurity posture by considering three time series : the number of victims , the number of attackers , and the number of attacks . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first formal definition of cybersecurity posture . *",
    "second * , we define the notion of _ sweep - time _ , namely the time it takes for most telescope ip addresses to be attacked at least once .",
    "we find that sweep - time can not be described by a probabilistic distribution , despite that a proper subset of the large sweep - times follows the power - law distribution .",
    "we show that an appropriate stochastic process can instead describe the sweep - time .",
    "this means that when incorporating sweep - time in theoretical cybersecurity models , it can not always be treated as a random variable and may need to be treated as a stochastic process . *",
    "third * , we find that the total number of attackers that are observed by the network telescope is dominated by the number of attackers from a certain country @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , we observe that both the number of attackers from country @xmath1 and the total number of attackers exhibit a strong periodicity .",
    "although we can not precisely pin down the root cause of this _ dominance and periodicity _ phenomenon , it does suggest that thoroughly examining the traffic between country @xmath1 and the rest of the internet may significantly improve cybersecurity . * fourth * , we investigate whether or not substantially smaller network telescopes would give approximately the same statistics that would be offered by a single , large network telescope .",
    "this question is interesting on its own and , if answered affirmatively , could lead to more cost - effective operation of network telescopes .",
    "unfortunately , our analysis shows that substantially smaller telescopes might not be as useful a single , large telescope ( of @xmath0 ip addresses ) .",
    "* related work .",
    "* one approach to understanding cybersecurity posture is to analyze network telescope data .",
    "studies based on telescope data can be classified into two categories .",
    "the first category analyzes telescope data _ alone _ , and the present study falls into this category .",
    "these studies include the characterization of internet background radiation @xcite , the characterization of scan activities @xcite , and the characterization of backscatter for estimating global dos activities @xcite . however , we analyze cybersecurity posture , especially with regard to attacks that are likely caused by malicious worm , virus and bot activities .",
    "this explains why we exclude the backscatter data ( which is filtered as noise in the present paper ) .",
    "the second category of studies analyzes telescope data together with other kinds of relevant data .",
    "these studies include the use of telescope data and network - based intrusion detection and firewall logs to analyze internet intrusion activities @xcite , the use of out - of - band information to help analyze worm propagation @xcite , and the use of active interactions with remote ip addresses to filter misconfiguration - caused traffic @xcite .",
    "there are also studies that are somewhat related to ours , including the identification of one - way traffic from data where two - way traffic is well understood @xcite .",
    "the other approach to understanding cybersecurity posture is to analyze data collected by honeynet - like systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) . unlike network telescopes",
    ", these systems can interact with remote computers and therefore allow for richer analysis , including the automated generation of attack signatures @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", we are the first to formally define _ cybersecurity posture _ via three time series : the number of victims , the number of attackers , and the number of attacks .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : data - representation ] describes the data and defines cybersecurity posture .",
    "section [ sec : statistical - preliminaries ] briefly reviews some statistical preliminaries . section [ sec : victim - situation ] defines and analyzes the sweep - time .",
    "section [ sec : attacker - situation ] investigates the dominance and periodicity phenomenon exhibited by the number of attackers .",
    "section [ sec : inference ] investigates whether substantially smaller network telescopes would be sufficient or not .",
    "section [ sec : limitations ] discusses the limitations of the present study .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "* data description . *",
    "the data we analyze was collected between 3/1/2013 and 3/31/2013 by caida s network telescope , which is a passive monitoring system based on a globally routeable but unused /8 network ( i.e. , @xmath2 of the entire internet ip v4 address space ) @xcite .",
    "since a network telescope passively collects unsolicited traffic , the collected traffic would contain _ malicious traffic _ that reaches the telescope ( e.g. , automated malware spreading ) , but may also contain _ non - malicious traffic _  such as internet background radiation ( e.g. , backscatter caused by the use of spoofed source ip addresses that happen to belong to the telescope ) and misconfiguration - caused traffic ( e.g. mistyping an ip address by a remote computer ) .",
    "this means that pre - processing the raw data is necessary . at a high level",
    ", we will analyze data @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which are sets of _ flows _ @xcite and are obtained by applying the pre - processing procedures described below .",
    "* data @xmath3 . * based on caida s standard pre - processing @xcite , the collected ip packets are organized based on eight fields : source ip address , destination ip address , source port number , destination port number , protocol , ttl ( time - to - live ) , tcp flags , and ip length .",
    "the flows are reassembled from the ip packets and then classified into three classes : _ backscatter _ , _ icmp request _ and _ other_. at a high level , backscatter traffic is identified via tcp syn+ack , tcp rst , while icmp request is identified via icmp type 0/3/4/5/11/12/14/16/18 .",
    "( a similar classification method is used in @xcite . ) since ( i ) backscatter - based analysis of dos attacks has been conducted elsewhere ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and ( ii ) icmp has been mainly used to launch dos attacks ( e.g. , _ ping flooding _ and _ smurf or fraggle _ attacks @xcite ) , we disregard the traffic corresponding to _ backscatter _ and",
    "_ icmp request_. since we are more interested in analyzing cybersecurity posture corresponding to attacks that are launched through the tcp / udp protocols , we focus on the tcp / udp traffic in the _ other _ category mentioned above . we call the resulting data @xmath3 , in which each tcp / udp flow is treated as a distinct attack .    * data @xmath4 . *",
    "although ( i ) @xmath3 already excludes the traffic corresponding to _ backscatter _ and _ icmp request _ , and ( ii ) @xmath3",
    "only consists of tcp / udp flows in the _ other _ category mentioned above , @xmath3 may still contain flows that are caused by misconfigurations .",
    "eliminating misconfiguration - caused flows in network telescope data is a hard problem because network telescope is passive ( i.e. , not interacting with remote computers @xcite ) . indeed ,",
    "existing studies on recognizing misconfiguration - caused traffic had to use payload information ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is however beyond the reach of network telescope data .",
    "note that recognizing misconfiguration - caused traffic is even harder than recognizing one - way traffic already ( because misconfiguration can cause both one - way _ and _ two - way traffic ) , and that solving the latter problem already requires using extra information ( such as two - way traffic @xcite ) .",
    "these observations suggest that we use some heuristics to filter probable misconfiguration - caused flows from @xmath3 .",
    "our examination shows that , for example , 50% ( 81% ) attackers launched 1 attack ( @xmath5 attacks , correspondingly ) against the telescope during the month .",
    "we propose to extract @xmath4 by filtering from @xmath3 the flows that correspond to remote ip addresses that initiate fewer than 10 flows / attacks during the month .",
    "this heuristic method filters possibly many , if not most , misconfiguration - caused flows in @xmath3 .",
    "even though the ground truth ( i.e. , which tcp / udp flows correspond to malicious attacks ) is not known , @xmath4 might be closer to the ground truth than @xmath3 .",
    "* data representation . * in order to analyze the tcp / udp flow data @xmath3 and @xmath4 , we represent the flows through time series at some _ time resolution _ @xmath6 .",
    "we consider two time resolutions ( because a higher resolution leads to more accurate statistics ) : hour , denoted by `` @xmath7 , '' and minute , denoted by `` @xmath8 . '' for a given time resolution of interest , the total time interval @xmath9 $ ] is divided into short periods @xmath10 according to time resolution @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , and @xmath13 hours ( or @xmath14 minutes ) in this case .",
    "we organize the flows into time series from three perspectives :    * the number of _ victims _",
    "( i.e. , network telescope ip addresses that are `` hit '' by remote attacking ip addresses contained in @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) per time unit at time resolution @xmath6 , * the number of _ attackers _",
    "( i.e. , the remote attacking ip addresses contained in @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) per time unit at time resolution @xmath6 , and * the number of _ attacks _ per time unit at time resolution @xmath6 ( i.e. , tcp / udp flows initiated from remote attacking ip addresses in @xmath3 or @xmath4 are treated as attacks ) .     at time resolution @xmath15 in @xmath3 : each dot represents an ip address , a red - colored dot represents an attacking ip address ( i.e. , attacker ) , a pink - colored dot represents a victim , each arrow represents an attack ( i.e. , tcp / udp flow ) , the number of attackers is @xmath16 , the number of victims is @xmath17 , and the number of attacks is @xmath18 .",
    "the same holds for data @xmath4 .",
    "[ fig : illustration ] ]    as illustrated in figure [ fig : illustration ] , let @xmath19 be caida s fixed set of telescope ip addresses , and @xmath20 be the rest of ip addresses in cyberspace , where @xmath21 .",
    "the major notations are ( highlighted and ) defined as follows :    * @xmath22 : the set of caida s network telescope ip addresses and the set of the rest ip v4 addresses , respectively .",
    "* @xmath23 : time resolution ( @xmath7 : per hour ; @xmath8 : per minute ) .",
    "* @xmath24 and @xmath25 : the sets of _ victims _ attacked at least once during time interval @xmath10 at time resolution @xmath6 in @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . *",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 : the cumulative set of victims that are attacked at some point during time interval @xmath28 at time resolution @xmath6 in data @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . * @xmath29 and @xmath30 : the sets of victims that are attacked at least once during time interval @xmath31 in @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "note that these sets are actually independent of time resolution @xmath6 , but we keep @xmath6 for notational consistence . * @xmath32 and @xmath33 : the sets of _ attackers _ that launched attacks against some @xmath34 during time interval @xmath10 at time resolution @xmath6 in @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "* @xmath35 and @xmath36 : the numbers of _ attacks _ that are launched against victims belonging to @xmath37 and @xmath37 during time interval @xmath10 , respectively",
    ".    * cybersecurity posture .",
    "* we define cybersecurity posture as :    _ ( cybersecurity posture ) _ for a given time resolution @xmath6 and network telescope of ip address space @xmath19 , the _ cybersecurity posture _ as reflected by telescope data @xmath3 is described by the phenomena and ( statistical ) properties exhibited by the following three time series :    * the number of victims @xmath38 , * the number of attackers @xmath39 , and * the number of attacks @xmath35 ,    where @xmath40 .",
    "similarly , we can define cybersecurity posture corresponding to @xmath4 .    based on the above definition of cybersecurity posture ,",
    "the main research task is to characterize the phenomena and statistical properties of the three time series ( e.g. , how can we predict them ? ) and the similarity between them . as a first step ,",
    "we characterize , by using data @xmath3 as an example , the _ number _ of victims @xmath38 rather than the _ set _ of victims @xmath37 , and the _ number _ of attackers @xmath39 rather than the _ set _ of attackers @xmath41 .",
    "we leave the characterization of the _ sets _ of victims and attackers to future study .",
    "moreover , we characterize the _ number _ of attacks @xmath35 rather than the specific classes of attacks , because telescope data does not provide rich enough information to recognize specific attacks . in section [ sec : limitations ] , we will discuss limitations of the present study , including the ones that are imposed by the heuristic data pre - processing method for obtaining @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we briefly review some statistical concepts and models dealing with time series data , while referring their formal descriptions and technical details to @xcite .    *",
    "brief review of some statistical concepts .",
    "* time series can be described by statistical models , such as the autoregressive integrated moving average ( arima ) model and the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity ( garch ) model that will be used in the paper .",
    "the arima model is perhaps the most popular class of time series models in the literature .",
    "it includes many specific models , such as random walk , seasonal trends , stationary , and non - stationary models @xcite .",
    "arima models can not accommodate high volatilities of time series data , which however can be accommodated by garch models @xcite .",
    "garch models also can capture many phenomena , such as dynamic dependence in variance , skewness , and heavy - tails @xcite .    in order to find accurate models for describing time series data",
    ", we need to do model selection .",
    "there are many model selection criteria , among which the akaike s information criterion ( aic ) is widely used .",
    "this criterion is based on appropriately balancing between goodness of fit and model complexity .",
    "it is defined in such a way that the smaller the aic value , the better the model @xcite .    *",
    "measuring the difference ( or distance ) between two time series*. we need to measure the difference ( or distance ) between two time series : @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "this difference measure characterizes :    1 .",
    "the _ fitting _ error , where the @xmath47 time series may represent the observed values and the @xmath48 time series may represent the fitted values ; 2 .",
    "the _ prediction _ error , where the @xmath47 time series may correspond to the observed values and the @xmath48 time series may correspond to the predicted values ; 3 .   the _ approximation _ error , where the @xmath47 time series may describe the observed values and the @xmath48 time series may describe the values that may be inferred ( i.e. , estimated or approximated ) from other data sources ( e.g. , we may want to know whether or not the statistics derived from the data collected by a large network telescope can be inferred from the data collected by a much smaller network telescope ) .    for conciseness , we use the standard and popular measure known as percent mean absolute deviation ( pmad ) @xcite . specifically ,",
    "suppose @xmath49 are given data , and @xmath50 are the fitted ( or predicted , or approximated ) data .",
    "the overall fitting ( or prediction , or approximation ) error ( or the pmad value ) is defined as @xmath51 the closer to 0 the pmad value , the better the fitting ( or prediction , or approximation ) .",
    "we note that our analysis is not bound to the pmad measure , and it is straightforward to adapt our analysis to incorporate other measures of interest .",
    "* measuring the shape similarity between two time series*. two time series may be very different from a measure such as the pmad mentioned above , but may be similar to each other in their shape ( perhaps after some appropriate re - alignments ) .",
    "therefore , we may need to measure such shape similarity between two time series .",
    "dynamic time warping ( dtw ) is a method for this purpose .",
    "intuitively , dtw aims to align two time series that may have the same shape and , as a result , the similarity between two time series can be captured by the notion of _ warping path _ ( aka _ warping function _ ) .",
    "the closer the warping path to the diagonal , the more similar the two time series .",
    "we use the dtw algorithm in the @xmath52 software package , which implements the algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "* the notion of sweep - time .",
    "* figure [ fig : vic - uniq - vic - summary ] describes the times series of @xmath53 in @xmath3 and @xmath54 in @xmath4 . using @xmath3 as example",
    ", we make the following observations ( similar observations can be made for @xmath4 ) . first , there is a significant volatility at the 632nd hour , during which the number of victims is as low as @xmath55 .",
    "careful examination shows that the total number of attackers during the 632nd hour is very small , which would be the cause .",
    "second , most telescope ip addresses are attacked within a single hour . for example , 15,998,907 , or @xmath56 of @xmath57 , telescope ip addresses are attacked at least once during the first hour .",
    "third , no victims other than @xmath58 are attacked during the time interval @xmath59 .",
    "since figure [ fig : vic - uniq - vic - summary ] shows that there are a large number of victims per hour , we ask the following question : how long does it take for most telescope ip addresses to be attacked at least once ? that is : *",
    "how long does it take for @xmath60 victims to be attacked at least once , where @xmath61 ? * this suggests us to define the following notion of _ sweep - time _ , which is relative to the observation start time .    _",
    "( sweep - time ) _ with respect to @xmath3 , the _ sweep - time _ starting at the @xmath62th time unit of time resolution @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath63 , is defined as : @xmath64 corresponding to data @xmath4 , we can define sweep - time @xmath65 as : @xmath66    by taking into consideration the observation starting time @xmath62 , we naturally obtain two time series of sweep - time : @xmath67 for @xmath3 and @xmath68 for @xmath4 .",
    "we want to characterize these two time series of sweep - time .    * characterizing sweep - time . *",
    "since _ per - hour _ time resolution gives a coarse estimation of sweep - time , we use _ per - minute _ time resolution for better estimation of it .",
    "figure [ fig : vic - killtime ] plots the time series of sweep - time @xmath69 , namely a sample of @xmath70 because it is too time - consuming to consider the latter entirely ( time resolution : minute ) .",
    "figure [ fig : vic - killtime ] suggests that the sweep - time time series exhibit similar shape .",
    "accordingly , we use the dtw method to characterize their similarity . recall that dtw aims to align two time series via the notion of _ warping path _ , such that the closer the warping path to the diagonal , the more similar the two time series .",
    "figure [ fig : sweep - time - dtw - d1-d2 ] confirms the above observation , by presenting some examples of the warping paths ( the others are omitted due to space limitation ) .",
    "specifically , figures [ fig : dtw - d1-d2-time-08 ] and [ fig : dtw - d1-d2-time-99 ] show that the sweep - times with respect to @xmath71 and @xmath72 are almost the same in @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "figures [ fig - d1-time-99 - 80 ] and [ fig : d1-time-99 - 95 ] show that for two thresholds , say @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the smaller the @xmath75 , the more similar the two respective time series of sweep - time in @xmath3 .",
    "figures [ fig : d2-time-99 - 80 ] and [ fig : d2-time-99 - 95 ] demonstrate the same phenomenon for @xmath4 .",
    "the above discussion suggests that the notion of sweep - time is not sensitive to spatial threshold @xmath76 .",
    "this leads us to ask : _ * what is the distribution of sweep - time ? *",
    "_ however , this question makes sense only when the time series is stationary . by using an augmented dickey - fuller test @xcite",
    ", we conclude that the sample of the sweep - time time series , namely @xmath69 , is _ not _ stationary , which means that time series @xmath77 is not stationary ( otherwise , the sample should be stationary ) .",
    "therefore , we can not use a single distribution to characterize the sweep - time ; instead , we have to characterize the sweep - time as a stochastic process . in order to identify good time series models that can fit the sweep - time",
