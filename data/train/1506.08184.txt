    "vortices in bose - einstein condensates of alkali atoms first observed in the laboratory in 1999  @xcite . since then numerous experimental and theoretical studies along this direction were performed  @xcite .",
    "for instance , these studies include bending of vortex lines in a cigar shaped trap , array of orderly aligned lattices in the quantum - hall regime , tkachenko oscillations in the lowest landau level and so on  @xcite .",
    "the rotational properties of becs of alkali atoms are reviewed in refs  @xcite .",
    "several techniques such as rotating the magnetic trap , laser stirring , decay of solitons , imprinting vortices using topological phases , superimposing an oscillating excitation to the trapping potential , and applying artificial magnetic fields  @xcite were adopted in bec experiments to nucleate the vortices .",
    "early experiments and theoretical studies on vortices in bec mostly focused on alkali bose gases with local and isotropic interaction .",
    "in particular , there are many numerical studies proposed to analyse the stationary state of rotating alkali becs  @xcite . however , the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation in chromium ( @xmath2cr )  @xcite , dysprosium ( @xmath3dy )  @xcite , followed by erbium ( @xmath4er )  @xcite has enlightened new directions in understanding the properties of bec in dipolar quantum gases .",
    "these recent works has revealed new phenomena due to the peculiar competition between isotropic short - range contact interaction and anisotropic long - range dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) .",
    "the most significant features of the dipolar becs are the emergence of biconcave shaped states , the dependence of the stability on the trap geometry , the roton - like dip in the dispersion relation for excitation waves , and the @xmath5-wave mode of the collapse  @xcite .",
    "the rotational properties of dipolar bose gases have also been studied theoretically in the mean - field regime  @xcite .",
    "these studies revealed that the rotational properties of dipolar becs are strongly influenced by the harmonic trap aspect ratio , ddi strength , contact interaction ( ci ) strength and relative strengths between ddi and ci  @xcite .",
    "square and triangular vortex lattice structures have been predicted in dipolar becs loaded in optical lattice potentials  @xcite .",
    "the stability of dipolar bec is strongly dependent on the trap geometry and dipolar interaction strength .",
    "so far the regime for the stability has been analysed only for the non - vortex states of dipolar becs without rotation  @xcite .",
    "most of the previous studies on vortices in dipolar becs are based on two - dimensional models only  @xcite .",
    "however , it will be more realistic to investigate the stationary vortex structures in full three - dimensions as they are readily comparable with experiments .    in this paper , we study the vortex lattice structures of purely dipolar bose - einstein condensate by considering the full three - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation . in particular , we analyse the stability regime for vortex state in purely dipolar becs with respect to both trap aspect ratio and ddi strength . the stability of the vortices is confirmed by numerically evolving the vortex states in real - time .",
    "we show stationary vortex lattice structures for different trap aspect ratios within the stable regime .",
    "further , we study the collapse dynamics of biconcave shaped condensate during rotation .",
    "we calculate the chemical potential , rms ( root - mean - square ) radius and angular momentum of condensate as a function of rotation frequency .",
    "we estimate the number of vortices using thomas - fermi approximation and compare them with that obtained through numerical simulations .",
    "finally , we notice the breaking of the condensate when the rotating dipolar bec is in the fully anisotropic trap .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : frame ] , we present the mean - field equation to study a dipolar bec in a rotating trapping potential . in sec .  [",
    "sec : stab ] , we show the stability diagram for states without and with vortices in purely dipolar becs as a function of harmonic trap aspect ratio and ddi strength . in sec .",
    "[ sec : vortex ] , we study the stationary vortex structures observed numerically as well thomas - fermi calculation on some physical parameters during rotation of the condensate .",
    "then we investigate the spatial distribution of vortices in a fully anisotropic trap in sec .",
    "[ sec : ani ] .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : con ] , we present a brief summary and conclusions .",
    "the pattern of vortices in the bec can be studied using the mean field gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation  @xcite . at ultra - low temperatures the properties of a dipolar bose - einstein condensate of @xmath6 atoms ,",

    "@xmath15 corresponds to the @xmath16-component of the angular momentum due to the rotation of the dipolar bec about @xmath16-axis with rotation frequency @xmath17 .    for magnetic dipoles ,",
    "the dipolar interaction is given by @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 determines the relative position of dipoles , @xmath20 is the angle between @xmath21 and the direction of polarization , @xmath22 is the permeability of free space , and @xmath23 is the dipole moment of the atom .",
    "@xmath24 is the angle between the orientation of dipoles and @xmath16-axis .",
    "we consider the polarization of magnetic dipoles along the direction of @xmath16-axis as long as @xmath24 = 0 .    to compare the contact and dipolar interactions , it is convenient to introduce the length scale @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "@xmath2cr has a magnetic dipole moment of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the bohr magneton ) so that @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the bohr radius .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction strength is expressed as @xmath30 .",
    "convenient dimensionless parameters can be defined in terms of a reference frequency @xmath31 and the corresponding oscillator length @xmath32 .",
    "using dimensionless variables @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , equation ( [ eqn : dgpe ] ) can be rewritten ( after dropping the primes from all the variables ) as @xmath40   \\phi({\\mathbf { r } } , { t}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 @xmath42 .",
    "we consider the cylindrically symmetric harmonic trap with @xmath43 with @xmath44 and we use the reference frequency @xmath45 as @xmath46 . for the fully anisotropic trap , the reference frequency is taken as the geometric mean , that is , @xmath47 . from now , we only refer to the dimensionless variables .",
    "we perform the numerical simulations of the 3d gp equation  ( [ gpe3d ] ) using the split - step crank - nicolson method described in refs",
    "the dipolar integral in equation  ( [ gpe3d ] ) diverges at a short distance in coordinate space .",
    "however , this can be circumvented by evaluating the integral in momentum space  @xcite . for the parameters we used in this work for the dipolar gp with ( @xmath48 ) , there is no minimizer @xcite , which means there is no actual ground state .",
    "so the states we refer here are in fact lowest local minimum states .",
    "the numerical simulations for the cylindrically symmetric and fully anisotropic traps are carried out with @xmath49 and @xmath50 grid sizes respectively , with @xmath51 ( space step ) and @xmath52 ( time step ) .",
    "the important feature of dipolar bec is the emergence of unusual states .",
    "the lowest local minimum state looks like a biconcave shaped structure where the density maximum is not in the center of the condensate  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the density oscillations of dipolar bec with two and four peaks were also reviewed in a fully anisotropic trap . in this section ,",
    "we are interested in studying the stability and structures in purely dipolar bec in pancake trap .",
    "we have composed the stability diagram for a purely dipolar bec as a function of the trap aspect ratio ( @xmath0 ) and dipolar interaction strength ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "a similar stability diagram is given in ref .",
    "a dipolar bec is unstable and collapses for the number of atoms @xmath6 above a critical value .",
    "this can be studied by solving the three - dimensional time - dependent gp equation  ( [ gpe3d ] ) .",
    "we have broadened the stability diagram to @xmath53 and calculated the stability region of the solutions . the biconcave shaped condensate density as shown in figure  [ fig1](a )",
    "is obtained for the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 from imaginary time propagation . in figure  [ fig1](b )",
    "we have shown the real - time evolution of the biconcave shaped state .",

    "we are interested in rotating this biconcave shaped condensate to study the time evolution . with this objective , we prepared the initial state solution by solving the equation  ( [ gpe3d ] ) using imaginary time propagation in the absence of rotation ( @xmath56 ) and then seed the resulting solution in real - time propagation by applying a rotation with frequency @xmath68 . at the time of rotation , the dipoles are immensely pulled towards the outer rim , and two peaks formed as shown in figure  [ fig2](b ) .",
    "these two peaks sustain for a very short time , and biconcave shaped condensate becomes unstable .    if we analytically evolve an exact solution with zero angular momentum in the @xmath16 direction , then term @xmath69 in equation ( [ eqn : dgpe ] ) plays no role .",
