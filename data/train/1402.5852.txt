    "chromium spinel compounds with formula @xmath3cr@xmath4@xmath5@xmath6 , where @xmath3 is a divalent non - magnetic cation and @xmath5 a divalent anion , exhibit many interesting phenomena such as strong geometric frustration ,  @xcite relaxor multiferroicity ,  @xcite or three - dimensional topological effects  @xcite . at room temperature",
    "these spinels are cubic ( space group fd@xmath7 m ) , where the non - magnetic a - site ions are tetrahedrally coordinated and the cr@xmath8 ions ( electronic configuration 3d@xmath9 with spin s = 3/2 ) in octahedral environment form a pyrochlore lattice ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ablattice ] ) .",
    "the inherent frustration of the pyrochlore lattice is often released by magneto - elastic interactions such as the spin - driven jahn - teller effect  @xcite , which lead to a reduced structural symmetry coinciding with the onset of long - range magnetic order .",
    "the magneto - structural phase transition is reflected in the splitting of infrared ( ir ) and raman active phonons and the crystal - field ( cf ) excitations , which are sensitive to changes of the magnetic and the crystalline symmetry.@xcite since magnetic interactions depend on interatomic distances  @xcite , one can expect structural anomalies not only at low temperatures but also at high pressures .    in general ,",
    "the application of pressure can be used to tune in a controlled fashion the electronic and structural properties of a system , while optical spectroscopy is a powerful method to investigate the electronic and vibrational properties of a material .",
    "the combination of the two techniques thus allows to follow the evolution of the phonon frequencies and the ( possible ) splitting of optical phonon modes with applied pressure , providing useful information on both the magnetic  @xcite and structural properties .",
    "the far - infrared studies on the spinel compounds can indeed reveal information on the structural properties ( e.g. , cation ordering , bond strengths and ionicities ) , on the free carrier contribution , and on magnetic phenomena  @xcite .",

    ".the energies of the electronic transitions for the three investigated cr - spinel compounds at @xmath331  gpa . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     regarding the compressibility difference for the three investigated compounds , the foremost consideration is the part of the unit cell volume , which is mainly occupied by anions . the compressibility is mainly determined by the x - sublattice,@xcite since the number of _ x - x _ bonds is larger compared to the other bonds ( i.e. , cr-_x _ and _ a - x _ bonds ) . in the periodic table , the electronegativity decreases from oxygen to selenium , while the size of ions increases .",
    "the selenium ( se@xmath34 ) ion is bigger as compared to sulphur ( s@xmath34 ) and oxygen ( o@xmath34 ) and this corresponds to a larger bond length of chalcogenides compared to oxides .",
    "application of external pressure will affect the longer bond length stronger than the shorter bond length . with these considerations ,",
    "the chalcogenides are expected to be more compressible as compared to the oxides .",
    "the higher compressibility corresponds to a more covalent character of the chemical bond and a lower ionicity of the anions.@xcite zncr@xmath0se@xmath1 shows semiconducting character , while cdcr@xmath0o@xmath1 shows insulating behavior as covalency increases from the oxide to the selenide . in this respect , the rather small values of the linear pressure coefficient _ c _ for the modes in zncr@xmath4se@xmath6 are surprising .    for the investigated chalcogenide compounds the phonon parameters exhibit anomalies in their pressure dependence : for zncr@xmath0se@xmath1 anomalies occur at p@xmath35@xmath1210  gpa , which are interpreted in terms of a structural phase transition from cubic to tetragonal symmetry .",
    "this is supported by an x - ray powder diffraction study  @xcite where a pressure - induced structural phase transformation from cubic ( fd@xmath36 m ) to tetragonal ( i@xmath37 ) was reported for cdcr@xmath4se@xmath6 at around 10 gpa .",
    "the phonon parameters of hgcr@xmath0s@xmath1 show an anomaly at around 12  gpa , which is supported by a very recent raman study of hgcr@xmath0s@xmath1 under pressure . a splitting of vibrational raman modes",
    "was observed starting at around 12  gpa and related to a structural phase transition from a cubic to a tetragonal symmetry observed by diffraction methods.@xcite the compressibility of oxides is low compared to the chalcogenides , since the chemical bonds are very stiff , and therefore the critical pressure is expected to be higher .",
    "indeed , a raman study of zncr@xmath0o@xmath1 under pressure reveals a sluggish structural phase transition starting at 17.5 gpa , which is completed at around 35 gpa.@xcite consistent with this is the absence of an anomaly for the phonon modes in cdcr@xmath0o@xmath1 up to 14.0  gpa according to our data .",
    "signatures of the pressure - induced structural phase transition are also expected in the pressure evolution of the electronic excitations .",
    "therefore , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : transpr ] the change in the reflectivity spectra as a function of pressure at 5000 @xmath2 and 7500 @xmath2 for zncr@xmath0se@xmath1 and hgcr@xmath0s@xmath1 , since the reflectivity in this range relates to the electronic excitations in the materials . for zncr@xmath0se@xmath1 the reflectivity versus pressure curve shows a continuous increase in r@xmath22 with increasing pressure up to 10  gpa . by further increasing pressure",

    "fig : cdcro_abs - freq](b ) and [ fig : sw ] ] . a higher value of the critical pressure for cdcr@xmath0o@xmath1 as compared to the chalcogenides is consistent with our low - frequency results .",
