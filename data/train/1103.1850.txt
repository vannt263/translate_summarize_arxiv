    "in 1963 e. lorenz by a drastic truncation of fluid - dynamics equations governing the atmospheric motion obtained a system of ode which he proposed as a crude yet non trivial model of thermal convection of the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "as a matter of fact , the lorenz model is today understood as a basic toy - model for the evolution of earth atmosphere s regimes , like zonal or blocked circulation or climate regimes ( e.g. warm and cold ) , in which dynamics is described by equilibrium states @xcite , @xcite . in his work lorenz showed such system to exhibit , for a large set of parameters values , a peculiar chaotic behavior , that is exponential sensitivity to perturbations of initial conditions and the existence of a global attracting set for the flow nowadays called generalized nontrivial hyperbolic attractor .",
    "although there exists an extensive literature on the subject , we refer the reader to @xcite for a rather comprehensive overview on this problem and to @xcite for a recent account on the progress made on the rigorous analysis of the lorenz 63 ode  system and the relationship between this and its more abstract counterpart , the geometric lorenz model , introduced in the second half of the seventies ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) to describe the geometrical features a dynamical system should posses in order to exhibit the same asymptotic behavior as the lorenz one .",
    "an affirmative answer to the long - standing question whether the original lorenz 63 flow fits or not the description of the one modeled by the geometric lorenz , which means it supports a robust singular hyperbolic ( strange ) attractor , has been given by w. tucker in @xcite by means of a computer assisted proof .",
    "as a byproduct , tucker also proved that lorenz flow admits a unique srb measure supported on the strange attractor .",
    "further results about the characterization of the set of geometric lorenz - like maps are given in @xcite .    in 2000",
    "it has been emphasized that lorenz 63 model and the kolmogorov one , considered as a low - order approximation of the navier - stokes equations , belong to a particular class of dynamical systems , named kolmogorov - lorenz systems @xcite , whose vector field admits a representation as a sum of a hamiltonian @xmath0-invariant field , a dissipative linear field and constant forcing field ( see also @xcite for an extension of this analysis to the lorenz 84 model ) .",
    "moreover , they proved that the chaotic behavior of these models relies on the interplay between dissipation and forcing .",
    "more specifically , and more recently , in @xcite it has been shown that the effect of the dissipative and forcing terms appearing in the previously described decomposition of the lorenz 63 vector field , with the classical set of parameters , is to induce chaotic oscillations in the time evolution of the first integrals of the hamiltonian system associated to the lorenz 63 model , namely the hamiltonian and the casimir function for the ( + ) lie - poisson brackets associated the @xmath1 algebra @xcite , which represents the angular momentum of a free rigid body in the kolmogorov - lorenz representation of geofluid dynamics introduced in @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that two subsequent oscillation peaks in the plot of the casimir function @xmath2 as a function of time are related by a map @xmath3 of the interval similar to the one originally computed by lorenz in @xcite depicting the functional dependence of two subsequent maximum values assumed by the third coordinate of the flow as a function of time .",
    "we remark that , being @xmath2 the square norm of the flow , the similarity of the plots of this two maps is therefore not surprising . in @xcite ,",
    "the recurrence properties of @xmath3 are also studied , which allows to characterize the trajectories of the system through the number of revolution they perform around the unstable point lying on one side of the plane @xmath4 when the initial condition is chosen on the opposite side ( @xcite figg .",
    "2,10 and 11 ) .",
    "in our paper we clarify what stated in @xcite by giving an account in the first section of the rigid body formulation of the lorenz 63 model and constructing , in the next section , a markov expanding lorenz - like map @xmath5 of the interval being the reduction to @xmath6   $ ] of @xmath7 both maps are in fact derived throughout the poincar map associated to the surface in the configuration space of the system corresponding to the set of maxima reached by the casimir function during its time evolution .",
    "hence , we will study the invariant measure under the dynamics defined by @xmath5 characterizing its density and consequently the srb measure of the system .",
    "furthermore , we analyse the recurrence properties of the dynamics induced by @xmath5 clarifying more rigorously what stated in section iv b of @xcite",
    ".    we will also perturb the system by adding an extra forcing term which will eventually cause the system to loose its symmetry under the involution @xmath8 of @xmath9 due to the robustness of the attractor , i.e. persistence under perturbations of the parameters , proved in @xcite , maps analogous to @xmath5 can be defined and studied , and their statistical properties analysed as in the unperurbed case . therefore",
    ", such perturbation of the lorenz 63 field will only have the effect to induce a change in the statistics of the invariant measure for the system , the srb measure .",
    "we will prove that this change could be detected by looking at the deviation of the invariant density of the perturbed map with respect to the unperturbed one .",
    "such result would confirm what has been empirically shown in @xcite about the impact of anthropogenic forcing to climate dynamics of the northern hemisphere .",
    "we also believe that this analysis could also be pursued in the case of more general @xmath10-dimensional models such as those introduced by zeitlin in @xcite to approximate in the limit of @xmath10 tending to infinity the dynamics of the atmosphere in absence of dissipation and forcing .",
    "we will present elsewhere our contributions in these directions ; here we prove the first non - trivial result about the statistical stability of the invariant measure for @xmath11 the technique we propose is new and we believe it could be applied as well for other maps with some sort of criticalities .",
    "we remark that , in particular , the distribution of the return times of a measurable subset of @xmath12,$ ] which can be derived directly from the invariant measure of @xmath13 could be useful in studying the statistics of extreme meteorological events .",
    "it can be shown ( @xcite ) that the lorenz 63 ode system @xcite , @xmath14{l}\\dot{x}_{1}=-\\sigma x_{1}+\\sigma x_{2}\\\\ \\dot{x}_{2}=-x_{1}x_{3}+\\rho x_{1}-x_{2}\\\\ \\dot{x}_{3}=x_{1}x_{2}-\\beta x_{3}\\end{array } \\right .",

    "this representation allows to study the lorenz system as a perturbation of the hamiltonian system @xmath23 admitting , as in the case of a rigid body with a fixed point , two independent first integrals @xmath24 and the casimir function @xmath2 for the poisson brackets ( [ lpb ] ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , when rewritten in this form , it follows straightforwardly that the system is non chaotic for @xmath25 @xcite while , for @xmath26 the values of @xmath2 and @xmath24 undergo chaotic oscillations @xcite .",
    "moreover , when passing to the representation ( [ lpp ] ) , the symmetries of the system are preserved as well as other features such as the invariance of the @xmath27 axis and the direction of rotation of the trajectories about this axis .",
