    "the approach outlined below is applicable to all dynamical systems with hermitian jacobian matrices , and in particular to all networks of symmetrically - coupled one - dimensional dynamical units .",
    "however , for the sake of illustration , we first consider specifically the example of @xmath0 coupled phase oscillators @xmath1 here , @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the phase and the intrinsic frequency of node @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the weight matrix of an undirected , weighted interaction network .",
    "two oscillators @xmath6 are thus connected if @xmath7 .",
    "equation   represents the so - called kuramoto model , that is today considered to be a paradigm for the study of synchronization phenomena in coupled discrete systems @xcite .",
    "the model is therefore used as the natural benchmark for comparative evaluations of performances of methods and tools .",
    "it is known that the kuramoto - model can exhibit phase - locked states , which correspond to steady states of the governing system of equations .",
    "the local stability of such states is determined by the spectrum of the jacobian matrix @xmath8 defined by @xmath9 .",
    "as @xmath10 is symmetric , its spectrum is real .",
    "the state under consideration is asymptotically stable if all eigenvalues are @xmath11 .",
    "below , we analyze the spectrum of @xmath10 by means of jacobi s signature criterion ( jsc ) .",
    "the jsc ( also known as sylvester criterion ) states that a hermitian or symmetric matrix @xmath10 with rank @xmath12 has @xmath13 negative eigenvalues if and only if all principal minors of order @xmath14 have the sign of @xmath15 @xcite . here",
    ", the principal minor of order @xmath16 is defined as @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "stability analysis by means of jsc is well - known in control theory @xcite and has been applied to problems of different fields .",
    "for instance , the jsc has been used in @xcite to analyze advection - diffusion equations , and in @xcite to determine stability boundaries in thermodynamic systems .",
    "moreover , it has been applied to study the dynamics of offshore platforms @xcite and social systems @xcite .",
    "two obstacles that are encountered in the application of the jsc to large networked systems are the growth of ( a ) the number of terms in each determinant , and ( b ) the number of determinants that have to be checked .",
    "difficulty ( a ) can be overcome by means of a graphical notation , which allows to derive topological stability criteria .",
    "this notation is introduced in sec .",
    "[ notation_sec ] . difficulty ( b ) can be evaded by considering necessary rather than sufficient conditions for stability : while the sufficient condition for stability necessitates the evaluation of all principal minors , a necessary condition for stability is already obtained by demanding for some @xmath16 .    the necessary stability condition that is found by considering a principal minor of given order @xmath16 depends on the ordering of variables , i.e. , the ordering of rows and columns in the jacobian . by considering different orderings the number of conditions obtained for a given @xmath16",
    "can therefore be increased @xcite . to distinguish minors that are based on different orderings of the variables , we define @xmath19 as a set of @xmath20 indices and @xmath21 as the determinant of the submatrix of @xmath22 , which is spanned by the variables @xmath23 .",
    "therewith , the conditions for stability read @xmath24",
    "below , we address difficulty ( a ) mentioned above , i.e. , the combinatorial explosion of terms that are needed to write out the conditions for increasing @xmath25 . in the common notation ,",
    "more than @xmath26 terms are necessary for expressing the minors of order @xmath27 . for circumventing this problem",
    "we employ a graphical notation that captures basic intuition and allows for expressing the minors in a concise way @xcite .",
    "the graphical notation relies on a topological reading of the minors .",
    "we interpret the jacobian @xmath10 as the weight matrix of an undirected , weighted graph @xmath28 .",
    "a jacobian element @xmath29 then corresponds to the weight of a link connecting nodes @xmath4 and @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , we relate products of the jacobian elements to subgraphs of @xmath28 spanned by the respective links . for instance @xmath31",
    "is interpreted as path @xmath32 .",
    "similarly , @xmath33 is interpreted as a closed path from @xmath4 to @xmath30 to @xmath34 and back to @xmath4 .",
    "we can now express the minors of @xmath10 as sums over subgraphs of @xmath28 .",
    "the leibniz formula for determinants @xcite implies that ( i ) a minor @xmath35 is a sum over @xmath36 elementary products @xmath37 ; and that ( ii ) in each of these products every index @xmath38 occurs exactly twice . in the topological reading",
    "this translates to the following statements : because of property ( i ) , each term of a minor @xmath35 corresponds to a subgraph with @xmath39 links .",
    "because of property ( ii ) , these subgraphs can be decomposed in cycles of @xmath28 : every index @xmath40 occurs either with multiplicity two on a diagonal element of @xmath10 , or , with multiplicity one , on two off - diagonal elements of @xmath10 . in the former case , the respective factor corresponds to a self - loop of @xmath28 , i.e. , to a cycle of length @xmath41 ; in the latter case , there is a set of factors @xmath29 , @xmath42 , corresponding to a closed path of links , i.e. , a cycle of length @xmath43 .    in summary , the index structure of every term of a minor @xmath35 can be expressed by a combination of symbols denoting cycles of @xmath28 of a given length @xmath44 .",
    "the idea is now to supplement the basis of symbols with a summation convention ; this convention is designed such that all algebraic terms that are structurally identical and only differ by index permutations can be captured in one symbolic term , which drastically reduces the complexity of the expressions .    . here , as well as in the next figures ,",
    "filled symbols correspond to nodes @xmath45 , open symbols to nodes @xmath46.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    below , we use the following definitions : the basis of symbols is given by @xmath47 denoting cycles of length @xmath48 .",
    "the summation convention stipulates that in a minor @xmath21 , every product of symbols denotes the sum over all non - equivalent possibilities to build the depicted subgraph with the nodes @xmath45 ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 ) .",
    "with these conventions the first @xmath49 principal minors can be written as    [ det_n ] @xmath50    more generally , @xmath51 where symbols with @xmath52 appear with a factor of @xmath53 that reflects the two possible orientations in which the corresponding subgraphs can be paced out .",
    "symbols with an even ( odd ) number of links carry a negative ( positive ) sign related to the sign of the respective index permutation in the leibniz formula for determinants @xcite .",
    "an example for the graphical notation is presented in fig .",
    "[ examples ] .",
    "the figure displays the three principal minors of the symmetric @xmath54 matrix @xmath55 in algebraic , and graphical notation .",
    "moreover , it displays for each term the corresponding subgraph of a three - node graph @xmath28 .",
    "in many systems , including the standard kuramoto model , fundamental conservation laws impose a zero - row - sum condition , such that @xmath56 . using this relation",
    ", we can remove all occurrences of elements @xmath57 from the jacobian and its minors @xcite . in the topological reading",
    ", this substitution changes the graph @xmath28 by replacing a self - loop at a node @xmath4 by the negative sum over all links that connect to @xmath4 .",
    "the simplification of the minors due to the zero - row - sum condition can be understood using the example of the eqs .  .",
    "replacing the self - loops , the first term of every minor @xmath21 , @xmath58 , is @xmath59 times the sum over all subgraphs meeting the following conditions : ( i ) the subgraph contains exactly @xmath25 links , and ( ii ) it can be drawn by starting each ( undirected ) link at a different node in @xmath60 . by means of elementary combinatorics it can be verified that all other terms of @xmath21 cancel exactly those subgraphs in @xmath58 that contain cycles .",
    "this enables us to express the minors in another way : defining @xmath61 we can write @xmath62    we remark that for @xmath63 , @xmath64 is the sum over all spanning trees of @xmath28 ( cf .",
    "thus , kirchhoff s theorem @xcite , which has previously been used for the analysis of dynamical systems @xcite , can be regarded as a special case of the more general eq .  .    , defined by the off - diagonal entries of eq .  .",
    "the terms of the minor @xmath65 can be written as @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( cf .",
    "it thus follows that @xmath71 is the sum over all acyclic subgraphs of @xmath28 meeting conditions ( i)(iv).[subgraphs],scaledwidth=48.0% ]     from fig .",
    "[ subgraphs ] .",
    "[ subgraphs2],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the simplification of the minors due to the zero - row - sum condition as well as the relation between the @xmath21 and their topological equivalents @xmath64 can be illustrated by means of a simple example .",
    "consider the symmetric zero - row - sum @xmath72 matrix @xmath73 here , @xmath74 abbreviates @xmath75 . in fig .",
    "[ subgraphs ] , we calculate the minor @xmath76 in terms of the subgraphs of the corresponding graph @xmath28 .",
    "the calculation illustrates the reasoning that lead to the eqs .   and  .",
    "on the one hand , the complete sequence of minors @xmath21 , @xmath77 can be calculated as @xmath78 where @xmath79 , and @xmath80 due to the zero - row - sum condition .    on the other hand , we can use the definition   to construct the sequence @xmath64 , @xmath77 , directly from the graph @xmath28 ( cf .",
    "[ subgraphs2 ] ) . a comparison of both , the algebraic and the topological results , reproduces eq .  .",
    "we note that labeling the nodes in different order would have yielded different algebraic as well as topological expressions .",
    "let us shortly summarize what we obtained so far .",
    "the topological reading of determinants maps a hermitian jacobian @xmath10 with zero row sum onto a graph @xmath28 , whose weight matrix is given by the off - diagonal part of @xmath22 .",
    "the minors of @xmath10 can then be interpreted as sums over terms associated with subgraphs of @xmath28 . combining the eqs .   and",
    ", the algebraic stability constraints on the minors of @xmath10 translate into @xmath81    we emphasize that the graph @xmath28 is not an abstract construction , but combines information about the physical interaction topology and the dynamical units .",
    "for example , if a graph @xmath28 has disconnected components , there is a reordering of the variables @xmath2 , such that @xmath10 is block diagonal .",
    "this implies that the spectra of different topological components of @xmath28 decouple and can thus be treated independently .    from eq .",
    "we can immediately read off a weak _ sufficient _ condition for stability : because @xmath64 is a sum over products of the @xmath29 , a jacobian with @xmath82 @xmath83 is a solution to eq .",
    "irrespective of the specific structure of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "by contrast , if @xmath84 for some @xmath6 , then the existence of solutions of eq .",
    "is dependent on the topology .",
    "the @xmath85-notation allows to investigate which combinations of negative @xmath29 in a graph @xmath28 lead to the violation of at least one of the eqs .",
    ": the definition of @xmath85 implies that any given @xmath64 can be represented as a function over a set of @xmath86 @xmath87 where the @xmath88 are subsets of @xmath60 , and @xmath89 depends on the choice of the @xmath88 .",
    "the key point is now that for showing that a given topological arrangement of negative @xmath29 is incompatible with the stability conditions eqs .",
    ", it suffices to show that there exists some @xmath64 and some expansion thereof , for which there is no solution with all occurring @xmath85 @xmath90 .",
    "let us emphasize that the sketched approach dispenses with the need to specifically calculated any @xmath64 , and hence with addressing the up to @xmath91 terms they subsume .    in @xcite , we employ the outlined approach to show that stability requires that every component of @xmath28 has a spanning tree , whose links all have positive weights . a detailed mathematical proof of this result will be published in @xcite . for the sake of completeness we present a sketch of a proof in appendix a. the proof uses the @xmath85-notation to show that at least one of the necessary conditions must be violated when no spanning tree of positive connections exists .",
    "it thereby also provides an illustration of the direct application of the notation in a calculation .",
    "in addition to the spanning tree criterion for stability , which pertains to a global property of @xmath28 , eq .   implies further restrictions , which pertain to mesoscale properties of @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the weights of all links that are not part of any cycle of @xmath28 have to be positive .",
    "moreover , at most one of the links that build an unbranched segment of a cycle of @xmath28 may have a negative weight .",
    "finally , the weight of a ` negative link ' in an unbranched segment of a cycle of @xmath28 is bounded below by a value that depends on the weights of the other links in the segment ( cf .",
    "fig  [ upperbound ] ) .",
    "note that while the mesoscale criteria restricting the number and position of negative links can be subsumed under the global spanning tree criterion , the mesoscale criteria restricting the weights of possible negative links are inherently bound to the mesoscale .",
    "in particular , the latter can only be derived by considering @xmath64 with small and intermediate @xmath25 .",
    "this highlights the benefits of the proposed approach : the jsc provide stability criteria on all scales @xmath25 , which are made accessible by means of the graphical notation and symbolic calculus .",
    "applied to the kuramoto model defined in eq .  , the spanning tree criterion for stability allows to deduce properties shared by all possible phase - locked states @xcite . in a phase - locked state ,",
    "@xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the stationary phase difference between oscillator @xmath30 and @xmath4 .",
    "given that all link weights @xmath94 , stability of the phase - locked state thus requires that the coupling network has a spanning tree of oscillators obeying @xmath95 .",
    "the derivation of stability criteria by graphical interpretation of the jsc is applicable to all systems with hermitian jacobian matrix .",
    "further , the simplification leading up to the spanning tree criterion is possible , whenever the jacobian has zero row sums .",
    "this condition is satisfied for instance by all systems of the form @xmath96 where the @xmath97 are the weights of a symmetric interaction network and the @xmath98 odd functions .",
    "we emphasize that the approach remains applicable in heterogeneous networks containing different link strengths @xmath97 , coupling functions @xmath98 or intrinsic parameters @xmath99 .    the class of systems to which the present results are directly applicable include general networks of phase oscillators as well as other models such as continuous - time variants of the deffuant model of opinion formation @xcite or a class of ecological metapopulation models @xcite .",
    "although the specific criteria derived above are contingent on the zero - row - sum condition , it can be expected that the general approach proposed here is also applicable to situations where this condition is violated , such as in the model of cooperation among interacting agents studied in @xcite .",
    "a simple extension of eq .   which violates the zero - row - sum condition is found by replacing @xmath99 by a function of @xmath2 , which allows dynamical retuning of the intrinsic frequency , e.g. for modeling homeostatic feedback in neural networks . for illustrating the application of the proposed method to models , in which the zero - row - sum condition is violated in some rows",
    ", we consider another model inspired by neuroscience in the subsequent section .",
    "we now apply the proposed approach to an example of an adaptive network , i.e. , a system in which the topology of the network coevolves with the dynamics of oscillators @xcite . in the context of the kuramoto model , adaptive coupling",
    "has recently attracted keen interest as it allowed to show that the emergence of synchronous motion can be intimately related to a selection mechanism of specific network topologies @xcite , and to the identification of complex hierarchical structures in the graph connectivity @xcite .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 phase oscillators that evolve according to eq .  , while the coupling strength @xmath97 evolves according to @xmath100 the first term in eq .",
    "states that the more similar the phases of two nodes the stronger reinforced is their connection , the second term guarantees convergence . in a stationary , phase - locked state state @xmath101 and",
    "all oscillators oscillate with a common frequency @xmath102 .",
    "the stability of this state is governed by a symmetric jacobian @xmath103 where @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and we have chosen @xmath107 for illustration .",
    "the marked partitioning separates two blocks on the diagonal .",
    "the upper one is a diagonal submatrix of size @xmath108 , @xmath109 , the lower one is a @xmath110 symmetric submatrix with zero row sum , which we denote as @xmath111 .",
    "let us start our analysis by focusing on the upper left block of @xmath10 .",
    "in the chosen ordering of variables , the first @xmath112 minors @xmath21 satisfy the stability condition eq .",
    "iff @xmath113 . concerning the minors of order @xmath114 , the following conventions prove advantageous : below , we consider sets @xmath60 that contain all variables @xmath97 and @xmath44 of the variables @xmath115 . for every such set ,",
    "we define @xmath116 as the subset of @xmath60 that only contains the @xmath44 variables @xmath115 .",
    "moreover , we define @xmath117 as the matrix that is obtained from @xmath111 if all @xmath118 are substituted by @xmath119 .",
    "finally , we define @xmath120 as the determinant of the submatrix of @xmath117 , which is spanned by the variables @xmath121 .",
    "we find that @xmath122 as @xmath117 is symmetric and has a zero row sum , its minors , @xmath123 , can be rewritten using eq .",
    "@xmath124 where @xmath125 refers to subgraphs of the graph @xmath126 defined by the off - diagonal entries of @xmath117 .",
    "stability requires that @xmath127 .",
    "as the necessary stability condition @xmath113 implies @xmath128 , it follows that in a stable system @xmath129 comparison with eq",
    ".   reveals that a necessary condition for stability is that every component of the graph @xmath126 has a positive spanning tree .",
    "revisiting the definitions of graph @xmath126 , we find that the weight of a link @xmath130 of @xmath126 is given by @xmath119 . hence , every component of @xmath126 has a positive spanning tree iff every component of the adaptive coupling network has a spanning tree of oscillators obeying @xmath131 .",
    "the restriction on the stationary phase - differences in a stable , phase - locked state are thus more strict in the adaptive than in the non - adaptive case .",
    "in addition to stability analysis , the graphical notation introduced here allows for instance exploring the isospectrality of hermitian or symmetric matrices @xcite , which differ with respect to the signs of some off - diagonal entries . to see this consider a hermitian matrix @xmath132 .",
    "its characteristic polynomial @xmath133 can be calculated as @xmath134 considering the structure of the graph @xmath28 associated to @xmath135 allows to determine which symbols contribute to @xmath133 .",
    "one can then determine which changes of sign of off - diagonal entries leave all contributing symbols and thus the characteristic polynomial and the spectrum invariant .",
    "for instance , if the graph @xmath28 is a tree , then the only symbols that contribute to the characteristic polynomial @xmath133 are the symbols @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "thus , @xmath133 is a polynomial of factors @xmath138 ( corresponding to symbols @xmath136 ) , and factors @xmath139 ( corresponding to symbols @xmath137 ) . due to the hermiticity of @xmath140 , @xmath141 .",
    "it follows that @xmath133 , and therewith the spectrum , is invariant under any operation that changes the sign of a pair of off - diagonal entries @xmath142 .",
    "along the same line , we can infer isospectrality relations for matrices @xmath140 , whose corresponding graphs @xmath28 are composed only of tree - like subgraphs and isolated cycles . for such matrices ,",
    "the spectrum is invariant under symmetry preserving sign changes of    * an arbitrary number of off - diagonal entries that do not belong to cyclic subgraphs of @xmath28 .",
    "* an even number of off - diagonal entries that belong to the same cyclic subgraph of @xmath28 .",
    "in the present paper we presented a general approach for the analysis of symmetrically coupled systems and a specific simplification for systems , in which the jacobian matrix @xmath10 additionally has a zero row sum .    using a graphical interpretation of jacobi s signature criterion we showed that for all non - trivial eigenvalues of @xmath10 to be negative , the graph @xmath28 , whose adjacency matrix is given by the off - diagonal part of @xmath10 , has to obey necessary topological conditions .",
    "thus , @xmath28 must have a spanning tree of links with positive weights , which restricts the number and position of potential negative entries in the jacobian matrix .",
    "moreover , the absolute value of potential negative link weights is bounded above by a topology depended relation .",
    "we used the approach for deriving necessary conditions for local asymptotic stability of stationary and phase - locked states in networks of phase oscillators .",
    "our results provide an analytical angle that is complementary to statistical analysis of network synchronizability . where statistical approaches reveal global features impinging on the propensity to synchronize",
    ", our approach can pinpoint specific defects precluding synchronization .",
    "we note that such defects can occur on all scales , corresponding to the violation of the signature criterion in subgraphs of different size .",
    "this highlights synchronization of phase oscillators as a simple but intriguing example in which instabilities can arise from local , global or mesoscale structures . in the future , the approach proposed here may provide a basis for further investigation of these instabilities .",
    "a limitation of the present approach is that the jacobian matrix of the state under consideration has to be available in some form .",
    "however , this limitation is inherent to all forms of linear stability and bifurcation analysis and several strategies have been developed for mitigating it .",
    "these include for instance the equation - free approach @xcite , where the desired information on the jacobian is generated on - demand from simulations or experiments , and generalized modeling @xcite , which reveals a parameterized presentation of the jacobian for very general classes of systems .",
    "even if these specific techniques are not applied , researchers are often aware of the structure of the jacobian in the system under consideration , which can be sufficient for gaining some fundamental insights by the proposed approach .",
    "it is apparent that applying the stability analysis proposed here may require overcoming specific problems . in particular",
    ", the requirements of symmetry and zero row sum may necessitate extending the basic scheme or focusing on specific cases , as we did in the adaptive network example .",
    "however , if these problems can be overcome , the approach can reveal hard analytical conditions that all stable steady states must meet .",
    "further , it can identify topological structures ( on all scales ) that prevent the existence of such states and pinpoint them in networks . because this type of information is complementary to insights revealed by common statistical approaches , it potentially of high value for the analysis of the system .",
    "to prove the spanning tree criterion for stability consider that in a network without a positive spanning tree it must be possible to partition the nodes into two nonempty sets @xmath143 , @xmath144 such that @xmath145 the idea is now to evaluate the stability conditions   for different @xmath146 thereby exploiting that all links leading out of @xmath143 have negative weights . for this purpose , it is convenient to define @xmath147 as the set of links connecting @xmath143 and @xmath144 , and @xmath148 as the subset of nodes @xmath149 incident to at least one link from @xmath147 ( ` boundary vertices ' ) . further , we define @xmath150 as the sum over all elements of @xmath147 incident to @xmath2 , and , for any subset @xmath151 of @xmath152 , @xmath153",

    "<S> the central theme of complex systems research is understanding the emergent macroscopic properties of a system from the interplay of its microscopic constituents . here , we ask what conditions a complex network of microscopic dynamical units has to meet to permit stationary macroscopic dynamics , such as stable equilibria or phase - locked states . </S>",
    "<S> we present an analytical approach which is based on a graphical notation that allows rewriting jacobi s signature criterion in an interpretable form . </S>",
    "<S> the derived conditions pertain to topological structures on all scales , ranging from individual nodes to the interaction network as a whole . </S>",
    "<S> our approach can be applied to many systems of symmetrically coupled units . for the purpose of illustration , we consider the example of synchronization , specifically the ( heterogeneous ) kuramoto model and an adaptive variant . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we discuss how the graphical notation can be employed to study isospectrality in hermitian matrices . </S>",
    "<S> the results complete and extend the previous analysis of do et al . </S>",

    "<S> lett . * 108 * , 194102 ( 2012 ) ] .    characterizing the behavior of complex systems and discovering the critical boundaries in parameter space at which qualitative changes occur are of central interest in statistical physics . </S>",
    "<S> many studies have demonstrated that , in specific models , this can be achieved by the instruments of nonlinear dynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , applying these tools to large heterogeneous systems , such as complex networks of dynamical units poses significant challenges @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , there is no simple way to capture the structural aspects of such systems , which are known to crucially influence the emergent dynamics @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the interplay of dynamics and structure in networks has extensively been studied using the example of synchronization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> systems of coupled phase oscillators , originally proposed by kuramoto @xcite , have become a paradigmatic example . </S>",
    "<S> the exploration of such systems revealed that the synchronizability of a network depends on global topological measures such as the clustering coefficient , the diameter , and the degree or weight distribution @xcite , but also on local and mesoscale details @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that a conceptual understanding of collective phenomena on dynamical networks can only be achieved if structural properties on all scales are taken into account .    in a recent paper </S>",
    "<S> , we proposed a nonlinear dynamics approach , which allows to study the dependence of dynamics on structure in networks of symmetrically coupled units @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that jacobi s signature criterion ( jsc ) can be used to determine necessary conditions an interaction network has to obey in order to support a given type of macroscopic behavior . </S>",
    "<S> these conditions pertain to subgraphs on all scales , from single nodes to the entire network . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we complete and extend the analysis of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we present the full derivation of the proposed approach and discuss a number of new applications including an adaptive kuramoto model , in which the topology of the coupling network coevolves with the local dynamics of the phase oscillators @xcite . </S>"
