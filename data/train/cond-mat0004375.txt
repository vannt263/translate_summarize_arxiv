    "<S> when a soap film is used in the experiment , the laminar flow between the cylinders is stable up to very large @xmath2 , and the film gets thicker towards the outer cylinder due to centrifugal force @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> brightly colored patterns are exhibited because of this thickness variation . </S>",
    "<S> however , for smectic - a films with smectic layers parallel to the air - fluid interface , which were treated as two - dimensional systems in many analyses @xcite , there exists a critical speed @xmath3 , such that when @xmath2 is above @xmath3 , defects are generated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly indicates that the layer structure becomes important , and the system can no longer be treated as two - dimensional . on the other hand , experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite studies on the rheological properties of bulk smectic - a systems show that under shear flow , bulk systems are most stable when the layers are parallel to the shear plane . </S>",
    "<S> thus the finite thickness and/or the free surfaces have to be essential to the observed defect generation in the experiments on freely standing smectic - a films .    </S>",
    "<S> in this letter we study the rheology of freely standing thermotropic smectic - a films under shear flow . in a couette geometry </S>",
    "<S> the centrifugal force pushes the liquid crystal away from the inner wall , which induces a layer dilation close to the outer wall . </S>",
    "<S> when this dilation exceeds a certain limit , the smectic layers are no longer stable against small undulational perturbations , hence defects are generated . </S>",
    "<S> this instability is similar to the classical helfrich - surault type instabilities @xcite , but the film has free surfaces and is far from equilibrium . for typical materials and experimental setups the strain induced by centrifugal force provides the critical velocity , @xmath3 , comparable to the experimentally observed result @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus we conclude that this scenario is a good candidate for the mechanism which is responsible for the defect generation in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis indicates that this instability occurs in freely standing smectic - a films but not in bulk smectic - a , since it is a result of the interplay between crossover and boundary effects ( 2d to 3d and the existence of free surfaces ) , and the external driving flow .    </S>",

    "<S> now one can solve eq.([eq : pressure ] ) by direct integration , leading to @xmath95 where @xmath96 will be determined later , by conservation of total volume . since @xmath97 is positive definite for non - vanishing @xmath91 , the pressure near the outer wall is larger than the pressure near the inner wall . </S>",

    "<S> this layer displacement causes a change of the smectic film thickness from @xmath108 to @xmath109 . since the total volume of the liquid crystal in the steady state is the same as that of the initial state ; we determine the pressure at @xmath110 from the condition @xmath111                        \\right)$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> one finds the layers are compressed for small @xmath94 but are dilated for large @xmath94 due to the effect of centrifugal force and conservation of total volume .    </S>",

    "<S> the stability to a layer undulation with wave vector in the radial direction can be analyzed as follows . </S>",
    "<S> choosing @xmath113 , @xmath114 , when @xmath94 is close to @xmath70 with @xmath115 , we can work in cartesian coordinates and ignore the effect of the walls . </S>",
    "<S> the small layer undulation can be expressed as @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> since the shear flow is in the @xmath5 direction , the small layer undulation with in - plane wavevector in the @xmath6 is not convected by the flow ( i.e. , in eq.([eq : u ] ) , @xmath117 vanishes ) , and it evolves towards @xmath118 . </S>",

    "<S> the experimental critical shear rate is about @xmath130 . considering the simplifications made in this model </S>",
    "<S> , the agreement indeed indicates that the effect of layer dilation induced by centrifugal force can cause the instability observed in the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> notice that our model shows the initial instability should occur close to the outer boundary of the couette cell , and this is consistent with the experimental observation .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    [ [ concluding - remarks . ] ] concluding remarks. + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we have shown that freely standing smetic - a films are in principle unstable against strong shear flow . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic length @xmath67 introduced in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite plays an important role . </S>",
    "<S> we considered specifically the couette geometry and included the effects of centrifugal force . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that centrifugal force is capable of inducing a layer dilation close to the outer cylinder . </S>",
    "<S> when the shear rate is large enough , defects are generated due to a layer buckling instability similar to helfrich - surault type instability @xcite , and the calculated critical shear rate is on the same order as the experimental measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> however , notice that the linear stability analysis in this letter is appropriate only for layer undulations with in - plane wavelength small compared to @xmath106 . as we point out , when @xmath131 the first unstable mode against a uniform layer dilation has very long wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> hence , our analysis does not apply to certain materials with weak surface tension . for the material ( 8cb ) used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , @xmath132 , and our analysis is appropriate .    </S>",
    "<S> our calculations have assumed perfectly aligned smectic layers and ignored any interactions between the air or solid boundaries with the liquid crystal . </S>",
    "<S> edge dislocations and the material reservoir commonly observed near the meniscus @xcite , which may not be negligible in the experiment , are also ignored in our approach . due to these simplifications , </S>",
    "<S> our work should only be compared semi - quantitatively with the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that , under strong shear flow  @xcite , defects are generated in freely standing lyotropic smectic - a films in couette geometry . </S>",
    "<S> since the density of the solvent is an extra hydrodynamic variable in lyotropic systems ,  @xcite whether the mechanism for defect generation is the same as that for the thermotropic systems remains to be answered . </S>",
    "<S> however , our study has provided the basic ingredients of the experimental instability , i.e. , the finite film thickness , surface tension , and the geometry of the experimental setup . </S>",
    "<S> it also provides the physical picture of the instability , i.e. , the differences between a smectic - a film and a soap film in couette geometry , and the differences between a bulk system and a freely standing film . </S>",
    "<S> hence we believe that we have achieved our goal , which was to elucidate the basic mechanism behind the interesting experiments reported in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also add to the growing catalog of fascinating properties of smectic - a films far from equilibrium .    </S>",
