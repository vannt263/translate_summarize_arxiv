    "we consider stochastic particle systems which are probabilistic models describing transport of a conserved quantity on discrete geometries or lattices .",
    "many well known examples are introduced in @xcite , including zero - range processes and exclusion processes , which are both special cases of the more general family of misanthrope processes introduced in @xcite .",
    "we focus on spatially homogeneous models with stationary product measures and without exclusion restriction , which can exhibit a condensation transition that has recently been studied intensively .",
    "a condensation transition occurs when the particle density exceeds a critical value and the system phase separates into a fluid phase and a condensate .",
    "the fluid phase is distributed according to the maximal invariant measure at the critical density , and the excess mass concentrates on a single lattice site , called the condensate .",
    "most results on condensation so far focus on zero - range or more general misanthrope processes in thermodynamic limits , where the lattice size and the number of particles diverge simultaneously .",
    "initial results are contained in @xcite , and for summaries of recent progress in the probability and theoretical physics literature see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "condensation has also been shown to occur for processes on finite lattices in the limit of infinite density , where the tails of the single site marginals of the stationary product measures behave like a power law @xcite . in general ,",
    "condensation results from a heavy tail of the maximal invariant measure @xcite , and so far most studies focus on power law and stretched exponential tails @xcite . as a first result , we generalize the work in @xcite and provide a characterization of condensation on finite lattices in terms of the class of sub - exponential tails that has been well studied in the probabilistic literature @xcite . this characterization holds for a particular definition of condensation given in section [ sub sec : ips ] , which was also used in @xcite .",
    "our main result is that all spatially homogeneous processes with stationary product measures that exhibit condensation on finite lattices with a finite critical density are necessarily non - monotone .",
    "monotone ( attractive ) particle systems preserve the partial order on the state space in time , which enables the use of powerful coupling techniques to derive rigorous results on large scale dynamic properties such as hydrodynamic limits ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these techniques have also been used to study the dynamics of condensation in attractive zero - range processes with spatially inhomogeneous rates @xcite , and more recently @xcite .",
    "as we discuss in appendix [ sec : statmech ] , non - monotonicity in homogeneous systems with finite critical density can be related , on a heuristic level , to convexity properties of the canonical entropy . for condensing systems with zero - range dynamics",
    ", it has been shown that this is related to the presence of metastable states , resulting in the non - monotone behaviour of the canonical stationary current / diffusivity @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a first order correction of a hydrodynamic limit leading to an ill - posed equation with negative diffusivity in the case of reversible dynamics .",
    "heuristically , this is of course consistent with the concentration of mass in a small , vanishing volume fraction , but poses great technical difficulties to any rigorous proof of hydrodynamic limits for such particle systems .",
    "first results in this direction only hold for sub - critical systems under restrictive conditions @xcite , and due to a lack of monotonicity there are no results for non - reversible dynamics .",
    "condensing monotone particle systems would , therefore , provide interesting examples of homogeneous systems for which coupling techniques could be used to derive stronger results on hydrodynamic limits .",
    "however , our result implies that this is not possible for condensing models with stationary product measures and a finite critical density on finite lattices . in the thermodynamic limit condensation",
    "has been defined through the equivalence of ensembles , which can be established in generality for a class of long - tailed distributions with a finite critical density @xcite .",
    "this class has also been studied before @xcite and includes the class of sub - exponential distributions , for which our results apply also in the thermodynamic limit . a detailed discussion of their connections and the resulting differences between condensation on finite lattices and in the thermodynamic limit is given in sections [ sec : subexp ] and [ tlimit ] .",
    "we remark that for systems where the dynamics is directly defined on infinite lattices there are no rigorous results or characterizations of condensation to our knowledge , and we do not discuss this case here . for systems with infinite critical density condensation can still occur on finite lattices , and since non - monotonicity typically occurs above the critical density , such processes can also be monotone .",
    "when the tail of the stationary measure is a power law and decays faster than @xmath0 with the occupation number @xmath1 , we prove that the process is still non - monotone . in section [ examples ]",
    "we present preliminary results for tails that decay slower than @xmath0 , which strongly suggests that a monotone and condensing particle system exists ( see @xcite for further discussion ) .",

    "we review examples of homogeneous processes that have been shown to exhibit condensation , and present some explicit computations for misanthrope processes and processes with power law tails .",

    "this typically results from translation invariant dynamics on translation invariant lattices with periodic boundary conditions , but the actual details of the dynamics are not needed for our results . for these systems we define condensation in terms of the maximum occupation number @xmath22    [ condensation ] a stochastic particle system with canonical measures @xmath18 on @xmath17 with @xmath23 exhibits * condensation * if @xmath24 = 1 \\ .",

    "the interpretation of ( [ eqn : cond1 ] ) is that due to the sub - exponential tails of the measure , in the limit @xmath25 all but finitely many particles concentrate in a single lattice site and that the distribution of particles outside the maximum is non - degenerate .",
    "as we will see in proposition [ prop1 ] below , the latter is in fact given by the maximal invariant measure when the system exhibits product stationary measures .",

    "there are sufficient conditions on the jump rates ( [ gene ] ) to ensure monotonicity for a large class of processes ( see e.g. @xcite for more details ) , however for our results we only need a simple consequence for the stationary measures of the process .",

    "the canonical entropy is defined as @xmath482 for the processes we consider , equivalence of canonical and grand - canonical ensembles has been established in @xcite for condensing or non - condensing systems , so @xmath483 is given by the ( logarithmic ) legendre transform of the pressure @xmath484 this takes a particularly simple form since the grand - canonical measures are factorisable , and is a strictly convex function for @xmath485 .",
    "general results then imply that @xmath486 also has to be strictly convex below the critical density @xmath207 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , which holds for non - condensing systems and condensing systems with @xmath487",
    ". for condensing systems with finite critical density @xmath483 is linear for @xmath488 , consistent with phase separation phenomena , where in this case the condensed phase formally exhibits density @xmath489 ( see e.g. @xcite for a general discussion ) .",
    "it is not possible to derive general results for finite @xmath28 and @xmath44 , but if we assume that the ratio of weights @xmath490 is monotone increasing in @xmath1 , we can show that a monotone order of @xmath18 implies that @xmath491 is necessarily convex .",
    "note that with ( [ regu ] ) our assumption implies that @xmath86 has exponential tails with @xmath81 or decays super - exponentially with @xmath492 , and in both cases the system does not exhibit condensation .",
    "we can define @xmath493 so that @xmath494 is a monotone increasing test function on @xmath495 .",
    "it is easy to see that for its canonical expectation we have for all @xmath23 and @xmath496 @xmath497 therefore , monotonicity of the canonical measures implies that the ratio of partition functions ( [ eq : exe ] ) is increasing and the discrete derivative of @xmath498 in @xmath44 is decreasing .",
    "we expect that in the limit @xmath499 the monotonicity assumption on @xmath490 is not necessary , and @xmath500 is convex in @xmath44 for all non - condensing systems , consistent with strict convexity of @xmath483 .    for condensing systems the weights @xmath87 decay sub - exponentially , and",
    "if @xmath490 is monotone then it has to be decreasing in @xmath1 .",
    "therefore the choice @xmath493 implies @xmath501 is not a monotone test function , and the above general arguments can not be used to relate non - convexity of @xmath500 to the absence of a monotone order in @xmath18 . for particular condensing systems , however , it has been shown that @xmath500 is typically convex for small @xmath502 and concave for larger @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "these results focus on power law and stretched exponential tails for @xmath86 , and have been derived for zero - range processes where the ratio @xmath503 is equal to the canonical current .",
    "non - monotone behaviour around the critical density therefore has implications for finite - size corrections and derivations of hydrodynamic limits as mentioned in the introduction .",

    "first consider the case @xmath258 .",
