    "many of the things that scientists measure have a typical size or `` scale''a typical value around which individual measurements are centred .",
    "a simple example would be the heights of human beings .",
    "most adult human beings are about 180 cm tall .",
    "there is some variation around this figure , notably depending on sex , but we never see people who are 10 cm tall , or 500 cm . to make this observation more quantitative , one can plot a histogram of people s heights , as i have done in fig .",
    "[ scale]a .",
    "the figure shows the heights in centimetres of adult men in the united states measured between 1959 and 1962 , and indeed the distribution is relatively narrow and peaked around 180 cm .",
    "another telling observation is the ratio of the heights of the tallest and shortest people .",
    "the guinness book of records claims the world s tallest and shortest adult men ( both now dead ) as having had heights 272 cm and 57 cm respectively , making the ratio 4.8 .",
    "this is a relatively low value ; as we will see in a moment , some other quantities have much higher ratios of largest to smallest .    figure  [ scale]b shows another example of a quantity with a typical scale : the speeds in miles per hour of cars on the motorway . again",
    "the histogram of speeds is strongly peaked , in this case around 75 mph .",
    "but not all things we measure are peaked around a typical value .",
    "some vary over an enormous dynamic range , sometimes many orders of magnitude .",
    "a classic example of this type of behaviour is the sizes of towns and cities .",
    "the largest population of any city in the us is 8.00 million for new york city , as of the most recent ( 2000 ) census .",
    "the town with the smallest population is harder to pin down , since it depends on what you call a town .",
    "the author recalls in 1993 passing through the town of milliken , oregon , population  4 , which consisted of one large house occupied by the town s entire human population , a wooden shack occupied by an extraordinary number of cats and a very impressive flea market .",
    "according to the guinness book , however , america s smallest town is duffield , virginia , with a population of 52 .",
    "whichever way you look at it , the ratio of largest to smallest population is at least @xmath0 .",
    "clearly this is quite different from what we saw for heights of people . and",
    "an even more startling pattern is revealed when we look at the histogram of the sizes of cities , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ cities ] .    in the left panel of the figure ,",
    "i show a simple histogram of the distribution of us city sizes .",
    "the histogram is highly right - skewed , meaning that while the bulk of the distribution occurs for fairly small sizes  most us cities have small populations  there is a small number of cities with population much higher than the typical value , producing the long tail to the right of the histogram .",
    "this right - skewed form is qualitatively quite different from the histograms of people s heights , but is not itself very surprising .",
    "given that we know there is a large dynamic range from the smallest to the largest city sizes , we can immediately deduce that there can only be a small number of very large cities .",
    "after all , in a country such as america with a total population of 300 million people , you could at most have about 40 cities the size of new york . and the 2700 cities in the histogram of fig .  [ cities ] can not have a mean population of more than @xmath1",
    ".    what is surprising on the other hand , is the right panel of fig .",
    "[ cities ] , which shows the histogram of city sizes again , but this time replotted with logarithmic horizontal and vertical axes .",
    "now a remarkable pattern emerges : the histogram , when plotted in this fashion , follows quite closely a straight line .",
    "this observation seems first to have been made by auerbach  @xcite , although it is often attributed to zipf  @xcite .",
    "what does it mean ?",
    "let @xmath2 be the fraction of cities with population between  @xmath3 and @xmath4 . if the histogram is a straight line on log - log scales , then @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are constants .",
    "( the minus sign is optional , but convenient since the slope of the line in fig .",
    "[ cities ] is clearly negative . )",
    "taking the exponential of both sides , this is equivalent to : @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "distributions of the form  ( [ powerlaw ] ) are said to follow a power law .",
    "the constant @xmath6 is called the exponent of the power law .",
    "( the constant  @xmath10 is mostly uninteresting ; once @xmath6 is fixed , it is determined by the requirement that the distribution @xmath11 sum to  1 ; see section  [ normalization ] . )",
    "power - law distributions occur in an extraordinarily diverse range of phenomena .",
    "in addition to city populations , the sizes of earthquakes  @xcite , moon craters  @xcite , solar flares  @xcite , computer files  @xcite and wars  @xcite , the frequency of use of words in any human language  @xcite , the frequency of occurrence of personal names in most cultures  @xcite , the numbers of papers scientists write  @xcite , the number of citations received by papers  @xcite , the number of hits on web pages  @xcite , the sales of books , music recordings and almost every other branded commodity  @xcite , the numbers of species in biological taxa  @xcite , people s annual incomes  @xcite and a host of other variables all follow power - law distributions .",
    "law for gravity has a power - law form with exponent  @xmath12 . while such laws are certainly interesting in their own way , they are not the topic of this paper .",
    "thus , for instance , there has in recent years been some discussion of the `` allometric '' scaling laws seen in the physiognomy and physiology of biological organisms  @xcite , but since these are not statistical distributions they will not be discussed here . ]",
    "power - law distributions are the subject of this article . in the following sections ,",
    "i discuss ways of detecting power - law behaviour , give empirical evidence for power laws in a variety of systems and describe some of the mechanisms by which power - law behaviour can arise .",
    "readers interested in pursuing the subject further may also wish to consult the reviews by sornette  @xcite and mitzenmacher  @xcite , as well as the bibliography by li .",
    "identifying power - law behaviour in either natural or man - made systems can be tricky .",
    "the standard strategy makes use of a result we have already seen : a histogram of a quantity with a power - law distribution appears as a straight line when plotted on logarithmic scales . just making a simple histogram , however , and plotting it on log scales to see if it looks straight is , in most cases , a poor way proceed .",
    "consider fig .",
    "this example shows a fake data set : i have generated a million random real numbers drawn from a power - law probability distribution @xmath13 with exponent @xmath14 , just for illustrative purposes .",
    "uniformly distributed in the range @xmath15 , then @xmath16 is a random power - law - distributed real number in the range @xmath17 with exponent  @xmath6 .",
    "note that there has to be a lower limit @xmath18 on the range ; the power - law distribution diverges as @xmath19see section  [ secexamples ] . ]",
    "panel  ( a ) of the figure shows a normal histogram of the numbers , produced by binning them into bins of equal size  @xmath20 .",
    "that is , the first bin goes from @xmath21 to  @xmath22 , the second from @xmath22 to  @xmath23 , and so forth . on the linear scales used this produces a nice smooth curve .    to reveal the power - law form of the distribution it is better , as we have seen , to plot the histogram on logarithmic scales , and when we do this for the current data we see the characteristic straight - line form of the power - law distribution , fig .",
    "[ fake]b . however , the plot is in some respects not a very good one .",
    "in particular the right - hand end of the distribution is noisy because of sampling errors .",
    "the power - law distribution dwindles in this region , meaning that each bin only has a few samples in it , if any .",
    "so the fractional fluctuations in the bin counts are large and this appears as a noisy curve on the plot . one way to deal with this",
    "would be simply to throw out the data in the tail of the curve .",
    "but there is often useful information in those data and furthermore , as we will see in section  [ secexamples ] , many distributions follow a power law _ only _ in the tail , so we are in danger of throwing out the baby with the bathwater .",
    "an alternative solution is to vary the width of the bins in the histogram .",
    "if we are going to do this , we must also normalize the sample counts by the width of the bins they fall in .",
    "that is , the number of samples in a bin of width  @xmath24 should be divided by @xmath24 to get a count _ per unit interval _ of  @xmath3 .",
    "then the normalized sample count becomes independent of bin width on average and we are free to vary the bin widths as we like .",
    "the most common choice is to create bins such that each is a fixed multiple wider than the one before it .",
    "this is known as logarithmic binning . for the present example",
    ", for instance , we might choose a multiplier of  2 and create bins that span the intervals 1 to @xmath22 , @xmath22 to @xmath25 , @xmath25 to @xmath26 and so forth ( i.e. ,  the sizes of the bins are @xmath20 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and so forth ) .",
    "this means the bins in the tail of the distribution get more samples than they would if bin sizes were fixed , and this reduces the statistical errors in the tail .",
    "it also has the nice side - effect that the bins appear to be of constant width when we plot the histogram on log scales .",
    "i used logarithmic binning in the construction of fig .",
    "[ cities]b , which is why the points representing the individual bins appear equally spaced . in fig .",
    "[ fake]c i have done the same for our computer - generated power - law data . as we can see , the straight - line power - law form of the histogram is now much clearer and can be seen to extend for at least a decade further than was apparent in fig .",
    "[ fake]b .",
    "even with logarithmic binning there is still some noise in the tail , although it is sharply decreased .",
    "suppose the bottom of the lowest bin is at @xmath18 and the ratio of the widths of successive bins is  @xmath29 .",
    "then the @xmath30th bin extends from @xmath31 to @xmath32 and the expected number of samples falling in this interval is @xmath33 thus , so long as @xmath34 , the number of samples per bin goes down as @xmath30 increases and the bins in the tail will have more statistical noise than those that precede them . as we will see in the next section , most power - law distributions occurring in nature have @xmath35 , so noisy tails are the norm .",
    "another , and in many ways a superior , method of plotting the data is to calculate a cumulative distribution function . instead of plotting a simple histogram of the data",
    ", we make a plot of the probability  @xmath36 that @xmath3 has a value greater than or equal to  @xmath3 : @xmath37 the plot we get is no longer a simple representation of the distribution of the data , but it is useful nonetheless . if the distribution follows a power law @xmath13 , then @xmath38 thus the cumulative distribution function  @xmath36 also follows a power law , but with a different exponent @xmath39 , which is 1 less than the original exponent .",
    "thus , if we plot @xmath36 on logarithmic scales we should again get a straight line , but with a shallower slope .",
    "but notice that there is no need to bin the data at all to calculate  @xmath36 . by its definition ,",
    "@xmath36  is well - defined for every value of  @xmath3 and so can be plotted as a perfectly normal function without binning .",
    "this avoids all questions about what sizes the bins should be .",
    "it also makes much better use of the data : binning of data lumps all samples within a given range together into the same bin and so throws out any information that was contained in the individual values of the samples within that range .",
    "cumulative distributions do nt throw away any information ; it s all there in the plot .",
    "figure  [ fake]d shows our computer - generated power - law data as a cumulative distribution , and indeed we again see the tell - tale straight - line form of the power law , but with a shallower slope than before . cumulative distributions like this are sometimes also called rank / frequency plots for reasons explained in appendix  [ rfappendix ] .",
    "cumulative distributions with a power - law form are sometimes said to follow zipf s law or a pareto distribution , after two early researchers who championed their study . since power - law",
    "cumulative distributions imply a power - law form for  @xmath11 , `` zipf s law '' and `` pareto distribution '' are effectively synonymous with `` power - law distribution '' .",
    "( zipf s law and the pareto distribution differ from one another in the way the cumulative distribution is plotted  zipf made his plots with @xmath3 on the horizontal axis and @xmath36 on the vertical one ; pareto did it the other way around .",
    "this causes much confusion in the literature , but the data depicted in the plots are of course identical . )    we know the value of the exponent @xmath6 for our artificial data set since it was generated deliberately to have a particular value , but in practical situations we would often like to estimate  @xmath6 from observed data .",
    "one way to do this would be to fit the slope of the line in plots like figs .",
    "[ fake]b , c or  d , and this is the most commonly used method .",
    "unfortunately , it is known to introduce systematic biases into the value of the exponent  @xcite , so it should not be relied upon . for example , a least - squares fit of a straight line to fig .",
    "[ fake]b gives @xmath40 , which is clearly incompatible with the known value of @xmath14 from which the data were generated .",
    "an alternative , simple and reliable method for extracting the exponent is to employ the formula @xmath41^{-1}. \\label{mle}\\ ] ] here the quantities @xmath42 , @xmath43 are the measured values of  @xmath3 and @xmath18 is again the minimum value of  @xmath3 .",
    "( as discussed in the following section , in practical situations @xmath18  usually corresponds not to the smallest value of @xmath3 measured but to the smallest for which the power - law behaviour holds . )",
    "an estimate of the expected statistical error  @xmath44 on  ( [ mle ] ) is given by @xmath45^{-1 }    = { \\alpha-1\\over\\sqrt{n}}. \\label{mleerror}\\ ] ] the derivation of both these formulas is given in appendix  [ mlmethod ] .",
    "applying eqs .",
    "( [ mle ] ) and  ( [ mleerror ] ) to our present data gives an estimate of @xmath46 for the exponent , which agrees well with the known value of @xmath47 .      in fig .",
    "[ examples ] we show cumulative distributions of twelve different quantities measured in physical , biological , technological and social systems of various kinds .",
    "all have been proposed to follow power laws over some part of their range .",
    "the ubiquity of power - law behaviour in the natural world has led many scientists to wonder whether there is a single , simple , underlying mechanism linking all these different systems together .",
    "several candidates for such mechanisms have been proposed , going by names like `` self - organized criticality '' and `` highly optimized tolerance '' . however , the conventional wisdom is that there are actually many different mechanisms for producing power laws and that different ones are applicable to different cases .",

    "power - law distributions are , as we have seen , impressively ubiquitous , but they are not the only form of broad distribution .",
    "lest i give the impression that everything interesting follows a power law , let me emphasize that there are quite a number of quantities with highly right - skewed distributions that nonetheless do not obey power laws .",
    "a few of them , shown in fig .",
    "[ nonpl ] , are the following :    1 .   the abundance of north american bird species , which spans over five orders of magnitude but is probably distributed according to a log - normal .",
    "a log - normally distributed quantity is one whose logarithm is normally distributed ; see section  [ sundry ] and ref .",
    "@xcite for further discussions .",
    "2 .   the number of entries in people s email address books , which spans about three orders of magnitude but seems to follow a stretched exponential . a stretched",
    "exponential is curve of the form @xmath56 for some constants @xmath57 .",
    "3 .   the distribution of the sizes of forest fires , which spans six orders of magnitude and could follow a power law but with an exponential cutoff .",
    "this being an article about power laws , i will not discuss further the possible explanations for these distributions , but the scientist confronted with a new set of data having a broad dynamic range and a highly skewed distribution should certainly bear in mind that a power - law model is only one of several possibilities for fitting it .",

    "indeed we can and necessarily we will always get a finite number from the calculation , since each individual measurement  @xmath3 is itself a finite number and there are a finite number of them .",
    "only if we had a truly infinite number of samples would we see the mean actually diverge .    however , if we were to repeat our finite experiment many times and calculate the mean for each repetition , then the mean of those many means is itself also formally divergent , since it is simply equal to the mean we would calculate if all the repetitions were combined into one large experiment .",
    "this implies that , while the mean may take a relatively small value on any particular repetition of the experiment , it must occasionally take a huge value , in order that the overall mean diverge as the number of repetitions does .",
    "thus there must be very large fluctuations in the value of the mean , and this is what the divergence in eq .",

    "this fact is more than just a curiosity . as we will see in section  [ critphen ] , there are some systems that become scale - free for certain special values of their governing parameters . the point defined by such a special value",
    "is called a `` continuous phase transition '' and the argument given above implies that at such a point the observable quantities in the system should adopt a power - law distribution .",
    "this indeed is seen experimentally and the distributions so generated provided the original motivation for the study of power laws in physics ( although most experimentally observed power laws are probably not the result of phase transitions  a variety of other mechanisms produce power - law behaviour as well , as we will shortly see ) .",
    "so far i have focused on power - law distributions for continuous real variables , but many of the quantities we deal with in practical situations are in fact discrete  usually integers . for instance",
    ", populations of cities , numbers of citations to papers or numbers of copies of books sold are all integer quantities . in most cases ,",
    "the distinction is not very important .",
    "the power law is obeyed only in the tail of the distribution where the values measured are so large that , to all intents and purposes , they can be considered continuous .",
    "technically however , power - law distributions should be defined slightly differently for integer quantities .",
    "if @xmath30 is an integer variable , then one way to proceed is to declare that it follows a power law if the probability  @xmath128 of measuring the value  @xmath30 obeys @xmath129 for some constant exponent  @xmath6 .",
    "clearly this distribution can not hold all the way down to @xmath130 , since it diverges there , but it could in theory hold down to @xmath131 .",

    "the yule distribution is nice because sums involving it can frequently be performed in closed form , where sums involving eq .",
    "( [ discrete ] ) can only be written in terms of special functions .",

    "in this section we look at possible candidate mechanisms by which power - law distributions might arise in natural and man - made systems .",
    "some of the possibilities that have been suggested are quite complex  notably the physics of critical phenomena and the tools of the renormalization group that are used to analyse it . but let us start with some simple algebraic methods of generating power - law functions and progress to the more involved mechanisms later .      a much more common distribution than the power law is the exponential , which arises in many circumstances , such as survival times for decaying atomic nuclei or the boltzmann distribution of energies in statistical mechanics .",
    "suppose some quantity @xmath146 has an exponential distribution : @xmath147 the constant  @xmath29 might be either negative or positive . if it is positive then there must also be a cutoff on the distribution  a limit on the maximum value of  @xmath146so that the distribution is normalizable .",

    "this is a reasonable theory as far as it goes , but real text is not made up of random letters .",
    "most combinations of letters do nt occur in natural languages ; most are not even pronounceable .",
    "we might imagine that some constant fraction of possible letter sequences of a given length would correspond to real words and the argument above would then work just fine when applied to that fraction , but upon reflection this suggestion is obviously bogus .",

    "there may still be some merit in miller s argument however",
    ". the problem may be that we are measuring word `` length '' in the wrong units .",
    "letters are not really the basic units of language . some basic units are letters , but some are groups of letters .",
    "the letters `` th '' for example often occur together in english and make a single sound , so perhaps they should be considered to be a separate symbol in their own right and contribute only one unit to the word length ?",
    "following this idea to its logical conclusion we can imagine replacing each fundamental unit of the language  whatever that is  by its own symbol and then measuring lengths in terms of numbers of symbols",
    ". the pursuit of ideas along these lines led claude shannon in the 1940s to develop the field of information theory , which gives a precise prescription for calculating the number of symbols necessary to transmit words or any other data  @xcite .",
    "the units of information are bits and the true `` length '' of a word can be considered to be the number of bits of information it carries .",
    "shannon showed that if we regard words as the basic divisions of a message , the information  @xmath146 carried by any particular word is @xmath163 where @xmath3 is the frequency of the word as before and @xmath30 is a constant .",
    "( the reader interested in finding out more about where this simple relation comes from is recommended to look at the excellent introduction to information theory by cover and thomas  @xcite . )    but this has precisely the form that we want .",
    "inverting it we have @xmath164 and if the probability distribution of the `` lengths '' measured in terms of bits is also exponential as in eq .",

    "so @xmath215 new species appear for each new genus and there are @xmath215 species per genus on average . )",
    "thus the number of genera goes up steadily in this model , as does the number of species within each genus .",
    "we can analyse this yule process mathematically as follows .",
    "let us measure the passage of time in the model by the number of genera  @xmath55 . at each time - step one new species founds a new genus , thereby increasing @xmath55 by  1 , and @xmath153 other species are added to various pre - existing genera which are selected in proportion to the number of species they already have .",
    "we denote by @xmath216 the fraction of genera that have @xmath30 species when the total number of genera is  @xmath55 .",
    "thus the _ number _ of such genera is  @xmath217 .",
    "we now ask what the probability is that the next species added to the system happens to be added to a particular genus  @xmath78 having @xmath218 species in it already . this probability is proportional to  @xmath218 , and so when properly normalized is just @xmath219 . but",
    "@xmath220 is simply the total number of species , which is @xmath221 .",

    "the total expected number of genera of size  @xmath30 that gain a new species in the same interval is @xmath224    now we observe that the number of genera with @xmath30 species will decrease on each time step by exactly this number , since by gaining a new species they become genera with @xmath225 instead . at the same time",
    "the number _ increases _ because of species that previously had @xmath226 species and now have an extra one .",

    "now we ask what form the distribution of the sizes of genera takes in the limit of long times .",
    "to do this we allow @xmath210 and assume that the distribution tends to some fixed value @xmath230 independent of  @xmath55 .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ yule2 ] ) becomes @xmath231 , which has the solution @xmath232 and eq .",

    "this , we note , is precisely the distribution defined in eq .",
    "( [ yuledist ] ) , which simon called the yule distribution . since the beta - function has a power - law tail @xmath91 , we can immediately see that @xmath128 also has a power - law tail with an exponent @xmath239 the mean number @xmath215 of species per genus for the example of flowering plants is about  3 , making @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",
    "the actual exponent for the distribution found by willis and yule  @xcite is @xmath242 , which is in excellent agreement with the theory .",
    "most likely this agreement is fortuitous , however .",
    "the yule process is probably not a terribly realistic explanation for the distribution of the sizes of genera , principally because it ignores the fact that species ( and genera ) become extinct .",
    "however , it has been adapted and generalized by others to explain power laws in many other systems , most famously city sizes  @xcite , paper citations  @xcite , and links to pages on the world wide web  @xcite .",
    "the most general form of the yule process is as follows .",
    "suppose we have a system composed of a collection of objects , such as genera , cities , papers , web pages and so forth .",
    "new objects appear every once in a while as cities grow up or people publish new papers .",
    "each object also has some property  @xmath30 associated with it , such as number of species in a genus , people in a city or citations to a paper , that is reputed to obey a power law , and it is this power law that we wish to explain .",
    "newly appearing objects have some initial value of @xmath30 which we will denote  @xmath243 .",
    "new genera initially have only a single species @xmath244 , but new towns or cities might have quite a large initial population ",
    "a single person living in a house somewhere is unlikely to constitute a town in their own right but @xmath245 people might do so .",
    "the value of @xmath243 can also be zero in some cases : newly published papers usually have zero citations for instance .    in between the appearance of one object and the next , @xmath153  new species / people / citations etc .",
    "are added to the entire system .",
    "that is some cities or papers will get new people or citations , but not necessarily all will . and in the simplest case these are added to objects in proportion to the number that the object already has .",
    "thus the probability of a city gaining a new member is proportional to the number already there ; the probability of a paper getting a new citation is proportional to the number it already has . in many cases",
    "this seems like a natural process .",
    "for example , a paper that already has many citations is more likely to be discovered during a literature search and hence more likely to be cited again .",
    "simon  @xcite dubbed this type of `` rich - get - richer '' process the gibrat principle .",
    "elsewhere it also goes by the names of the matthew effect  @xcite , cumulative advantage  @xcite , or preferential attachment  @xcite .",
    "there is a problem however when @xmath246 .",
    "for example , if new papers appear with no citations and garner citations in proportion to the number they currently have , which is zero , then no paper will ever get any citations ! to overcome this problem one typically assigns new citations not in proportion simply to  @xmath30 , but to @xmath247 , where @xmath7 is some constant .",
    "thus there are three parameters @xmath243 , @xmath7 and  @xmath153 that control the behaviour of the model .    by an argument exactly analogous to the one given above",

    "( [ yuleexponent ] ) . for citations of papers or links",

    "the measured exponent for numbers of links to web sites is about @xmath269 , so if the yule process is to match the data in this case , we should put @xmath270 .    however , the important point is that the yule process is a plausible and general mechanism that can explain a number of the power - law distributions observed in nature and can produce a wide range of exponents to match the observations by suitable adjustments of the parameters . for several of the distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ examples ] , especially citations , city populations and personal income , it is now the most widely accepted theory .",
    "a completely different mechanism for generating power laws , one that has received a huge amount of attention over the past few decades from the physics community , is that of critical phenomena .",
    "some systems have only a single macroscopic length - scale , size - scale or time - scale governing them .",
    "a classic example is a magnet , which has a correlation length that measures the typical size of magnetic domains . under certain circumstances",
    "this length - scale can diverge , leaving the system with no scale at all .",
    "as we will now see , such a system is `` scale - free '' in the sense of section  [ secsf ] and hence the distributions of macroscopic physical quantities have to follow power laws .",
    "usually the circumstances under which the divergence takes place are very specific ones .",
    "the parameters of the system have to be tuned very precisely to produce the power - law behaviour .",
    "this is something of a disadvantage ; it makes the divergence of length - scales an unlikely explanation for generic power - law distributions of the type highlighted in this paper .",
    "as we will shortly see , however , there are some elegant and interesting ways around this problem .    the precise point at which the length - scale in a system diverges is called a critical point or a phase transition .",
    "more specifically it is a continuous phase transition .",
    "( there are other kinds of phase transitions too . )",
    "things that happen in the vicinity of continuous phase transitions are known as critical phenomena , of which power - law distributions are one example .    to better understand the physics of critical phenomena ,",
    "let us explore one simple but instructive example , that of the `` percolation transition '' .",
    "consider a square lattice like the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ percsmall ] in which some of the squares have been coloured in .",
    "suppose we colour each square with independent probability  @xmath121 , so that on average a fraction  @xmath121 of them are coloured in .",
    "now we look at the clusters of coloured squares that form , i.e. ,  the contiguous regions of adjacent coloured squares .",
    "we can ask , for instance , what the mean area  @xmath271 is of the cluster to which a randomly chosen square belongs .",
    "if that square is not coloured in then the area is zero .",
    "if it is coloured in but none of the adjacent ones is coloured in then the area is one , and so forth .",
    "when @xmath121 is small , only a few squares are coloured in and most coloured squares will be alone on the lattice , or maybe grouped in twos or threes . so @xmath271 will be small .",
    "this situation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ percolation ] for @xmath272 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath121 is large  almost  1 , which is the largest value it can have  then most squares will be coloured in and they will almost all be connected together in one large cluster , the so - called spanning cluster . in this situation",
    "we say that the system percolates . now",
    "the mean size of the cluster to which a vertex belongs is limited only by the size of the lattice itself and as we let the lattice size become large @xmath271 also becomes large .",
    "so we have two distinctly different behaviours , one for small  @xmath121 in which @xmath271 is small and does nt depend on the size of the system , and one for large  @xmath121 in which @xmath271 is much larger and increases with the size of the system .",
    "and what happens in between these two extremes ? as we increase @xmath121 from small values , the value of @xmath271 also increases .",
    "but at some point we reach the start of the regime in which @xmath271 goes up with system size instead of staying constant .",
    "we now know that this point is at @xmath273 , which is called the critical value of  @xmath121 and is denoted  @xmath274 .",
    "if the size of the lattice is large , then @xmath271 also becomes large at this point , and in the limit where the lattice size goes to infinity @xmath271  actually diverges . to illustrate this phenomenon ,",
    "i show in fig .",
    "[ divergence ] a plot of @xmath271 from simulations of the percolation model and the divergence is clear .",
    "now consider not just the mean cluster size but the entire distribution of cluster sizes .",
    "let @xmath275 be the probability that a randomly chosen square belongs to a cluster of area  @xmath276 .",
    "in general , what forms can @xmath275 take as a function of  @xmath276 ? the important point to notice",
    "is that  @xmath275 , being a probability distribution , is a dimensionless quantity  just a number  but @xmath276 is an area",
    ". we could measure  @xmath276 in terms of square metres , or whatever units the lattice is calibrated in . the average  @xmath271 is also an area and then there is the area of a unit square itself , which we will denote  @xmath29 .",
    "other than these three quantities , however , there are no other independent parameters with dimensions in this problem .",
    "( there is the area of the whole lattice , but we are considering the limit where that becomes infinite , so it s out of the picture . )    if we want to make a dimensionless function @xmath275 out of these three dimensionful parameters , there are three dimensionless ratios we can form : @xmath277 , @xmath278 and @xmath279 ( or their reciprocals , if we prefer ) .",
    "only two of these are independent however , since the last is the product of the other two .",
    "thus in general we can write @xmath280 where @xmath281 is a dimensionless mathematical function of its dimensionless arguments and @xmath10 is a normalizing constant chosen so that @xmath282 .",
    "but now here s the trick .",
    "we can coarse - grain or rescale our lattice so that the fundamental unit of the lattice changes .",
    "for instance , we could double the size of our unit square  @xmath29 .",
    "the kind of picture i m thinking of is shown in fig .",
    "[ rescale ] .",
    "the basic percolation clusters stay roughly the same size and shape , although i ve had to fudge things around the edges a bit to make it work . for this reason",
    "this argument will only be strictly correct for large clusters  @xmath276 whose area is not changed appreciably by the fudging .",
    "( and the argument thus only tells us that the tail of the distribution is a power law , and not the whole distribution . )    the probability  @xmath275 of getting a cluster of area  @xmath276 is unchanged by the coarse - graining since the areas themselves are , to a good approximation , unchanged , and the mean cluster size is thus also unchanged .",
    "all that has changed , mathematically speaking , is that the unit area @xmath29 has been rescaled @xmath283 for some constant rescaling factor  @xmath90 .",
    "the equivalent of eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) in our coarse - grained system is @xmath284 comparing with eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) , we can see that this is equal , to within a multiplicative constant , to the probability @xmath285 of getting a cluster of size  @xmath286 , but in a system with a different mean cluster size of @xmath287 .",
    "thus we have related the probabilities of two different sizes of clusters to one another , but on systems with different average cluster size and hence presumably also different site occupation probability .",
    "note that the normalization constant must in general be changed in eq .",
    "( [ eqrescale ] ) to make sure that @xmath275 still sums to unity , and that this change will depend on the value we choose for the rescaling factor  @xmath90 .",
    "but now we notice that there is one special point at which this rescaling by definition does not result in a change in @xmath271 or a corresponding change in the site occupation probability , and that is the critical point .",
    "when we are precisely at the point at which @xmath288 , then @xmath289 by definition .",
    "putting @xmath288 in eqs .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) and  ( [ eqrescale ] ) , we then get @xmath290 . or equivalently @xmath291 where @xmath292 .",
    "comparing with eq .",
    "( [ scalefree ] ) we see that this has precisely the form of the equation that defines a scale - free distribution . the rest of the derivation below eq .",
    "( [ scalefree ] ) follows immediately , and so we know that @xmath275 must follow a power law .",
    "this in fact is the origin of the name `` scale - free '' for a distribution of the form  ( [ scalefree ] ) . at the point at which @xmath271 diverges",
    ", the system is left with no defining size - scale , other than the unit of area  @xmath29 itself .",
    "it is `` scale - free '' , and by the argument above it follows that the distribution of @xmath276 must obey a power law .    in fig .",
    "[ pcdist ] i show an example of a cumulative distribution of cluster sizes for a percolation system right at the critical point and , as the figure shows , the distribution does indeed follow a power law .",
    "technically the distribution can not follow a power law to arbitrarily large cluster sizes since the area of a cluster can be no bigger than the area of the whole lattice , so the power - law distribution will be cut off in the tail .",
    "this is an example of a finite - size effect .",
    "this point does not seem to be visible in fig .",
    "[ pcdist ] however .",
    "the kinds of arguments given in this section can be made more precise using the machinery of the renormalization group .",
    "the real - space renormalization group makes use precisely of transformations such as that shown in fig .",
    "[ rescale ] to derive power - law forms and their exponents for distributions at the critical point .",
    "an example application to the percolation problem is given by reynolds  _ et  al . _",
    "a more technically sophisticated technique is the @xmath30-space renormalization group , which makes use of transformations in fourier space to accomplish similar aims in a particularly elegant formal environment  @xcite .",
    "as discussed in the preceding section , certain systems develop power - law distributions at special `` critical '' points in their parameter space because of the divergence of some characteristic scale , such as the mean cluster size in the percolation model .",
    "this does not , however , provide a plausible explanation for the origin of power laws in most real systems .",
    "even if we could come up with some model of earthquakes or solar flares or web hits that had such a divergence , it seems unlikely that the parameters of the real world would , just coincidentally , fall precisely at the point where the divergence occurred .",
    "as first proposed by bak  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite , however , it is possible that some dynamical systems actually arrange themselves so that they always sit at the critical point , no matter what state we start off in .",
    "one says that such systems self - organize to the critical point , or that they display self - organized criticality .",
    "a now - classic example of such a system is the forest fire model of drossel and schwabl  @xcite , which is based on the percolation model we have already seen .",
    "consider the percolation model as a primitive model of a forest .",
    "the lattice represents the landscape and a single tree can grow in each square .",
    "occupied squares represent trees and empty squares represent empty plots of land with no trees .",
    "trees appear instantaneously at random at some constant rate and hence the squares of the lattice fill up at random .",
    "every once in a while a wildfire starts at a random square on the lattice , set off by a lightning strike perhaps , and burns the tree in that square , if there is one , along with every other tree in the cluster connected to it .",
    "the process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ffmodel ] .",
    "one can think of the fire as leaping from tree to adjacent tree until the whole cluster is burned , but the fire can not cross the firebreak formed by an empty square .",
    "if there is no tree in the square struck by the lightning , then nothing happens .",
    "after a fire , trees can grow up again in the squares vacated by burnt trees , so the process keeps going indefinitely .",
    "if we start with an empty lattice , trees will start to appear but will initially be sparse and lightning strikes will either hit empty squares or if they do chance upon a tree they will burn it and its cluster , but that cluster will be small and localized because we are well below the percolation threshold . thus fires will have essentially no effect on the forest .",
    "as time goes by however , more and more trees will grow up until at some point there are enough that we have percolation . at that point , as we have seen , a spanning cluster forms whose size is limited only by the size of the lattice , and when any tree in that cluster gets hit by the lightning the entire cluster will burn away .",
    "this gets rid of the spanning cluster so that the system does not percolate any more , but over time as more trees appear it will presumably reach percolation again , and so the scenario will play out repeatedly .",
    "the end result is that the system oscillates right around the critical point , first going just above the percolation threshold as trees appear and then being beaten back below it by fire . in the limit of large system size these fluctuations become small compared to the size of the system as a whole and to an excellent approximation the system just sits at the threshold indefinitely .",
    "thus , if we wait long enough , we expect the forest fire model to self - organize to a state in which it has a power - law distribution of the sizes of clusters , or of the sizes of fires .    in fig .",
    "[ ffdist ] i show the cumulative distribution of the sizes of fires in the forest fire model and , as we can see , it follows a power law closely .",
    "the exponent of the distribution is quite small in this case .",
    "the best current estimates give a value of @xmath293  @xcite , meaning that the distribution has an infinite mean in the limit of large system size .",
    "for all real systems however the mean is finite : the distribution is cut off in the large - size tail because fires can not have a size any greater than that of the lattice as a whole and this makes the mean well - behaved .",
    "this cutoff is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ ffdist ] as the drop in the curve towards the right of the plot . what s more the distribution of the sizes of fires in real forests , fig .",
    "[ nonpl]d , shows a similar cutoff and is in many ways qualitatively similar to the distribution predicted by the model .",
    "( real forests are obviously vastly more complex than the forest fire model , and no one is seriously suggesting that the model is an accurate representation the real world . rather it is a guide to the general type of processes that might be going on in forests . )    there has been much excitement about self - organized criticality as a possible generic mechanism for explaining where power - law distributions come from . per bak , one of the originators of the idea , wrote an entire book about it  @xcite .",
    "self - organized critical models have been put forward not only for forest fires , but for earthquakes  @xcite , solar flares  @xcite , biological evolution  @xcite , avalanches  @xcite and many other phenomena . although it is probably not the universal law that some have claimed it to be , it is certainly a powerful and intriguing concept that potentially has applications to a variety of natural and man - made systems .      in the preceding sections i ve described the best known and most widely applied mechanisms that generate power - law distributions . however , there are a number of others that deserve a mention .",
    "one that has been receiving some attention recently is the highly optimized tolerance mechanism of carlson and doyle  @xcite .",
    "the classic example of this mechanism is again a model of forest fires and is based on the percolation process .",
    "suppose again that fires start at random in a grid - like forest , just as we considered in sec .",
    "[ soc ] , but suppose now that instead of appearing at random , trees are deliberately planted by a knowledgeable forester .",
    "one can ask what the best distribution of trees is to optimize the amount of lumber the forest produces , subject to random fires that could start at any place .",
    "the answer turns out to be that one should plant trees in blocks , with narrow firebreaks between them to prevent fires from spreading .",
    "moreover , one should make the blocks smaller in regions where fires start more often and larger where fires are rare .",
    "the reason for this is that we waste some valuable space by making firebreaks , space in which we could have planted more trees .",
    "if fires are rare , then on average it pays to put the breaks further apart  more trees will burn if there is a fire , but we also get more lumber if there is nt .",
    "carlson and doyle show both by analytic arguments and by numerical simulation that for quite general distributions of starting points for fires this process leads to a distribution of fire sizes that approximately follows a power law .",
    "the distribution is not a perfect power law in this case , but on the other hand neither are many of those seen in the data of fig .",
    "[ examples ] , so this is not necessarily a disadvantage .",
    "carlson and doyle have proposed that highly optimized tolerance could be a model not only for forest fires but also for the sizes of files on the world wide web , which appear to follow a power law  @xcite .",
    "another mechanism , which is mathematically similar to that of carlson and doyle but quite different in motivation , is the coherent noise mechanism proposed by sneppen and newman  @xcite as a model of biological extinction . in this mechanism",
    "a number of agents or species are subjected to stresses of various sizes , and each agent has a threshold for stress above which an applied stress will wipe that agent out ",
    "the species becomes extinct .",
    "extinct species are replaced by new ones with randomly chosen thresholds .",
    "the net result is that the system self - organizes to a state where most of the surviving species have high thresholds , but the exact distribution depends on the distribution of stresses in a way very similar to the relation between block sizes and fire frequency in highly optimized tolerance .",
    "no conscious optimization is needed in this case , but the end result is similar : the overall distribution of the numbers of species becoming extinct as a result of any particular stress approximately follows a power law .",
    "the power - law form is not exact , but it s as good as that seen in real extinction data .",
    "sneppen and newman have also suggested that their mechanism could be used to model avalanches and earthquakes .",
    "one of the broad distributions mentioned in sec .",
    "[ secnonpl ] as an alternative to the power law was the log - normal .",
    "a log - normally distributed quantity is one whose logarithm is normally distributed .",
    "that is @xmath294 for some choice of the mean  @xmath295 and standard deviation  @xmath44 of the distribution .",
    "distributions like this typically arise when we are multiplying together random numbers .",
    "the log of the product of a large number of random numbers is the sum of the logarithms of those same random numbers , and by the central limit theorem such sums have a normal distribution essentially regardless of the distribution of the individual numbers .",
    "but eq .  ( [ lognormal ] ) implies that the distribution of  @xmath3 itself is @xmath296 to see how this looks if we were to plot it on log scales , we take logarithms of both sides , giving @xmath297 \\ln x               - { \\mu^2\\over2\\sigma^2 } , \\label{lnquad}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is quadratic in  @xmath298 . however , any quadratic curve looks straight if we view a sufficient small portion of it , so @xmath11 will look like a power - law distribution when we look at a small portion on log scales .",
    "the effective exponent  @xmath6 of the distribution is in this case not fixed by the theory  it could be anything , depending on which part of the quadratic our data fall on .",
    "on larger scales the distribution will have some downward curvature , but so do many of the distributions claimed to follow power laws , so it is possible that these distributions are really log - normal .",
    "in fact , in many cases we do nt even have to restrict ourselves to a particularly small a portion of the curve . if @xmath44 is large then the quadratic term in eq .",
    "( [ lnquad ] ) will vary slowly and the curvature of the line will be slight , so the distribution will appear to follow a power law over relatively large portions of its range .",

    ",  the numbers themselves vary up or down by about a factor of  @xmath299 . then , by the central limit theorem , the standard deviation for  @xmath298 will be @xmath300 and @xmath298 will have to vary by about @xmath301 for changes in @xmath302 to be apparent .",
    "but such a variation in the logarithm corresponds to a variation in @xmath3 of more than four orders of magnitude . if our data span a domain smaller than this , as many of the plots in fig .",
    "[ examples ] do , then we will see a measured distribution that looks close to power - law . and",
    "the range will get quickly larger as the number of numbers we are multiplying grows .",
    "one example of a random multiplicative process might be wealth generation by investment .",
    "if a person invests money , for instance in the stock market , they will get a percentage return on their investment that varies over time .",
    "in other words , in each period of time their investment is multiplied by some factor which fluctuates from one period to the next .",
    "if the fluctuations are random and uncorrelated , then after many such periods the value of the investment is the initial value multiplied by the product of a large number of random numbers , and therefore should be distributed according to a log - normal .",
    "this could explain why the tail of the wealth distribution , fig .",
    "[ examples]j , appears to follow a power law .",
    "another example is fragmentation .",
    "suppose we break a stick of unit length into two parts at a position which is a random fraction  @xmath303 of the way along the stick s length .",
    "then we break the resulting pieces at random again and so on .",
    "after many breaks , the length of one of the remaining pieces will be @xmath304 , where @xmath305 is the position of the @xmath78th break .",
    "this is a product of random numbers and thus the resulting distribution of lengths should follow a power law over a portion of its range .",
    "a mechanism like this could , for instance , produce a power - law distribution of meteors or other interplanetary rock fragments , which tend to break up when they collide with one another , and this in turn could produce a power - law distribution of the sizes of meteor craters similar to the one in fig .",
    "[ examples]g .",
    "in fact , as discussed by a number of authors  @xcite , random multiplication processes can also generate perfect power - law distributions with only a slight modification : if there is a lower bound on the value that the product of a set of numbers is allowed to take ( for example if there is a `` reflecting boundary '' on the lower end of the range , or an additive noise term as well as a multiplicative one ) then the behaviour of the process is modified to generate not a log - normal , but a true power law .    finally , some processes show power - law distributions of times between events .",
    "the distribution of times between earthquakes and their aftershocks is one example .",
    "such power - law distributions of times are observed in critical models and in the coherent noise mechanism mentioned above , but another possible explanation for their occurrence is a random extremal process or record dynamics . in this mechanism",
    "we consider how often a randomly fluctuating quantity will break its own record for the highest value recorded . for a quantity with , say , a gaussian distribution",
    ", it is always in theory possible for the record to be broken , no matter what its current value , but the more often the record is broken the higher the record will get and the longer we will have to wait until it is broken again . as shown by sibani and littlewood  @xcite , this non - stationary process gives a distribution of waiting times between the establishment of new records that follows a power law with exponent  @xmath306 .",
    "interestingly , this is precisely the exponent observed for the distribution of waiting times for aftershocks of earthquakes .",
    "the record dynamics has also been proposed as a model for the lifetimes of biological taxa  @xcite .",
    "in this review i have discussed the power - law statistical distributions seen in a wide variety of natural and man - made phenomena , from earthquakes and solar flares to populations of cities and sales of books .",
    "we have seen many examples of power - law distributions in real data and seen how to analyse those data to understand the behaviour and parameters of the distributions .",
    "i  have also described a number of physical mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the occurrence of power laws . perhaps the two most important of these are :    1 .",
    "the yule process , a rich - get - richer mechanism in which the most populous cities or best - selling books get more inhabitants or sales in proportion to the number they already have .",
    "yule and later simon showed mathematically that this mechanism produces what is now called the yule distribution , which follows a power law in its tail .",
    "2 .   critical phenomena and the associated concept of self - organized criticality , in which a scale - factor of a system diverges , either because we have tuned the system to a special critical point in its parameter space or because the system automatically drives itself to that point by some dynamical process . the divergence can leave the system with no appropriate scale factor to set the size of some measured quantity and as we have seen the quantity must then follow a power law .",
    "the study of power - law distributions is an area in which there is considerable current research interest .",
    "while the mechanisms and explanations presented here certainly offer some insight , there is much work to be done both experimentally and theoretically before we can say we really understand the physical processes driving these systems . without doubt",
    "there are many exciting discoveries still waiting to be made .",
    "the author thanks jean - philippe bouchaud , petter holme , cris moore , cosma shalizi , eduardo sontag , didier sornette , and erik van nimwegen for useful conversations and suggestions , and lada adamic for the web site hit data .",
    "this work was funded in part by the national science foundation under grant number dms0405348 .",
    "suppose we wish to make a plot of the cumulative distribution function  @xmath36 of a quantity such as , for example , the frequency with which words appear in a body of text ( fig .",
    "[ examples]a ) .",
    "we start by making a list of all the words along with their frequency of occurrence .",
    "now the cumulative distribution of the frequency is defined such that @xmath36 is the fraction of words with frequency greater than or equal to  @xmath3 . or alternatively one could simply plot the _ number _ of words with frequency greater than or equal to  @xmath3 , which differs from the fraction only in its normalization .",
    "now consider the most frequent word , which is `` the '' in most written english texts .",
    "if @xmath3 is the frequency with which this word occurs , then clearly there is exactly one word with frequency greater than or equal to  @xmath3 , since no other word is more frequent .",
    "similarly , for the frequency of the second most common word  usually `` of''there are two words with that frequency or greater , namely `` of '' and `` the '' . and so forth .",
    "in other words , if we rank the words in order , then by definition there are @xmath55 words with frequency greater than or equal to that of the @xmath55th most common word .",
    "thus the cumulative distribution @xmath36 is simply proportional to the rank @xmath55 of a word .",
    "this means that to make a plot of @xmath36 all we need do is sort the words in decreasing order of frequency , number them starting from  1 , and then plot their ranks as a function of their frequency .",
    "such a plot of rank against frequency was called by zipf  @xcite a rank / frequency plot , and this name is still sometimes used to refer to plots of the cumulative distribution of a quantity . of course , many quantities we are interested in are not frequencies  they are the sizes of earthquakes or people s personal wealth or whatever  but nonetheless people still talk about `` rank / frequency '' plots although the name is not technically accurate .    in practice , sorting and ranking measurements and then plotting rank against those measurements is usually the quickest way to construct a plot of the cumulative distribution of a quantity .",
    "all the cumulative plots in this paper were made in this way , except for the plot of the sizes of moon craters in fig .",
    "[ examples]g , for which the data came already in cumulative form .",
    "consider the power - law distribution @xmath307 where we have made use of the value of the normalization constant  @xmath10 calculated in eq .",
    "( [ normc ] ) .      to find the value of  @xmath6 that best fits the data , we need to calculate the probability  @xmath309 of a particular value of @xmath6 given the observed  @xmath310 , which is related to @xmath311 by bayes law thus : @xmath312 the prior probability of the data @xmath36 is fixed since @xmath3 itself is fixed@xmath3  is equal to the particular set of observations we actually made and does not vary in the calculation  and it is usually assumed , in the absence of any information to the contrary , that the prior probability of the exponent @xmath313 is uniform , i.e. ,  a constant independent of  @xmath6 . thus @xmath314 . for convenience",
    "we typically work with the logarithm of  @xmath309 , which , to within an additive constant , is equal to the log of the likelihood , denoted  @xmath315 and given by @xmath316 \\nonumber\\\\      & = & n\\ln(\\alpha-1 ) - n\\ln x_\\mathrm{min }          - \\alpha \\sum_{i=1}^n \\ln { x_i\\over x_\\mathrm{min}}. \\label{loglikelihood}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we calculate the most likely value of @xmath6 by maximizing the likelihood with respect to  @xmath6 , which is the same as maximizing the log likelihood , since the logarithm is a monotonic increasing function . setting @xmath317 , we find @xmath318 or @xmath319^{-1}. \\label{appmle}\\ ] ]    we also wish to know what the expected error is on our value of  @xmath6 .",
    "we can estimate this from the width of the maximum of the likelihood as a function of  @xmath6 . taking the exponential of eq .",
