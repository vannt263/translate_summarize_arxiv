    "the bulk properties of qcd matter , as created in relativistic heavy ion collisions , largely manifest themselves in soft hadronic observables of particles with transverse momentum less than one gev/@xmath0 .",
    "these observables can be divided into three classes : spectra , flow ( or large - scale correlations ) , and correlations at small relative momentum .",
    "this last class is referred to as femtoscopy @xcite since these correlations are used to determine space - time characteristics of emitting sources .",
    "correlation functions , @xmath1 , can be linked to the outgoing phase - space distributions , or more precisely the source function @xmath2 , which describes the probability that two particles with the same velocity , whose total momentum is @xmath3 , are separated by @xmath4 in their asymptotic trajectory . due to their inherent six - dimensional nature",
    ", correlations have proven to be the most difficult of all rhic observables to fit with full dynamic models .",
    "the measurements are amenable to being fit by simple geometric models of the final state , provided that the models incorporate strong radial collective flow , and a rapid dissolution into a thermal assortment of resonances @xcite .",
    "however , many dynamic models , especially hybrid hydrodynamic / cascade descriptions , lead to more extended emission durations which lead to signicantly different shapes for the outgoing phase space distributions .    the information in correlations are often reduced to gaussian source parameters , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which are functions of the transverse momentum @xmath8 , and describe the shape of the outgoing phase - space distribution of zero - rapidity particles with a specific @xmath8 and a specific azimuthal angle . here",
    ", @xmath7 refers to the longitudinal dimension , along the beam axis , @xmath5 describes the outward dimension , parallel to the momentum , and @xmath6 refers to the sideward dimension , perpendicular to the beam and to the particle s velocity .",
    "asymptotically , the gaussian form fits the phase space density to the form , @xmath9 the term @xmath10 is irrelevant for identical particles since correlations are only sensitive to the relative position of two particles of the same velocity . for non - identical particles , one would also be sensitive to the relative position of centroids for the two species , @xmath11 .",
    "this study focuses on how these parameters are affected by choices made in modeling the reaction .",
    "the femtoscopic relation to the equation of state has long been studied .",
    "first , a stiffer equation of state leads to more rapid expansions , with emission at earlier times and more confined to a brief burst .",
    "the reduction in the mean emission time reduces @xmath7 as the system has less time to expand longitudinally before emission .",
    "the increased suddenness leads to a shorter @xmath5 relative to @xmath6 , as long - lived emission allows those particles emitted earlier to move ahead of the later - emitted particles along the outward direction .",
    "furthermore , a softer equation of state leads to higher entropy , and for fixed spectra , the entropy will be grow for increasing source volumes , @xmath12 . since the total entropy can be ascertained in a quasi - model - independent fashion from spectra and source dimensions , and since entropy is conserved during the expansion ,",
    "the product of the three dimensions is strongly linked to the equation of state @xcite .",
    "femtoscopic source sizes are also affected by non - equilibrium aspects of the dynamics .",
    "bulk viscosity , which is expected to be significant in the neighborhood of the critical temperature when the system struggles to maintain equilibrium , lowers the effective pressure and thus increases the entropy and leads to larger source dimensions .",
    "shear viscosity is mainly important at early times , when velocity gradients are large and highly anisotropic .",
    "this leads to an enhancement in the transverse components of the energy tensor , which accelerates the transverse expansion and gives smaller values of @xmath7 and @xmath5 relative to @xmath6 @xcite . at the earliest times ,",
    "before even viscous hydrodynamics is applicable , the pre - equilibrium state might be dominated by longitudinal color fields .",
    "these fields can , in principle , lead to exceptionally strong transverse components to the stress - energy tensor , which would amplify the effects of shear viscosity .",
    "the importance of early acceleration in explaining the experimental @xmath13 ratio has also been studied by incorporating initial transverse flow into ideal hydrodynamics @xcite and by adding a strong repulsive potential into microscopic cascade codes @xcite .",
    "free - streaming during the first fm/@xmath0 increases the transverse pressure relative to the longitudinal pressure , which increases radial flow more than elliptic flow @xcite .",
    "this had been thought to make it difficult to simultaneously fit both spectra and elliptic flow , though this was accomplished in @xcite .",
    "this issue might be resolved by better understanding the interface between the initial - state description and the following hydrodynamic description .",
    "the initial density profile also affects acceleration at early times @xcite . within the typical nuclear cross - section ( 40 mb )",
    ", a single nucleon will interact with multiple nucleons from the opposite beam . depending on the theoretical picture , e.g. , color - glass - condensate - inspired or wounded nucleon , the average radius of the initial fireball can vary by @xmath14 , with a more compact source being more explosive and leading to smaller values of @xmath13 .    to investigate these effects",
    "we apply a relativistic viscous hydrodynamic model , which couples to a cascade code for modeling the hadronic breakup stage and the decay of outgoing resonances .",
    "the outgoing phase space points for pions are used to generate source functions , and after convoluting with the squared wave function , generate two - pion correlations .",
    "these are then treated as data and fit to correlation functions from gaussian sources to extract @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "the hydrodynamic code uses israel - stewart equations which are modified to allow one to tune to the anisotropies of the initial stress - energy tensor .",
    "both the hydrodynamic and cascade descriptions are built on an assumption of azimuthal symmetry and boost - invariance .",
    "this prohibits a simultaneous analysis of elliptic flow , or a study of longitudinal acceleration , which is known to affect results at the 5 - 10% level .",
    "in addition to investigating all the sensitivities alluded to above , we compare data from star collaboration at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) . we do find solutions which come close to the the data without employing any particularly disquieting assumptions or any parameters outside what we would consider a reasonable range .",
    "although this paper focuses on femtoscopy , the mean @xmath15 of various calculations is also presented and compared to data .    after reviewing details of the model in the next section , the following section is devoted to the effects of varying the equation of state , viscosities , and initial conditions .",
    "the summary is devoted to drawing conclusions with an emphasis on understanding what future improvements in models and analysis are needed to reach rigorous quantitative statements about the microscopic properties of the qcd matter formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "for generating interferometric source functions , phase space points are first generated from a viscous hydrodynamic model , then fed into a cascade model which models the low - density hadronic stage of the collision .",
    "both models are written in terms of the variables @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the proper time , @xmath21 represents the longitudinal position , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 represent the radial position and azimuthal angle .",
    "both models were developed assuming radial symmetry and boost invariance which eliminates @xmath17 and @xmath19 from consideration . by reducing the dimensionality ,",
    "both speed and accuracy are vastly improved .",
    "the viscous hydrodynamic model is based on the formalism in @xcite , with more details provided below .",
    "the subsequent subsections provide details of the three model components .",
    "first , a review of the modified israel - stewart formalism described in @xcite is presented .",
    "a basic description of viscosity and the navier - stokes equation can be found in @xcite .",
    "recently , israel - stewart hydrodynamics @xcite has been extended and applied to nuclear physics @xcite . in ideal hydrodynamics ,",
    "the stress energy tensor becomes @xmath22 when viewed in the fluid rest frame ( here latin indices refer to spatial components only ) .",
    "viscous hydrodynamics deals with the deviation of @xmath23 from @xmath22 .",
    "for all the hydrodynamic calculations here , the fluid rest frame is defined such that @xmath24 , and diffusion of conserved particle numbers through fluid elements is ignored . in the fluid frame",
    "the deviations of @xmath23 can be expressed through five independent traceless components , @xmath25 , and the deviation of the trace , @xmath26 .",

    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 are not fixed as is the case for navier - stokes equations , but instead are dynamic objects .",
    "the ratios @xmath31 and @xmath32 should decay exponentially toward the navier - stokes values , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are related to the fluctuation of the stress energy tensor at fixed energy density , @xmath35 where no sum is implied in the last expression . to restrict the values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 to ranges @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively , the israel - stewart equations are modified by mapping @xmath25 and @xmath26 to @xmath38 and @xmath39 through hyperbolic tangents .",

    "an expression is needed for the evolution of the energy density .",
    "this is done by considering the change in the internal energy within a cell defined by adjacent mesh points and a fixed small rapidity range @xmath48 . in the fluid frame ,",
    "the volume of the cell is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the radius as viewed in the laboratory frame . in a time step",
    "@xmath51 the volume increases both due the increase in the longitudinal dimension @xmath52 and by the increase in the transverse dimensions . writing @xmath53",
    "the change in the internal energy of the cell is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the longitudinal direction and @xmath39 refers to the radial direction .",
    "given the internal energy and volume , one then knows the local energy density @xmath56 which closes the equations of motion . for the ideal case , @xmath57 , one recovers @xmath58 , which implies entropy conservation .",
    "indeed , when the code was run in this limit , entropy was conserved to better than 0.2 percent .    the equation of state used for the runs shown here consisted of three parts . for temperatures below 170 mev ,",
    "the equation of state was that of a hadronic gas . for a given cell",
    ", the pressure was calculated as a function of the energy density and the density of five conserved charges .",
    "the conserved charges were the number of strange plus anti - strange quarks , the number of baryons plus antibaryons , the effective number of pions ( e.g. , a @xmath59 meson counts as two pions ) , the number of @xmath17s and the number of @xmath60s . only the standard octet mesons and octet and decuplet baryons were considered , i.e. , the @xmath61 mesons and the @xmath62 baryons .",
    "the details of which particle numbers were fixed was not particularly important because the breakup density was chosen to be 400 mev/@xmath63 , which allowed the cells very little time to adjust their chemistry before the evolution was taken over by the cascade code .    for an intermediate range of energy densities , @xmath64 , the equation of state",
    "was chosen to have a constant speed of sound , i.e. , @xmath65 .",
    "here , @xmath66 is the energy density of an equilibrated hadron gas with a temperature of 170 mev . in the limit of @xmath67 , the equation of state",
    "becomes that of a first order phase transition with latent heat @xmath68 . for energy densities above @xmath69 , the speed of sound was bumped up to @xmath70 to be consistent with lattice gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the simple form for the equation of state was used so that by varying @xmath68 and @xmath71 one could study the sensitivity to the equation of state .",

    "a hadronic gas would be somewhat higher than 25 mb , but much of that cross section would be more forward peaked which reduces the effectiveness of collisions to thermalize the matter .",
    "it would not be surprising if more sophisticated calculations of the relaxation time would differ by a few tens of percent .",

    "bulk viscosities are expected to be negligible except near @xmath72 @xcite .",

    "bulk viscosities thus disappear high above @xmath72 where the temperatures far exceed the quark mass , and for temperatures well below the pion mass .",
    "in contrast , near @xmath72 the degrees of freedom and the condensed fields need to change in order to maintain equilibrium , which leads to a bulk viscosity in that region @xcite .",

    "the treatment of the effects of bulk viscosity here are undoubtedly naive . since the principal source of bulk viscosity might be the non - equilibrium chiral condensate , or @xmath93 field , relaxation times might be very large , the response might be very non - linear , and the behavior might be oscillatory , which contradicts the israel - stewart assumption that non - equilibrium deviations decay exponentially .",
    "thus , the investigations can probably only qualitatively describe the impact of non - equilibrium effects towards the trace of the stress - energy tensor .",

    "although it can only be applied if one neglects strong and coulomb forces , this method should be sufficient if one is generating correlations for the purpose of finding effective gaussian source sizes .",
    "both methods were tried for the calculation with the default parameters , with the comparison being illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rosl_fullwf ] . since the differences in the extracted gaussian source sizes were small and the trends of interest are unlikely to be affected , the latter method was chosen .",
    "although the calculations using the full wave functions are more realistic , it should be pointed out that experimental analyses have generated source radii by dividing the experimental correlation function by a @xmath145dependent factor with the purpose of dividing away the effect of the coulomb force in affecting correlation funcitons @xcite . since the coulomb correction factors are based on isotropic gaussian sources , the procedure is not exact .",
    "now that the discrepancy between models and experiments are less than 10% , the errors introduced in this procedure should be re - examined . in particular ,",
    "errors should be checked for radii at higher @xmath8 . for @xmath146 mev/@xmath0 , source functions",
    "are highly anisotropic in the frame of the pair due to lorentz contraction , with @xmath5 approaching five times @xmath6 , whereas the correction factors are built assuming that the source shape is isotropic in that frame .",
    "( color online ) gaussian source sizes were found by fitting generated correlation functions to those from gaussian sources .",
    "for the default parameter set , correlations were calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : koonin ] ) with ( triangles ) and without ( circles ) the effects of coulomb and strong interaction in the relative wave function .",
    "since calculations are much quicker without the interactions , and since differences are small , interactions are neglected for the calculations in the next section .",
    "the differences between the default calculation differs from experimental values ( stars ) @xcite are significantly lessened as compared to calculations based on ideal hydrodynamics @xcite.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to generate gaussian radii , correlations were calculated on a three - dimensional mesh in @xmath137 .",
    "these were then compared to predictions for @xmath147 for gaussian sources .",
    "the radii were chosen to minimize the sum of the squared radii . even though the correlations were remarkably non - gaussian for @xmath148 mev/@xmath0 , the radii were remarkably robust , and did not change appreciably if one neglected the low @xmath149 points in the fit . since the mesh and @xmath149 values were generated in the pair frame , the outward source size was then lorentz contracted so that it represented the shape of the outgoing phase space density in the laboratory frame .",
    "one of the prime motivations for interferometric measurements was the possibility of observing a long - lived mixed phase , which could only happen if the equation of state was first order with a large latent heat .",
    "some bag model parameterizations employed in the early days of the field had latent heats of several gev/@xmath63 .",
    "if that were the case , extracted lifetimes at the ags and sps might have been several tens of fm/@xmath0 depending on the amount of initial stopping @xcite .",
    "the longest lifetimes would occur for conditions where the interior energy density was initially at the peak value for the mixed phase .",
    "since a mixed phase has zero sound velocity , there would no impetus for explosion , and instead the outside would emit hadrons like a burning log .",
    "lattice calculations now preclude such equations of state , and indeed , no such long lived phases have been observed .",
    "instead , in lattice calculations the speed of sound appears to dip down to about @xmath150 , before re - stiffening to @xmath151 at high temperatures @xcite . by including resonances in a hadron gas ,",
    "the speed of sound is expected to be @xmath152 below @xmath72 . given that initial energy densities at rhic are well above those of the soft region , one should expect rhic collisions to be more explosive and shorter - lived that those at the ags and sps .",
    "qualitatively , these expectations have been met .",
    "however , quantitatively describing the source sizes with full hydrodynamic models has proved elusive .",
    "femtoscopy provides a six - dimensional test of any dynamical model , so it should not be surprising that reproducing experimental source sizes requires using a realistic equation of state , accurately modeling viscous effects and using correct initial conditions .",
    "we explore the impact of each of these three aspects of the modeling in the next three subsections .",
    "results from the default parameter set are compared to results where an isolated parameter set has been adjusted . for each calculation , the initial energy density is adjusted so that the final @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "radial flow , and in turn spectra , are also affected by all the variations studied here .",
    "table [ table : meanpt ] presents the mean @xmath15 for pions , kaons and protons .",
    "again , it should be emphasized that these calculations include all weak decays of hyperons and of the @xmath154 . to some extent ,",
    "these decay products are subtracted from experimental analyses , which might lead to the model predictions under predicting the mean @xmath15 for pions .",
    "however , the calculations also neglect symmetrization effects on the pion spectra , which should lower the pions mean @xmath15 .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainties in the experimental values in table [ table : meanpt ] are rather large , mainly due to the fact that experiments measure in a finite @xmath15 range .",
    "the experimental values for mean @xmath15 do agree with the default calculation , within the large experimental uncertainties . a more meaningful comparison , which would involve comparing actual spectra in the measured regions , is outside the scope of this study , but table [ table : meanpt ] is certainly sufficient for evaluating the sensitivity of the spectra to the various model parameters studied here .",
    "it should be emphasized that the sensitivity of spectra to the equation of state has been considered by numerous authors , and that in @xcite , sensitivity of the elliptic flow is also considered .",
    ".[table : meanpt ] the mean @xmath155 in mev/@xmath0 for central collisions for pions , kaons and protons .",
    "only charged species were used in the phenix analysis , and only negative hadrons were used for star . increasing the stiffness of the equation of state or the shear viscosity raises @xmath155 for heavier particles due to the corresponding increase in radial flow .",
    "the increase of radial flow with shear viscosity derives from the increase in @xmath156 and @xmath157 relative to @xmath98 at early times . by beginning the calculation with an isotropic stress energy tensor , radial flow",
    "is modestly reduced . increasing the bulk viscosity",
    "lowers the effective pressure , and thus modestly reduces radial flow . using collisional scaling to set the initial energy density profile results in a more compact initial source , which then generates more radial flow . [ cols=\">,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the principal conclusion from these investigations is that the femtoscopic data from rhic can be reproduced to within 10% with models combining viscous hydrodynamics and hadronic cascades . in particular",
    ", the @xmath13 ratio can be brought down close to unity .",
    "the failure of previous models appears to derive mainly from three shortcomings , all of which are related to under - predicting the explosivity of the collision .",
    "first , the equations of state were often too soft , using a first - order phase transition .",
    "a stiffer equation of state is more explosive , and can lower the @xmath13 ratio .",
    "secondly , previous treatments ignored acceleration before the thermalization time . from general arguments involving conservation of energy and momentum in the equations of motion of the stress - energy tensor , it should be clear that thermalization is not required for acceleration .",
    "in fact , longitudinal classical fields , which are far from equilibrium by definition , result in strong transverse acceleration . finally , the previous treatments were based on ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "the effects of shear , as already demonstrated in @xcite , increase the transverse pressure relative to the longitudinal pressure at early times , which of all the variations considered here , appears to be the most important .",
    "bulk effects , were manifest in the final mean @xmath15 , but made remarkably little difference in femtoscopic radii .",
    "previous treatments overpredicted the @xmath13 ratio by 40% or more @xcite , a result confirmed if we run this model with a softer equation of state , without viscosity , and delaying transverse acceleration for the first fm/@xmath0 .",
    "it would appear that improving models in all three areas mentioned above is required for rectifying the shortcomings .",
    "the default calculation , which includes all three such effects , provides a reasonable description to the data . without including longitudinal acceleration , which requires a three - dimensional model",
    ", it is unreasonable to expect better agreement and it is probably not meaningful to try to better fit the data by adjusting parameters .",
    "an additional area of uncertainty documented here comes from the choice of the initial profile , as a more compact source results in a more explosive source .",
    "one could reduce any of the three effects mentioned in the previous paragraph , then compensate for them by adjusting the initial density profile .    a second impression generated by this investigation",
    "is that it appears impossible to disentangle the various uncertainties mentioned above by focusing only on two - pion interferometry .",
    "spectra are sensitive to the same model features studied here , as evidenced by the mean @xmath15 values listed in table [ table : meanpt ] .",
    "elliptic flow observables , which require a higher - dimensionality model than used here , can also be used to assist in understanding the collision .",
    "hopefully , different observables will be relatively more sensitive to different facets of the model .",
    "then by performing a coordinated analysis of numerous classes of observables , one should be better able to answer specific question and determine specific parameters .",
    "these analyses should also incorporate a greater set of femtoscopic measurements , which we list here :    * femtoscopy using particles other than pions .",
    "heavier particles are more sensitive to collective flow due to their lower thermal velocity",
    ". correlations between a heavy particle and a light particle , e.g. @xmath158 , are especially sensitive to the patterns of collective flow .",
    "* non - central collisions and collisions at different energies .",
    "measurements have already been made as a function of the direction of the pair s momentum relative to the reaction plane @xcite .",
    "this information is rich in detail , but the meaning of the information is not yet understood .",
    "additionally , there exists data at different beam energies . by studying the response to changes in the initial energy density , without changing the size",
    ", one should gain some leverage for disentangling some of the issues mentioned above .",
    "finally , it should be emphasized that , although the large discrepancy with the @xmath13 ratio has been eliminated , none of the variations studied here provided a completely satisfactory reproduction of the @xmath15 dependence of source dimensions .",
    "the data showed a modest fall of the ratio for higher @xmath15 , which combined with the constraint that the ratio must be unity for @xmath159 , gives a non - monotonic behavior .",
    "although the rise and fall are only of the order of 10% , the model calculations all showed monotonic behavior with @xmath15 . furthermore , the model calculations tend to over - predict @xmath7 at low @xmath15 . this might be due to the assumption of boost invariance , which if relaxed , should provide corrections in the direction of the data .",
    "finally , conspicuous by its absence , has been a comparison of the @xmath160 factors , which represent the fraction of pairs that are correlated .",
    "the model calculations over - predicted these factors , but without a better understanding of experimental details about acceptance of weak decay products and particle mis - identification fractions , one can not as yet draw any conclusions .",
