    "variability of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) provides the clearest evidence for dynamic processes occurring in the central engines and in the jets of these objects .",
    "its study is therefore a powerful way to investigate the innermost regions of agn and the emission mechanisms responsible for the huge observed luminosities .",
    "the emission from blazars spans the range from radio to @xmath3-ray energies , and exhibits more rapid and higher amplitude variability than other agn ( bregman 1990 ; wagner & witzel 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , simultaneous multiwavelength monitoring of blazars is particularly suited to estimating the sizes of the emitting regions ( as a function of wavelength ) and to understanding , through correlated variability at different frequencies , the radiation processes .",
    "the most widely accepted picture for blazar emission at radio through uv wavelengths is the synchrotron process within an inhomogeneous jet .",
    "the model is typically characterized by a spatial dependence of the magnetic field , electron density and maximum electron energy , and usually incorporates a relativistic velocity of the plasma within the jet , which causes beaming of the radiation . how the power is transported along the jet and transferred to the high energy electrons responsible for the observed emission is still unknown .",
    "particle acceleration may take place at a single ( dominant ) shock front or in a quasi - continuous way ( small shocks ) along the jet . in the former case ,",
    "the spectral energy distribution from the millimeter to the soft x - rays derives from the energy distribution of the relativistic electrons accelerated at the shock front , with lower energy particles extending farther from the shock due to their longer lifetimes . in the case of _ in situ _ acceleration ( marscher 1980 ; knigl 1981 ; ghisellini , maraschi , & treves 1985 ; hutter & mufson 1986 ) the maximum emitted synchrotron frequency usually decreases along the jet , with uv and soft x - rays being produced closest to the central active source .    in pks  2155304 , the brightest known bl lac object at uv wavelengths , synchrotron emission produces the optical and uv continuum , as demonstrated by simultaneous spectropolarimetric observations in the two bands ( allen et al .",
    "the synchrotron emission extends to the medium x - ray range ( kii et al .",
    "1996 ) and has a maximum power per decade ( @xmath4 ) between the uv and soft x - ray range ( wandel & urry 1991 ) . the spectral steepening from optical to uv to x - rays can be attributed to radiative energy losses in the single shock model , or to the decreasing volume of the region emitting at higher frequencies in the inhomogeneous jet model . in either case",
    "the highest amplitude synchrotron variability is expected to be observed at or above the peak power output , which is determined by the steady - state balance of electron acceleration and radiation , since small changes in the electron acceleration substantially alter the higher energy emission .",
    "previous monitoring of pks  2155304 with iue probed its variability in the far - uv domain ( 1200 - 3000  ) on a range of time scales from years down to a few hours , though the sampling was usually sparse , uneven , or limited in time ( maraschi et al . 1986 ; urry et al . 1988 ; treves et al . 1989 ; edelson et al . 1991 ; urry et al .",
    "1993 , henceforth u93 ) .",
    "the iue campaign in november 1991 ( u93 ) , which was coordinated with rosat observations , had adequate time coverage ( 30 days ) and sampling to probe interday variability on an extended time interval , and even intraday variability during the continuous observing period ( @xmath05 days out of 30 ) .",
    "the presence of recurrent flares on a @xmath00.7-day time scale prompted further iue intensive monitoring in may 1994 , coordinated with euve ( marshall et al .",
    "1996 ) , asca ( kii et al . 1996 ) , and rosat ( urry et al . 1996 ) , as well as radio , near - ir , and optical coverage from ground - based telescopes ( pesce et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the aim of the iue campaign was to obtain the longest and best sampled uv light curve ever , in order to test the shortest possible variation time scales , within the capabilities of the iue instruments , and to explore the correlation with emission at other wavelengths ( urry et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the iue monitoring . in ",
    "2 we present the iue observations and data analysis , in   3 we describe the uv light curves and spectral variability , in   4 we discuss these results and in   5",
    "we summarize our conclusions .",
    "iue was scheduled for continuous observations ( three 8-hr shifts per day ) from 1994 may 15 to 25 inclusive , with 8 brief ( @xmath12 hr ) and 5 longer ( between 4 and 17 hr ) gaps due to earth occultation and to a few time - critical programs .",
    "the target acquisition was done through a double blind offset : first we pointed to the nearby bright star sao 213406 ( v = 6.5 , at 44@xmath5 distance from the source ) , then to the fainter sao 213450 ( v = 9.2 , at 4.5@xmath5 ) , and finally to the target itself .",
    "the swp and lwp cameras were exposed in low dispersion mode alternately for 55 and 25 minutes respectively , to achieve comparable signal - to - noise ratio in both cameras , for a typical uv spectral slope of pks  2155304 ( @xmath6 ) . in the absence of operational problems , we obtained one pair of spectra each 96 minutes , due to satellite maneuvering and camera preparation overheads .",
    "this time interval was chosen to phase with the asca satellite orbital period to allow cleaner cross - correlation analysis between the uv and x - ray light curves ; depending on the overheads , some of the spectra had slightly longer or shorter integration times than the nominal 25 and 55 minutes .",
    "one long - wavelength spectrum ( lwp 28222 ) and three short - wavelength spectra ( swp 50815 , 50840 , 50854 ) were very underexposed ( the exposure times were less than half the normal values ) and were discarded from the subsequent analysis .",
    "the photometrically flat - fielded and geometrically corrected images were inspected to assure proper target centering .",
    "one long - wavelength spectrum was unusable because of off - axis placement of the aperture during exposure ( lwp 28187 ) .",
    "as of late 1992 , scattered solar light severely affects the iue field of view ( depending on the satellite position with respect to the sun ) and can significantly compromise the spectrophotometry longwards of @xmath02700   ( caplinger 1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "the scattered light also precludes useful information about the source brightness at optical wavelengths from the fes , so no fes counts from the source were recorded .",
    "spectra were extracted from each of the 236 good iue images using the tomsips routine ( ayres 1993 ; ayres et al . 1995 ) , a modified version of the signal - weighted extraction technique ( swet ; kinney , bohlin , & neill 1991a ) .",
    "the extracted net fluxes were converted to absolute fluxes using calibration curves based on swp and lwp low dispersion spectra of the white dwarf wd g191-b2b .",
    "no correction was applied for the sensitivity degradation of the cameras .",
    "the complete log of the iue observations is reported in table 1 .",
    "two typical spectra from the campaign are shown in fig . 1 along with the intrinsic error distribution of the spectral flux .",
    "the best - fit power - law model for the continuum is shown as a solid line .",
    "the results of the tomsips extraction were compared with alternative processings using the standard iuesips , gex ( urry & reichert 1988 ) , and the final archive newsips ( nichols & linsky 1996 ) . in the first two cases a general consistency was found within @xmath010 - 15% , though gex gave anomalous results in a few cases .",
    "the newsips lwp spectra from the end of the us2 shift , which is the most heavily affected by background radiation , turned out to be unreliable .",
    "for these cases , the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectral data is so low ( because of the high background level ) that the extraction technique uses only two spline nodes to fit the cross - dispersion profile ( imhoff 1996 ) . in presence of solar light contamination , which ramps up dramatically above 2800 ,",
    "if only two spline nodes are used to fit the cross dispersion profile , the fit can not accurately follow the rapid decline in flux below 2800 , resulting in overestimated flux in a large portion of the spectrum . for the swp ,",
    "the newsips and tomsips light curves at 1400   are in agreement , apart from the different applied calibrations .",
    "the expected interstellar extinction of the uv flux due to galactic neutral hydrogen is @xmath7 = 0.08 mag , corresponding to a column density n@xmath8 @xmath9 ( lockman & savage 1995 ) , assuming a gas - to - dust ratio n@xmath10 = 5.2@xmath11 @xmath9 mag@xmath12 ( shull & van steenberg 1985 ) and a total - to - selective extinction ratio @xmath13 ( rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) . the 236 iue spectra are well fitted by simple power - law models plus this assumed reddening (   2.2 ) .",
    "however , with @xmath7 as a free parameter , the @xmath14 associated with a power - law model is minimized ( both over the full set of swp and over the set of merged swp+lwp spectral flux distributions ) for @xmath7 = 0.4 mag , with a high degree of significance ( @xmath15 99.99% , according to the f - test ) . this value is inconsistent with that deduced from the galactic column density , and in fact with the results from u93 , who found no such excess reddening .",
    "this might indicate variable absorption at the source or in intervening material ( bruhweiler et al .",
    "nevertheless , since pks  2155304 was observed by euve during the campaign ( which would have been unlikely if the extinction were so high ) and since the @xmath7 = 0.08 mag fits are still acceptable , we conservatively adopted @xmath7 = 0.1 mag for consistency with u93 .",
    "( this was derived , under the same above assumptions , from the hydrogen column density determined by the @xmath16 21 cm survey of stark et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , n@xmath17 @xmath9 . )",
    "note that for @xmath7 = 0.1 mag , the swp+lwp spectral indices are consistent with a simple power - law , while @xmath7 = 0.4 mag would require that the swp slope is steeper by @xmath18 than the lwp ( fig .",
    "2 ) . for the dereddening corrections we used the extinction curve of seaton ( 1979 ) , as in u93 .",
    "the updated dereddening curve of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) would imply an average discrepancy of the fitted parameters not exceeding their uncertainties .      for the spectral analysis we followed a procedure similar to u93 .",
    "through an iterative , chi - squared minimization fitting routine , the dereddened swp spectral flux distributions ( 1230 - 1950 ) were fitted in wavelength space to a simple power - law model of the form @xmath19 , ignoring the regions 1277 - 1281 , 1286 - 1290 , 1660 - 1666 , and 1780 - 1800 , which are affected by camera artifacts ( crenshaw , bruegman , & norman 1990 ) , as well as regions of individual spectra contaminated by cosmic ray hits .",
    "the fit was normalized to 1560 , which is the flux - weighted mean wavelength of the chosen interval for a spectral index @xmath20 .",
    "similarly , power - law spectral fits were made to the lwp spectra in the 2100 - 2700  region , which is not heavily affected by the solar scattered light . because the signal in the 2700 - 2800  region did not exceed the fit curve extrapolation , and was well represented by the same power - law",
    ", we concluded that the effect of the iue baffle anomaly is negligible shortward of 2800  ( as suggested also by direct image inspection ) , so we extended the fitted region to 2800 .",
    "the fiducial wavelength of the fit normalization , computed as above , was chosen to be 2580 .",
    "the 1-@xmath21 uncertainties associated with the fitted fluxes are generally less than 1% for swp spectra , and a few percent for lwp due to the large intrinsic errors affecting the spectral signal between 2100   and 2400 .",
    "to these uncertainties a @xmath01% photometric error was added in quadrature , following u93 and edelson et al .",
    "the best - fit parameters , energy spectral indices @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 ) and fitted fluxes at 1400   and 2800  ( swp and lwp respectively ) , are given in table 1 , as are the reduced @xmath14 values for each fit ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we also fitted a power - law model to pairs of swp and lwp spectra taken close together in time .",
    "the fit was done over the wavelength range 1230 - 2800 , excluding the same regions that were discarded in the swp spectra and the 1900 - 2150   interval , which is affected by large errors . during the first day of monitoring",
    ", the extremely fast variability does not allow any meaningful match between swp and lwp exposures .",
    "therefore , since the determination of the spectral index would yield unreliable values , due to lack of simultaneity , we excluded the first six pairs of spectra from computation of the combined energy index @xmath25 .",
    "the combined swp+lwp fit results are presented in table 2 .",
    "the present analysis leads to a steeper average spectral slope than reported for the 1991 data ( @xmath26 is larger by @xmath028% , @xmath27 by @xmath014% , and @xmath28 by @xmath044% ) , which were reduced with the swet method .",
    "we investigated the cause of this difference by re - analyzing the 1991 data after extracting the spectra with the tomsips routine and found that the change is mostly due to the different adopted calibration curves , and to the fact that the 1991 data were corrected for the swp camera sensitivity degradation , with smaller effects due to the more limited fitting range at the long wavelengths and ( only marginally ) to the different extraction algorithms ( e.g. , profile normalizations ) .",
    "fitting the 1991 tomsips extracted spectra to a power - law yields average spectral indices that are consistent with those obtained for the 1994 data .",
    "( see table 3 for a synoptic comparison between the 1991 and 1994 sets . )",
    "the average @xmath24 values for the swp , lwp , and merged spectral fits are 1.02 , 0.67 , and 1.00 , respectively .",
    "this indicates that , given the derived flux errors , the power - law model is acceptable , therefore no rescaling was applied to the intrinsic flux errors ( as had been done in u93 ) . to determine errors on spectral index we looked at the differences between spectral indices for pairs of adjacent spectra taken closer in time than 0.1 days , excluding the first six points in each energy index curve ( where the variability was much faster than the exposure time ) , leaving 94 , 95 , and 91 pairs of swp , lwp , and merged spectra , respectively .    assuming that the spectral index does not vary significantly between two observations spaced only @xmath02 hours apart in time ( which is not the case in the first part of the monitoring ) , the difference divided by the sum in quadrature of their individual errors should be normally distributed , with a unity variance . since we found variances larger than unity ( 2.13 , 1.17 , and 2.86 respectively for the swp , lwp , and merged spectra ) , we applied , as in u93 , a correction to the spectral index errors equivalent to such variance .",
    "the spectral index distributions for the swp and lwp overlap ( though the former is much narrower ) , indicating that the assumed extinction produces a consistent result for both swp and lwp spectral shapes ( see fig .",
    "for @xmath7 = 0.4 mag , the fitted fluxes at 1400   and 2800   would be larger by @xmath0110% and @xmath065% , respectively , and the mean swp and lwp spectral indices would be smaller , the differences being @xmath00.3 and @xmath01.2 , respectively , compared to the values given in table 1 for @xmath7 = 0.1 mag .",
    "the swp and lwp spectral index distributions for @xmath7 = 0.4 mag ( fig .",
    "2b ) differ by @xmath18 , suggesting that such a high extinction value is unlikely .",
    "both long- and short - wavelength iue light curves clearly show strong fast variability ( fig .",
    "the most striking result of the campaign is the high amplitude , extremely rapid flux variability detected during the first day of monitoring ( fig .",
    "3b ) . at 2800 ,",
    "flux variations as large as a factor 2.2 were found in 1.5 hours ( i.e. , between one lwp integration and the other ) , implying that significant variability can occur on time scales shorter than the typical iue integration time .",
    "the flux at 1400  also varied remarkably in the first part of the monitoring , though with smaller observed amplitude ( @xmath025% in 1.5 hours ) .",
    "this behavior is entirely new and unexpected , since the many previous iue observations showed only minor differences in swp and lwp variability , usually in the sense of a larger amplitude in swp . in fig . 3b the two light curves",
    "are compared normalizing the 2800  and the 1400  fluxes to their respective mean values ( computed excluding the initial flares , i.e. the first six flux points of each curve ) .",
    "the figure shows that the swp light curve can be reconciled with the hypothesis of a complete correlation with the lwp ( i.e. , no spectral variability ) given that the swp integrations are twice as long as for the lwp and allowing for the fact that the shortest time scale variability is probably not resolved in either band .    because the observed variability at 2800  is of unprecedented amplitude for such short time scales , we investigated possible extrinsic causes .",
    "first , we asked whether motion of the spacecraft could have caused a dip in flux as the source drifted out and back into the large aperture .",
    "we examined carefully the line - by - line file for the image with the sharpest drop in spectral flux , lwp  28142 .",
    "the spectrum is visible with a good signal - to - noise ratio in the central part of the line - by - line image .",
    "this , together with proper centering of the adjacent swp spectra with respect to the geocoronal ly@xmath29 line ( which fills the aperture ) , exclude a drift of the target along the long dimension of the aperture .",
    "similarly , a drift along the dispersion direction is excluded because of the location of the reseau marks at the same wavelengths as in the other images , and the accuracy of the spacecraft slews between the target and the offset star .",
    "second , we ruled out a mis - registration of the optimal extraction slit with respect to the spectrum , since several independent extraction methods ( including the original boxcar ) give essentially the same spectrum .",
    "third , this `` dip '' event might resemble some sudden flux drops detected in lwp data during iue intensive monitorings , which have been ascribed to voltage failures in the lwp camera ( lwp anomaly , t. teays , private communication , 1996 ) .",
    "however , such spurious effects are very rare , and no firm conclusion has been achieved on the correlation between the occurrence of the phenomenon and electric current depletion during the exposure .",
    "more importantly , these events are confined to the lwp , while the event in pks  2155304 has a ( less dramatic ) counterpart in the swp light curve , in the euve light curve ( marshall et al .",
    "1996 ) , and in polarized optical light ( pesce et al . 1996 ) .",
    "considering all these points , we conclude the rapid initial variations reflect actual events in the bl lac object .    in both light curves , after the very active period recorded at the beginning of the campaign",
    ", the flux stays relatively constant ( after may 16 ) , with a gentle increase and decline of @xmath010% over 3.5 days , and then there is a prominent 2-day flare , with a total increase of @xmath035% , starting on may 19 .",
    "further variation in the last four days of the monitoring is @xmath120% in both bands . throughout the monitoring , small ( 5 - 10% ) and rapid ( @xmath0 hours )",
    "flux variations are superimposed on the more dramatic flares .",
    "a variability test ( edelson 1992 ) yields similar variability indices for the swp and lwp light curves , which are marginally consistent within the 10% error , calculated as in edelson et al .",
    "( 1995 ; @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the standard deviation of the flux , and @xmath32 its average value ) : @xmath33 = 0.11 , @xmath34 = 0.13 . performing the test on the light curves after removing their first , dramatically variable portions , results in a 0.10 variability index both for swp and lwp .",
    "this is consistent with the results of the intensive november 1991 campaign on pks  2155304 , when comparable amplitude variability was found in both iue wavelength ranges .",
    "systematically larger amplitude variability is found at shorter uv wavelengths than at longer ones for blazars observed over longer time scales ( kinney et al .",
    "1991b ; edelson 1992 ) , but the difference is not significant given the errors ( treves & girardi 1991 ) , and such differences are not observed on short time scales , where rapid variations are resolved ( see u93 ) .",
    "we computed auto- and cross - correlation functions for the light curves by means of the discrete correlation function method ( dcf ; edelson & krolik 1988 ) . since the character of the variability in the first day is extreme and unresolved , we systematically removed the first 6 flux points in both light curves prior to application of the dcf routine .    the auto - correlation function of the present swp and lwp light curves ( fig .",
    "4 ) does not show any evidence of periodicity ( as would be implied by characteristic `` humps '' on the auto - correlation function curve at non - zero lags ) nor is any visible in the light curves , in contrast to the previous findings .",
    "the auto - correlation function of a data train shows features at the timescale corresponding to recurrence in its variations , such as periodicity or quasi - periodicity would imply .",
    "this allowed u93 to find a quasi - periodic variation in the november 1991 iue light curves of pks  2155304 with a @xmath00.7 days time scale ( a strict periodicity was shown not to be statistically significant by edelson et al .",
    "the swp and lwp light curves are well correlated with each other , with no apparent lag larger than @xmath00.1 days ( fig .",
    "5 ) , which is the approximate temporal resolution .      during the first day of monitoring the uv spectrum of pks  2155304 varied both in the lwp and , less prominently , in the swp range ( fig .",
    "after may 16 , the slopes of the swp and lwp spectra have an overall fractional variability @xmath35 of 0.08 and 0.28 , respectively ( with a 10% uncertainty on these values ) , according to the variability test of edelson ( 1992 ) .",
    "testing the spectral index behavior against a constant trend yields a @xmath24 of 1.8 for swp and 2.2 for lwp , which implies a probability of constancy of less than 0.1% .",
    "the central resolved flare is accompanied by spectral variations of more modest amplitude : @xmath36 is found for both index curves , whereas @xmath24 = 53 and @xmath24 = 21 is associated with the flux variations in the swp and lwp , respectively .",
    "the auto - correlation function of the lwp spectral index shows equally spaced peaks with @xmath01 day separation .",
    "this periodicity ( also recognizable in fig .",
    "6b ) is spurious , deriving from the periodic background contamination during the us2 shift .",
    "the swp spectral index auto - correlation function does not exhibit any significant features .",
    "no clear trend is visible between the fluxes at 1400  and the swp spectral slopes , but their cross - correlation has a minimum at a lag of @xmath37 day ( fig .",
    "7 ) , which implies that spectral flattening ( steepening ) leads flux increases ( decreases ) . limiting the cross - correlation function computation to the segments of the light and index curves corresponding to the central flare yields no evidence that the effect might be dominated by the behavior during the outburst .",
    "the slope @xmath25 of the swp+lwp spectra is significantly variable ( @xmath38 = 0.08 , with @xmath24 = 2.8 ; see fig .",
    "6c , where @xmath25 is plotted only for observations taken after may 16 ) . during the central flare , a @xmath39",
    "is associated with the @xmath25 variation .",
    "cross - correlating @xmath25 with the flux at 2000  yields the same results as found for the swp : spectral hardening @xmath01 day in advance of flux rise .",
    "iue monitoring of pks  2155304 in may 1994 has given us the best sampled uv light curve ever obtained for an agn , with 2.2 times the temporal extension of the intensive part of the november 1991 campaign .",
    "on average , the state presently detected was @xmath020% lower than in 1991 in both the swp and the lwp .",
    "the observed flux variability behavior was also remarkably different .",
    "the light curves from the two intensive campaigns are shown for comparison in fig .",
    "in particular , we do not see the quasi - periodicity seen in 1991 ( see flux auto - correlation functions , fig .",
    "4 ) , which has therefore to be regarded as random or transitory .",
    "no significant spectral change is seen between the two epochs ( see   2.2 and table 3 ) . compared to the iue archival data ( edelson et al .",
    "1992 ; pian & treves 1993 ) both uv flux and spectral index were about average in may 1994 .",
    "the 1994 data exhibit dramatic and unprecedented variability , which is still underresolved , during the first day of the monitoring and later a well sampled flare of a factor of @xmath035% in @xmath01.5 days , visible in both the 1400   and 2800  light curves without any significant difference .",
    "the flux rise to maximum is longer than the fading ( @xmath01 day ) toward the previous `` quiescent '' state ( as indicated by the asymmetric shape of the flare , fig .",
    "3a ) , in agreement with the finding that uv flux decrease in blazars is usually sharper than brightening ( edelson 1992 ) .",
    "the longer and `` structured '' rise requires that the mechanism producing the flare is not `` instantaneous '' but rather intrinsically long or diluted , possibly by light travel time effects in the emission region , or by multiple smaller events .",
    "the fast fluctuations seen at the beginning of the light curve are truly exceptional . during the first day the lwp light curve exhibits a variation of a factor 2.2 in 8 hours and a second flare of similar amplitude in 1.5 hours ( fig .",
    "rapid variability is simultaneously seen in the swp and in the lwp . fast ( though unresolved ) variations have also been detected during the optical observations simultaneous to the present iue campaign ( pesce et al .",
    "1996 ) . defining the flux doubling time scale as @xmath40 one obtains @xmath41 = 6.87",
    "hr and @xmath42 = 1.36 hr as minimum values at 1400   and 2800    respectively during the monitoring .",
    "this is the most rapid observed flux doubling for pks  2155304 either in the uv or optical range , where typical values are of the order of days ( see u93 ; carini & miller 1992 ; miller 1996 ) .",
    "doubling time scales as short as @xmath01 hour have been seen in pks  2155304 optical light curves ( pesce et al .",
    "1996 ; paltani et al .",
    "1996 ) , but for typical amplitudes much smaller than a factor of 2 . in x - rays ,",
    "1-hour doubling time scales for this source are relatively more common ( morini et al . 1986 ) .",
    "similar events were observed in several x - ray bright blazars in the x - ray band ( see e.g. , h  0323 + 022 , feigelson et al .",
    "1986 ; pks  2155304 , treves et al .",

    "conspicuous spectral variations corresponding to the big central flare are not seen , a behavior reminiscent of other bl lacs in optical and uv ( oj  287 , pian et al .",

    "; pks  0716 + 714 , wagner & witzel 1994 , see however ghisellini et al .",
    "1996 , who find opposite results for this object in the optical ) .",
    "this result is to be compared with the outcome of longer term monitorings of blazars ( days to years ) , showing that uv spectral variations do occur but are generally modest compared to flux changes and often weakly or not clearly correlated with them ( edelson 1992 ; shrader et al .",
    "1994 ; koratkar et al .",
    "1996 ) . where correlation is found , it is generally in the sense of a harder spectrum for brighter flux ( urry et al .",

    "7 ) is a minimum at @xmath0 1 day , which represents anti - correlation of the two quantities , consistent with the longer term spectral variability mentioned above .",
    "the negative time - lag means that the spectrum is hardening ( softening ) @xmath01 day before the flux increases ( decreases ) , a result which , as yet unexplained , was also found in the november 1991 campaign ( see discussion in u93 ) .",
    "the variability in the initial part of the light curve is so rapid that we can not test color variations using the joint lwp and swp ranges during the event .",
    "however the spectral index in the lwp range takes one of its lowest values ( @xmath43 = 0.5 ) and its maximum value ( @xmath43 = 1.7 ) in correspondence to the relative maximum flux observed on may 15.95 and to the deep minimum observed on may 16.08 , respectively .",
    "thus the little information we have points to some spectral variability rather than to an achromatic event .    the completely resolved central flare , together with the @xmath050% and @xmath080% correlated flares detected at the extreme uv and x - ray wavelengths , respectively ( marshall et al .",
    "1996 ; kii et al .",
    "1996 ; urry et al .",
    "1996 ) , is consistent with a variability amplitude monotonically increasing with energy , as expected for a synchrotron flare in an inhomogeneous jet ( celotti , maraschi , & treves 1991 ; georganopoulos & marscher 1996 ) .",
    "the excellent correlation of the swp and lwp light curves implies that the uv emission in the 1200 - 3000   range is produced within a unique emitting region , without difference in the electron cooling times at these wavelengths larger than an hour .",
    "since these must be equal to or shorter than the uv fading time scales , we can estimate a lower limit for the magnetic field in the uv emitting portion of the jet ( blandford 1990 ) , locally approximated as a homogeneous region :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the frequency in units of @xmath46 hz , @xmath47 is the observed variability timescale in hours , and @xmath48 represents the doppler factor of the relativistic bulk motion .",
    "based on the shortest observed variability time scale ( 1.5 hr at 2800  ) and assuming @xmath49 , we derive @xmath50 g.    the detection of gev @xmath3-rays from pks  2155304 ( vestrand , stacy , & sreekumar 1996 ) indicates that inverse compton radiation due to electrons scattering off the synchrotron photons or other soft seed photons is significant .",
    "the seed photons are expected to emit at optical and uv wavelengths ( @xmath51 , where the maximum electron energy @xmath3 is typically @xmath52 ) . given the derived lower limit on the magnetic field and the measured synchrotron luminosity in the uv ( @xmath53 ) , we can estimate the expected @xmath3-ray luminosity ( @xmath54 ) in the homogeneous case of an emitting blob of radius @xmath55 .",
    "we consider the following relation between the observed synchrotron and inverse compton luminosities :    @xmath56    hence    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the magnetic energy density , and @xmath59 is the synchrotron radiation energy density . for @xmath60 erg s@xmath12 , corresponding to the uv emission alone , and @xmath50 g , @xmath61 hr , @xmath49 , one obtains @xmath62 erg s@xmath12 , consistent with the observed @xmath3-ray luminosity of @xmath63 erg s@xmath12 .",
    "the only quantities not directly observed are @xmath64 and @xmath48 .",
    "the approximation @xmath49 is supported by other observations ; given the @xmath3-ray limit here , @xmath64 could be an order of magnitude larger than 1 g.    the extremely rapid variation observed at the beginning of the uv monitoring implies that the limit @xmath65 erg s@xmath66 ( fabian 1979 ) is slightly exceeded ( by a factor of @xmath01.2 ) if an accretion efficiency @xmath67 is assumed , for a redshift @xmath68 = 0.116 ( falomo et al .",
    "1993 ) , a hubble constant @xmath69 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 and a deceleration parameter @xmath70 = 0.5 , and hence the rapid variations support the idea of relativistic beaming . based only on the flux change detected in the 2100 - 2800   band , the beaming factor need not exceed unity , but it might be well larger considering the simultaneous ( and in some cases larger ) flux variation in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum , which is unfortunately undersampled ( see urry et al .",
    "the observed time scale corresponds to a very small emission region , only @xmath71 cm if beaming corrections are not applied , or @xmath72 cm for @xmath73 .",
    "notice that the constraint on the presence of beaming derived only from the variability in the uv band is a factor of 4 more stringent than found in u93 , but weaker than that determined by morini et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , who detected a rapid increase in x - ray ( 1 - 6 kev ) flux for which @xmath74 exceeded the above limit by a factor 10 .",
    "the may 1994 iue monitoring on pks  2155304 , which was part of a simultaneous multiwavelength campaign from radio to x - rays , yielded the best sampled uv light curve for this or any blazar and revealed significant flux variability at different time scales , from hours to days .",
    "spectral changes are generally modest and not clearly correlated with flux variations . a resolved central flare of @xmath035% amplitude was observed in both iue cameras , and was likely correlated with flares of different amplitude and duration at higher energies ( urry et al .",
    "the 1.5-hour flux variation of a factor 2.2 seen at 2800   during the first day of monitoring is unprecedented for blazars as a class .",
    "this event , which suggests the occurrence of variability on time scales even shorter than the iue time resolution , represents a definite violation of the limits on luminosity variability , therefore implying the presence of relativistic beaming .",
    "both variability events are interpreted within a scenario in which synchrotron radiation is the primary emission mechanism , and a lower limit of 1 g on the intensity of the magnetic field is determined , which turns out to be consistent with a calculation of this physical quantity based on the multiwavelength data and with the @xmath3-ray flux observed by egret .",
    "comparison with the results from the 1991 iue intensive monitoring of pks  2155304 shows that the variability characteristics detected at the two epochs are fundamentally different .",
    "in particular , unlike the findings of the 1991 campaign , no periodicity is seen in the present data .",
    "the @xmath01 day anti - correlation between flux and spectral variations is however maintained .",
    "the fastest variability in the uv has been largely undersampled with iue for pks  2155304 , and in general for other blazars .",
    "uv telescopes allowing a better time resolution and continuous coverage are clearly needed .",
    "apart from hst , which has rarely been dedicated to long monitorings , none are presently available .",
    "while the fast sporadic variability may be most apparent in the uv , it should be expected to manifest itself , possibly in a less extreme form , also at optical wavelengths .",
    "some indication is already present in the optical data of the 1994 campaign , especially in the polarization measurements ( pesce et al .",
    "these arguments point to the importance of intensive , systematic monitoring in the optical band , possibly with polarization information .",
    "such programs , which have led to the discovery of intraday variability in a number of blazars ( wagner & witzel 1995 ; miller 1996 ; sillanp et al . 1996 ; smith 1996 ) , can be carried out with medium sized telescopes and standard instrumentation , but need long , uninterrupted observing runs , possibly coordinated among different sites .",

    "<S> the same variability was seen in both short- and long - wavelength iue light curves , with zero formal lag ( @xmath1 2 hr ) , except during the rapid initial flare , when the variations were not resolved . </S>",
    "<S> spectral index variations were small and not clearly correlated with flux . </S>",
    "<S> the flux variability observed in the present monitoring is so rapid that for the first time , based on the uv emission alone , the traditional @xmath2 limit indicating relativistic beaming is exceeded . the most rapid variations , under the likely assumption of synchrotron radiation , lead to a lower limit of 1 g on the magnetic field strength in the uv emitting region . </S>",
