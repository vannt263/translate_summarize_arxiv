    "the observations of neutron stars in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) led to the discovery of the khz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) and the burst oscillations @xcite .",
    "it has almost been firmly established from the observations that the frequency of the burst oscillation is very close to the spin frequency of the neutron star , i.e. , @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the khz qpos from neutron star lmxbs have some important observational properties .",
    "these high - frequency qpos usually appear in pairs in the @xmath1 hz range .",
    "both the upper khz qpo frequency @xmath2 and the lower khz qpo frequency @xmath3 correlate with the x - ray luminosity of the source @xcite . according to early observations",
    ", the peak separation between the khz qpo frequencies seemed to be directly related to the spin frequency of the neutron star , i.e. , @xmath4 .",
    "the systematic analysis of all qpo data , however , showed that the peak separation @xmath5 is not constant for a given source .",
    "indeed , @xmath6 decreases as both the khz qpo frequencies @xmath2 and @xmath7 increase @xcite . according to the analysis of the early khz qpo data , @xmath8 for @xmath9 hz and @xmath10 for @xmath11 hz among neutron star sources with different burst or spin frequencies @xcite .",
    "the recent analysis of all available data , however , revealed that @xmath5 significantly deviates from either @xmath12 or @xmath13 for almost half of all sources and that @xmath14 decreases from a value @xmath15 to a value @xmath16 as @xmath17 increases @xcite .",
    "the frequency correlations of khz qpos can be explained , albeit qualitatively at this stage , within the boundary region model @xcite .",
    "next , we discuss the interpretation of the observational properties of khz qpos within the boundary region model .",
    "according to the boundary region model ( brm ) , the likely origin of the high - frequency qpos is the innermost region of the accretion disk around the compact object . in neutron star sources ,",
    "the khz qpos are produced in the boundary region ( br ) or the boundary layer where the angular velocity of the accretion flow is non - keplerian @xcite . in black hole candidates , it is the relativistic disk region near the innermost stable circular orbit which is responsible for the production of the high - frequency qpo pairs with a frequency ratio around 1.5 @xcite .",
    "the interaction of the inner disk with the magnetosphere of the neutron star rotating with an angular frequency @xmath18 leads to the formation of a magnetohydrodynamic br throughout which the angular frequency @xmath19 of the accreting matter deviates from the keplerian frequency @xmath20 to match the stellar spin frequency @xmath21 at the innermost disk radius @xmath22 @xcite .    in the conventional regime of accretion where the neutron star is a _",

    "the radial epicyclic frequency @xmath26 is the same as the angular frequency @xmath19 if @xmath27 .",
    "it is a well known fact that the nondegeneracy between @xmath26 and @xmath19 appears in the regime of strong gravity due to general relativistic effects . even in the non - relativistic regime",
    ", the degeneracy between @xmath26 and @xmath19 is removed in a hydrodynamic br throughout which @xmath28 if the br is sub - keplerian @xcite .",
    "the analysis of global hydrodynamic modes of free oscillations in a typical sub - keplerian br revealed that the fastest growing modes are excited near the disk radius @xmath25 where @xmath19 is maximum .",
    "the frequencies of the growing hydrodynamic modes match the test - particle frequency branches @xmath29 and @xmath26 in the limit of small hydrodynamic corrections .",
    "the same modes grow in the @xmath30 range .",
    "the difference between the two consecutive frequency bands of the growing modes is @xmath31 which corresponds to the frequency separations @xmath32 and @xmath33 at @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively @xcite .",
    "note that the estimations of the brm for the peak separation of the growing mode frequencies are in agreement with the distribution of the @xmath36 values observed for the relatively slowly rotating neutron stars with spin frequencies below @xmath37 hz @xcite .",
    "the frequencies of the modes which grow in amplitude at any particular radius in the br increase all together as the local sound speed @xmath38 increases @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field strengths of neutron stars in lmxbs are generally thought to be weak enough for the radiation pressure to be important in the innermost disk regions . for a radiation pressure dominated inner disk , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the mass inflow rate in the inner disk @xcite .",
    "we expect , in accordance with the correlations of the khz qpo frequencies , that the growing mode frequencies correlate with the x - ray luminosity @xmath41 .",
    "figure  @xmath42 exhibits the correlation between the frequencies @xmath3 and @xmath2 of two consecutive modes growing at the innermost disk radius @xmath43 and the correlation between the frequency difference @xmath44 and the upper mode frequency @xmath2 of the same modes estimated by the brm @xcite for a putative neutron star with a spin frequency @xmath45 hz .",
