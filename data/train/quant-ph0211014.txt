    "for example , bound entanglement exists only for the former @xcite , and for two qutrits there is even `` nonlocality without entanglement '' @xcite .    in this paper , we consider quantum systems which have subsystems of dimension @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is prime . as a shorthand",
    ", we will use the term `` qudit '' .",
    "quantum codes for qudit systems have been studied , e.g. , in @xcite . the question of encoding and decoding these codes , however , was not explicitly addressed . here",
    "we present efficient ( classical ) algorithms to compute efficient quantum networks for the encoding process .",
    "the method applies to qubit codes as well , for which encoding algorithms have been discussed , e.g. , in @xcite .    in the following section",
    ", we present the mathematical framework of quantum information processing using composed quantum systems . in section  [ sec : qecc ] we recall the basic concepts and constructions of quantum error - correcting codes . a first encoding algorithm for the class of css codes is presented in section  [ sec : css ] .",
    "the main result , an encoding algorithm for stabilizer codes over higher dimensional quantum - systems , is derived in section  [ sec : jacobi ] and illustrated in section  [ sec : example ] .",
    "in the context of classical information processing , information is encoded using words over some finite alphabet @xmath6 , most often @xmath7 .",
    "the elementary `` symbols '' of quantum information processing are states of a finite dimensional quantum system .",

    "in the following , we will recall the basic properties and constructions of quantum error - correcting codes . in order to construct an error - correcting code",
    ", one has to specify an error model .",
    "the error model can be specified by a ( finite ) set @xmath61 of error operators . in @xcite , the following characterization of error - correcting codes",

    "the error acting on a single subsystem can be any linear transformation .",
    "it is sufficient that condition ( [ eq : knilllaflamme ] ) holds for a basis of the linear space of error operators . for qudit systems of prime power dimension @xmath31 ,",
    "we consider the following set of unitary operators : @xmath71 it is not hard to show that those @xmath72 operators are an orthogonal basis with respect to the inner product @xmath73 .",
    "furthermore , they generate an error group @xmath74 of size @xmath75 with center @xmath76 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "any element of @xmath74 can uniquely be written as @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the commutation relations of two elements are derived from @xmath80 hence commuting two elements results in a phase factor , i.e. , @xmath81 for an @xmath1-qudit system , the error basis and the error group are the @xmath1-fold tensor products @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "the weight of an error - operator @xmath84 is the number of tensor factors that are different from identity . if a @xmath85-dimensional subspace @xmath62 of @xmath86 can correct all errors of weight no greater than @xmath87",
    ", @xmath62 is a @xmath87-error - correcting code with minimum distance @xmath88 , denoted by @xmath89 .",
    "a particular class of quantum error - correcting codes are so - called stabilizer codes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the basic idea is to consider an abelian subgroup @xmath90 of the error group @xmath91 such that its intersection with the center of @xmath92 is trivial .",
    "the stabilizer code @xmath62 is defined as the common eigenspace of the operators in @xmath90 .",

    "from the commutation relation ( [ eq : commute ] ) , it follows that for @xmath100 @xmath101 where the inner product @xmath102 is defined by @xmath103 this shows that the group @xmath104 is isomorphic to @xmath105 .",
    "furthermore , two elements @xmath96 and @xmath106 commute if and only if @xmath107 .",
    "hence an abelian subgroup @xmath108 of @xmath91 corresponds to a subspace @xmath109 of @xmath105 that is contained in its dual @xmath110 with respect to the inner product ( [ eq : traceip ] ) .",

    "finally , the minimum distance of a stabilizer code is the minimum weight of the vectors @xmath122 , since the errors corresponding to @xmath110 are those that can not be detected , and the operators corresponding to @xmath109 have no effect on the code .",

    "as @xmath144 is in row echelon form , this corresponds to a sequence of modified @xmath153 gates  instead of adding the first qudit to the second , we have to add a multiple of it .",
    "the resulting encoding circuit is shown in figure  [ fig : cssencoding ] .",

    "the corresponding stabilizer code @xmath176 can not correct single qudit errors at arbitrary positions as the common eigenstates of @xmath177 are tensor products of the fixed @xmath178-qudit state @xmath179 and the unencoded state @xmath180 , i.e. , they are of the form @xmath181 as the stabilizer groups @xmath90 and @xmath173 are conjugated to each other there exists a transformation @xmath182 such that @xmath183 where @xmath184 denotes equality up to the permutation @xmath185 of the qudits . combining ( [ eq : code0 ] ) and ( [ eq : conjugation ] ) , it follows that the states @xmath186 are common eigenstates of @xmath90 .",
