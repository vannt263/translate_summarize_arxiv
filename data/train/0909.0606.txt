    "charge transport normally takes place in some background medium . to understand how the environment affects the moving carrier and",
    "vice versa is a difficult question and in this generality at present perhaps one of the most heavily debated issues in condensed matter physics . here",
    "the term `` background '' describes a variety of situations .",
    "we can think of the motion of a hole through an ordered insulator  @xcite .",
    "examples are the high-@xmath0 cuprates and the colossal magnetoresistive manganates , with a background of spins and orbitals , respectively , forming a pattern of alternating order .",
    "then , as the hole moves , it disrupts the order of the background , which on its part hinders the particle transfer .",
    "nevertheless coherent particle transport may occur , but on a strongly renormalized energy scale .",
    "the new quasiparticles formed in the cuprates and manganates are spin or orbital polarons  @xcite .",
    "another situation concerns a charge carrier coupled to a deformable background . here ,",
    "if the interaction with phonons is strong , the particle has to carry a phonon cloud through the medium . the outcome might be a `` self - trapped '' small lattice polaron  @xcite . in this case hopping",
    "transport , accompanied by phonon emission and absorption processes , evolves as the dominant transport channel .",
    "so far we have considered a single particle only .",
    "it is quite obvious that the problem becomes even more involved if the particle density increases .",
    "then the inter - relation between charge carriers and background medium may drive quantum phase transitions .",
    "the appearance of ferromagnetism in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) manganates , superconductivity in the quasi-2d cuprates , or charge - density - wave ( cdw ) states in 1d halogen - bridged transition metal complexes are prominent examples  @xcite . in the theoretical description of these strongly correlated systems an additional difficulty arises : the particles which are responsible for charge transport and the order phenomena of the background are the same . as a consequence , on a microscopic level ,",
    "rather involved many - particle models result , which incorporate the coupling between charge , spin , orbital and lattice degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "naturally this prevents an exact solution of the problem even in reduced dimensions .",
    "a way out might be the construction of simplified transport models , which capture the basic mechanisms of quantum transport in a background medium in an effective way . along this line",
    "a novel quantum transport model has been proposed recently  @xcite , @xmath1 which mimics the correlations inherent to a spinful fermionic many - particle systems by a boson affected hopping of spinless particles @xmath2 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : model ] ) . in the model  ( [ model ] ) , a fermion @xmath3 creates ( or absorbs ) a local boson @xmath4 every time it hops , which corresponds to a local excitation in the background with a certain energy @xmath5 . because of quantum fluctuations the distortions are able to relax @xmath6 .",
    "a unitary transformation @xmath7 replaces this term by second transport channel @xmath8 , describing unaffected fermionic transfer , however with a renormalized amplitude @xmath9 .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that coherent propagation of a fermion is possible even in the limit @xmath10 by means of a six - step vacuum - restoring hopping process , @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "note that @xmath14 acts as direct next neareast neighbor ( nnn ) transfer `` @xmath15 '' , in complete analogy to the `` trugman path '' of a hole in a 2d nel - ordered spin background  @xcite .",
    "the model  ( [ model ] ) has been solved in the single particle sector ( @xmath16 ) by exact diagonalization  @xcite , using a basis construction for the fermion - boson ( many - particle ) hilbert space that is variational for an infinite lattice ( @xmath17 )  @xcite .",
    "the transport behavior was found to be surprisingly complex , reflecting the properties of both spin and lattice polarons in @xmath18-@xmath19- and holstein - type models .    )",
    "describes a very general situation : as a charge carrier ( @xmath20 ) moves along a 1d transport path it creates an excitation with energy @xmath5 ( @xmath21 ) in the background medium at the site it leaves or annihilates an existing excitation at the site it enters .",
    "it is a plausible assumption that the ( de)excitation of the background can be parameterized as a bosonic degree of freedom . in the case of spin deviations , orbital fluctuations or lattice vibrations ,",
    "the bosons might be viewed as a schwinger - bosons , orbitons or phonons .",
    "of course , any distortion of the background can heal out by quantum fluctuations .",
    "accordingly the @xmath22-term allows for spontaneous boson creation and annihilation processes .",
    "the upper panel displays the single - particle case . depending on the model parameters quasi - free , diffusive or boson - assisted transport takes place  @xcite .",
    "the latter case corresponds e.g. to the motion of a hole through an ordered antiferromagnetic insulator .",
    "the lower panel shows the half - filled band case . here , for spinless fermions in 1d , a repulsive tomonaga - luttinger liquid evolves , provided the excitations of the background are energetically inexpensive ( @xmath23 ) or will readily relax ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this defines the fluctuation dominated regime .",
    "by contrast , strong background correlations , which develop for large @xmath5 and small @xmath25 tend to immobilize the charge carriers and even may drive a metal insulator transition by establishing cdw long - range order  @xcite . [",
    "fig : model ] ]    for the 1d half - filled band sector ( @xmath26 ) , evidence for a metal insulator transition comes from small cluster diagonalizations  @xcite .",
    "quite recently the ground - state phase diagram of the model  ( [ model ] ) has been mapped out in the whole @xmath22-@xmath5 plane  @xcite , using a density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) technique  @xcite . a quantum phase transition between a tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) and cdw",

    "the required cpu time increases rapidly with the number of the density - matrix eigenstates @xmath61 .",
    "since the ddmrg approach is based on a variational principle  @xcite , we first of all have to prepare a good `` trial function '' for the ground state with as many density - matrix eigenstates as possible . as a rule",
    "we keep @xmath62 states to obtain the true ground state in the first five ddmrg sweeps and afterwards take @xmath63 states for the calculation of the various spectra from  ( [ dynresp ] ) with a broadening @xmath64 . in order to save cpu time in the ddmrg",

    "the free transport channel nevertheless dominates and an almost particle - hole symmetric spectrum ( @xmath72 ) results ( see fig .",

    "the introduced hole can only move coherently by the 6-step process  ( [ 6-step ] ) , where in step 1 - 3 three bosons were excited , which are consumed in steps 4 - 6 afterwards . in this way",
    "the collective particle - boson dynamics leads to a flattening of the `` coherent '' band for @xmath75 .",
    "by contrast an additional electron , which probes the unoccupied states in an inverse ( i)pe experiment ( @xmath76 ) , can more easily move by a two - step process , even if pronounced cdw correlations exist in the background medium  @xcite .",
    "the incoherent parts of @xmath77 far away from the fermi energy @xmath78 are caused by excitations with additional bosons involved ( bear in mind that the ground state with @xmath41 electrons is a multi - phonon state and the wave vector of the @xmath44 target state corresponds to the total momentum of electrons and bosons ) .",
    "while for @xmath73 , @xmath79 has finite spectral weight at @xmath78 , i.e. the system is still metallic ( albeit the tll charge exponent @xmath80 is noticeably reduced from one  @xcite ) , an excitation gap opens in the pe spectrum as @xmath22 falls below a certain critical value , provided that @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath82 .",

    "cdw quantum phase transition is driven by the correlations that might evolve in the background medium at commensurate fillings .",
    "let us emphasize the dynamical aspect of this process : the ( collective ) bosonic excitations are intimately connected to the motion of the particles , and themselves have to persist long enough in order to affect the many - particle state .     in the half - filled band sector of the fermion - boson transport model  ( [ model ] ) on a @xmath84site chain .",
    "the upper two rows ( lower row ) give ddmrg data for @xmath85 and @xmath86 in the metallic regime ( @xmath83 , insulating regime ) , where @xmath71 .",

    "again @xmath84 ( obc ) , @xmath83 , but now @xmath90 . ]    the arpes spectrum for the insulating state clearly shows the doubling of the brillouin zone . the remaining asymmetry with regard to the spectral weight of the absorption signals as @xmath91 vanishes for @xmath92 .",
    "most notably the widths of the highest pe and lowest ipe coherent bands differ by a factor of about @xmath93 , since the cdw order is restored if the injected hole [ electron ] is transfered to a nnn site by a process of order @xmath94 [ @xmath95 .",
    "hence the cdw state exhibits a correlation - induced asymmetric band structure  @xcite .",
    "the strong interrelation of charge dynamics and background fluctuations becomes obvious if we decrease @xmath5 below @xmath96 keeping @xmath83 fixed .",
    "of course , in passing the accompanied insulator - metal transition the pe spectrum changes completely , but the `` nature '' of the tll at @xmath90 is different compared to that of the metallic state realized at larger @xmath5 and @xmath22 as well ( cf .",

    "is smeared out ( over - damped ) , i.e. here the dynamics of the system is dominated by bosonic fluctuations .",
    "the different transport behavior becomes also apparent in the momentum distribution function @xmath100 by means of dmrg , the ground - state correlation function @xmath101 can be easily calculated for pbc .",

    "the tll - cdw transition causes significant changes in the functional form of @xmath102 . for @xmath103 ,",

    "@xmath106 rapidly decreases approaching the cdw transition point with decreasing @xmath22 ( see data for @xmath71 ( red squares ) ) . in the cdw phase the singularity at @xmath97 vanishes .",
    "note that the periodicity of @xmath102 doubles at @xmath107 , in accordance with a @xmath108 nnn - only hopping channel . to substantiate this reasoning we have included in fig .",

    "the upturn in @xmath102 for @xmath111 persists even in the metallic regime as long as nnn hopping processes triggered by the ( cdw ) correlations in the background are of importance .    for @xmath90",

    "so to speak the system behaves as a nearly perfect metal at this point .",
    "it is worth to mention that an increase in @xmath102 for both @xmath114 and @xmath115 has been found also for the momentum distribution function of the hubbard model ( with and without magnetization ) using the gutzwiller variational wave function  @xcite .",

    "that is the cdw phase typifies rather as a correlated insulator  such as the mott - hubbard insulator  and no divergence occurs at the optical absorption threshold  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have determined the spectral properties of a highly non - trivial two - channel fermion - boson transport model for the 1d half - filled band case , using an unbiased ddmrg technique .",
    "the background medium , parameterized by bosonic degrees of freedom , strongly influences the charge carrier dynamics , as it happens in many novel materials .",

    "in opposite case of strong background correlations coherent quantum transport may evolve on a reduced energy scale .",
    "these correlations can also trigger a metal insulator transition .",
    "the insulating cdw state has a asymmetric band structure , leading to characteristic signatures in the arpes and optical response . whether an extended model with spinful fermions gives rise to an attractive metallic phase like in the holstein - hubbard model  @xcite would be an interesting question for further research",
