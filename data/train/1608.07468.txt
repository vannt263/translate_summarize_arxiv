    "pairwise comparisons are among the classical ways of decison making and information checking .",
    "the main idea is simple : assign a score to the comparison of a pair @xmath0 of two states which have to be compared , and we say that the `` scores '' are consistent if , for three states @xmath1 , the comparison of @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be deduced from the comparisons of @xmath2 and @xmath4 and of @xmath5 and @xmath6 if not , the comparisons are called inconsistent .",
    "these aspects are precised in section [ 2.1 . ] , and gives so many applications that it is impossible to cite them all .",
    "we mention two of them @xcite which are applications of deep interest .",
    "this is mostly why some authors have developed ways to quantify inconsistency @xcite , see e.g. @xcite , and there exists actually tentatives of axiomatizations of the so - called `` inconsistency indicators '' @xcite .",
    "one can also try to deal with partial orders , after @xcite , motivated by the obvious lack of informations when one tries to express a complex situation only by a score .",
    "this leads us to the main motivation of this work .",
    "dealing with partial orders can turn out to be very complex ( see e.g. the tables in @xcite ) , where as ( non abelian ) groups furnish a minimal setting where composition and inversion are well - defined , with all the necessary properties for comparisons of more complex datas .",
    "let us now describe the contents of this paper .",
    "section 2 describes pairwise comparisons matrices with coefficients in a group @xmath7 indexed by any ( finite or infinite ) set of states @xmath8 we define also what is an inconsistency map .",
    "the terminology of inconsistency indicator is reserved to inconsistency maps with additionnal properties , and the settings developed will be justified by other parts of this work .",
    "section 3 deals with algebraic properties of consistency .",
    "we highlight adjoint action of the group @xmath9 , called gauge group by analogy with differentail geometric settings @xcite , on the set of pairwise comparisons matrices .",
    "the key property states that consistency is characterized by an orbit of this group .",
    "the side - properties are then described , which motivates the vocabulary for properties of inconsistency maps , and leads to the terminology of inconsistency indicator . as a concluding property ,",
    "we show that koczkodaj s inconistency map is an adjoint - invariant inconsistency indicator .",
    "we are aware that a similar study , based on a deep understanding of the properties of saaty s inconsistency map @xcite , is actually investigated by others .",
    "section 4 is devoted to examples .",
    "the first natural example which arises for the group @xmath10 is @xmath11 ( section 4.1 ) , and show that 3d - perspective can be understood as inconsistency with coefficients in the affine group of @xmath12 ( section 4.2 )    section 5 deals with generalization on graphs .",
    "this happens when two states can not be compared by direct comparisons , but only by comparisons with intermediate states .",
    "this leads to `` holes '' in the pairwise comparisons matrices , assigned to the coefficient `` 0 '' , and the notion of holonomy enables us to extend koczkodaj s inconsistency maps to a @xmath13-$]valued inconsistency map , which is adjoint - invariant .",
    "it is easy to explain the inconsistency in pairwise comparisons when we consider cycles of three comparisons , called triad and represented here as @xmath15 , which do not have the `` morphism of groupoid '' property such as @xmath16 evidently , the inconsistency in a triad @xmath15 is somehow ( not linearly ) proportional to @xmath17 in the linear space , the inconsistency is measured by the `` approximate flatness '' of the triangle . the triad is consistent if the triangle is flat .",
    "for example , @xmath18 and @xmath19 have the difference @xmath20 but the inconsistency in the first triad is unacceptable.it is acceptable in the second triad . in order to measure inconsistency",
    ", one usually considers coefficients @xmath21 with values in an abelian group @xmath7 with al least 3 indexes @xmath22 the use of `` inconsistency '' has a meaning of a measure of inconsistency in this study ; not the concept itself .",
    "the approach to inconsistency ( originated in @xcite and generalized in @xcite ) can be reduced to a simple observation :    * search all triads ( which generate all 3 by 3 pc submatrices ) and locate the worse triad with a so - called inconsistency indicator ( @xmath23 ) , * @xmath23 of the worse triad becomes @xmath23 of the entire pc matrix .    expressing it a bit more formally in terms of triads ( the upper triangle of a pc submatrix @xmath24 ) , we have : @xmath25    according to @xcite , it is equivalent to : @xmath26 the expression @xmath27 is the distance of the triad @xmath28 from 0 . when this distance increases , the @xmath29 also increases .",
    "it is important to notice here that this definition allows us to localize the inconsistency in the matrix pc and it is of a considerable importance for most applications .",
    "another possible definition of the inconsistency indicator can also be defined ( following @xcite ) as : @xmath30    since the matrix @xmath31 is consistent if and only if for any @xmath32 the following equation holds : @xmath33    it is equivalent to : @xmath34    the first koczkodaj s indicator @xmath35 allows us not only find the localization of the worst inconsistency but to reduce the inconsistency by a step - by - step process which is crucial for practical applications .",
    "the second koczkodaj s indicator @xmath36 is useful when the global inconsistency indicator is needed for acceptance or rejection of the pc matrix .",
    "a hybrid of two @xmath23 definitions may be considered in applications , and an abstract unification will be discussed in the last section .",
    "in the previous section , the comparisons coefficients are @xmath21 are scaling coefficients .",
    "this means that , if the pc matrix @xmath31 is coherent , given a state @xmath37 we can recover all the other states @xmath38 by something assimilated to scalar mutiplication : @xmath39 in other words , even if the states @xmath38 are drven by more complex rules , we reduce them to a `` score '' or an `` evaluation '' in @xmath40 this is useless to say that such an approach is highly reductive : even in video games , the virtual fighters have more than one characteristic : health , speed , strength , mental ... and the global design of these characteristics intends to refect some `` complexity '' in the game ( please note the `` ' ' ) .",
    "so tat , the states @xmath38 have to belong to a more complex state space @xmath41 and in order to have pairwise comparisons , a straightforard study shows that we define @xcite a semi - category @xmath42 with set of objects @xmath43 and such that morphisms @xmath44 must satisfy the following properties :    * there exists an identity morphism * if @xmath45 then there exists @xmath46 * any morphism acts on any state , which can be rephrased in the language of categories by : the semi - category is total .",
    "thus , gathering the necessary properties of @xmath47 we get :    @xmath44 is a group .",
    "then we have that the minimal setting for generalizing pairwise comparisons is given by actions on @xmath48 by a group @xmath7 which leads to the folloing setting .",
    "let @xmath49 be a set of indexes and let @xmath50be a field with absolute value and @xmath51 a normed @xmath52vector space .",
    "[ pcig ] @xcite let @xmath53 be a group .",
    "a * pairwise comparisons matrix * is a matrix @xmath54 such that    1 .",
    "@xmath55 2 .",
    "[ inverse ] @xmath56 3 .",
    "[ diagonal ] @xmath57    we note by @xmath58 the set of pairwise comparisons matrices indexed by @xmath49 and with coefficients in @xmath59 when @xmath10 is not abelian , there are two notions of inconsistency :    * @xmath31 is * covariantly consistent * if and only if @xmath60 * @xmath31 is * contravariantly consistent * if and only if @xmath61    contravariant consistency appears in the geometric realization of @xmath58 via the holonomy of a connection on a simplex @xcite , but we give the following easy remark :    let @xmath62 be a contravariant pc - matrix .",
    "then the @xmath63matrix @xmath64 defined by @xmath65 is a covariant pc matrix .",
    "this shows that the two notions are dual , and we concentrate our efforts on covariant consistency , that we call * consistency * , in the rest of the paper .",
    "a ( non normalized , non covariant ) inconsistency map is a map @xmath66 such that @xmath67 if @xmath31 is consistent .",
    "moreover , we say that @xmath23 is faithful if @xmath68 implies that @xmath31 is consistent .",
    "we note by @xmath69 the set of consistent pc - matrices .",
    "after that , since @xmath51 is a vector space equipped with a semi - norm , the semi - norm will give us the  score \" of inconsistency , as in the previous section .",
    "the main feature in applying this setting will be twofold , and these two points are far to be systematically solved with the present work :    - define a comparisons group @xmath10 for which we can get at least one comparison coefficient @xmath21 between two states @xmath70 and @xmath38 ( which means that the @xmath63action needs to be transitive ) ,    - evaluate ( and compute ! ) inconsistency , if possible generalizing the @xmath71-setting , in a proper way to get safe decision making .",
    "this second point is linked with multiscale analysis .",
    "let us develop examples which can highlight these features , after developping the algebraic setting .",
    "first , we give the following easy proposition :    any morphism of group @xmath72 extends to a map @xmath73 by action on the coefficients , and :    * if @xmath74 is consistent , then @xmath75is consistent . * if @xmath76 then @xmath74 is consistent , if and only if @xmath75    we call @xmath9 the * gauge group * of @xmath7 following @xcite",
    ". then we get the following actions :    * a left action @xmath77 defined , for @xmath78 and @xmath79 by @xmath80 with @xmath81 * a right action @xmath82 defined , for @xmath78 and @xmath79 by @xmath83 with @xmath84 * an adjoint action @xmath85 * a coadjoint action @xmath86    these actions are obviously invariant under increasing re - indexation .",
    "let us recall the following theorem from @xcite prove when @xmath87    [ th1 ] when @xmath88 @xmath89    we rephrase it the following way , extending it to any totally ordered set of indexes @xmath49 :    [ th1 ] consistent pc - matrices are the orbits of the pc - matrix @xmath90 with respect to the adjoint action .",
    "let @xmath91 be a consistent pc matrix .",
    "let @xmath92 be a fixed index , and set @xmath93 since @xmath31 is consistent , @xmath94    let us give the following trivial proposition :    @xmath95 and @xmath96 are effective actions .",
    "one can wonder whether @xmath95 and @xmath96 are free or transitive .",
    "let us consider the following `` layered cake '' example :    let @xmath97 let us consider the matrix @xmath98 let us calcuate the orbit of @xmath31 with respect to the left action ( with the special case @xmath10 is abelian . )",
    "let @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 in this example , @xmath102 is not acting , so that @xmath95 is not free",
    ". let us solve @xmath103 we get the uncompatible equations : @xmath104 so that @xmath31 is not in the orbit of @xmath105 for the left action , and hence the left action is not transitive .",
    "however , one could wonder whether the orbits of the left action intersect @xmath106 with the same example ,    let us try to solve `` @xmath107 is consistent '' , we get @xmath108 which gives @xmath109 this gives a one parameter family of solutions @xmath110 generalizing this , we give :    if @xmath111 any orbit for the left action intersects @xmath112 if @xmath113 there exists orbits for the left action which do not intersect @xmath114    let @xmath115 and @xmath116 @xmath117    we want to find @xmath118 in order to make @xmath107 consistent . we get the following relation , among others : @xmath119 which gives @xmath120 this condition gives the consistent pc - matrix : @xmath121 let us now consider @xmath122 and @xmath123 then @xmath124 we then apply the procedure given for @xmath125 pc matrices on the diagonal @xmath126 blocks .",
    "this gives , for @xmath127 @xmath128 and reporting this equality in the matrix , we get @xmath129 so that , consistency now depends on the first line and the first column , and we get the relations : @xmath130 after simplifying @xmath131 we gather the two lines give the same condition @xmath132 this condition is not fulfilled , unless in very special cases . for an arbitrary @xmath133 with @xmath134",
    "we extract a @xmath135pc - matrix to get the same result .",
    "let us now turn to other properties inconsistency maps .",
    "let @xmath23 be an inconsistency map .",
    "it is called :    * * normalized * if @xmath136 * * ad - invariant * if @xmath137 * * norm invariant * if @xmath138is ad - invariant .",
    "let @xmath139 be the quotient space for the adjoint action of the gauge group on @xmath140 next result is a classical factorization theorem :    an ad - invariant inconsistency map @xmath23 factors in an unique way through the maps @xmath141 where    - @xmath142 is the quotient projection    - @xmath143    we give also the following easy proposition :    morphisms of groups are acting by pull - back on inconsistecy indicators .",
    "moreover , the pull - back of a normalized ( resp .",
    "@xmath144invariant ) inconsistency map is a a normalized ( resp .",

    ", we give now the following definition :    an inconsistency indicator @xmath23 on @xmath58 is a faithful , normalized inconsistency map with values in @xmath145 such that there exists an inconsistency map @xmath146 on @xmath147 that defines @xmath23 by the following formula @xmath148    we remark here that since @xmath23 is faithful , it is in particular ( trivially ) @xmath144invariant on @xmath149 but we do not require it to be @xmath144invariant .",
