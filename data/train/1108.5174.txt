    "a stellar mass black hole or neutron star executes @xmath0 orbits during the final year of inspiral toward a @xmath1 supermassive black hole ( mbh ) .",
    "the large number of cycles implies that a phase - coherent measurement of the inspiral , achievable through detection of low frequency gravitational waves , would be a tremendously powerful probe of the spacetime near a black hole @xcite . among other things",
    ", it would enable a precise determination of the spin of the supermassive black hole , and a test of general relativity that is independent of current constraints derived from pulsar timing data .",
    "there is no foreseeable instrument sensitive enough to detect gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals ( emris ) over time scales comparable to the orbital period . as a consequence , realizing the astrophysical and gravitational physics promise of emris requires an assurance that the inspiral can be accurately modeled over many orbits using templates calculated by solving the 2-body problem in general relativity ( for a review , see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is therefore necessary to assess whether gas , stars or other compact objects in the vicinity , could significantly perturb emri trajectories . in the case of gas ,",
    "perturbations to stellar mass black holes or neutron stars are securely negligible provided that accretion on to the black hole occurs in a low density , radiatively inefficient flow @xcite .",
    "such flows are much more common than dense accretion discs , which _ would _ yield observable phase shifts during inspiral @xcite , at least at the relatively low redshifts where emris may be observed .    in this letter",
    ", we quantify the nature and strength of possible perturbations from point mass perturbers : low mass stars or compact objects in tight orbits around the supermassive black hole .",
    "any perturbers are unlikely to orbit close enough to the emri to undergo strong interactions , so the regime of interest is one where the third body is relatively distant and the interaction weak .",
    "the newtonian analog of this problem has been studied extensively in the context both of solar system satellite evolution , and for transit timing variations of extrasolar planets @xcite . in newtonian gravity , perturbations are strong only at the location of mean motion resonances , and these have the effect of inducing small jumps in eccentricity upon divergent resonance crossing .",
    "this would already be interesting for the emri problem , since the jumps in eccentricity would result in a perturbation to the gravitational wave decay rate , and an eventual dephasing of the waveform .",
    "however , as we will see , the inclusion of post - newtonian corrections changes the evolution qualitatively .",
    "computing trajectories that include the two first - order non - dissipative post - newtonian corrections , we find evidence of dependence on initial conditions in the evolution of the perturbed inner binary , such that arbitrarily small variations in the initial orbit lead to significantly different future behaviour .",
    "is it likely that a star or compact object will be present close enough to perturb the orbit of an emri ? excluding low mass mbhs ( @xmath2 ) , where the stellar tidal disruption limit comes into play ,",
    "the existence of perturbers is not excluded by elementary arguments . neither , however , is it easy to calculate the probability distribution of perturbers , whose proximity will depend upon the details of discreteness and relativistic effects very close to the mbh , and mass segregation and emri injection mechanisms in galactic nuclei @xcite .    rather than face these difficulties , we limit ourselves here to order of magnitude estimates for the likely location of the nearest star and compact object . for stars , assumed to be of a single mass @xmath3",
    ", we assume a cusp - like distribution with density profile @xmath4 , extending from the mbh to its radius of influence @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 is the velocity dispersion of the galaxy .",
    "using the fact that the enclosed mass , @xmath7 at @xmath8 , we find that the expected radius of the innermost star , @xmath9 , is , @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "this formula yields an explicit estimate for @xmath9 once we adopt a relation between @xmath12 and @xmath6 @xcite . for the location of the next nearest compact object ( or emri ) , we use an even simpler approach .",
    "we calculate the expected semi - major axis for uncorrelated inspirals due to gravitational radiation @xcite , assuming near - circular orbits and rate @xmath13 .",
    "finally , we plot the tidal limit ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for @xmath14 main - sequence stars .    .",
    "the red lines show the location of the innermost star , estimated assuming that stars of mass @xmath14 follow a single power - law cusp of index @xmath15 in a galaxy on the @xmath12-@xmath6 relation .",
    "the green line shows the tidal disruption limit for such stars .",
    "the blue lines show the average ( upper ) and 1% probability ( lower ) location of the next nearest emri , assuming uncorrelated inspirals at a rate of @xmath16 . ]",
    "figure  [ fig.r_1 ] shows these estimates as a function of @xmath12 . for a standard cusp slope @xmath17",
    ", there is likely to be a low mass stellar perturber within a few hundred @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "similarly , if the emri rate is as high as @xmath16 , there is a significant chance ( at least a few percent ) that a second compact object will be present between @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "clearly , these crude estimates do not demonstrate that _ most _ emris will be perturbed by third bodies , but they do suggest that perturbers may be close enough in some galaxies to motivate detailed consideration of their dynamical effects .",
    "we are interested in the secular effect of a star acting on an emri which will describe thousands of orbits in the detector bandwidth and slowly decay .",
    "the kind of effects on the wave that we are looking at are tiny , though detectable , and the mass difference between the two binaries ( the mbh - emri and the mbh - star systems ) is huge . we need therefore a numerical tool capable of integrating the plunging orbit of the emri while inducing a minimal error in the integration , since data analysis techniques can detect e.g. eccentricity differences of the order @xmath22 @xcite . we hence have chosen to use a direct @xmath23body approach  @xcite , the planet code , written by aarseth .",
    "this is the most expensive method because it involves integrating all gravitational forces for all three bodies at every time step , without making any a priori assumptions about the system .",
    "our approach employs the improved hermite integration scheme , which requires computation of not only the accelerations but also their time derivatives . since we are simply integrating newton s equations directly",
    ", all gravitational effects are included .",
    "for the purpose of our study , nonetheless , we have included relativistic corrections to the newtonian forces ( the forces can be found in the same page in the toy code ) .",
    "this was first implemented in a direct - summation @xmath23body code by @xcite . for this",
    ", one has to add perturbations in the integration , so that the forces are modified by    @xmath24    in the last equation `` pn '' stands for post - newtonian .",
    "we note that the perturbations do not need to be small compared to the two - body force @xcite .",
    "the expressions for @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be found in @xcite , their equation 7.16 .",
    "we first analyse the system by contemplating only the relativistic effect of dissipation of energy ; i.e. our simulations only incorporate the 2.5 pn correction term .",
    "we stop the integration when the separation between the stellar bh and the mbh is @xmath28 , which approximately corresponds to the limit where the pn approximation is not valid anymore .",
    "the inspiral down to this distance takes typically in our simulations some 440,000 orbits .    in fig.([fig.25pn ] ) the test stellar black hole of mass @xmath29 has been initially set in such an orbit that it is totally embedded in a lisa - like detector band ( i.e. with an orbital period @xmath30 secs , namely @xmath31 secs ) and is hence an emri ; its initial semi - major axis is @xmath32 pc and its eccentricity @xmath33 .",
    "the perturber , a star of mass @xmath34 is initially on an orbit in which the semi - major axis has the value @xmath35 pc and the eccentricity at @xmath36 is @xmath37 .",
    "the inclination of the system emri  star was set to @xmath38 initially in the upper panel .",
    "this constitutes our reference system .    in the figure , the straight lines mark the condition @xmath39 , with @xmath40 an integer , @xmath41 the period of the star around the mbh and @xmath42 the period of the emri around the mbh ; i.e. where the resonances occur",
    "the first three resonances have an impact on @xmath43 which can be seen on the plot ; later resonances do also affect @xmath43 , with @xmath44 .",
    "we also note that in the upper panel one can see in - between smaller jumps ; they correspond to higher - order resonances , @xmath45 = 5.5 , 6.5 and 7.5 .",
    "we made the choice for an initial inclination of @xmath38 to avoid another effect that introduces a change in the eccentricity . in the lower panel",
    "we have _ exactly _ the same system but for @xmath46 . with this value , and the fact that the orbit is prograde , the kozai oscillation of eccentricity is present @xcite .",
    "even if the eccentricity of the emri @xmath43 suffers the characteristic kozai oscillations , the loci for the resonances still fulfill the condition @xmath47 .",
    "in this subsection we address numerically the effect of including the relativistic periapsis shift along with the dissipation of energy ; i.e. the set of corrections as specified in eq.([eq.f_pn ] ) .",
    "as we show below , the effect of the periapsis shift changes completely the evolution of the system . in fig.([fig.fiducial_1225pn_30_30billionth ] ) we show four cases .",
    "one of them corresponds to the reference system but taking into account the periapsis shift .",
    "we only display these examples but note that the behaviour is also chaotic for other nearby choices of @xmath48 . when using an initial inclination of @xmath46 , which corresponds to the same situation as in the lower panel of fig.([fig.25pn ] ) but taking into account the periapsis shift , along with another case which is identical but for @xmath49 , we find also a chaotic result which moreover eliminates the secular kozai oscillation of @xmath50 .",
    "we have systematically studied this chaotic behaviour by running hundreds of simulations in which we methodically increase in minimal differences an initial dynamical orbital parameter such as the inclination , semi - major axis or eccentricity . in all cases and parameters",
    "the evolution corroborates the chaotic behaviour of the system .",
    "we have also tested a mass for the perturbing star of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , as well as different values of @xmath53 ( 0.1 , 0.3 , 0.7 and 0.9 ) , with similar results .    in order to fence in the region",
    "within which the system is chaotic , we systematically increase the semi - major axis of the star and run the same experiment .",
    "we start with the same difference in inclination at a slightly larger semi - major axis , and then regularly increase it until we reach one order of magnitude over the fiducial case , as we depict in fig.([fig.fiducial_1225pn_30_30billionth_different_semimajor ] ) .",
    "the chaotic behaviour ceases at about one order of magnitude of the initial value of @xmath54 in the reference case .",
    "in this section we present a way of characterizing the rate of separation of infinitesimally close trajectories systematically . to achieve this we compare our fiducial model with another case in which we set up the emri in an ( almost ) imperceptibly different initial orbit ( the initial difference is @xmath55 pc , while the objects are moving on the same ellipse ) and keep the same initial conditions of the mbh and the perturber .",
    "hence emri in the second case differs only from the reference case slightly and has an initial distance separation of @xmath56 .",
    "we say that the two models are in phase provided that    @xmath57    if the two different realizations reach a separation    @xmath58    the emri bodies are moving out of phase , on entirely unrelated orbits .",
    "we thence are able to estimate a characteristic timescale @xmath59 for the system to become out of phase . in fig.([fig.movingpertfindinglimitschaos ] ) we display the separation of the two systems for different distances to the perturber . from these figures",
    "we can measure the value of a characteristic timescale @xmath60 for a given @xmath54 .    from the data points obtained in the upper panels of fig.([fig.movingpertfindinglimitschaos ] )",
    "we can then derive the relation displayed in the lower panel . for large enough distances , of the order of @xmath61 pc",
    "the two timescales converge and the system becomes deterministic .",
    "in this paper we have addressed the role of a perturbation on an emri by a nearby star .",
    "the system depends extremely on _ minimal _ changes in the initial conditions ( as small as a @xmath62 part in the inclination ) lead to a very different dynamical evolution . in all cases , however , the kozai mechanism is washed out by the periapsis shift , as one can expect ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for distances of the order of @xmath63",
    "pc the system enters the chaotic regime , for perturbing masses as small as @xmath52 .",
    "while we can not state clearly whether this will be a common feature for emris , since the different dynamical and relativistic phenomena involved in the problem are many and not straightforward ( see for a review @xcite and also @xcite for a dedicated review of the dynamics ) , it seems plausible that for a milky way - like galaxy a star can be at such a radius from the emri system that it will significantly perturb it . from the standpoint of detection and data analysis ,",
    "this is yet another complication of the problem and could even lead to the misinterpretation that nature s gr is not what we believe it to be . on the other hand , from the point of view of stellar dynamics , the detection of one of these systems would shed light on our current understanding of galactic dynamics in general and mass segregation in particular .",
