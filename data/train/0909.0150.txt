    "<S> we propose an efficient spin filter including an antidot fabricated on semiconductor heterostructures with strong spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the antidot creates a tunable potential on two - dimensional electron gas in the heterostructures , which may be attractive as well as repulsive . </S>",
    "<S> our idea is based on the enhancement of extrinsic spin hall effect by resonant scattering when the attractive potential is properly tuned . </S>",
    "<S> numerical studies for three- and four - terminal devices indicate that the efficiency of the spin filter can be more than 50% by tuning the potential to the resonant condition . </S>"
