    "furthermore , momentum space topology is also associated with electromagnetic or thermal polarization of these systems .",
    "for example , charge polarization @xcite is given by a momentum space integral of the berry connection and couples with electric fields .",
    "magnetoelectric polarization @xcite ( or called as the axion field ) @xmath2 characterizing the momentum space topology of band insulators gives rise to axion electrodynamics @xcite , in which magnetoelectric polarization @xmath2 couples with the electromagnetic field via @xmath3 . because @xmath4 is a total derivative , physical phenomena associated with @xmath5 arise only when @xmath2 is spatially or temporally inhomogeneous .",
    "a domain wall of @xmath2 leads to the anomalous hall effect and the image monopole effect .",
    "@xcite thermal or quantum fluctuations of the axion field @xmath2 also yield various interesting phenomena .",
    "for example , in a time - reversal invariant @xmath6 topological insulator in three dimension , inter - orbital antiferromagnetic fluctuations induce the dynamical axion field , which couples with electromagnetic fields , leading to an axionic polariton under an applied magnetic field @xcite and magnetic instability under an applied electrostatic field .",
    "@xcite    in the case of topological superconductors ( tscs ) , since charge , and also spin if the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) presents , are not conserved , it is difficult to detect topological characters in electromagnetic responses .",
    "however , thermal responses can be good probes for topological nontriviality because energy is still conserved .",

    "@xcite from analogy to the dynamical axion in the topological insulators , @xcite one can deduce that for tscs , the dynamical axion field in tscs can be provided by imaginary @xmath0-wave superconducting fluctuations , which break quantization of magnetoelectric polarization and lead to dynamics of @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite    in the present paper , we discuss the axion physics in tscs mainly focusing on dynamical effects , i.e. fluctuations of the axion field in tscs .",

    "the relation between the imaginary @xmath0-wave superconducting fluctuations and dynamical axion is clarified . in sec.[dy - axion ] , we consider a concrete microscopic model of a tsc in which the dynamical action appears at a sufficiently low - energy scale compared to the bulk superconducting gap , and clarify the effect of the soi raised by broken inversion symmetry , which makes low - energy dynamical axion more feasible . in sec.[dy - phe ] , we discuss experimentally observable phenomena driven by the dynamical axion in tsc .",
    "we conclude in sec.[conc ] with some remarks .",
    "in this section , we briefly review previous argument on topological action terms and effective internal energy related with thermal responses in tscs , which are the basis for dynamical axion phenomena . in tscs ,",
    "a conserved quantity is energy , and hence thermal responses can be used for probing the topological nontriviality . for translational invariant superfluids ,",
    "momentum is also a conserved current .",
    "probe fields which couple with energy - momentum tensor are metric . here",
    "we consider topological action terms which are constructed from the metric degrees of freedom , these action terms are known as the gravitational instanton term in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions and the gravitational chern - simons ( cs ) term in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "also , we introduce another type of a topological term which is related with the gravitoelectromagnetism and the torsional anomaly .",
    "@xcite      in two - dimensional systems , tscs characterized by the nontrivial chern number have the gravitational cs 3 form as a low - energy effective theory , @xcite @xmath11 with @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the fermi velocity , @xmath14 the spin connections determined by the metric and @xmath15 , which is the central charge of the ising conformal field theory .",

    "@xcite it is important to note that the gravitational cs term ( [ gcs ] ) does not directly lead to the thermal hall effect in ( 2 + 1 ) dimension , because ( [ gcs ] ) yields the energy current proportional to gradient of the ricci tensor which corresponds to a spatially second order differential of a temperature field .",

    ", an overall coefficient has a dimension of the square of energy , which is the same as the the torsional anomaly .",

    "@xcite we could not derive the action ( [ gemcs ] ) directly from microscopic hamiltonian of electron systems coupled with gravitoelectromagnetic fields .",
    "however , we deduce it from the analogy with the relation between the ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional electromagnetic cs action and the electric hall conductivity .",
    "it is still an important open issue to establish the low - energy effective field theory of the thermal hall effect .      for ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional tscs with time - reversal symmetry classified by the topological invariant @xmath8 ,",

    "@xcite it is noted that as in the case of the pure ( 2 + 1 ) gravitational cs action ( [ gcs ] ) , the action ( [ gcs2 ] ) does not directly lead to the bulk thermal hall effect .",

    "here we sketch the derivation of the gravitoelectromagnetic topological internal energy presented by nomura et al .",

    "they proved that the topological part of the internal energy for a tsc in a cylindrical geometry with a surface perturbation inducing mass gaps of the majorana fermions is expressed as , @xmath45 here @xmath46 is a velocity of surface majorana fermion and @xmath2 is a constant determined by the sign of mass gaps of the surface majorana fermions .",
    "they obtained this result from the calculations of the cross - correlated type response on the surface quasi - lorentz symmetric system : ( i ) an angular momentum induced by the temperature gradient along @xmath47-axis , and ( ii ) heat population induced by mechanical rotation .",
    "( [ gtop ] ) , ( [ gemtop ] ) and ( [ topfe ] ) imply that dynamics of the axion field @xmath2 give rise to dynamical thermal ( gravitational ) responses .",
    "we investigate such dynamical axion effects of tscs in the following .",
    "in this section , we summarize some basic properties of class diii tscs relevant to the following argument .",
    "the topological classification of class diii tscs is given by integers @xmath7 .",
    "however , the gravitational instanton term ( [ gtop ] ) describes only @xmath6 part , i.e. , the parity of topological invariant .",
    "also , the internal energy ( [ topfe ] ) is derived by assuming a priori the existence of @xmath8 majorana fermions on the surface . as in the case of the magnetoelectric polarization in topological insulators @xcite , in real systems , a non - topological even integer part of @xmath2 depends on the energy gap structure of the surface majorana fermions .",
    "hence it is possible to obtain the thermal conductivity exactly proportional to topological invariant @xmath8 by using a specific perturbation which generates mass gap @xmath48 of the @xmath49-th majorana fermion satisfying @xmath50 . for this perturbation , the ( gravito ) magnetoelectric polarization @xmath51",
    "actually , class diii tscs inherently have the appropriate perturbation that can be constructed from a chiral symmetric structure of class diii tscs : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is determined by the combination of a time - reversal transformation and a particle - hole transformation .",

    "is based on the surface half - integer thermal hall effect , which limits the applicability of ( [ topfe ] ) to the case with a quantized value of @xmath2 . however , the above observation that the @xmath7-part of @xmath2 coincides with the surface jump of the ( gravito ) magnetoelectric polarization @xmath73 defined by ( [ axion ] ) strongly suggests that non - quantized @xmath2 is given by @xmath73 as in the case of the axion electrodynamics . in this paper , we _ assume _ the topological action @xmath76 for _ non - quantized _ value of @xmath73 , and consider phenomena raised by the dynamical axion in tscs .",

    "in the case that @xmath79 is an integer , the surface thermal hall conductivity can be understood as contributions of surface massive majorana fermions which gives @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "however , non - quantized values of @xmath81 can not be derived from a pure ( 2 + 1)-dimensional surface effective theory .",
    "in fact , this comes from ( 3 + 1)-dimensional bulk wave functions .      before proceeding to the argument on dynamical axion , in this section , we clarify an important role of the chiral - symmetry breaking perturbation ( [ gammap ] ) , i.e. imaginary @xmath0-wave pairing in tscs .",
