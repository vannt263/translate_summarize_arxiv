    "in newton s theory of gravitation which reined for centuries , mass constituted the principal source for its potential . with the advent of general relativity",
    ", different sources were unified under spacetime texture such that the overall effective force used to matter .",
    "thus , gravity / geometry can easily be attributed to non - mass originated sources equally well due to the manifestation of mass - energy equivalence . as a particular example we recall the reissner - nordstrom ( rn ) geometry of general relativity in which mass and charge coexist in making the geometry .",
    "assuming that the source has negligible mass versus a significant charge the entire geometry can be attributed to the charge alone . in performing this process",
    "one should be cautious that no physical energy conditions are violated .",
    "recent observations suggest that there are dark matter / energy that is associated with non - observable sources . as a result",
    "our detectable /  observable matter falls rather short to account for the accelerated expansion of our universe .  before suggesting proposals for new forces / matter it is more logical to exhaust every kind of physical sources that we are at least familiar so that we know how to cope with . to explain the hierarchy of forces at small distances and close the gap of discrepancy between gravity and other fields , for instance",
    ", the idea of higher dimensions / branes was proposed @xcite .",
    "although no branes have been identified so far theoretical explanation such as dilution ( weaking ) of gravity among branes in higher dimensions remains consistently intact .",
    "as the gravity is tamed at uv scales by virtue of higher dimensions at the ir scales , or long distances does everything go perfect ? .",
    "the recent proposal @xcite that at large distances there is an additional parameter known as rindler acceleration was rather unprecedented and the present letter is about the source of such term .",
    "we recall that in the near horizon limit , i.e. @xmath0 for @xmath1 a schwarzschild black hole leads to the standard rindler acceleration .",
    "such an extraneous term must be purely general relativistic coupled with physical sources which lacks a newtonian counterpart . even in the einstein - maxwell version of general relativity with spherical symmetry",
    "such a term did not arise .",
    "the long range fields , i.e. gravitation and electromagnetism , manifest their inverse square law character so that asymptotically the spacetime becomes flat .",
    "different sources such as dilatons , nonlinear electromagnetic fields and others admit non asymptotically flat solutions at large spatial distances .",
    "the difficulty with the new rindler acceleration is that it violates both the newtonian and maxwellian limits : for large distances ( @xmath2 ) it becomes even more significant .",
    "in newtonian terms the potential that gives inverse force law modifies into @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the central newtonian mass and @xmath5 is the novel rindler acceleration under question . unless the central object is supermassive and @xmath5 is negligibly small",
    "it can be argued that for large @xmath6 the new term dominates over the mass term .",
    "further , the rindler acceleration is not a universal constant as observationally it shows slight variations from sun - pioneer pair ( @xmath7 natural unit of acceleration which is equivalent to @xmath8 in physical units ) to galaxy - sun system ( @xmath9 ) and others .",
    "we recall that such a linear dependence of potential on distance is encountered in parallel plates endowed with a uniform electric field in linear maxwell electromagnetism ( i.e. @xmath10 , @xmath11 constant ) .",
    "gravity coupled with linear maxwell electromagnetism in spherically symmetric geometry produces no such linear potential term either . for this reason we resort from the outset to nonlinear electrodynamics ( ned ) to generate the new acceleration term .",
    "truly it yields the required expression , however , in addition it gives as a by product an extra constant term in the metric which can be interpreted as a global monopole @xcite .",
    "this amounts to further modification of the newtonian potential by @xmath12 , with the global monopole term  @xmath13 constant .",
    "our formalism suggests that both the rindler acceleration ( @xmath5 ) and global monopole ( @xmath14 ) constants depend on the nonlinear electric charge of the heavenly object under consideration .",
    "that is , neither one is a fundamental constant of nature as both are derived from the charge .",
    "interestingly the monopole term plays the similar role of a cosmological constant , i.e. a uniform electric field in the presence of ned coupled gravity with nonisotropic difference .",
    "it is further shown that the monopole term is crucial for the weak and strong energy conditions to be satisfied .",
    "the spectrum of ned theories is very large and the problem is to find the proper lagrangian that suits and serves for the purpose .",
    "finally we observed that the rindler acceleration does nt account for the constant tangential velocity of circular orbits in the presence of mysterious dark matter .",
    "for this reason we have further modified the rindler term in the metric function by @xmath15 ( with @xmath5 and @xmath16 constant)@xmath17 which necessitates a new ned lagrangian .",
    "for such a magnetic lagrangian it is shown that the energy conditions are satisfied at the cost of a bounded universe .",
    "further , the circular orbit around remote galaxies , has velocity @xmath18 which yields a better estimate between newton and rindler acceleration models toward accounts of dark matter .",
    "recently , grumiller gave a metric to describe gravity of a central mass at large distances which attracted interest due to its cosmological implications @xcite .",
    "the novelty in this model is the inclusion of a term interpreted as rindler acceleration .",
    "we wish to show in this letter that nonlinear electrodynamics ( ned ) is responsible for the generation of such a term .",
    "our starting point is the action @xmath19\\]]in which @xmath20 ricci scalar , @xmath21 cosmological constant and @xmath22 is the lagrangian for the ned .",
    "our notation is such that @xmath23 represents the maxwell invariant with the choice of lagrangian @xmath24here @xmath25 is the coupling constant and @xmath26 plays the role of the uniform background electric field as will be clarified in the sequel .",
    "our model lagrangian ( 2 ) can be employed with the choice @xmath27 as well .",
    "note that @xmath28 is the standard maxwell field tensor and this lagrangian will break the scale invariance , i.e. @xmath29 @xmath30 for @xmath31 constant . we consider a static , spherically symmetric ( sss ) spacetime described by the line element @xmath32with the electric field ansatz @xmath33form @xmath34 the nonlinear maxwell equation @xmath35 admits the electric field@xmath36 in which @xmath37 and @xmath38 we note that the integration constant @xmath39 is identified as the total charge @xmath40 of the central object which is obtained from the gauss s law @xmath41 the solution of einstein - ned equations gives the following metric function@xmath42where @xmath43 , @xmath44 while @xmath45 mass and @xmath21 the cosmological constant , require no comments . as the expressions suggest @xmath46 and @xmath40 must have the same sign and the fact that the acceleration admits both signs has cosmological implications .",
    "if this metric is compared with grumiller s one , it can be easily seen that the rindler s acceleration constant is derived from the charge @xmath40 . beside this acceleration",
    "we have an additional constant @xmath47 which can be interpreted as a global monopole term @xcite .",
    "the global monopole charge is identified as @xmath48 which gives rise to non - radial stresses .",
    "naturally such a monopole charge modifies the newtonian potential by @xmath49 which violates asymptotic flatness . in case that @xmath50 the line element reduces to the standard schwarzschild - de sitter , as it should be .",
    "the essential parameters of our model consist of @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath4 and @xmath53 ( or @xmath14 ) .",
    "with the choice @xmath27 the uniform electric field @xmath54 will not exist any more . to",
    "what extent our model is physical ? .",
    "satisfaction of the energy conditions are vitally important for a physically acceptable solution .",
    "let us note that in the original grumiller model unless @xmath55 the energy conditions are violated .",
    "in the present case with the ned as source we wish to show that the energy conditions are satisfied .",
    "to illustrate this we explicitly present the corresponding energy momentum tensor as follows@xmath56 = % \\frac{2a}{r}\\text{diag}\\left [ 2+\\frac{k}{ar},2+\\frac{k}{ar},1,1\\right ] .\\]]the weak energy condition ( wec ) requires that @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the strong energy condition ( sec ) ,  in addition to wec , we must have @xmath59 these conditions are both satisfied provided that @xmath60for our choice of @xmath61 , @xmath62 so that @xmath63 and @xmath64 this suggests that validity of the energy conditions confines the motion by @xmath65 and the rindler acceleration @xmath66 the fact that @xmath5 is very small ( @xmath67 ) makes @xmath6 from ( 7 ) still quite large .",
    "@xmath65 can be interpreted as a uniform background electric field filling all space which appears also in the lagrangian ( i.e. @xmath68 ) .",
    "this makes @xmath69 an indispensable parameter of the theory provided we stipulate the energy conditions .",
    "once we set @xmath70 the nonlinear lagrangian reduces to @xmath71 with the solution for the electric field @xmath72 ( @xmath73 )",
    ". however , this will violate the energy conditions and due to this fact , we are compelled to invoke a space filling uniform electric field @xmath65 as regulator , much like the concept of cosmological constant @xmath74 all galaxies must be considered immersed in such a background @xmath65 to regulate energy conditions .    the role of @xmath65 becomes even more transparent if we assume the central object to host a black hole .",
    "the horizon radius shows a steep rise versus @xmath54 and the hawking temperature @xmath75 which depends also on the rindler acceleration reaches saturation for increasing @xmath65 .",
    "that is , no matter how @xmath65 rises , @xmath75 reaches a constant value above zero . from the thermodynamical point of view , @xmath76 acts as a point of phase transition . from physical standpoints",
    "the global monopole parameter , @xmath77 @xmath78 may be chosen small enough , apt for perturbative treatment .",
    "this is not imperative however , since relaxation of this condition will naturally yield from the geodesics equation open , hyperbolic orbits admissible as well .",
    "global monopoles are known to arise also in modified @xmath79 theories @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion for a charged test particle is given by@xmath80 in which the dot stands for derivative with respect to proper time and the effective potential reads@xmath81 + f(r)\\left ( 1+\\frac{\\ell ^{2}}{r^{2}}\\right ) .\\]]here",
    "@xmath82 (= energy ) and @xmath83 (= angular momentum ) are the constants of motion while @xmath84 is the charge of the test particle .",
    "the simplest way to handle this potential analytically is to consider a neutral ( @xmath85 ) particle at larger @xmath6 with @xmath86 the geodesics equation simplifies to @xmath87 which integrates to @xmath88it is observed that in this model there is not only a maximum radius ( i.e. eq.(7 ) ) but also a maximum proper time determined by @xmath89 and @xmath90    the null geodesics equation for @xmath91 reads @xcite , for @xmath92@xmath93which upon scalings @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 the perturbative solution can be found . employing @xmath97 as the flat space solution with @xmath98 the minimum light distance , the total bending angle for the photon orbit @xcite modifies into@xmath99\\ ] ]      in order to establish a pure magnetic solution of ned we choose our lagrangian as @xmath100where @xmath25 is the coupling constant and @xmath101 note that these constants are distinct from the ones given in ( 2 ) .",
    "the vector potential is @xmath102 with @xmath103magnetic constant so that @xmath104 solution of the einstein - ned equations with the same sss metric ansatz ( 3 ) will lead to the metric function ( with @xmath105)@xmath106 in which @xmath107 and @xmath108 are constants .",
    "it can be checked that the wec and sec are satisfied provided @xmath109 naturally , in this model the galaxies ca nt run out infinity .",
    "the newtonian potential in this model modifies as @xmath110so that the attractive force @xmath111 takes the form @xmath112for circular orbits since @xmath113 for a unit mass particle , this yields the velocity function for a unit test mass , as @xmath114this differs from the newtonian model ( @xmath115 ) and the new model proposed by grumiller ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "evidently , for @xmath117 our model has the advantage since @xmath118 which is the case believed to be in the presence of dark matter .",
    "1 displays the three cases openly with the chosen mass and density functions as described below shortly .",
    "no doubt the gap between our model and newtonian one corresponds to the invisible dark matter .",
    "let s consider a model for the mass distribution of a galaxy given by@xmath119 in which @xmath120 @xmath121 and @xmath122 are real positive constants . the fig .",
    "1 is a plot of rotational velocity @xmath123 for three different models .",
    "as a side remark , the problem can be considered from the newtonian viewpoint . from the newtonian potential ( 15 ) the centripetal force for an object in circular orbit of radius @xmath6 is given by@xmath124or equivalently@xmath125 in which @xmath126 the normal mass and @xmath127 the dark mass .",
    "we assume a normal matter density @xmath128 and a dark matter density @xmath129 , such that @xmath130one easily finds @xmath131 while @xmath128 is given by ( 18 ) .",
    "now , our aim is to see how the parameters should be adjusted in order to find @xmath132 , i.e. the experimentally recorded ratio .",
    "the parameter @xmath133 is defined by @xmath134 in which it is assumed that beyond @xmath16 both matter and dark matter become insignificant .",
    "the latter equation yields@xmath135 in the zeroth order approximation , one considers a solid central object with a certain boundary at @xmath136 and a uniform mass distribution @xmath137 which implies ( @xmath138)@xmath139herein @xmath140 and @xmath108 and upon substitution it yields@xmath141which gives the relation between the radius of the central object @xmath142 the magnetic charge @xmath143 and coupling constant @xmath144 the normal matter @xmath145 will be expressed in terms of charge @xmath146 and ratio @xmath147(@xmath148 ) by .",
    "in conclusion , the idea of nonlinear electrodynamics ( ned ) popularized in 1930 s by born and infeld @xcite to resolve singularities remains still attractive and find rooms of applications even in modern cosmology .",
    "specifically , a pure electrical ned model serves to generate rindler acceleration which was considered responsible for the effects of large distance gravity . another ( i.e. pure magnetic ) ned model modifies the rindler acceleration term from @xmath150 to @xmath151 which gives near horizontal velocity curves to conform observations .",
    "as shown ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , our curve lies in between grumiller and newton models . for this reason without resorting to yet unknown particles dark matter may emerge as a manifestation of ned .",
    "the models of ned we employ here have no counterpart in linear , more familiar maxwell theory .",
    "our models are derived in particular to satisfy the energy ( weak and strong ) conditions . as a pay - off in the pure electric case , for instance a global monopole field crops up .",
    "this may be considered as a background , space - filling uniform electric field to act as the background energy level .",
    "unfortunately once this field is deleted our energy conditions will be violated .",
    "finally , it will not be wrong to state that ned , which has rarely been appealing may encompass larger scopes in physics / cosmology than envisioned ."
