    "an accurate determination of the ages and distances of globular clusters ( gcs ) is an important constraint for the age of the universe , and for the theory of galaxy formation . in particular",
    "it is important to compute very accurate relative ages to understand if there is a spread in ages among the galactic gcs or not .",
    "the use of the stellar luminosity function ( lf ) to compute ages of gcs was first proposed by paczynski ( 1984 ) .",
    "later on , jimenez & padoan ( 1996 ) and padoan & jimenez ( 1996 ) developed a method to determine _ the age and the distance of a gc simultaneously _ , using the lf .",
    "the method is described in detail in padoan & jimenez ( 1996 ) , where it is concluded , on the basis of artificial data , that an uncertainty of about 0.6 gyr in the age and 0.06 mag in the distance modulus can be achieved , if the number of stars , in 1 mag - wide luminosity bins , is known with an uncertainty of 3% .    in this paper",
    "we use recent observations of the galactic globular clusters m5 ( sandquist et al .",
    "1996 ) and m55 ( desidera & ortolani , private communication ) to apply the lf method and compute accurate ages and distance module .",
    "these two clusters are very adequate since m55 is a metal - poor one and m5 has intermediate metallicity , so we can investigate the spread in ages ( if any ) in the formation of the gc system .    in this letter",
    "we apply for the first time the lf method to real data and we show that the method is much more superior to traditional methods ( isochrone fitting to the main sequence turn off point , @xmath4 method , or any other methods that involve the fitting of the main sequence turn off ) .",
    "the method is superior because it allows to determine the age and the distance simultaneously and independently and because the errors in computing the age and distance are straightforward to calculate .",
    "furthermore , it gives age determinations with sufficient accuracy to make cosmological predictions .",
    "this first application of our lf method to real data shows that our previous theoretical predictions were correct .",
    "in order to apply our lf method it is necessary to obtain the complete lf of the globular cluster from almost the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , down to the upper main sequence .",
    "the number of observed stars should be very large , in order to keep statistical errors sufficiently low .",
    "recently , two lfs that fulfill these requirements have been obtained by sandquist et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for m5 , and by desidera & ortolani ( private communication ) for m55 .",
    "m5 is a massive globular cluster , with an average metallicity of @xmath5=-1.17\\pm0.01 $ ] , according to sneden et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , and @xmath5=-1.4 $ ] , according to zinn & west ( 1984 ) .",
    "since it is a high altitude cluster ( @xmath6 ) , it is not seriously affected by contamination and interstellar reddening . for the metallicity of this cluster we used @xmath5=-1.3 $ ] , and adopt @xmath7 .",
    "the completeness of the lf is discussed in detail in sandquist et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "m55 is among the poor - metal clusters .",
    "the main advantage of m55 is that it is not very concentrated and therefore it is possible to resolve its core into stars .",
    "again due to its high galactic latitude ( @xmath8 ) , interstellar reddening and contamination are negligible .",
    "we adopt a metallicity of @xmath5=-1.9 $ ] ( briley et al .",
    "1993 ) and @xmath7 .",
    "the lf was provided to us by desidera & ortolani ( private communication . ) , who have performed extensive tests with artificial stars , in order to compute the completeness of the sample .    in this letter",
    "we use the data in the filter band @xmath9 for m55 and in @xmath10 for m5 .",
    "this allows us to illustrate the robustness of the method in two very different bands .",
    "the other colours were used in both cases to remove the horizontal and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars . in the case of the horizontal branch",
    "it is quite easy to distinguish them from the rgb .",
    "even if this is not the case for the agb stars , the number of stars used in the lf method is so large in that bin that a small mistake in distinguishing rgb and agb stars does not contribute significantly to the errors in the final age and distance determination .    in producing lfs to study both gcs",
    "we have used @xmath11=0.4 $ ] and compute this effect in our solar - scaled tracks using the approach by chieffi , straniero & salaris ( 1991 ) .",
    "this value of alpha enhancement is well justified by spectroscopic observations of giants in gcs ( minniti et al 1996 ) , and this enhancement is valid for a metallicity range ( @xmath5=-1.5 $ ] to @xmath12 ) .",
    "to determine the age and the distance of a gc , two independent constraints are needed from the lf , that is to say the number of stars in two different bins .",
    "one more bin is needed for the normalization , and a fourth bin is useful to estimate the completeness of the data , but it is not used in this work , since the completeness was previously estimated performing experiments with artificial stars ( nevertheless , we have checked that the fourth bin gives the same completeness estimation as the artificial star tests ) .",
    "we use a bin positioned at the rgb to normalize the lf , and two bins around the sub - giant region to constrain age and distance modulus . as discussed in padoan & jimenez ( 1996 ) ,",
    "the precise position of the two bins at the sub - giant region is extremely important .",
    "in fact , our lf method is based on the careful optimization of those two bins .",
    "the result of the optimization process is a contour plot of the quantity @xmath13 , on the plane @xmath14 , where :    @xmath15 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\ + [ n_{3,\\rm th}(t)-n_{3,\\rm obs}(t , m - m)]^2    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 is the age , @xmath17 the distance modulus , @xmath18 the normalized ratio @xmath19 , @xmath20 the number of stars in the @xmath21th observational bin and @xmath22 the corresponding theoretical ratio .",
    "the values of @xmath22 are only functions of the age of the gc , since the shape of the theoretical lf depends only on the age ( for a given chemical composition ) , while the values of @xmath18 are also functions of the distance modulus , because the observational lf depends on the distance modulus , if the bins are defined in absolute magnitudes .",
    "if the set of bins is not optimal , the contour plot of @xmath23 shows only open lines , which define a relation between age and distance modulus .",
    "once the set of bins is optimized , the contour plot shows also closed lines , that define both the age and the distance modulus of the gc at the same time .",
    "if the lines start to become closed only for @xmath24 , the degeneracy age - distance modulus is broken only if stellar counts are available with uncertainty smaller than 10% .",
    "this is the reason why the method requires lf with a large number of stars and excellent photometry .",
    "the optimization process , applied to m55 and m5 gave the following set of bins :    @xmath25 mag \\nonumber \\\\ m_{i , optimal , m5}=(t_{gyr}-8.0)\\times0.05   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "+ [ 2.87,2.07,1.27,-3.13 ] mag \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the optimal bins shift by @xmath26 mag / gyr , as determined in our previous work ( padoan & jimenez 1996 ) .",
    "this is an essential point in the attempt to obtain the contour plot of @xmath23 .",
    "note that for m5 we could use two bins narrower than 1.0 mag , in order to improve the sensitivity of the method , thanks to the very large number of stars in the bins and to the good quality of the photometry .    our results for m55 is shown in fig .  1 ,",
    "and for m5 in fig .  2 .",
    "in both cases , closed contour lines are obtained for @xmath27 , and the uncertainty in age and @xmath17 , obtained at any given level of @xmath23 , is comparable for the two clusters , and similar to what we previously predicted with artificial lfs ( padoan & jimenez , 1996 )    given the photometric uncertainty and the statistical uncertainty in the stellar counts ( @xmath28 , where n is the number of stars ) , we estimate a global uncertainty of 6% for the case of m55 , and of 4% for the case of m5 . entering fig .  1 and fig .  2 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively ,",
    "one gets the results listed in table  1 .",
    "the results listed in table  1 show that the age and the distance modulus of m55 are in good agreement with previous determinations by mandushev et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and alcaino et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .",
    ".the table gives the values for the age and distance modulus for m5 and m55 .",
    "these values have been determined _ simultaneously _ using the luminosity function method described in the text . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the case of m5 the results agree with sanquist et al . conclusions .",
    "they estimate in fact an age of @xmath31 gyr , for @xmath5=-1.17 $ ] , and they state that the age would be 11.5 gyr , for @xmath5=-1.4 $ ] .",
    "we use @xmath5=-1.3 $ ] , and get an age of @xmath32 gyr .",
    "they also estimate @xmath33 mag for @xmath5=-1.17 $ ] , and @xmath34 mag , for @xmath5=-1.4 $ ] , using the sub - dwarf fitting of the main sequence .",
    "we get @xmath35 mag , for @xmath5=-1.3 $ ] .",
    "note that in padoan & jimenez ( 1996 ) we estimated a variation of 0.02 mag in @xmath17 , for a shift of 0.1 in metallicity ; so we would predict @xmath36 mag , for @xmath5=-1.4 $ ] .",
    "= 1.0    the distance modulus measured with the lf method is therefore in excellent agreement with the distance modulus determined with the sub - dwarf fitting .",
    "the uncertainty of our estimates is very small ( @xmath37 mag ) , and no assumption on the age is required .",
    "the lf method is superior to the main sequence turn - off ( msto ) method ( chaboyer , demarque & sarajedini 1996 ) , to determine the absolute age of globular clusters , because it is not affected by the three largest sources of theoretical uncertainty affecting the msto method , that is to say the determination of the value of the mixing length parameter , the morphology of the msto and the color-@xmath38 calibration ( see jimenez et al .",
    "1996 for a detailed discussion of the main uncertainties in the msto method ) .",
    "furthermore , the msto method needs to know the distance in order to determine the age , and it is unable to break this degeneracy .",
    "the absolute ages , determined in this work for m55 and m5 , seem to indicate that the oldest gcs are not older than 14 gyr .",
    "the lf method is a very powerful tool to investigate relative ages , since most uncertainties of stellar evolution theories are in that case avoided . from the comparison of the ages of m5 and m55",
    "we can conclude that the age of the two gcs is not significantly different .",
    "we conclude by remarking that most methods to determine age and distance module of gcs share two common problems : some degree of dependence of age on distance modulus ( or vice - versa ) , and a somewhat fuzzy procedure to estimate the uncertainty of the final result .",
    "our lf method , instead , gives constraints for both age and distance modulus independently , and estimates both most probable values and uncertainties in a straightforward way .",
    "= 1.0    on the basis of the present work , we think that very high quality data for gcs , together with the lf method , may shed new light on the problems of the age of the oldest stars in the universe and the formation of the galaxy .",
