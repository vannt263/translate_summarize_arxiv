    "the galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) plays an important role in the propagation of cosmic rays even at highest energies .",
    "expected deflections  of order few degrees or larger  are comparable or exceed the angular resolution of the existing cosmic ray experiments",
    ". such deflections may therefore be observable .",
    "their understanding is crucial when searching for sources of the highest - energy cosmic rays if the latter are charged particles .",
    "the detailed study of deflections of ultra - high energy proton primaries in the gmf is particularly important if the deflections in _ extra - galactic _ magnetic fields are small . according to the results of refs .",
    "@xcite this is likely to be the case ( see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the galactic magnetic field has been shown to have both regular and turbulent components .",
    "the regular component is thought to have a spiral structure reminiscent of the galactic arms with one or more reversals toward inner ( and probably also outer ) galaxy and the magnitude of order @xmath1 g in the vicinity of the earth @xcite .",
    "the corresponding global model of gmf was constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite and is often used in the discussion of propagation of cosmic ray primaries in the galaxy . according to this model , protons with energy @xmath2  ev can be deflected in the regular gmf by @xmath3 .",
    "there are indications that such a coherent deflections may indeed be present  @xcite in the cosmic ray data .",
    "the random component of gmf causes the spread of arrival directions of uhecr around the mean position , thus diluting ( and potentially destroying ) important information about the actual location of the source @xcite . under certain conditions on the magnetic field",
    "it may also lead to the `` lensing '' of cosmic rays @xcite provided the number of sources contributing to the observed uhecr flux is small , as is favored by the statistics of clustering @xcite .",
    "thus , the influence of a random fields is not simply destructive , but may give useful information on the cosmic rays and gmf itself .",
    "observationally , the magnitude of the random component of gmf is comparable to the magnitude of the regular one .",
    "however , the deflections of cosmic ray primaries in the random field are expected to be considerably smaller .",
    "indeed , if the correlation length @xmath4 of the random component is much smaller than the propagation distance @xmath5 , the deflections caused by the random field are proportional to @xmath6 , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , while the deflections in the regular field are proportional to the distance @xmath5 itself .",
    "usually the deflections in the random field are estimated as ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the energy of cr primary and @xmath9 is the rms value of the random magnetic field strength .",
    "however , the global picture of gmf is very complicated .",
    "the magnetic field may be structured on relatively large scales , including possibility of magnetic bubbles , sheets , filaments , magnetic `` winds '' etc .",
    ", so one can not rely on ( and be restricted to ) a generic estimate uniformly over the whole sky .",
    "the rms deflections of cosmic ray primaries in the random field are determined unambiguously by the magnetic field power spectrum .",
    "the latter can be extracted from observations , see e.g. ref .",
    "several existing measurements of the gmf power spectrum indicate that the correlation length can be large in some directions on the sky . in this case",
    "the deflections are no longer proportional to @xmath6 , and the estimate ( [ fstestimeate ] ) does not apply .    the purpose of the present paper is to estimate the deflections of uhecr primaries in the turbulent component of the galactic magnetic field taking into account possible dependence of gmf parameters on the region of the sky and the possibility of large corelation length .",
    "we express the uhecr deflections directly through the observable parameters characterizing the power spectrum of the magnetic field .",
    "to this end we derive the relation between the mean square deflection and the power spectrum ( pws ) of the gmf fluctuations .",
    "the result is most conveniently represented through the factor @xmath10 defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are deflections in the random and uniform components of gmf , respectively , and @xmath14 is a projection of a uniform field onto the direction orthogonal to the line of sight .",
    "the factor @xmath10 varies between 0 and 1 and is expressed in terms of the power spectrum of the random field by eq .",
    "( [ theta2-fin ] ) .",
    "moreover , we show that it is a function of a single observable parameter @xmath15 , the angular scale of the break in the relevant structure function of gmf . in the case of small correlation length when the estimate ( [ fstestimeate ] ) applies , one has @xmath16 .",
    "the values of @xmath10 in our galaxy derived from the existing observational data vary in the range @xmath17 .",
    "this implies typical deflections of a @xmath2  ev proton in the random field of order @xmath18 depending on the direction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sect : cor.length.and.ps ] we recall the relations between the power spectrum and the correlation length and introduce the notations . in sec .",

    "[ conclusions ] summarizes our results .",
    "to introduce notations and specify our assumptions , let us first consider the statistical properties of a random magnetic field @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",
    "we define the fourier components of the magnetic field according to @xmath21 here @xmath22 refers to the fluctuating component of the total magnetic field ; the regular part of gmf has to be treated separately . in what follows",
    "we assume that the fluctuations obey gaussian statistics and are spatially homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "the last two assumptions deserve a comment .",
    "the statistical characteristics of the magnetic field are different in different sky patches .",
    "our analysis and results should be applied to each of these patches separately .",
    "we assume that statistical properties of gmf are ( approximately ) constant over a single patch .",
    "also , within one patch the magnetic field fluctuations may not be isotropic , with the preferred direction being set by the regular component of gmf .",
    "the present data are not sufficient to establish or rule out the isotropy of gmf fluctuations . with the more precise data this assumption",
    "may need to be reconsidered , and the analysis may need to be refined .    with the above assumptions , all correlators of the magnetic field",
    "can be expressed in terms of the two - point correlation function which can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a unit vector in the direction of @xmath25 and the projection tensor ensures the divergence - free nature of the magnetic field , @xmath26 .",
    "the dimensional normalization factors are chosen in such a way that the power spectrum @xmath27 has physical units of @xmath28 , i.e. in our case it is measured in the units of ( gauss)@xmath29 . the correlation function of the magnetic field fluctuations is defined as @xmath30 it determines the rms value of the field amplitude @xmath9 , @xmath31 and the correlation length @xmath4 , @xmath32 the energy density contained in a random component of the magnetic field is related to the field variance as @xmath33 .    as will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ obs : pws ] , in a certain range of momenta the existing observations support a power - law behavior of power spectra of the magnetic field fluctuations , @xmath34 since the energy density in the magnetic field is finite , there has to be a break in the pure power - law behavior , which can be parametrized as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a normalization constant and @xmath37 is the momentum scale at which the break in the spectrum occurs .",
    "( note that abrupt ultraviolet and infrared cut - off can be modeled as @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively . ) in what follows we assume this form of gmf power spectrum .",
    "the variance @xmath9 , and consequently the energy density , converges if @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "summing up contributions from both parts of the spectrum one finds @xmath42 finiteness of the correlation length requires stronger constraint , @xmath43 .",
    "one then has @xmath44 if @xmath45 , the correlation length diverges at small momenta and is dominated by the largest possible distance scale in the problem .",
    "deflections of cosmic rays are most significant in this case .      a toy model leading to the pws with the break is illustrated in fig .",

    "the turbulent magnetic field is contained within the bubble - like structures .",
    "denote by @xmath46 the typical size of the largest energy - containing eddies , which is also called an outer scale of turbulence or energy injection scale .",
    "it is often assumed that @xmath46 corresponds to a typical size of the supernova remnants , and that inside eddies the pws corresponds to mhd or kolmogorov turbulence . with the assumption that fluctuations in different `` bubbles '' are uncorrelated , the corresponding correlation function can be approximated as @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ correlationlength ] ) we see that the correlation length of the magnetic field fluctuations is related to the scale @xmath46 as @xmath49 .",

    "the 3d correlation function is zero at large separations . in general , however , the fluctuations may be present on large scales as well .",
    "this is the case , e.g. , when the kolmogorov turbulence is contained not within the `` bubbles '' as above , but within long sheets or filaments .",
    "when substantial power is present in fluctuations up to the largest scales , the correlation length may diverge .",
    "three - dimensional power spectrum of the magnetic field fluctuations , @xmath27 , and the corresponding 3d correlation function are not measured directly .",
    "instead , one measures the parameters of the two - dimensional angular correlation function @xmath52 of some physical observable which can be , e.g. , the intensity of the polarized synchrotron radiation or faraday rotation measure along different directions , see sect .",
    "[ observations ] for examples . for such observables the relation between 3d correlation function and the angular correlation function involves integration along the line of sight as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] . for example",

    "deflections of uhecr in the random component of the galactic magnetic field are usually discussed in the limit when the correlation length @xmath4 is much smaller than the propagation distance @xmath5 . however , even in this limit both the correlation length and the propagation distance in gmf ( and therefore typical deflections ) vary with direction .",
    "moreover , the existing gmf data suggest that the assumption of small correlation length may not be valid uniformly all over the sky .",
    "we have calculated deflections in a more general approach which does not require correlation length to be small and relies directly on the spectrum of gmf fluctuations measured in a relatively small patch of the sky .",
    "our method therefore automatically takes into account variations of the gmf characteristics with direction .",
    "we have shown that the ratio of the deflections in the random and uniform components of gmf , eq .",
    "( [ thr_thu_def ] ) , is expressed in terms of the factor @xmath10 which depends on the spectrum of the magnetic field fluctuations as given by eq .",
    "( [ theta2-fin ] ) . for the power - law spectrum with a single break",
    "the factor @xmath10 can be written as a function of one directly observable parameter @xmath15 , the angular scale of the break in the relevant structure function . in the case of a small correlation length",
    "one finds @xmath16 .    using the measurements of the gmf power spectrum in the sky regions where it is available , we have shown that the deflections in the random component are small , @xmath0 of the deflections in the uniform field , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ra ] .",
    "this is sufficiently small not to preclude identification of sources of uhecr using methods of refs .",
    "for instance , the deflection of a proton with energy @xmath189 ev due to the random component of gmf is expected to be about @xmath18 depending on the direction .",
    "this is below the resolution of the agasa experiment , but can be above the resolution of the hires detector in the stereo mode and the expected resolution of the pierre auger experiment .",
    "thus , the detailed study of the random component of gmf is particularly important for the interpretation of data which will be collected by the new generation of uhecr experiments . to this end ,",
    "the all - sky map of the essential parameters determining the power spectra of gmf is highly desirable .",
    "these maps may be obtained from the measurements of faraday rotation and maps of diffuse polarized synchrotron galactic emission .",
    "we are grateful to s. dubovsky , d. grasso , m. haverkorn and v. rubakov for useful comments .",
    "the work of p.t . is supported in part by the swiss science foundation , grant 20 - 67958.02 and by iisn , belgian science policy ( under contract iap v/27 ) .",
    "in this section we derive eqs .",
    "( [ kandc1])([qs_t ] ) . these equations are valid for a large class of observables including faraday rotation measures . to simplify the presentation",
    "we derive them in the case when the correlation function is given by equation ( [ variance ] ) .    the relation between 3d correlation function and angular correlation function involves the integration along the line of sight , @xmath190 where @xmath191 is the angle between the vectors @xmath192 and @xmath193 and @xmath194 takes the values @xmath195 and @xmath196 in the case of point sources and diffuse radiation , respectively .",
    "we concentrate in what follows on the case @xmath197 relevant for all points in fig .",
    "[ fig : ra ] except @xmath198 and @xmath5 .    introducing the variables @xmath199 and @xmath200 and taking the limit of small angles one can write eq .",

    "according to definition ( [ sf ] ) , this relation gives for the structure function @xmath60 : @xmath207 .",
    "\\label{sf1}\\ ] ] let us assume that @xmath208 is a broken power law , eq .",
    "( [ bpws ] ) . then the structure function is also a broken power law behaving as @xmath209 and @xmath210 below and above the angular scale @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the exponents @xmath211 are related to exponents @xmath212 in eq .",
    "( [ bpws ] ) as follows , @xmath213 the break occurs at @xmath214    the angular power spectrum , @xmath55 , and the angular correlation function at small angles are related by the hankel transform , eq .",
    "( [ cl1 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath208 is given by the power law ( [ bpws ] ) with @xmath215 ( i.e. , the correlation length converges ) , the integral in eq .",
    "( [ volume2angle3 ] ) is saturated in the region @xmath216 . in this region @xmath217 ; therefore , the last two terms in eq .",
    "( [ volume2angle3 ] ) can be neglected .",
    "( this holds whenever the correlation length is much smaller @xmath5 and the integration over @xmath202 in eq .",
    "( [ volume2angle2 ] ) can be extended to infinity . )",
    "comparison of eqs .",

    "( [ cl2 ] ) is generalized trivially to the case of non - zero @xmath194 by replacing @xmath219 by @xmath220 . for a broken power - law behavior of @xmath208 ,",
