    "often , these events are rare , so automated high throughput imaging is needed in order to provide statistically and biologically meaningful analysis  @xcite .",

    "existing high throughput imaging techniques  @xcite can not meet the space - bandwidth-_time _ product ( sbp - t ) required for widefield _ in vitro _ applications . here",
    ", we introduce a new computational microscopy technique with both high spatial and temporal resolution over a wide fov .",
    "our method is an extension of fourier ptychographic microscopy ( fpm )  @xcite , which overcomes the physical space - bandwidth product ( sbp ) limit . instead of choosing between large fov _ or _ high resolution , fpm achieves both by trading acquisition speed .",

    "though the spatial resolution of each measurement is low , the images collected with high illumination angles ( dark field ) contain sub - resolution information .",
    "the reconstructed image achieves resolution beyond the diffraction limit of the objective - the sum of the objective and illumination nas .",
    "distinct from synthetic aperture , fpm does not measure phase directly at each angle , but instead uses nonlinear optimization algorithms  @xcite similar to translational diversity  @xcite and ptychography  @xcite .",
    "conveniently , the led array coded source used here is implemented as a simple and inexpensive hardware modification to an existing microscope .",

    "[ setup],scaledwidth=75.0% ]    the standard approach for large sbp microscopy is slide scanning , in which the sample is mechanically moved around while imaging with a high resolution objective to build up a large fov .",
    "scanning limits throughput  @xcite and is unsuitable for _ in vitro _ imaging of dynamic events . instead of starting with high resolution and stitching together a large fov ,",
    "fpm starts with a large fov and stitches together images to recover high resolution .",
    "a major advantage is its ability to capture the required set of images with no moving parts , by varying illumination angles . in addition , scanners use high magnification objectives with short depth of field ( dof ) , thus requiring extensive auto - focusing mechanisms . in contrast , fpm provides robustness to focus errors because its dof is longer than that which would be provided by a high - magnification objective of equivalent na  @xcite .",
    "further , out of focus images can be digitally refocused  @xcite .    the main limitation of fpm for real - time _ in vitro _",
    "applications is long acquisition times and large datasets .",
    "not only are a large number of images ( @xmath1200 ) captured for each reconstruction , but also long exposure times are needed for the dark field images . to shorten exposure times ,",
    "we first built a custom hardware setup consisting of high - brightness leds and fast control circuitry ( see methods  [ method - setup ] ) .",
    "this allows us to reduce total acquisition time by @xmath2 , enabling a full 173 led scan to capture 0.96 gigapixels of data in under 7 seconds . while this speed is already suitable for many _ in vitro _",
    "applications ( _ e.g. _ cell division processes ) , fast subcellular dynamics ( _ e.g. _ vesicle tracking ) require sub - second capture to avoid severe motion blur .",
    "since the camera s data transfer rate is the limiting factor , large sbp images can not be captured in less than 1 second unless we can reduce the data requirements .",
    "furthermore , for studies requiring time - series measurements , the large data requirement ( @xmath11 gigapixel per dataset ) poses severe burdens on both storage and processing .    in order to reconstruct large sbp from fewer images ,",
    "we need to fundamentally change our capture strategy .",
    "to do this , we eliminate redundancy in the data by designing new source coding schemes . the redundancy arises because of a @xmath3 overlap requirement in fourier space for neighboring leds  @xcite .",
    "this means that we must capture @xmath110@xmath0 more data than we reconstruct if using ` sequential ' fpm .",
    "our angle - multiplexing scheme instead turns on multiple leds simultaneously for each measurement , allowing better coverage of fourier space with each image . without eliminating the overlap",
    ", we therefore fill in fourier space faster .",
    "previous work employed a random coding strategy across both brightfield and dark field regions  @xcite .",
    "one problem with this scheme is that the brightfield images and dark field images have large differences in intensity ( @xmath110 - 100@xmath0 ) .",
    "considering poisson noise statistics , this means that images with mixed brightfield and dark field components may suffer from the dark field signal being overwhelmed by the brightfield noise . as a result",
    ", we significantly improve our multiplexing results here by separating brightfield from dark field leds .",
    "furthermore , we note that asymmetric illumination - based differential phase contrast ( dpc )  @xcite provides a means for recovering quantitative phase and intensity images out to 2@xmath0 the objective na with only 4 images .",
    "hence , there is no need to individually scan the brightfield leds .",
    "our new method , termed source - coded fpm , uses a hybrid illumination scheme : it first captures 4 dpc images ( top , bottom , left , right half - circles ) to cover the brightfield leds , then uses random multiplexing with 8 leds to fill in the dark field fourier space region ( fig .",
    "[ setup]b ) .",
    "source - coded fpm approaches the theoretical limit for  @xcite , set by the camera s data transfer rate .",
    "we achieve of 46  megapixels / second , calculated according to  @xcite ( 4@xmath0 fov and 0.8 na captured in 0.8 seconds ) .",
    "though the data rate of our camera is larger ( 138 megapixels / second ) , we leave some redundancy in order to ensure robust algorithm convergence .",
    "reconstruction algorithms that explicitly take _ a priori _ information into account , such as sparsity based methods  @xcite , could further improve capture speed ; here , for generality , we choose not to make any assumptions on the sample .",
    "both sequential fpm and source - coded fpm require the number of images in the dataset to grow quadratically with improved final resolution .",
    "this is due to the coverage area in fourier space increasing in proportion to the square of the final na .",
    "however , our source - coded method has a slower growth rate ( fig .",
    "[ setup]c ) and stays flat for less than 2@xmath0 resolution improvement .",
    "conveniently , these techniques can flexibly trade off fov , resolution and acquisition time by choosing the illumination angle range .",
    "for _ in vitro _",
    "applications , stain - free and label - free is particularly attractive because it is non - invasive and non - toxic .",
    "fpm provides both intensity and phase  @xcite , which contain morphological and cell mass  @xcite information that can be used for quantitative study  @xcite . in order to achieve accurate , high - quality results for unstained samples , we needed to make several modifications to the fpm algorithm .",
    "it is well known that non - convex problems such as phase retrieval will often get stuck in local minima  @xcite ; the best way to avoid this is to provide a good initial guess  @xcite .",
    "previous work in fpm uses a low - resolution intensity image as the initial guess  @xcite .",
    "stained samples with strong intensity variations thus reconstruct successfully , since the intensity - only initialization is close to the actual solution .",
    "however , unstained samples are phase objects and so the intensity - only initial guess does not provide a good starting point .",
    "furthermore , fpm does not measure phase directly at each angle , and the phase contrast provided by the asymmetric illumination results in uneven sensitivity to phase at different spatial frequencies .",
    "a detailed phase transfer function analysis  @xcite based on the weak - object ( born ) approximation  @xcite shows that low - frequency phase information is poorly captured , since it results only from illumination angles that are close to the objective na .",
    "thus , low spatial frequency phase information is more difficult to reconstruct than high spatial frequency phase information , contrary to the situation for intensity reconstructions . to improve our reconstruction",
    ", we use a linearly approximated phase solution based on dpc deconvolution  @xcite as a close initial guess for spatial frequencies within the 2 na bandwidth .",
    "we then run a nonlinear optimization algorithm to solve the full phase problem ( see methods  [ method - algorithm ] ) , resulting in high - quality phase reconstructions with high resolution ( fig .",
    "[ compare]a ) and good low spatial frequency phase recovery ( fig .",
    "[ compare]b ) .",
    "we demonstrate our new source - coded fpm by reconstructing large sbp videos of popular cell types _ in vitro _ on a petri dish , for both growing and confluent samples .",
    "we observe sub - cellular and collective cell dynamics happening on different spatial and temporal scales , allowing us to observe rare events in both space and time , due to the large space - bandwidth-_time _ product and flexible tradeoff of time and sbp .",

    "( c ) to validate our source - coded fpm results , we compare to images captured with a 40@xmath0 objective having high resolution ( 0.65 na ) but small fov ( sample : mcf10a ) , as well as sequential fpm .",
    "( d ) we simulate a phase contrast image and compare to one captured by a high - resolution objective ( 0.65 na , 40@xmath0).[compare],scaledwidth=99.0% ]    a major advantage of quantitative phase imaging is that it can visualize transparent samples in a label - free , non - invasive way .",
    "figure  [ compare]a compares our reconstructions before and after staining , for the same fixed human osteosarcoma epithelial ( u2os ) sample . with staining ,",
    "the intensity image clearly displays detailed subcellular features .",
    "stained samples also display strong phase effects , proportional to the local shape and density of the sample . without staining ,",
    "the intensity image contains very little contrast and is nearly invisible ; however , the phase result clearly captures the sub - cellular features . due to the strong similarity between stained intensity and unstained phase",
    ", it follows that quantitative phase may provide a valid alternative to staining .    to demonstrate the importance of using a good initial guess to initialize the phase recovery for unstained samples , we compare the fpm results both with and without our dpc initialization scheme ( fig .",
    "[ compare]b ) .",
    "both achieve the same 0.7 na resolution , with high spatial frequency features ( e.g. nucleus and filopodia ) being clearly reconstructed , as expected .",

    "are correctly recovered .",
    "next , we verify the accuracy of the recovered phase values by comparing to images captured directly with a higher resolution objective ( 40@xmath0 0.65 na ) .",

    "[ compare]d , we compare an actual phc image to that simulated from our method s reconstructed result ( see methods  [ method - phc ] ) .",
    "since the phc objective uses annular illumination ( ph2 , 0.25  na ) to achieve resolution corresponding to 0.9 na , it should have slightly better resolution than our reconstruction .",

    "[ fig : hela ] ]    figure  [ fig : hela ] shows a few frames from a time - lapse video of human cervical adenocarcinoma epithelial ( hela ) cell division process over the course of 4 hours , as well as an automated quantitative analysis of cell dry mass evolution .",

    ", one cell is undergoing mitosis and dividing into 4 cells , during which the cells detach from the surface and become more globular ( see video 1 ) .",
    "this situation , if imaged with a high magnification objective , would result in the detached cells moving out of the focal plane and blurring .",
    "however , fpm provides a longer dof than a high magnification objective with equivalent na , so the entire sample stays in focus across the fov .",
    "subcellular features are visible and the dynamics of actin filament formation can be tracked over time .",
    "we show only phase results ( omitting intensity ) , since samples are unstained and have little intensity contrast .",
    "since our reconstructed video contains @xmath120 gigapixels of quantitative phase data with @xmath13,000 cells in each frame , the practical extraction of relevant information requires automated analysis .",
    "it is well known that phc / dic images can not be automatically segmented ( due to the lack of low spatial frequency information ) ; however , our quantitative phase results do not have this problem . using an automated cell segmentation software ( cellprofiler  @xcite ) applied directly to the full fov phase result , we first segment each frame of the video to find each of the @xmath13,400 cells ( fig .",

    "[ nsc]b , in a petri dish .",
    "we use source - coded fpm to achieve the same sbp as in sequential fpm ( 0.8 na resolution across a 4@xmath0 fov ) , but with only 21 images ( sample raw images shown in fig .",

    "this alleviates motion artifacts that would otherwise blur the result due to sub - cellular dynamics that happen on timescales shorter than 7 seconds .",
    "since our source - coded fpm reduces the number of images needed , we can also capture longer video sequences without incurring data management issues .",
    "hence , we create videos of both fast - scale dynamics and slow - scale evolution of nscs with details both on the sub - cellular level and across the entire cell population . for example , while vesicle transport and other organelle motions tend to occur on a short time scale and at a small length scale ( see video 2 ) , nsc differentiation into neuronal and glial lineages occurs on a longer time scale ( _ i.e. _ days ) and at a larger length scale . in the middle time scale , we observe nscs sensing their micro - environment by retracting and extending processes , reorganizing their cytoskeletons , migrating , and maturing their axonal and dendritic processes .",
    ", scaledwidth=75.0% ]    with live samples imaged _ in vitro _",
    ", dynamics create motion blur artifacts that can destroy the resolution improvements gained by large sbp methods .",
    "thus , the final effective resolution is always coupled with acquisition speed and sample - dependent motion . in general , smaller subcellular features tend to move at faster speed ; hence , we find that capture times on the order of minutes always incur motion blur .",
    "for this reason , faster acquisition is essential for _ in vitro _ applications with typical cell types . to demonstrate this point",
    ", we compare the results of our source - coded fpm , sequential fpm with and without real - time hardware controls , and high magnification dpc .",
    "the dpc method is considered our benchmark , since it achieves faster acquisition speeds , avoiding motion blur , albeit with a small fov . in fig .",
    "[ fig : motion ] , we show zoomed - in phase reconstructions for two cell types with each capture scheme , from slowest to fastest . in each case",
    ", the final result has a nominal na of 0.8 and so each of these results _ should _ have the same resolution .",
    "however , it is clear that the slower capture schemes blur out features , rendering much of the small - scale structure and dynamics invisible .    the mcf10a cells in fig .",
    "[ fig : motion]a , b exhibit the fastest dynamics observed , due to rapid shuttling of small vesicles and fluctuations of cytoskeletal fibers ( e.g. actin filaments , microtubules ) . using sequential fpm with 60 second capture time",
    ", we retain almost no details about the structure of the fibers ( fig .",
    "[ fig : motion]a ) . even with our faster hardware setup , requiring only 7 seconds acquisition time ,",
    "the fibers are still completely blurred out . by switching to our source - coded fpm , we obtain the same sbp as the previous two schemes , but with only 0.8 seconds acquisition time . now , fiber cytoskeletal details become more discernible , though there is still some motion blur , as compared to the dpc result ( video 3 ) . hence",
    ", even our source - coded fpm is missing some information in this case . in fig .",
    "[ fig : motion]b we zoom in on another fast process of vesicle transport , where we find that our method captures more of the dynamics than in the fiber fluctuation case , still with some blurring . in video 3 , we show time - lapse videos over 8 hours to observe cell migration and proliferation with subcellular details , captured using our source - coded fpm . thus , the trade - off in fov and time may be more appropriate , depending on what one aims to observe .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : motion]c , d , example results for two different nscs are shown . in both cases , sequential fpm results in significant motion blur , particularly along thin , extended processes and within intracellular vesicles and organelles .",
    "in contrast , source - coded fpm is able to accurately capture the full details of the sample without motion blur artifacts .",
    "while it is difficult to compare directly because the live cells were moving in between capture schemes , in general we can say that most vesicle transport , retraction and extension of processes and other organelle motion can be clearly visualized using source - coded fpm ( see video 4 ) .",
    "the flexibility of our system in trading off fov , resolution and time means that experiments can be tailored to the sample .",
    "for example , the hela and nsc samples shown here display slower sub - cellular dynamics , so are more suited to high sbp imaging with our current scheme , whereas the mcf10a sample necessitates a trade - off of sbp in order to capture data with sufficient speed .",
    "when dynamics are on timescales faster than 0.8 seconds , one should reduce the number of images captured , either by sacrificing fov ( using a larger na objective ) or by reducing the resolution improvement factor ( using a smaller range of leds ) . in the limit",
    ", one can eliminate all the dark field led images and simply implement dpc for maximum speed of capture .",
    "however , for most biological dynamics that are studied _ in vitro _ ( e.g. differentiation , division , apoptosis ) , we find that sub - second acquisition is sufficient , and so the sbp should be maximized within this constraint .    in summary , we have demonstrated a high - speed , large sbp microscopy technique , providing label - free quantitative phase and intensity information .",

    "<S> we demonstrate a new computational illumination technique that achieves large space - bandwidth-_time _ product , for quantitative phase imaging of unstained live samples _ in vitro_. microscope lenses can have either large field of view ( fov ) or high resolution , not both . </S>",
    "<S> fourier ptychographic microscopy ( fpm ) is a new computational imaging technique that circumvents this limit by fusing information from multiple images taken with different illumination angles . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a gigapixel - scale image having both wide fov and high resolution , i.e. large space - bandwidth product ( sbp ) . </S>",
    "<S> fpm has enormous potential for revolutionizing microscopy and has already found application in digital pathology . </S>",
    "<S> however , it suffers from long acquisition times ( on the order of minutes ) , limiting throughput . </S>",
    "<S> faster capture times would not only improve imaging speed , but also allow studies of live samples , where motion artifacts degrade results . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to fixed ( e.g. pathology ) slides , live samples are continuously evolving at various spatial and temporal scales . here , we present a new source coding scheme , along with real - time hardware control , to achieve 0.8 na resolution across a 4@xmath0 fov with sub - second capture times . </S>",
    "<S> we propose an improved algorithm and new initialization scheme , which allow robust phase reconstruction over long time - lapse experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we present the first fpm results for both growing and confluent _ in vitro _ </S>",
    "<S> cell cultures , capturing videos of subcellular dynamical phenomena in popular cell lines undergoing division and migration . </S>",
    "<S> our method opens up fpm to applications with live samples , for observing rare events in both space and time . </S>"
