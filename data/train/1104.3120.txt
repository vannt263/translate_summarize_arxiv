    "although quantum mechanics is an intrinsically probabilistic theory , its inherent application of probabilistic concepts is quite different from that of a classical theory . in particular , in the framework of the quantum mechanics for composite systems , the density matrix is the analogue to the probability distribution of position and momentum in classical statistical mechanics .",
    "such a statistical description through density matrices is required when one considers either an ensemble of systems , or a composite quantum system defined when its preparation history is uncertain and one does not know if it is a pure quantum state or a statistical mixture .",
    "that should be the case of an ensemble of neutrino flavor eigenstates , for instance , in the cosmological scenario .",
    "the description of measurements performed on a composite quantum system provides an important tool to debug the procedures for computing the averaged energy densities of cosmological neutrino flavor eigenstates .",
    "we shall demonstrate that it should result in the appropriate relation between the cosmological neutrino background energy densities and neutrino mass values .",
    "in fact , since one asserts that the generalized theory of quantum measurement is based on the notions of operations and effects , the correlation between measurable flavor neutrino energies and flavor eigenstates , at least from the formal point of view , deserves some specific attention @xcite .",
    "departing from the standard formulation of composite quantum systems , we present the fundamentals of the physical significance of the density matrix theory in computing flavor probabilities and flavor-_averaged _ energies . to overcome the ambiguities and misunderstandings that arise when flavor-_averaged _",
    "energies are defined , we discuss the idea of flavor-_weighted _ energies mathematically correlated to flavor probabilities .",
    "reporting about the generalized theory of quantum measurements , it is demonstrated that one can depict the _ averaged _ and _ weighted _ energy definitions from the idea of _ selective _ and _ non - selective _ quantum measurements .",
    "it is shown that such _ weighted _ energies based on some relations with statistical weights are more convenient in describing certain properties of composite quantum systems strictly related to flavor quantum numbers .",
    "flavor energy `` measurements '' or `` projections '' are therefore potentially subject to imprecise definitions .",
    "obviously it reflects the dynamics of quantum systems being driven by a diagonal hamiltonian in the mass eigenstate basis . in this case , the interpretation of the von - neuman entropy for _ selective _ and _ non - selective _ quantum measurements is helpful in verifying correlations with flavor oscillation probabilities .",

    "the experimental procedure for determining the mass of the neutrino using the cmb results is by inferring the transfer function in the matter power spectrum at small scales @xcite .",
    "the contribution due to massive neutrinos to the closure fraction of cold dark matter at present substantially modifies the matter power spectrum , even for neutrinos behaving like hot dark matter at higher redshifts@xcite .",
    "determining the fraction of the neutrino energy density at late times is therefore a relevant aspect that has to be included in the procedure for deriving neutrino masses . in this manuscript , the influence of different flavor energy definitions in obtaining the predictions for cosmological neutrino mass values are discriminated . in particular , we show how the mass predictions are modified by some explicit dependence on the statistical weights of an ensemble of neutrino flavors .",

    "the concept of flavor-_weighted _ energy is discussed in section iii where it is compared with the previously defined flavor-_averaged _ energy and with the _ total _ averaged energy inherent to composite quantum systems .",
    "the idea of _ selective _ and _ non - selective _ quantum measurements is introduced in manner to embed the definitions of _ averaged _ and _ weighted _ energies . in section iv , an extension of such concepts is proposed in order to include a connection to flavor associated von - neumann entropies .",
    "our results show that there exists a kind of correlation rate between the flavor-_weighted _ energy and the von - neumann entropy changes due to a _ non - selective _ measurement scheme .",
    "finally , potential implications on the properties of the cosmological neutrino background are discussed in section v , where the connection between the _ weighted _ energies and the cosmological neutrino energy density is established .",
    "we draw our conclusions in section vi .",
    "the aspects of neutrino flavor oscillations that are relevant to our analysis can be comprehended from a simplified treatment involving just two degrees of freedom .",

    "( [ eq01c ] ) represents an ambiguous and inappropriate definition of flavor associated to energies , given that it is not uniquely correlated with the respective flavor eigenstate .",

    "such an ambiguity has stimulated some non - standard analysis of the cosmological background neutrinos as a coherent superposition of mass eigenstates , where the ( in)appropriate quantum mechanical treatment affects the neutrino mass values derived from cosmological data @xcite .",

    "thus the arguments that assert the ambiguity and the insufficiency in defining the flavor eigenstate averaged energies through @xmath39 are maintained .",
    "to overcome such incongruities we suggest that some kind of flavor-_weighted _ energy should be considered in order to establish a univoque correspondence between flavor eigenstate energies and the statistical definitions of probabilities , @xmath46 , after simple mathematical manipulations involving the definitions from eq .",

    "now let us report about some basics on quantum statistics and thermodynamics , from which the von - neumann entropy provides an important entropy functional defined in terms of the density matrix by @xmath84 where we have set the multiplicative boltzmann constant , @xmath85 , equal to unity .",

    "( [ eq26a ] ) .",
    "otherwise , the _ selective _ measurement of flavor-_averaged _ energies , which are not expressed in terms of flavor conversion probabilities , does not modify the von - neumann entropy in case of a single - flavor created ensemble . in case of maximal statistical mixtures ,",
    "the entropy change due to a _ non - selective _ measurement is null , i. e. @xmath96 . at the same time , the mixing entropy is maximal and equal to its maximal value , @xmath97 , in case of a @xmath83-level system , and the _ total _ averaged energy is reproduced by the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq07bbb ] ) to @xmath83-flavors .",
    "thus , in case of a maximal statistical mixing , the _ non - selective _ measurement does not change neither the energy nor the entropy of the system while the _ selective _ measurement changes the entropy .    by observing the common points between energies and entropies through the above discussed measurement schemes , i. e. by noticing the following correspondence scheme ,",
    "@xmath98 it is possible to establish the following correlation between entropy changes and the absolute value of time - averaged energy differences , @xmath99 as one can easily depict from figs .",
    "[ an4b ] and [ an5b ] where we have computed time - averaged quantities . in case of flavor oscillating systems , it corresponds to assuming an intrinsic de - coherence mechanism that suppresses the periodic functions of the density matrix non - diagonal elements .",
    "such a de - coherence mechanism is equivalent to a delocalization effect that can be achieved by assuming that momentum @xmath100 states weighted by a momentum distribution @xmath101 are comprised by an ensemble b in the same way that flavor states are comprised by an ensemble a. in this case one should have @xmath102 where @xmath103 denotes an integration over the continuous space of momentum .",

    "it simply corresponds to an indication that when one assumes flavor-_weighted _ energies as the quantifiers for the energy associated to flavor eigenstates , the loss of information due to the measurement procedure is better quantified by the _ non - selective _ related entropy .",
    "to summarize , we shall compute some effective quantities related to flavor-_weighted _ energies in the following section .",
    "the recent issues @xcite on quantum mechanics of cosmological neutrinos has focused on finding an appropriate procedure for computing the neutrino mass values derived from cosmological data . to illustrate an application of our analysis , we reproduce some results from the single - particle quantum mechanics of flavor oscillations reported by fuller and kishimoto @xcite and we show how the density matrix theory supports such results .    from the standard model and cosmological point of views , the main assumption for the cosmological neutrino background",

    "one can also notice that @xmath116 is an effective neutrino temperature obtained by assuming that @xmath117 is a co - moving quantity defined in order to satisfy the boltzmann equation for equilibrium conditions so that @xmath118    in a previous issue @xcite , the energy - momentum dispersion relation was introduced in order to give @xmath119 that leads to the standard choice for the effective mass of a neutrino in flavor eigenstates @xmath111 , @xmath120 it is interpreted as the dynamical mass for ultrarelativistic neutrinos of flavor @xmath111 .",
