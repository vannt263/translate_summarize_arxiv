    "minos is a long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment from the fermilab to soudan mine in minnesota .",
    "it can study the muon neutrino and anti - muon neutrino oscillations over a baseline of @xmath0 with @xmath1 scale .",
    "the recent results of the minos @xmath2 and @xmath3 disappearance experiments show disagreement @xcite .",
    "this can not be explained by the standard oscillation picture since @xmath4 in true vacuum by the cpt invariance , and the matter effect in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 disappearance experiments at the minos are negligible .",
    "it is likely due to the poor statistics especially in the @xmath3 sector ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is still possible that this is a hint of new physics that can affect neutrino oscillations differently from the anti - neutrino oscillation . in this talk",
    ", we go over a possible explanation and briefly discuss its implications for other neutrino experiments .",
    "a detailed discussion can be found in ref .",
    "what type of new physics would be able to explain the minos anomaly ? if we look at the standard model interactions , the @xmath7 boson gives a potential only to the electron neutrinos , and it can affect neutrino oscillations involving the electron neutrino .",
    "but the @xmath8 boson gives a flavor - universal potential to the neutrinos making no effect in neutrino flavor oscillations : @xmath9 with @xmath10 , @xmath11 where @xmath12(@xmath13 ) is the electron(neutron ) number density .",
    "we would like to consider a lepton flavor - dependent long - range interaction ( lri ) .",
    "we assume a lepton flavor - dependent @xmath14 gauge symmetry with an almost massless gauge boson @xmath15 .",
    "( although this is our set up , it may not be necessary to consider an abelian gauge symmetry or even a lri to address the minos anomaly . )",
    "@xmath16 there are related works prior to our study about the lri effects on neutrino oscillations and the minos anomaly explanation with a new interaction .",
    "( for a limited list , see refs .",
    "@xcite . )    under the new potential , the effective muon neutrino survival probability in the 2-flavor oscillation limit can be described by the effective mass splitting and mixing angle @xcite : @xmath17 ^ 2 + \\sin^2(2\\theta_{23 } ) ) ^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath18 ^ 2 + \\sin^2(2\\theta_{23}))$ ] with @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( potential energy difference in @xmath21 ) .",
    "the @xmath22 flips sign for @xmath23 causing different effects on @xmath24 and @xmath23 unless @xmath25 .    in 1955 , t.d .",
    "lee and c.n .",
    "yang discussed that lris get constraints from the etvs - type experiments @xcite .",
    "the coupling constants ( fine - structure constants ) are constrained to be very small @xcite : @xmath26 ( for @xmath27 baryon number ) , @xmath28 ( for @xmath27 lepton number ) .",
    "so it is clear that we need astronomical sources to have any meaningful effects , which is possible since we are dealing with a lri .",
    "we assume @xmath29 to include the sun ( but not much smaller to avoid galaxy and beyond ) .    for an anomaly - free @xmath30 charges , we choose @xmath31 or @xmath32 .",
    "neutrons in the sun and the earth are the source of the new potential ( due to @xmath33 ) , and the flavor - dependent charges ( @xmath34 ) affect @xmath24 flavor oscillation .",
    "the sun and the earth have neutrons of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively , and the new potential by the neutrons is given by @xmath37 .",
    "since the minos @xmath24 oscillation is relevant to @xmath38 , a lri with @xmath39 level can affect minos experiments significantly .",
    "in other words , the @xmath24 oscillation experiments are a good probe of an extremely weak lri .",
    "we performed a rough fit to the minos data ( for both the neutrinos and anti - neutrinos ) with the lri , and found the best - fit point at @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 ) , using the simplified minos data from ref .",
    "( the minos data constrains @xmath44 at roughly @xmath45 level . )",
    "this best - fit point is not positively ruled out by solar+kamland @xmath24 and atmospheric @xmath24 data , although there is a tension between the potential for minos data and sk atmospheric @xmath24 data ( see [ sec : appendix ] ) .",
    "this best - fit with lri does not really improve the goodness - of - fit of the minos data over the sm fitting .",
    "we rather take it as a motivated benchmark point to explore other experiments to test the lri idea .",
    "for this purpose , we want to consider two setups , the icecube deepcore experiment , and the future long baseline neutrino experiment ( lbne ) .",
    "deepcore is composed of 6 additional densely instrumented strings plus 7 nearby icecube strings , and it is located in the bottom center of the icecube experiment at the south pole . it was recently commissioned and the analysis of the first year data is in progress ( see f. halzen s talk ) .",
    "deepcore is a high statistics detector that can study the atmospheric neutrino with precision @xcite",
    ". it can trigger @xmath46 atmospheric neutrinos per year in @xmath47 , which is complementary to the original icecube ( optimized for @xmath48 ) .     the @xmath2 disappearance at the future lbne ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 water cherenkov detector , 5-years run ) .",
    "the shapes and colors of the curves are the same as fig .",
    "[ fig : deepcore ] . ]",
    "the @xmath2 disappearance at the future lbne ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 water cherenkov detector , 5-years run ) .",
    "the shapes and colors of the curves are the same as fig .",
    "[ fig : deepcore ] . ]",
    "we would like to see the lri effects on the atmospheric muon neutrino disappearance at deepcore .",
    "figure  [ fig : deepcore ] shows the numerical results without a full detector simulation .",
    "the black dashed curve is for the unoscillated case , the black solid curve is for the standard oscillation , and the red solid curve is for the minos best - fit case .",
    "it shows that lri effects on the deepcore atmospheric muon neutrino disappearance experiment are quite distinct from the standard oscillation .",
    "another interesting aspect that we may be able to observe at the deepcore experiment is the annual modulation in the new potential .",
    "since the distance between the sun and the earth changes over the year ( about 3% level ) , the new potential would have an annual modulation , which means that the effective oscillation parameters might change with seasons . with an assumption of uniform flux ( before oscillation ) over the year",
    ", our calculation shows it can give a percent level annual modulation in the muon neutrino disappearance experiment , with a total number of a few thousands per year .",
    "now , we consider the implication for the future lbne .",
    "figure  [ fig : dusel ] shows the muon neutrino disappearance experiments for the envisioned lbne at dusel .",
    "it assumes the baseline of @xmath49 and 200 kton water cherenkov detector @xcite . as it shows , for the first minimum , the muon neutrino with the new potential has fewer events than the standard oscillation , which means larger @xmath51 .",
    "the corresponding result for the muon antineutrino has more events ( or smaller @xmath51 ) at the first minimum .",
    "the lbne can tell the different lri effects on @xmath24 and @xmath23 .",
    "the observation of the annual modulation effect , however , may need enhanced capabilities compared to what we considered .",
    "let us make a brief comment on the implications of the lri for the charged lepton sector .",
    "we have a lepton - flavor - dependent @xmath14 gauge symmetry with a nearly massless gauge boson @xmath15 .",
    "when we have a flavor - dependent u(1 ) gauge symmetry , @xmath15-mediated flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) at tree - level are present , in general .",
    "for instance , @xmath52-@xmath53-@xmath15 vertex may exist in the mass eigenstate .",
    "the question is whether we can neglect this @xmath15-mediated fcnc because it has a tiny coupling ( @xmath54 ) as constrained by the etvs - type experiments .",
    "we can not neglect this , in general , because of the goldstone boson equivalence principle .",
    "for instance , the @xmath55 decay is enhanced since @xmath56 .",
    "then , @xmath57 can lead to a too fast muon decay because of the extremely small @xmath58 .",
    "thus , explicit model buildings with higgs sector should address this issue .",
    "minos data may be a hint for the new physics which acts differently on neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "the lepton - flavor - dependent lri with @xmath59 is such a possibility since neutrino oscillations are sensitive to it .",
    "the icecube deepcore experiment , which is an ongoing experiment , can test this possibility .",
    "especially , if the annual modulation is observed , it can point to the solar origin of the new potential .",
    "a future lbne can test if the lri gives different effects on the neutrino and antineutrino oscillations .",
    "lri effects on the charged lepton sector are not negligible , in general , and depend on the explicit higgs sector model building .",
    "our minos best - fit is at @xmath42 or at the potential energy @xmath43 .",
    "the constraint on the lri from the solar neutrino and kamland reactor neutrino was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , which is , for our model , @xmath44 at @xmath45 level .",
    "the constraints from the atmospheric neutrino data measured at the super - kamiokande is given in terms of the @xmath60 with @xmath61 at @xmath62 cl @xcite .",
    "its corresponding value for the potential energy ( @xmath63 ) depends on @xmath12 ( electron number density ) .",
    "the earth core ( @xmath64 ) has @xmath65  ( @xmath66 ) and the mantle ( @xmath67 ) has @xmath68  ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "our minos best - fit potential energy is somewhere in the middle , which shows some tension though it calls for a more detailed analysis in order to pinpoint a precise constraint on the lri .",
