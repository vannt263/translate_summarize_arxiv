    "the vast majority of the free electrons in the ism of the milky way reside in a thick ( @xmath1pc scale height ) diffuse layer , which fills about 20% of the ism volume , with a local midplane density of about 0.1 .",
    "such a phase is now known to be a general feature of external star - forming galaxies , both spirals ( e.g. , walterbos 1998 ; otte etal .",
    "2001 , 2002 ) and irregulars ( e.g. , hunter & gallagher 1990 ; martin 1997 ) .",
    "it is referred to as the warm ionized medium ( wim ) or the diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) . for edge - on spirals , only in the more actively star - forming galaxies",
    "does the gas manifest itself as a smooth , widespread layer of emission detectable above the  region layer ( rand 1996 ) .",
    "it is generally believed that ostars , confined primarily to widely separated stellar associations near the galactic midplane , are somehow able to photoionize a significant fraction of the ism not only in the disk but also within the halo , 12kpc above the midplane .",
    "the heating of the wim or dig remains poorly understood , however . as shown by madsen ,",
    "reynolds & haffner ( 2006 ) , the temperatures of the galactic wim is 20003000k higher than that of galactic  regions .",
    "interestingly , the ratios of forbidden lines such as ,  or  with respect to have been shown to anticorrelate with the wim / dig  surface brightness ( e.g. rand 1998 , hereafter r98 ; madsen , reynolds & haffner 2006 ) .",
    "the fainter the emission brightness , the higher these ratios become .",
    "a similar trend is found with scale height @xmath2 above the disk in edge - on galaxies .",
    "reynolds etal .",
    "( 1999 : rht ) propose that an increase in gas temperature may suffice to explain such increase in line ratios .",
    "the detailed study by collins & rand ( 2001 ) of the dig in four edge - on galaxies suggests , however , that a systematic increase in ionization , at least of the fraction of o@xmath3 , might be required as well to account for the observed trends .",
    "turbulent mixing layers ( hereafter tml ) induced by a hot wind is one of the mechanisms considered by r98 to provide supplemental ionization and heating .",
    "it allowed the author to satisfactorily reproduce the line ratios observed in the dig of the edge - on spiral  ( situated at @xmath4mpc ) . in order to obtain a reasonable fit , however , the mixing layer model had to be combined with a varying proportion of matter - bounded photoionized condensations .",
    "in this composite model , the photoionization models were taken from j. sokolowski ( more information can be found in bland - hawthorn etal .",
    "2001 ) while the mixing layer calculations were borrowedk and depleted gas metallicities . ] from slavin , shull & begelman ( 1993 : hereafter ssb ) .",
    "in the current work , we propose two improvements to the heuristic _",
    "composite _ model introduced by r98 : a ) an integrated model : the mixing layer and the matter - bounded photoionized condensations are calculated as a single gas component submitted to an external ionizing flux , b ) better turbulence microphysics : rather than considering a single tml temperature given by the geometrical mean of the warm and hot phases , we derive a temperature structure for the tml using the mixing length scheme presented by cant & raga ( 1991 ) , later implemented in the emission line code  ( binette etal .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the equations describing a turbulent mixing layer and their implementation in the code are discussed in  [ sec : eqn ] .",
    "the results obtained from calculations of the tml structure and of its emission line spectrum are presented in  [ sec : mod ] and compared with the line ratios from the dig of .",
    "a brief discussion follows in  [ sec : dis ] .",
    "it is not so clear what exactly the difference is between `` standard '' shock wave heating ( i.e. , heating and/or ionization due to the passage of a single , well defined shock wave ) , and the heating that takes place in a compressible , turbulent mixing layer . in particular , it is not entirely clear whether such a turbulent layer actually generates a number of weak shock waves , or whether it has a turbulent cascade ending in turbulent dissipation without the appearance of shock waves .",
    "the initial work on the theory of astrophysical turbulent mixing layers was presented by kahn ( 1980 ) in the context of herbig - haro jets .",
    "kahn studied the linear and quadratic perturbation theory of the interface at the edge of a jet flow .",
    "the linear theory was studied by a number of authors in considerable detail in the context of extragalactic jets in both the gas dynamic and the magnetohydrodynamic contexts ( see , e.g. , the review of bodo 1998 ) . for the radiative herbig - haro jet case ,",
    "numerical simulations have been carried out , e.g. , by rossi et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) and by stone , xu & hardee ( 1997 ) .",
    "analytic models based on the standard `` turbulent viscosity '' approach ( with a turbulent viscosity parameterized with a simple , `` mixing length '' approximation ) were computed by cant & raga ( 1991 ) and noriega - crespo et  al .",
    "also , dyson et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) , lizano & giovanardi ( 1995 ) and taylor & raga ( 1995 ) computed models that included more or less detailed treatments of the chemistry associated with mixing layers .",
    "however , these models did not include a proper calculation of the ionization state and line emissivity of the ionized regions of these flows .",
    "binette etal .",
    "( 1999 ) adopted the mixing layer scheme developed by raga & cant ( 1997 ) and incorporated the ionization evolution of all the species considered and the integration of the full emission line spectrum from the mixing layer .",
    "these initial calculations were intended to explain the spectrum from small excitation knots observed in herbig - haro objects .    in the context of of the interstellar and the intracluster medium ,",
    "begelman and fabian ( 1990 ) proposed a prescription for evaluating the temperature of a turbulent mixing layer . in a subsequent work",
    ", ssb used the same prescription to calculate the emission line spectrum from such layers .",
    "their model included radiative transfer , which allowed these authors to consider the effect of the ionizing photons emitted by the mixing layer itself .",
    "these calculations were used by r98 in his study of the  dig .    for the current work",
    ", we adopted the mixing length prescription of binette etal .",
    "( 1999 ) , described below .",
    "we also incorporated radiative transfer , which will allow us to considers the impact of ionizing photons that originate not only from the internal diffuse field produced by the mixing layer , but from external sources as well , such as the ionizing uv from  regions .      for simplicity , we assume an infinite plane interface , along which a hot wind of temperature  is flowing supersonically with velocity  with respect to a static warm gas layer of hydrogen number density  and temperature .",
    "the turbulent mixing layer that develops between the hot and warm phases has a geometrical thickness , as described in the diagram of fig.[fig : dia ] . for the case of a thin , steady state ,",
    "high mach number radiative mixing layer , the advective terms along the direction of the mean flow can be neglected with respect to the corresponding terms across the thickness of the mixing layer ( see binette etal .",

    "eq.[eq : vel ] can be integrated to obtain the linear couette flow solution : @xmath12 where  is the thickness of the tml and   the mean velocity of the hot wind ( directed parallel to the static warm phase s surface ) .",
    "this solution can be substituted in eq.[eq : flo ] , which can then be integrated to derive the temperature cross - section across the layer .    within the tml , we consider the equations governing the _ fractional _ abundance @xmath13 of each species @xmath14 .",
    "this abundance must satisfy the equation : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the net sink term ( including collisional ionization , radiative and dielectronic recombination , charge transfer ... and processes which populate the current species ) of the species @xmath14 .",
    "the turbulent diffusivity , @xmath17 , is of order unity and assumed to be position - independent . at the inner and outer boundaries of the mixing layer ,",
    "the ionization fractions are set by the equilibrium values .",
    "to complete the description of the mixing layer , we require lateral pressure equilibrium ( which determines the density of the flow along the axis @xmath6 ) , and calculate the turbulent viscosity with a simple , mixing length parametrization of the form : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and  are the mass density ( ) and sound speed ( respectively ) averaged denotes _ averages _ across the mixing layer , see appendix[app : a ] . ] over the cross - section of the mixing layer ,  is the geometrical thickness of the mixing layer ( fig .",

    "our treatment of the tml can be extended to cover the subsonic case by replacing  in eq.[eq : mu ] by , whenever @xmath23 ( see appendix[app : a ] )",
    ".    considering that the turbulent conduction and diffusion prandtl numbers are of order one , we can compute the conduction coefficient as @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 is the heat capacity per unit mass averaged across the mixing layer cross - section ) and the diffusion coefficient as @xmath26 . in this way",
    ", we obtain a closed set of second order differential equations , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : flo ] ) and ( [ eq : ion ] ) , which can be integrated with a simple , successive overrelaxation numerical scheme .",
    "we use the code  ( ferruit etal .",
    "1997 ) to compute the radiative energy loss term @xmath8 and the photoheating term @xmath9 ( eq.[eq : flo ] ) at each position across the tml .",
    "at both the inner and outer boundaries of the mixing layer , we assume equilibrium ionization of the different species , while across the layer , our simple overrelaxation scheme is used to determine the ionization fractions ( eq.[eq : ion ] ) . for the ion diffusion of each species",
    "@xmath13 , the spatial differential equations are converted to temporal equations , with the use of pseudo - time steps @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the average h number density .",
    "this allows us to use the temporal algorithm previously described in binette & robinson ( 1987 ) for determining the spatial diffusion of the ionic species .",
    "the radiative transfer is determined by integrating ( from the hot layer @xmath29 down to @xmath30 ) the intensity of the uv diffuse field that the layer produces , assuming the _ outward only _ approximation .",
    "any external uv radiation impinging from the external side is simply added to the diffuse field at the onset of the integration .",
    "the intensity of the external ionizing field is defined by the ionization parameter as follows : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the speed of light ,  the flux number of ionizing photons impinging on the tml , and , the total h density at @xmath30 .",
    "the flux  is the sum of two components :  resulting from external uv sources such as hot stars and  due to the x - ray diffuse field generated by the hot wind ( of column  and average temperature ) .",
    "the absorption processes that are taken into account in the transfer equations across the tml include all the relevant photoelectric cross - sections of the ions present .",
    "collins & rand ( 2001 ) used a method based on  to estimate the gas temperature and , by bootstrapping , they could infer the ionization fractions of n and other species .",
    "they find that the hydrogen ionization fraction in  is as high as 0.550.80 . because h is fairly ionized and since x - ray ionization is very inefficient in comparison with uv radiation , we infer that their role relative to the soft uv flux from stars must be relatively unimportant .",
    "we therefore neglected the term  by setting  to a negligible value .",
    "for all the calculations presented in this work , the mixing layers are considered immersed in the radiation field that escapes from  regions located in the disk .",
    "this picture assumes that disk  regions are on the whole matter - bounded .",
    "according to beckman etal .",
    "( 2000 ) , zurita etal .",
    "( 2002 ) and relao etal .",
    "( 2002 ) , the fraction of lyman photons that escape giant  regions ( labeled `` leakage fraction '' in  [ sec : sed ] ) may lie in the range of 3050% .",
    "the impact of photoionization on our tml model can be inferred from the internal behavior of  across the layer , where  is defined as follows : @xmath33 the quantity  is zero when the temperature corresponds to the equilibrium value and tends toward unity when cooling becomes much stronger than heating . in our calculations ,",
    "we iteratively determine  at @xmath30 until @xmath34 is obtained .",
    "after computing the emission line spectrum of a given tml , offers the option of separately computing the emission lines generated by the inner photoionized layer ( i.e. @xmath35 in fig.[fig : dia ] ) where equilibrium ionization prevails . a simple isobaric photoionization model is calculated in this case , using the radiation field that has _ not _ been absorbed by the mixing layer .",
    "the total line spectrum from all the layers is then given by the _ sum _ of the line intensities from both the tml and the static equilibrium photoionization calculation .",
    "for all the models studied , however , whenever a static photoionized layer was included , it dominated the total spectrum and dwarfed the spectral signature of the turbulent layers . in order to enhance the contribution of the tml and successfully fit the ratios observed in , the static equilibrium region must be obviated and the total thickness of the emission layer becomes equal to that given by the turbulent layer alone .",
    "this might come about in a 3d geometry if the cold gas were to reside in the core of dense condensations whose _ area _ is much smaller than that of the surrounding turbulent layers .",
    "since the mixing layer is isobaric , with pressure , the density profile depends on the behavior of the temperature within the layer itself .",
    "the value of  is set by two quantities evaluated at the inner tml boundary ( @xmath30 ) : the density   and the equilibrium temperature . to be definite",
    ", a density of @xmath36 was adopted that applies to all models presented in this work .",
    "at such a low density , the _ low density regime _ fully applies and the calculated line ratios are therefore independent of the actual value used , provided the product  is conserved .",
    "our models are appropriate for any density @xmath37 .",
    "when the external parameters ( ,  and ) are kept constant , tml models turn out to be equivalent whenever the product of the hdensity  and thickness  is the same .",
    "therefore , at least in the low density limit regime typical of the dig , it is sufficient to specify the quantity ( fig.[fig : dia ] ) . ]",
    "=  to uniquely define a model .",
    "we found that the temperature of the hot wind is not a critical parameter of the tml models .",
    "its value can be varied and still result in a sequence of equivalent models ( i.e. with similar line ratios ) , provided the value of  is kept constant . for this reason",
    ", we adopted the same value of @xmath38k for all the models presented in this work . to summarize , in order to compute solutions to the mixing layer",
    ", we must first define the external radiation field and then specify the values of the following parameters : the mixing layer s , the ionization parameter , , and finally the velocity of the hot wind , , and its temperature , which we kept constant at @xmath39k .",
    "unless otherwise specified , the abundances of the elements are solar ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) and have the following values : ( he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ca , ar , fe ) @xmath40 \\times 10^{-6}$ ] relative to h ( by number ) .",
    "depleted or oversolar metallicities resulted in line ratios difficult to reconcile with the forbidden line ratios observed in .",
    "the first step consists of defining the spectral energy distribution ( ) of the ionizing radiation field _ reaching _ the dig .",
    "a useful constraint is provided by the observed /  ratio . in a previous observational work on , rand ( 1997 ) measured a ratio of @xmath41 , which he estimated implies a ratio of he ionizing photons to h ionizing photons , / , of about 0.08 . to be consistent with this datum",
    ", rand favors a stellar temperature of 37500k . in the calculations presented here , we adopt a similar temperature of 38000k .",
    "the atmosphere models used in  are from hummer & mihalas ( 1970 ) . as in r98",
    ", we assume that only a fraction of the stellar radiation escapes the  regions in the spiral disk to reach the dig . to be definite ,",

    ", we have computed a plane - parallel photoionization model and extracted the photon spectrum at a depth where 80% of the ionizing photons have been used up .",
    "the diffuse ionizing radiation from the slab itself has been included .",
    "the resulting  is shown in fig.[fig : mod ] ( solid line ) . because this modified contains few ionizing photons beyond 24.6ev , the mixing layer model presented below is characterized by an @xmath42 ratio as low as @xmath43 .",
    "this suggests a higher stellar temperature for  than considered here and in rand ( 1997 ) , or a larger leakage fraction than assumed above .",

    "the hot wind velocity is 84 , while the ionization parameter is @xmath44 and the layer s column @xmath45 .",
    "the inner boundary is characterized by an equilibrium temperature of @xmath46k . as illustrated in fig.[fig : gam ] , due to the very hot wind temperature ( @xmath47 ) ,  increases monotonically to reach unity at @xmath29 as a result of the cooling term becoming progressively dominant relative to the photoheating term .    the ionization structure within the same tml",
    "is shown in fig.[fig : ion ] .",
    "the static layer if it was present would have ionization fractions quite similar to those found at the extreme left in this figure .",
    "line intensities depend on temperature , but scales also with density square .",
    "since the quantity @xmath48 decreases strongly with increasing thickness ( see thick grey dashed line ) , the local emissivities likewise decrease markedly towards the right .",
    "it is therefore apparent that any emission from  or any other species with similar or higher ionization potential are produced in this model only within the mixing layer , and not within the static layer",
    ". this would of course be different if a significantly higher stellar temperature was chosen .      for comparison with tml models we selected the work of r98 on the dig in .",
    "the data on this object present the following advantages : the spectral data are homogeneous , they are of sufficient quality to reveal subtle intrinsic correlations among the line ratios observed at different positions across and along the disk of this edge - on spiral , finally , mid - infrared halo and disk observations with the spitzer space telescope are now available ( rand etal . 2008 ) .",
    "we postulate that the line ratio correlations are a direct manifestation of the dig excitation mechanism rather than positional changes in gas metallicity or in effective stellar temperature . to optimize the comparison with models , we present the line ratios in fig.[fig : seqa ] in a format which reveals the essential trends found by r98 in his long slit data .",
    "the three ratios /h@xmath0  ( 5007/4861 ) , /  ( 6300/6563 ) and /(6583/6716 ) are all plotted against the same ratio /(6716/6563 ) .",
    "the /h@xmath0  line ratio lies below unity in all measurements ( panel_a _ ) .",
    "what is most striking about the data is that not only do the forbidden line intensities , increase along with / , but the high excitation /h@xmath0ratio as well .",
    "such a behavior runs counter to the predictions of simple photoionization models where /h@xmath0  increases markedly when the ionization parameter is increased , while the ratios / , /  or /  all decrease .",
    "this leads to the proposition by r98 and collins & rand ( 2001 ) that another ionization process besides photoionization is likely to be involved . with the milky way digs ,",
    "the derived temperatures are found to increase along with the increase of the forbidden lines relative to  or h@xmath0  ( e.g. madsen etal .",
    "according to rht , a systematic temperature increase might be all that is necessary to reproduce the increase in the forbidden line intensities .",
    "again , this runs counter to predictions of simple photoionization models where the temperature is quite insensitive to changes in the value of .",
    "hence various authors have concluded in the existence of a new heating ( e.g. rht ) and possibly ionizing mechanism ( e.g. r98 ) in addition to photoionization . for the sake of completeness ,",
    "we included an inset in fig.[fig : seqa ] ( panel_d _ ) where the  temperature computed in models is plotted against /.",
    "we may reasonably expect that any realistic dig models should show a significant temperature gradient in such a diagram .",
    "we carried out an extensive exploration of the parameter space in order to determine the parameter range that could best reproduce the trends present in fig.[fig : seqa ] .",
    "as in previous studies , we concur that the layer has to be matter - bounded , otherwise the /  ratio would significantly exceed the observed values .",
    "furthermore , for the calculations to show a significant departure from steady - state photoionization as a result of turbulent dissipation and ionization mixing , it required an extremely thin layer , with a column  of order @xmath49  only .",
    "this raises concerns about the efficiency of turbulent dissipation to contribute significantly to the dig emission , as discussed in  [ sec : dis ] . because the tml layer in the composite model of r98 was decoupled from the photoionized component , the author was free to adopt a much larger column of @xmath50  in his matter - bounded photoionization calculations .",
    "a characteristic of the dig is its relatively weak  line intensity , which favors relatively small values for the ionization parameter when considering photoionization ( e.g. sokolowski & bland - hawthorn 1991 ) . in the case of the composite tml models of r98 ,",
    "the author has employed values that varied between @xmath51 to @xmath52 . in the tml regime that we have explored , we are lead towards similar values , with  typically at @xmath53 .",
    "we find that the  flux is the result of turbulent dissipation rather than of photoionization . on the other hand ,",
    "low ionization species responsible for lines such as , , ... are mostly caused by photoionization , but the additional heating due to turbulent dissipation causes these lines to become much brighter .",
    "in fact , if a static layer ( see fig.[fig : dia ] ) with such a low value of  was present behind the tml , the overall line ratios would lie near /=0.93 , /=0.087 and /=0.013 .",
    "therefore , these ratios would all lie outside the boundaries from the three line diagrams _ a _ , _ b _ and _ c _ of fig.[fig : seqa ] .",
    "if we relied only only photoionization ( without any tml ) to fit the observations , we would have to adopt a much harder ionizing  ( but see  [ sec : sed ] ) to provide the necessary heating and the ionization up to o@xmath54 .      in fig.[fig",
    ": seqa ] , we superpose a sequence of tml models to the data , in which the wind velocity is progressively increased in locked steps , by 0.1dex , from @xmath55 to 133(corresponding to mach numbers increasing from = 2.53 to 13.5 ) .",
    "the column  was set to @xmath56  and  to @xmath51 .",
    "in that sequence , the forbidden line ratios of /h@xmath0  and /h@xmath0  increase with increasing .",
    "we note that the temperature inferred from the  ( 5755/6583 ) line ratio , , increases slightly along with / , as shown in the upper right inset ( panel @xmath57 ) .",
    "overall , the trends in line ratios are well reproduced , better in fact than with the composite ( photoionization+tml ) model of r98 , which is represented by the dotted line .",
    "r98 showed that the line ratios not only correlate with decreasing  surface brightness , but also with increasing @xmath2 height above the disk of .",
    "if the  sequence of models were a valid description of the long - slit measurements of r98 , this would imply that the wind velocity is increasing with @xmath2 .",
    "alternatively , it is possible to reproduce the line ratio correlations by varying the ionization parameter instead of . in fig.[fig : seqb ] , we show a sequence of models in which both  and  increase in lock steps by 0.2dex , while  is kept constant at 85 .",

    "varying  in locked steps with the ionization parameter limits the variations in opacity , which is desirable otherwise the tml layers either get too thin or reach a regime in which photoionization takes over . in the sequence shown in fig.[fig : seqb ] , we have ensured that photoionization does not become the dominant process .",
    "in fact ,  and the other forbidden lines actually decrease as  is increased .",
    "for instance ,  gets weaker as  increases because the average gas temperature where it is produced _ decreases _ along the sequence from 51500 to 40300k .",
    "this sequence of models shows a  temperature gradient ( fig.[fig : seqb]_d _ ) that is stronger than in the previous sequence ( fig.[fig : seqa]_d _ ) . when compared to the data on , the behavior of the /h@xmath0  ratio is not as closely fit as in the sequence , but the fit of the other line ratios are better .",
    "although this study focuses on , fitting similar line ratio trends in other objects is certainly achievable . in itself",
    ", this does not validate tml models , since the main reason for this is the higher number of free parameters that can be varied and which were already numerous in the alternative case of pure photoionization .",
    "although forbidden line ratios with respect to  or h@xmath0  increase with height @xmath2 above the midplane in , this behavior is not repeated in all spirals .",
    "cases for instance where /h@xmath0decreases or reverse trend with height @xmath2 are well documented in the studies of miller & veilleux ( 2003 ) , otte etal .",

    "voges & walterbos ( 2006 ) find sudden changes in this ratio . within the perspective of tml models ,",
    "these observations bring new constraints to the interpretations that models are able to provide .",
    "for instance , in cases where /h@xmath0  decreases with _ z _ , we find it improbable that  could be decreasing with height , as required by the sequence ( fig.[fig : seqa ] ) . in the case of the sequence ( fig.[fig : seqb ] ) , however , a tml interpretation would imply that  is increasing with height , which could only come about if the ambient gas pressure decreases faster with _ z _ than the local ionizing flux .",
    "the direct measurement of the  temperature is difficult owing to the intrinsic weakness of the  lines .",

    "in which none of the  emission is the result of photoionization but rather due to turbulent mixing and dissipation , we find that  is produced at a depth @xmath6 of very high electron temperature .",

    "are the measurements of the ,  and  fluxes of the dig in the halo ( 2measurements ) as well as in the disk ( 1measurement ) .",
    "interestingly , the observed /  ratio increases with height @xmath2 by a factor of three .",
    "this is qualitatively similar to the trends revealed by the optical ratios of /  or /h@xmath0 .",
    "our two tml sequences has /increasing along with /h@xmath0 , but the increase is only a factor two .",
    "the maximum values reached for the ratio /  are 0.067 and 0.070 , for the sequence and sequence , respectively .",
    "this is about 4.5 times too weak with respect to the observed halo value of 0.31 . in his analysis ,",
    "rand etal .",
    "( 2008 ) adopted a ne / o abundance 2.5 times higher ratio than the solar value (  [ sec : met ] ) .",
    "changing our abundance set might resolve this discrepancy .",
    "a photoionized turbulent mixing layer can reproduce the line ratio trends observed by r98 , if it is matter - bounded .",
    "our work confirms the initial intuition of r98 who mixed two causally unrelated ionized components in adhoc proportions : a tml component and a matter - bounded photoionized component .",
    "the main advantage of our integrated model is that the ionized slab considered is submitted in a self - consistent manner to both excitation mechanisms : turbulent dissipation and photoionization .",
    "adjusting the parameters so that the observed line ratios can be reproduced , however , comes at a price .",
    "the thickness of the tml layer becomes so small that the overall efficiency in generating emission lines becomes a concern .",
    "this can be illustrated as follows . from the definition of",
    ", the ionizing photon flux impinging on our putative mixing layer of area @xmath62 is @xmath63 , where  is @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in the case of pure photoionization , assuming ionization equilibrium , the luminosity is given by @xmath66  where  is a measure of the reprocessing efficiency , that reaches unity in the case of an _ ionization - bounded _",
    "layer , where all the ionizing photons are absorbed . when the  from the tml models are compared to",
    "that expected from this simple relationship , we find that the sequence is characterized by an efficiency  that goes from 0.013 to 0.0031 , as  is increased . in the case of the sequence ,",
    "goes from 0.0013 to 0.027 , as  and are increased .",
    "what is most problematic , is that the efficiency is lowest when turbulent dissipation is maximized , that is , in the regime where the /h@xmath0",
    "ratio is highest , whether we consider the sequence of figs.[fig : seqa ] or the sequence of fig.[fig : seqb ] .",
    "the efficiencies at the high /h@xmath0  end are only 0.0031 and 0.0013 , for the sequence and sequence , respectively .",
    "such an efficiency is uncomfortably low .",
    "this can be illustrated by using the observations of  by rand ( 1997 ) . with the long - slit perpendicular to the galactic plane of edge - on",
    ", the author measured an  surface brightness of @xmath67 at an height @xmath2=2kpc , where the /h@xmath0/ ratio peaks . assuming a distance of @xmath68mpc ( 1arcsec=46pc ) , the slit , perpendicular to the galactic plane , crosses the mid - plane of at 4.6kpc from the nucleus .",
    "we adopt 1  as the reference spatial scale .",
    "we integrate along the thickness of the layer , which we assume extends at most over 9kpc along the line of sight , so that the layer area  exposed to the uv flux arising from the midplane becomes 46pcarcsec@xmath69@xmath709000pc .",
    "the surface brightness derived from the  expression above becomes : @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the number of projected tml layers per arcsec ( at @xmath2=2kpc ) along the slit .",
    "hence , @xmath73 . for an efficiency  of 0.0013 and with = 0.4 , matching the observed surface brightness implies the unreasonable number of @xmath74 layerscm , which in any case leaves no space for the hot wind to flow if @xmath72 is large . ] per arcsec along the slit , assuming a density typical of the dig in the milky way ( = 1 ) .",
    "even if one raises this density by an order of magnitude , too many layers are still required . for higher density values beyond that",
    ", there would not be enough o stars to account for the required ionizing flux .    to summarize , it is possible to contrive the values of the parameters describing tml models so that the observed trends in line ratios are reproduced reasonably well",
    "however , the efficiencies of any successful models appear downright too insignificant . in its current form",
    "our tml model is therefore invalidated .",
    "we may speculate that the gradient in temperature between the hot wind and the warm photoionized gas is so steep that the mixing length approach explored by cant & raga is not directly applicable to the very hot wind surrounding the dig .",
    "values for the constant @xmath20 ( eq.[eq : mu ] ) about two orders of magnitude larger would be required so that turbulent mixing and dissipation could operate over a layer s thickness much larger than the very small values found in the current model .",

    "from eq.a3 in cant & raga ( 1991 ) , we obtain that the turbulent viscosity coefficient @xmath10 is given by : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 $ ] with @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( see their eqs.27 , 30 and 36 ) . @xmath80 and @xmath81 correspond to the adiabatic sound speed in the hot wind and in the static layer , respectively .",
    "the subindex @xmath82 denotes _ averages _ across the mixing layer .",
    "cant & raga ( 1991 ) refer to the @xmath83 case as the ` mixing layer limited ' case while the ` jet limited ' case corresponds to @xmath84    in the case where @xmath85 , since in the isobaric case @xmath86 , after multiplying the numerator and denominator by @xmath87 , we can rewrite the above expression as @xmath88 in the notation used in this paper , the constant @xmath20 simply corresponds to the ratio @xmath89 . in the transonic case or when",
