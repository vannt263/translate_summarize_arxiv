    "the far infrared ( fir ) continuum emission from the interstellar dust component allows one to probe deeper in to the denser regions of galactic star forming regions .",
    "a long term programme of studying galactic star forming regions is being pursued at the tata institute of fundamental research ( tifr ) using its 100 cm balloon borne fir telescope .",
    "this programme aims at high resolution ( @xmath3 ) mapping in two fir bands centered at wavelengths @xmath0 150 and 200 @xmath1 m , beyond the longest waveband of iras survey . the trans - iras wavebands help in detecting colder component of the dust .",
    "several galactic star forming regions have been studied leading to detection of cold dust ( upto 15 k ) and its spatial distribution ( e.g. ghosh et al 2000 , mookerjea et al 2000 ) .",
    "the present study deals with three regions selected on the basis of their association with powerful molecular outflow activity and their extended / complex morphology .",
    "these are : w3(oh ) , s 209 and s 187 regions .",
    "the galactic star forming region known as w3(oh ) , is a very unique and interesting source for several reasons .",
    "it is situated @xmath4 se of w3 ( main ) in the giant molecular cloud , along the prominent ridge of star formation in the perseus arm at a distance of 2.3 kpc .",
    "it is one of the most luminous high emission measure compact h ii region of shell type morphology ( dreher and welch 1981 ) . surrounding the ionized gas ,",
    "there exist dense molecular clumps which host spectacular sources of oh , h@xmath5o and ch@xmath6oh maser emission as well as a bipolar outflow source ( wink et al 1994 ) .",
    "tieftrunk et al ( 1998 ) have surveyed this region in the nh@xmath6 line in which they have detected extended emission .",
    "a strong far infrared source is associated with the h ii region ( campbell et al 1989 ) .",
    "w3(oh ) has received a lot of attention recently from cm , mm and sub - mm waveband researchers , though mostly concentrating on the higher spatial resolution of the very central few arc sec region . here",
    "we present the study of the distribution of dust in the general neighbourhood of w3(oh ) ( within a few parsec ) .",
    "the s209 region is an evolved h ii region with visible optical nebulosity in the outer galaxy .",
    "the ionized region is very extended and luminous in radio continuum .",
    "the emission at 1.4 ghz has been detected over 12@xmath77@xmath8 by fich ( 1993 ) .",
    "the associated molecular gas extends over a region of @xmath9 diameter , as inferred from the co survey of blitz , fich & stark ( 1982 ) .",
    "the co line velocity places s 209 complex at a galactocentric distance of 21 kpc , one of the outermost sites of star formation in the galaxy ( fich & blitz 1984 ) .",
    "molecular outflow activity has been inferred from broad co wings by wouterloot , brand & henkel ( 1988 ) .",
    "a h@xmath10o maser source has also been detected in the vicinity by cesaroni et al ( 1988 ) .",
    "the above indicators confirm that star formation is still in progress in the s 209 complex . despite its large heliocentric distance",
    "( 12 kpc ) , s 209 is expected to be detectable in infrared wavebands due to its high intrinsic luminosity .",
    "surprisingly , no study of the far infrared continuum emission from the s209 region exists in the literature .",
    "s 187 is an optical h ii region ( sharpless 1959 ) located at the near side of dark cloud l 1317 at a distance of 1 kpc , belonging to the orion arm in the galaxy .",
    "high angular resolution radio continuum map of this region shows the ionized gas to extend over @xmath11 with rich structures ( snell & bally , 1986 ) .",
    "association of this region with a large molecular cloud complex has been known since blair et al ( 1975 ) detected extended co emission from this region .",
    "bally & lada ( 1983 ) found first evidence for high velocity molecular outflow from s 187 , later confirmed to be of extended and bipolar nature by casoli , combes & gerin ( 1984a ) .",
    "the full extent of this molecular complex has become more evident from the large scale surveys ( though with crude gridding ) , carried out in @xmath12co and @xmath13co lines by casoli , combes & gerin ( 1984b ) and yonekura et al ( 1997 ) .",
    "various evidences of recent star formation activity in this region have been presented by zavagno , deharveng & caplan ( 1994 ) . the structurally rich emission from the molecular as well as the ionized gas , prompted us to study the emission from the dust component in s 187 .",
    "the next two sections describe the observations and the results .",
    "the galactic star forming regions associated with w3(oh ) , s209 and s187 were mapped using the 12 channel two band far infrared ( fir ) photometer system at the cassegrain focus of the tifr 100 cm ( f/8 ) balloon borne telescope .",
    "the photometer uses a pair of six element ( 2@xmath143 close packed configuration ) composite silicon bolometer arrays cooled to 0.3 k using a closed cycle @xmath15he refrigerator and it has been described in verma et al ( 1993 ) .",
    "the same region of the sky was viewed simultaneously in two fir bands with near identical fields of view of 1@xmath166 per bolometer , thus instantaneously covering an area of 6@xmath160 @xmath14 3@xmath164 in each band .",
    "the sky was chopped along the cross - elevation axis at 10 hz with a throw of 4@xmath162 .",
    "full details of the 100 cm telescope system and the observational procedure can be found in ghosh et al ( 1988 ) .",
    "these sources were observed in two different balloon flights with slightly different fir passbands of the photometer .",
    "the journal of observations and other details are presented in table 1 .",
    "the spectral responses of the two bands , relative responses of the detectors , absolute calibration of the photometer and other details specific to these two flights in 1993 and 1995 have been presented in ghosh et al ( 2000 ) and mookerjea et al ( 1999 ) respectively .",
    "the observed chopped signals have been deconvolved using an indigenously developed procedure based on the maximum entropy method ( mem ) similar to that of gull & daniell ( 1978 ) ( see ghosh et al 1988 , for details ) .",
    "the accuracy of the absolute aspect of the telescope was improved by using a focal plane optical photometer which detects stars ( in an offset field ) while the telescope scans the fir target source .",
    "the achieved absolute positional accuracy is @xmath0 0@xmath165 .      the data from the iras survey in the four bands ( 12 , 25 , 60 and 100 @xmath1 m ) for the regions around the three target sources were hires processed ( aumann et al , 1990 ) at the infrared processing and analysis center ( ipac , caltech ) .",
    "these maps have been used for extracting sources and quantifying interband positional associations and flux densities .",
    "the mem deconvolved tifr maps at 148 and 209 @xmath1 m and the hires processed iras maps at 12 , 25 , 60 and 100 @xmath1 m for the galactic star forming region w3(oh ) has been presented in figs . 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "similarly , the intensity maps for s209 at 138 , 205 @xmath1 m and the iras bands have been presented in a similar format in figs . 3 and 4 .",
    "due to limited dynamic range achieved in the 138 @xmath1 m band for s187 , the intensity maps for this source are shown only at 205 @xmath1 m and the iras bands ( fig .",
    "5 & 6 ) .    whereas the iras maps have very high dynamic ranges ( @xmath17 1000 ) , the same for the tifr maps",
    "is restricted to @xmath0 300 under the best circumstances .",
    "the contour levels displayed in tifr maps for each programme source depend on the detector noise condition ( which varied from time to time ) at the time of the corresponding observations .    the angular resolution achieved in the tifr bands is approximately represented by the deconvolved sizes of the point - like ( planet ) source in respective bands ( see table 1 ) .",
    "all three programme sources , w3(oh ) , s209 and s187 show extended emission in both the tifr bands .    the angular resolutions in the hires processed maps for each region are listed in table 2 , which depend on the observational details like relative orientation of scan tracks of the telescope boresight among different hcons ( aumann , fowler & melnyk 1990 ) .",
    "although extensions are seen in many iras bands , the tifr maps show superior angular resolution as a result of their smaller and circular beam .",
    "discrete sources have been extracted from the tifr and hires maps using a procedure described in ghosh et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "the longest wavelength channel ( tifr ch - ii ) map has been used as the primary band .",
    "the sources detected in this are associated with sources in other bands if they satisfy the positional match criterion ( @xmath18 separation with tifr ch - i and @xmath195 for hires bands ) .",
    "a total of nine sources in all three regions have been detected , details of which are listed in table 3 .",
    "six of these have been detected in both the tifr bands .",
    "all these nine sources have an association with hires source in at least one band ( 8 have associations in 2 or more iras bands ) .",
    "the listed flux densities have been obtained by integrating over a circle of 3@xmath20  diameter .",
    "six of these also appear in the iras point source catalog ( hereafter psc ) .",
    "the psc flux densities are also listed for comparison with those obtained from the hires maps .",
    "four of these six psc sources have upper limits in at least one iras band .",
    "this reflects the complexiety of the morphology of these regions .",
    "the dust temperatures in the fir , t@xmath21 , have been computed from the flux densities in the tifr bands , assuming an emissivity law of @xmath22 .",
    "these are also listed in table 3 .",
    "strong emission is seen in both 148 and 209 @xmath1 m bands from w3(oh ) and the peak position ( s2 ) matches with that of the iras psc source 02232 + 6138 ( fig .",
    "the corresponding source is also the strongest in all the four hires maps ( fig .",
    "2 ) . whereas in tifr bands s2 is resolved , it is pointlike in the iras bands .",
    "there are two other sources detected in both the tifr maps . the second brightest source ( s3 )",
    "has counterparts in 12 , 25 and 60 @xmath1 m maps and a clear extension in 100 @xmath1 m map .",
    "the diffuse emission has been detected in all the six bands .",
    "the extension of the isophot contours towards ne of w3(oh ) in the tifr bands , match remarkably well with the plume ( @xmath23 ) seen in the recent mapping in nh@xmath6 line by tieftrunk et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "in fact they concluded that the w3(oh ) core is much larger than thought earlier .      the total emission from a circular region of 16@xmath20 diameter around the strong peak w3(oh ) , are 9601 and 6305 jy at 148 and 209 @xmath1 m respectively .",
    "the fraction of this in diffuse emission has been estimated to be 15% and 13% respectively by subtracting the contributions from the detected discrete sources ( table 3 ) .",
    "a similar analysis of the iras - hires maps of the same region has quantified the diffuse emission to be 85% , 55% , 56% and 71% at 12 , 25 , 60 and 100 @xmath1 m respectively . it may be noted that since the mapping in tifr bands are carried out in sky chopped mode ( in contrast to the iras bands ) , some part of the diffuse emission with low spatial gradient could have been missed in these bands .",
    "the total infrared luminosty estimated from the entire region is 1.91@xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "there is a good correlation and structural similarity between the extended emission from the dust component in all the six bands .",
    "the complex emission structure has restricted the reliable source extraction for the iras point source catalog as evident from inconsistent flux densities in different bands for the main source corresponding to s 209 , iras 04073 + 5102 . however ,",
    "numerical aperture photometry on hires processed iras maps provide reliable estimates of flux densities .    the main source in s209 region is clearly resolved into two sources ( s5 & s6 ) at 205 @xmath1 m map and there is indication for the same in the 138 @xmath1 m map ( fig .",
    "3 ) . the strongest peaks in both the tifr bands ( s5 )",
    "coincide with the position of iras 04073 + 5102 .",
    "the neighbouring source s6 is associated with iras 04072 + 5100 . in 25 and 60 @xmath1 m iras bands ,",
    "s6 is clearly seen and an indication is present in the 12 @xmath1 m map ( fig .",
    "4 ) . the 100 @xmath1 m hires processed map does not resolve s5/s6 .",
    "chini et al ( 1984 ) have detected s 209 in 1-mm continuum and presented the thermal emission from the dust after correcting for the expected free free emission from the hot gas . using the flux densities at",
    "205 @xmath1 m and 1-mm , a very flat dust emissivity exponent of 0.64 has been found for this sub - mm region . in case",
    "the emission at 1-mm originates from a different colder dust component , then the above index is an underestimate .    the total emission from the s 209 region presented in fig .",
    "3 is 5548 and 4000 jy at 138 and 205 @xmath1 m respectively .",
    "the fraction of this in diffuse emission has been estimated to be 57% and 46% respectively by subtracting the contributions from the detected discrete sources . a similar analysis of the iras - hires maps of the same region ( fig .",
    "4 ) has quantified the diffuse emission to be 52% , 44% , 49% and 77% at 12 , 25 , 60 and 100 @xmath1 m respectively .",
    "hence right through the mid and far infrared region , a good part of the emission is in diffuse form .",
    "the total infrared luminosty estimated from the entire region is 2.0@xmath26 @xmath25 ( for distance = 12 kpc ) .",
    "balser et al ( 1995 ) have modelled their 8.7 ghz radio continuum measurements of the s 209 region ( @xmath27 ) and they conclude that the exciting source is either a zams o6.5 star or a o5 star depending on the data used ( vla / mpir ) .",
    "these stellar types correspond to a luminosity of 1.5 x 10@xmath28 @xmath25 or 6.8 x 10@xmath28 @xmath25 respectively ( thompson 1984 ) .",
    "the dynamic range of the tifr maps of s 187 region is rather limited due to larger than usual noise in the bolometer channels during these observations ( only the 205 @xmath1 m map presented here ) . the strongest source ( s9 ) associated with iras",
    "01202 + 6133 is resolved at 205 @xmath1 m ( fig .",
    "the morphology of the diffuse emission in the tifr band resembles the same in the hires maps ( fig .",
    "this is despite the fact that tifr observations used sky chopping whereas iras survey did not .",
    "the emissions in all the five bands are dominated by the source associated with iras 01202 + 6133 .",
    "most of the additional emission originates from an annular ring like structure of diamater @xmath29 .",
    "the ionized gas resides at the central cavity of the annular region as inferred from high resolution radio continuum map at 1.4 ghz ( snell & bally , 1986 ) .",
    "the position of the high velocity molecular outflow lies about @xmath30 west of s9 .",
    "the h@xmath5o maser source detected by henkel , haschick & gusten ( 1986 ) is positionally very close to the outflow source .",
    "no local enhancement can been observed in any of the tifr or hires bands at the location of the h@xmath5o maser / outflow source .",
    "the position of the nh@xmath6 core detected in the s 187 region ( jijina , myers & adams , 1999 ) , also does not show positional match with any peak in the maps of dust continuum emission .",
    "the total emission from the s 187 region presented in fig .",
    "5 is 7256 jy at 205 @xmath1 m .",
    "the fraction of this in diffuse emission has been estimated to be 55% by subtracting the contributions from the detected discrete sources . a similar analysis of the iras - hires maps of the same region ( fig .",
    "6 ) has quantified the diffuse emission to be 66% , 68% , 53% and 69% at 12 , 25 , 60 and 100 @xmath1 m respectively . for this source too , right through the mid and far infrared region , a large part of the emission is in diffuse form , which is quite expected considering the complex morphology of the region .",
    "the total infrared luminosty estimated from the entire region is 1.7@xmath31 @xmath25 ( for distance = 1 kpc ) .    using the mass of the molecular cloud associated with s 187 , as estimated by yonekura et al ( 1997 ) from their @xmath13co survey ( their cloud # 164 ) , we determine the average luminosity per unit mass to be @xmath0 2.2 @xmath32 .",
    "this value is very similar to that found for w 31 star forming complex ( ghosh et al 1989 ) .",
    "taking advantage of the nearly identical circular beams of the tifr bands and the simultaneity of observations , reliable maps of dust temperature and optical depth ( at 200 @xmath1 m , @xmath33 ) have been generated for w3(oh ) and s209 regions .",
    "the available dynamic ranges in both the tifr bands for these two sources allow us to meaningfully determine the dust temperature and optical depth distributions .",
    "these are presented in figs . 7 and 8 respectively .",
    "a dust emissivity law of @xmath34 has been assumed for this purpose .",
    "details of the procedure can be found in ghosh et al ( 2000 ) .    for w3(oh ) region , the distribution of @xmath33 shows a peak near the intensity peak but the t(148/209 ) distribution shows a plateau there ( fig .",
    ". some regions of higher dust temperature are also seen .",
    "the second peak in the optical depth map clearly corresponds to the matter distribtuion around 02236 + 6142 .",
    "the dust temperature at the position of iras 02232 + 6138 is 21 k , whereas the kinetic temperature of the nh@xmath6 component has been found to be 27 k ( tieftrunk et al 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , the shape of the @xmath33 distribution around iras 02232 + 6138 ( within @xmath30 ) resembles the gas distribution traced by nh@xmath6 .",
    "a detailed comparison should help understanding the gas - dust coupling in denser regions of star formation , like the interstellar environment around w3(oh ) .",
    "the t(138/205 ) and @xmath33 distributions for s209 show an almost anticorrelation ( fig .",
    "the hotspots are located near the two resolved sources in the 205 @xmath1 m map .",
    "most of the region in s 209 has the dust temeparture higher than 27 k and the presence of colder dust is limited to the outermost perifary .",
    "this is in contrast to w3(oh ) region where the dust is relatively cooler .",
