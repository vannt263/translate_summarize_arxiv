    "it is generally accepted that solar storms including flares , filament eruptions , and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) are manifestations of an explosive release of free magnetic energy stored in corona , involving large - scale disruption and restructuring of the coronal magnetic field .",
    "major contributors to the accumulation of coronal magnetic energy are 1 ) emergence of magnetic flux through the photosphere , and 2 ) small- and large - scale convective motions in the photospheric layers that shuffle around the footpoints of the coronal field lines @xcite .",
    "these two processes also transport magnetic helicity @xcite into the solar atmosphere .",
    "typically a higher content of free magnetic energy and relative helicity is found in active regions that are more flare productive or prior to more energetic flares @xcite .",
    "it is an appealing conjecture that there may exist a critical amount of helicity , above which an eruptive process is favored .",
    "this conjecture , however , is challenged by numeric experiments @xcite .",
    "further , the accumulation of sufficient energy may not guarantee the occurrence of eruptions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "overall , the pre - eruptive state of the coronal magnetic field and the conditions that signal impending eruptions remain elusive .    to understand the initiation of solar eruptions , both magnetic reconnection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ideal mhd instabilities have been under intense investigation . in particular , the helical kink instability has received a lot of attention , mainly motivated by the dramatic development of writhe in eruptive structures , most of which are filaments .",
    "these events exhibit both a winding of the filament threads about the axis , arguing for the existence of considerable twist , and an overall helical shape , indicating a writhed axis .",
    "this combination therefore strongly indicates the kink instability of a magnetic flux rope ( mfr ) , whereby magnetic twist ( winding of magnetic field lines around the rope axis ) is abruptly converted to magnetic writhe ( winding of the axis itself ) .",
    "the instability is triggered when the twist exceeds a threshold , whose precise value depends on the details of the configuration . with photospheric line tying included , the minimum threshold is a winding of the field lines about the rope axis by 1.25 turns .",
    "however , it has been under debate whether the kink instability plays a significant role in solar eruptions . a previous question on the sufficiency of twist in active regions",
    "@xcite was apparently settled by examining the magnetic fields in localized active - region mfrs @xcite , but there are more issues for consideration . first of all , eruptive structures with a clear writhing feature are relatively rare , which raises a question as to how often the kink instability triggers eruptions .",
    "second , twisted , helical patterns are often exposed only during eruptions .",
    "it is hence difficult to determine whether the twist is accumulated prior to the eruption or built up in the course of the eruption through reconnection in the vertical current sheet under the rope @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the magnetic reconnection flux in the low corona in the wake of cmes is comparable to that in the resultant interplanetary magnetic clouds , suggesting the formation of the helical structure of mfrs by reconnection .",
    "this raises a question as to whether the observed kink is actually a byproduct of the eruption .",
    "third , the shear component of the ambient field may cause a similar writhing of the current - carrying mfr as the kink mode .",
    "this may be excluded as an important process only in a few cases with dopplergrams available , where both the writhing motion in the early phase of the eruption and the un - writhing relaxation later on are detected @xcite , and in the few cases of extremely strong writhing resulting in apex rotations significantly higher than 90 degrees @xcite . and",
    "finally , hard x - ray and microwave emission at the projected crossing point of kinked filaments suggests that the their legs approach each other and interact near the crossing point .",
    "this is possible when the mfr is highly twisted @xcite .",
    "occasionally , high twist values are estimated for eruptive structures , but such estimates suffer inevitably from projection effects and large uncertainties .",
    "in contrast , nonlinear force - free field ( nlfff ) modeling often yields weakly twisted mfrs associated with pre - eruptive or quiescent filaments , in most cases with a twist below 1.5 turns .",
    "furthermore , numerical simulations have demonstrated that it is difficult for an mfr to rise coherently into the corona owing to the dense plasma trapped at the concave - upward portions of the twisted field lines ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "hence , one may hypothesize that the majority of pre - eruptive mfrs in corona are only moderately or weakly twisted .    here",
    "we present a study of the evolution of mfrs in relation to flares / cmes in noaa active region ( ar ) 11817 , which sheds light on the role of the kink instability in the flare / cme production . in this paper",
    ", an mfr is defined as a collection of magnetic field lines spiraling around the same axis by more than one full turn . by this rigorous definition , mfrs",
    "are identified without ambiguity through the nlfff modeling .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the nlfff extrapolation is capable of reconstructing mfrs and other topological features of active region magnetic fields , with high fidelity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the sections that follow , our methods of data reduction are described in section [ sec : data ] , the observations of the mfrs are presented in section [ sec : observation ] , and a discussion and concluding remarks are given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "for this study we used vector magnetograms obtained by the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ; * ? ? ?",
    "the data for hmi active region patches ( harps ) are disambiguated and deprojected to the heliographic coordinates with a lambert ( cylindrical equal area ) projection method , resulting in a pixel scale of @xmath4 or 0.36 mm @xcite .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that different projection methods make little impact on the deprojected map of a normal ar and on the calculation of the helicity flux .",

    "one of the flares produced by ar 11817 is captured by the 1.6-m new solar telescope ( nst ) at big bear solar observatory ( bbso ) with unprecedented high spatiotemporal resolution .",

    "* for more detail ) .      to monitor the evolution and complexity of the ar , we calculated the relative helicity flux across its photospheric boundary @xmath14 with the following formula @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the vector potential of the reference potential field @xmath17 that has the same vertical component on the photospheric boundary ; @xmath18 and",

    "is chosen to be 19 pixels , following @xcite .",
    "the first term in the above equation represents helicity injection due to the emergence of twisted flux tubes into the corona ; the second is due to photospheric motions that shear and braid field lines .",
    "similarly , both flux emergence ( @xmath22 ) and tangential motions ( @xmath23 ) contribute to the poynting flux across the photospheric boundary @xmath14 , which is given by @xcite @xmath24 readers are referred to appendix  [ append : error ] for an error analysis of helicity and poynting flux .",
    "to understand the magnetic connectivities within the active region and their evolution , we used the code package developed by t.  wiegelmann , which utilizes the `` weighted optimization '' method @xcite to build an nlfff model that approximates the coronal field ( see appendix  [ append : quality ] for the quality of nlfff ) .",
    "to best suit the force - free condition , the vector magnetograms are `` pre - processed '' @xcite before being taken as the photospheric boundary .",
    "our calculation is performed within a box of @xmath25 uniformly spaced grid points , whose photospheric fov is shown in figure  [ bfield ] .",
    "further , the free magnetic energy accumulated in the active region can be derived by subtracting the magnetic energy of the corresponding potential field from that of the nlfff ( see appendix  [ append : error ] for an error analysis of magnetic free energy ) .",
    "the potential field is calculated by the green function method .",
    "we calculated the free magnetic energy regularly on an hourly cadence , but at the highest cadence available ( 12 min ) around flares .",
    "it is clear that the nlfff is not a good model of the coronal active - region field during the impulsive phase of the flares , as plasma is accelerated , i.e. , forces are significant , primarily in this phase . however , the flare - related changes of the coronal field can be inferred from a comparison of the nlfff before and after the impulsive flare phase .    after obtaining the nlfff , we refined the photospheric computational grid by 16 times and traced magnetic field lines pointwise with a fourth - order runge - kutta method to ensure high precision .",

    "we will now examine this trend case by case .",
    "figures  [ tw0811t14][tw0812t10 ] show the twist maps across each flare studied ( table [ tbl ] ) .",
    "the decrease in magnetic twist is often related to a decrease in the free magnetic energy of the overall active region ( except flares no .  2 and 5 ) ,",

    "a similar issue happens to the magnetic twist when its change is detected 1020  min before flare no .  3 ( figure  [ tw0811t18 ] ) .",
    "this might indicate a limited accuracy of the underlying magnetograms or of the nlfff model , but it could also indicate that the flare is triggered by a photospheric evolution that starts already before the flare .",
    "we also noted that the height of the mfr gradually increases with time during the sequence studied ( compare the insets in figures  [ tw0811t14][tw0812t10 ] ) .",
    "we assume that the rise of the peak twist number @xmath3 at the axis of the mfr just prior to the flares is correlated with the on - axis value of the classical twist number @xmath108 .",
    "the relationship between these twist numbers is analyzed in appendix  [ append : tw ] , where we find that , at the axis , @xmath0 approaches the sum of @xmath41 and a geometry - dependent term which measures the deviation from cylindrical symmetry ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : tg&tw ] ) .",
    "the expectation that such a deviation is of minor influence on the stability of the mfr compared to the twist underlies our assumption , which should be substantiated in future investigations .",
    "the peak magnetic twist at the axis of the mfr can increase due to a twisting of the rope by rotational motions at its footpoints , or due to a lengthening of the rope by reconnection .",
    "the latter involves a change in the footpoints and likely also leads to a greater height of the rope . in the derived velocity maps by dave4vm , there are no obvious counterclockwise rotations associated with the footpoint regions as expected for the buildup of the left - handed twist , but we did find positive correlations among the peak @xmath3 , its height , and the length of the field line threading the peak @xmath3 position ( bottom panel of figure  [ helicity ] ) .",
    "thus , primarily reconnection should have caused the transient increase in @xmath3 prior to the flares .    for eruptive flares",
    ", it is readily understood that the decrease in magnetic twist must result from the expulsion of the flux rope , although a flux rope still survives the eruption in both cases studied ( flares no .  5 and 6 ) , suggesting that most likely a partial expulsion of the flux rope occurs during the eruption . in flare",
    "5 , the remnant mfr is significantly reduced in flux , height , and twist ( figure  [ tw0811t21 ] ) , eventually disappears , and then reforms about 2 hrs before flare no .",

    "the mfr splits into two remaining branches at a lower height immediately after the flare peak ( figure  [ tw0812t10 ] ) , suggesting that a reconfiguration of the flux rope might be ongoing .",
    "it is interesting that the two branches take the form of two interlocking js , which is the reverse of the double - j - to - s transformation that is typical of tether - cutting reconnection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for confined flares , the decrease in magnetic twist must indicate a conversion of magnetic energy primarily into plasma heating , but what mechanism causes this decrease is unclear until we have further analyzed flare no",

    "* ) , this event sheds some light on the flaring mechanism .",
    "figure  [ halpha ] shows the flaring process observed in aia 131   , which manifests as the brightening of a small sigmoid extending less than 50@xmath112 in the east - west direction . in the high - resolution h@xmath12 images",
    ", however , one sees a filament with a similar reverse s shape . @xcite",
    "have demonstrated that the filament traces the mfr .",
    "the filament axis is apparently writhed after the flare onset ( figure  [ halpha](f  g ) ) , with the counterclockwise rotation being consistent with the conversion of left - handed twist @xcite . the deformation of the filament axis appears to be moderate and the filament soon settles back down in approximately six minutes to a similar configuration as before the flare , indicating that the flare is confined .",
    "the fine threads of the filament do not appear to be twisted by significantly more than one turn , which is consistent with the range of twist values of the mfr derived from the nlfff modeling ( see appendix  [ append : tw ] ) .",
    "superimposing on the aia 131   image a representative field line of the mfr in the pre - eruption nlfff ( red dotted line in figure  [ halpha ] ) , one can see that the mfr matches the sigmoid very well .",
    "this is consistent with the sigmoid being energized beneath the erupting mfr . in the process of eruption the coherence of the filament is distorted , with some brightenings occurring in its rising part ( figure  [ halpha](f  g ) ) .",
    "this suggests that reconnection also occurs with the overlying field , which halts the eruption according to the analysis of the decay index in  [ subsec : struct ] .",
    "thus , although the writhe must be back - converted into twist as the filament settles back near its original shape , the mfr loses part of its twist by reconnection with the overlying field .",
    "a diagnosis of the flaring plasma with the dem method can shed more light on the energy release mechanism of this flare .",
    "one can see that immediately after the flare onset , the sigmoid is visible in each of the six euv passbands of aia ( figure  [ hot ] ) .",
    "we obtain the average dems for 3 by 3 pixels centered on three selected loci along the sigmoid ( red , olive and green crosses ) as well as on neighboring coronal loops ( blue cross ) to serve as a reference ( figure  [ hot](e ) ) .",
    "the dems of the sigmoid exhibit a significant peak at about 10 mk , besides the peak at about 1 mk that can mainly be attributed to the coronal background . both the cool and hot dem peaks of the sigmoid are significantly elevated above those of the neighboring coronal loops , suggesting that the sigmoid is both dense and hot .",
    "this sigmoid is obviously associated with the erupting filament observed in h@xmath12 ; however , its size and shape do not follow the expanding and writhing filament , but rather remain close to the initial state ( figure  [ halpha ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to the standard picture of the sigmoid being formed by current dissipation in a separatrix or quasi - separatrix layer underneath an activated flux rope .",
    "figure  [ qfactor](d ) indeed shows the highest squashing factor where the qsl intersects itself under the mfr ; this intersection is suggestive of the presence , or beginning formation , of a hyperbolic flux tube , where the flare reconnection is expected to develop .",
    "a location of the sigmoid under the flux rope is also supported by its high density .",
    "here we summarize what we have learned from the observations of a sequence of four confined and two subsequent eruptive flares and the associated vector magnetograms in ar  11817 , and how we interpret these observations .    *",
    "an mfr exists in the nlfff extrapolated from the magnetograms prior to each flare in the series ( where the closely associated flares no .  4 and 5 are considered to be a compound event ) .",
    "signatures of the mfr start to appear about 1.5 hours before the first confined flare , and it is reformed after a partial expulsion in the first eruptive flare . *",
    "the mfr s peak twist number @xmath3 temporarily increases within half an hour before each flare , while it decreases after the flare peak , for both confined and eruptive flares .",
    "the temporary increase in @xmath3 , assumed to reflect an increase in magnetic twist about the mfr axis , @xmath108 ( see appendix  [ append : tw ] ) , can only partly be attributed to the photospheric helicity injection , which is more or less quasi - static in nature , but signifies the additional importance of reconnection , in the present case including the axis of the mfr as well as tether - cutting reconnection in the outer parts of the rope , at the photospheric / choromospheric level .",
    "both are expected to occur episodically as opposite - polarity magnetic elements are randomly brought into contact at the pil by photospheric flows .",
    "the reconnection heats rope - like structures in the corona ( termed ` hot channels ' by some authors ) shortly before flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for confined flares",
    ", two interrelated mechanisms could be responsible for the reduction in the mfr s twist : 1 ) onset of the helical kink instability , which converts twist into writhe ; 2 ) current dissipation at the mfr s boundary , i.e. , qsl , which reconnects twisted field with the surrounding , untwisted field , so as to distribute magnetic twist into a larger volume .",
    "the latter is expected to be most efficient when the mfr loses stability and writhes .",
    "for eruptive flares , the reduction of magnetic twist in the source region is due to the ( partial ) expulsion of the mfr .",
    "* the temporary increase in the mfr s twist prior to flares leaves little imprint in the ar s free magnetic energy , while the decrease in the mfr s twist after flares corresponds to a stepwise decrease in free magnetic energy in most of the flares studied .",
    "this suggests that the additional free magnetic energy that is related to the trigger of the eruptions is very localized and modest compared with that released during the eruptions .",
    "this feature might have important implication for space weather forecasting .",
    "in contrast , none of the parameters derived for the whole active region , including magnetic flux , helicity and energy , gives such a clear signal for impending eruptions .",
    "* the mfr of interest is moderately twisted ( peak @xmath113 and peak @xmath114 ) .",
    "this is derived from the local twist number @xmath0 , the general definition of twist number @xmath41 , and the global kruskal - shafranov criterion in our series of nlfff models and indicates that the mfr is close to the threshold of the helical kink instability .",
    "the high - resolution nst observations of flare no .  3 also indicate the onset of this instability . a moderately twisted mfr results in mild writhing of the filament axis when the helical kink mode sets in , which can only be discerned with a spatial resolution much higher than that of any regular observations currently available .",
    "hence , the occurrence of the helical kink instability might be much more frequent than often thought . *",
    "the analysis of the decay index excludes the torus instability as the eruption onset mechanism for all the flares studied , since the mfr is located well below the height where the decay index reaches its threshold value . however , for the eruptive flares we expect that the helical kink lifts the mfr into the torus - unstable height range .",
    "this will be studied in the future using mhd simulations .",
    "to conclude , we found that an mfr existed prior to each investigated flare and that the twist number @xmath0 is useful in 1 ) identifying the mfr in conjunction with the squashing factor @xmath2 , 2 ) forewarning an mfr eruption , and 3 ) locating the magnetic axis of a coherent mfr .",

    "<S> we investigate the evolution of noaa active region 11817 during 2013 august 1012 , when it developed a complex field configuration and produced four confined , followed by two eruptive , flares . </S>",
    "<S> these c - and - above flares are all associated with a magnetic flux rope ( mfr ) located along the major polarity inversion line , where shearing and converging photospheric flows are present . aided by the nonlinear force - free field modeling </S>",
    "<S> , we identify the mfr through mapping magnetic connectivities and computing the twist number @xmath0 for each individual field line . </S>",
    "<S> the mfr is moderately twisted ( @xmath1 ) and has a well - defined boundary of high squashing factor @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the field line with the extremum @xmath3 is a reliable proxy of the rope axis , and that the mfr s peak @xmath3 temporarily increases within half an hour before each flare while it decreases after the flare peak for both confined and eruptive flares . </S>",
    "<S> this pre - flare increase in @xmath3 has little effect on the active region s free magnetic energy or any other parameters derived for the whole region , due to its moderate amount and the mfr s relatively small volume , while its decrease after flares is clearly associated with the stepwise decrease in the whole region s free magnetic energy due to the flare . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that @xmath0 may serve as a useful parameter in forewarning the onset of eruption , and therefore , the consequent space weather effects . </S>",
    "<S> the helical kink instability is identified as the prime candidate onset mechanism for the considered flares . </S>"
