    "the study of replicator models of prebiotic evolution has received considerable theoretical attention during the past three decades @xcite .",
    "there is a renewed and active interest in this subject owing to the crucial fact that the dynamics of real viral populations is known to be described by quasispecies @xcite . to date , the bulk of the theoretical work devoted to the analysis of quasispecies dynamics has tacitly assumed spatially homogeneous conditions @xcite .",
    "the importance of diffusive forces has begun to be recognized and taken into account @xcite , but rather less attention , if any , has been payed to the presence of the unavoidable internal density fluctuations @xcite that are necessarily present in all realistic incompletely mixed and diffusing systems of reacting agents @xcite . in the deterministic approach to chemical and molecular species that diffuse and react ,",
    "the fluctuations are simply ignored .",
    "nevertheless , it is well known that if the spatial dimensionality @xmath0 of the system is smaller than a certain upper critical dimension @xmath1 , the intrinsic fluctuations do play a decisive role in the asymptotic late time behavior of decay rates , and the results obtained from the mean field equations are not correct @xcite . even far from asymptotia",
    ", these fluctuations can strongly affect the dynamics on local spatial and temporal scales @xcite .",
    "the mean field limit is strictly valid only in the infinite diffusion limit , because the reactions themselves induce local microscopic density fluctuations that can be amplified by the underlying nonlinear dynamics .",
    "this internal noise is multiplicative , and scales as the square root of the product of concentrations , with the consequence that the noise does not necessarily vanish in the large particle - number limit .    given the relevance of molecular replicator models such as the quasispecies for viral dynamics and the key role played by fluctuations in nonlinear systems , this letter has a twofold objective .",
    "first , we outline a rigorous derivation of the exact stochastic partial differential equations ( spde ) that govern the dynamics of a simple quasispecies model ( denotes in this work a system comprised of a master plus mutant molecular species in competition for limited resources ) .",
    "second , we study the nature of the internal fluctuations on the replicator evolution . but in order to achieve this latter goal , we must also develop and apply a method suitable for simulating multi - component spde s with _ complex _ noise @xcite .",
    "the validity of this approach is confirmed by numerical simulation .",
    "neither of these objectives has been achieved before .",
    "we illustrate this method with a simple model that is analytically tractable , but the technique given here can be applied to more realistic chemical and molecular reaction processes .",
    "we consider a molecular quasispecies model with error introduced via the faulty self - replication of the master copy into a mutant species .",
    "the mutant species or , error - tail , undergoes non - catalyzed self - reproduction , but has no effect on the master species .",
    "the system is closed , only energy can be exchanged with the surroundings , where activated monomers react to build up self - replicative units .",
    "these energy rich monomers are regenerated from the by - product of the reactions by means of a recycle mechanism ( driven by an external source of energy ) maintaining the system out of equilibrium .",
    "the closure of the system directly imposes a selection pressure on the population . in what follows ,",
    "@xmath2 denote the concentrations of the activated energy rich monomers , the master and the mutant copies , respectively .",
    "the kinetic constants are introduced in the following reaction scheme .",
    "accurate replication with rate @xmath3 : @xmath4 error replication with rate @xmath5 : @xmath6 mutant - species replication with rate @xmath7 : @xmath8 degradation of the master and mutant copies into monomers with rates @xmath9 , respectively : @xmath10 re - activation of energy - depleted monomers ( induced by a generic energy - driven reaction ) : @xmath11 the quality factor @xmath12 $ ] . in order to keep the following development mathematically manageable",
    ", we will assume that the monomer reactivation step eq.([activation ] ) proceeds sufficiently rapidly , so that we can in effect , regard the decay of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , eq.([degradi ] ) , plus the subsequent reactivation @xmath15 as occurring in _",
    "one _ single step , i.e. , @xmath16 here , @xmath17 , @xmath18 are correspondingly , the combined _ effective _ decay plus regeneration rates of @xmath19 to the reactivated monomers @xmath20 , although in what follows , we will simply write @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this means that our continuum field theory , will depend on three @xmath23 , instead of four @xmath24 concentration field variables .",
    "if we suppose the system is being bathed continuously by an external energy source , the monomer reactivation eq.([activation ] ) is occurring continuously , and this should be a reasonable approximation . to complete the specification of the model , we allow for spatial diffusion .",
    "this is incorporated into the master equation associated with the above reaction scheme .",
    "the diffusion constants are denoted by @xmath25 and @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the constraint of constant total particle number is _ automatically _",
    "satisfied by the continuous chemical concentration fields in the mean - field limit .",
    "most importantly , this provides a selection pressure on the quasispecies .",
    "it is straightforward to write down the continuous time master equation corresponding to the above reaction scheme eqs .",
    "( [ ancatrep],[encatrep],[erep],[degradiprime],[degradieprime ] ) . this master equation",
    "is then mapped to a second - quantized description following doi @xcite . from doi s operator language",
    ", we then pass to a path integral representation in terms of continuous stochastic fields @xcite to obtain the following action @xmath28 valid for any space dimension @xmath0 ( d. hochberg , m .- p .",
    "zorzano and f. morn , unpublished notes ) : @xmath29 in the _ mean field _ limit the continuous field variables @xmath30 in eq.([shiftaction ] ) correspond to the physical densities of the molecules @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the fields @xmath32 , are conjugate to the internal fluctuations",
    ". only if this noise is real , do @xmath30 continue to represent the physical densities .",
    "otherwise , for imaginary or complex noise , these fields will likewise be imaginary or complex , but their stochastic averages @xmath33 , and @xmath34 do however correspond to the real physical densities @xcite .    since the @xmath32 fields appear quadratically in @xmath28 , we can make use of the hubbard - stratanovich transformation to integrate over them exactly in the path integral @xmath35}$ ] . this final step yields a product of delta - functional constraints which directly imply a set of exact coupled stochastic partial differential equations with specific noise properties ( see below ) .",
    "in particular , in a two - dimensional space and making the reasonable assumption that both master and mutant species diffuse equally @xmath36 and have equal effective degradation plus reactivation rates , i.e. @xmath37 , the reaction - diffusion system in _ dimensionless _ variables , and @xmath38 ; the dimensionless time @xmath39 and spatial coordinates @xmath40 .",
    "their corresponding derivative operators are @xmath41 , and @xmath42 the dimensionless noises are defined by @xmath43 , and @xmath44 . ] is given as follows : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the noise with @xmath48 and correlation matrix @xmath49 : @xmath50 the initial condition @xmath51 and the ratio of replication rates @xmath52 defines the _ scaled _ number of particles in the closed system @xmath53 . in the two - dimensional case",
    "the total number of particles is given by the ratio @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the ratio of the reaction to the diffusion processes ( in any dimension @xmath0 , we have @xmath56 ) . in the absence of noise @xmath57 this reaction - diffusion system has a set of homogeneous solutions : ( i ) @xmath58 , ( the trivial solution ) ; ( ii ) @xmath59 , if @xmath60 and @xmath61 ; and ( iii ) @xmath62 , @xmath63 if @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we want to understand how this deterministic , mean - field homogeneous solution , is modified by the internal multiplicative noise term with defined spatio - temporally varying covariance ( the fields vary in both space and time ) . from inspection of the covariance matrix @xmath66",
    "we see that this noise is proportional to @xmath67 , the ratio between the reaction and diffusion processes . in the limit @xmath68 ( infinite diffusion , i.e. , a perfectly homogeneous system )",
    "there are no fluctuations , and we recover the mean field result .",
    "the noise term vanishes when @xmath69 ( the trivial solution is an inactive state ) and/or when @xmath70 .",
    "if the system stays close to the mean field result , then @xmath63 and @xmath71 and @xmath72 scale as @xmath73 .",
    "therefore the noise covariance is expected to scale with @xmath74 .",
    "our main interest here is the limit when the stochastic term makes a significant contribution @xmath75 . in this regime",
    "the problem can not be analyzed by perturbation theory and thus must be treated numerically . and a spatial mesh of @xmath76 cells with cell size @xmath77 and periodic boundary conditions . ]    note that @xmath66 is a symmetric matrix with @xmath78 , i.e. it is negative definite .",
    "thus it either has one or three negative eigenvalues , suggesting that at least one noise component will have negative auto - correlation , and will therefore be imaginary .",
    "we expect this situation to be relatively common in reaction - diffusion systems with multiple species .",
    "we next apply the cholesky decomposition , which is used when the symmetric matrix is positive definite , to relate this correlated noise to an uncorrelated one .",
    "we apply this algorithm for the first time here to a case with negative definite correlation matrix to obtain the `` square root '' @xmath79 , where some of the terms are manifestly imaginary .",
    "this is very useful for relating the noise @xmath80 to a new _ real _ white gaussian noise @xmath81 with @xmath82 , such that @xmath83 : symmetric matrix @xmath66 , we can apply the cholesky decomposition @xmath84 to extract the square root of the matrix in the form of a lower triangular matrix @xmath79 with @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath87 . note that @xmath88 is automatically satisfied . ]",
    "@xmath89 this transformation allows us to separate the real and imaginary parts of the noise , a extremely useful feature to have for setting up and running a stable numerical simulation .",
    "the noise @xmath90 for the nutrient field @xmath91 , eq.([eta_a ] ) , _ always _ has an imaginary component and since all the equations are coupled to the nutrient @xmath91 , even if the initial condition for @xmath92 is real , the fields will , in principle , have both real and imaginary parts , and thus we have to solve a system of 6 partial differential equations , one for each field ( @xmath93 ) with two - dimensional diffusion and noise .",
    "we expect the imaginary fields to be zero in the average , since the stochastic averages @xmath33 , and @xmath34 correspond to the physical densities @xcite .    integrating the system",
    "numerically we confirmed that the scaled number of particles was conserved and remained _ real _ @xmath94 , and @xmath95 ( within computational errors ) . was set as small as possible .",
    "we confirmed that both @xmath96 and @xmath97 are conserved during the integrating time and that the results were independent of @xmath98 .",
    "] we found that , independently of the initial condition and noise intensity , it always converged to the same state with spatial fluctuations around this value : @xmath99 , @xmath100 , which is the mean - field solution , @xmath101 .",
    "the spatial average is denoted by @xmath102 , which by the ergodic hypothesis , is equivalent to averaging over the noise .",
    "] an example of these spatial fluctuations is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig ] ) at @xmath103 for @xmath104 and @xmath105 , with @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 . in the case of @xmath71 and @xmath72 ,",
    "the densities show spatial fluctuations of up to @xmath109 ( in white ) and @xmath110 ( in black ) with respect to the mean field value .",
    "inspection of the figure clearly shows that the master copy and mutant species are spatially anti - correlated . in the case of @xmath91 , the fluctuations range in the order of @xmath111 about the mean field value @xmath63 .",

    "deriving the langevin equation description from the master equation provides a quick analytic survey of the global system dynamics ( stationary states , etc ) , as well as the strength and characteristics of the internal noise and its dependence on the spatial dimensionality . for any dimension",
    ", the system can be solved numerically with high accuracy .",
    "this is in contrast to the direct monte carlo simulation of the system , such as in [ 16 ] , where no preliminary analytic information can be given on the effects of reaction noise or dimensionality dependence .",
    "we have shown that the local deviations with respect to the mean - field solution scale with the number of particles and the ratio between the reaction and diffusion processes .",
    "the fluctuations vanish only in the perfectly mixed limit , when the diffusion processes are infinitely fast ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "thus , even in the case of very high diffusion rates , an autocatalytic system can show important deviations with respect to the perfect mixing limit , provided that the number of particles in the reactor system is sufficiently high . for systems with a higher degree of non - linearity ( i.e. , third - order )",
    ", these deviations may eventually lead the system to new asymptotic states and also induce the formation of spatial patterns @xcite . regarding the error catastrophe , this concept differs from virology to molecular replicator dynamics . in the former , the error catastrophe implies the proliferation of lethal mutations with the subsequent loss of viral infectivity , and consequently , the extinction of the viral population .",
    "this is reflected in our model as the trivial solution ( i ) .",
    "on the other hand , solution ( ii ) corresponds to the error catastrophe state predicted by molecular replicator dynamics where there is no wild type population , while there is an error tail .",
    "we have found that this solution is an absorbing barrier .",
    "finally , spatial diffusion and internal noise must in fact play an important role in the correct description of viral infection dynamics , where typically , bottlenecks of different intensities may lead to infection of host cells by limited numbers of viral particles @xcite .",
