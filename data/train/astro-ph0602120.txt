    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are short - period , semi - detached binary systems consisting of an accreting white dwarf ( wd ) primary star and a low - mass main - sequence secondary star as the roche lobe - filling mass donor @xcite .",
    "the binary orbital period in these systems ranges from about @xmath8h to a few days .",
    "however , there is a gap in orbital period between 2 and 3 hours where almost no systems are found .",
    "it is not known whether the systems are evolving from a longer period to a shorter period ( across the gap ) or whether the systems above the gap are all together different from the systems below the gap .",
    "dwarf novae ( dn ) are a subset of cvs that undergo regular eruptions called outbursts which last for days to weeks , separated by intervals of quiescence lasting weeks to months .",
    "the now widely accepted interpretation of the quiescence / outburst cycle is that of the disk instability model ( dim , @xcite ) .",
    "it is assumed that during the quiescent phase the matter in the disk is cold and neutral and the disk is optically thin because of its low density , while during outburst , as the mass accretion rate increases , the matter in the disk is ionized and becomes optically thick .",
    "the basic principle of the dim theory depends heavily on the unknown viscosity parameter @xmath9 and on the mass accretion rate during the different phases .",
    "the mass accretion rate is usually taken from @xcite , which is however only a first order estimate . in the last decade",
    ", the mass accretion rate of many systems has been deduced more accurately at given epochs of outburst or quiescence using spectral fitting techniques .",
    "the accretion rate is usually a function of time ( especially during the outburst itself ) and consequently it is difficult to assess its time - averaged value accurately .",
    "recent advances in theory @xcite have shown that the average mass accretion rate of an accreting wd in dne can be deduced if one knows the mass of the accreting wd and its effective surface temperature during quiescence , therefore providing an additional and independent way to assess @xmath10 .",
    "consequently , in order to put more constraints on the theories we need to known the properties ( mainly the temperature and mass of the wd ) of these systems above as well as below the period gap .",
    "there is , however , a critical shortage in knowledge of the wd properties ( effective temperature @xmath7 , gravity @xmath11 , rotational velocity @xmath12 , chemical abundances , accretion belts ? ) in dwarf novae above the period gap .",
    "thus , detailed comparisons of accreting wds above and below the gap can not be made .    for systems below the gap , with orbital periods near the period minimum",
    ", the distribution of temperatures are centered at @xmath1315,000k with only a narrow range seen at present .",
    "this distribution appears to manifest the effect of long term compressional heating at a time averaged accretion rate of @xmath14yr@xmath6 ( townsley and bildsten 2002 ; sion et al .",
    "it appears that wd @xmath7 s for systems above the gap are higher than wd temperatures in systems below the gap , due to the systems above the gap having larger disks ( with higher mass transfer rates ) and more massive secondaries .",
    "some disks may remain optically thick even during quiescence so that the wds are heated to a greater extent than systems below the gap .",
    "it is not yet known whether the wds in systems above the gap are rotating more slowly than wds in systems below the gap where presumably the cvs are older with a longer history of angular momentum transfer via disk accretion . thus far",
    "the only dwarf novae above the gap whose white dwarfs and disks / boundary layers have been analyzed with _",
    "fuse _ , _ iue _ and",
    "_ hst _ have been z cam @xcite , rx and @xcite , u gem @xcite , ss aur @xcite , ey cyg @xcite , and ru peg @xcite ; a total of 2 z cam systems and 4 u gem systems .",
    "ww ceti is a system above the gap whose classification is uncertain .",
    "although classified as a u geminorum - type system , others suggest a z camelopardis classification .",
    "z cam systems are characterized by prolonged states of intermediate brightness between quiescence and outburst called standstills .",
    "others propose that ww ceti forms a link between z cam and vy sculptoris nova - like variables @xcite .",
    "the latter are systems that drop unpredictably into very low brightness states but spend most of their time in outburst . without conclusive evidence of standstills",
    "however , we will tentatively classify ww ceti as a u gem - type dn .    in this paper , we report an analysis of international ultraviolet explorer ( _ iue _ ) archival spectra and far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( _ fuse _ ) spectra of the dwarf nova ww ceti during quiescence .",
    "our analysis utilizes newly available accretion disk models , photosphere models , and models combining white dwarfs and accretion disks and accretion belts .",
    "the accretion disk models are taken from the grid of models of @xcite , which were recently updated using the lastest version of the stellar / accretion disk synthetic spectral codes ( see section 3 ) .",
    "our objectives are to identify the source(s ) of the fuv radiation during quiescence , derive the properties of the wd ( if detected ) and the quiescent accretion disk , and characterize the hot components in the system .      in table 1",
    "we list the system parameters we have adopted : ( 1 ) cv subtype , ( 2 ) orbital period in days , ( 3 ) orbital inclination in degrees , ( 4 ) spectral type of the secondary , ( 5 ) mass of the primary in solar masses , ( 6 ) mass of the secondary in solar masses , ( 7 ) apparent magnitude in outburst , and ( 8) apparent magnitude in quiescence .",
    "the references are listed below the table .",
    "the orbital period ( 4.22 hours ) is well above the period gap , where few wd properties are currently known .",
    "systems above the gap tend to have somewhat earlier - type secondaries , higher accretion rates , and larger accretion disks .",
    "dwarf novae , unlike other cvs , offer a fairly reliable estimate of their distances via the absolute magnitude at maximum versus orbital period relation for dwarf novae found by @xcite .",
    "this relationship is consistent with theory @xcite .",
    "for ww ceti , this relation yields a distance of 186 pc .",
    "this is midrange of @xmath15 pc as derived by @xcite using near - infrared ccd spectra of the cool companion , slightly higher than the estimate of 130 pc @xcite and close to the range of @xmath16 pc using k magnitudes @xcite . to remain consistent with the parameters used in @xcite , we adopted 186 pc as the distance to ww ceti .",
    "_ fuse _ is a low - earth orbit satellite , launched in june 1999 .",
    "its optical system consists of four optical telescopes ( mirrors ) , each separately connected to a different rowland spectrograph .",
    "the four diffraction gratings of the four rowland spectrographs produce four independent spectra on two photon counting area detectors .",
    "two mirrors and two gratings are coated with sic to provide wavelength coverage below 1020  , while the other two mirrors and gratings are coated with al and lif overcoat .",
    "the al+lif coating provides about twice the reflectivity of sic at wavelengths @xmath171050  , and very little reflectivity below 1020 (hereafter the sic1 , sic2 , lif1 and lif2 channels ) .",
    "a time tag _ fuse _ spectrum ( d1450401 ) of ww ceti was obtained starting on 2003 , july 26 , 05:30:03 with a total raw exposure time of 16,291s ( 9 individual spacecraft orbits ) through the 30``x30 '' lwrs large square aperture .",
    "the spectrum was centered at 1059.73 . from the _ aavso _ ( american association of variable stars observers ) data , we found that the system was in optical quiescence ( @xmath18 for at least 10 days ) preceding and during the observation , and 25 days after an outburst ( @xmath19 ) and about 15 days after a single data point brightness peak ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the data were processed with calfuse version 2.4 totaling 14,817s of good exposure time . in this version ,",
    "event bursts are automatically taken care of .",
    "event bursts are short periods during an exposure when high count rates are registered on one of more detectors .",
    "the bursts exhibit a complex pattern on the detector , their cause , however , is yet unknown ( it has been confirmed that they are not detector effects ) .",
    "ww cet , with a flux of a few @xmath21ergs@xmath5s@xmath6@xmath22@xmath6 , is actually a relatively weak source .",
    "we used the same procedure as in our previous _ fuse _ analysis ( e.g. ru peg & ss aur , @xcite ) to process the _ fuse _ data .    during",
    ", the observations , fine error sensor a , which images the lif1 aperture was used to guide the telescope .",
    "the spectral regions covered by the spectral channels overlap , and these overlap regions are then used to renormalize the spectra in the sic1 , lif2 , and sic2 channels to the flux in the lif1 channel .",
    "we then produced a final spectrum that covers almost the full _ fuse _ wavelength range @xmath23  .",
    "the low sensitivity portions of each channel were discarded . in most channels there",
    "exists a narrow dark stripe of decreased flux in the spectra running in the dispersion direction .",
    "this stripe has been affectionately known as the `` worm '' and it can attenuates as much as 50% of the incident light in the affected portions of the spectrum .",
    "the `` worm '' has been observed to move as much as 2000 pixels during a single orbit in which the target was stationary .",
    "the `` worm '' appears to be present in every exposure and , at this time , there is no explanation for it . because of the temporal changes in the strength and position of the `` worm '' , calfuse can not correct target fluxes for its presence .",
    "here we took particular care to discard the portion of the spectrum where the so - called _ worm _ crawls. the lif1 channel was affected by the worm longward of @xmath24   . because of this the @xmath25   region was lost , as it is covered only by the lif1 channel .",
    "we combined the individual exposures and channels to create a time - averaged spectrum with a linear , @xmath26   dispersion , weighting the flux in each output datum by the exposure time and sensitivity of the input exposure and channel of origin .",
    "the _ fuse _ spectrum of ww cet ( see figure 1 ) in the longer wavelengths ( @xmath27 ) is very similar to the _ fuse _ spectra of dne in quiescence in which the wd is exposed . here , that portion of the spectrum reveals the familiar absorption features of c ( around 1175 ) and si ( around 1110 , 1140 - 1145 , and 1160 )",
    "however , at shorter wavelengths ( @xmath28 ) there are very broad emission lines that are usually found in nova - like systems ( e.g. such as ae aqr , v347 pup , dw uma , see the mast _ fuse _ archives ) and are not usually present in low - inclination dn systems in quiescence .",
    "the most prominent emission feature is the o doublet with laboratory wavelengths 1031.9261  & 1037.6167 .",
    "the feature is best fitted with a double gaussian shifted by @xmath29(see figure 2 , upper panel ) .",
    "a double gaussian at the rest frame ( figure 2 , lower panel ) does not fit the data as well and a single gaussian disagrees even more with the o emission feature . on top of the o doublet is a a c interstellar absorption at the expected rest - frame wavelength 1036.3 .",
    "the c ( 977.02 ) broad emission line seems also to have a c interstellar absorption superposed to it .",
    "the two n and the si emission lines ( between 980  and 1000 ) are also marked , but they are contaminated with some air glow emission ( o ) and are less prominent than the c and o emission features . for a more complete comparison we have also marked the positions of the n emission lines about 925  , which form a broad `` hump '' ( and could possibly also include s ) .",
    "the _ fuse _ spectrum of ww ceti also exhibits some sharper absorption lines , probably of interstellar origin , the most prominent ones are n ( around 1134 ) , n ( around 1084 - 1085 ) , c ( 1036.3 ) and c ( 977 ) .      the _ iue _ archive contains two observations of ww ceti with the short - wavelength prime ( swp ) camera through the large aperture at low dispersion with a resolution of 5 , covering the wavelength range 1170 to 2000 .",
    "the brightness state of the system at the time the _ iue _ spectra were taken was determined by the observed flux levels and _ iue _ fine error sensor visual magnitudes of the system as confirmed by light - curve data from the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) .",
    "one of the spectra , swp24866 , was obtained during quiescence , its observing log is shown in table 2 . in the present work we concentrate only on the quiescent phase of the system .    the _ iue _ newsips spectrum was flux - calibration corrected using the massa - fitzpatrick corrections @xcite .",
    "the spectrum was not corrected for reddening , as e(b - v ) = 0 for ww ceti @xcite .",
    "the _ iue _ spectrum also exhibits some broad emission lines .",
    "the most prominent ones are c ( 1548/50 ) , he ( 1640  balmer @xmath9 ) , o ( 1658 - 1666 ) and the strong feature around 1400   is either due to either o or to si or to both .",
    "the spectrum is very similar to some nl systems ( ip ) . with their broad emission lines , both the _ fuse _ and _ iue _",
    "spectra show evidence of hot gas .",
    "a comparison of the _ iue _ spectrum in quiescence and the _ fuse _ spectrum in the wavelength overlap region reveals that the flux levels match thus enabling us to carry out model fits over a substantially broader wavelength range .",
    "we prepared the combined _ fuse _ and _ iue _ spectra for fitting by masking regions containing emission lines and artifacts .",
    "the following wavelengths were masked : @xmath30 .",
    "these regions of the spectrum were not included in the fitting .",
    "we used model accretion disks from the optically thick disk model grid of @xcite and created model spectra for high - gravity stellar atmospheres using tlusty200 @xcite , synspec48 and rotin4 @xcite . using iuefit , a @xmath31 minimization routine , we computed @xmath32 and scale factor values for each model fit",
    ". @xmath33 is known as the `` reduced '' chi - squared , namely @xmath31 per number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom @xmath34 is the number of bins @xmath35 for which observed data is taken into account when calculating @xmath31 minus the number of freely varying parameters @xmath36 used to calculate the model , namely @xmath37 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "here we take the number of bins in the wavelength axis excluding the masked regions . for the _ iue _ data",
    "binned at 1.68    @xmath38 , for _ fuse _ binned at 0.1   @xmath39 ( and decreases accordingly for binning of 0.2 and 0.5   ) and for the combined _ iue - fuse _ spectrum @xmath40 ( as the _ fuse _ data there are binned at 0.5   ) .",
    "the range of disk model parameters are the following : wd mass ( in solar masses)values of 0.55 , 0.80 , 1.03 , and 1.21 ; orbital inclination @xmath41 ( in degrees ) of 18 , 41 , 60 , 75 , and 81 .",
    "the accretion rate ranges from @xmath42yr@xmath6 to @xmath43yr@xmath6 , varying in increments of 0.5 in @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , for the disk models one has @xmath45 . for the photosphere models , the effective temperature values range from 15,000 k to 35,000k in increments of 1,000k .",
    "we chose values of @xmath11 ranging between 8.0 and 8.6 for consistency with the observed mass .",
    "we also varied the stellar rotational velocity @xmath12 from @xmath46km@xmath5s@xmath6 to @xmath47km@xmath5s@xmath6 in steps of @xmath46km@xmath5s@xmath6 . in order to try and fit the absorption features of the spectrum",
    ", we also vary the chemical abundances of c , n and si . the number of freely varying parameters for the stellar atmosphere models can therefore be as high as @xmath48 . for combined accretion disk and stellar wd atmosphere models ,",
    "the disk flux is divided by 100 to normalize it at 1000pc to match the wd flux , therefore giving explicitly the relative flux contributions of each component .",
    "then both fluxes are added for comparison with the observed flux . for the combined models",
    "this leads to @xmath49 , since for any wd mass there is a corresponding radius , or equivalently one single value of @xmath11 ( e.g. see the mass radius relation from @xcite or see @xcite for different composition and non - zero temperatures wds ) .",
    "while we use a @xmath31 minimization technique , we do not `` blindly '' select the least @xmath31 models , but we examine the models that best fit some of the features such as absorption lines ( see the fit to the _ fuse _ spectrum alone ) and , when possible , the slope of the wings of the broad lyman absorption features .",
    "we also select the models that are in agreement with the known distance of the system .",
    "it is useful to explore the results of analyzing the _ fuse _ and _ iue _ spectra separately versus when they are combined .",
    "we started with the _ iue _ archival spectrum swp24866 , taken in quiescence . applying the grid of disk models to the _ iue _ data ,",
    "the best - fitting disk - only model had a wd mass of @xmath50 , an orbital inclination of 60 degrees , and an accretion rate of @xmath51yr@xmath6 .",
    "this model gave a @xmath32 value of 1.870 and a scale factor of 0.063 , which yielded a distance of 395 pc .",
    "this accretion rate is rather large to be associated with quiescence and the distance from the scale factor is far larger than the adopted distance of 186 pc .",
    "therefore we reject this result .",
    "for single temperature white dwarf models , the best - fitting model photosphere had an effective temperature of 23,000 k , @xmath11= 8.0 , giving a @xmath33 value of 2.97 and a scale factor of 0.004717 , which yielded a distance of 199 pc .",
    "this distance is in excellent agreement with our adopted distance .",
    "this result suggests that a white dwarf with a t@xmath52k could alone account for the fuv flux without an accretion disk .",
    "we first tried an accretion disk alone , but the fit was extremely poor .",
    "we then tried to fit the _ fuse _ spectrum with a wd alone synthetic spectrum .",
    "the best fit model was a @xmath53k wd , with @xmath54 , a rotation rate of @xmath55km@xmath5s@xmath6 , a distance of 212pc and @xmath56 .",
    "the abundance were c=0.1 x solar , n=2 x solar and si=0.3 x solar .",
    "a solar abundances model had a @xmath57 , not statistically different from the non - solar model , however some of the features of the observed _ fuse _ spectrum were better fitted with non - solar abundances .",
    "the results are presented in figure 3 .    in particular , fitting the following features were the main reason for adopting the non - solar abundances model as the best fit .",
    "+ ( i ) in the solar abundances model there is a broad absorption feature around 1065 which is not present in the observed _ fuse _ spectrum .",
    "when decreasing c this absorption feature disappeared and we obtained a better fit .",
    "this absorption feature is due to + c 1063.28 , 1063.31 , 1065.89 , 1065.92 , 1066.13   .",
    "+ ( ii ) there is a deep absorption feature in the _ fuse _ data around 1084 - 1085 a , although this might be due to interstellar absorption we found that increasing n by a factor 2 solar gives a better fit .",
    "this absorption feature is due to + n 1083.99 , 1084.56 , 1084.58 , 1085.53 , 1085.55 , 1085.70   . + ( iii ) around 1108 - 1114 , 1123 , 1128 , 1140 - 1146 and around 1160 ",
    "there are many absorption features which can be matched only by decreasing c and si abundances .",
    "these are : + si : 1108.36 , 1109.94 , 1113.17 , 1113.20 , 1113.23    + blend : c 1125.6 + c 1127 .",
    "+ si 1128.3   +",
    "c + blend : c+c+c 1138 - 1141    + blend : si 1140.5 - 1145.7   .",
    "+ while it is obvious that there must be some c broad emission around 1175  there is also absorption present . since we do not know a priori how much emission and absorption there is , we can not model this region .",
    "decreasing c and si further than 0.1 and 0.3 ( respectively ) led to improvement of the fit in some parts of the spectrum but the fit also deteriorated in other regions .",
    "it is also important to note that the depth of the broad absorption features which actually form part of the continuum ( e.g. as for si ) depends not only on the abundances but also on the rotational velocity . increasing the rotational velocity has the same effect as reducing the abundances , as the depth of the absorption features decreases .",
    "overall , the c ( around 1065   ) , the si ( around 1110   ) and the si - c blend ( in the range 1138 - 1146   ) were the main absorption features that drove both the si and the c to sub - solar values .",
    "as these abundances were reduced , the fit of the theoretical spectrum also slightly improved in other regions ( such as around 1055   and 1080   ) .",
    "we feel confident that the carbon and silicon wd photospheric abundances are actually well represented by the non - solar best fit models , as these were derived from fitting these regions of the spectrum that were not contaminated by broad emission features and/or sharp interstellar absorption features . for nitrogen ,",
    "the results are inconclusive as the nitrogen features were contaminated by sharp absorptions possibly originating from the ism or from the immediate surroundings of the system .    in figure 4",
    "we show the residual emission , namely , we subtracted the theoretical spectrum from the observed one .",
    "the apparent emission features in the residual spectrum are the o doublet ( with an interstellar c absorption ) , the two c lines ( 977   and 1175   ) and possibly also n , n , n and si as marked in figure 4 .",
    "such emission features are often seen in the _ fuse _ spectra of ip systems or other dne systems and it implies that gas is possibly being heated by shock ( e.g. accretion column in magnetic systems ) .    from these fits , it is evident that a wd alone is not enough to reproduce all the features of the spectrum .",
    "the bottom of ly@xmath58 does not go to zero and indicates the presence of an additional component , which may or may not be linked to the broad emission features . while it is clear that the longward wing of the ly@xmath58 can not go to zero because of o emission , the shortward wing reaches @xmath59erg@xmath5s@xmath6@xmath22 @xmath6 .",
    "we tried a combination of a wd plus an accretion disk and , as in the case of the _ iue _ spectrum , we found that the best fit model had a distance about twice as large as the adopted distance of 186pc .",
    "therefore , we tried a combination of a hot , fast rotating belt with a wd .",
    "the best combined ( wd+belt ) model consisted of a wd with a temperature of 25,000k , rotating at 600km@xmath5s@xmath6 , with @xmath54 , and with the following abundances : carbon 0.1 x solar , nitrogen 2 x solar and silicon 0.5 x solar .",
    "the second component had a temperature of 40,000k , rotating at 3,000km@xmath5s@xmath6 and had an emitting area of 3 percent of the total wd surface .",
    "the wd contributes 75% of the flux integrated over the _ fuse _ wavelength range , while the second component contributes the remaining 25% .",
    "the @xmath33 value was 1.38 with a distance of 190pc .",
    "this best fit is shown in figure 5 .",
    "we combined the _",
    "fuse _ and _ iue _ quiescent spectra of ww ceti and first tried single - temperature white dwarf models to the combined spectra .",
    "the best - fitting model for @xmath60 yielded the following parameters : @xmath61 , d=189pc , t@xmath62k , @xmath63 km@xmath5s@xmath6 , and abundances : carbon 0.1 x solar , nitrogen 2 x solar and silicon 0.5 x solar . the white dwarf rotation ( @xmath64 ) rate was determined from fitting the wd model to the spectrum while paying careful attention to the line profiles in the _ fuse _ portion of the combined spectrum .",
    "namely , we did not carry out separate fits to individual lines but rather tried to fit the lines and continuum in the same fit .",
    "the best - fitting single temperature wd fit to the combined _ fuse _ plus _ iue _ spectrum is displayed in figure 6 .",
    "second , we tried models of optically thick accretion disks alone .",
    "since the previous individual disk fits to the _ fuse _ and _ iue _ spectra alone were very poor , we did not expect the disk fit to the combined spectrum to be better .",
    "for this exercise , we fixed the disk inclination at the value published for ww ceti .",
    "we also fixed the white dwarf mass at 0.8 m@xmath65 for consistency and easier comparison with the white dwarf - only model results .",
    "for m@xmath66 , and @xmath67 degrees , the best - fitting accretion disk models had a mass accretion rate in the range @xmath68/yr , leading to a distance of @xmath69pc respectively .",
    "again the fit was very poor and the distance was not in agreement with our adopted value of 186pc .",
    "next , we tried combination fits of a white dwarf and accretion disk .",
    "we follow the same procedure as described in the previous paragraph , namely we fix the wd mass to @xmath70 and the inclination to 60 degrees and we vary the mass accretion rate .",
    "we then varied the wd temperature for each given mass accretion rate until we achieved a best - fit .",
    "the best fit of all was achieved when the wd temperature was t@xmath71k and the accretion rate was @xmath72/yr .",
    "the @xmath32 for this fit was 3.41 .",
    "the white dwarf contributes only 25% of the flux and the disk contributes 75% ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "however , the distance obtained was far too large ( d@xmath13460 pc ) and the mass accretion rate rather large for quiescence .",
    "therefore , again , we rejected this result .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the fit is better in the _ iue _ range than in the _ fuse _ range , where the model flux is basically 20 % too low .    finally , we compared the results of the above fitting attempts with a two - temperature wd model fit .",
    "a wd is expected to show a temperature variation with latitude if accretion occurs preferentially at the equator from a disk or if a wd is magnetic and accretes preferentially at magnetic poles . in the former case",
    ", we envision the possibility of a hot accretion belt , or hot inner disk ring .",
    "we ran a series of models in which a wd is cooler and rotates more slowly at higher latitudes and has a fast spinning ( near keplerian speed ) hot atmosphere belt .",
    "we tried a range of combinations of cooler wd and belts of different temperatures and lower gravity . for the wd we kept @xmath54 constant and searched for a best fit consistent with a distance of @xmath73pc",
    "the white dwarf plus accretion belt combination which yielded the best fit has a wd with t@xmath74k , and an accretion belt with t@xmath75k , @xmath76 with solar abundances .",
    "the cooler portion of the wd contributes 75% of the fuv flux while the accretion belt contributes 25% of the fuv flux .",
    "this is the same best fit combined model as the one for the _ fuse _ spectrum alone .",
    "the @xmath32 value was 3.56 and the scale parameter led to a distance of 190pc .",
    "our comparison of the two - temperature ( wd + accretion belt ) model is displayed in figure 8 .",
    "the improvement of model fits that result from two - temperature wds has been reported elsewhere for a number of other systems ( e.g. szkody et al .",
    "2003 ; sion et al .",
    "during the quiescence of ww ceti , our fits to the combined _ fuse _ + _ iue _ fluxes reveal that a single - temperature with @xmath77k can account for the flux .",
    "the white dwarf appears to have a rotational velocity of @xmath55 km@xmath5s@xmath6 .",
    "the error bars are chosen here to be the size of the increments by which the parameters are varied . for ww cet , which is actually a rather weak source for _ fuse _ and _ iue _ , these error bars are consistent with the modelings , i.e. smaller error bars / increments do not lead to a significant improvement in the fit . the best agreement with the observations",
    "is provided by a two - temperature white dwarf model with a cooler white dwarf at @xmath2k providing 75% of the fuv flux and a hotter region ( accretion belt or optically thick disk ring ) with t = 40,000k contributing 25% of the flux .",
    "the fitting of the shape of the absorption lines in the _ fuse _ range led to the following best fit abundances : carbon 0.1 x solar , nitrogen 2 x solar , and silicon 0.3 - 0.5 x solar . in all the fitting models of the combined ( _ fuse_+_iue _ ) data we have kept the mass of the wd constant ( @xmath78 corresponding to @xmath54 ) and rejected models in disagreement with a distance of @xmath79pc .",
    "an important point is the significance of the two - temperature wd fit over the single wd fit .",
    "a change in chi - squared from 1.58 to 1.38 ( for the _ fuse _ fits ) and , even more so , from 3.73 to 3.56 ( for the _ fuse+iue _ fits ) is at best a modest improvement in the fit quality with the addition of the second temperature component .",
    "however , adding the second component results in a better fit to the bottom of the ly@xmath58 line around 1025  , and improves the fit to the left wing of ly@xmath80 ( the right wing is contaminated by the ovi emission feature )",
    ". in that region the improvement of the fit is the actual fitting of the blue wing of the ly@xmath58 in the spectrum .",
    "we remark here that there could be some instrument background contamination contributing to the flux , such that the ly@xmath58 would actually never go to zero .",
    "however , since we have discarded all the noisy portions of the channels ( usually the edges ) , the actual contribution of the instrument contamination should be less than @xmath81erg@xmath5s@xmath6@xmath22@xmath6 ( @xmath8250% of the flux ) which is the excess emission at 910 ( this is an overestimate , since the region @xmath83   is near the edge where the noise is maximal ) .    in the wavelength range @xmath84970   the improvement of the fit does not fit any actual feature but only reduces the discrepancy between the model and the observation . therefore",
    "the need and importance of the second component does not originate from fitting that part of the spectrum where there is emission but rather it comes from fitting a feature in the continuum . at this stage",
    "the `` belt '' is really a flat continuum added to improve the fit and it should be regarded as a featureless blue spectrum . so far the belt is probably not the best physical description of the data but it is the best available model component to help improve the fit .",
    "in fact , the two - temperature wd fit does not provide the lowest @xmath33 , the disk+wd does .",
    "however , this lowest disk+wd model , while fitting better in the _ iue _ ( lower resolution ) spectral range , does not provide a good fit a in the _ fuse _ ( higher resolution ) range of the combined spectrum and is inconsistant with the distance of the system .",
    "as we stated previously , we do not chose blindly the lowest @xmath33 model , but we chose one of the lowest @xmath33 models that provides a better fit to some specific parts and features of the spectrum . the fact that both the wd+belt and the wd+disk provide the lowest @xmath33 models , reflects the fact that the second component can not , presently , be modeled accurately .",
    "there are broad emission lines which are probably due to a hot gas , and the o red - shifted feature may indicate the possibility that the material is flowing away from the observer .",
    "however , the other emission features are not resolved enough to confirm or refute such a scenario .",
    "we do not discuss here the origin or the possible scenarios of such a flow , though the mechanisms at work could be as varied as the ones discussed in @xcite on the fuv observation of the complex system dw uma .",
    "it might be worth noting that the supra - solar nitrogen abundance , albeit uncertain ( as it could well be from interstellar origin ) , together with the sub - solar carbon abundance , could be a result of cno - processing , either from a past nova or from cno processed material being transferred from the processed core of the secondary .",
    "finally , our fitting results provide an additional badly needed temperature data point in the distribution of wd @xmath7 versus orbital period above the cv period gap where few wd @xmath7s are available , and an additional white dwarf rotational velocity derived from the _ fuse _ data alone ( see table 3 ) .",
    "the surface temperature and rotational velocity of the white dwarf in ww ceti are within the range that has been derived for the handful of other dwarf nova white dwarfs above the period gap .",
    "the effective temperature , @xmath85k @xmath1k , of the white dwarf lies at the lower boundary of the temperature distribution for dwarf nova white dwarfs above the period gap .",
    "for example , at the high temperature end are ru peg ( @xmath7 = 53,000k , @xcite ) and z cam ( @xmath7 = 57,000k ; @xcite ) while ss aur ( @xmath7 = 27,000k ; @xcite ) , u gem ( @xmath7 = 30,000k ; @xcite ) and rx and ( @xmath7 = 34,000k ; @xcite ) make up the remainder of the distribution .",
    "the rotation rate of @xmath55km@xmath5s@xmath6 is at the high end of the rotation rate distribution for cv white dwarfs above and below the gap @xcite .",
