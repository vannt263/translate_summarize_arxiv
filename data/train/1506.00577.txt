    "the random cluster model was first introduced by kasteleyn and fortuin  @xcite , and by coninglio and klein  @xcite for lattice systems .",
    "swendsen and wang  @xcite developed the cluster algorithm based on the physics of this model and were able to implement an algorithm using the widom - rowlinson and stillinger - helfand models for fluid mixtures  @xcite , an example that numerical simulation methods first developed for lattice systems can also be extended to off - lattice systems .",
    "hller and pleimling  @xcite have developed a successful cluster algorithm to study the ising model in two and three dimensions within the microcanonical ensemble based upon the broad histogram method ( bhm )  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm works very well because in the ising model the energy and magnetization have discretized values .",
    "the hller - pleimling method ( hpm ) has two important advantages compared with the method proposed by creutz ( cm )  @xcite : first , in a single run a wide range of energies can be covered , instead of a fixed one as in cm .",
    "second , the heat capacity can be obtained with a numerical derivative , whereas for cm it is necessary to calculate the fluctuations in the fourier transform of the energy . in the cm approach , however , no floating - point operations are required and no random numbers are needed at all if sequential updating is used .    in terms of efficiency",
    "the hpm approach compares very well with the method proposed by wang and landau ( wlm )  @xcite , that covers a wide range of temperatures too .",
    "for example , for the @xmath0 ising model , the average errors for the energy are @xmath1 and @xmath2 for hpm and wlm , respectively , considering the same number of monte carlo updates ( @xmath3 , see reference  @xcite ) .",
    "the first successful attempt to extend bmh to continuous systems was made by muoz and herrmann  @xcite . in this work",
    "we use hpm to study simple fluids , taking advantage that in this method the entropy is evaluated as a function of the energy . the extension presented here",
    "can be applied to discrete - potential ( dp ) systems , that also have a discrete set of energy values as in the ising model .",
    "the sw potential is a very simple dp system after the hard - sphere potential , whose structural and thermodynamic quantities have been very well characterized along the years  @xcite .",
    "the sw system has been extensively applied within different statistical mechanics approaches  @xcite , since is usually easier to implement than other pair potentials in statistical - mechanics theories , as the discrete potential and multipolar discrete perturbation theories  @xcite , as well as the statistical associating fluid theory for chain molecules with attractive potentials of variable range ( saft - vr )  @xcite . these and other theories have made possible to describe phase diagrams of real complex fluids .",
    "the sw potential is a radial potential defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the separation distance between the centers of two particles ; @xmath6 represents the particle s hard - core diameter ; @xmath7 is the potential range of an attractive interaction of depth -@xmath8 .    in section",
    "ii the method proposed in this work is described in detail , and its application to sw systems is presented in section iii . among the thermodynamic quantities that can be calculated , we focus our attention on the internal energy and the isochoric heat capacity , since these quantities are more sensitive when perturbation theories are used . as we shall see in this section , both properties",
    "are predicted very accurately with microcanonical simulations when compared with mc - nvt data .",
    "finally , in section iv the main conclusions of this work are given .",
    "in order to describe the methodology we consider a system of @xmath9 particles confined within a volume @xmath10 . the available energy levels will be labeled as @xmath11 , defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the distance between the centers of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 particles and @xmath16 is the number of pair of particles that satisfies @xmath17 .",
    "we denote by @xmath18 the number of configurations , or microstates , that share the same energy @xmath11 .",
    "a new microstate is generated when a given mechanism is applied to a previous microstate ; for a fluid composed of spherical particles the mechanism that has to be considered is a displacement of a particle , @xmath19 .",
    "when @xmath19 is applied to all @xmath9 particles for each @xmath18 microstates , then @xmath20 new microstates are created , but only a small number will have energy @xmath21 , that will be denoted as @xmath22 ; in order to satisfy the reversibility condition , it is required that @xmath23 , a relation that holds for both continuous and discontinuous systems , since the bhm method is an exact theory ( see reference  @xcite ) .",
    "the set of movements counted applying bhm is different to those followed to construct the sequence of visited , averaged states , that guarantee equiprobability .",
    "consequently , it is necessary to consider two different protocols of allowed movements , depending on the reversibility or equiprobability conditions to be satisfied .",
    "then , if a random selection is done of one of the @xmath18 microstates with energy @xmath11 and a new microstate is generated by applying a displacement @xmath24 to a random particle , then the probability that the system has a new energy @xmath21 is given by @xmath25 similarly , @xmath26 both probabilities can be obtained calculating the rate of attempts @xmath27 to go from level @xmath11 to level @xmath21 . in order to do this , two variables are required :    * the number of times that the system spend in level @xmath11 , denoted by @xmath28 . *",
    "the number of times that the system attempts to go from level @xmath11 to level @xmath21 , denoted by @xmath29 .",
    "variables @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be evaluated according to the following steps :    1 .   with @xmath11 as the initial state , a particle at random is chosen and @xmath28 is then redefined as @xmath30 .",
    "the new energy @xmath21 is evaluated considering that a random displacement is applied to the previously chosen particle .",
    "if @xmath21 is an allowed energy level , then @xmath29 is updated as @xmath31 , independently of the particle s displacement being accepted or not .",
    "the only possible restriction is the value of the fixed energy chosen to work with , _",
    "i.e. _ all cases where @xmath32 or @xmath33 are discarded .",
    "the probability of an accepted displacement is 1 if @xmath34 , otherwise is @xmath35 .",
    "the last condition assures that all levels are able to be visited with equal probability , independently of their degeneracy .",
    "the initial values for @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be any positive number and after a large number of particle s displacement attempts it is observed that @xmath36 and the required ratios are given by @xmath37 this algorithm is highly efficient to obtain the ratios @xmath38 ( or the entropy differences @xmath39 , according to boltzmann s relation @xmath40}$ ] ) , since the number of times that the random number generator is used is smaller than those required in mc - nvt simulations .",
    "the efficiency of the method increases if the number of allowed levels @xmath41 is decreased .    since the inverse temperature @xmath42 is obtained from the entropy by deriving it with respect to the energy , @xmath43 then it is convenient to express the entropy as a series expansion in @xmath44 , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is an integer such that @xmath47 .",
    "the rest of the terms in the expansion can be discarded as long as @xmath9 is large enough , obtaining @xmath48 this equation can be used to obtain the inverse temperature as a function of the internal energy .    in the ising model",
    "the energy changes are well defined since they depend on the number of nearest neighbors in each lattice site and this number is fixed , and the hpm algorithm can be applied straightforwardly . in the next section",
    "we will explain how this method can also be valid for the case of a sw fluid .",
    "we consider sw systems with attractive ranges @xmath7= 1.1 , 1.3 and 1.5 , that are typical values required to describe molecular and complex fluids .",
    "previous to any calculation we must establish the allowed values of @xmath46 for the sw potential . in the original work by hller and pleimling",
    "this is not necessary since for the ising model the energy changes are well defined and depend on the number of nearest neighbors , which is a fixed quantity . for the sw fluid case , however , different jumps of energy ( i.e. , different @xmath46 values ) will occur , with different frequencies among them .",
    "nevertheless , the values of @xmath46 can be chosen by considering the more frequent energy jumps performed by the system .",
    "this can be achieved using a simple nvt monte carlo simulation for several values of density and @xmath7 in the limit of infinity temperature , a limit in which all energy changes are accepted .",
    "then histograms can be obtained considering the relative frequency of the energy changes , as presented in figure [ histograma ] for three different densities of the sw fluid with @xmath49 .",
    "histograms for the energy displacements @xmath50 for the sw fluid with attractive range @xmath49 and densities @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , from top to bottom .",

    ", it is necessary to evaluate proper values for @xmath46 each time that a sw system is simulated using hpm .",
    "once that @xmath46 values have been obtained , the inverse temperatures are given by @xmath58 furthermore , from the curves @xmath59 the isochoric heat capacity @xmath60 can also be obtained performing a second derivative , @xmath61 ^ 2}{s''(e)}.\\ ] ]    in order to illustrate this method , computer simulations for the sw fluid were performed using a unitary box with periodic boundary conditions , considering @xmath62 particles and reduced densities @xmath63 between @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in all the cases ,",
