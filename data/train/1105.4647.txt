    "the  mission has recently made public a catalog of all transiting planet candidates identified during the first four months of observation by the spacecraft @xcite . included in this list of 1235 objects",
    "are nearly 300 in the category of super - earths ( defined here as having radii in the range @xmath5 ) , and several dozen of earth size ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the wealth of new information promises to revolutionize our knowledge of extrasolar planets .",
    "although strictly speaking these are still only _ candidates _ since confirmation by spectroscopic or other means is not yet in hand , expectations are high that the rate of false positives in this list is relatively small ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , results from this sample concerning the general properties of exoplanets have already begun to emerge , including studies of the architecture and dynamics of multiple transiting systems @xcite , an investigation of the statistical distribution of eccentricities @xcite , and first estimates of the rate of occurrence of planets larger than 2@xmath7 with orbital periods up to 50 days @xcite , among others .    for good reasons the confirmation or `` validation '' of small transiting planets ( earth - size or super - earth - size )",
    "has attracted considerable attention , but has proven to be non - trivial in many cases because of the difficulty of detecting the tiny radial - velocity ( rv ) signatures that these objects cause on their parent stars , as exemplified by the cases of corot-7b @xcite , kepler-9d @xcite , and kepler-11 g @xcite .",
    "in fact , such spectroscopic signals are often too small to detect with current instrumentation , and the planetary nature of the candidate must be established statistically , as in the latter two cases .",
    "the smallest planet discovered to date , kepler-10b , was announced recently by @xcite , and is the  mission s first rocky planet .",
    "it has a measured radius of @xmath8 and a mass of @xmath9 , leading to a mean density of @xmath10 that implies a significant iron mass fraction @xcite .",
    "its parent star , kepler-10 ( kic11904151 , 2mass119024305 + 5014286 ) , is relatively bright among the  targets (  magnitude @xmath11 ) and displays _ two _ periodic signals with periods of 0.84 days and 45.3 days , and flux decrements ( ignoring limb darkening ) of @xmath12 ppm and @xmath1 ppm , respectively @xcite . the extensive observations that followed the detection of these signals are documented in detail by those authors , and include the difficult measurement of the reflex radial - velocity motion of the star with a semi - amplitude of only @xmath13  and a period that is consistent with the shorter signal .",
    "as is customary also in ground - based searches for transiting planets , the shapes of the spectral lines were examined carefully to rule out changes of similar amplitude correlating with orbital phase that might indicate a false positive , such as a background eclipsing binary ( eb ) blended with the target , or an eb physically associated with it .",
    "however the precision of the measurements ( bisector spans ) compared to the small rv amplitude did not allow such changes to be ruled out unambiguously .",
    "false positive scenarios were explored with the aid of , a technique that models the transit light curves to test a wide range of blend configurations @xcite , and it was found that the overwhelming majority of them can be rejected .",
    "this and other evidence presented by @xcite allowed the planetary nature of kepler-10b to be established with very high confidence .",
    "this was not the case , however , for the 45-day period signal referred to as koi-072.02  (  object of interest 72.02 ) , which is the subject of this paper .",
    "no significant rv signal was detected at this period , and only an upper limit on its amplitude could be placed .",
    "using , @xcite were able to rule out a large fraction of the blend scenarios involving circular orbits ( including hierarchical triples ) , but eccentric orbits were not explored because of the increased complexity of the problem and the much larger space of parameters for false positives . while circular orbits are a reasonable assumption for kepler-10b because of the strong effects of tidal forces at close range , this is not true for koi-072.02  on account of its much longer orbital period ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) ; eccentric orbits can not be ruled out .",
    "this provides the motivation for the present work , in which we set out to examine all viable astrophysical false positive scenarios for koi-072.02with the goal of validating it as a bona - fide planet .",
    "in addition to improvements in the  modeling , we bring to bear new near - infrared observations obtained with the _ spitzer _",
    "space telescope in which the transits are clearly detected , as well as the complete arsenal of follow - up observations gathered by the  team , including high - resolution adaptive optics imaging and speckle interferometry , high - resolution spectroscopy , and an analysis based on the  observations themselves of the difference images in and out of transit for positional displacements ( centroid motion ) .",
    "all of these observations combined with the strong constraints provided by  significantly limit the kinds of blends that remain possible , and as we describe below they allow us to claim with very high confidence that koi-072.02  is indeed a planet .",
    "its estimated radius is approximately 60% of that of neptune . with this",
    ", kepler-10 becomes the mission s third confirmed multi - planet system ( after kepler-9 and kepler-11 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) containing a transiting super - earth - size planet and at least one larger planet that also transits .",
    "we begin with a brief recapitulation of the  technique , including recent improvements .",
    "we then present the _",
    "warm spitzer_observations at 4.5  that help rule out many blends , and we summarize additional constraints available from other observations .",
    "this is followed by the application of  to koi-072.02  in order to identify all blends scenarios that can mimic the  transit light curve .",
    "next we combine this information with the other constraints and carry out a statistical assessment of the false alarm rate for the planet hypothesis , leading to the validation of the candidate as kepler-10c .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the possible constitution of the new planet in the light of current models , and the significance of this type of validation .",
    "the detailed morphology of a transit light curve ( length of ingress / egress , total duration ) contains important information that can be used to reject many false positive scenarios producing brightness variations that do not quite have the right shape , even though they may well match the observed transit depth ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite takes advantage of this to explore a very large range of scenarios , including background or foreground eclipsing binaries blended with the target , as well as eclipsing binaries physically associated with the target in a hierarchical triple configuration .",
    "following the notation introduced by @xcite , the objects composing the binary are referred to as the `` secondary '' and `` tertiary '' , and the candidate is the `` primary '' .",
    "the tertiary can be either a star ( including a white dwarf ) or a planet , and the secondary can be a main - sequence star or a ( background ) giant .    with the help of model isochrones to set the stellar properties ,  simulates blend light curves resulting from the flux of the eclipsing pair diluted by the brighter target ( and any additional stars that may fall within the photometric aperture ) .",
    "each simulated light curve is compared with the  observations in a @xmath14 sense to identify which of them result in acceptable fits ( to be defined later ) .",
    "the parameters varied during the simulations are the mass of the secondary star ( @xmath15 ) , the mass of the tertiary ( @xmath16 , or its radius @xmath17 if a planet ) , the impact parameter ( @xmath18 ) , the relative linear distance ( @xmath19 ) between the eclipsing pair and the target , and the relative duration ( @xmath20 ) of the transit compared to the duration for a circular orbit ( see below ) . for convenience the relative linear distance",
    "is parametrized in terms of the difference in distance modulus , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 . in the case of hierarchical triple configurations",
    "the isochrone for the binary is assumed to be the same as for the primary ( metallicity of @xmath23 } = -0.15 $ ] and a nominal age of 11.9gyr ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas for background blends we have adopted for the binary a representative 3gyr isochrone of solar metallicity , although these parameters have a minimal impact on the results . for full details of the technique",
    "we refer the reader to the references above .",
    "three recent changes and improvements that are especially relevant to the application to koi-072.02  are described next :    ( _ i _ ) the relatively long orbital period of koi-072.02  ( 45.3 days ) precludes us from assuming that the eccentricity ( @xmath24 ) is zero , as we were able to suppose in previous applications of  to kepler-9d and kepler-10b , which have periods of 1.59 and 0.84 days , respectively .",
    "the reason this matters is that the duration of the transit is set , among other factors , by the size of the secondary star .",
    "eccentricity can alter the speed of the tertiary around the secondary , making it slower or faster than in the circular case depending on the orientation of the orbit ( longitude of periastron , @xmath25 ) .",
    "given a fixed ( measured ) duration , blends with smaller or larger secondary stars than in the circular case may still provide satisfactory fits to the light curve , effectively increasing the pool of potential false positives .",
    "now takes this into account , although rather than using as parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which are the natural variables employed in the binary light - curve generating routine at the core of ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a more convenient variable that captures the effects of both is the duration relative to a circular orbit .",
    "following @xcite , this may be expressed as @xmath26 .",
    "operationally , then , we vary @xmath20 over wide ranges as we explore different blend scenarios , and for each value we infer the corresponding values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in practice , in order to solve for \\{@xmath24 , @xmath25 } from @xmath20 it is only necessary to consider the limiting cases with @xmath27 and 270 , corresponding to transits occurring at periastron and apastron , respectively , since these are the orientations resulting in the minimum and maximum durations for a given eccentricity",
    ". other combinations of @xmath24 and @xmath25 will lead to intermediate relative durations that are already sampled in our @xmath20 grid .",
    "it is worth noting that use of only these two values of @xmath25 leads to predicted secondary eclipses in the simulated light curves that are always located at phase 0.5 , whereas secondary eclipses in the real data might be present at any phase . for our purposes",
    "this is of no consequence , as koi-072.02  has already had its light curve screened for secondary eclipses at any phase that might betray a false positive , as part of the vetting process .",
    "no such features are present down to the 100  ppm level .",
    "thus , any simulated light curves from  that display a significant secondary eclipse will yield poor fits no matter where the secondary eclipse happens to be , and will lead to the rejection of that particular blend scenario .",
    "( _ ii _ ) for each false positive configuration  can predict the overall photometric color of the blend , for comparison with the measured color index of the candidate as reported in the  input catalog ( kic ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a color index such as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the  magnitude and @xmath30 derives from the 2mass catalog , provides a reasonable compromise between wavelength leverage and the precision of the index .",
    "the latter varies typically between 0.015 and 0.030 mag , depending on the passband and the brightness of the star ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we consider a particular blend to be rejected when its predicted color deviates from the kic value by more than three times the error of the latter .",
    "as it turns out , color is a particularly effective way of rejecting blends that include secondary stars of a different spectral type than the primary , such as those that become possible when allowing for eccentric orbits .",
    "( _ iii _ ) recent refinements in the resolution of the  simulations to better explore parameter space , in addition to the inclusion of eccentricity ( or @xmath20 ) as an extra variable , have increased the complexity of the problem as well as the computing time ( by nearly two orders of magnitude ) compared to the relatively simple case of circular orbits . the number of different parameter combinations examined with  ( and corresponding light - curve fits ) can approach @xmath31 in some cases .",
    "consequently the simulations are now performed on the pleiades cluster at the nasa advanced supercomputing division , located at the ames research center ( california ) , typically on 1024 processors running in parallel . for convenience hierarchical triple configurations ( 4 parameters ) and background / foreground blends ( 5 parameters )",
    "are studied separately , each for the two separate cases of stellar and planetary tertiaries ( for a total of four grids ) .",
    "one additional fit is carried out using a true transiting planet model to provide a reference for the quality of the false positive fits in the other grids .",
    "the discriminating value of the shape information contained in the light curves , mentioned at the beginning of this section , is highlighted by our  results for kepler-10b , as described by @xcite . in that study",
    "it was found that _ all _ background eclipsing binary configurations with stellar tertiaries yield very poor fits to the  light curve , and are easily rejected .",
    "the underlying reason is that all such blend models predict obvious brightness changes out of eclipse ( ellipsoidal variations ) with an amplitude that is not seen in the data , and that are a consequence of the very short orbital period . )",
    "artificially suppresses out - of - eclipse variations to some extent , typically by median filtering , so that the light curves for periods as short as that of kepler-10b ( 0.84 days ) are rendered essentially flat except for the transits themselves . in this sense",
    "the situation is similar to that mentioned earlier regarding the presence of secondary eclipses : obvious ellipsoidal variability in the raw data would normally trigger a false positive warning during the vetting process , preventing the target from becoming an object of interest .",
    "but if it reaches koi status , we assume that out - of - eclipse modulations are insignificant so that the comparison with any  model in which those variations are present is meaningful and would yield a poor fit , sufficient in most cases to reject the blend . ]",
    "hierarchical triple scenarios were also excluded based on joint constraints from  and other follow - up observations .",
    "the only configurations providing suitable alternatives to the true planet scenario involved stars in the foreground or background of the target that are orbited by a larger transiting planet .",
    "the considerable reduction in the blend frequency from the exclusion of all background eclipsing binaries led to a false alarm probability low enough to validate kepler-10b with a very high level of confidence , _ independently _ of any spectroscopic evidence .",
    "this remarkable result speaks to the power of  when combined with all other observational constraints .",
    "it also assumes considerable significance for kepler-10b , given that it was not possible to provide separate proof of the planetary nature of this signal in the @xcite study from an examination of the bisector spans .",
    "the scatter of the bisector span measurements ( 10.5  ) was three times larger than the rv semi - amplitude ( 3.3  ) , rendering them inconclusive .",
    "the situation regarding the  analysis of the koi-072.02  signal in the @xcite study was very different : the orbital period is much longer , and ellipsoidal variations are predicted to be negligible , so that background eclipsing binaries with stellar tertiaries remain viable blends .",
    "this , and the added complication from eccentric orbits , hindered the efforts of those authors to validate this candidate . with the benefit of the enhancements in described above",
    ", we are now in a better position to approach this problem anew .    as follow - up observations provide important constraints that are complementary to those supplied by , and play an important role in determining the false alarm rate for the planetary nature of koi-072.02  ( sect .",
    "[ sec : statistics ] ) , we describe those first below , beginning with our new near - infrared _ spitzer _  observations .",
    "koi-072.02  was observed during two transits with the irac instrument on the _ spitzer _",
    "space telescope @xcite at 4.5(program i d 60028 ) .",
    "the observations were obtained on ut 2010 august 30 and november 15 , with each visit lasting approximately 15hr 10min .",
    "the data were gathered in full - frame mode ( @xmath32 pixels ) with an exposure time of 6.0s per image , which resulted in approximately a 7.1s cadence and yielded 7700 images per visit .",
    "the method we used to produce photometric time series from the images is described by @xcite .",
    "it consists of finding the centroid position of the stellar point spread function ( psf ) and performing aperture photometry using a circular aperture on individual exposures .",
    "the images used are the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) delivered by the _",
    "spitzer _ archive .",
    "these files are corrected for dark current , flat - fielding , and detector non - linearity , and are converted to flux units .",
    "we converted the pixel intensities to electrons using the information on the detector gain and exposure time provided in the fits headers .",
    "this facilitates the evaluation of the photometric errors .",
    "we extracted the utc - based julian date for each image from the fits header ( keyword date_obs ) and corrected to mid - exposure .",
    "we converted to tdb - based barycentric julian dates using the ` utc2bjd ` procedure developed by @xcite .",
    "this program uses the jpl horizons ephemeris to estimate the position of the _ spitzer _  spacecraft during the observations .",
    "we then corrected for transient pixels in each individual image using a 20-point sliding median filter of the pixel intensity versus time .",
    "to do so , we compared each pixel s intensity to the median of the 10 preceding and 10 following exposures at the same pixel position , and we replaced outliers greater than @xmath33 with their median value .",
    "the fraction of all pixels we corrected is 0.02% for the first visit and 0.06% for the second .",
    "-10pt    the centroid position of the stellar psf was determined using the daophot - related procedures ` gcntrd ` , from the idl astronomy library .",
    "we applied the ` aper ` routine to perform aperture photometry with a circular aperture of variable radius , using a range of radii between 1.5 and 8 pixels in steps of 0.5 .",
    "the propagated uncertainties were derived as a function of the aperture radius , and we adopted the aperture providing the smallest errors .",
    "we found that the transit depths and errors varied only weakly with aperture radius for all light - curves analyzed in this project .",
    "the optimal aperture was found to have a radius of 4.0 pixels .",
    "we estimated the background by examining a histogram of counts from the full array .",
    "we fit a gaussian curve to the central region of this distribution ( ignoring bins with high counts , which correspond to pixels containing stars ) , and we adopted the center of this gaussian as the value of the residual background intensity .",
    "as seen already in previous _",
    "warm spitzer _",
    "observations @xcite , we found that the background varies by 20% between three distinct levels from image to image , and displays a ramp - like behavior as function of time .",
    "the contribution of the background to the total flux from the stars is low for both observations , from 0.1% to 0.55% depending on the image .",
    "therefore , photometric errors are not dominated by fluctuations in the background .",
    "we used a sliding median filter to select and trim outliers in flux and position greater than 5@xmath34 , representing 1.6% and 1.3% of the data for the first and second visits , respectively .",
    "we also discarded the first half - hour s worth of observations , which is affected by significant telescope jitter before stabilization .",
    "the final number of photometric measurements used is 7277 and 7362 .",
    "the raw time series are presented in the top panel of figure  [ fig : spitzerlightcurves ] .",
    "we find that the point - to - point scatter in the photometry gives a typical signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of 280 per image , which corresponds to 90% of the theoretical signal - to - noise .",
    "therefore , the noise is dominated by poisson statistics .      in order to determine the transit parameters and associated uncertainties from the _ spitzer _  time series we used a transit light curve model multiplied by instrumental decorrelation functions , as described by @xcite",
    "the transit light curves were computed with the idl transit routine ` occultsmall ` from @xcite . for the present case we allowed for a single free parameter in the model , which is the planet - to - star radius ratio @xmath35 ( or equivalently , the depth , in the absence of limb darkening ) .",
    "the normalized orbital semi - major axis ( system scale ) @xmath36 , the impact parameter @xmath18 , the period @xmath37 , and the time of mid transit @xmath38 were held fixed at the values derived from the  light curve , as reported by @xcite and summarized below in sect .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "limb darkening is small at 4.5 , but was nevertheless included in our modeling using the 4-parameter law by @xcite and theoretical coefficients published by @xcite .",
    "spitzer_/irac photometry is known to be systematically affected by the so - called `` pixel - phase effect '' ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this effect is seen as oscillations in the measured fluxes with a period corresponding to that of the telescope pointing jitter .",
    "for the first visit this period was 70  min , and the amplitude of the oscillations was approximately 2% peak - to - peak ; for the second visit the period was 35  min , and the amplitude about 1% .",
    "we decorrelated our signal in each channel using a linear function of time for the baseline ( two parameters ) and a quadratic function of the psf position ( four parameters ) to correct the data for each channel .",
    "we performed a simultaneous levenberg - marquardt least - squares fit to the data @xcite to determine the transit and instrumental model parameters ( 7 in total ) .",
    "the errors on each photometric point were assumed to be identical , and were set to the rms residual of the initial best fit .",
    "to obtain an estimate of the correlated and systematic errors in our measurements @xcite we used the residual permutation bootstrap technique , or `` prayer bead '' method , as described by @xcite . in this method the residuals of the initial fit are shifted systematically and sequentially by one frame , and then added to the transit light curve model before fitting again .",
    "we considered asymmetric error bars spanning 34% of the points above and below the median of the distributions to derive the @xmath39 uncertainties for each parameter , as described by @xcite .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : spitzerlightcurves ] shows the best - fit model superimposed on the observations from the two visits combined , with the data binned in 36min bins for clarity ( 295 points per bin ) .",
    "the transit depths at 4.5  ( after removing limb - darkening effects ) are @xmath40 ppm for the first visit and @xmath41 for the second , which are in good agreement with each other .",
    "the weighted average depth of @xmath0 is consistent with the non - limb - darkened value of @xmath1 ppm derived from the  light curve @xcite well within the 1@xmath34 errors , strongly suggesting the transit is achromatic , as expected for a planet .",
    "the above _ spitzer _",
    "observations provide a useful constraint on the kinds of false positives ( blends ) that may be mimicking the koi-072.02signal . for example",
    ", if kepler-10 were blended with a faint unresolved background eclipsing binary of much later spectral type that manages to reproduce the transit depth in the  passband , the predicted depth at 4.5  may be expected to be larger because of the higher flux of the contaminating binary at longer wavelengths compared to kepler-10 .",
    "since the transit depth we measure in the near infrared is about the same as in the optical , this argues against blends composed of stars of much later spectral type .",
    "based on model isochrones and the properties of the target star ( see below ) , we determine an upper limit to the secondary masses of 0.77@xmath42 .",
    "spitzer _",
    "constraint is used in sect .",
    "[ sec : blender_app ] to eliminate many blends .      further constraints of a different kind are provided by high - resolution imaging as described in more detail by @xcite .",
    "briefly , these consist of speckle observations obtained on ut 2010 june 18 with a two - color ( approximately @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) speckle camera on the wiyn 3.5 m telescope on kitt peak ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and near - infrared ( @xmath45-band ) adaptive optics ( ao ) observations conducted on ut 2009",
    "september 8 with the pharo camera on the 5 m palomar telescope .",
    "no companions were detected around kepler-10 within 15 ( for speckle ) or 125 ( ao ) , and more generally these observations place strong limits on the presence of other stars as a function of angular separation ( down to 005 in the case of speckle ) and relative brightness ( companions as faint as @xmath46 for ao ) .",
    "these sensitivity curves are shown in fig .",
    "9 of @xcite , and we make use of that information below .",
    "high - resolution spectra described also by @xcite and obtained with the hires instrument on the 10 m keck  i telescope place additional limits on the presence of close companions falling within the spectrograph slit ( 087 ) , such that stars within about 2 magnitudes of the target would generally have been seen .",
    "a small chance remains that these companions could escape detection if their radial velocity happens to be within a few  of that of the target ( which is a narrow - lined , slowly rotating star with @xmath47 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that the spectral lines are completely blended .",
    "this would be extremely unlikely for a chance alignment with a background / foreground star , but not necessarily for physically associated companions in wide orbits , i.e. , with slow orbital motions .",
    "we explored this through monte carlo simulations .",
    "the results indicate that the probability of having a physical companion within a conservative range of @xmath4810  of the rv of the target that would also go unnoticed in our speckle observations , and that additionally would not induce a rv drift on the target large enough to have been detected in the high - precision measurements of @xcite , is only about 0.1% .",
    "finally , an analysis of the image centroids measured from the observations rules out background objects of any brightness beyond about 2  of the target .",
    "this exclusion limit ( equivalent to half a pixel ) is considerably more conservative than the 06 reported by @xcite , and accounts for saturation effects not considered earlier ( given that at @xmath11 the star is very bright by  standards ) as well as quarter - to - quarter variations ( where `` quarters '' usually represent 3-month observing blocks interrupted by spacecraft rolls required to maintain the proper illumination of the solar panels ) .",
    "the  photometry used here is the same as employed in the work of @xcite , and was collected between 2009 may 2 and 2010 january 9 .",
    "these dates correspond to  quarter  0 ( first nine days of commissioning data ) through the first month of quarter  4 . for this study we used only the long - cadence observations ( 10,870 measurements ) obtained by the spacecraft at regular intervals of about 29.4 min .",
    "all blend models generated with  were integrated over this time interval for comparison with the measurements .",

    "a fit that is worse by @xmath61 16.3 is different at the 3@xmath34 level .",
    "hierarchical triple blends giving poorer fits than this are considered here to be ruled out by the  photometry . for background / foreground scenarios ( 5 degrees of freedom )",
    "the 3@xmath34 blend rejection level is @xmath61 18.2 .      in this section",
    "we describe the simulations carried out for the four general blend configurations mentioned above .",
    "although the secondaries for the background scenarios can in principle also be evolved stars ( giants ) , as opposed to main - sequence stars , we consistently found that the transit light curves generated by such systems give a very poor match to the observations because they do not have the right shape ( the ingress / egress phases are too long ) .",
    "therefore , we restricted our exploration of parameter space to main - sequence stars only .    an additional possibility for a false positive may stem from an error in the determination of the orbital period .",
    "if the true period were twice the nominal value , alternating transit events would correspond to primary and secondary eclipses , implicating a blended eclipsing binary .",
    "the primary and secondary eclipses would often ( but not always ) be of different depth . as part of the vetting process for each candidate , the  team examines the even - numbered and odd - numbered events to look for differences in depth that may indicate a false positive of this kind .",
    "as described by @xcite , no significant differences were found for koi-072.02  beyond the 2@xmath34 level , where @xmath34 represents the uncertainty in the transit depth ( 9  ppm ) .",
    "nevertheless , as the possibility still exists that the components of the eclipsing binary are identical , experiments were run with  to examine the transit shape produced by such scenarios , and it was found that the ingress and egress phases are always much too long compared to the observations , as expected for two equal - size stars eclipsing each other .",
    "thus , these scenarios are easily ruled out as well .",
    "the simulations with  indicate that few background blend scenarios with stellar tertiaries are able to mimic the transit features in the light curve at an acceptable level , and they all correspond to somewhat eccentric orbits . in figure",
    "[ fig : backstar ] we show the goodness of fit of these scenarios , with the small closed 3@xmath34 contour representing the region of parameter space within which the fits are satisfactory , according to the criteria given above . only blends with secondary masses @xmath15 larger than about 1.3@xmath42",
    "are allowed , and the eclipsing binary can only be within a small range of distances behind the target ( @xmath62 ) for the dilution effect to be just right , such that the corresponding apparent brightness difference @xmath63 is between 2.5 and 3.5 mag ( see figure ) . the best among these blend models ( located near the center of the contour ) provides a fit that is about 2.1@xmath34 worse than a planet model ( but still acceptable ) , and is shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : fits ] compared against the planet model .",
    "the tertiary stars in these blends are constrained to be very small , between 0.10 and 0.16@xmath42 .    that most blends involving background eclipsing binaries can be ruled out may appear somewhat surprising , and is worth investigating . indeed ,",
    "for a given measured transit depth @xmath64 , a blend can only reproduce the light curve if it contributes at least a fraction @xmath64 of the total flux collected in the  aperture .",
    "thus , one would expect that binaries as faint as @xmath65 mag relative to the target should be able to match that amount of dimming if they were totally eclipsed ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and furthermore , that the measured duration could also be reproduced by a large range of secondary sizes with an appropriate combination of orbital eccentricity and @xmath25 . yet",
    "we find that no blends fainter than @xmath66 give tolerable fits to the light curve ( see figure  [ fig : backstar ] ) .",
    "a visual understanding of the underlying reason for this may be seen in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : fits ] , in which we show a blend model that one would naively expect should be able to match the observations , according to the crude recipe described above .",
    "this particular blend scenario is marked with a cross in figure  [ fig : backstar ] , and corresponds to @xmath67 and @xmath68@xmath42 , resulting in a magnitude difference of @xmath69 for the eb relative to the target . while this model does yield a good match to the measured depth , and even the total duration",
    ", it does nt perform nearly as well in the ingress / egress phases , which are too long when compared against the observations .",
    "the quality of this fit relative to the best planet fit , which can also be seen in the figure , corresponds to a 10.1@xmath34 difference , and therefore  rejects it .",
    "thus , the reason most blends of this class can be ruled out is ultimately the high precision of the  light curves , which provides a very strong constraint on the shape of the transit light curve , and in particular on the size ratio between the secondary and tertiary , which sets the duration of the ingress and egress phases .",
    "there is a very broad range of blends consisting of a background or foreground star transited by a planet ( as opposed to a star ) that are found by  to give satisfactory fits to the data , as shown in figure  [ fig : back_plan ] .",
    "these viable blends occupy the area below the 3@xmath34 contour represented with a thick white line .",
    "secondary stars of all spectral types ( masses ) are permitted , in principle , although in practice other constraints described below eliminate a substantial fraction of them .",
    "all of these blends involve secondary+tertiary pairs that are within 4 magnitudes of the target in the  passband ( diagonal dashed line in the figure ) .",
    "the tertiary sizes in these blends range from 0.42@xmath57 to 1.84@xmath57 .    our _ warm spitzer _",
    "observations set a lower limit of about 0.77@xmath42 for the secondary masses of these blends , as described earlier ; scenarios involving redder stars would result in transits at 4.5  significantly deeper than we observe ( i.e. , deeper than the measured depth + 3@xmath34 ) .",
    "this exclusion region is indicated by the shaded area .",
    "additionally , blends that are much brighter than @xmath70 would most likely have been detected spectroscopically ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so we consider those to be ruled out as well . we indicate this with the green hatched region in the lower right - hand side of the figure",
    "finally , the colors of the background / foreground configurations simulated with provide a further constraint which is represented by the blue hatched area on the lower left of the figure .",
    "this swath of parameter space is excluded because the blends are significantly redder than the color index measured for kepler-10 ( @xmath71 ) , by more than three times the uncertainty in the observed index . as a result of these complementary constraints ,",
    "the only section of parameter space remaining for viable blends involving star+planet pairs is the area under the 3@xmath34 contour and limited from below and on the left by the hatched areas ( color and brightness conditions ) and shaded area ( _ spitzer _  constraint ) , respectively .",
    "all of these blends have the eclipsing pair behind the target ( foreground scenarios are all ruled out ) .",
    "we note that in this star+planet blend scenario white dwarfs can also act as tertiaries , as long as they are cooler than the secondaries so that they do not lead to deep occultation events that would have been seen in the light curve of koi-072.02 .",
    "the above range of tertiary radii ( 0.42@xmath57 to 1.84@xmath57 ) excludes essentially all cool carbon - oxygen and oxygen - neon white dwarfs more massive than about 0.4@xmath42 , as these are smaller than the lower limit set by , which corresponds to 4.7@xmath7 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "low - mass helium - core or oxygen - core white dwarfs that are the product of common - envelope evolution in binary stars can be considerably larger in size , although they appear to be very rare .",
    "the  mission itself has uncovered only three examples to date @xcite .",
    "however , all of them are very hot ( @xmath72k ) , and produce deep and unmistakable flat - bottomed occultation signals .",
    "model calculations such as those of @xcite show that as these helium - core white dwarfs cool , their radii quickly become earth - size or smaller .",
    "therefore , we do not consider white dwarfs to be a significant source of blends for koi-072.02 .",
    "eclipsing binaries composed of two stars physically associated with the target are clearly ruled out by , as they produce very poor fits to the  light curves . for cases in which the tertiaries are planets , viable scenarios identified by  span a range of secondary masses and tertiary radii within the 3@xmath34 contour shown in figure  [ fig : htp_r3 ] .",
    "most of these configurations turn out to involve eccentric orbits , with transit durations longer than those corresponding to circular orbits along with secondary stars that are smaller than the primary ( see figure  [ fig : htp_dur ] ) .",
    "once again other observational constraints are very complementary , and in this case they are sufficient to exclude all of these blends .",
    "for example , the shaded area of parameter space to the left of 0.77@xmath42 is eliminated by the _ spitzer _  observations , as described earlier .",
    "the constraint on the @xmath73 color ( hatched area on the left ) is partly redundant with the nir observations , but extends to slightly larger secondary masses . and",
    "finally , the spectroscopic constraint removes the remaining scenarios corresponding to higher - mass ( brighter ) secondaries .",
    "we conclude that of all the hierarchical triple blend scenarios that are capable of precisely reproducing the detailed shape of the  transit light curve , _",
    "none _ would have escaped detection by one or more of our follow - up efforts , including nir _ spitzer_observations , high - resolution spectroscopy , or absolute photometry ( colors ) . ) , not only here but in all previously discovered transiting planets . for the present purposes we do not consider this `` twin star '' scenario as a false positive in the strict sense",

    "* ) , as the transiting object would still be a planet , only that it would be larger than we thought by about a factor of @xmath74 because of the extra dilution from the companion.[twin ] ] this highlights the importance of these types of constraints for validating  candidates , given that blends involving physically associated stars would generally be spatially unresolved by our high - resolution imaging with adaptive optics or speckle interferometry , and they would typically also be below the sensitivity limits of our centroid motion analysis , so that they would not be detected by those means .",
    "therefore , the only blends we need to be concerned about for koi-072.02  are those consisting of stars in the background of the target that are orbited by other stars or by transiting planets .",
    "in order to estimate the frequency of the blend scenarios ( i.e. , background configurations ) that remain possible after applying  and all other observational constraints , we follow a procedure similar to that described by @xcite for kepler-9d .",
    "we appeal to the besanon galactic structure models of @xcite to predict the number density of background stars of each spectral type ( mass ) and brightness around kepler-10 , in half - magnitude bins , and we make use of estimates of the frequencies of transiting planets and of eclipsing binaries from recent studies by the  team to infer the number density of blends . using constraints from our high - resolution imaging ( specifically , the sensitivity curves presented by * ? ? ?",

    "the recent release by @xcite of a list of 1235 candidate transiting planets ( kois ) from  provides a means to estimate planet frequencies needed for our calculations , with significant advantages over the calculations of @xcite for kepler-9d , which were based on the earlier list of candidates published by @xcite .",
    "not only is the sample now much larger , but the knowledge of the rate of false positives for  is also much improved , and that rate is believed to be relatively small ( 2040% depending on the level of vetting of the candidate , according to @xcite ; less than 10% according to the recent study by @xcite ) .",
    "thus , our results will not be significantly affected by the assumption that all of the candidates are planets ( see also below ) .",
    "an additional assumption we make is that this census is largely complete . among these candidates",
    "we count a total of 267 having radii in the range allowed by  for the tertiaries of viable blends ( i.e. , between 0.42 and 1.84@xmath57 ) . with the total number of  targets being 156,453 @xcite , the relevant frequency of transiting planets for our blend calculation is @xmath75 .",
    "@xcite have recently published a catalog of the 2165 eclipsing binaries found in the  field , from the first four months of observation . only the 1225 detached systems among these",
    "are considered here , since binaries in the category of semi - detached , over - contact , or ellipsoidal variables would not produce light curves with a shape consistent with a transit .",
    "the frequency of eclipsing binaries for our purposes is then @xmath76 .",
    "table  [ tab : new_stats ] presents the results of our calculation of the frequency of blends , separately for background blends with stellar tertiaries ( eclipsing binaries ) and with planetary tertiaries .",
    "columns  1 and 2 give the @xmath29 magnitude range of each bin and the magnitude difference @xmath77 relative to the target , calculated at the upper edge of each bin .",
    "column  3 reports the mean number density of stars per square degree obtained from the besanon models , for stars in the mass range allowed by as shown in figure  [ fig : backstar ] . in column  4",
    "we list the maximum angular separation @xmath78 at which stars in the corresponding magnitude bin would go undetected in our imaging observations , taken from the information in the work of @xcite .",
    "the product of the area implied by this radius and the stellar densities in the previous column give the number of stars in the appropriate mass range , listed in column  6 in units of @xmath79 .",
    "multiplying these figures by the frequency of eclipsing binaries @xmath80 then gives the number of background star+star blends in column  7 .",
    "a similar calculation for the background star+planet blends , making use of @xmath81 , is presented in columns  710 .",
    "we sum up the contributions from each magnitude bin at the bottom of columns  6 and 10 .",
    "the total number of blends we expect _ a priori _ ( blend frequency ) is given in the last line of the table by adding these two values together , and is @xmath82 .",
    "the calculations show that background blends consisting of star+planet pairs contribute to this frequency about three times more than background eclipsing binaries .",
    "while we have assumed up to now that any companions to koi-072.02  within @xmath70 mag of the target would have been seen spectroscopically , we note that relaxing this condition to a much more conservative @xmath83 has no effect at all on the contribution from eclipsing binaries , and a negligible effect on the contribution of star+planet scenarios .",
    "to obtain a bayesian estimate of the probability that koi-072.02  is indeed a planet as opposed to a false positive ( or equivalently , the `` false alarm rate '' , far ) we follow the general methodology of @xcite and compare the _ a priori _ likelihoods of blends and of planets : far = bf / pf . if the _ a priori _ blend frequency is sufficiently small compared the planet frequency ( pf ) , we consider the planet validated . our _ a priori _ blend frequencies above correspond to false positive scenarios giving fits to the light curve that are within 3@xmath34 of the best planet fit .",
    "we use a similar criterion to estimate the _ a priori _ planet frequency by counting the kois in the @xcite sample that have radii within 3@xmath34 of the best fit from a planet model ( @xmath84 ; see table  [ tab : systemparams ] below ) .",
    "we find that 157 among the 1235 kois are in this radius range ( 2.062.38@xmath7 ) , giving pf @xmath85 .",
    "this results in a false alarm rate for koi-072.02  of @xmath86 , which is so small that it allows us to validate the candidate with a very high level of confidence .",
    "the planet is designated kepler-10c .",
    "this result rests heavily on the _ a priori _ frequency of planets from the  mission , derived from the assumption that all 1235 candidates reported by @xcite are indeed planets rather than false positives .",
    "if we were to be as pessimistic as to assume that as many as 90% of the small - size candidates are actually false positives ( a similar rate of false positives as is typically found in ground - based surveys for transiting planets ) , and at the same time that all of the larger - size candidates that come into the blend frequency calculation are real planets ( thereby maximizing bf and minimizing pf ) , the false alarm rate would be 10 times larger than before , or @xmath87 .",
    "this is still a very small number , and our conclusion regarding validation is unchanged .",
    "we note that a rate of false positives as high as 90% yields a planet frequency that is strongly inconsistent not only with the expectations of @xcite and @xcite , but also with the independent results of ground based doppler surveys as reported by @xcite .    in the above calculations we have implicitly assumed similar period distributions for planets of all sizes and for eclipsing binaries .",
    "however , it is conceivable that the results could change if the period distribution of planets such as kepler-10c were significantly different from the one for larger planets that go into the blend frequency calculations , or from the one for ebs ( which have a smaller contribution to bf ; see table  [ tab : new_stats ] ) .",
    "therefore , as a further test we considered the impact of restricting the periods to be within an arbitrary factor of two of the kepler-10c period of 45.3 days , both in our blend frequency calculations and for the _ a priori _ estimate of the planet frequency , pf .",
    "we find that the planet frequencies are reduced by a factor of 4.5 , and the eclipsing binary frequency by a factor of 10.4 , and as a result the false alarm rate for koi-072.02  is @xmath88 , which is about the same as before .",
    "thus , our conclusions are robust against assumptions about the period distributions .",
    "finally , our false alarm rate is conservative in the sense that we have not accounted for the flatness ( coplanarity ) of the kepler-10 system .",
    "only a small fraction of single transiting planets with periods as long as 45 days orbiting background stars ( i.e. , those acting as blends ) are likely to transit , _ a priori _ , whereas a planet of this period such as kepler-10c is much more likely to transit if it is coplanar with kepler-10b . taking this into account would boost the planet frequency ( pf ) and decrease the far by as much as an order of magnitude ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "coplanarity in multiple systems is in fact supported by the large number of multiple transiting system candidates found by @xcite , and their mutual inclinations seem to be small ( 15 ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we consider our estimate of the far for kepler-10c to be conservative .",
    "the stellar , orbital , and planetary parameters inferred for the system as determined by @xcite are summarized in table  [ tab : systemparams ] , to which we add the transit duration .",
    "the small formal uncertainty in the planetary radius ( @xmath892.4% ) derives from the relatively high precision of the stellar radius , which is based on asteroseismic constraints on the mean density of the star . with its radius of about 2.2@xmath7 , kepler-10c is among the smallest exoplanets discovered to date .",
    "the mass is undetermined as the doppler signature has not been detected .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite placed a constraint on it based on the distribution of masses resulting from the markov chain monte carlo fitting procedure they applied to the existing radial - velocity measurements of kepler-10 .",
    "their conservative 3-@xmath34 upper limit for the mass is 20@xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding maximum mean density is 10 g  @xmath90 .",
    "given a precise radius measurement and mass upper limit of 20@xmath4 , some minimal constraints can be placed on the composition of kepler-10c . using the models of @xcite",
    ", we find that an earth - like rock - iron composition is only possible at @xmath89 20 @xmath4 .",
    "lower masses would require a depletion in iron compared to rock , or more likely an enrichment in low - density volatiles such as water and/or h@xmath91/he gas . a 50/50 rock / water composition yields 2.23@xmath7 at 7@xmath4 .",
    "still lower masses are possible with a h@xmath91/he gas envelope . using models presented in @xcite , a planet with a rock / iron core and a 5% h@xmath91/he atmosphere ( by mass ) matches the measured radius of kepler-10c at only 3@xmath4 .",
    "a massive 20@xmath4 core should have attained a h@xmath91/he envelope , and it would appear to be stable at kepler-10c s relatively modest irradiation level , which would lead to a planetary radius dramatically larger than 2.23@xmath7 .",
    "this would tend to favor a scenario where kepler-10c is more akin to gj  1214b @xcite and kepler-11b and kepler-11f , which are all below 7@xmath4 and enriched in volatiles .",
    "the well measured inclinations of both kepler-10b and kepler-10c allow us to put a weak constraint on the true mutual inclination ( @xmath92 ) between the orbital planes of the two planets .",
    "although the relative orientation in the plane of the sky ( i.e. , the mutual nodal angle ) is unknown , the different impact parameters and resulting apparent inclinations place a lower limit on @xmath92 . as discussed by @xcite , the geometric limits to the mutual inclination",
    "are given by @xmath93 , where @xmath94 @xcite and @xmath95 ( table  [ tab : systemparams ] ) are the usual inclinations with respect to the line of sight . assuming a random orientation of the lines of nodes ( which does not account for the _ a priori _ knowledge that both planets are transiting ) , the mutual inclination is constrained to be in the interval @xmath96 , with the most likely values being at the extremes of this distribution .",
    "making the reasonable supposition of non - retrograde orbits , a mutual inclination close to the lower limit of about 5  is most likely for these planets .",
    "a more detailed probabilistic argument requires making assumptions about the number of planets in the kepler-10 system .",
    "this mutual inclination is on the high end of the distribution inferred for other  multiple candidate systems ( 15 ) by @xcite .",
    "if this mutual inclination is typical for planets in this system , then it is relatively likely ( depending on the orbital period ) that other planets , if present , are not transiting . when considering the set of  candidates in multiple systems that have periods less than 125 days ,",
    "the ratio of periods between kepler-10c and kepler-10b ( which is 54.1 ) is by far the highest of all period ratios of neighboring pairs of candidates ( the next highest being 23.4 ) , and is even higher than the period ratios between non - neighboring planets . clearly , there is room for multiple additional planets between kepler-10b and kepler-10c .",
    "the preponderance of tightly - packed  multiple candidate systems suggests that additional planets may exist , and these may be revealed in the future with more detailed transit timing variation measurements .",
    "kepler-10c is the first  target observed with _",
    "warm spitzer_with the aim of testing the wavelength dependence of the transit depth .",
    "this is currently the only facility available that has the capability of detecting such shallow transits at wavelengths that are sufficiently separated from the  passband to be helpful . in this case",
    "the observations were successful , and the transit at 4.5  is shown to have virtually the same depth as in the optical .",
    "this places a very strong constraint on the color of potential blends , which are restricted to have secondaries of similar spectral type as the primary star .",
    "the detailed analysis of the  photometry with combined with constraints from other observations eliminates the vast majority of possible blend scenarios .",
    "this includes most background eclipsing binaries ( leaving only a small range of possible spectral types and relative fluxes for the secondaries ) , most of the scenarios involving chance alignments with a star transited by a larger planet , and all possible hierarchical triple configurations .",
    "the latter are among the most difficult to detect observationally since they are typically spatially unresolved .",
    "the key factors that have allowed this , and made possible the validation of the planet , are the high - precision of the  photometry , the relatively short ingress and egress phases ( which places strong constraints on the size ratio between the secondary and tertiary ) , and the near equatorial orientation , resulting in a relatively flat transit that leaves less freedom for the parameters of the eclipsing binaries .",
    "we expect  to be similarly effective for other  candidates that show similar features in their light curves .",
    "kepler-10c along with kepler-9d and kepler-11 g are examples of transiting planets that have not received the usual confirmation by dynamical means that previous discoveries have enjoyed ( including essentially all ground - based discoveries ) , in which either the doppler signature is detected unambiguously ( and verified by the lack of bisector span variations ) , or transit timing variations in a multiple system are directly measured ( as in kepler-9b and c as well as the five inner planets of the kepler-11 system ) . instead , the planets in those three cases have been _ validated _ statistically , with a bayesian approach to estimate the probability that the transit signals are due to a planet rather than a false positive .",
    "this probability has been computed by first estimating the _ a priori _ likelihood of a false positive , and then comparing it with the _ a priori _ chance of having observed a true planet . in the three cases mentioned above the ratio of the false positive to planet likelihoods is small enough that the planetary nature of the signal is established with a very high degree of confidence .",
    "for kepler-10c the false alarm rate is @xmath2 .",
    "the recent work of @xcite has provided a means of assessing a rough false alarm rate for  candidates as a function of the depth of the transit signal and the brightness of the object . as noted also by those authors ,",
    "while these estimates are extremely valuable for statistical studies , the validation of candidates on an individual basis with a sufficiently high degree of confidence will usually require a much more detailed analysis of false positives , such as we have performed here .",
    "masses for these objects ( other than upper limits ) may of course be difficult or impractical to determine in many cases , but it is worth keeping in mind that some of the most exciting candidates to be discovered by  will be in this category , namely , earth - size planets in the habitable zones of their parent stars . except for stars of late spectral type",
    ", the rv signals will generally be very challenging to detect with the sensitivity of current instrumentation .",

    "<S> the  mission has recently announced the discovery of kepler-10b , the smallest exoplanet discovered to date and the first rocky planet found by the spacecraft . a second , 45-day period transit - like signal present in the photometry from the first eight months of data </S>",
    "<S> could not be confirmed as being caused by a planet at the time of that announcement . </S>",
    "<S> here we apply the light - curve modeling technique known as  to explore the possibility that the signal might be due to an astrophysical false positive ( blend ) . to aid in this analysis </S>",
    "<S> we report the observation of two transits with the _ spitzer _  space telescope at 4.5 . </S>",
    "<S> when combined they yield a transit depth of @xmath0 ppm that is consistent with the depth in the  passband ( @xmath1 ppm , ignoring limb darkening ) , which rules out blends with an eclipsing binary of a significantly different color than the target . using these observations along with other constraints from high - resolution imaging and spectroscopy we are able to exclude the vast majority of possible false positives . </S>",
    "<S> we assess the likelihood of the remaining blends , and arrive conservatively at a false alarm rate of @xmath2 that is small enough to validate the candidate as a planet ( designated kepler-10c ) with a very high level of confidence . </S>",
    "<S> the radius of this object is measured to be @xmath3 ( in which the error includes the uncertainty in the stellar properties ) , but currently available radial - velocity measurements only place an upper limit on its mass of about 20@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> kepler-10c represents another example ( with kepler-9d and kepler-11 g ) of statistical `` validation '' of a transiting exoplanet , as opposed to the usual `` confirmation '' that can take place when the doppler signal is detected or transit timing variations are measured . </S>",
    "<S> it is anticipated that many of s smaller candidates will receive a similar treatment since dynamical confirmation may be difficult or impractical with the sensitivity of current instrumentation . </S>"
