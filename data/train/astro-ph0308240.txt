    "n 157b ( henize , 1956 ) is a crab - type supernova remnant ( snr ) just 7 arcmin from the center of 30 doradus ( bode , 1801 ) in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "it contains a 16-ms x - ray pulsar undetected at any other wavelength ( marshall et al .",
    "there is bright non - thermal x - ray emission with structure on arcsec scales just around the pulsar with an extended feature off to the northwest ( wang and gotthelf , 1998a , 1998b ; wang et al .",
    "there is bright non - thermal radio emission from the extended feature but not at the pulsar location ( lazendic et al .",
    "we shall call the extended emission region the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) .",
    "the overall struture suggests that the pulsar is moving toward the southeast .",
    "there is also extended radio emission toward the south that gives a hint of a shell , suggesting that the remnant may be in transition to becoming a composite remnant with a shell and a pulsar wind nebula .",
    "the differences in the radio and x - ray structures plus the apparent large motion of the pulsar make this snr unusual .",
    "we shall describe its properties and then discuss the implications of the data .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the simularities of the radio and x - ray emission of the pwn component of n 157b but a striking difference toward the pulsar .",
    "the radio emission in the pulsar wind component sits on a plateau of the rest of the remnant .",
    "fine structure in the pwn appears very similar in both wavelength ranges although the radio emission extends further northwest .",
    "this structure probably represents clumpiness in the interstellar medium or in pre - explosion mass loss of the progenitor .",
    "the peak in the x - ray emission in the compact source around the pulsar is 13 times the brightness of the peak in the pwn but in the radio there is nothing seen above the residual brightness of the pwn .",
    "the pulsar lies at @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( wang and gotthelf , 1988b ) about 16@xmath3 out from the center along the se axis of the tail .",
    "the pulsar is about 1@xmath3 closer to the center of the tail than the peak of the x - ray emission .        .",
    "the thin line shows the location of slices shown in figure 3 and the cross is the position of the pulsar.,width=340 ]     wide centered on the radio peak and the ones through the pulsar position are 5@xmath3 wide.,width=340 ]     wide centered on the radio peak and the ones through the pulsar position are 5@xmath3 wide.,width=340 ]    further details of the emission are revealed by the slices presented in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "the emission from the pwn is clearly more extended in all directions at radio wavelengths than at x - ray ones .",
    "the overall symmetry is the same , however , with an approximately elliptical shape centered about a point at @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the radio emission falls off uniformly out to a semi - major axis extent of 20@xmath3 in the se - nw direction and 10@xmath3 in the ne - sw direction .",
    "there is no sign of the pulsar or any enhancement in the radio emission , @xmath6 mjy beam@xmath7 , at the pulsar s position of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( wang and gotthelf , 1988b ) .",
    "the non - thermal x - rays around the pulsar position , on the other hand , show a strong approximately elliptical component , about 7@xmath3 @xmath8 3@xmath3 with its long axis perpendicular to the long axis of the pwn tail .",
    "wang and gotthelf ( 1998 ) suggested that this small source could be a bow - shock from the particles leaving the moving pulsar .",
    "we shall henceforth call that structure the shock region . from the inner ( nw ) edge of this shock ,",
    "the x - ray emission first decreases somewhat and then increases gradually toward the radio center of the pwn but peaks 3@xmath3 before the radio and then falls sharply toward the northwest .      to compare the actual brightnesses of the features , we show their spectra in figure 5 .",
    "the squares represent the integrated values for the radio emission of the entire snr .",
    "they give a spectral index , @xmath9 , of @xmath10 , where the flux density @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 ( lazendic et al . 2000 ) .",
    "xmm - newton spectra , that can not resolve angular detail , show that most of the x - ray emission from the snr has a steep power - law spectrum with @xmath14 although some thermal emission is present as well ( dennerl et al .",
    "they do not give a value for the actual x - ray flux .",
    "for the pwn , the lower frequency radio data do not have sufficient resolution for a good separation of the components so we report only the 4.8- and 8.6-ghz results ( lazendic et al .",
    "the spectral index for the pwn is more uncertain because of the snr background",
    ". the value of @xmath15 could easily be the same as that of the whole snr .",
    "the error of the spectral index for this fit to only the two data points tries to take into account the uncertainty in evaluation of the background .",
    "we can not determine the radio spectrum of the shock region because it is not detected .",
    "we do show the upper limits for its flux density at the two radio frequencies .",
    "the x - ray spectra are from the paper by wang and gotthelf ( 1998b ) .",
    "their formal fits give values of @xmath16 for the pwn and @xmath17 for the bow - shock .",
    "realizing that these errors are only for the formal fits to the data , we suggest that the slopes of both components could be the same but that of the pwn can not be much steeper than that of the shock region .",
    "for analysis , we divide the snr into three parts as outlined by wang and gotthelf ( 1998a ) and discussed above : the elliptical pulsar wind nebula extending northwest from the pulsar with major and minor axes of @xmath18 pc ; the brignt shock region ( @xmath19 pc ) centered just outside the pulsar ; and the entire snr , about @xmath20 pc across , which extends well beyond the images in figures 1 and 2 .    assuming that the pulsar has been moving southeastward from an explosion site at the radio peak , we can estimate its speed using the characteristic spin - down age of 5000 years ( marshall et al .",
    "1998 ; wang and gotthelf , 1998b ) . to have moved 4 pc ,",
    "the pulsar has a speed of 800 km sec@xmath7 , large but not impossible for a pulsar ( arzoumanian et al .",
    "because the pwn emission falls off in all directions from its center , including toward the pulsar , we are led to the conclusion that there was a brief period of particle injection by the pulsar , lasting up to about 1000 years after the explosion occurred .",
    "that period would account for the @xmath21 3/4 pc shift of the x - ray peak from the radio one and also allow for the apparent aging of the electrons on the outer edge of the pwn relative to the center . as higher energy electrons decay more rapidly from their synchrotron emission , those further from the pulsar should be the oldest and thus have reduced x - ray emission relative to the radio and steeper spectra ( pacini and salvati , 1973 ; reynolds and chevalier , 1984 ) .",
    "the particle injection and/or stimulation can not have lasted much longer , however , or the emission in the pwn would still be bright toward the southeast between the pwn peak and the current location of the pulsar .",
    "the emission from the shock region just around the pulsar appears to have arisen from a second injection of particles .",
    "the x - ray brightness rises so drastically just there and appears to sit on top of the decreasing pwn emission in that direction .",
    "the radio emission is below detection level .",
    "we also note that if the injection of particles has been continuous , the x - ray spectrum of the region closest to the pulsar should be flatter ( harder ) than that of the region further from the current pulsar position , but that is not the case .",
    "thus the newer particles around the pulsar must have been injected with a different spectrum or be interacting with a very different medium that those injected earlier near the center of the overall pwn .",
    "finally , the center of this shock source is slightly ( about 1/4 pc ) outside the pulsar position .",
    "these conditions lead us to believe that the object is indeed a shock region caused by the supersonic motion of the particles coming from the pulsar moving at about 800 km sec@xmath7 plus their injection speed and perhaps interacting with a reverse shock from the intitial blast wave . without a more accurate separation of the thermal component of the x - ray emission in that region to evaluate the temperature and density of the gas , we can not determine the actual sound speed but the relative motion could be enough to generate a strong shock wave and compressed magnetic fields across which to accelerate particles to even greater energies than they get from the pulsar . the pulsar may have also encountered a density enhancement which will further increase the total emission to produce the high observed x - ray brightness .",
    "indications of a clumpy medium around n 157b include many h@xmath9 filaments and a very low polarization of the radio emission , presumably caused by significant faraday rotation ( lazendic et al .",
    "the other lumps in the pwn may represent temporary increases due to previous brief episodes of acceleration near density enhancements .",
    "we do nt know the radio spectral index of the shock region so we do nt know if the energy injection in that spectral range is the same for both episodes . to get an approximate ratio of radio to x - ray luminosities , we will assume that the radio spectrum of the shock region is the same as the rest of the snr , @xmath22 .",
    "extrapolation of any value steeper than about @xmath230.3 would require less x - ray emission than observed . with the adopted spectral index , we calculate an upper limit to the radio luminosity between 10@xmath24 and 10@xmath25 hz of @xmath26 erg sec@xmath7 or about 1/2000 of the x - ray luminosity in the 0.2  4 kev band ( wang et al .",
    "this upper limit is a low ratio for either a pulsar wind alone , e.g. 0540 - 693 has a ratio of radio to x - ray luminosity of 1/120 , or for an snr with shock generated x - ray emission , e.g. ad1006 has a ratio of about 1/100 ( taken from allen et al .",
    "perhaps the combined processes may create a harder spectrum at low energies but then a sharper break at the transition between the emission in the two frequency ranges .    while still qualitative , this description of multiple episodes of particle injection from the pulsar is the only one we can come up with to explain all the data . better radio resolution and sensitivity plus improved spectra in all wavelength bands , including a detection of infrared and optical continuum emission , will be important for checking these ideas .",
    "we thank paul plucinsky , steve reynolds , brian fields , you - hua chu , douglas bock , martin guerrero , and pat slane for help and ideas .",
