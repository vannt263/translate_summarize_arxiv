    "the modeling of heavy fermion systems is based on an array of localized spin degrees of freedom coupled antiferromagnetically to conduction electrons .",

    "in contrast , the rkky interaction favors magnetic ordering and is dominant at small values of @xmath6 .",
    "there has recently been renewed interest concerning the understanding this quantum phase transition . in particular , recent hall experiments @xcite suggest the interpretation that in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition the localized spins drop out of the luttinger volume .",
    "starting from the paramagnetic phase , this transition from a large to small fermi surface should coincide with a effective mass divergence of the heavy fermion band .    motivated by the above",
    ", we consider here a very simplified situation namely that of a doped hole in the kondo insulating state as realized by the kondo necklace and related models .",
    "although this is not of direct relevance for the study of the fermi surface , it does allow us to investigate the form of the quasiparticle dispersion relation from strong to weak coupling for a variety of models .",

    "the additional coulomb repulsion displaces the quantum critical point towards smaller value of @xmath23 .",
    "however the physics , in particular the single hole dynamics , remains unchange @xcite .",
    "this allows us to take the limit @xmath24 to map the uklm onto a kondo necklace model ( knm ) which we write as : @xmath25 here @xmath26 is a spin @xmath13 operator , which acts on a spin degree of freedom at site @xmath27 .",

    "clearly , since we have motivated the knm from a strong coupling limit of the uklm , we have to set : @xmath31    the above models all have in common that the only interaction between the localized spins stems from the rkky interaction .",
    "this in turn leads to the fact that at @xmath32 for the klm and uklm or @xmath33 for the knm the ground state is macroscopically degenerate . to lift the _ pathology _ we finally consider a bilayer heisenberg model ( bhm ) in which an independent exchange between the localized spins is explicitly included in the hamiltonian .",

    "in contrast , in the klm related models , uklm and knm , the maximum of the quasiparticle dispersion relation is pinned at @xmath36 irrespective of the value of the interplanar coupling . in those models the effective mass at @xmath36 grows as a function of decreasing interplanar coupling , but remains finite .    in section [ qpr ]",
