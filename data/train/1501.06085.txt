    "wormholes are handles or tunnels in spacetime that are able to link widely separated regions of our universe or different universes in the multiverse model .",
    "such wormholes are described by the line element @xcite @xmath1 using units in which @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 is the _ redshift function _ , which must be everywhere finite to avoid an event horizon , while @xmath4 is the _ shape function_. for the shape function , the defining property is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the _ throat _ of the wormhole .",

    "@xcite : @xmath7 , while @xmath8 away from the throat .",
    "the flare - out condition can only be satisfied by violating the null energy condition .",
    "another aspect of this paper is noncommutative geometry : an important outcome of string theory is the realization that coordinates may become noncommutative operators on a @xmath9-brane @xcite .",
    "the commutator is @xmath10 = i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}$ ] , where @xmath11 is an antisymmetric matrix .",
    "noncommutativity replaces point - like structures by smeared objects . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the smearing effect is accomplished by using a gaussian distribution of minimal length @xmath12 instead of the dirac delta function @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will assume instead that the energy density of the static and spherically symmetric and particle - like gravitational source has the form @xmath13 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite . ) here the mass @xmath14 is diffused throughout the region of linear dimension @xmath12 due to the uncertainty .",
    "the noncommutative geometry is an intrinsic property of spacetime and does not depend on particular features such as curvature .",
    "a final topic in this paper is the possible detection of wormholes in the outer regions of the galactic halo by means of gravitational lensing .",
    "that traversable wormholes may exist given a noncommutative - geometry background is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . to confirm this result and to allow a discussion of possible detection by means of gravitational lensing , we start with the einstein field equations : @xmath15 @xmath16,\\ ] ] @xmath17.\\ ] ]    next , from eqs .",

    "1 ) . since        eq . (",
    "[ e : shape1 ] ) is valid for any @xmath23 , the wormhole can be macroscopic .",
    "we also observe that @xmath8 for @xmath24 .",
    "since we are interested in the detection of wormholes in the outer regions of the halo , we need to recall that in this region test particles move in circular orbits .",
    "so it is assumed that @xmath25 in line element ( [ e : line1 ] ) is given by @xmath26 here @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the tangential velocity and @xmath29 an integration constant @xcite . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath30 . in a wormhole",
    "setting , we can assume that the center of the wormhole also serves as the origin of @xmath31 .",
    "so the line element becomes @xmath32",
    "interest in strong gravitational lensing has increased over time in large part due to a series of studies by virbhadra et al .",
    "in particular , gravitational lensing has been studied from the strong - field perspective by means of the analytic method developed by bozza @xcite to calculate the deflection angle .",
    "this method was used in refs .",
    "@xcite to study two special models by lemos et al .",
    "@xcite , one of which is the ellis wormhole .    to apply these methods to the wormholes in this paper , we will follow the procedures in refs .",
    "@xcite . to do so",
    ", we will take the line element to be @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the radial distance in schwarzschild units , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "then @xmath36 denotes the closest approach to the light ray .",
    "thus from eq .",

    "next , suppose in eq .",
    "( [ e : shape1 ] ) , we choose @xmath61 , the nearest approach , for the radius of the throat . since @xmath62 and @xmath63 , we now have @xmath64 . then @xmath65.\\ ] ] as a result , @xmath59 and the above integral diverges . according to refs .",
    "@xcite , we have a photon sphere at the throat @xmath6",
    ". such a photon sphere can , in principle , be detected .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) model predicts a throat size of 0.40 ly .",
    "so if a wormhole has a throat size that is significantly different from 0.40 ly , it can not be due to the dark matter model , but it would be consistent with a noncommutative - geometry background .",
    "an obvious competitor for the dark - matter model is @xmath0 modified gravity .",
    "let us therefore consider the gravitational field equations ( for the special case @xmath66 ) proposed by lobo and oliveira @xcite : @xmath67 @xmath68,\\ ] ] @xmath69+\\frac{f(r)}{2r^3}[b(r)-rb'(r)],\\ ] ] where @xmath70 .",
    "the curvature scalar is given by @xmath71 using these equations , it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that to account for dark matter , it is sufficient for @xmath72 to be close to unity and @xmath73 to be close to zero .",
    "so if @xmath31 is taken from the nfw model , the results are likely to be similar .",
    "this suggests that a significant departure from a radius of 0.40 ly can be taken as evidence for a noncummutative - geometry background .",
    "the first part of this paper confirms that a noncommutative - geometry background with a static and spherically symmetric gravitational source having the form @xmath74 can support traversable wormholes .",
    "such wormholes may be located in the outer regions of the galactic halo . using a method for calculating the deflection angle proposed by bozza @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the deflection angle diverges at the throat , thereby producing a detectable photon sphere . by allowing a comparison to other models , such as the nfw model and @xmath0 modified gravity ,",
