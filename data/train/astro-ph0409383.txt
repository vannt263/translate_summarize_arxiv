    "as an example , only from january 2001 to june 2003 , more than 1500 new spectroscopic metallicity determinations for field fgk stars have appeared in the literature , increasing significantly the number of calibrating stars with reliable [ fe / h ] values , and hence allowing to better define the metallicity dependence of the t@xmath0 scale .",

    "although these nlte corrections were not specifically calculated for our set of model atmospheres , their relative dependence with t@xmath0 and [ fe / h ] is still useful , and should minimize the scatter of the derived abundances .",

    "are plotted 41 plateau stars ( t@xmath0 @xmath1 6000 k ) as a function of [ fe / h ] , showing an impressive constancy in their li abundance from [ fe / h ] @xmath14 @xmath103.4 to @xmath101 , with an amazingly small scatter and essentially zero slope ( 0.013 @xmath45 0.018 per dex ) .",
    "this figure strongly supports the primordial origin of the li plateau ( spite & spite 1982 ) , and imposes stringent constraints on stellar mixing and galactic chemical evolution .    the very small star - to - star",
    "_ observed _ scatter ( @xmath46 = 0.06 dex ) is fully explained by errors in t@xmath0 and @xmath25 . adding in quadrature the typical errors of @xmath38 t = 66 k ( @xmath47 0.045 dex ) and @xmath26 = 5.5% ( @xmath47 0.025 dex ) ( as well as errors of 0.3 dex in log @xmath30 and [ fe / h ] ) , a predicted error @xmath48 = 0.053 dex is obtained , in excellent agreement with the observed scatter ( @xmath46 = 0.06 dex ) .",
    "note that if the 2 plateau stars with the highest li abundances are discarded , then @xmath46 = 0.05 dex .",
    "the abundances obtained in this work for plateau stars show a very small star - to - star - scatter .",
    "this is a consequence of employing very accurate temperatures based on the irfm and their photometric calibrations .",
    "rm04b , c have shown that the irfm t@xmath0 scale is in almost perfect agreement ( at the 10 k level ) with interferometric measurements of dwarfs and giants with [ fe / h ] @xmath49 .",
    "provided that the plateau is truly primordial , the constancy of the li abundance in our plateau stars indicates that our irfm t@xmath0 scale is also highly reliable when we approach low metallicities , and this would be consistent with the small dependence of the irfm on the detailed assumptions of model atmospheres .",
    "although the li abundances derived in this work have very small internal errors , systematic errors dominate the _ absolute _ abundances .",
    "for example , the use of kurucz models with no overshooting ( nover , castelli et al .",
    "1997 ) results in smaller @xmath5 by about 0.08 dex .",
    "note that the kurucz solar overshooting model reproduces more solar observables than the nover model ( castelli et al .",
    "interestingly , the _ ( r - i)_@xmath50 synthetic colors computed from overshooting models are in better agreement with the irfm t@xmath0 scale than colors computed with nover models , at least for solar metallicity dwarfs ( 6000 k @xmath2 t@xmath0 @xmath2 6800 k , melndez & ramrez 2003 ) and giants ( 4000 k @xmath2 t@xmath0 @xmath2 6300 k , ramrez & melndez 2004a ) .    the mean li abundance obtained for the plateau stars ,",
    "@xmath5 = 2.37 dex , is considerably higher than the primordial li abundance proposed by r01 ( @xmath51 2.0 - 2.1 dex ) . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the reason for this are the lower temperatures adopted by r01 .",
    "the temperature difference ( between our t@xmath0 and those adopted by r01 ) is metallicity dependent , and at very low metallicities ( [ fe / h ] @xmath52 the t@xmath0 adopted by r01 is about 400 k lower than ours .",
    "when the temperatures adopted by r01 are used , we also find a trend of li abundance with metallicity .",
    "if we use the same t@xmath0 ( and @xmath25 ) as those employed by r01 , @xmath53 = 2.13 dex is found for stars with t@xmath0 @xmath1 6000 k and [ fe / h ] @xmath2 -3 , whereas r01 found @xmath53 = 2.07 dex for the same stars ( the small difference is due to the different model atmospheres adopted ) .",
    "note that when magain ( 1987 ) calibration is used in its validity range ( t@xmath0 @xmath2 6000 k , [ fe / h ] @xmath19 ) , the agreement with our t@xmath0 scale is satisfactory ( open circles , fig .",
    "2 ) ; outside that range it may not be appropriate to use it .",
    "most ( 0.07 dex ) of the 0.13 dex difference between the present li plateau abundance and that obtained by bm97 is due to different model atmospheres , and the remaining difference is because our t@xmath0 scale is hotter for metal - poor f dwarfs .",
    "we have compared our irfm temperatures with those given by alonso et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ( employing the same reddening adopted by alonso et al . )",
    "the agreement is good for metal - poor stars with t@xmath0 @xmath2 6500 k , and our temperatures are just @xmath14 50 k higher in the range 6000 @xmath2 t@xmath0 @xmath2 6500 . for hotter stars the differences are larger .",
    "since only 5 stars with t@xmath0 @xmath1 6500 k are included in the present work , their exclusion does not alter our results ( fig .",
    "1 ) , but restricts our claim of the constancy of the plateau to @xmath54 [ fe / h ] @xmath4 and 6000 k @xmath2 t@xmath0 @xmath2 6500 k.    ryan et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have criticized alonso s calibrations for turn - off stars because of their strong metallicity dependence . nevertheless , this effect is predicted by both kurucz and marcs model atmospheres .",
    "for metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] = -3 ) f dwarfs , our ( @xmath55 ) irfm calibration is in good agreement with @xmath55 colors predicted from marcs models ( houdashelt et al .",
    "2000 ) . at [ fe / h ]",
    "= -3 , our calibration ( rm04c ) gives 6250 and 6500 k for @xmath56 = 1.31 and 1.21 , while houdashelt calibration results in t@xmath0 _ higher _ by + 76 and + 7 k , respectively .",
    "the same exercise employing kurucz models at @xmath57 ( m. s. bessell 2004 , private communication ) gives a similar result .",
    "asplund et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have shown that 3d hydrodynamical models with nlte computations give similar li abundances than 1d + nlte . however , that result was obtained neglecting collisions with h , and taking them into account , the li abundance is lowered ( barklem et al .",
    "it is possible to compare 1d calculations ( considering relative nlte corrections ) with 3d nlte results by using the plateau star hd 84937 , which has predicted equivalent widths in 3d nlte ( barklem et al .",
    "2003 ) . employing the same atmospheric parameters and li abundance as given by barklem et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we obtain a 1d @xmath25 = 11.4 m , which is very close to the 3d nlte results , both without collisions ( 11.1 m ) and when collisions are included ( 12.6 m ) . within 0.05 dex ,",
    "both 3d nlte calculations are in ( probably fortuitous ) agreement with the 1d calculation . nevertheless , this result is by any means conclusive , as the 3d results are based on only one snapshot ( barklem et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the observational star - to - star scatter found in this work ( @xmath46 @xmath14 0.05 - 0.06 dex ) is considerably lower than those found in previous analyses of large samples : 0.13 , 0.06 - 0.08 , 0.089 and 0.094 dex according to thorburn ( 1994 ) , spite et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , ryan et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and bm97 , respectively .",
    "this extremely thin scatter of the plateau stars is fully explained by small errors in t@xmath0 and @xmath25 , leaving little room ( if any ) for mixing or galactic evolution .",
    "considering the constancy of the li abundance of the plateau stars , depletion is constrained probably at a level of 0.05 dex , and if rotational mixing plays a role , then our mean @xmath5 should be slightly increased .    within the _ absolute _ abundance uncertainties involved ( of the order of 0.1 dex ) in our simple 1d modeling , we conclude that our results are just in marginal agreement with the constraint imposed by wmap , and if new physics or non - standard big bang nucleosynthesis are invoked ( e.g. feng et al .",
