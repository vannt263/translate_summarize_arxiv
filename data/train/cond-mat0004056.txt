    "semiconductor quantum wire structures , based mostly on gaas - algaas systems , have been studied intensively for the last ten years as systems of potential technological interest ( e.g. quantum wire lasers ) , and also because of their fundamental significance as examples of quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) electron liquids . among the important research milestones in semiconductor quantum wires",
    "are the observation @xcite of one dimensional plasmons via the inelastic light scattering spectroscopy and the verification of the predicted acoustic linear plasma dispersion relation @xcite in one dimension , the observation of pronounced one dimensional fermi edge singularities in the optical spectra @xcite , the quantum wire excitonic laser operation @xcite and its theoretical understanding @xcite . with improving materials growth and nano - fabrication techniques",
    "one expects a wide range of one dimensional experimental phenomena and projected applications in semiconductor quantum wire systems .",
    "many of the projected applications such as ballistic electron transistors , quantum wire - based infrared photo - detectors and lasers , quantum wire thz oscillators and modulators , will utilize fast carriers ( injected or excited ) in doped quantum wires as the active device element .",
    "effective control and manipulation of these fast electrons in doped quantum wire systems are therefore essential in the projected quantum wire opto - electronic applications .",
    "one of the most crucial physical processes that will limit the quantum wire opto - electronic applications is the relaxation of these fast electrons .",
    "the main ultrafast mechanism controlling the relaxation process is the electron - electron interaction , which is also a many - body process of fundamental importance in electronic systems . in this paper , we develop a many - body theory for the electron - electron interaction induced ultrafast relaxation in semiconductor quantum wires with more than one quantized subband occupied .",
    "we consider only the ultrafast electron - electron interaction induced relaxation in this article , neglecting the weaker electron - phonon frhlich coupling .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling may be considered to be approximately included in our theory by taking the effective mass entering the theory to be the polaronic band mass ( including the electron - lo phonon interaction ) and the background dielectric constant to be the static low frequency lattice dielectric constant ( rather than the dynamic high frequency dielectric constant ) .",
    "we restrict ourselves to coulomb scattering because the fastest relaxation time scales are controlled by the inter - electron coulomb interaction .",
    "we mention that semiconductor quantum wires in the strict one dimensional limit with only one occupied subband are extremely difficult to fabricate .",
    "thus the typical experimental quantum wires would have a few occupied subbands and scattering between these subbands effectively destroys their strict one dimensionality .",
    "the work presented in this article takes a first step toward developing a full many - body theory for quantum wires with many occupied subbands by considering carefully the situation with two occupied subbands and by analyzing the resultant relaxation rates in terms of intrasubband ( one dimensional ) and intersubband ( non - one dimensional ) scattering contributions .",
    "in addition , we calculate single - particle and collective mode contributions to the relaxation rates separately .",
    "our calculations can be directly compared with experimentally measured linewidths ( e.g. the spectral width in tunneling measurements @xcite or in the femtosecond spectroscopy @xcite ) or band broadenings and with various relaxation rates entering device modelling considerations .",
    "intra- and intersubband relaxation of electrons in q1d doped semiconductor quantum wires are determined by their inelastic lifetime which is inversely proportional to the inelastic coulomb scattering rate .",
    "due to the coulomb interaction , electrons in the quantum wires may be scattered and , as a result , collective ( plasmons ) and single - particle excitations are emitted .",
    "such lifetime calculations have earlier been carried out in 2d electrons systems @xcite , and have been interpreted in terms of plasmon emission processes .",
    "in contrast to 2d electrons gases , a gap shows up in the intersubband single - particle excitation continuum in q1d quantum wires with two occupied subbands .",
    "@xcite furthermore , an extra intersubband plasmon mode appears within such a gap .",
    "it was also shown previously that , for a two - subband quantum wire , @xcite the intersubband inelastic - scattering rates due to plasmon modes and single - particle excitations do not exist if the intersubband coupling is neglected .",
    "but the intrasubband inelastic - scattering rates were found consist of three contributions : that coming from the emission of plasmon modes in the ( i ) first and ( ii ) second subband ; and the emission of a ( iii ) single - particle excitation in the second subband",
    ". so far in the literature the intersubband coupling in quantum wires has been considered irrelevant for electron relaxation in the conduction band . however , as the second subband becomes occupied , electrons in different subbands may interact strongly with each other , and as a consequence , intersubband coupling should in general be taken into account . in this paper",
    "we calculate the intra- and intersubband inelastic - scattering rates of electrons in a two - subband quantum wires with a small energy separation between the two subbands .",
    "we neglect the higher lying subbands to reduce computational complications",
    ". a generalization of our theory to many subbands is , in principle , possible .",
    "currently there are no direct experimental observations of intersubband lifetimes in multisubband quantum wires , but our calculations should be relevant to a large number of projected applications .",
    "we develop our theory for the inelastic coulomb scattering treating the dynamical screening of the q1d electron system within the framework of the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "the rpa has been shown to be an excellent approximation in studying charge - density excitations in q1d doped semiconductors by virtue of the approximate vanishing of all vertex corrections to the one - dimensional irreducible polarizability .",
    "@xcite in addition to the 1d intrasubband plasmons , the intersubband collective and single - particle excitations in the q1d system also provide relaxation channels through which the hot electrons in the conduction band relax .",
    "we show that the inelastic - scattering rate from the second to the first subband can only occur through the emission of an intersubband plasmon with single - particle excitations not participating at all in this intersubband relaxation process , whereas emission of both collective and single - particle excitations contributes to the inelastic scattering from the first to the second subband .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe our theoretical approach . in sec .",
    "iii we present our numerical results for the inelastic scattering rates in a two - subband quantum wire .",
    "we conclude with a summary in sec . iv .",
    "the single electronic states in our theory are calculated by considering a two - dimensional system in the @xmath0 plane subjected to an additional confinement in the @xmath1-direction creating a gaas / algaas quantum wire in the @xmath2-direction .",
    "the confinement potential in the @xmath1-direction is taken to be of a finite square well type of barrier height @xmath3 and well width @xmath4 .",
    "we assume the confinement potential creating the 2d confinement to be sufficiently strong compared with the 1d confinement potential and assume the 2d system to be ideal , i.e. of zero thickness in the third ( z ) direction .",
    "the 1d subband energies @xmath5 and the wave functions @xmath6 are obtained from the numerical solution of the one - dimensional schrdinger equation in the @xmath1-direction ( the value of the electron effective mass throughout this paper is @xmath7 ) . we restrict ourselves to the case where @xmath8 and define @xmath9 as being the intersubband energy gap between the two subbands . for a symmetric confinement potential , the two lowest wave functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the usual symmetric and antisymmetric levels , respectively .",
    "we consider throughout this paper the confinement potential being of a barrier height @xmath3 = 100 mev and well width @xmath12  , which leads to @xmath135.37 mev .",
    "then , the second subband becomes populated at 1d electron density @xmath14 @xmath15 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we neglect inelastic scattering due to emission of phonons .",
    "such a procedure is reasonable since the emission of an lo phonon , for example in gaas , requires the electron energy to be at least @xmath16 mev which is much larger than the characteristic inter - subband energy @xmath17 of our quantum wire .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to situations where phonon emission processes are not important .",
    "we take @xmath18 throughout this paper unless stated otherwise .",

    ", vinter @xcite originally showed that , at zero temperature , the inelastic coulomb scattering rate @xmath25 of electrons in multisubband structures can be obtained from the imaginary part of the retarded electron self - energy neglecting higher order vertex corrections .",
    "this approximation is extensively employed in calculating electronic many - body effects and , in particular , has been used in studying injected electron lifetimes in semiconductor quantum wire structures in the strict one - dimensional limit ( or equivalently in determining the intrasubband inelastic scattering rate of electrons in the first quantized subband ) , @xcite as well as in coupled parallel quantum wires.@xcite within the gw approximation , the multisubband inelastic scattering rate @xmath26 of fast electrons in quasi - one - dimensional quantum wires at zero temperature is given by @xmath27\\right\\}\\ ] ] @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the standard step function , @xmath30 the dynamically screened electron - electron coulomb potential with @xmath31 being the 1d wavevector and @xmath32 the mode frequency , and @xmath33 the electron energy with respect to the fermi energy @xmath34 .",

    "the polarizability @xmath44 characterizes the bare electron - hole bubble polarization diagram and is written for the system free from any impurity scattering .",
    "the impurity scattering effects can be introduced diagrammatically by including impurity ladder diagrams in the electron green s function .",
    "these diagrams are responsible for level broadening , or equivalently , for a phenomenological damping constant @xmath45 mainly induced by scattering of electrons due to impurity centers , with @xmath46 being the carrier mobility in the sample .",

    "in contrast to figs . 5 and 6 , where effects of @xmath50 ( @xmath204 ) are vanishingly small , a finite @xmath205 has some effect in fig .",
    "notice that , for extremely clean systems ( @xmath206 ) , the contributions to both @xmath207 coming from the plasmon mode @xmath72 ( square lines ) , should go to infinity threshold due to the singular nature of 1d density of states .",

    "within the gw approximation , we have calculated the inelastic coulomb scattering rates and lifetimes of an injected electron in a symmetric confinement two - subband quantum wire at zero temperature .",
    "these rates are directly related to the dynamically screened coulomb potential which has been calculated within the rpa .",
    "we chose a quantum wire with symmetric confinement potential in which the intra- and intersubband excitations do not interact with each other .",
    "we obtain the effects of the population of second subband on the inelastic coulomb scattering rate .",
    "we separately identified the contributions to the intrasubband and intersubband inelastic - scattering rates due to different intrasubband and intersubband excitations in the individual subbands of the q1d electron system .",
    "we find the emission of an intrasubband plasmon in the first subband to be the most important contribution to the inelastic - scattering rate , although the single - particle excitations as well as plasmon modes in the second subband also contribute to the intrasubband and intersubband scattering of an electron in the two - subband quantum wire .",
    "we found that the inelastic scattering from the first to the second subband occurs through the emission of either intersubband plasmon modes or intersubband single - particle excitations , whereas the scattering from second to first subband only occurs via the emission of the higher energy intersubband plasmon mode .",
