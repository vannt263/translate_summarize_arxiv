    "the aim of this thesis is to shed some light on the geometric aspects of certain problems that lie in the heart of harmonic analysis .",
    "in particular , being interested in harmonic analytic problems that involve tubes , we shrink the tubes to lines , and thus formulate discrete versions of the original problems , avoiding analytical factors , such as volumes , and focusing mainly on the geometry of the problems , such as the directions of the lines .    more specifically , given a collection of lines in three - dimensional space , we are interested in the points at which at least three non - coplanar lines of our collection meet . the problem of controlling the number of such points by the number of the lines is a natural analogue of a very important , open harmonic analytic problem .",
    "this is the main question we are addressing in this thesis , together with certain variants of it .",
    "any expression of the form @xmath9 or @xmath10 means that there exists a non - negative constant @xmath11 , depending only on the dimension , such that @xmath12 , while any expression of the form @xmath13 means that there exists a non - negative constant @xmath14 , depending only on the dimension and @xmath15 , ... , @xmath16 , such that @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , any expression of the form @xmath18 or @xmath19 means that @xmath20 or @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "finally , any expression of the form @xmath22 means that @xmath9 and @xmath18 , while expression of the form @xmath23 means that @xmath24 and @xmath19 .",
    "this chapter is a presentation of the two problems we will address in this thesis . apart from their prominent geometric and combinatorial structure , the importance of these problems also lies in the fact that they all constitute discrete analogues of harmonic analytic problems .",
    "in fact , turning harmonic analytic questions into discrete ones , even in different field settings , is a tactic attracting a lot of attention recently .",
    "the reason for this is that it allows us to deprive our initial problems , some of which are still open , of their underlying analytical nature , and thus eliminate factors that could distract us from understanding their essential geometric structure .",
    "more particularly , our questions mainly arise from the study of kakeya sets in @xmath25 .    _ * ( kakeya set ) * _ a compact subset @xmath26 of @xmath25 is called a _",
    "kakeya set _ , if it contains a unit line segment in each direction .",
    "even though it has been proved that there exist kakeya sets in @xmath25 with lebesgue measure zero , it is conjectured that they are still quite large , in the following sense .    _",
    "( * kakeya set conjecture * ) _ the hausdorff dimension of a kakeya set in @xmath25 is equal to @xmath27 , for all @xmath28 .    in fact , the truth of the kakeya set conjecture",
    "would be implied by the truth of the following , harder conjecture .    _ * ( maximal kakeya operator conjecture ) * _ if @xmath29 , for @xmath30 , are tubes in @xmath25 with length 1 and cross section an @xmath31-dimensional ball of radius @xmath32 , such that their directions @xmath33 are @xmath32-separated , then @xmath34 for all @xmath28 , where @xmath35 is a constant depending only on @xmath27 .",
    "the maximal kakeya operator conjecture , and therefore the kakeya set conjecture , have been resolved in the case @xmath36 , but not in any other . however , a variant of the maximal kakeya operator conjecture , and in particular its multilinear version , has recently been proved by guth in @xcite for all dimensions , with the use of profound algebraic techniques :    _ * ( endpoint multilinear kakeya theorem ) * _ let @xmath37 be a set of orthonormal vectors in @xmath25 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , ... , @xmath40 finite families of doubly infinite tubes in @xmath25 , with cross section an @xmath31-dimensional unit ball , such that , for each @xmath41 , the direction of each of the tubes in @xmath42 lies in a fixed @xmath43-cap around @xmath44 , for some explicit constant @xmath45 .",
    "then , there exists some constant @xmath46 , depending only on @xmath27 , such that @xmath47    in our work , we consider the maximal kakeya operator conjecture and the endpoint multilinear kakeya problem , and effectively shrink the tubes to lines , eventually formulating the corresponding discrete questions in @xmath25 ; namely , the problem of counting joints with multiplicities and the multijoints problem , respectively .",
    "in fact , we show that , for @xmath48 , what we expect to be true due to the maximal kakeya operator conjecture and what we know due to the endpoint multilinear kakeya theorem in the continuous case also hold in the discrete case , constituting another indication that the conjecture holds .",
    "these two problems form the main part of the thesis , while we also investigate them in higher dimensions and different field settings , as well as in the case where the lines are replaced with more general , appropriate curves .",
    "we are now ready to introduce our problems in more detail .",
    "a point @xmath49 is a joint for a collection @xmath1 of lines in @xmath25 if there exist at least @xmath27 lines in @xmath1 passing through @xmath7 , whose directions span @xmath25 .    the problem of bounding the number of joints by a power of the number of the lines forming them first appeared in @xcite , where it was proved that if @xmath3 is the set of joints formed by a collection of @xmath2 lines in @xmath0 , then @xmath50 .",
    "successive progress was made in improving the upper bound of @xmath51 in three dimensions , by sharir , sharir and welzl , and feldman and sharir ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "wolff had already observed in @xcite that there exists a connection between the joints problem and the kakeya problem , and , using this fact , bennett , carbery and tao found an improved upper bound for @xmath51 , with a particular assumption on the angles between the lines forming each joint ( see @xcite ) .",
    "eventually , guth and katz provided a sharp upper bound in @xcite ; they showed that , in @xmath0 , @xmath52 .",
    "the proof was an adaptation of dvir s algebraic argument in @xcite for the solution of the finite field kakeya problem , which involves working with the zero set of a polynomial .",
    "dvir , guth and katz induced dramatic developments with this work , because they used for the first time the polynomial method to approach problems in incidence geometry .",
    "further work was done by elekes , kaplan and sharir in @xcite , and finally , a little later , kaplan , sharir and shustin ( in @xcite ) and quilodrn ( in @xcite ) independently solved the joints problem in @xmath27 dimensions , using again algebraic techniques , simpler than in @xcite .",
    "in particular , quilodrn and kaplan , sharir and shustin showed that , if @xmath1 is a collection of @xmath2 lines in @xmath25 , @xmath28 , and @xmath3 is the set of joints formed by @xmath1 , then    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is a constant depending only on the dimension @xmath27 .    in this setting",
    ", we define the multiplicity @xmath6 of a joint @xmath7 as the number of @xmath27-tuples of lines of @xmath1 through @xmath7 , whose directions span @xmath25 ; we mention here that we consider the @xmath27-tuples to be unordered , although considering them ordered would not cause any substantial change in what follows .    from",
    "we know that @xmath55 .",
    "a question by anthony carbery is if one can improve this to get    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is , again , a constant depending only on @xmath27 .",
    "we clarify here that the choice of @xmath58 as the power of the multiplicities @xmath6 on the left - hand side of does not affect the truth of when each joint has multiplicity @xmath59 , while it is the largest power of @xmath6 that one can hope for , since it is the largest power of @xmath6 that makes true when all the lines of @xmath1 are passing through the same point and each @xmath27 of them are linearly independent ( in which case the point is a joint of multiplicity @xmath60 ) .",
    "also , obviously holds when @xmath36 ; in that case , the left - hand side is smaller than the number of all the pairs of the @xmath2 lines , i.e. than @xmath61 .",
    "in fact , as we have already mentioned , the above question can also be seen from a harmonic analytic point of view ( again , see @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , if @xmath29 , for @xmath30 , are tubes in @xmath25 with length 1 and cross section an @xmath31-dimensional ball of radius @xmath32 , such that their directions @xmath33 are @xmath32-separated , then the maximal kakeya operator conjecture asks for a sharp upper bound of the quantity @xmath62 on the other hand , in the case where a collection @xmath1 of lines in @xmath25 has the property that , whenever @xmath27 of the lines meet at a point , they form a joint there , then , for all @xmath63 , @xmath64lines of @xmath1 through @xmath65 , and thus the left - hand side of is @xmath66 therefore , in both cases , the problem lies in bounding analogous quantities , and thus the problem of counting joints with multiplicities is a discrete analogue of the maximal kakeya operator conjecture .",
    "we will indeed show that holds in @xmath0 :    _ * ( iliopoulou , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1))*_[1.1 ] let @xmath1 be a collection of @xmath2 lines in @xmath0 , forming a set @xmath3 of joints .",
    "then , @xmath67 where @xmath45 is a constant independent of @xmath1 .    in chapter",
    "[ 6 ] we generalise the statement of theorem [ 1.1 ] , for joints formed by real algebraic curves in @xmath0 of uniformly bounded degree , as well as curves in @xmath0 parametrised by real univariate polynomials of uniformly bounded degree ( theorem [ 4.2.1 ] and corollary [ jointsforcurves ] , respectively )",
    ".    the basic tool for the proof of theorem [ 1.1 ] , as well as its generalisation , will be the guth - katz polynomial method , developed by guth and katz in @xcite , which we present in chapter [ 2 ] .",
    "note that the proof of for three dimensions that we are providing can not be applied for higher dimensions , as a crucial ingredient of it is that the number of critical lines of a real algebraic hypersurface in @xmath0 is bounded , a fact which we do not know if is true in higher dimensions .",
    "finally , in the somewhat independent chapter [ 7 ] we consider the joints problem in different field settings and higher dimensions .",
    "in particular ,",
    "we investigate the extent to which an application , in different field settings , of the techniques we use in euclidean space to tackle the problem , seems possible .",
    "we also prove that holds in @xmath68 as well , for any field @xmath69 and any @xmath70 ( theorem [ carberyjoints ] ) , while we provide a further result , hoping to shed some light on the way the lines forming a particular set of joints are distributed in @xmath68 .",
    "finally , the combination of these two results gives us an estimate on the number of joints counted with multiplicities in @xmath68 , that is , however , weaker than the one in theorem [ 1.1 ] .",
    "let @xmath71 , ... , @xmath72 be finite collections of @xmath73 , ... ,",
    "@xmath74 , respectively , lines in @xmath25 .",
    "we say that a point @xmath49 is a multijoint for these collections of lines if , for all @xmath41 , there exists a line @xmath75 , such that @xmath76 and the directions of the lines @xmath77 , ... , @xmath78 span @xmath25 ( in other words , such that @xmath7 is a joint for the collection @xmath79 of lines ) .",
    "the multijoints problem lies in bounding the number of multijoints by a number depending only on the cardinalities of the collections of lines forming them .",
    "more specifically , let @xmath3 be the set of multijoints formed by collections @xmath71 , ... , @xmath72 of lines in @xmath25 .",
    "for each multijoint @xmath63 , we define @xmath80 : @xmath76 for all @xmath41 , and the directions of the lines @xmath77 , ... , @xmath78 span @xmath81 .",
    "anthony carbery has conjectured that , for all @xmath82 ( for @xmath36 it is obvious ) , @xmath83 as well as that @xmath84    in fact , in the particular case where the collections @xmath71 , ... , @xmath72 of lines have the property that , whenever a point @xmath85 lies on the intersection of at least one line @xmath86 from each collection @xmath87 , @xmath88 , the directions of the lines @xmath77 , ... , @xmath78 span @xmath89 , then the multijoints problem gives rise to a discrete analogue of the endpoint multilinear kakeya problem .",
    "indeed , if we denote by @xmath3 the set of multijoints formed by such collections of lines ( a subset of the set of joints formed by the collection @xmath90 ) , while , for every @xmath63 and @xmath41 , @xmath91 denotes the number of lines of @xmath87 passing through @xmath7 , then , under the above additional assumption on the transversality properties of the collections @xmath71 , ... , @xmath72 , becomes @xmath92 note that clearly shows the connection between the multijoints problem and the endpoint multilinear kakeya problem .",
    "indeed , guth s work on the latter demonstrated that , whenever @xmath39 , ... , @xmath40 are @xmath27 essentially transverse families of doubly - infinite tubes in @xmath89 , with cross section an @xmath31-dimensional unit ball ( where , by the expression  essentially transverse \" , we mean that , for all @xmath41 , the direction of each tube in the family @xmath42 lies in a fixed @xmath43-cap around the vector @xmath93 , where the vectors @xmath94 , ... , @xmath95 are orthonormal ) , it holds that @xmath96 i.e. @xmath97 @xmath98 an expression whose discrete analogue is .    using , as for the solution of the joints problem , algebraic methods similar to the ones developed by guth and katz in @xcite , we have proved that holds for @xmath48 , i.e. that the following is true .",

    "<S> in particular , i would like to thank jess , for a lot of time - consuming discussions about real algebraic geometry that were very useful to me . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , special thanks are due to paul , for inspiring me with his love for mathematics , and , to a more practical level , for introducing me to many useful facts about finite fields that i am using in this thesis ; also , for making this last year my happiest one in edinburgh .    </S>",
