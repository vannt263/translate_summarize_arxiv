    "these galaxies were discovered by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( iras ) to be fairly rare in the local universe , but show significant increase as a function of redshift @xcite .",
    "followup optical studies of nearby u / lirgs have revealed that the morphologies of a significant fraction of them resemble interacting / merging systems @xcite , mostly powered by starbursts with increasing contribution from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) for ir - brighter galaxies @xcite .",
    "these galaxies harbor large amounts of molecular gas @xcite that is often concentrated near the compact nuclear regions @xcite .",
    "these observational findings were analyzed in conjunction with numerical simulations that date back as far as the 1970 s @xcite , further advanced with the inclusion of gas dynamics and star formation recipes in the 1990 s @xcite and with realistic feedback mechanisms implemented in the 2000 s @xcite . as a result , it is widely believed that tidally triggered gas compression and subsequent starbursts ( and/or agn fueling ) heat the surrounding dust , are reprocessed into far - infrared emission , and result in the intriguing u / lirg phenomenon we observe in the local as well as the high redshift universe .    since the late 1990 s , with the advent of sensitive mm / submm bolometer cameras mounted on single dish telescopes , observations of the blank sky have revealed the ubiquitous presence of unresolved sources that appear to account for a substantial fraction of the total infrared background radiation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) . by using the correlation between radio and fir @xcite , interferometric",
    "radio observations toward these sources and subsequent followup optical spectroscopy have provided substantial evidence that the origin of this emission is dusty star - forming galaxies that reside at @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the fir luminosities and molecular gas properties in these submillimeter selected galaxies ( smgs ) are generally an order of magnitude larger than the local u / lirgs @xcite . while the fir luminosities in local u / lirgs appear to be powered primarily by starbursts and in some cases a central agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , recent studies have suggested that the agn contribution to the fir luminosity is negligible in the high redshift smgs @xcite .",
    "it has long been proposed that u / lirgs and quasars are linked through dynamical evolution of the host systems , likely by a merger event @xcite .",
    "the initial stages of the merger could be dominated by dusty starbursts ( i.e. u / lirgs and smgs ) , until the central nuclear activity is stimulated by massive gas accretion .",
    "when the cold gas is consumed either by starbursts or accretion onto the central agn , the quasar may become visible as intervening dusty high column density material along our line of sight clears away .",
    "this merger evolution scenario is partially supported by recent deep and high - resolution imaging of quasar host galaxies @xcite , where morphological signatures of interactions / mergers and spheroidal systems are evident .    since the important fuel of the activity , whether it be starbursts or agn , is warm and dense gas , a large sample of molecular line data in ir bright galaxies and quasars at different epochs",
    "is needed .",
    "this data set allows us to test whether the evolutionary scenario is consistent with observations in the local universe , and then to test whether it holds true at high redshifts .",
    "single dish and interferometric observations of the co  ( 10 ) emission in local u / lirgs have been carried out previously , providing significant evidence that the amount of gas in these systems is massive , and highly concentrated in the nucleus ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "similar observations have been conducted in co emission of the redshifted high-@xmath7 transition lines from smgs / quasars ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) , but these observations are difficult due to the requirement of a precise knowledge of the redshift and the lack of sensitivity at mm / submm bands , and therefore the sample is biased toward the brightest ( or gravitationally lensed ) sources .",
    "the majority of the molecular gas detections in the bright smgs / quasars thus far from @xmath8 sources are co  ( 32 ) ( or higher j ) line redshifted to the mm bands .",
    "however , directly comparing the properties of the co  ( 32 ) emission in the smgs / quasars with the co  ( 10 ) emission in the local galaxies can be significantly biased by excitation effects  k and n@xmath9  @xmath10 for co  ( 32 ) whereas t@xmath11  k and n@xmath12  @xmath10 for co  ( 10 ) ] . thus , to properly assess the characteristics of gas in u / lirgs and high redshift smgs / quasars ,",
    "a thorough comparison of a single @xmath7 transition emission line is needed .",
    "we have carried out a program at the submillimeter array ( sma)@xcite to observe 14 u / lirgs in the local universe in the co  ( 32 ) and co  ( 21 ) lines ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper  i hereafter ) .",
    "because the critical density of co  ( 32 ) emission is relatively high , it is considered as an important tracer of the physical condition of the star forming gas and the associated kinematics .",
    "this common belief , however , has not been fully tested observationally because of the lack of high resolution observations of nearby and distant sources .",
    "recent high resolution studies of local u / lirgs show , in some cases , that the distribution and the peak of the co  ( 32 ) emission could be different from the lower transition co ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in order to conduct an analysis that is not biased by excitation effects , we present a detailed comparison of the co  ( 32 ) emitting molecular gas between a local sample of u / lirgs and a high redshift sample that comprises smgs , quasars , and two lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) that have been recently detected in co  ( 32 ) .",
    "we also include co",
    "( 32 ) data from a sample of local quiescent galaxies in some of the analyses .",
    "the u / lirg sample consists of our recent co  ( 32 ) survey using the sma ( paper  i ) while the co  ( 32 ) data for the high redshift and local quiescent galaxies are obtained from the literature .    in  2 , we present the sample data and the formalism for deriving the relevant parameters . in  3 , we investigate the correlation between co  ( 32 ) and fir luminosities in a variety of sources , and offer possible interpretations of the derived slope and the scatter seen in the correlation .",
    "we compare the co  ( 32 ) source size in different sources and offer clues to the merger stage of smgs and quasars in  4 .",

    "observational details and the properties of the local u / lirg data are described in paper  i. the u / lirg sample consists of 14 sources , of which six are interacting / merging galaxy pairs whose nuclei are resolved into multiple components ( `` pre - coalescence '' mergers ) , and eight are mergers whose nuclei are unresolved even with space - based optical images ( `` post - coalescence '' mergers ) . for the remainder of the paper , the local infrared bright galaxies with l@xmath17  l@xmath4 are referred to as ulirgs , whereas galaxies with l@xmath18  l@xmath4 are referred to as lirgs . the term u / lirg is used when referring to the entire sample presented in paper  i , regardless of the fir luminosity .",
    "interferometric co  ( 32 ) data toward smgs were obtained from published results in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",

    "in addition , co  ( 32 ) emission in mips - j1428 @xcite , a submm bright hylirg ( hyper luminous infrared galaxy ; l@xmath19  l@xmath4 ) at @xmath20 , was also included in our smg sample .",
    "the co  ( 32 ) data for the quasars were compiled from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "the l@xmath1 of smgs / quasars are derived by fitting a theoretical starburst spectral energy distribution ( sed ) @xcite to the observed fir to radio flux densities @xcite . the same seds were used to compute the l@xmath1 of the three local ulirgs in our sample , and we found that they are consistent with the @xcite values to within @xmath21% .",
    "the l@xmath1 of the lbgs are obtained from @xcite and @xcite .",

    "we derive the following physical properties for the analysis of this paper .",
    "the derived physical properties of all of the sources are presented in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "\\(1 ) the co  ( 32 ) luminosity , l@xmath0 [ k  km  s@xmath14  pc@xmath22 , is derived using @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the integrated co(32 ) intensity in jy  km  s@xmath14 , @xmath25 is the observed frequency in ghz , @xmath26 is the luminosity distance in mpc , and @xmath27 is the redshift of the source @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the co  ( 32 ) line are estimated using the integrated spectra shown in fig .",
    "2529 of paper  i , and obtained from the published results for the smgs , quasars , and lbgs .",
    "\\(3 ) the source sizes of u / lirgs are the deconvolved fwhm diameters derived by fitting a 2 dimensional gaussian to the co  ( 32 ) integrated intensity maps .",
    "when the deconvolution failed in some of the sources ( mainly due to low s / n ) , the major and minor fwhm axes obtained from the gaussian fits in the image domain are given as upper limits to the source size .",
    "all of the u / lirgs are resolved with the sma beam , except for iras  17208 - 0014 whose deconvolution produces a point source .",
    "however , visual inspection of its integrated intensity map in figure  2 of paper  i suggests that the co  ( 32 ) emission appears to have a bright compact component , as well as a resolved extended structure .",
    "the published sizes are used for the 6 smgs that are resolved by the interferometer .",
    "most of the quasars are unresolved except for sdss  j1148 + 5251 , iras  f10214 + 4724 , and cloverleaf .",
    "high angular resolution vla observations @xcite have successfully resolved the structure in the @xmath28 quasar sdss  j1148 + 5251 , whereas ovro observations @xcite in conjunction with a lensing model have inferred a source size of @xmath29 for the highly lensed @xmath30 quasar cloverleaf . for the remaining unresolved smgs , quasars , and lbgs ,",
    "the minor axis of the beam ( fwhm ) is used as an upper limit to the source size .",
    "because the physical resolution of the high redshift population is worse than the local lirgs , some of the widely separated sources that are resolved with the sma may not be resolved using @xmath31 resolution when they are placed at @xmath32 .",
    "we have tested this by convolving the co  ( 32 ) images of all of the widely separated pairs with @xmath31 ( @xmath33  kpc at @xmath32 ) resolution , and found that all the galaxies are clearly resolved into multiple components except for arp  299 , which is only marginally resolved .",
    "\\(4 ) the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) , l@xmath1/l@xmath0 , is derived by taking the ratio between fir luminosity and co  ( 32 ) luminosity .",
    "the ratio between fir luminosity and molecular gas mass ( i.e. l@xmath1/m@xmath34 ) is often used to infer the sfe of a galaxy , but we opted to use the luminosity ratio ( l@xmath1/l@xmath0 ) in this study to avoid introducing additional ambiguities through variation and uncertainties pertaining to the conversion from l@xmath0 to m@xmath34 .",
    "we caution that the co  ( 32 ) properties at low and high redshifts are generally lower limits for the following reasons . in synthesis imaging ,",
    "incomplete uv coverage results in decreasing sensitivity to extended structure .",
    "while the sma observations are sensitive to structure with size scales of @xmath35 ( 7  10  kpc on average for these galaxies ) , the missing flux calculated by comparing to single dish data is 2  66% ( paper  i ) .",
    "thus the diffuse and extended co  ( 32 ) emission would be undetected in the sma observations , and the values derived in this paper are lower limits to the physical quantities intrinsic to the source . on the other hand ,",
    "observations of high redshift galaxies are limited in both sensitivity and angular resolution .",
    "the relatively coarse angular ( physical ) resolution of @xmath36 ( @xmath37  kpc ) allows us to analyze images that do not suffer significantly from the missing - flux problem .",
    "however , the high redshift population suffers from limited sensitivity ( with mass sensitivity of @xmath38  m@xmath4 ) , and any extended co  ( 32 ) emission could be buried in the noise .",
    "therefore , the physical quantities derived here from co  ( 32 ) data for both the low and high redshift populations are likely lower limits .",
    "the luminosity of the co  ( 32 ) emission line can be a direct measure of the amount of dense molecular gas fueling nuclear ( or extended ) star formation and/or the central agn . the average co  ( 32 ) luminosities ( l@xmath0 ) derived in u / lirgs , smgs , and quasars are @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41  k  km  s@xmath14  pc@xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the l@xmath0 for the two lbgs are @xmath43 and @xmath44  k  km  s@xmath14  pc@xmath42 for cb58 and j213512 , respectively .",
    "the average co  ( 32 ) luminosity in the u / lirgs is more than an order of magnitude lower than in the smgs and quasars , but comparable to the two lbgs . under the assumption that the powering source of the large l@xmath1 is mostly from starbursts ( see  3.1 ) ,",
    "the comparison between l@xmath0 and l@xmath1 relates the amount of available dense molecular gas to the amount of current massive star formation traced in fir dust emission .",
    "this analysis assumes an environment where the gas is sufficiently dense and warm to thermally ( or radiatively ) populate the j=3 rotational energy level of carbon monoxide , and that the gas and dust are coupled spatially .",
    "we investigate the relation between l@xmath0 and l@xmath1 in the following subsection .      in figure  [ fig1 ]  ( @xmath45 ) , we compare the co  ( 32 ) line luminosity with the fir luminosity for all four sample populations .",
    "in addition , we have plotted the same luminosity relation for a sample of local galaxies published in @xcite and @xcite to increase the luminosity range .",
    "the l@xmath0 ",
    "l@xmath1 relation including all four populations ( and local galaxies ) is correlated over five orders of magnitude in luminosity , which suggests that the molecular gas seen in co  ( 32 ) emission is a robust tracer of star formation activity",
    ". a least - squares fit of the form log  l@xmath46 log  l@xmath47 gives @xmath48 and @xmath49 . excluding the local galaxies or the quasars , which may have significant dust heating due to the central agn , does not change the slope with significance .",
    "one potential concern here is that the large range in distance may artificially produce a correlation in log - log space . to check whether the correlation seen here is statistically robust",
    ", we employed the partial kendall @xmath50-coefficient with censored data @xcite where we used the luminosity distance as a test variable .",
    "this analysis yields a probability of @xmath51 that these two variables will produce a false correlation after the effect of distance is removed , providing solid statistical evidence of correlation in logarithmic space .",
    "the near unity slope derived from the l@xmath1 ",
    "l@xmath0 relation suggests that the efficiency of converting co  ( 32 ) emitting molecular gas to massive stars ( i.e. sfe ) is , within a factor of two ( i.e. from the standard deviation ; see below ) , nearly uniform across different types of galaxies residing in vastly different epochs . to illustrate this better",
    ", we plot the sfes against the fir luminosities in figure  [ fig1 ]  ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the average sfes in the various galaxy samples range from a low of 170 for the smgs and lbgs to 250 for the lirgs to 430 for the quasars and a high of 580 for the ulirgs .",
    "the combined average of the smgs , quasars , lbgs and u / lirgs is @xmath53  ( standard deviation = 327 )  l@xmath54 ( k  km  s@xmath14  pc@xmath55)@xmath14 .",
    "the average sfe of the smgs is lower than the u / lirgs by a factor of two , while a slightly higher average sfe seen in the quasars ( and also the ulirgs ) is possibly attributable to higher dust temperature as a result of dust heating by the central agn .",
    "interestingly , the sfes of the smgs are more consistent with the widely separated lirgs ( and the lbgs and local galaxies ) than the ulirgs and quasars .",
    "we will return to this point in our discussion of the evolutionary status of the smgs in  4.2 .",
    "the sfe and l@xmath1 properties of the lbgs are also generally similar to the lirgs , but this sample is currently limited to only two galaxies .    in u / lirgs , the exact fraction of the agn / starburst contribution to the fir luminosity appears to depend on the source @xcite . half of the fourteen u / lirgs in our local sample show evidence for an agn , but only in the two ulirgs mrk231 and mrk273 is it possible that the agn makes a significant contribution to the bolometric luminosity ( paper  i , and references therein ) .",
    "this variation suggests that the scatter in the sfes of u / lirgs not only reflects the physical characteristics of each galaxy , but also the agn heating of l@xmath1 in some sources .",
    "however , we mention the overall trend that the fir output in local iras sources is dominated by starbursts and not agn @xcite , as is evident from the robustness of the empirical radio - fir correlation . in addition , while there is evidence from x - ray surveys that a good fraction of smgs contain agns ( @xmath56 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the energetic contribution of the agn to the fir output in most of the smgs appears to be minor @xcite .",
    "indeed , there is even evidence that most of the far - infrared luminosity in quasars comes from a central starburst @xcite , although there are exceptions @xcite .    in paper",
    "i , it was found that the relation between m@xmath34  ( or l@xmath0 ) and l@xmath1 was not correlated with any significance , leading to an argument that the degree of gas concentration determines the level of star formation activity rather than the overall amount of molecular gas mass available in the galaxy .",
    "due to large scatter in the sfes of lirgs ( see figure  [ fig1 ]  ( @xmath52 ) ) , the correlation indeed breaks down if we only consider the u / lirgs in the fit .",
    "the lirgs that have particularly low sfes ( @xmath57 ) are ngc  6240 , arp  193 , vv  114 , ngc  5257/8 , and ngc  5331 .",
    "optically thin co  ( 32 ) is suggested from previous analysis on ngc  6240 @xcite , and therefore the co  ( 32 ) emission may be over - luminous with respect to other lirgs with optically thick co  ( 32 ) emission .",
    "although arp  193 is apparently a late stage merger , vv  114 , ngc  5257/8 , and ngc  5331 show large nuclear separation suggestive of early stages of interaction .",
    "the sfes of these galaxies are 93  117  l@xmath58(k  km  s@xmath14  pc@xmath55)@xmath14 , which is a factor of three lower than the average of the entire sample .",
    "the factor of two lower average sfe seen in lirgs ( which have a mix of compact and widely separated sources ) compared to ulirgs ( which are mainly compact ) may suggest that the global sfe is lower in early to intermediate stage pre - coalescence mergers than in the centers of more advanced stage mergers , likely because the gas in intermediate stage mergers has not settled in a steady state in the rapidly evolving host stellar potential .",
    "finally , we note that the average sfe in local u / lirgs is a factor of seven larger than l@xmath1/l@xmath59 found in two @xmath60 bzk - color selected ulirgs @xcite .",
    "however , l@xmath1/l@xmath61 may be significantly lower than l@xmath1/l@xmath0 in the same galaxy owing to excitation effects , and future co  ( 32 ) observations of the same @xmath60 bzk selected ulirgs are necessary to compare the true co  ( 32 ) properties of molecular gas in ulirgs at this redshift .",
    "@xcite have obtained upper limits to the co  ( 32 ) emission in three optically selected star forming galaxies similar to the bzk sample ; however , the average lower limit to their sfe ( @xmath62 , where we have estimated l@xmath1 from their measured star formation rates using the relation in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) implies that the local u / lirgs have at most a factor of three times larger sfe .",
    "upper limits to the co  ( 32 ) emission in 5 smgs and 3 quasars @xcite give lower limits to their sfes of @xmath63 to @xmath64 . while most of these limits lie above the average sfe shown in figure  [ fig1 ]  ( @xmath52 ) , significantly more sensitive co  ( 32 ) observations of these sources would be needed to show conclusively that they deviate significantly in their properties from the detected smgs and quasars .      the co  ( 32 ) derived slope ( @xmath66 ) in the l@xmath1 ",
    "l@xmath65 relation is significantly steeper than a previous compilation which includes different excitation lines from local to high redshift sources ( i.e. @xmath67 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is expected because the molecular ism in most of the smgs is subthermally excited in co transitions higher than j = 43 @xcite , and their sample of local u / lirgs mainly consists of observations of j = 10 .",
    "a study that investigates only the co  ( 32 ) line in local galaxies with fir luminosities in the range @xmath68@xmath69  l@xmath4 was conducted by @xcite , where they find @xmath70 .",
    "a more recent study @xcite that relates the co  ( 32 ) to ir luminosity in a similar luminosity range suggests a near linear correlation ( @xmath71 ) . while there is variation in the slope among different studies , the slope between the co  ( 10 ) line and the fir luminosity is even flatter ( @xmath72 ; * ? ? ? * ) than that derived using the co  ( 32 ) emission alone .",
    "the relatively flat co",
    "( 10 ) slope suggests that the co  ( 10 ) derived sfe increases with increasing fir luminosity ( i.e. ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the molecular gas traced in co  ( 10 ) emission is not a linear tracer of star formation activity .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the hcn emission , which is a higher density gas tracer than the commonly used co  ( 10 ) emission , produces a linear correlation with fir luminosity ( @xmath73 ; * ? ? ?",
    "similar recent studies @xcite that include hcn observations from high redshift galaxies have shown , however , that l@xmath1/l@xmath74 in the most distant galaxies is larger than the local sample by at least a factor of two , and the resultant fit between l@xmath75 and l@xmath1 becomes flatter ( @xmath76 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) when high redshift galaxies are included .",
    "these new hcn results suggest that the dense gas fraction in bright high redshift galaxies is even higher than in the local ir bright galaxies .    in figure  [ fig2 ] , we show the different slopes ( @xmath77 ) plotted against the critical densities of the co  ( 10 ) , co  ( 32 ) and hcn  ( 10 ) transitions .",
    "we calculate the critical densities from @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the einstein @xmath80 coefficient for the upper ( @xmath81 ) to the lower ( @xmath82 ) energy state and @xmath83 is the corresponding collision rate obtained from the compilation of @xcite . a general trend that @xmath77 approaches unity for higher critical density tracers is evident from figure  [ fig2 ] .    the slope derived from co",
    "( 10 ) emission , @xmath84 , could be @xmath85 if a fixed fraction of gas converts to stars each free - fall time @xcite . from simple theoretical considerations ,",
    "@xcite argue that , because the critical density of the co  ( 10 ) line is lower than the higher density tracers such as hcn , the co  ( 10 ) line traces the molecular gas that has densities close to the median density of a galaxy .",
    "on the other hand , molecules with high critical densities ( such as the hcn  ( 10 ) line ) trace the ism with much higher densities . in this case",
    ", l@xmath1/l@xmath75 does not depend strongly on the mean density of the galaxy , and therefore the slope derived from the hcn  ( 10 ) measurements ( i.e. @xmath86 ) should be close to unity .",
    "they find , however , that the dependence of l@xmath1/l@xmath75 to the mean density becomes more significant at higher ( @xmath87  @xmath10 ) mean densities , suggesting that the slope can be flatter at the highest luminosity regime .",
    "we plot the two theoretical predictions for @xmath84  ( dotted line ) and @xmath86  ( short dashed line ) in figure  [ fig2 ] as horizontal lines .",
    "the observations for these two emission lines are consistent with the theoretical predictions , and the new measurement by @xcite is also consistent with the prediction by @xcite that @xmath88 is less than unity when galaxies with higher mean densities ( represented by high redshift sources ) are included in the fit .",
    "our co  ( 32 ) measurements , as well as those measured by others , fall between the co  ( 10 ) and hcn  ( 10 ) derived slopes , but the work by @xcite was limited to an isothermal case , and therefore could not investigate higher transition lines that are excited at higher temperatures such as the co  ( 32 ) line .",
    "a theoretical investigation was performed by @xcite to understand the dynamically evolving ism of isolated and interacting galaxies . from their n - body / sph simulations that include radiative transfer , they find that the total co  ( 32 ) luminosity has a mix of contribution from the dense cores ( sites of star formation ) and the more extended molecular gas that is subthermally excited .",
    "they argue that co  ( 32 ) and fir luminosities are linearly correlated under the assumption that the gas density and sfr density are related by a schmidt law @xcite index of 1.5 .",
    "further , a notable scatter is seen in the low luminosity end of their co  ( 32 )  fir luminosity relation , which is caused by line trapping of the co  ( 32 ) line by molecular gas surrounding the dense star forming cores and suggests that subthermally excited co  ( 32 ) gas can provide a substantial contribution to the overall l@xmath0 .    in order to investigate the co  ( 32 ) excitation at different spatial scales , we derived the total ( @xmath89 ) and peak ( @xmath90 ) co  ( 32 ) to co  ( 10 ) ratios in u / lirgs using the co  ( 10 ) data available in the literature .",
    "the results are presented in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "the average @xmath89 is 0.48 , ranging from 0.20 ( arp  55 ) to 1.25 ( arp  299w ) , whereas the average @xmath90 is 0.96 , ranging from 0.36 ( ngc  5257 ) to 3.21 ( ngc  6240 ) . on average , @xmath90 is two times higher than @xmath89 .",
    "the two ratios are comparable for some of the compact sources such as iras  17208 - 0014 , ugc  5101 , arp  299w , or ngc  5331n , but much larger in ngc  6240 ( a factor of four larger ) .",
    "the lowest @xmath90 is derived in the brightest ulirg in our sample , iras  17208 - 0014 .",
    "the general inference of these results is that the co  ( 32 ) transition is nearly thermalized ( in the optically thick limit ) in the inner 1  3  kpc of the u / lirgs , whereas the co  ( 32 ) transition is subthermally populated in the extended outskirts .",
    "this result is consistent with the theoretical prediction by @xcite , possibly suggesting that the scatter seen in the u / lirgs in figure  [ fig1 ] reflects the excitation characteristics of each galaxy .",
    "finally , we note that the @xmath91 co  ( 32 ) emission in smgs / quasars is nearly thermalized @xcite , and this could be the reason for the tighter correlation seen in the smgs in figure  [ fig1 ] .    in order to obtain a better physical understanding of the observed variation in @xmath77 as well as the observed scatter in the sfes",
    ", we constructed a series of large velocity gradient ( lvg ) models @xcite using the publicly available radex code @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the expected flux as a function of h@xmath92 density ( see figure caption for the adopted input parameters ) .",
    "three key arguments can be made from this figure .",
    "first , the rise in flux is nearly linear up to @xmath93  @xmath10 for co  ( 32 ) and up to @xmath94  @xmath10 for hcn  ( 10 ) , suggesting that these molecular transitions are good tracers of the density of the molecular medium up to these characteristic densities .",
    "the predicted flux beyond these characteristic values reaches an asymptotic value as the relevant lines become thermalized ( i.e. t@xmath95  t@xmath96 ) , thus predicting the gas densities from these lines alone becomes difficult in this regime .",
    "second , the predicted flux of co  ( 32 ) and co  ( 10 ) lines cross at @xmath97  @xmath10 ( i.e. flux ratio of unity ) , and the line ratio is less than unity for densities below this critical value .",
    "lastly , the temperature dependence of co  ( 32 ) is significant compared to the co  ( 10 ) line because the excitation temperature is higher in co  ( 32 ) . at low densities",
    "( @xmath98  @xmath10 ) , the observed co  ( 32 ) flux can vary by two orders of magnitude if the temperature of the ism varies from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "thus , at densities less than the critical density of the transition , collisional and radiative excitation both play key roles in populating the energy levels .    under the assumptions adopted for the lvg model used here , the observed variation in @xmath77",
    "can be explained in the following way .",
    "the low @xmath84 likely reflects the nature of co  ( 10 ) emission as a low density tracer , and thus the higher density gas in u / lirgs do not further increase the observed co  ( 10 ) flux , leading to the flattening of @xmath84 .",
    "the co  ( 32 ) emission is likely a tracer of higher density gas , but its flux is also sensitive to temperature , most notably in the low density end .",
    "therefore , the relatively large scatter in the u / lirgs and local galaxies in figure  [ fig1 ]  ( @xmath45 ) could be explained by intrinsic variation in the average gas kinetic temperature and density , reflecting the physical characteristics of each galaxy .",
    "the results from lvg modeling are qualitatively consistent with the theoretical predictions by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that because the excitation of the co  ( 32 ) line could be sensitive to temperature , less temperature dependent higher density gas tracers such as hcn  ( 10 ) or hco@xmath99 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see @xcite for a counter argument for the use of hco@xmath99 ) could be the better tracer of star formation in quiescent galaxies , although the gas must be dense ( @xmath100  @xmath10 ) enough to excite the hcn emission .",
    "these lines are also much weaker than co lines and therefore harder to observe ( see e.g. figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "while hcn emission is often used a tracer of dense gas feeding star formation activity , hcn emission from x - ray irradiated circumnuclear tori may become significant and therefore the hcn emission may be more pronounced towards agn than starbursts in some cases @xcite .",
    "in  3 , we have shown evidence that the overall co  ( 32 ) luminosity is well correlated with the total dusty star formation traced in fir luminosities . in this section ,",
    "we extend this argument and assume that the large scale spatial distribution of co  ( 32 ) emission is also correlated with the extent of current star formation .",
    "to this end , we have plotted the co  ( 32 ) emitting diameter ( in kpc ) against the fir luminosities in figure  [ fig4 ] . for the u / lirgs",
    ", a trend is seen where the co  ( 32 ) size decreases as a function of fir luminosity .",
    "the co  ( 32 ) size , however , can vary by an order of magnitude ( 0.33.1  kpc ) for the lirg population alone .",
    "in contrast , the ulirgs are predominantly compact ( 0.41  kpc ) , and the large fir luminosity seen in ulirgs is likely related to this high central concentration of high density gas .",
    "this trend immediately breaks down in smgs where the derived co  ( 32 ) sizes ( 316  kpc ) are roughly an order of magnitude larger than the ulirgs .",
    "the average co size for the smgs ( @xmath101 kpc ) is only a factor of two smaller than the average nuclear separation ( @xmath102 kpc)of the pre - coalescence lirgs ( e.g. vv  114 , arp  299 ; see also figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the three resolved quasars have source sizes ( 24  kpc ) that are systematically smaller than the smgs , but the sample size is too small for this trend to be conclusive .",
    "we caution that , although the smgs / quasars are observed with the highest angular resolution achievable with existing interferometers , these sources are only marginally resolved , and the resultant source sizes should be treated as a conservative upper limit to any internal structure present in these galaxies .",
    "the upper limits for the unresolved smgs and quasars ( see figure  [ fig4 ]  ( @xmath52 ) ) do not place very useful limits on their intrinsic sizes , but are generally consistent with the conclusions drawn from the resolved sources .",
    "these sizes show that the star forming regions in local ulirgs are much more compact than those in smgs .",
    "this result is an interesting contrast to the analysis by @xcite where they find that the millimeter or co size of the smgs themselves are much more compact than the optical size of the uv or optically selected population at @xmath103 .",
    "the widely extended ( as opposed to nuclear ) star formation in smgs was suggested previously using high resolution radio observations of spectroscopically identified smgs by @xcite who find 70% of sources with size scale of @xmath104  kpc .",
    "more recently , @xcite combined the radio emission data of smgs obtained using multi - element radio linked interferometer network ( merlin ) and vla in the @xmath81-@xmath105 plane , and found an average smg source size of 5  kpc , which is in agreement with the results of @xcite and also the co size measurements by @xcite .",
    "two - arcsecond resolution sma @xmath106 measurements @xcite of bright smgs suggest source sizes of @xmath107  kpc , and new higher angular resolution sma measurements suggest a smaller source size of @xmath108  kpc @xcite .",
    "thus , radio , co , and submm observations all suggest that the size scale of the brightest smgs are of order @xmath108  kpc , and this is a factor of 2  10 times larger than the co  ( 32 ) derived source sizes in u / lirgs .",
    "the average size of the smgs in our co ( 32 ) selected sample ( @xmath109 kpc ) is consistent with these numbers .      in figure",
    "[ fig5 ] , we plot the co  ( 32 ) diameters as a function of the co  ( 32 ) fwhm .",
    "roughly two thirds ( 18/26 ) of the source sizes for smg / quasars are only upper limits constrained from the observations .",
    "it is evident from figure  [ fig5 ] that even though the size scales of smgs are comparable to the nuclear separation of the widely separated lirgs ( i.e. + sign in figure  [ fig5 ] ) , the fwhms are on average 50% larger ( and a factor of two larger than those of the ulirgs ) .    the fact that both the average co  ( 32 ) sizes and the sfes are similar for the smgs and the local lirgs suggests that they may be in a similar evolutionary state , e.g. , that many of the smgs are in fact early or intermediate rather than late stage mergers . both the local ulirgs ( which are known to be advanced mergers ) and the quasars are more compact ( significantly so for the ulirgs ) and have sfes that are a factor of three larger than those of the smgs . in their analysis of several smgs",
    "observed with the best angular resolution , @xcite also conclude that smgs are major mergers in various evolutionary stages .",
    "they discuss three specific smgs ( two of which , smm  j163650 + 4057 and smm  j123707 + 6214 , are included in our analysis ) that each show two components separated by 8 - 25 kpc , which is more characteristic of earlier stage mergers of which local examples are arp  299 and vv  114 .",
    "given that most smgs are not observed at quite such high resolution , it remains possible that many smgs could contain relatively compact co reservoirs in two individual merging components , but not be sufficiently separated to be resolved with the existing data .",
    "however , this possibility would still be consistent with our interpretation of the smgs as predominantly earlier stage mergers , as the resulting projected nuclear separation of smgs would likely be as large as the widely separated lirgs in our local sample .    in mergers of two comparable mass galaxies ,",
    "the fwhm derived from the total co  ( 32 ) spectrum contains information pertaining to both galaxy rotation and encounter velocity . in principle , the encounter velocity of two comparable mass _ field _ galaxies in parabolic orbit is @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the encounter velocity and circular velocity , respectively . for local systems ,",
    "@xmath111 amounts to @xmath113  km  s@xmath14 at maximum . in reality",
    ", the observed @xmath111 is significantly smaller than this value , owing to , for example , projection and degeneracy in the merger phase , such as those seen in ngc  5331 ( @xmath114  km  s@xmath14 ) or ngc  5257/8 ( @xmath115  km  s@xmath14 ) . at first glance , the broad co",
    "( 32 ) linewidths of smgs (",
    "i.e. 600  km  s@xmath14 ) argue against widely separated mergers . however , a simple analysis that assumes two equal mass field galaxies is likely inapplicable here because the brightest submillimeter sources are evidently embedded deep in the proto - cluster potential @xcite .",
    "thus , the encounter velocity of these galaxies could be significantly larger than those of local field galaxies . for comparison ,",
    "a similarly large velocity dispersion is observed in the galaxy members of the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "the co linewidth can trace the underlying stellar as well as the non - baryonic halo potential @xcite , and the suggested average stellar mass of smgs ( @xmath116  m@xmath4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is significantly more massive than a typical field galaxy in the local universe ( i.e. the milky way ) .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the larger co  ( 32 ) fwhms seen in smgs are likely due to a combination of an underlying more massive dark matter potential and intrinsically more massive and gas - rich merger progenitors .",
    "analysis of numerical simulations @xcite have found that the co profile can display a variety of shapes owing to strong central outflows which could appear as secondary emission peaks in the co spectra .",
    "these simulations further predict that the spectral characteristics have strong dependences on the sightline ( i.e. the inclination of the source ) , as well as the mass of the underlying potential especially toward the latter stage of the evolution when the gas has settled in a disk ( i.e. quasar phase ) .",
    "in addition , the simulated co profile evolves as a function of merger age , where kinematic asymmetries are seen primarily in the pre - coalescence phase when the two galaxies have not yet merged .",
    "in contrast , the spectrum becomes closer to gaussian as the molecular gas becomes virialized and a quiescent molecular disk is formed .    while some of their adopted assumptions may not be best suited for analyzing the observational data presented in this study , these simulation results provide important physical insight .",
    "the narrower co  ( 32 ) linewidths , and the dominance of gaussian shapes in the quasar line profiles are consistent with the characteristics of a post - coalescence galaxy seen in simulations . in our limited sample of only three quasars , the size scale of quasars with robust size estimates",
    "are intermediate between the nuclear separation of pre - coalescence lirgs and the very compact ulirgs ( see figure  [ fig5 ] ) . given the factor of 10 larger average l@xmath1 in quasars compared to the local ulirgs , we might naively expect the starburst region to be larger in the quasars , which could explain the size difference to within a factor of two .",
    "alternatively , the quasar activity can begin in one of the progenitor galaxies earlier in the merger evolution than that predicted in simulations , and the abundance of co  ( 32 ) emitting molecular gas suggests intense concurrent starburst activity .",
    "it is also possible that co  ( 32 ) emission entrained in powerful agn jets can lead to an apparent increase in the co  ( 32 ) size of quasars @xcite .",
    "further , the observed narrower co linewidths of quasars may simply be due to an intrinsically less massive quasar disk @xcite or due to geometrical effects @xcite with quasars preferentially discovered in more face - on galaxies .",
    "it is , however , impossible to obtain a robust conclusion from our current compilation of data which is limited in sample size , sensitivity , and angular resolution .",
    "results from numerical simulations that include negative feedback from starbursts as well as the central agn @xcite suggest that smgs and quasars are not in the same evolutionary stage , but linked through dynamical evolution where the quasar activity becomes visible during the final stages of the coalescence .",
    "we have provided evidence in this paper that the co  ( 32 ) properties of many of the smgs are consistent with the widely separated lirgs in the local universe . a possible scenario suggested from these results",
    "is that smgs are widely separated gas - rich mergers taking place near the centers of massive halos .",
    "global disk - wide starburst activity in gas - rich high redshift mergers is also predicted theoretically by @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , some of the co  ( 32 ) derived properties in quasars , such as size and sfe , are more consistent with ulirgs than with lirgs or smgs .",
    "overall , the data summarized here are broadly consistent with this evolution scenario .",
    "finally , we note that there is a selection effect in play .",
    "there are interacting / merging galaxies in the local universe that are not u / lirgs ; thus , the triggering of the u / lirg activity also depends on the amount of pre - existing gas available in the merging pair .",
    "we also note that there are ulirgs that are in the early stage of the interaction @xcite , as well as lirgs that are apparently isolated ( i.e. ngc  1068 ) .",
    "there is also a case like the @xmath117 quasar ",
    "smg pair br12020725 , in which two submm bright sources ( one of which is a quasar , while the companion appears to harbor an obscured agn , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are separated by a projected distance of 26  kpc .",
    "the true evolution , therefore , is much more complicated than we envision in these simple scenarios , and sensitive high resolution alma surveys of smgs , quasars , as well as quiescent high redshift galaxies in a variety of evolutionary stages should reveal their true nature .",
    "lastly , the gas consumption time for smgs using the currently available fuel is estimated to be @xmath118  myr @xcite , and this is significantly smaller than the typical major merger timescale of 1  gyr .",
    "if the smgs and quasars indeed represent some stage of the evolution of a merger with sustained starbursts , then the dense gas must be replenished continuously in order to maintain a continuous burst of star formation throughout the merger evolution .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a detailed comparison of the co  ( 32 ) emitting molecular gas between a local sample of luminous infrared galaxies ( u / lirgs ) and a high redshift sample that comprises submm selected galaxies ( smgs ) , quasars , and two lbgs .",
    "the data for the local sample come from our recent submillimeter array survey of co  ( 32 ) emission in u / lirgs while the co  ( 32 ) data for the high redshift population are obtained from the literature .",
    "\\(1 ) we find that l@xmath0 and l@xmath1 are correlated over five orders of magnitude , which suggests that the molecular gas traced in co  ( 32 ) emission is a robust tracer of star formation activity .",
    "the slope derived from the log  l@xmath0  log  l@xmath1 relation is @xmath2 , and this near unity slope suggests that the efficiency of converting co  ( 32 ) emitting molecular gas to massive stars is , to within a factor of two , nearly uniform across different types of galaxies residing in different epochs . within the local sample ,",
    "the global star formation efficiency is lower in early to intermediate stage mergers than in the centers of more advanced stage mergers .",
    "smgs show lower star formation efficiencies that are comparable to those of the widely separated lirgs .",
    "\\(2 ) the slope derived for the l@xmath0 ",
    "l@xmath1 relation is significantly steeper than the slope derived from the same relation using the co  ( 10 ) emission .",
    "we show that this slope approaches unity for higher critical density tracers .",
    "further , we show that the co  ( 32 ) emission in the central regions of u / lirgs is , on average , nearly thermalized , whereas the outskirts are subthermally populated .",
    "\\(3 ) from non - lte lvg models as well as published merger evolution models that include radiative transfer , we argue that the co  ( 32 ) line is a fairly good tracer of star formation in smgs , where the star forming gas density is high enough that the dependence on temperature is relatively low . in contrast , l@xmath0 can show significant scatter when the average gas density of the medium is lower than the critical density , which appears to occur more often in widely separated mergers in our sample .",
    "the scatter in the l@xmath0 ",
    "l@xmath1 relation , therefore , reflects the characteristics of the galaxy ( temperature , density , and agn heating of dust in some cases ) , but over a large range of luminosities , the co  ( 32 ) line appears to be a good probe of star formation .",
    "\\(4 ) the co  ( 32 ) derived source sizes in u / lirgs show an apparent trend that the brighter ulirgs are systematically more compact than the less fir bright lirgs . the co  ( 32 ) sizes of the smgs are on average an order of magnitude larger than the ulirgs , and are comparable to the separation of the widely separated lirgs in our sample .",
    "the three quasars with robust size constraints have source sizes that are somewhat smaller than the smgs and a factor of two larger than the ulirgs .",
    "\\(5 ) the similarity in the co",
    "( 32 ) size and star formation efficiency between smgs and lirgs suggests that many of the smgs studied here could be intermediate stage mergers .",
    "the smg linewidths are , on average , much broader than many of the u / lirgs , and we argue that the large encounter velocity likely arises from the massive halo potential in a proto - cluster environment . in contrast , quasars have smaller co  ( 32 ) sizes and linewidths , and a dominance of gaussian shapes in the line profiles . these characteristics are consistent with those seen in post - coalescence galaxies in encounter simulations .",

    "<S> we present a detailed comparison of the co  ( 32 ) emitting molecular gas between a local sample of luminous infrared galaxies ( u / lirgs ) and a high redshift sample that comprises submm selected galaxies ( smgs ) , quasars , and lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the u / lirg sample consists of our recent co  ( 32 ) survey using the submillimeter array while the co  ( 32 ) data for the high redshift population are obtained from the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the l@xmath0 and l@xmath1 relation is correlated over five orders of magnitude , which suggests that the molecular gas traced in co  ( 32 ) emission is a robust tracer of dusty star formation activity . </S>",
    "<S> the near unity slope of @xmath2 obtained from a fit to this relation suggests that the star formation efficiency is constant to within a factor of two across different types of galaxies residing in vastly different epochs . </S>",
    "<S> the co  ( 32 ) size measurements suggest that the molecular gas disks in local u / lirgs ( 0.3  3.1  kpc ) are much more compact than the smgs ( 3  16  kpc ) , and that the size scales of smgs are comparable to the nuclear separation ( 5  40  kpc ) of the widely separated nuclei of u / lirgs in our sample . </S>",
    "<S> we argue from these results that the smgs studied here are predominantly intermediate stage mergers , and that the wider line - widths arise from the violent merger of two massive gas - rich galaxies taking place deep in a massive halo potential . </S>"
