    "no known solution for a coupled set of duffing oscillators exists , with the exception of specific cases .",
    "the duffing lattice is perhaps more well known as the fpu @xmath0-system , one of the systems studied by fermi , pasta , and ulam in the @xmath2 @xcite to numerically investigate the approach to thermal equilibrium in nonlinear systems .",
    "fpu found that the expected equipartition of energy among the linear normal modes did not occur , and that periodic , non - ergodic motion persisted even in the presence of the nonlinear mixing terms .",
    "subsequent investigations , both numerical and analytic , have shown that different parameter regions specified by the total energy and the strength of the nonlinear terms as specified by the parameter @xmath1 lead to markedly different types of behaviour @xcite , with the expected ergodicity emerging with increasing energy and @xmath1 .",
    "but the observation of the periodic motion in the orginal fpu @xmath0-system computer experiments lends credence to the possibility of finding acceptable pertubative solutions in certain parameter regions . that no exact solution exsists for a large @xmath3 - body lattice modulo some exceptional cases @xcite motivates us to develop pertubative solutions to systems of duffing oscillators .",
    "several pertubation schemes as applied to the duffing oscillator have been investigated @xcite , but the methods are applicable only in the weakly nonlinear regime and also require the time @xmath4 to be small in order to be rigorously trustworthy . we therefore apply a different perturbative procedure called the lindstedt series .",
    "we note that similar perturbation schemes that avoid secular terms have been proposed @xcite in the past . in particular , we note that the method presented here is a more general variation of the so - called shifted frequency perturbation scheme , as described in @xcite .",
    "the lindstedt method is a systematic procedure to compute formal power series expansions of quasi - periodic solutions @xcite .",
    "we consider an anharmonic bath of @xmath3 degrees of freedom in one dimension with fixed endoints @xmath5 , ( we consider these boundary conditions as opposed to periodic boundary conditions so as to avoid zero modes , which are problematic when using the lattice as a bath coupled to a test particle in the standard derivation of the generalized langevin equation ) as described by the hamiltonian :    @xmath6    the normal coordinates @xmath7 are related to the site coordinates @xmath8 through the transformations @xmath9 and @xmath10 where @xmath11 by means of this transformation , the harmonic part of the hamiltonian is decomposed into a sum of independent normal modes : @xmath12 where @xmath13    we have the following compact expresssion for @xmath14 expressed in terms of the linear normal modes @xcite :    @xmath15    where the coupling coefficients @xmath16 are given by @xmath17 with @xmath18 defined by @xmath19",
    "we seek solutions to the equations of motion for @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath1 is a small parameter @xmath22 .",
    "a hallmark of nonlinear , periodic behaviour is the amplitude dependence of the frequency . to capture this relationship ,",
    "for each normal mode @xmath23 we define a new stretched temporal variable @xmath24 where to first order in @xmath1 we define @xmath25 and the quantity @xmath26 is to be determined .",
    "the lindstedt method can in principle be expanded to all powers in @xmath1 @xcite , although the convergence properties for arbitrary @xmath3 and @xmath1 are not known . in this work",
    ", we will only retain expressions up to first order in @xmath1 in the quantities @xmath27 .",
