    "accretion discs are observed astrophysical objects which can transform a high fraction of gravitational energy to thermal energy and electromagnetic radiation .",
    "the fact of effective conversion of the smooth large - scale rotation to the small - scale dissipative chaotic structures indicates that the shear flows constructing an astrophysical discs must exhibit hydrodynamical activity , in other words , must be able to generate complex motions that strongly increase the shear viscosity , and cause the angular momentum transfer .",
    "furthermore , the numerous observations of variabilities in discs that already endure the action of the accretion mechanism imply that these discs may also give birth to non - stationary large - scale deviations from the basic flow .",
    "theoretical analysis of the stability of astrophysical discs and dynamics of various perturbations in them has been performing through decades . at present moment , however , the picture is not complete even for the simplest models of the shear flows .",
    "the same can be told about the linear theory when one considers a small perturbations only . in this case",
    "the obstacle is that the traditional eigenvalue approach to evolution of oscillations and waves in shear flows when it is assumed that the solution has the form of definite frequency fourier components @xmath0 has revealed to be ineffective while studying the initial value problems .",
    "it turned out that even in the flows which are stable in a sense that all perturbation modes are exponentially damping it is possible to set up such initial deviation from the background that it will be followed by a substantial transient growth of perturbations on the dynamical time - scale .",
    "mathematically , this is closely related to the non - orthogonality of modes in any physically meaningful metric space associated with them or , equivalently , to the non - normality of the appropriate linear dynamical operator .",
    "one of the first reviews on this subject has been done by trefethen et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and the studies of certain models were carried out in the framework of non - modal approach by butler & farrell ( 1992 ) , farrell & ioannou ( 1993 ) , henningson & reddy ( 1994 ) , hanifi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and many others .",
    "the necessary references can be found in book by schmid & henningson ( 2001 ) and in the latter review by schmid ( 2007 ) . among other things ,",
    "the so - called bypass mechanism for the onset of turbulence has been formulated .",
    "the concept states in general that the linear transient growth of optimal perturbations is a physical phenomenon responsible for the energy transfer between the large - scale motion and stochastic vortices .",
    "apart , the interaction between vortices themselves plays only a conservative role producing the stationary phase space distribution of vortices which is required to preserve modes taking part in energy transfer .    in astrophysical community",
    "the work by ioannou & kakouris ( 2001 ) paid more attention to new ideas on the non - modal approach in hydrodynamical theory of perturbations .",
    "the authors analysed the spectrally stable two - dimensional flow of incompressible fluid rotating with the keplerian angular velocity profile and showed that a stochastic external forcing in a form of white noise leads to the formation of strongly increased coherent structures that carry an angular momentum outwards .",
    "it fact , the first studies in the area were published yet in the 1980s but have been performed in a slightly different form .",
    "we are talking about papers by lominadze et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and fridman ( 1989 ) , where the local evolution of an arbitrary initial vortical perturbations was considered .",
    "the local analysis of an astrophysical disc dynamics has been utilized since the work by goldreigh & linden - bell ( 1965 ) . in that framework assuming the constant shear in the radial direction it makes sense to change to co - moving shearing coordinate system to implement calculations for the spatial fourier harmonics ( sfh ) of perturbations .",
    "thus , one analytically obtains the evolution of all possible initial perturbations and as well as the behaviour of their part exhibiting transient growth .",
    "let us remind that according to fjortoft s theorem ( 1950 ) the constant shear flow constructed of incompressible and non - stratified fluid is asymptotically stable since it has no vorticity extremum .",
    "we would also like to mention chagelishvili et al .",
    "( 1996 ) who proposed a qualitative explanation of the transient growth phenomenon and chagelishvili et al .",
    "( 1997 ) who discussed a peculiar transformation of vortical sfh to the sound waves . in the latter and several subsequent papers ( tevzadze et al .",
    "2003 , bodo et al .",
    "2005 , tevzadze et al .",
    "2008 , tevzadze et al .",
    "2010 ) in addition to the energy extraction from the background a new process of the linear coupling of sfh is examined .",
    "the linear coupling of sfh leads to the mutual energy exchange between sfh of different types that correspond to fluid properties involved in calculations , namely , it s compressibility and stratification in the radial and vertical directions . here",
    "we can draw an analogy to the well - known resonant interaction ( called coupling as well ) of modes in a critical layer where the pattern speed of modes equals to the angular velocity of the flow ( cairns 1979 ) .",
    "the local analysis in non - modal approach was also employed for different basic configurations by yecko ( 2004 ) , afshordi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , mukhopadhyay ( 2005 ) , mukhopadhyay ( 2006 ) , johnson & gammie ( 2005a , b ) , recently by volponi ( 2010 ) and others .",
    "let us note , however , that despite the clear indications of the substantial transient growth found for a variety of disc models in the studies quoted above the transition to turbulence through bypass mechanism is seriously questioned by comprehensive numerical simulations performed by e.g. lesur & longaretti ( 2005 ) , shen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , rincon et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , lesur & papaloizou ( 2010 ) .",
    "so the other ways to transition ca nt be excluded , for instance , by some kind of secondary instability ( see the recent paper by mukhopadhyay & kanak 2011 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the non - orthogonality of modes may become crucial in the non - stationary appearance of turbulent viscous astrophysical discs .",
    "the studies by e.g. umurhan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , regev ( 2008 ) and rebusco et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ( see also shtemler et al .",
    "2010 ) provide some evidence for that .",
    "they considered thin accretion discs with an @xmath1-parametrization of viscosity which revealed a high transient growth of perturbations of density and vertical velocity component caused by the specially selected initial oscillations of the velocity in the disc plane .",
    "note that in contrast to numerous investigations done in the framework of local analysis these studies involved large - scale vertical and radial structure of the disc .    in this paper we concerned with the global optimal adiabatic perturbations , i.e. perturbations exhibiting the highest possible transient growth in the fixed time interval .",
    "we would like to set up perturbations in thin non - viscous disc with a nearly keplerian rotational profile .",
    "a simple baratropic configuration of a finite radial size bounded by a free surface where the pressure vanishes is an object for our considerations . due to small corrections set by the pressure gradient angular velocity , @xmath2 ,",
    "will decrease slightly steeper than the keplerian one , @xmath3 , as the radial distance , @xmath4 , grows .",
    "lots of calculations by means of an eigenvalue analysis ( see e.g. kojima 1989 and hawley 1990 with references therein ) in such configuration show that it has an exponentially growing modes , though the increments become noticeable only for considerable pressure gradient in the flow when the rotation is essentially non - keplerian .",
    "present study is motivated by the previous work by zhuravlev & shakura ( 2009 , zs hereafter ) where the optimal perturbations were found for a similar two - dimensional flow with a power law rotational profile @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",
    "it was revealed that , first , the strongest transient growth was produced by the linear combinations of slow sound modes with a corotation radius beyond the outer boundary of the flow , and second , the transient growth intensified while @xmath7 , i.e. while the rotation tends to keplerian one .",
    "hence , we would like to examine the flows with an almost keplerian rotation what leads to a small @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath4 are the characteristic half - thickness and radial size .",
    "the smallness of @xmath10 makes it possible to find the disc sound modes analytically employing the wkbj scheme . as zs we will extract optimal perturbations from span of the linear combinations of sound modes .",
    "let us consider the axisymmetric flow in an external newtonian gravitational potential @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is distance from gravitating body and we will use the cylindrical coordinate system below @xmath13 . we confine ourselves to the case of perfect fluid and polytropic configuration with an equation of state @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the pressure and mass density of material and @xmath17 is the polytropic index . introducing enthalpy @xmath18 we write equations of motion for the rotating stationary flow    @xmath19    where in our model @xmath20 can be an arbitrary function of the radial coordinate @xmath4 .",

    "the relations ( [ stat_struct ] ) completely specify the polytropic disc where we are going to impose perturbations .",
    "the spectral problem implies calculation of definite frequency eigen - modes of perturbations for the specified stationary flow .",

    "derivation of ( [ equation ] ) has been discussed by many authors , see e.g. goldreigh ( 1986 ) , kojima ( 1989 ) , kato ( 1987 ) , one may also read a review by kato ( 2001 ) on the oscillations in thin discs .",
    "the boundary condition at the disc surface goes from equality to zero of the lagrangian perturbation of pressure , which in turn is equivalent to regularity condition for @xmath55 at the boundary    @xmath56    a complete solution of the system ( [ equation]-[boundary ] ) and the determination of the whole spectrum of disc eigen - modes is a challenge for anyone .",
    "an eigen - frequency @xmath57 is in general a complex number what corresponds to exponentially growing and damping oscillations .",
    "it is well known fact that either growth or attenuation of the particular modes take place only if the corotation point , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , is located inside the flow since energy exchange either between the modes and the background or between the modes themselves having the total energy of opposite signs is possible solely in the vicinity of @xmath58 ( for details look in the book by stepanyants & fabrikant 1996 and in the papers by papaloizou & pringle 1987 , narayan et al .",
    "1987 , glatzel 1987 with references therein ) the energy exchange in described by the resonant denominator in the coefficient of the basic equation ( [ equation ] ) , and the corotation point @xmath60 is it s singular point .",
    "the solution is multi - valued in the vicinity of that singular point what causes the problem of choice of a physically relevant branch what can be done according to the lin s rule ( 1945 ) .",
    "additionally , lindblad resonances given by @xmath61 are the removable singularities of ( [ equation ] ) but they are also of certain importance in perturbation dynamics .",
    "however , we are interested in the non - modal dynamics here so let us choose the part of the spectrum that will be easy to obtain .",
    "specifically , we consider the modes rotating slower than the flow itself , i.e. with a corotation radius @xmath62 . as was pointed out in zs that is these modes that are able to exhibit the most considerable transient growth .",
    "note that every such mode is neutral and have a constant total energy .",
    "we assume additionally that lindblad resonances are out of the flow as well .",
    "( the corresponding condition will be formulated below ) hence , in ( [ equation ] ) the term @xmath63 in coefficient in front of @xmath55 is large everywhere in disc .",
    "this implies that the wavelength of perturbations @xmath64 is small and comparable to the disc thickness @xmath65 .",
    "as it was shown by nowak & wagoner ( 1992 ) , see also kato ( 2001 ) , equation ( [ equation ] ) is separable in the lowest wkbj order into horizontal and vertical parts coupled by the slowly varying function @xmath66 .",
    "however , here we would like to do further simplification and consider perturbations with no nodes in the vertical direction , so that @xmath55 is the function of @xmath67 only .",
    "formally , this means that we require the maintenance of the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium in perturbed motion .",
    "this is of course a questionable requirement that artificially restricts our investigation especially taking into account that strict vertical equilibrium in the perturbed flow is possible for certain type of modes in case of isothermal vertical structure of the disc .",
    "so the general case @xmath68 should be considered in the subsequent study .",
    "thus , all mentioned assumptions allow us to use the wkbj approximation to determine the profiles of inertial - acoustic modes on interval @xmath69 .",
    "we first integrate the equation for small perturbations over the vertical direction obtaining    @xmath70w=0\\ ] ]    where @xmath71 are the surface mass density of the disc and enthalpy in the midplane of the disc correspondingly .    note that after a change @xmath72 provided that @xmath73 equation ( [ eq_3d ] ) coincides with the analogous equation in two - dimensional problem which arises if we assume that perturbations are localized near the midplane of the disc , i.e. if in ( [ equation ] ) all background quantities are equated to their equatorial values .",
    "this result was used to check the analytical solutions given below with the numerical calculations performed for two - dimensional problem in zs ( see also zhuravlev & shakura 2007 ) .",
    "then , for part of the spectrum we have chosen the inner lindblad resonance must be located outside of the flow , so that    @xmath74    what is followed by @xmath75 and the wkbj approximation gives an oscillating solutions .",
    "let us note that in the case @xmath76 the inner lindblad resonance is shifted to @xmath77 in the non - relativistic limit , consequently , disc settles into the evanescent zone for any arbitrary small frequency .",
    "thus , we only consider modes with @xmath78 .",
    "then , it is convenient to write the wkbj - solution in the form    @xmath79    where    @xmath80    @xmath81 and @xmath82 and @xmath83 are constants specified by the boundary conditions .",
    "note that following wkbj scheme we retain the terms in two main orders of @xmath84 proportional to @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "for that reason the first term in coefficient in front of @xmath55 as it stands in equation ( [ eq_3d ] ) is absent in [ wkb ] ) . since we may consider modes with @xmath87 as well ] for similar reasons combination @xmath88 entering ( [ wkb ] )",
    "is evaluated for a pure keplerian rotation .",
    "wkbj solution ( [ wkb ] ) is irregular in the boundary points @xmath33 and @xmath34 . on the contrary",
    ", we mentioned above that the regularity of @xmath55 at @xmath89 is equivalent to the boundary condition .",
    "let us change to new independent variable @xmath90 and rewrite equation ( [ eq_3d ] ) in case of @xmath91 .",
    "practically , we assume that all quantities in ( [ eq_3d ] ) having finite values at @xmath89 are equal to these values and approximate the disc half - thickness which vanishes at @xmath89 by the main term in it s expansion over @xmath92 getting @xmath93 where    @xmath94    in this way we get @xmath95 where @xmath96    the solution of ( [ eq_border ] ) which is regular at @xmath89 is the following    @xmath97    where @xmath98 .    since the denominator of @xmath99 contains small @xmath84 , at some distance from the boundary points @xmath100 while @xmath101 . in this domain",
    "we take for @xmath55 an approximate expression using the asymptotic expansion of the bessel function in ( [ solve_border ] ) getting    @xmath102    matching ( [ bessel_approx ] ) for the expansion of the wkbj solution ( [ wkb ] ) in the vicinity of @xmath33 and @xmath34 gives the zero phase @xmath103 and the dispersion relation    @xmath104    where @xmath105 is an integer number .",
    "thus , the profiles of modes are given by the expressions ( [ wkb ] ) and ( [ solve_border ] ) taking into account the following relations for constants @xmath106^{1/2}\\ ] ]",
    "in present study we utilize common procedure to calculate an optimal growth @xmath107 for a linear combination of modes ( for details see sect .",
    "3.1 zs and references therein ) . as in zs",
    "we measure the growth of perturbations by their total acoustic energy    @xmath108    where @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the euler perturbations of radial and azimuthal velocity components and enthalpy and the integration over the whole flow is implied .",
    "the slight difference in comparison with zs is that we integrate the energy density over @xmath112 what results in the emergence ( see eq .",
    "( 6 ) of zs ) of an additional factor @xmath113 in term @xmath114 and the volume density is replaced by the surface density ( [ sur_a ] ) .",
    "the metrics @xmath115 in the linear span of the particular set of modes is calculated numerically taking the analytical expressions for the dispersion relation and profiles of @xmath55 obtained above .    then , matrix of propagator acting on the initial perturbations is diagonal in the basis constructed of modes @xmath116 , where @xmath117 are the frequencies of those modes .    with the metrics",
    "determined we change to orthonormal basis where @xmath118 transforms into non - diagonal and non - normal matrix .",
    "it s norm squared equals to it s 1st singular value which is @xmath107 .",
    "an example of @xmath107 at time intervals of order of the sonic time @xmath119 and at the longer periods in comparison with the dynamical timescale @xmath120 is displayed in fig . 1",
    ".    also one can see there the evolution of certain optimal combinations of slow modes , @xmath121 ( see eq .",
    "( 10 ) of zs ) .",
    "we draw time in units of the keplerian periods @xmath122 on the horizontal axis .",
    "curves @xmath121 are associated with perturbations that reach the highest possible ( in linear problem ) growth at @xmath123 , when as it should be they touch with the overall curve corresponding to optimal growth @xmath107 .    as seen from fig .",
    "1 @xmath107 has a quasi - periodical shape repeatedly reaching the peaks and perturbations increase by many times at intervals of several hundreds of @xmath124 .",
    "clearly , this corresponds to sonic time - scale @xmath125 , and we keep in mind that even if there is a turbulent viscosity which switches on an accretion in disc the whole configuration evolves at the diffusion time - scale @xmath126 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the revealed transient dynamics in non - viscous rotating flow is possibly relevant to thin accretion discs at the intermediate time intervals in comparison with dynamical and viscous time - scales .",
    "now we are concerned with the redistribution of the specific angular momentum during the transient dynamics . with the help of savonije & heemskerk ( 1990 ) results",
    "let us write an appropriate expression for the angular momentum flux density of perturbations in the radial direction ( see sect .",
    "4 of work by savonije & heemskerk 1990 )    @xmath127    where brackets",
    "@xmath128 mean an azimuthal average .",
    "note that @xmath129 is directly related to another important quantity describing the evolution of perturbations which is the flux density , @xmath130 , of energy transferring from the background .",
    "@xmath130 is called also a reynolds force and @xmath131 .",
    "clearly , @xmath130 and @xmath129 have the same sign in our case , positive when angular momentum is transferred outwards and perturbations take energy from the background meanwhile ( the epoch of @xmath121 increase ) and negative in the opposite situation ( the epoch of @xmath121 decrease ) . also note that following the spectral analysis it is easy to show that for any mode separately @xmath132 in the whole range between @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "it is quite straightforward to calculate @xmath129 profile for optimal perturbations . in fig .",
    "2 we see how the shape of @xmath129 transforms during the evolution of certain optimal combination of modes associated with the moment @xmath133 ( when it touches the curve @xmath107 ) in fig .",
    "1 . the moment @xmath134 coincides with the local peak of @xmath121 in this particular case .    it turns out that the specific angular momentum alters at rate varying along the interval @xmath69 . more definitely , the highest angular momentum flux and the most rapid alternation of angular momentum density is always localized in some narrow part of @xmath69 .    as @xmath135 increases the mentioned domain of an intensive angular momentum outflow shifts from the inner to the outer boundary of disc .",
    "after the transient growth attains it s peak the abrupt turnover happens with @xmath129 so that angular momentum starts to flow towards the inner boundary .",
    "the latter result is expected since we are dealing with the nearly stable configuration .",
    "clearly , the domain of the most intensive inflow of angular momentum appears first near the inner boundary and then moves to the outer boundary .      in this section",
    "we briefly discuss the dependence of @xmath136 on the free parameters of the problem .",
    "they are the azimuthal wavenumber @xmath137 , the polytropic index @xmath17 , the typical half - thickness of disc given by @xmath84 and the radial size of the disc @xmath138 . besides",
    ", we have to fix the number of modes , @xmath139 , involved in calculations , i.e. the dimension of the linear span for perturbations we consider .",
    "however , the numerical tests show that a kind of saturation of the transient growth occurs as @xmath139 increases .",
    "in other words , as we include more and more modes the magnitude of @xmath136 stops to rise up noticeably from some value of @xmath139 . this",
    "is illustrated by fig .",
    "3 where we present the dependence of magnitude of the first peak at @xmath136 curve , @xmath140 , on @xmath17 obtained for different @xmath139 .",
    "note that this saturation upon reaching @xmath141 takes place for the model of zs as well .",
    "the polytropic index varies in the range from @xmath142 to @xmath143 what means passing from non - relativistic to relativistic gas in case of the flow with a zero gradient of entropy .",
    "we conclude that @xmath140 is almost independent of @xmath17 . in fig .",
    "3 are actually caused by the fact that while moving through the parameter space one has to adjust slightly the set of neutral modes to satisfy the condition ( [ neutral ] ) .",
    "as should be noted we always take the first neutral modes as measured by the distance of their corotation point from @xmath34 . ]",
    "then , in fig .",
    "4 we demonstrate how @xmath140 depends on @xmath84 which is the key parameter of our model .",
    "this is done for several values of @xmath137 .",
    "on the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "4 one can see also the curve of @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the time interval given by the condition @xmath146 . as we see @xmath140 increases inversely to the half - thickness of the disc what is consistent with the results of zs where the similar dependence on the mach number was presented .",
    "additionally , the substantial dependence on @xmath137 is confirmed here .",
    "precisely , @xmath140 is proportional to the azimuthal wavenumber .",
    "apart , the approximate duration of the transient growth given by @xmath145 alters weakly with @xmath137 . at the same time",
    "concerning it s dependence on the half - thickness one can find the relation @xmath147 corresponding to sonic time - scale what has been already discussed above .    finally , in fig .",
    "5 it is displayed how @xmath140 and @xmath145 alter with variation of @xmath84 for few values of @xmath138 . as we see",
    "both quantities grow as @xmath138 increases in agreement with zs .",
    "in this paper we reveal the significance of the linear transient dynamics concept in application to astrophysical discs .",
    "we point out that in contrast to the majority of studies in the area the global problem was considered , i.e. the perturbation dynamics was examined in the whole disc taking into account it s free boundary .",
    "moreover , we employ the approximation of thin disc with an almost keplerian rotation .",
    "the latter is quite important in astrophysics .",
    "however , several simplifications have been done to obtain the results .",
    "first , we neglect the viscosity in disc and assume it to be baratropic .",
    "then , we consider only perturbations that preserve the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium . and",
    "after all we make one more assumption taking the linear combinations of neutral modes only .",
    "we call these neutral modes `` slow modes '' since their corotation radii are beyond the outer boundary of the disc .",
    "nevertheless , even the oversimplified model shows that thin disc is able to generate perturbations with a substantial transient growth .",
    "further , to the contrary with the conclusions of modal analysis an optimal growth gets higher with the decrease of disc thickness @xmath148 , see fig . 4 and fig .",
    "5 . let us remind that sonic instability , i.e. an exponential growth of sound modes generated by a similar toroidal configurations ceases promptly as one passes towards the keplerian rotation .",
    "note again that the total energy of each neutral mode remains constant in time and azimuthally averaged radial component of angular momentum flux density corresponding to that mode equals to zero at any point of @xmath69 . but nothing like that belongs to the linear combination of those modes which exhibits a considerable growth of an acoustic energy ( see fig .",
    "1 ) accompanied by the increasing outflow of the specific angular momentum to disc periphery ( see fig .",
    "we find that the transient growth acts on the time - scale @xmath149 , intermediate between the dynamical @xmath150 and viscous @xmath151 timescales .",
    "this implies that optimal perturbations can grow up much faster than disc structure changes under the action of viscous forces causing a gradual diffusive angular momentum transfer .",
    "consequently , the transient dynamics phenomena can be important in accretion discs that already have an enhanced turbulent viscosity .",
    "though , one must keep in mind that in highly viscous discs the viscous forces should be allowed for changing the dynamics of perturbations themselves since their characteristic scale @xmath64 is small @xmath152 and the corresponding time - scale is comparable to the dynamical one .",
    "the latter suggestion can be treated as one of the ways to develop the present study . besides that",
    ", it would be possible to formulate problem on the stochastic forcing of the disc what was considered by ioannou & kakouris ( 2001 ) for their shearing flow model .",
    "note that we take into account compressibility of medium and the presence of the free boundaries . however , perhaps the more important development of the research is to include the vertical motions in the perturbed flow , i.e. to include the dependence of perturbations on the vertical coordinate .",
    "the results of rebusco et al .",

    "let us remind that we take merely the modes without the turning points ( lindblad resonances ) and the evanescent wkbj - zone inside @xmath69 .",
    "additionally , the nearest lindblad resonance is restricted to lie outside of the flow at some small distance @xmath153 beyond the outer boundary in order for wkbj scheme to be valid everywhere in @xmath69 and to match smoothly a wkbj - solution for an asymptotic expansion of a boundary solution close to @xmath34 , see above .",
    "however , the numerical tests showed that magnitude of the transient growth is sensitive to the presence of modes that have the mentioned lindblad resonance the most close to @xmath34 .",
    "that is why it would be desirable to include into consideration modes with resonances inside the flow .",
