    "millisecond pulsars ( msps ) and normal pulsars have distinct observed properties , and they inhabit two different regions in magnetic field - spin period ( @xmath3 ) diagram @xcite .",
    "normal pulsars have a spin period of @xmath4 and a magnetic field of @xmath5 .",
    "however , msps show some distinct observed properties such as short spin period ( @xmath6 ) , low spin - down rate ( @xmath7 ) , old characteristic age ( @xmath8 ) , and weak surface magnetic fields ( @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "about 75% msps are in binary system ( called binary millisecond pulsars , bmsps ) , whereas that is only @xmath10 for normal pulsars .",
    "at present , there exist two scenarios to account for the formation of msps .",
    "the first one is the recycling model , in which msps are proposed to be the evolutionary product of neutron star ( ns ) low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) or intermediate - mass x - ray binaries ( imxbs ) @xcite .",
    "the pulsar crossed the so - called deathline accretes the mass and angular momentum from the donor star that overflows its roche lobe , and can be subsequently spun up to a millisecond spin - period @xcite . during accretion",
    ", the magnetic field of the ns decrease to be @xmath11 due to accretion - induced field decay @xcite .",
    "when the mass transfer ceases , a bmsp consisting of a recycling ns and a low - mass ( @xmath12 ) helium white dwarf is produced .",
    "the discovery of the accreting millisecond x - ray pulsar sax j 1808.4 - 3658 presented strong support to this scenario @xcite .",
    "recent optical observations also confirm that there exists a transition link between x - ray pulsar and millisecond radio pulsar ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in another evolutionary channel , msps",
    "may be formed by accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) of onemg white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "when the mass of an onemg white dwarf reaches the chandrasekhar mass limit by accreting from its donor star , the electron - capture process leads to a gravitational collapse rather than a type ia explosion , and results in the formation an ns @xcite .",
    "for single stars , while this value can be @xmath13 in binaries .",
    "] if msps formed by the collapse of low field ( @xmath14 g ) white dwarf population @xcite , their magnetic field should be in the range @xmath15 g , and without invoking significant field decay .",
    "recently , the calculated birthrates by population synthesis approach indicate that the aic channel may play an important role in forming msps ( hurley et al . 2010 ) . as an alternative formation of msps , this evolutionary channel has been widely explored by some authors @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xcite argued that aic process of massive white dwarfs can produce sub - millisecond pulsars ( quark stars ) with a spin - period less than 1 ms ( or less than 0.5 ms ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to systemically explore the initial parameter space of lmxbs that could evolve into bmsps via the recycling evolutionary channel .",
    "in addition , we also attempt to examine if this channel can form the so - called sub - millisecond pulsar .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we describe the input physics that is necessary in the evolution calculation of lmxbs in section 2 .",
    "the calculated results are presented in section 3 .",
    "finally , we give a brief discussion and summary in section 4 .",
    "using a stellar evolution code developed by eggleton ( see eggleton 1971 , 1972 , 1973 ) , which has been updated with the latest input physics over the past three decades @xcite , we calculate the evolution of binaries consisting of a ns ( of mass @xmath16 ) and a main - sequence donor star ( of mass @xmath17 ) , and test if they can evolve into msps .",
    "the stellar opal opacities was taken from @xcite and @xcite for a low temperature . in our calculation , the ratio of mixing length to local pressure scale height was set to be @xmath18 , and the overshooting parameter of the donor star ( with a solar chemical composition @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ) is taken to be 0 @xcite .      with nuclear evolution ,",
    "the donor star overflows its roche lobe , and transfer hydrogen - rich material onto the ns . due to the high angular momentum , the accreting material forms a disk surrounding the ns .",
    "if the effective temperature in the accretion disk is below @xmath22 ( the hydrogen ionization temperature ) , the disk accretion should be thermally and viscous unstable @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the accreting ns will be a transient x - ray source , which appears as short - lived outbursts phase and long - term quiescence phase .",
    "recently , @xcite found that accretion disk instability model successfully reproduces the orbital period and the mass of the wd of psr j1713 + 0747 .    when the mass transfer rate @xmath23 is lower than the critical mass - transfer rate @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the orbital period of the binary , the ns accretes only during outbursts . defining a duty cycle @xmath26 to be the ratio of the outburst timescale to the recurrence time , . ] the accretion rate of the ns @xmath27 .",
    "otherwise for a high mass transfer rate @xmath28 , we assume @xmath29 .",
    "certainly , the mass growth rate of the ns should suffer the limitation of the eddington accretion rate ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the excess material is assumed to be expelled from the vicinity of the ns by radiation pressure , and carries away the specific orbital angular momentum of the ns .",
    "low - mass donor star would be braked to spin down by the coupling between the magnetic field and the stellar winds @xcite .",
    "however , the tidal interaction between the donor star and the ns would continuously spin the star back up co - rotation with the orbital rotation @xcite .",
    "therefore , magnetic braking mechanism indirectly carries away the orbital angular momentum of binaries .    for the angular momentum loss rate via magnetic braking",
    ", @xcite developed an empirical formula , i. e. @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the radius , @xmath33 the angular velocity of the donor star , and @xmath34 is a dimensionless parameter in the range of zero to four .",
    "this standard magnetic braking model is widely applied in studying the evolution of cataclysmic variables .",
    "however , studies on rapidly rotating low - mass stars with a spin period below 2.5 - 5 days in young open clusters show that the standard model overestimates the angular momentum loss rate @xcite .    in calculation",
    ", we adopt an induced magnetic braking description given by @xcite , in which the angular momentum loss rate is @xmath35 where @xmath36 @xcite , @xmath37 is the critical angular velocity at which the angular momentum loss rate reaches a saturated state , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the angular velocity and the radius of the donor star , respectively .",
    "@xcite proposed that @xmath37 is inversely proportional to the convective turbulent timescale of the star when its age is 200 myr , i. e. @xmath40 where @xmath41 hz , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are the convective turbulent timescales of the sun and the donor star , respectively .      in stellar evolution code , we also consider the spin evolution of pulsars as follows . with the spin - up of the ns",
    ", the accreting material would interact with the magnetosphere of the ns .",
    "we simply define the magnetosphere radius as the position that the ram pressure of the infalling material is balanced by the magnetic pressure of the ns @xcite . under assumption of spherical accretion @xcite ,",
    "the magnetosphere radius is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the surface magnetic field of the ns .",
    "some observations and analysis argued that the mass accretion of the ns can lead to its magnetic field decay ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "here we adopt an empirical model given by @xcite , i. e. @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the initial magnetic field of the ns , @xmath48 is the accreted mass of the ns , and @xmath49 is @xmath50 .    when the ns rotation is too fast , the gravitational force of the accreting material at @xmath51 is less than its centrifugal force .",
    "the centrifugal barrier would eject the accreting material , and exerting a propeller spin - down torque on the ns @xcite .",
    "namely , if the magnetosphere radius is greater than the co - rotation radius @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the spin - period of the ns in units of second , the propeller effect occurs .",
    "the spin angular momentum loss rate via the propeller effect can be written as @xmath54,\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the keplerian angular velocity at @xmath51 .",
    "when @xmath56 , the accreting material is bound in the magnetic field lines to co - rotate with the ns , and is accreted onto its surface . assuming rigid body rotation and the momentum of inertia @xmath57 , the spin - up torque of the accreting material exerting on the ns is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the gravitational constant , @xmath60 is the radius of the ns .",
    "in addition , if @xmath51 is greater than the light cylinder radius @xmath61 the ns appears as a radio pulsar . as a result of magnetic dipole radiation",
    ", the spin angular momentum loss rate is @xmath62",
    "based on the stellar evolution code and input physics described in section 2 , we calculated the evolution of large numbers of lmxbs .",
    "we take the initial mass of the donor star to be in the range @xmath63 ( with a solar chemical composition y = 0.28 , z = 0.02 ) , would experience a common envelope evolution , and evolve into bmsps with a short orbital period ( @xmath64 ) and a heavy co or onemg white dwarf . ]",
    "the initial mass of the ns to be @xmath65 .",
    "in addition , we assume that the ns is a dead pulsar , which already evolved to cross the so - called death line , and can not radiate radio pulses",
    ". the spin - period of a dead pulsar should satisfy @xmath66 @xcite , and the upper - limit of the spin - period for normal radio pulsars is 11 s @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that the minimum spin period of the ns is insensitive to its initial spin - period and magnetic field .",
    "therefore , we adopt an initial spin - period of @xmath67 s and initial magnetic field of @xmath68 for the accreting ns . if the donor star evolves into a he white dwarf and the roche lobe overflow ends , we stop the calculation .        in figure 1 , we show an evolutionary example of an lmxb with an initial donor star of @xmath69 = 1.5 @xmath0 , and an initial orbital period of @xmath70 = 1.5 day . due to the loss of orbital angular momentum by magnetic braking , the orbital period decreases from 1.5 d to @xmath71 d before the mass exchange . when the age is @xmath72 years , the donor starts to overflow its roche lobe , and mass transfer onto the ns commences .",
    "because the material transfers from the more massive donor star to the less massive ns , the mass transfer firstly occurs on a thermal timescale at a high rate of @xmath73 . at the same time , the surface magnetic field of the ns sharp decay to @xmath74 g. in the initial mass transfer phase , the lmxb appear as a short - lived persistent x - ray source . with the decrease of the donor star mass ,",
    "the mass transfer subsequently occurs on a nuclear timescale at a lower rate of @xmath75 .",
    "this rate is always less than the critical mass transfer rate .",
    "therefore , the lmxb should be a transient x - ray source about 95% of all its life .",
    "after @xmath76 years mass transfer , the ns grows to 1.63 @xmath0 . by gaining the material and angular momentum from the donor star , the spin - period @xmath53 of the ns continuously decrease to 1.8 ms . when the hydrogen - rich envelope of the donor star is exhausted , the degenerate he - rich core remains behind .",
    "the endpoint of the evolution is a bmbp consisting a recycled pulsar and a he wd with a mass of @xmath77 , and with an orbital period of @xmath78 .     and the initial donor star masses @xmath79 of lmxbs that can evolve into bmsps via the recycling evolutionary channel.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "the main aim of this work is to explore the progenitor properties of bmsps formed by the recycling evolutionary channel , therefore we have calculated the evolution of large numbers of lmxbs with different initial orbital periods and donor star masses . in figure 2",
    "we present the progenitor distribution of bmsps in @xmath80 diagram .",
    "the regions enclosed by the solid , dashed , and dotted curves represent the distribution areas of lmxbs that can result in a bmsp with a spin period of 10 ms , 20 ms , and 30 ms , respectively .",
    "our results show that all nss in lmxbs have a chance to be spun up to millisecond period , and the final fate strong depend on the separation of the binary . when the initial mass of the donor star is located in the range of 1.3 @xmath81 , the initial orbital period have a wider distribution from 1.0 day to 20 days .",
    "when the initial mass of the companion is between 1.0 @xmath0 and 1.4 @xmath0 , the system can not produce a bmsp unless the initial orbital period is less than 2.0 days .",
    "beyond these areas , bmsps can not be formed due to either a low spin - up efficiency or unstable mass transfer . for donor stars with a mass of 1.4 -1.6 @xmath0 , a lower mass accumulation and spin - up efficiency of the ns result in an upper limit of initial orbital period . however , for massive donor stars with a mass of 1.7 -2.0 @xmath0 , the upper limit on the orbital period originates from the dynamical instability of mass transfer @xcite . in particular , in our calculated grids there exist two binaries which can produce a sub - millisecond pulsar with a spin period of 0.9 ms .",
    "both lmxbs have a donor star with an initial mass of 1.9 - 2.0 @xmath0 , and an orbital period of @xmath82 days .     and the white dwarf mass @xmath83 for low - mass binary pulsars . the filled circles , the solid curve and the dotted curve denote our calculated results , the relation obtained by @xcite , and @xcite , respectively.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the evolutionary endpoint of most lmxbs is bmsps consisting of a millisecond pulsar and a low - mass he white dwarf , which is called low - mass binary pulsar ( lmbp ) @xcite",
    "stellar evolution theory predicts a tight relation between the core mass of giants and their radius @xcite . during the evolution of lmxbs ,",
    "the giant should overflow its roche lobe , and its radius relates to the orbital separation . when the giant envelope is exhausted , its core evolve into a white dwarf .",
    "therefore , the final orbital period of lmbps should be correlated with the mass of the white dwarf companion @xcite .",
    "previous works presented a simple relation between the orbital period @xmath84 and the white dwarf mass @xmath83 for low - mass binary pulsars ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) . in figure 3 , we show our obtained low - mass binary pulsars by filled circles in @xmath85 diagram .",
    "it is clear that our calculated results are consistent with the relation obtained by @xcite . to compare with observations , we summarize the observed parameters for 17 low - mass binary pulsars in table 1 . in figure 4",
    ", we compare the calculated results with the observed data in the @xmath86 plane .",
    "it seems that our evolutionary model can account for the formation of part bmsps .",

    "when the donor star mass is in the range 1.0 - 1.4 @xmath0 , only lmxbs with a short orbital period ( @xmath95 ) can evolve into low - mass binary pulsars .",
    "however , for a higher mass donor star , the upper limitation of the orbital period that can result in birth of binary millisecond pulsars is 2.0 - 3.6 days .",
    "our calculated results show that , if the ns accretes a mass of @xmath96 , it can be spun up to millisecond period .",

    "this result is consistent with the conclusion obtained by @xcite .",
    "however , aic evolutionary channel may produce a sub - millisecond pulsar ( or quark star ) @xcite .",
    "obviously , our evolutionary results depend on the parameterized input physics , especially the magnetic braking model , the duty cycle , and the magnetic field decay model , which have not been fully understood .",
    "firstly , the loss of orbital angular momentum plays a vital role in the evolution of lmxbs , hence magnetic braking model can influence the final orbital period of bmsps .",
    "secondly , the duty cycle can influence the outburst timescale and the mass growth of the ns .",
    "therefore , a large duty cycle can result in the birth of msps with a short spin - period . in addition",
    ", the duty cycle may relate to system parameters ( lasota 2001 ) , and may also evolve with the orbital period and mass transfer rate .",
    "thirdly , in our input physics the magnetosphere radius relates to the field decay model , while their relation is not sensitive .",
    "some uncertainties mentioned above may be responsible for the discrepancy between our simulated results and observational data in figure 4 . a large duty cycle and",
    "a weak magnetic braking model may produce bmsps with a short spin period ( 3 - 8 ms ) and a moderate long orbital period ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "certainly , if our evolutionary model is correct , there may be other evolutionary channel to bmsps such as aic process of massive white dwarfs .",

    "<S> the recycling model suggested that low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) could evolve into binary millisecond pulsars ( bmsps ) . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we attempt to investigate the progenitor properties of bmsps formed by the recycling evolutionary channel , and if sub - millisecond pulsars can be produced by this channel . using eggleton s stellar evolution code , considering that the dead pulsars can be spun up to a short spin period by the accreting material and angular momentum from the donor star </S>",
    "<S> , we have calculated the evolution of close binaries consisting of a neutron star and a low - mass main - sequence donor star , and the spin evolution of nss . in calculation , some physical process such as the thermal and viscous instability of a accretion disk , propeller effect , and magnetic braking are included . </S>",
    "<S> our calculated results indicate that , all lmxbs with a low - mass donor star of 1.0 - 2.0 @xmath0 and a short orbital period ( @xmath1 ) can form millisecond pulsars with a spin period less than 10 ms . however , it is difficult to produce sub - millisecond pulsars by this evolutionary channel . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our evolutionary scenario can not account for the existence of bmsps with a long orbital period ( @xmath2 ) .    </S>",
