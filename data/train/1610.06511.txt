    "networks are widely used to represent and analyze the relational structure among interacting units of a complex system . in the simplest case ,",
    "a network model is an unweighted , undirected graph @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a set of vertices that represent the units , or _ actors _ , of the modeled system , and @xmath2 is an edge set containing all pairs of vertices @xmath3 such that actors @xmath4 and @xmath5 share a physical or functional relationship .",
    "networks have been successfully applied in a wide array of fields , including the social sciences to study social relationships among individuals @xcite , biology to study interactions among genes and proteins @xcite , and neuroscience to study the structure and function of the brain @xcite .    in many cases ,",
    "the vertices of a network can be divided into groups ( often disjoint ) with the property that there are many edges between vertices in the same group , but relatively few edges between vertices in different groups .",
    "vertex groups of this sort are commonly referred to as _ communities_. the unsupervised search for communities in a network is known as _ community detection_. community structure has been used to identify functionally relevant groups in gene and protein interaction systems @xcite , structural brain networks @xcite , and social networks @xcite . as communities are often associated with important structural characteristics of a complex system , community detection is a common first step in the understanding and analysis of networks .",
    "the search for communities that optimize a given quantitative performance criterion is typically an np - hard problem , so in most cases one must rely on approximate algorithms to identify community structure .",
    "the focus of this paper is community detection in _ multilayer _ networks .",
    "formally , an @xmath6-multilayer network is a collection @xmath7 of @xmath8 simple graphs @xmath9 , e_\\ell)$ ] having common vertex set @xmath10 = \\{1,\\ldots , n\\}$ ] , where the edge sets @xmath11 may vary from layer to layer .",
    "the graph @xmath12 will be referred to as the @xmath13th _ layer _ of the network .",
    "we assume that the vertices of the multilayer network are registered , in the sense that a fixed vertex @xmath14 $ ] refers to the same actor across all layers .",
    "thus the graph @xmath12 reflects the relationships between identified actors @xmath15 in circumstance @xmath13 .",
    "there are no edges between vertices in different layers , and the layers are regarded as unordered so that the indices @xmath16 $ ] do not reflect an underlying spatial or temporal order among the layers .    in general , the actors of a multilayer network may not exhibit the same community structure across all layers .",
    "for example in social networks , a group of individuals may be well connected via friendships on facebook ; however , this common group of actors will likely , for example , not work at the same company .",
    "in realistic situations such as these , a given vertex community will only be present in a subset of the layers , and different communities may be present in different subsets of layers .",
    "we refer to such multilayer systems as heterogeneous as each layer may exhibit noticeably different community structure .",
    "complex and differential relationships between actors will be reflected in the heterogenous behavior of different layers of a multilayer network . in spite of this heterogeneity ,",
    "existing community detection methods for multilayer networks typically assume that the community structure is the same across all , or a substantial fraction of , the layers .",
    "we develop and investigate a multilayer community detection method called multilayer extraction , which efficiently handles multilayer networks with heterogeneous layers .",
    "multilayer extraction searches for vertex - layer sets @xmath17 , where @xmath18 $ ] is a set of vertices and @xmath19 $ ] is a set of layers such that the vertices in @xmath20 are densely connected across the layers in @xmath21 . the strength of the connections in @xmath17 is measured by a significance based score derived from a null random network model that is based on the degree sequence of the observed network .",
    "communities are identified one at a time , and need not form a partition of the network . in particular , identified communities can have overlapping vertex or layer sets , and some vertex - layer pairs may not belong to any community .",
    "vertex - layer pairs that are not assigned to any community are interpreted as background as they are not strongly connected to any other .",
    "overlap and background are common features of real networks that can have deleterious effects on partition based methods @xcite .",
    "we assess the consistency of multilayer extraction under a multilayer generalization of the stochastic 2 block model from @xcite for multilayer networks , which we call the multilayer stochastic block model ( msbm ) .",
    "the msbm is a generative model that characterizes assortative behavior of pre - specified vertex - layer communities in a multilayer network .",
    "we are able to show that under the msbm , the number of mis - clustered vertices and layers from the vertex - layer community that maximizes our proposed significance score vanishes to zero with high probability as the number of vertices tends to infinity .",
    "there has been considerable work in the area of consistency analysis for single - layer networks ; however , to the best of our knowledge , we are the first to address the joint optimality properties for _ both _ vertices and layers .",
    "the multilayer extraction procedure requires the specification of only one resolution parameter @xmath22 $ ] , which controls the extent of overlap of the final family of extracted communities .",
    "theoretical and numerical evaluation of our method reveals that multilayer extraction is an effective exploratory tool for analyzing complex multilayer networks . by accounting for the heterogeneity in each layer ,",
    "multilayer extraction can identify interesting and relevant community structure beyond existing detection methods . in this paper , we present empirical results supporting multilayer extraction s efficacy on simulated networks as well as diverse real - world networks , including arxiv citation networks and airline transportation networks .",
    "multilayer network models have been applied to a variety of problems , including modeling and analysis of air transportation routes @xcite , studying individuals with multiple sociometric relations @xcite , and analyzing relationships between social interactions and economic exchange @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite provide two recent reviews of multilayer networks .",
    "we note that @xmath23 is also sometimes referred to as a _",
    "multiplex _ network .",
    "while there is a large and growing literature concerning community detection in standard , single - layer , networks @xcite , the development of community detection methods for multilayer networks is still relatively new .",
    "one common approach to multilayer community detection is to project the multilayer network in some fashion onto a single - layer network and then identify communities in the single layer network @xcite .",
    "a second common approach to multilayer community detection is to apply a standard detection method to each layer of the observed network separately @xcite .",
    "the first approach fails to account for layer - specific community structure and may give an oversimplified or incomplete summary of the community structure of the multilayer network ; the second approach does not enable one to leverage or identify common structure between layers .",
    "in addition to the methods above , there have also been several generalizations of single - layer methods to multilayer networks .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite introduce multilayer generalizations of the standard stochastic block model from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , these generative models require the community structure to be the same across layers .",
    "@xcite describe a class of null models for multilayer community detection based on the configuration and expected degree model .",
    "we utilize a similar model in our consideration . @xcite",
    "considered the clustering of layers of multilayer networks based on recurring community structure throughout the network .",
    "@xcite first extended the notion of modularity to multilayer networks , and @xcite generalized the map equation , which measures the description length of a random walk on a partition of vertices , to multilayer networks .",
    "approximate optimization of either multilayer modularity or the map equation can be carried out by applying single network algorithms to a large graph formed by concatenating the layers of the observed graph .",
    "the communities that are identified by these methods form a partition of @xmath10 \\times [ m]$ ] , which in practice can be difficult to interpret .",
    "by contrast , multilayer extraction identifies densely connected vertex - layer collections , directly addressing multilayer networks with heterogeneous layers .      in the next section",

    "we conclude the main paper with a discussion of future research directions in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the appendix is divided into three sections . in appendix",
    "a , we prove supporting lemmas contributing to the results given in section [ sec : consistency ] . in appendix b",

    "given the degree sequence @xmath32 of the observed network @xmath23 , we define a multilayer configuration model , with probability measure @xmath33 on @xmath31 , as follows . in layer @xmath34 , each node is given @xmath35 half - stubs .",
    "pairs of these edge stubs are then chosen uniformly at random , to form edges until all half - stubs are exhausted , ensuring no self - loops or multiple edges are present .",
    "this process is done for every subsequent layer @xmath36 independently .    in the multilayer network model described above",
    ", each layer is distributed according to the configuration model , first introduced by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the probability of an edge between nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 in layer @xmath13 depends only on the degree sequence @xmath37 of the observed graph @xmath27 .",
    "the distribution @xmath33 has two complementary properties that make it useful for identifying communities in an observed multilayer network : ( i ) it preserves the degree structure of the observed network ; and ( ii ) subject to this restriction , edges are assigned at random , without regard to the higher order connectivity structure of the network .",
    "because of these characteristics , the configuration model has long been taken as the appropriate null model against which to judge the quality of a proposed community partition .",
    "the configuration model is most often associated as the null model for the modularity score of a partition in a network @xcite .",
    "consider a single - layer observed network @xmath38 with @xmath39 nodes and degree sequence @xmath32 .",
    "for fixed @xmath40 , let @xmath41 $ ] be the community assignment of node @xmath4 .",
    "the modularity score of the partition @xmath42 is defined as @xmath43}\\sum_{u < v \\in [ n]}\\left(x(u , v ) - \\frac{d(u)d(v)}{\\sum_{w \\in [ n]}d(w)}\\right)\\mathbb{i}(c_u = c_v = i).\\ ] ] above , the ratio @xmath44}d(w)}$ ] is the approximate expected number of edges between @xmath4 and @xmath5 under the configuration model .",
    "if the partition @xmath42 represents communities with a large observed intra - edge count relative to what is expected under the configuration model , it receives a high modularity score .",
    "the identification of the communities that ( approximately ) maximize the modularity of a partition is among the most common techniques for community detection in networks .      rather than scoring a partition , the multilayer extraction method scores individual vertex - layer sets .",
    "we define a multilayer node score , based on the single - layer modularity score , which is amenable to iterative maximization .",

    "this score is one version of the various set - modularities considered in @xcite , and is reminiscent of the _ local _ modularity score that was introduced in @xcite .",

    "large values of the score signify densely connected communities .    we note that the multilayer score @xmath52 is reminiscent of a chi - squared test - statistic computed from @xmath53 samples . that is , under suitable normality assumptions on @xmath54 , we expect the score in ( [ score ] ) to be approximately chi - squared with one degree of freedom .",
    "existing community detection methods differ widely in their underlying performance criteria , as well as the algorithms employed to identify communities that ( approximately ) optimize these criteria . as such",
    ", it can be difficult to compare the effectiveness of one community detection method with another , and it has become common to evaluate community detection methods through a theoretical study of their asymptotic consistency .",
    "the first work in this direction was that of @xcite , who investigated the consistency of score - based community detection methods in single - layer networks with a large number of vertices .",
    "consistency analysis has since been used to evaluate a number of community detection methods , including spectral clustering @xcite , modularity - based methods @xcite , likelihood - based methods @xcite , and aggregate community detection methods for multilayer networks with homogeneous layers @xcite .",

    "however , these methods identify on average of 4 or more non - trivial communities in each noisy layer where there is in fact no community structure present .",

    "next , the modularity matrix is calculated for both of the subgraphs corresponding to the previous division .",
    "if the modularity of the partition increases , these communities are once again divided into two disjoint communities , and the procedure is repeated in this fashion until the modularity no longer increases .",
    "label propagation @xcite _ : an iterative algorithm based on propagation through the network .",
    "at the first step , all vertices are randomly assigned a community label .",
    "sequentially , the algorithm chooses a single vertex and updates the labels of its neighborhood to be the majority label of the neighborhood .",
    "the algorithm continues updating labels in this way until no updates are available .",
    "fast and greedy @xcite _ : an iterative and greedy algorithm that seeks a partition of vertices with maximum modularity .",
    "the algorithm is an agglomerative approach that is a modification of the kernighan - lin algorithm commonly used in the identification of community structure in network .",
    "walktrap @xcite _ : an agglomerative algorithm that seeks a partition of vertices that minimizes the total length of a random walk within each community .",
    "at the first stage , each vertex of the network is placed in its own community . at each subsequent stage ,",
    "the two closest communities ( according to walk distance ) are merged .",
    "this process is continued until all vertices have been merged into one large community , and a community dendrogram is formed .",
    "the partition with the smallest random walk distance is chosen as the final partition .",
    "when used , we apply each of the above methods to the aggregate ( weighted ) network computed from the average of the layers in the analyzed multilayer network as well as to each layer separately . for each method",
    ", we use the default settings from the _ igraph _ package version 0.7.1 set in * r*.",
    "we now investigate several intrinsic properties of multilayer extraction by applying the method to multilayer networks with several types of community structure , including i ) disjoint , ii ) overlapping , iii ) persistent , iv ) non - persistent , and v ) hierarchical structure .",
    "figure [ fig : ext.sims ] illustrates six multilayer networks that we analyze for this purpose .",
    "each simulated network contains 1000 nodes and 90 layers .",
    "embedded communities have inner connection probability 0.15 ; whereas , the remaining vertices independently connected to all other vertices with probability 0.05 .      in the disjoint , overlapping , persistent , and non - persistent networks ( i , ii , iii , and iv , respectively ) , multilayer extraction identifies communities that perfectly match the true embedded communities . on the other hand , in the hierarchical community setting , multilayer extraction is unable to identify the full set of communities . in example",
    "v , multilayer extraction does not identify community 1 , and in example vi extraction identifies a community with vertices 1 - 300 across layers 1 - 60 , which combines community 1 and community 2 .",
    "together , these results suggest two properties of the multilayer extraction procedure .",
    "first , the method can efficiently identify disjoint and overlapping community structure in multilayer networks with heterogeneous community structure .",
    "second , multilayer extraction tends to disregard communities with a large number of vertices ( e.g. communities that include over half of the vertices in a network ) .",
    "the inverse relationship between the score and the number of vertices in a community may provide some justification as to why this is the case . in networks with large communities , one can in principle modify the score by introducing a reward for large collections .",
