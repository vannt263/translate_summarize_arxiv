    "one may investigate as well different aspects of spin - orbital interaction in the deuteron and can obtain important information about the role of `` non - traditional '' degrees of freedom ( like @xmath0 isobars , @xmath1 excitation and so on ) in the deuteron wave function .",
    "nowadays a renewed interest receives the elastic backward @xmath2 scattering with polarized protons and deuterons .",
    "a distinguished peculiarity of this process is that in the impulse approximation the cross section is proportional to the fourth power of the deuteron wave function ( contrary to the break - up and quasi - elastic reactions which are proportional to the second power of the wave function ) .",
    "this makes the processes of elastic scattering much more sensitive to the theoretically assumed mechanisms and the deuteron wave function .",
    "another peculiarity of elastic backward or forward @xmath2 reactions is that the amplitude of the process is determined by only four complex helicity amplitudes , and a set - up of experiments for a complete reconstruction of these amplitudes is rather possible . for this",
    "it is sufficient to measure 10 independent observables as proposed in refs .",
