    "( we refer to section [ sec : linalg ] for complete definitions of deletion and restriction ) .",
    "similar deletion - restriction relations hold for other polynomials associated to hyperplane arrangements , including the poincar polynomial and the two - variable tutte polynomial .",
    "in this paper we categorify these invariants , upgrading them from polynomials to homology theories .",
    "our constructions are modeled on the odd khovanov homology of ozsvth - rassmussen - szab @xcite which categorifies the jones polynomial of links in the three - sphere . in particular",
    ", the relation ( [ eq : delres0 ] ) becomes a long exact sequence in homology , as expected by analogy with the skein relation for the jones polynomial and the resulting long - exact sequence in ( odd ) khovanov homology .    the first part of the paper considers homology theories for unsigned hyperplane arrangements .",
    "these constructions are free from the restrictions imposed by isotopy invariance in the theory of link homologies , and as a result there is a lot of freedom in the definition of boundary maps between chain groups .",
    "for example , in considering categorifications of the characteristic polynomial , we see that essentially the same chain groups can be made into a chain complex using two very different choices of boundary maps . one choice of boundary maps gives a chain complex @xmath18 which essentially generalizes to hyperplane arrangements earlier work @xcite on categorification of the chromatic polynomial of a graph .",
    "a second choice of boundary map , however , gives a completely different complex @xmath19 , which turns out to be compatible with a multiplication defined at the chain level ; thus this second choice assigns a differential graded algebra to each central hyperplane arrangement .",
    "similar categorifications of the poincar and tutte polynomials are defined in the body of the paper .",
    "a deletion - restriction triple @xmath20 gives rise to a short exact sequence of chain complexes in all of our homology theories , though the resulting long exact sequences of homology behave quite differently for the two different choices of boundary map .",
    "the second part of the paper considers signed hyperplane arrangements , that is , arrangements with a sign assigned to each hyperplane .",
    "the motivation for the consideration of signed arrangements comes from low - dimensional topology , as a planar projection of a framed link in the three - sphere defines in a natural way a signed hyperplane arrangement . in low dimensional topology",
    "one considers link projections up to the equivalence relations generated by reidemeister moves .",
    "these moves , too , generalize to an equivalence relation on signed arrangements . in section [ sec : signed ] we construct a bi - graded homology theory for signed arrangements which is invariant under generalized reidemeister moves",
    ". the euler characteristic of this homology theory gives a reidemeister invariant ",
    "jones polynomial \" for signed arrangements .",
    "the precise connection to topology is that , when restricted to arrangements coming from projections of framed links , our homology theory yields an invariant of framed links .",
    "this invariant is quite closely related to the reduced odd khovanov homology of @xcite ; since theirs is an invariant of ordinary ( unframed ) links , a writhe - dependent shift is needed to recover odd khovanov homology from our bi - graded theory ( see proposition [ prop : oddkh ] ) .",
    "all of the chain complexes we use are essentially straightforward modifications to hyperplane arrangements of existing constructions for links @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , hyperplane analogs of link homologies seem both sufficiently natural and sufficiently interesting as to warrant further investigation .",
    "for example , the differential graded algebra structure on chain groups associated to unsigned arrangements does not ( as far as we are aware ) occur the polynomial categorifications of low - dimensional topology .",
    "moreover , hyperplane arrangements and their signed analogs admit a duality , known as gale duality , which greatly generalizes duality of planar graphs .",
    "the dual of a non - planar graph thus makes sense as a hyperplane arrangement .",
    "the considerations in section [ sec : signed ] for signed hyperplane arrangements are perhaps the most interesting in the paper .",
    "in fact , the gale duality statement for signed arrangements is cleaner than for ordinary arrangements , as there is an obvious isomorphism between the chain complexes assigned to a signed arrangement and its gale dual .    for unsigned graphs , rather than hyperplane arrangements , constructions distinct but somewhat similar to ours",
    "appear in the earlier works@xcite .",
    "a completely different categorification of the tutte polynomial for ( unsigned ) hyperplane arrangements was also given previously by denham @xcite .",
    "there are some fundamental differences between our approach here and his ; for example , the version of the tutte polynomial which occurs as an euler characteristic in our constructions has a rather different normalization than the one in @xcite .",
    "it would interesting to relate the constructions in this paper to his work , and to several of the other basic algebraic structures in the combinatorics of hyperplane arrangements .",
    "it should be possible to formulate many of the constructions of this paper for more general matroids ; a homology theory which categorifies the tutte polynomial of a matroid has also recently been investigated independently by a. lowrance and m. cohen .    finally , we point out that it is an old question to find a recipe that , given an arrangement @xmath11 , produces a natural bi - graded vector space whose graded dimension is the tutte polynomial of @xmath11 . in light of the categorifications of low dimensional topology , it is also reasonable to modify this question and search instead for a chain complex",
    "whose graded euler characteristic is the tutte polynomial .",

    "however , note that one can compactify the plane to obtain a sphere , then de - compactify by choosing the infinity point to be in an un - shaded region .",
    "this reduces the case of a shaded unbounded region to the previous case of an unshaded unbounded region , without changing the number of circles of @xmath686 or the number of components or faces of @xmath687 .",

    "there choices made when associating a vector arrangement to a link diagram were the choice of checkerboard shading for @xmath656 , the ordering of the crossings , and the choice of edge orientations for the tait graph in order to construct a vector arrangement from it .",
    "any of these choices lead to isomorphic chain complexes @xmath693 : the opposite checkerboard shading gives rise to the gale dual arrangement @xmath694 , whose chain complex @xmath695 is isomorphic to @xmath693 by theorem [ prop : galeinv ] .",
    "a permutation of the crossings amounts to a permutation of the vectors , and changing the orientation of an edge of the tait graph multiplies the corresponding vector in @xmath662 by @xmath165 .",
    "both of these were shown to not change the isomorphism class of the chain complex in proposition [ prop : smallissues ] .",
    "finally , @xmath692 was shown to be arrangement reidemeister invariant , hence by proposition [ prop : rmoveslinks ] it is an invariant under the @xmath429 , @xmath439 and @xmath447 moves of links , and also under @xmath657 since it is weaker than @xmath429 .",

    "however , in @xcite , bloom gives an alternative ( slightly more symmetric ) definition of a chain complex associated to a connected link projection , and he proves that the resulting homology is isomorphic to odd khovanov homology . it is a straightforward , if slightly tedious , combinatorial exercise ( which we leave to the reader ) to check that our boundary maps for a link vector arrangement agree with bloom s , this implies that @xmath705 coincides with reduced odd khovanov homology for connected diagrams . in turn",
