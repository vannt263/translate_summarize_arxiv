    "in the standard model of particle physics , all of the matter fields are charged under the gauge group of the theory , and consequently all of the particles participate in the gauge interactions .",
    "it is natural to ask whether there can be new particles that do not participate in any of the standard model gauge interactions , and whose fields are singlets under the standard model gauge group .",
    "such fields would be sequestered in a `` hidden sector '' where they participate in their own gauge interactions under which the sm fields are singlets . despite their minimal nature ,",
    "hidden sector models admit a rich phenomenology ; they have been well - studied in the context of collider physics @xcite as well as dark matter @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite we have pointed out that these models may also contain cosmic string solutions , called `` dark strings '' , that have novel interactions with standard model fields .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to derive the radiative and scattering properties of these strings . in a subsequent paper",
    "we will use these properties to study potential astrophysical and cosmological signatures of dark strings .",
    "the lagrangian for the hidden sector model under consideration is of the form @xmath1 the first term , @xmath2 , is the standard model ( sm ) lagrangian ; the second term , @xmath3 is the hidden sector ( hs ) lagrangian with @xmath4 a complex scalar field charged under a @xmath5 gauge group that has @xmath6 as its gauge potential , @xmath7 ; and the third term , @xmath8 is the interaction lagrangian with @xmath9 the higgs doublet and @xmath10 the hypercharge gauge field .",
    "the mass scale of the hidden sector fields is set by the parameter @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs field .",
    "the two terms in @xmath13 are called the higgs portal ( hp ) term @xcite and the gauge - kinetic mixing ( gkm ) term @xcite , respectively . for @xmath14 , the hp and gkm couplings are well - constrained , @xmath15 @xcite , but if @xmath11 is above the tev scale , making hs particles inaccessible at laboratory energies , the hidden sector model is ( as yet ) unconstrained . in principle",
    "the hidden sector can be extended to include additional fields and interactions ; we retain only the minimal degrees of freedom necessary to study radiation of sm particles from the cosmic string .",
    "the vev @xmath16 spontaneously breaks the @xmath5 completely .",
    "consequently the model admits topological ( cosmic ) string solutions @xcite .",
    "the string tension is set by the symmetry breaking mass scale @xmath17 , and we will use @xmath18 through the text .",
    "in we studied these `` dark string '' solutions , which were found to contain a non - trivial structure in the dark sector fields , @xmath4 and @xmath19 , as well as in the sm fields , @xmath9 and @xmath20 .",
    "( see also @xcite for the case when @xmath21 . ) in the decoupling limit , @xmath22 , the dark fields form a thin core of thickness on the order of @xmath23 , and the sm fields form a wide dressing with thickness @xmath24 .",
    "the dressing arises because the string core sources the sm higgs and z boson fields , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in the limit",
    "@xmath22 we can integrate out the heavy hs fields leaving only the zero thickness string core .",
    "in we found the effective interaction of the string core with the light sm fields to be @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the location of the zero thickness string core , and the rest of the notation is defined in .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath29 and @xmath30 have been derived in in terms of @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and other lagrangian coupling constants .",
    "we shall treat them as free parameters in the present paper .",
    "note that the interaction in is valid for @xmath22 , when the string core is much thinner than the sm dressing .",
    "if the core and dressing widths are comparable , the effective interaction formalism breaks down and the full field theory equations must be solved to evaluate string - particle interactions .",
    "the linear interactions given above arise because the higgs gets a vev , and the string acts as a source that modifies the vev .",
    "in addition , the string also couples to the sm fields through the more generic quadratic interactions . upon integrating out the heavy hidden sector fields , the effective quadratic interactions for the higgs and z boson are @xmath33 the quadratic higgs interaction derives directly from the hp term in , and we can estimate @xmath34 up to order one factors related to integrals of the profile functions .",
    "the quadratic z boson interaction results from the mixing of the z boson with the heavy @xmath35 field .",
    "the mixing angle goes like @xmath36 @xcite , and therefore we obtain the quadratic interaction in with @xmath37 .",
    "the w bosons will have a coupling similar to the z boson coupling in , and our results for the z bosons carry over to the other weak bosons as well .",
    "the remaining bosonic sm fields , the gluons and the photons , do not couple to the string worldsheet at leading order @xcite .",
    "in addition to interactions with @xmath25 and @xmath38 , the string also couples to the sm fermions due to an aharonov - bohm ( ab ) interaction @xcite . upon circumnavigating the string on a length scale larger than the width of the sm dressing fields ,",
    "the fermion wavefunction picks up a phase that is @xmath39 times @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the electromagnetic charge on the fermion , and @xmath42 is the weak mixing angle .",

    "2 .   in the physically relevant parameter regime , @xmath300 ,",
    "the dominant radiation channel is higgs emission from cuspy loops via the quadratic interaction , see @xmath301 in . 3 .",
    "the string loop also radiates gravitational waves from cusps , kinks , and kink collisions .",
    "the power output into this channel is well - known : @xmath302 where @xmath303 is the string tension , @xmath304 , and @xmath305 is newton s constant @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "if the string mass scale is large , then string loops will primarily radiate in the form of gravitational waves , as originally observed by .",
    "however , it is important to emphasize that particle emission will dominate if the scale of symmetry breaking is low , , for a tev scale string .",
    "for instance , taking @xmath307 to be the size of the horizon today we find @xmath308 .",
    "moreover , in general higgs emission dominates over gravitational emission for small loops : @xmath309 .",

    "we have assumed that the light sm fields are coupled to the zero thickness dark string core , which is composed of the heavy hs fields . as we found in ,",
    "the dark string has a much richer structure : the thin core is surrounded by a wide dressing made up of the sm higgs and z boson fields .",

    "additionally , as with most calculations of radiation from cosmic strings , we neglect the more familiar backreaction effect : a reduction in radiation power as cusps and kinks are gradually smoothed as a result of energy loss in the form of particle and gravitational radiation @xcite .    the particle production calculations that we have presented here play a central role in the study of astrophysical and cosmological signatures of cosmic strings .",
