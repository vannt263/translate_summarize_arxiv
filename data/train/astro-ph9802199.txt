    "since white dwarfs are faint for most of their evolutionary lifetime , their mass fraction in clusters and in the field is difficult to measure . yet the wd mass fraction is important both for the dynamical evolution of star clusters and potentially for the mass of the galactic disk and halo . even in the immediate solar neighborhood ,",
    "the range of the wd mass density estimates vary by more than a factor of two , from @xmath12 ( liebert , dahn , & monet 1988 ) to @xmath13 ( oswalt _ et al . _  1996 ) . while the solar neighborhood stellar density itself is poorly constrained , for a value of @xmath14 ( mihalas & binney 1981 ; and consistent with kuijken & gilmore 1989 , after subtracting the interstellar gas mass ) the wd mass fraction ranges from @xmath11 to @xmath9% . in the galactic halo",
    "the situation is even more poorly constrained , and the wd mass fraction is effectively observationally unknown .",
    "indeed , studies of gravitational lensing in the milky way ( e.g.  alcock _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) led to a flurry of papers during 1997 examining whether @xmath15% of the galactic dark matter could be in the form of halo wds .",
    "the bulk of these studies concluded that such a high halo wd mass fraction can be ruled out ( see gibson & mould 1997 , and references therein ) , but the mere fact that the mass fraction of wds is so poorly known drives speculation about its importance .",
    "for the clusters , the presumed source of the field wds , the wd mass fraction must depend on the cluster age and kinematical evolution ( e.g.  vesperini & heggie 1997 ) . in the last three years a number of studies have identified and measured the properties of wds in open and globular clusters .",
    "most of these new cluster wd measurements have been made possible by the ability of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) to detect very faint point sources and separate them from the many faint resolved background galaxies .",
    "these studies have been motivated by the independent information available from cluster wds on cluster distances ( renzini _ et al . _",
    "1996 ) , cluster ages ( von hippel , gilmore , & jones 1995 ) , and constraints on stellar evolution ( richer _ et al . _",
    "an important byproduct of these studies is the number and mass contribution of wds to their parent clusters . to the best of my knowledge",
    "no one has yet extracted this important information . in this paper",
    "i first tabulate the known cluster wds and estimate their fraction by mass in a handful of clusters .",
    "i then use a simple interpretive model supplemented by cluster dynamical studies in the literature to argue that the observed numbers of cluster wds are about what one would expect based on stellar evolution theory alone and are insensitive to the cluster dynamical history .",
    "finally , i discuss the relevance of the cluster wd mass fractions to the disk and halo field star wd mass fractions .",
    "starting with the nasa ads abstract service i performed a literature search on white dwarfs in open and globular clusters through 31 july 1997 .",
    "i included cataclysmic variables and other types of binary systems where the authors specifically discussed the wd nature of one of the binary components .",
    "my literature search covered 49 open cluster references and 82 globular cluster references . in assessing whether an object was a cluster wd , i assessed the likelihood of cluster membership as well as the likelihood that the object is a wd . for the globular clusters i required that the authors gave a high likelihood of the object being a cluster member and being a wd , although most of the globular cluster wds were identified purely on the basis of multi - color photometry .",
    "for the globular cluster photometric candidates , i checked that they had the appropriate colors and magnitudes for the cluster distances and that there were few , or no , field stars with the same colors and magnitudes .",
    "nontheless , especially near the limit of the photometry , it is difficult to judge the number of genuine wds identified . for the open clusters , where field contamination is much more problematical , i was stricter about membership probabilities and required that the authors used proper motions or some other criteria to evaluate membership and that the resulting membership probability was `` probable '' or better .",
    "the results of the literature search for open and globular clusters are presented in tables 1 and 2 , respectively . in both tables columns 1 & 2 list the names of the clusters ,",
    "column 3 lists the numbers of known single wds , column 5 lists the numbers of known wds in binaries , column 7 lists the numbers of wd members calculated to exist , and column 8 lists the total cluster masses in solar masses .",
    "columns 4 and 6 provide references to the previous columns , whereas column 9 provides references to the previous two columns .",
    "table 1 has two more columns than table 2 , and its column 10 lists the cluster ages in gyrs , with references in column 11 .",
    "the cluster masses are often lower limits and generally apply to cluster stars within some luminosity or mass range and/or within some central area of the cluster . for the open cluster ages",
    "there were often multiple references and i have chosen recent and representative values .",
    "nontheless , i represent the age range with the error bars in figure 2 .",
    "i assume that all globular clusters listed in table 2 are @xmath16 gyrs old based on recent hipparcos subdwarf studies ( reid 1997b ; gratton _ et al . _  1997",
    "; chaboyer _ et al . _",
    "this topic is discussed further , below , although precise ages are not critical to the results of this paper .    using the values listed in tables 1 & 2",
    "i was able to estimate wd mass fractions for four open clusters ( the pleiades , ngc 2168 , ngc 3532 , and the hyades ) and one globular cluster ( ngc 6121 ) .",
    "following is a brief discussion of how i arrived at each of the cluster wd mass fractions .",
    "the discussion is ordered by increasing cluster age .",
    "pleiades : there is one known wd cluster member with a mass of @xmath17 ( bergeron , saffer , & liebert 1992 ) .",
    "it is unlikely that there are any undiscovered pleiades wds since the proximity and youth of the pleiades makes any cluster wd relatively bright and easy to detect .",
    "it is still possible , however , that one or two pleiades wds exist as close companions to one of the brightest cluster stars .",
    "the total cluster mass is @xmath18 to @xmath19 ( van leeuwen 1980 ; meusinger , schilbach , & souchay 1996 ) . assuming the single known wd is the only cluster wd , the pleiades wd mass fraction is @xmath20 .",
    "the pleiades is 70 myrs old ( stauffer , hamilton , & probst 1994 ) with a main sequence turn off mass of @xmath21 ( weidemann 1977 ) .",
    "ngc 2168 (= m35 ) : there are two known wd members , each with masses of @xmath22 ( reimers & koester 1988a , b )",
    ". there are unlikely to be other single cluster wds , but the constraints on members of multiple systems are weak .",
    "the total cluster mass is at least @xmath23 to @xmath24 @xmath25 ( leonard & merritt 1989 ) .",
    "since both the wd count and cluster mass are lower limits , and both are unlikely to be more than a factor of 2 too low , i will assume that the ratio of the two is roughly correct .",
    "the wd mass fraction for this cluster is then @xmath26 , where i have increased the error estimate by @xmath27% to reflect the uncertainties inherent in the two lower limits .",
    "ngc 2168 is @xmath28 myrs old with a main sequence turn off mass of @xmath29 ( reimers & koester 1988a , b ) .",
    "ngc 3532 : there are six known cluster wds with a total mass of @xmath30 ( reimers & koester 1988a , 1989 ; koester & reimers 1993 ) . as is the case for ngc 2168 , this is a lower limit due to possible wds in multiple systems .",
    "it is also a lower limit in that only the central @xmath31 arc minutes of the cluster have been surveyed for wds .",
    "regardless , the total wd count is unlikely to more than double .",
    "the total cluster mass in the same central region is @xmath32 ( reimers & koester 1989 ) .",
    "i believe this is a weaker constraint than the wd count , and therefore the wd mass fraction is an upper limit of @xmath33 .",
    "ngc 3532 is @xmath34 myrs old ( reimers & koester 1989 ) with a main sequence turn off mass of @xmath35 ( reimers & koester 1988a , 1989 ; koester & reimers 1993 ) .",
    "hyades : despite the size of the hyades on the sky , it is near enough and its population has been well enough studied , that it is likely that all of its wds have been found .",
    "this includes seven single wds and three wds in binaries ( hd 27483 consists of two f6 v stars and one wd , boehm - vitense 1993 ; hz 9 consists of an m4.5e v star and a wd , and v471 tau consists of a k2 v star and a wd , white , jackson , & kundu 1993 ) . the total mass in these",
    "10 hyades wds is @xmath36 .",
    "the expected error in the total mass is smaller than the errors in the individual masses , which are generally less than @xmath10% .",
    "there are currently three more candidate cluster wds , but they are unlikely to be members ( reid 1997a ) .",
    "the total mass of the hyades was estimated by reid ( 1992 ) to be @xmath37 to @xmath38 solar masses .",
    "the hyades wd mass fraction is @xmath39 .",
    "the hyades is @xmath40 myrs ( perryman _ et al . _",
    "1998 ) old with a main sequence turn off mass of @xmath41 ( boehm - vitense 1993 ) .",
    "ngc 6121 (= m4 ) : because of the distance and age of ngc 6121 current observations sample only the brighter portion of the wd cooling sequence , with the faintest wds expected at v @xmath42 . additionally , to reach even the brighter wds in ngc 6121 requires the hubble space telescope , and so observations cover only a small part of the cluster field .",
    "although the wd mass fraction can not be estimated directly , as done ( above ) for open clusters , it can still be derived by counting the number of horizontal branch stars and knowing their evolutionary lifetime in comparison to the lifetime of the cluster wds ( essentially the lifetime of the cluster ) .",
    "richer _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1995 ) used this technique and estimated that the number of wds expected in ngc 6121 is @xmath43 .",
    "no error estimates were given , so i assume an error of @xmath44 . among the more than @xmath45 wds that richer _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1997 ) find in ngc 6121 , they estimate a mean mass of @xmath46 . since the observable ( i.e.  brighter ) wds are strongly weighted to those that have evolved off the main sequence in the last @xmath47 gyrs",
    ", i make the small correction to @xmath48 as the mean cluster wd mass .",
    "modern mass estimates for ngc 6121 based on dynamical models range from @xmath49 ( peterson , rees , & cudworth 1995 ) to @xmath50 ( sigurdsson 1993 ) .",
    "i take the mean of these two estimates and use the range as the error estimate : @xmath51 .",
    "the ngc 6121 wd mass fraction is @xmath52 . for ngc 6121 , as well as the rest of the globular clusters listed in table 2 ,",
    "i assume ages of @xmath53 gyrs ( reid 1997b ; gratton _ et al . _  1997",
    "; chaboyer _ et al . _",
    "although these ages are still a topic of debate , figures 2 and 3 demonstrate that the wd mass fraction loses age sensitivity well before @xmath54 gyrs .",
    "the main sequence turn off mass is globular clusters is @xmath55 .",
    "the wd mass fractions for the four open clusters and one globular cluster support a general picture of an increasing wd mass fraction from @xmath56% at an age of approximately @xmath57 myrs ( pleiades , ngc 2168 , ngc 3532 ) to @xmath58% by @xmath59 gyr ( hyades ) to @xmath60% by @xmath0 gyrs ( ngc 6121 ) .",
    "how reasonable is such an interpretation ? to fully address this question would require a comparison of the data to detailed cluster models that fully incorporate stellar evolution and cluster dynamics .",
    "vesperini & heggie ( 1997 ) have created just such model globular clusters using a sophisticated n - body treatment incorporating stellar evolution and they even explicitly followed the cluster wd mass fractions .",
    "terlevich ( 1987 ) and de la feunte marcos ( 1996 ) used similar theoretical treatments to investigate the general evolution of open clusters , though they did not specifically investigate the evolution of the wd mass fraction . since the currently available theoretical results do not cover the entire range of cluster ages and physical parameters , i will tie together the open cluster and globular cluster data with a simple interpretive model that incorporates only the effects of stellar evolution and not dynamical evolution . to correct for the effects of dynamical evolution i will , where possible , use the results of the above - mentioned theoretical studies .",
    "i assume all open and globular clusters were created in a single burst star formation event and that their initial mass functions ( imfs ) can be characterized by a single or a double power law of the form    @xmath61    over the mass range @xmath62 .",
    "current hst work on globular clusters ( piotto 1997 ) that are thought to have suffered little stellar evaporation is consistent with a single power law mf up to the present - day turn - off mass , @xmath55 , at least at the precision necessary for calculating wd numbers .",
    "i consider a range of single power law imf slopes , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , and one double power law imf slope , @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 otherwise .",
    "the double power law imf is essentially the galactic disk mf given by gould , bahcall , & flynn ( 1997 ) . on this system ,",
    "the slope of @xmath68 is the salpeter ( 1955 ) value .",
    "stars evolve from the zero age main sequence through the asymptotic giant branch on timescales given by the stellar evolution parameterizations of eggleton , fitchett , & tout ( 1989 ) and tout _ et al . _  ( 1997 ) .",
    "while the parameterizations used here are all for solar metallicity stars , the differential effect on the wd mass fractions is slight , with only a small difference in the turn off mass as a function of metallicity affecting the overall mass in main sequence stars .",
    "white dwarfs are produced from post asymptotic giant branch stars via the initial  final mass relation .",
    "i have tried two different initial  final mass relations ; one given by von hippel , bothun , & schommer ( 1997 ) based on the data compiled by weidemann & koester ( 1983 ) ,    @xmath69    and the other the `` standard model '' parameterization of wood ( 1992 ) ,    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the zero - age main sequence mass and @xmath72 is the mass of the resulting white dwarf , both in solar masses .",
    "although these two parameterizations are different , with the wood standard model parameterization being nearly a straight line , they yield essentially the same results since the imf and stellar evolution lifetimes are the main determinants of the wd mass fractions .",
    "this is encouraging since even if the initial  final mass relation is different at globular cluster metallicities , it is unlikely to significantly alter the wd mass fractions .    the highest mass main sequence star that forms a wd is most likely @xmath73 ( koester & reimers 1996 ) .",
    "there is some question , however , whether this upper mass limit varies , depending perhaps on stellar abundances or rotation ( weidemann 1977 ) , and it may be as low as @xmath74 in some clusters . both of these upper mass limits are used in this model .",
    "all gas ejected from evolving stars and all neutron stars and black hole remnants are assumed to leave the cluster .",
    "globular cluster gas masses have been shown to be negligible ( krockenberger & grindlay 1995 , and references therein ) , and the number of detected neutron stars is small enough ( e.g.  manchester _ et al . _  1991 ) and",
    "neutron star kicks are expected to be high enough ( e.g.  helfand , taylor , & manchester 1977 ) , that most neutron stars should leave the cluster .",
    "the model does not include binary stars .",
    "open clusters are known to have a large number of binaries while globular clusters have binary fractions typically @xmath75% ( e.g.  richer _ et al . _",
    "the challenge in comparing this simple model to the clusters is to observationally correct for binaries in the open clusters .",
    "it does not matter , for instance , that this model would not predict cluster cataclysmic variables .",
    "the key point is to predict the expected mass fraction of wds as a function of stellar population age .",
    "finally , as discussed above , cluster kinematical evolution is not incorporated .",
    "figure 1 shows the fraction of mass lost from the model clusters as a function of age , up to @xmath5 gyrs , for imfs characterized by slopes @xmath76 ( salpeter 1955 ) , and @xmath64 .",
    "a double power - law slope case is also plotted with @xmath65 above @xmath77 and @xmath67 otherwise ( as advocated gould , bahcall , & flynn ( 1997 ) for the galactic disk field stars ) .",
    "the dashed lines are for model runs with @xmath78 and the solid lines are for model runs with @xmath79 . in this figure ,",
    "the two different initial  final mass relations ( equations 2 and 3 ) would be indistinguishable , and so only model runs based on the quadratic initial  final mass relation ( equation 2 ) are plotted .",
    "clearly imf slopes as flat as @xmath80 or @xmath81 would cause the cluster to evaporate ( see also terlevich 1987 ) .",
    "even with slopes near the salpeter value , much of the initial cluster mass is lost and it is essential to keep track of mass loss , since it is significant enough to affect the total cluster mass , and hence any calculated wd mass fractions .",
    "figure 2 shows the wd mass fraction for the model clusters as a function of the imf slope , for @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "again the model runs show only the results from the quadratic initial  final mass relation as the results for the exponential initial  final mass relation differed by only @xmath80 to @xmath11% , depending on the imf slope , @xmath84 , and age .",
    "( the difference is always @xmath85% for a salpeter imf slope . )",
    "also plotted are the four open cluster and one globular cluster wd mass fractions , along with their 1 @xmath86 uncertainties . in order to make the hyades and ngc 6121 data points visible ,",
    "the @xmath87 and @xmath81 model runs are not plotted in their entirety .",
    "figure 3 is similar to figure 2 except that both axes are plotted as logarithms .",
    "the model imf slopes are the same as in figure 2 .",
    "the onset of wd creation for @xmath88 near log(age ) = @xmath89 gyrs and for @xmath82 near log(age ) = @xmath90 gyrs can be simply understood as the stellar evolutionary lifetimes for @xmath2 and @xmath10 solar mass stars . the arrow symbol near log(age ) = @xmath91 gyrs is the upper limit value for ngc 3532 .",
    "it is clear from figures 2 and 3 that the wd mass fractions for the four open clusters and one globular cluster are roughly consistent with an imf with a salpeter - like slope .",
    "for the two youngest open clusters , i.e.  those with ages less than 100 myrs , the wd mass fractions display perhaps more sensitivity to the exact value of @xmath84 than to the imf slope .",
    "additionally , even if clusters imfs can be fit by power laws , the number of high mass stars is likely to be small and should stochastically vary .",
    "the wd mass fractions for a few representative old stellar populations are listed in table 3 .",
    "column 1 lists the population age in gyrs , and columns 2 through 5 list the wd mass fractions for four different imf slope and @xmath84 combinations , as labeled .",
    "the wd mass fractions range from @xmath8% to @xmath6% and are relatively insensitive to @xmath84 and age .",
    "the primary sensitivity at these ages is to the imf slope .",
    "kinematical evolution causes mass segregation and stellar evaporation .",
    "mass segregation alone is not expected to cause significant problems for my simple model since observations of open clusters often cover the entire cluster and observations of globular clusters are generally made near a few core radii ( e.g.  de marchi & paresce 1995a , 1995b ) where king models ( e.g.  cool , piotto , & king 1996 ) and n - body simulations ( vesperini & heggie 1997 ) have consistently shown that the present - day mfs ( pdmfs ) are very similar to the global mf . generally , under a number of conditions relevant to the distant globular clusters , these global mfs are very similar to the imf ( vesperini & heggie 1997 ) .",
    "for example , according to equation 16 of vesperini & heggie ( 1997 ) , even for a globular cluster with @xmath92 kpc , @xmath93 , and age @xmath94 gyrs , an imf slope @xmath95 population should be very similar to the pdmf , which would have @xmath96 .",
    "globular clusters that spend their time nearer the galactic center were not modeled by vesperini & heggie , although the general trend for such clusters is preferential loss of low mass stars due to disk shocking and tidal stripping .",
    "ngc 6121 has @xmath97 kpc ( peterson , rees , & cudworth 1995 ) and it is somewhat surprising that it still exists .",
    "nontheless , it does exist , and its low mass stars exhibit a mf slope @xmath98 ( richer 1997 ) . for this pdmf slope the wd mass fraction should be little affected by stellar evaporation .",
    "i conclude that despite the probably large amount of stellar evaporation this cluster has suffered , its kinematical evolution should not have significantly altered the wd mass fraction .",
    "although counter - intuitive , stellar evaporation in open clusters may not preferentially eject low mass stars since mass segregation spares the low mass members many encounters , particularly with the oft - produced central massive binary system ( terlevich 1987 ) .",
    "it is not yet clear , however , what the relative evaporation of wds versus the entire range of main sequence stars is expected to be .",
    "et al . _  ( 1992 ) tried to address this problem specifically for the hyades .",
    "they argued that extrapolation of the hyades pdmf up to @xmath83 would predict at least 21 more cluster wds than currently reside in the hyades ( seven single wds and three in binaries ) . additionally , the coolest of the known hyades wds has a cooling age of 300 myrs , about half the cluster age .",
    "they argued that all the missing wds were the older ones , which have had time to escape , and which perhaps had their velocities augmented by asymmetric mass loss during planetary nebulae ejection or dissolution of their precursor binary . to address how the hyades might dissolve they numerically integrated test particles in representative galactic orbits .",
    "they concluded that evaporation of light stars in the hyades has reduced the original population by a factor of perhaps ten . while weidemann _",
    "_  did not specifically say how the hyades wd mass fraction might evolve , their numbers indicate that despite a near dissolution of the hyades , the wd mass fraction should not have changed by more than a factor of two .",
    "even if @xmath99% of the original hyades stars have been lost , if they were preferentially low mass members , less than @xmath99% of the cluster mass would have been lost .",
    "this number compares closely with the @xmath100% fraction of wds lost ( currently @xmath101 , formerly more than @xmath102 ) .",
    "although the other three open clusters presented in figures 2 and 3 have not been individually treated by theoretical studies , some guidance can be gained by the work of de la feunte marcos ( 1996 ) .",
    "his n - body open cluster simulations disrupted after an average of @xmath103 myrs for n = @xmath104 particles .",
    "the disruption time increased with the number of cluster members .",
    "all three of these open clusters are about 115 myrs old ( the pleiades is @xmath105 myrs old , ngc 2168 is @xmath106 myrs old , and ngc 3532 is @xmath107 myrs old ) , yet all three were born with significantly more than @xmath104 stars ( see table 1 ) .",
    "these clusters not only still do exist , but they should still exist , and their stellar evaporation losses should not be catastrophic .",
    "thus , by analogy with the hyades which seems to have approximately retained its wd mass fraction despite stellar evaporation , these three younger open clusters should be even less affected by stellar evaporation .    in summary , for the particular clusters studied here",
    ", kinematical evolution has been moderate ( the pleiades , ngc 2168 , and ngc 3532 ) to strong ( the hyades and ngc 6121 ) .",
    "_ nevertheless , kinematical evolution has little changed the wd mass fractions in these five clusters .",
    "all five clusters have approximately the wd mass fraction that would be produced by a stellar populations with a salpeter - like imf . _",
    "the insensitivity of the wd mass fraction to the cluster dynamical history is due to the fact that most wds have masses intermediate between the top and bottom of the present main sequence in every cluster .",
    "how similar are the cluster wd mass fractions to those of the galactic disk and halo ?",
    "the essence of the question is how similar the field star imf is to that of the observed clusters . for the open clusters and the galactic disk ,",
    "the expectation is that the imfs should be essentially the same since current work on star - forming complexes ( hillenbrand _ et al . _",
    "1993 ; hillenbrand 1997 ) , on open clusters ( e.g. reid 1992 ; von hippel _",
    "et al . _",
    "1996 ) , and on the disk field population ( e.g.  gould , bahcall , & flynn 1997 ) all yield similar mass functions .",
    "while the disk field population includes stars of all ages , most studies of the galactic star formation history ( e.g.  twarog 1980 ; pardi & ferrini 1994 ) have concluded that the rate of star formation in the disk has been falling somewhat with time .",
    "thus , the median stellar age of the disk is likely to be greater than half the disk age . assuming a disk age of @xmath0 gyrs ( winget _ et al . _",
    "1987 ; liebert , dahn , & monet 1988 ; oswalt _ et al . _",
    "1996 ) then for a median disk star age of @xmath10 to @xmath9 gyrs and @xmath4 ( see table 3 ) , the galactic disk wd mass fraction should be @xmath8 to @xmath9% .",
    "this number is consistent with the empirical estimate of @xmath11 to @xmath9% ( liebert , dahn , & monet 1988 ; oswalt _ et al . _",
    "1996 ) .    for the globular clusters and the galactic halo the situation is much less clear , even though a few globular cluster luminosity functions have now been measured to luminosities equivalent to nearly @xmath108 ( e.g.  de marchi & paresce 1995a , b ; elson _ et al . _  1995",
    "; cool , piotto , & king 1996 ) .",
    "the greatest current difficulty is measuring the halo luminosity function , which is presently poorly known and controversial .",
    "nontheless , the theoretical cluster simulations can again act as a guide .",
    "consistently , larger clusters and clusters with steeper imfs survive longer .",
    "thus , the halo field star population was likely produced by clusters that were smaller and/or had a flatter imf .",
    "the halo field imf should not be too much flatter than the cluster imfs however , or it would violate a number of nucleosynthesis constraints ( see gibson & mould 1997 , and references therein ) .",
    "assuming the galactic halo is @xmath1 gyrs old ( reid 1997b ; gratton _ et al . _  1997 ;",
    "chaboyer _ et al . _",
    "1998 ) , it should contain @xmath2 to @xmath3% ( @xmath4 ) or perhaps as much as @xmath5 to @xmath6% ( @xmath7 ) of its stellar mass in the form of wds ( see figure 2 and table 3 ) .    continued observations of globular clusters and the next generation of combined n - body and stellar evolution models",
    "( tout _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) should refine both our estimates of the wd mass fraction and the relationship between the cluster and the field star imfs .",
    "it would be of particular interest to know if the disk and halo field star imfs were in any way different from the open and globular cluster imfs ( as opposed to the pdmfs ) .",
    "this would indicate whether the types of star clusters that we find today are typical of the entire range of all star clusters ever formed .",
    "the wd mass fractions provide a particularly useful tool in this work as they are less sensitive to cluster dynamics than the mfs .",
    "i have undertaken a literature search through 31 july 1997 of white dwarfs ( wds ) in open and globular clusters .",
