    "the notion of viscosity solutions , introduced in the seminal papers @xcite and @xcite , provides the right class of generalized solutions to study existence , uniqueness , and stability issues for problem .",
    "the reader will find an overview of the main features of this theory in @xcite , for first order equations , and @xcite , for second order problems .",
    "on the other hand , it is also well known that hamilton - jacobi equations have no global smooth solutions , in general , because solutions may develop singularities ",
    "discontinuities of the gradient  in finite time due to crossing of characteristics .",
    "indeed , the maximal regularity one may expect for solutions of is that , for any @xmath7 , @xmath8 is locally semiconcave on @xmath9 , that is , @xmath8 can be represented as the sum of a concave and a smooth function on each compact subset of @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , the notion of semiconcave solution was used in the past even to provide existence and uniqueness results for before the theory of viscosity solution was developed , see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "nowadays , semiconcavity is still an important property in the study of hamilton - jacobi when related to optimal control problems in euclidean spaces ( @xcite ) and even on riemannian manifolds ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is rather regarded as a regularizing effect of the nonlinear semigroup associated with in some sense , a sign of irreversibility in hamilton - jacobi dynamics .",
    "another evidence of irreversibility for the equation @xmath10 is the _ persistence of singularities _ , that is , the fact that once a singularity is created , it will propagate forward in time up to @xmath11 . unlike the gain of semiconcavity , such a phenomenon is not well understood so far .    what is sufficiently clear to this date is the local propagating structure of the singular set of a viscosity solution @xmath12 of : if @xmath13 is a singular point of @xmath12 , then there exists a lipschitz arc @xmath14 such that @xmath15 is singular for all @xmath16 , see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "therefore , the question we are now interested in is to provide conditions to ensure that @xmath17 .",
    "we note that , in general , this problem has a negative answer if @xmath1 is allowed lipschitz dependence in @xmath18 even for @xmath19 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example  5.6.7 ) .    a first , simple case where the answer to the above problem is positive is when @xmath19 and @xmath1 is sufficiently smooth .",
    "indeed , the @xmath20-derivative of @xmath12 turns out to be a solution of a conservation law for which the results in @xcite ensure the persistence of singularities .",
    "however , the one - dimensional case is very special because topological obstructions prevent singularities from disappearing after their onset .",
    "another result that guarantees the global propagation of singularities in any space dimension was obtained in @xcite for _ concave _ solutions of the hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath21 requiring concavity  unlike semiconcavity  for @xmath12 is , however , a restrictive assumption because it imposes a global constraint on solutions . a last result , which is strongly related to the above problem , concerns the distance function , @xmath22 , from the boundary of a bounded open subset @xmath23 of a riemannian manifold .",
    "such a function is indeed the solution of a well known stationary hamilton - jacobi equation , that is , the eikonal equation . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the singular set of @xmath22 is invariant under the generalized gradient flow , a property which is crucial to prove that @xmath23 has the same homotopy type as the singular set of @xmath22 .    in this paper , we address the above problem for solution of the hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath24 where @xmath23 is a bounded domain in @xmath9 and @xmath25 is the quadratic form @xmath26 with @xmath27 a positive definite @xmath28 real matrix .",
    "our main result , theorem  [ th : persistence ] , ensures that the singularities of any viscosity solution of persist for all times , or at least until the singular arc touches the boundary of @xmath23 .",
    "more precisely , we show that , if @xmath29 is a singular point of @xmath12 , then there exist @xmath30 $ ] and a lipschitz continuous arc @xmath31 , starting from @xmath32 , with @xmath33 singular for all @xmath34 and such that @xmath35whenever @xmath36 .",
    "the proof of the above result relies on two main ideas that are converted in two technical results , respectively . in the first one , lemma  [ lm ] , we obtain , as in @xcite , a sharp semiconcavity estimate for a suitable transform of the solution @xmath12 . in the second one , theorem  [ th ] , we establish an inequality showing that the full hamiltonian associated with , that is , @xmath37 decreases along a selection of the superdifferential of @xmath12 , evaluated at any point of a suitable arc . to be more specific , let @xmath38 and let @xmath39 .",
    "then we prove that there exist @xmath40 and a lipschitz continuous arc @xmath41 , starting from @xmath32 , such that @xmath42 for every @xmath43 .",
    "such a dissipative behavior is essential to deduce persistence of singularities .",
    "indeed , the above inequality yields that , if @xmath29 is a singular point of @xmath12 , hence the minimum on the right - hand side is strictly negative , then the minimum on the left side must be negative too , thus forcing the point @xmath33 to be singular as well for every @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , the quantitative estimate allows to reproduce the above reasoning starting from @xmath44 as long as the arc @xmath45 stays away from the boundary of @xmath23 .",
    "although the structure of the hamiltonian in is quite special , we believe that our approach can be used to treat more complex classes of equations . in a future work",
    ", we will show how to adapt the above ideas to treat time dependent hamilton - jacobi equations on riemannian manifolds .",
    "let @xmath46 be an open set .",

    "we assume that the data @xmath53 satisfy the following compatibility condition @xmath54 for all @xmath55 such that @xmath56 .",

    "since the function @xmath12 given by is in general non differentiable , we denote by @xmath66 the set of points of non - differentiability for @xmath12 . for @xmath67",
    "we introduce the superdifferential of @xmath12 at @xmath68 @xmath69 and the set of the reachable gradients of @xmath12 at @xmath68 @xmath70 the directional derivative of @xmath12 at @xmath68 in the direction @xmath71 is defined by @xmath72 and the exposed face of @xmath73 in the direction @xmath74 by @xmath75    since @xmath12 is a locally semiconcave map , the set @xmath73 is the convex hull of @xmath76 .",
